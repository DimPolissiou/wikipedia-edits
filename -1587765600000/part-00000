It is commonly played by four players (with some three-player variations found in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Southeast Asia]]). The game and its regional variants are widely played throughout Eastern and South Eastern Asia and have also become popular in Western countries. The game has also been adapted into a widespread online entertainment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mahjong Around the World|url=http://worldmahjong.com/about-mahjong/mahjong-around-the-world/|publisher=World Series of Mahjong|access-date=25 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616042121/http://worldmahjong.com/about-mahjong/mahjong-around-the-world/|archive-date=16 June 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Vickroy|first1=Donna|title=Growing interest in ancient Chinese game|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/news/ct-sta-mahjong-interest-st-0326-20150325-story.html|work=Daily Southtown}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Glasser|first=AJ|title=Mad Respect for Mahjong on This Week's List of Fastest-Growing Games by DAU|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/mad-respect-for-mahjong-on-this-weeks-list-of-fastest-growing-games-by-dau/|work=Adweek|date=20 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=WITH VIDEO: 'Mahjong!' Ancient game enjoys continued popularity|url=http://thecourier.com/life-news/2016/06/23/mahjong/|work=The Courier}}</ref> Similar to the Western card game [[rummy]], Mahjong is a [[game of skill]], strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance.\n\nThe game is played with a set of 144 [[Mahjong tiles|tiles]] based on [[Chinese characters]] and [[chinese culture|symbols]], although some regional variations may omit some tiles or add unique ones. In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four [[#Melds|melds]] (or sets) and a pair (eye). A player can also win with a small class of special hands. There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, how a piece is robbed from another player, the use of simples (numbered tiles) and Honors (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds allowed, how to deal the tiles and the order of play. Despite these similarities, there are many regional variations to the rules including rather different scoring systems, criteria for legal winning hands, and even private table rules which distinguish some variations as notably different styles of mahjong.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn Chinese, the game was originally called {{lang|zh|\u9ebb\u96c0}} ({{zh|hp=m\u00e1qu\u00e8}}){{mdash}}meaning [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]{{mdash}}which is still used in some southern dialects. It is said that the clacking of tiles during shuffling resembles the chattering of sparrows. It has also been suggested that the name came from an evolution of an earlier card game called [[Madiao]] which mahjong tiles were adapted from.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The complete book of Mah-Jongg|last=Millington|first=A.

Its name is similar in other languages, except in [[Thai language|Thai]], where it is called \u0e44\u0e1e\u0e48\u0e19\u0e01\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e01 (''phai nok krachok''), a [[calque]] meaning \"sparrow cards.\"<ref>https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/28815/1/10672983.pdf</ref>\n\n== General rules ==\n[[File:Mahjong tiles on angle.jpg|thumb|A set of Mahjong tiles]]\n\nWhile mahjong itself has many variants, various game rules and mechanics are generally \"universal\".  Variations between mahjong forms rests on which game features are used or not.  Players of one form of mahjong may be able to learn another without too much difficulty, compared to an individual who has never played.\n\n=== Game pieces and accessories ===\n{{Main|Mahjong tiles}}\n\nOld Hong Kong Mahjong is played with a standard set of Mahjong tiles (though cards may be used). Sets often include counters (to keep score), dice (to decide how to deal), and a marker to show who the dealer is and which round is being played. Some sets include racks to hold the tiles, especially if they are larger or smaller than standard tiles or have an odd shape.\n\nA set of Mahjong tiles usually has at least 136 tiles (most commonly 144); however, sets originating from the United States or Southeast Asia will probably have more. Mahjong tiles are split into 3 categories: Suits, Honors, and Bonuses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Mahjong tile count per set\n|-\n| colspan=2 |\n!

The suits are bamboos, dots, and characters. There are 4 identical copies of each simples tile totaling 108 simples tiles.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|\n!colspan=9|Numbers\n|-\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Simples\n!Dots\n|[[File:MJt1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt7-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt8-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Bamboo\n|[[File:MJs1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs7-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs8-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Characters\n|[[File:MJw1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw7-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw8-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw9-.svg|50px]]\n|}\nThe bamboo suit is also known as \"sticks\" or \"bams\" suit; the first tile usually has a bird (traditionally, a peacock or sparrow) instead of a single bamboo. The dots suit is also known as the \"wheels\", \"circles\", \"balls\", \"stones\", '\"marbles\" or \"coins\" suit. The characters suit is also known as the \"cracks\" or \"numbers\" suit since the top characters are numbers in the Chinese orthography, and the bottom characters (in [[traditional Chinese characters]]) are the Chinese orthography of \"ten thousand\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://files.righto.com/chart.html |title=Mah Jongg Tiles and Names |author=Shirriff, Ken |publisher=righto.com |accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Honors tiles ====\nThere are two different sets of Honors tiles: Winds and Dragons. The Winds are East, South, West, and North. In Mahjong, East (not North) is the beginning. The Dragons are Red, Green, and White. The white dragon has a blue or black frame on the face of the piece or in some sets is entirely blank and are typically known as \u767d\u677f (b\u00e1ib\u0103n) \"whiteboard\". These tiles have no numerical sequence like the simples (for example the bamboo pieces number 1 to 9). Like the simples, there are four identical copies of each Honors tile, for a total of 28 Honors tiles.\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Winds\n!East\n!South\n!West\n!North\n|-\n|[[File:MJf1-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJf2-.svg|50px]]||[[File:MJf3-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJf4-.svg|50px]]\n|}\n|width=\"50%\"|\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dragons\n!Red\n!Green\n!White\n|-\n|[[File:MJd1-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJd2-.svg|50px]]||[[File:MJd3-.svg|50px]]\n|}\n|}\n\n==== Bonus tiles ====\nThere are two sets of Bonus tiles: Flowers and Seasons. The flower and season tiles play a unique role in the mechanics of the game. When drawn, the Bonus tile is not added into a player's hand but are instead set aside and kept near the player's other tiles for scoring purposes should they win the hand, and an extra tile is drawn in replacement of the Bonus tile.\n\nIn addition, unlike the Simple and Honors tiles, there is only a single tile of each Bonus tile, so there are a total of four flower and four season tiles in the set. The tiles have a different artistic rendering of a specific type of flower or season.\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Flowers\n! No !!

There is no relation between the bonus tile \"bamboo\" flower and the bamboo suit of simple tiles (ex. 2 bamboo). In traditional Chinese culture, the [[Four Gentlemen]] are the plum (winter), orchid (spring), bamboo (summer), and chrysanthemum (autumn) which are regarded as the representative plants of those seasons, but people regard it as plum blossom (spring), orchid (summer), chrysanthemum (autumn) and bamboo (winter) now.\n\n=== Choosing table positions and first dealer ===\n[[File:Chinese dice.jpg|thumb|Chinese dice]]\nThe dealer is chosen by various means. For example, each player throws dice with the highest count taking the dealer position, second-highest taking south etc. Or one player may place one tile of each wind face down and shuffle them. Each player randomly select one of these tiles and these tiles dictate their wind position. Each player sits down at their respective position (called the wind position) at the table in positions of an inverted compass: East is dealer, the right of the dealer is South, across is West, and the left is North. The order of play is traditionally counter-clockwise.\n\n=== Hands, rounds, and matches ===\n[[File:Tion-Mahjong.JPG|thumb|right|Cubic dealer and prevailing wind marker.]]\nA match consists of four rounds, each representing a \"prevailing wind,\" starting with East. Once the first round is completed, a second round begins with South as the prevailing wind, and so on. Wind position is significant in that it affects the scoring of the game. A Mahjong set with Winds in play will usually include a separate prevailing wind marker (typically a die marked with the Wind characters in a holder).\n\nIn each round at least four hands are played, with each player taking the position of dealer. In the first hand of each round, Player 1 (winner of the dice toss) is East and therefore dealer. In the second hand, Player 2 takes the East position, shifting the seat winds amongst the players counterclockwise (though players do not physically move their chairs). This continues until all four players have been East (dealer). A marker is used to mark which player is East and often the round number. (In sets with racks, a rack may be marked differently to denote the dealer.)\n\nWhenever a player in the East position (dealer) wins a hand, or if there is no winner (a draw or \"goulash hand\"), an extra hand is played with the same seating positions and prevailing wind as in the previous hand. This means that a match may potentially have no limit to the number of hands played (though some players will set a limit of three consecutive hands allowed with the same seat positions and prevailing wind).\n\nExample of games:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of a standard 16 hand game with two extra hands played<br/>(per no-winner-hand (goulash) and per east winning hand)\n!

By convention all players should participate in shuffling using both hands moving the pieces around the table rigorously and loudly for a lengthy period. Tiles may get flipped up during this process and players should flip them facing down as soon as possible to avoid identifying the location of the revealed tiles.\n\n====Stacking tiles====\n\nEach player then stacks a row of 18 tiles, two tiles high in front of them (for a total of 36 tiles). Players then push each side of their stack together to form a square wall.\n\n[[File:Mahjong table.svg|thumb|right|upright=2|Walls with slight diagonal offset and player positions marked with cardinal directions, including the dealer (E), along with counting order]]\nRegular players usually place their stacks in a slightly diagonal position (about 20 to 30 degrees anti-clockwise); the right end of their stack is pushed slightly further in to the centre of the table to meet almost the middle of the stack of the player on the right. This creates a smaller square wall the length of about half of each stack, with walls extended away from each corner of the square. The diagonally positioned stacks and a smaller square creates a bigger space for players' tiles and also makes an ergonomic position for drawing tiles from the stack.\n\n====Drawing tiles====\n\nThe dealer throws three dice in the square wall and sums up the total. Counting anti-clockwise so that the dealer is 1 (or 5, 9, 13, 17), so that south (player to the right) is 2 (or 6, 10, 14, 18), etc., a player's quarter of the wall is chosen. Some house rules may use only two dice but have double throws to increase randomness. In the case of double throws, the player of the chosen wall makes the second throw.\n\nUsing the same total on the dice (or the total of the two throws), the player whose wall is chosen then counts the stacks of tiles from right to left. (For double throws, the count may extend to the left side player's stack.) This determines the location where the 'deck' of tiles is cut. Starting from the left of the stacks counted, the dealer draws four tiles for himself, and players in anti-clockwise order draw blocks of four tiles until all players have 12 tiles, so that the stacks decrease clockwise. Each player then draws one last tile to make a 13-tile hand.\n\nDealing does not have to be strictly this way and may be done quite differently based on house rules. Tiles may flip over when being dealt and players should agree in advance on how to deal with the problem. Solutions include having the dealer penalised points, shuffling the turned over piece back into the wall somehow, allowing the player who the tiles were dealt to take the piece or not (meaning the dealer must take it as his/her 14th piece) or other house rules.\n\nEach player now sets aside any Flowers or Seasons they may have drawn and takes turns to draw replacement piece(s) from the wall in the anti-clockwise direction. If a player gets any Flowers or Seasons tiles in the replacement draw, the players must wait for the next turn to draw replacement tiles.\n\n[[File:Mahjong 13th piece draw.svg|thumb|left|While drawing the 13th piece to complete the initial hand, the dealer (E) will typically also draw a 14th piece (both highlighted in blue) to initiate the game.]]\n\n====Game play starts====\nThe dealer draws a piece from the wall in clockwise direction, adding it to their hand. Typically, this draw is performed during the initial deal to speed up play. If this does not complete a legal hand, the dealer then discards a piece (throwing it into the middle of the wall with no particular order in mind).\n\n=== Rules ===\n[[File:Lanzhou-019.JPG|right|thumb|Local play on the street in [[Lanzhou]] ]]\n\nEach player in turn, in counterclockwise direction, draws a tile from the wall; as long as the tile drawn is not one of the Bonus tiles, the player proceeds to discard a tile (either the tile just drawn, or a tile in the hand) to maintain a hand of 13. The discarded tile is thrown into the centre and, if desired, the player announces out loud what the piece is. The other players have an opportunity to seize the discarded tile; if no one takes it, the turn continues to the next player. Play continues this way until one player has a legal winning hand and calls out \"Mahjong\" while revealing their hand.\n\nThere are four different ways that regular order of play can be interrupted:\n#A Bonus tile (Flower or Season) is drawn\n#A meld (Pong, Kong, or Chow) is made from a discard\n#Going Mahjong (declaring a winning hand)\n#Robbing a Kong\n\nDuring play, each player's hand should always be 13 tiles (meaning in each turn a tile must be picked up and another discarded). The count of 13 tiles do not include any Bonus tiles (Flowers and Seasons), which are set to the side, nor does it include the fourth added piece of a Kong. If a player is seen to have fewer or more than 13 tiles in their hand outside of their turn they are penalised.\n\n==== Legal hand ====\nA winning hand consists of 14 tiles. Since players always have 13 tiles in their hand during play, they must win by either drawing a piece from the wall that completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning from the wall\") or claiming a discard from another player which completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning by discard\"). The winning hand is made of four ''melds'' (a specific pattern of three pieces) and the ''eyes'' (a pair of identical pieces). The exceptions to this rule are the special hands listed below.\n\nMost players play with a table minimum, meaning a winning hand must score a minimum number of points (which can be seen in the scoring section). In Hong Kong Mahjong the most common point set is three but can be higher or lower depending on house rules.\n\n==== Melds ====\n'''Melds''' are groups of tiles within the player's hand, consisting of either a ''Pong'' (three identical tiles), a ''Kong'' (four identical tiles), a ''Chow'' (three Simple tiles all of the same suit, in numerical sequence), or ''Eyes'' (two identical tiles needed in a winning hand). Melds may be formed by drawing a tile from the wall, or by seizing another player's discard. There are rules governing which player has priority for a discard, and whether the meld should be exposed (displayed to all players) or remain concealed, depending on the manner in which the meld is formed.\n\n* '''Pongs''' are a set of three identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]]\n\n[[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]]\n\nYou may form a Pong with any Simple or Honors tile. Bonus tiles (Flowers or Seasons) cannot be used to form a Pong because they are set aside and there are not three identical bonus tiles in the set. The tiles must be identical (you cannot mix suits). A Pong may either be concealed (formed by drawing tiles) or exposed (formed by seizing another player's discard).\n* '''Kong''' is a complete set of four identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]]\n\n[[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]]\n\nConsider a Kong the same as a Pong with an additional tile to make a complete set of four. There are three ways to form a Kong.\n:# ''Concealed Kong'' \u2013 If a player holds three matching tiles (concealed Pong) and upon drawing a tile completes a set of four they may declare a Kong. They do so by revealing the meld and placing two pieces in the middle face up and two pieces on the ends face down.\n:# ''Exposed Kong'' \u2013 If a player can use a discarded tile to complete three matching tiles (concealed Pong) in their hand, he can take the piece and reveal an \"exposed kong\" or \"melded kong\". The player reveals his three pieces face up and places the stolen discard on top of the middle tile, or face down next to the three other face up pieces.\n:# ''Exposed Kong from Exposed Pong'' \u2013 If a player already has a melded Pong and then later in the game draws the fourth piece from the wall, he may announce (then or later in the game) a Kong by placing the fourth tile on top of the middle piece of the melded Pong, or all four tiles placed face up in a row. If a Pong has been melded a player cannot steal the 4th piece if another player discards it, it must be drawn.\n\nWhenever a Kong is formed, that player must draw an extra tile from the end of the wall and then discard a tile. The fourth piece of a Kong is not considered as one of the 13 tiles a player must always have in their hand. A Kong may not be formed from Bonus tiles (Flowers/Seasons), since the set does not include four identical tiles. Kongs are worth collecting to score more points and deprive opponents of the opportunity to obtain specific tiles.\n* '''Chow''' is a meld of three suited tiles in sequence. For example:\n\n[[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8-.svg|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt6-.svg|25px|6 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]]\n\nThe meld must be in absolute numerical sequence and all in the same suit. Players cannot skip numbers or meld from the 8 or 9 to 1 or 2. Honors tiles cannot be used to make Chows because they have no numerical value, and Bonus tiles (Flowers and Seasons) also cannot be used to make a Chow.\n\nA player can steal a discard to form a Chow only from the player whose turn was immediately before theirs; however, a player forming a Chow from a seized piece has the lowest priority for that tile. Any other player who needs that tile to make a Pong, make a Kong, or to win may seize that piece instead. Like the Pong, the Chow is either concealed (formed by drawing tiles) or exposed (formed by seizing the prior player's discard).\n* '''Eyes''' (also known as a pair) are two identical tiles which are an essential part of a legal winning hand. A piece cannot be stolen (melded) to form a pair of eyes unless the player simultaneously completes a legal winning hand.<ref>Lo, Amy (2001). ''The Book of Mahjong: An Illustrated Guide''.

Flower or Season =====\nWhenever a player draws a flower or season, it is announced and then placed to the side (it is not considered a part of the 13-tile hand, but in the event that player wins, he may earn bonus points for them) and the last tile of the wall is drawn as a replacement tile so that the player has the 14 pieces needed before their discard. This may happen successively in a player's turn.\n\n===== 2. Melding another player's discard =====\nWhen a player discards a tile, other players may steal the tile to complete a meld. Stealing tiles has both advantages (quickly forming a winning hand and scoring extra points) and disadvantages (being forced to reveal part of one's hand to other players and not being able to change the meld once declared).\n\nWhen a meld (''Pong'', ''Kong,'' or ''Chow'') is declared through a discard, the player must state the type of meld to be declared and expose the meld by placing the three (or four) tiles face up. The player must then discard a tile, and play continues to the right. If the player who melds a discard is not directly after the discarder (in order of play), one or two players will essentially miss their turn as play continues anti-clockwise from the player who declared the meld.\n\nIf multiple players call for a discarded tile, priority for the discard depends on the declared action of the player stealing the discard.\n\n* # Highest priority goes to the player who needs the discarded tile to win the hand. A player may take the tile to win the hand from any other player.\n\n* # Next priority goes to the player who declares a ''Pong'' or ''Kong'' using the discard. A player who calls for a ''Pong'' or ''Kong'' may take the discard from any other player. Only one player can be in this position because there are only four of any tile in a Mahjong set.\n\n* # Last priority goes to the player who declares a Chow using the discard. Players may only call for a ''Chow'' from the discard of the player immediately prior to them, unless the tile is the final one required to complete the hand.\n\n===== 3. Winning a hand =====\nThe act of winning a hand interrupts play to assess the validity of the hand won.  Upon confirmation, the player is awarded the hand's value per the specific game's rule.\n\n======From a discard======\nIf at any point in the game a player can use another player's discard to complete a legal hand (and with the agreed minimum points), they declare a win and reveal their winning hand. This ends the hand, and scoring commences. If more than one player can use a discard to win the hand, multiple ways can handle the situation based on agreed table rules: Either the players count the points they would win with the discard and the winner is the one with the higher score, the winner is simply the player closest to the discarder in order of turn, or multiple players may be granted the win simultaneously.\n\n======From the wall======\nAlternatively, a player may also win by drawing a tile that completes a legal hand. This is called \"winning from the wall\". In Hong Kong mahjong, winning from the wall doubles the number of base points each loser must pay.\n\n======False Mahjong======\nTechnically, the declaration for winning a hand may be done at anytime.  However, the player must have a complete and legal hand.  Otherwise, the win declaration is penalized.  The penalty depends on table rules. The player may forfeit points to the other players. Another potential penalty is the player who called out the false mahjong must play the rest of the hand with their tiles face up on the table so other players can see them (open hand).  Some methods apply the penalty at the end of the entire game.  Again, the table rules dictate the enforcement of the penalty.\n\n===== 4. Robbing a Kong =====\nA rarely occurring and high-scoring feature of Hong Kong Mahjong is a move called robbing the Kong. If a player declares a Kong (either by melding it or adding a fourth piece to a Pong to form a Kong or declaring a concealed Kong) but another player can use that piece to complete a hand, the completing player takes priority to go Mahjong (win the hand) and may steal that piece from the player who intended to declare the Kong.\n\n==== Examples of winning hands ====\nBelow are two examples of winning hands. A winning hand must consist of four melds (Pongs, Kongs, or Chows) and a pair (eyes) and must also score the agreed table minimum.\n\n: [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] \u2013 [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]]\n''Hand formed with four Pongs and the eyes (pair) of East wind. Only bamboo is used (no other simples), scoring extra points (clean hand). No chows are used (an all Pong/Kong hand scores extra points).''\n\n: [[File:MJt1-.svg|25px|1 Circle]] [[File:MJt2-.svg|25px|2 Circle]] [[File:MJt3-.svg|25px|3 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt4-.svg|25px|4 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt6-.svg|25px|6 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt8-.svg|25px|8 Circle]] [[File:MJt8-.svg|25px|8 Circle]]\n''A high-scoring hand formed using only circles, known as a pure hand. Hand is made of Chows, Pongs and the eyes of circles.''\n\nMost players include table variations in their games, of which some non-standard are included. The hands of ''seven different pairs'' and ''13 orphans'' are examples which do not have four melds and the eyes. They are described in more detail below.\n\n==== Repeated hands ====\n\nIf the dealer wins the hand, he will remain the dealer and an extra hand is played in addition to the minimum 16 hands in a match.\n\nAn extra hand is also played if there is no winner by the time all the tiles in the wall have been drawn. When there is no winner it is known as a \"goulash hand\". Depending on table rules, the winner of the next game may take an agreed number of points from each player, carrying over the points from the non-winning hand to the winning one. If there are two or three goulash hands in a row then the winner would collect a considerable number of points from each player on top of their scoring hand. Because extra hands may be played every time a dealer wins or if there is a goulash hand, a match of 16 hands can easily become a match of 20 or even much more.\n\nAs table rules add a large amount of flexibility for players, they can choose to disregard the rule of extra hands and pass on the dealership regardless of who wins or if it results in a goulash hand. This puts a maximum estimated limit on the game duration and provides some amount of predictability.\n\n====Rhythm of play====\nPlayers may agree on table rules if the pace of the game is brisk or leisurely. For brisk games players may agree that a couple seconds after a discard are allowed for a \"window of opportunity\" before the next player picks up from the wall. Usually it is agreed once the next player has waited the duration of the \"window of opportunity\" and draws a tile from the wall, the previous discard is lost and cannot be claimed.\n\n=== Scoring ===\n{{Main|Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules}}\n\nOld Hong Kong scoring is relatively simple. There is only one winner (or if there is a draw the hand is replayed). The winner must have a legal hand that meets the minimum faan points agreed to in advance (not including any bonus points). Only the winner scores, the other players pay the winner various sums. After each hand ends, the winner counts all of his or her faan points.\n* faan points depend on:\n** the composition of the entire hand\n** how the hand was won\n** bonus tiles\n** special patterns\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum faan value agreed in advance (often 3). Bonus tiles and a few other elements are not included in the minimum faan value a player needs to form a legal winning hand. (i.e. in a three faan minimum game, if a player has two faan points and one bonus point, the player has not met the proper requirements to win and will need to gain another faan point before calling mahjong. Though the bonus points cannot be included in the minimum points needed to win, they are included in the overall score after a player wins\n* The other players do not score their hand. Once the winner has added his or her points (faan points plus bonus points) they must be converted into base points (the chart is below). These base points represent how much the opponents pay to the winner\n* Players then pay the winner (in money or when not gambling with \"chips or points\") based on three factors:\n** the base points (faan points and bonus points converted into a payment unit)\n** if the player won from the wall (doubles the points)\n** if the player was the dealer (doubles the points)\n\n==== Concealed vs. revealed meld and hand====\n\nA concealed meld is one that contains no tiles stolen from another players discard. A concealed hand is one made up of only concealed melds. Many variations distinguish between a concealed hand (winning from the wall) and a semi concealed hand (the last tile is a stolen discard). In most mahjong variations having a concealed hand can be valuable in scoring. Hong Kong mahjong doesn't award concealed melds/hands as generously as others. Concealed hands only the case with a few limit hands or half-limit hands (thirteen orphans, heavenly gates, four concealed pongs) as well as a complete hand (seven pairs) and over several melds (three concealed pongs).\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|+Meld summary\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Meld Type !! rowspan=2 | Quantity !! colspan=3 | Eligible tiles !! colspan=2 | When completed by ...\n|-\n!

How points are reckoned is agreed by players beforehand. For example, they can keep a tally, exchange chips or pay one another with money. The faan value of a hand is converted into base points which are then used to calculate the points the losers pay the winner. The table is progressive, doubling the number of base points when reaching a certain faan point target. The following is the Old Hong Kong simplified table, for other tables see [[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Base points (Old Hong Kong Simplified) \n! faan points !!  Base points\n|- style=\"background: white;\"\n| 3 || 1 \n|- style=\"background: #d3d3d3;\"\n| 4 || rowspan=3 | 2\n|- style=\"background: #d3d3d3;\"\n| 5\n|- style=\"background: #d3d3d3;\"\n| 6\n|- style=\"background: white;\"\n| 7 || rowspan=3 | 4\n|- style=\"background: white;\"\n| 8\n|- style=\"background: white;\"\n| 9\n|- style=\"background: #d3d3d3\"\n| 10+ || 8 (limit)\n|}\n\nThis table is based on play where 3 faan is the minimum needed in order to win with a legal hand. If a player has 3 faan then his hand is worth one base point. A winning hand with 9 faan is worth four base points. Losing players must give the winning player the value of these base points. The following special cases result in doubled base points:\n* If the winner wins from the wall his base points are doubled\n* If the hand was won by discard, the discarder doubles the amount he owes the winner\n* If the winner is east all losers double the basepoints\n* If east player is a losing player he pays double the points to the winner.\n\nIf two of these criteria apply to any player, he must double and then redouble the points owed to the winner.\n\n===== Examples =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ \n!Hand !!

These are exceptional hands, difficult to obtain and are very valuable in point scoring. As many table rules put a limit on the number of points a winners hand can score, full limit hands score that maximum. Table rules dictate if these rare and special hands are allowed, which ones, and the limit for scoring. A common scoring limit is 64 points, which is the highest base points doubled twice. A winner receives the scoring limit from each player without any doubling.\n\nSome limit hands by necessity must be completely concealed (not discards used) or semi-concealed (the only discard used is the one needed to go mahjong). This includes the 13 orphans, 4 concealed pongs, heavenly hand and earthly hand. It is usually expected that the heavenly gates hand be concealed or semi-concealed. As for the dragon limit hands and the great winds, table rules dictate if the hand must be concealed or not. Some table rules claim that a semi-concealed hand (winning from a discard) scores a half-limit.\n\nSome groups also play with the \"great Flowers\" rule. If a player picks up all four Flowers and all four Seasons during their hand, they instantly win the hand and receive the maximum points from all of the players. This is exceptionally rare.\n\nIn all the hands that require pongs, each pong can be replaced by the corresponding kong.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Limit Hands (Maximum number of fan agreed)\n! width=10% | Hand !! width=90% | Explanation with example\n|-\n!

In mainland China alone, there are over thirty variants.<ref name=\"Games and Culture\">{{cite arxiv |last1=Wang |first1=Xianwen |last2=Mao |first2=Wenli |last3=Liu |first3=Chen |title=Games and Culture: Using Online-gaming Data to Cluster Chinese Regional Cultures |ref=Games and Culture|eprint=1310.0621 |class=cs.CY |year=2013 }}</ref> Many variations today differ only by scoring:\n\n* '''[[Chinese classical Mahjong]]''' is the oldest surviving variety of Mahjong and was the version introduced to America in the 1920s under various names. It has a small, loyal following in the West, although few play it in Asia. All players score and it is possible to score higher than the winner.\n* '''[[Hong Kong Mahjong]]''' or '''Cantonese Mahjong''' is a more common form of Mahjong, differing in minor scoring details from the Chinese Classical variety. It does not allow multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''[[Competition Mahjong scoring rules|Competition Mahjong]]''' is an international standard founded by All-China Sports Federation in July 1998 that some Mahjong societies have adopted for competition play and in some cases for all play.\n* '''Sichuan Mahjong''' is a growing variety, particularly in southern China, disallowing chi melds, and using only the suited tiles. Play continues until a loser is decided or a draw. It can be played very quickly.\n* '''Wuhan Mahjong''' is growing rapidly and become popular in southern China. It is different from other parts of China such that it has a tile that can be used as everything called Laizi ({{lang|zh|\u8d56\u5b50}}), and the player has to have a set of special two tiles, namely two, five, eight, as prerequisite for winning. Another variation has become the new trend, and is called {{lang|zh|\u7ea2\u4e2d\u8d56\u5b50\u6760}}. Special tiles need to be discarded.\n* '''Changsha Mahjong''' is widely played in [[Hunan]] Province. Like Wuhan Mahjong, players need to obtain special Jong consisting of only tiles of two, five or eight. Changsha Mahjong forbids using winds and some special tiles, those tiles are first drawn out from the table when playing. Winners each round get a special drawing session for bonuses, usually doubling the score.\n* '''Tianjin Mahjong''' using normally seven jokers, with special scoring such as ''joker-free'', ''joker-waiting-pair'', ''catch-5'', ''dragon'', ''joker-suited-dragon''.\n* '''Shenyang Mahjong''' using 13 hands in a game, and Shenyang Mahjong has a really fast speed on playing, which allegedly might be said in some regard to perhaps match the personality of north-east people in China. Also in Shenyang Mahjong, the player must to have Bamboos, Characters, Circles and number one or nine in his hand. In addition, the players have to Pong before they Chow, so there is no chance to win even if some players win at the first time they have their hands in hand.\n* '''[[Taiwanese Mahjong]]''' is the variety prevalent in Taiwan and involves hands of sixteen tiles (as opposed to the thirteen-tile hands in other versions), features bonuses for dealers and recurring dealerships, and allows multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''[[Filipino Mahjong]]''', sixteen tile hands. Certain tiles can be wild. Honors are treated as bonuses.\n* '''Fujian Mahjong''', thirteen tile hands. Certain tiles can be wild. No dragons. Winds are treated as bonuses.\n* '''Taiyuan Lisi Mahjong''', or ''Lisi'' (Raise 4; {{lang|zh|[[:zh:\u592a\u539f\u7acb\u56db\u9ebb\u5c06]]}}), the players must win with the first four blocks drawn which are placed separately in front of other. These four blocks cannot be touched until the player has a ready hand.\n* '''[[Singaporean mahjong|Singaporean-Malaysian Mahjong]]''' are two similar variants with much in common with Hong Kong mahjong. Unique elements of Singaporean-Malaysian Mahjong are the use of four animal bonus tiles (cat, mouse, cockerel, and centipede) as well as certain alternatives in the scoring rules, which allow payouts midway through the game if certain conditions (such as a ''kong'') are met. Melds may also be presented in a form different to most other variations.\n* '''South African Mahjong''' is a variant of Cantonese Mahjong. It is very similar in terms of game play and follows most of the rules and regulations of Cantonese Mahjong. However, there are some minor differences in scoring, e.g. the limit on the maximum points a hand can be rewarded is three or four ''fan'' depending on the ''house'' rules. A chicken hand (gai wu) is normally considered a value hand. Depending on the ''house'' rules ''Flowers'' may also be used to boost scoring.\n* '''Thai Mahjong''' has eight specialized jokers with eight extra flowers and eight animals for a total of 168 tiles.\n* '''Vietnamese Mahjong''' has the same eight specialized jokers but with only eight different extra flowers for a total of 160 tiles. Modern variant triplicates or quadruplicates the jokers for a total of 176 or 184 tiles.\n* '''Japanese classical Mahjong''' is still used in tournaments. It is closer to the Chinese classical scoring system but only the winner scores. \n* '''[[Japanese Mahjong]]''' is a standardized form of Mahjong in Japan and is also found prevalently in video games. In addition to scoring changes, the rules of ''[[Japanese Mahjong#R\u012bchi|r\u012bchi]]'' (ready hand) and ''[[Japanese Mahjong scoring rules#Dora|dora]]'' (bonus tiles) are unique highlights of this variant. In addition, tile discards are specifically arranged in front of each player by discard order, to take discarded tiles into account during play. Some rules replace some number 5 tiles with red tiles so that they can eventually get more value.<!--A standard rule set for Japanese mahjong was designed in 2008 by the European Mahjong Association,<ref>[http://gamenoodle.blogspot.com/2012/09/mahjongs.html European Mahjong Association]</ref> in cooperation with the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, in order to organize the first European Riichi Mahjong Championship in Hanover, Germany, June 2008. Danish player Thomas Kragh was the winner.<ref>[http://www.mahjongnews.com/en/index.php/ec-riichi/54-ec-2008/104-rmc2008.html]</ref>-->\n* '''Korean Mahjong''' is unique in many ways and is an excellent version for three players. One suit is omitted completely (usually the Bamboo set or 2\u20138 of bamboo) as well as the Seasons. The scoring is simpler and the play is faster. No melded chows are allowed and concealed hands are common. Riichi (much like its Japanese cousin) is an integral part of the game as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:korean-overview|title=Korean Mahjong Rules - Mahjong Wiki (\u9ebb\u5c06\u7ef4\u57fa)|website=mahjong.wikidot.com}}</ref>\n* '''Pussers bones''' is a fast-moving variant developed by sailors in the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. It uses an alternative vocabulary, such as ''Eddie'', ''Sammy'', ''Wally'', and ''Normie'', instead of ''East'', ''South'', ''West'', and ''North'' respectively.\n* '''Western classical Mahjong''' is a descendant of the version of Mahjong introduced by Babcock to America in the 1920s. Today, this term largely refers to the \"[[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright-Patterson]]\" rules, used in the U.S. military, and other similar American-made variants that are closer to the Babcock rules.\n* '''[[American mahjong|American Mahjong]]''' is a form of Mahjong standardized by the National Mah Jongg League<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org |title=National Mahjjong League |publisher=Nationalmahjonggleague.org |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> and the American Mah-Jongg Association.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amja.net/|title=The American Mah-Jongg Association \u2013 news, products and tournaments \u2013 Join us for our next American Mah-Jongg tournament or cruise!.}}</ref> It uses joker tiles, the Charleston, plus melds of five or more tiles, treats bonus tiles as Honors, and eschews the Chow and the notion of a standard hand. Legal hands are changed annually. Purists claim that this makes American Mahjong a separate game. In addition, the NMJL and AMJA variations, which have minor scoring differences, are commonly referred to as ''Mahjongg'' or ''mah-jongg'' (with 2 Gs, often hyphenated).\n\n'''[[Three player mahjong|Three-player Mahjong]]''' (or 3-''ka'') is a simplified three-person Mahjong that involves hands of 13 tiles (with a total of 84 tiles on the table) and may use jokers depending on the variation. Any rule set can be adapted for three players; however, this is far more common and accepted in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. It usually eliminates one suit entirely, or tiles 2\u20138 in one suit leaving only the terminals. It needs fewer people to start a game and the turnaround time of a game is short\u2014hence, it is considered a fast game. In some versions there is a jackpot for winning in which whoever accumulates a point of 10 is considered to hit the jackpot or whoever scores three hidden hands first. The Malaysian and Korean versions drop one wind and may include a seat dragon.<ref>The Mahjong Wiki.[http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:three-player Three-player mahjong]. Retrieved 17 November 2017.</ref>\n\n=== Equipment ===\n\n==== Tables ====\n[[File:Open the mah-jong table (3599421021).jpg|thumb|right|Interior of an automatic mahjong table.]]\nMahjong tables are square and small enough to be within arm's length of all equipment. The edges are raised to prevent tiles from sliding off and the surface is covered in felt to limit wear on the tiles. Automatic dealing tables, often used for high stakes playing and tournaments, are able to shuffle tiles, build walls, and randomize dice. It is an elaborate device built into a table which uses two alternating sets of tiles. It prepares one wall while the players play one hand. After the hand is finished the tiles are dropped into the table and a new wall raises upwards. In theory the table should avoid cheating (by stacking the deck and or using loaded dice).\n\n====Tiles====\nThe following chart shows the most generic set of tiles \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|\n!colspan=11|Numbers\n|-\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!colspan=2|8\n!colspan=2|9\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Suits\n!Dots\n|[[File:MJt1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJt8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJt9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Bamboo\n|[[File:MJs1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJs8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJs9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Characters\n|[[File:MJw1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJw8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJw9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=4|Honors/Bonus\n!colspan=4|Winds\n!colspan=3|Dragons\n!colspan=4|Bonus\n|-\n!East\n!South\n!West\n!North\n!Red\n!Green\n!White\n!colspan=2|Seasons\n!colspan=2|Flowers\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf1-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf2-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf3-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf4-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd1-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd2-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJh1-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh2-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh5-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh6-.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|[[File:MJh3-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh4-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh7-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh8-.svg|25px]]\n|}\n\nThere are variations that feature specific use of tiles. Some three-player versions remove the North Wind and one Chinese provincial version has no Honors. Korean Mahjong removes the bamboo suit or at least its numbers 2\u20138 so that terminals can be used. Japanese Mahjong rarely uses Flowers or Seasons. The Seasons are removed in Korean Mahjong, while many Southeast Asian sets have more flower series.\n\n==== Wild cards and jokers ====\n\nSome mahjong variants accept wildcard tiles. The wildcard tiles are decided at the beginning of the game by choosing one random tile. The wild card could be the immediately following tile on the wall, after distributing tiles to all players, or it could also be separately decided by a dice throw. Wildcard tiles can't be discarded and can only replace tiles in Chows. Wildcard tiles cannot replace tiles in Pongs and Kongs. For example, if a character 4 is chosen, then character 4 and the next sequential tile, character 5, can be used as wild cards in this round. (When the wildcard indicator is chosen and exposed, only 3 tiles remain of the same denomination, so the next tile in the suit will also be used as a wildcard, adding to 7 wildcard tiles for 4 players.) Also, if a tile numbered 9 is the indicator, the suits circle back to 1, after 9. Thus, the number 9 and 1 are wild cards.\n\nAlso, if the chosen tile is not in the suited tiles, the wild cards are decided in rules:\n[[File:Joker-vietnammj.JPG|right|thumb|Top eight are Vietnamese jokers. Bottom four are Chinese.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Wild card tile chosen !! Another wildcard\n|-\n| East || South\n|-\n| South || West\n|-\n| West || North\n|-\n| North || East\n|-\n| Red Dragon || Green Dragon\n|-\n| Green Dragon || White Dragon\n|-\n| White Dragon || Red Dragon\n|}\n\nThe bonus tiles are not available for wild cards.\n\nA feature of several variations of Mahjong, most notably in American mahjong, is the notion of some number of Joker tiles. They may be used as a wild card: a substitute for any tile in a hand, or, in some variations, only tiles in melds. Another variation is that the Joker tile may ''not'' be used for melding. Depending on the variation, a player may replace a Joker tile that is part of an exposed meld belonging to any player with the tile it represents.\n\nRules governing discarding Joker tiles also exist; some variations permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of any tile, and others only permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of the previously discarded tile (or the absence of a tile, if it is the first discard).\n\nJoker tiles may or may not affect scoring, depending on the variation. Some special hands may require the use of Joker tiles (for example, to represent a \"fifth tile\" of a certain suited or honor tile).\n\nIn American Mahjong, it is illegal to pass Jokers during the Charleston.\n\n===== Flowers =====\nJapanese rule sets discourage the use of Flowers and Seasons. Korean rules and three-player Mahjong in the Korean/Japanese tradition use only Flowers. In Singapore and Malaysia an extra set of bonus tiles of four animals are used. The rule set includes a unique function in that players who get two specific animals get a one-time immediate payout from all players. In Taiwanese Mahjong, getting all eight Flowers and Seasons constitutes an automatic win of the hand and specific payout from all players.\n\nFour of the flower tiles represent the [[Four Gentlemen|four noble plants]] of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] reckoning:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc22 }}[[Prunus mume|plum]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc23 }}[[orchid]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc25 }}[[chrysanthemum]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc24 }}[[bamboo]].\n\n[[File:MJh5-.svg|50px|Plum]] [[File:MJh6-.svg|50px|Orchid]] [[File:MJh7-.svg|50px|Chrysanthemum]] [[File:MJh8-.svg|50px|Bamboo]]\n\nThe other 4 flower tiles (or season tiles) represent Seasons:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc26 }} [[spring (season)|spring]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc27 }} [[summer]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc28 }} [[autumn]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc29 }}[[winter]].\n\n[[File:MJh1-.svg|50px|Spring]] [[File:MJh2-.svg|50px|Summer]] [[File:MJh3-.svg|50px|Autumn]] [[File:MJh4-.svg|50px|Winter]]\n\nThese animal tiles are used in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and local variations. They represent the [[cat]], [[mouse]], [[rooster]] and [[centipede]]. Like flower tiles, they also function as bonus tiles. However, as they have no corresponding seat position, any player who draws one of these gets a bonus point.\n\n[[File:MJat1-.svg|50px|Cat]] [[File:MJat2-.svg|50px|Mouse]] [[File:MJat3-.svg|50px|Rooster]] [[File:MJat4-.svg|50px|Centipede]]\n\n===== Walls =====\nAll tiles are placed face down and shuffled. Each player then stacks a row of tiles two tiles high in front of him, the length of the row depending on the number of tiles in use:\n* 136 tiles: 17 stacks for each player\n** Suits of circles, bamboos, and characters + winds + dragons\n* 144 tiles: 18 stacks for each player\n* 148 tiles: 19 stacks for dealer and player opposite, 18 for rest\n* 152 tiles: 19 stacks for each player\n\n====Dice, markers, and counting pieces====\n[[File:Mahjong fiches.jpg|thumb|right|Mahjong counting sticks: Left are Chinese while the right are Japanese]]\nDepending on the variation, two or three [[dice]] are usually used to decide what part of the wall to start dealing from. They are six-sided dice, traditionally but not necessarily Chinese dice with red one and four pips.\n\nThe dealer marker is a round or square object that the dealer places to the side to remind players who the dealer is. The wind marker may be used which indicates the current prevailing wind. In some cases the dealer marker and the wind marker are represented by one large marker, usually a small wheel where one can swivel the outer circle to indicate the prevailing wind (which the dealer holds onto), a cube with the four winds placed onto four of the sides which can be placed in a hollow square (the dealer holds onto it), or a cylinder locked into frame which can be rolled to expose the wind on the top. Japanese mahjong, especially in a gambling environment, may optionally use four yakitori markers to indicate which players have not won a hand yet and has to pay a penalty.\n\nThere are a variety of counting pieces used in different countries. They range from Chinese or Japanese counting sticks (thin sticks with various dots on them to represent various points), [[jeton]]s, [[play money]], paper and pencil, or various apps on touchscreen devices used to calculate and keep scores.\n\n=== Rules ===\nJapanese and Korean Mahjong have some special rules. A player cannot win by a discard if that player had already discarded that piece, where players' discards are kept in neat rows in front of them. Players may declare ready, meaning that they need one tile to win, cannot change their hand and win extra points if they win. Some rules may replace some of the number 5 tiles with red tiles, as they can earn more points. Korean Mahjong does not allow melded (stolen) chows.\nTaiwanese Mahjong adds three tiles to a hand requiring a 5th set to be formed, making a clean hand or all Pong hand very difficult to procure.\nAmerican Mahjong has distinctive game mechanics and the article on [[American mahjong|American Mahjong]] details these. Some differences include many special patterns, a different scoring system and the use of jokers and five-of-a-kind.\n\n==== Charleston ====\nIn the American variations it is required that, before each hand begins, a Charleston be enacted. In the first exchange, three tiles are passed to the player on one's right; in the next exchange, the tiles are passed to the player opposite, followed by three tiles passed to the left. If all players are in agreement, a second Charleston is performed; however, any player may decide to stop passing after the first Charleston is complete. The Charleston is followed by an optional pass to the player across of one, two, or three tiles. The Charleston, a distinctive feature of American Mahjong, may have been borrowed from card games such as [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]].\n\n=== Hands ===\nMany variations have specific hands, some of which are common while some are optional depending on regions and players. One example is the Pure Green hand made of chows or Pongs using 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 of bamboo and green dragon.\n\n==== Ready hands ====\nWhen a hand is one tile short of winning (for example: [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8-.svg|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]], waiting for: [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]], [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]], or [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]], as [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] can be the eyes), the hand is said to be a ready hand, or more figuratively, \"on the pot\". The player holding a ready hand is said to be ''waiting'' for certain tiles. It is common to be waiting for two or three tiles, and some variations award points for a hand that is waiting for one tile. In 13-tile Mahjong, the largest number of tiles for which a player can wait is 13 (the ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'', or ''13 orphans'', a nonstandard special hand). Ready hands must be declared in some variations of Mahjong, while other variations prohibit the same.\n\nSome variations of Mahjong, most notably Japanese and Korean ones, allow a player to declare {{nihongo||\u7acb\u76f4|r\u012bchi|sometimes known as ''reach'', as it is phonetically similar}}. A declaration of ''r\u012bchi'' is a promise that any tile drawn by the player is immediately discarded unless it constitutes a win. Standard requirements for ''r\u012bchi'' are that the hand be ''closed'' or have no melds declared (other than a concealed Kong) and that players already have points for declaration of ''r\u012bchi''. A player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and wins usually receives a point bonus for their hand directly, and a player who won with ''r\u012bchi'' also has the advantage to open the inner {{nihongo||\u30c9\u30e9|dora|from \"dra\"gon}} which leads to higher possibilities to match such a card, thus has more chance to grant additional bonus. However, a player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and loses is usually penalised in some fashion. Declaring a nonexistent ''r\u012bchi'' is also penalised in some way.\n\nIn some variations, a situation in which all four players declare a ''r\u012bchi'' is an automatic drawn game, as it reduces the game down to pure luck, i.e., who gets their needed tile first.\n\n=== Draws ===\nIf only the dead wall remains (or if no dead wall exists and the wall is depleted) and no one has won, the hand is drawn (\u6d41\u5c40 ''li\u00fa j\u00fa'', \u9ec3\u838a ''hu\u00e1ng zhu\u0101ng'', Japanese \u6d41\u5c40 ''ry\u016bkyoku''), or \"[[goulash]]ed\". A new hand begins, and depending on the variant, the Game Wind may change. For example, in most playing circles in Singapore, if there is at least one Kong when the hand is a draw, the following player of the dealer becomes the next dealer; otherwise, the dealer remains dealer.\n\nJapanese Mahjong has a special rule called {{nihongo||\u4e09\u5bb6\u548c|''sanchah\u014d''}}, which is, if three players claim the same discard in order to win, the hand is drawn. One reason for this is that there are cases in which bars of 1,000 points for declaring ''r\u012bchi'' cannot be divided by three. The rule is treated the same as \"abortive draws\".\n\n==== Abortive draws ====\nIn Japanese Mahjong, rules allow abortive draws to be declared while tiles are still available. They can be declared under the following conditions:\n* {{nihongo||\u4e5d\u7a2e\u4e5d\u724c|Ky\u016bshu Ky\u016bhai}}: On a player's first turn when no meld has been declared yet, if a player has nine different terminal (also known as major<ref>{{cite web|last=Gregory |first=Peter |url=http://mahjongbritishrules.com/scoring/index.html |title=Tile Classification |publisher=Mahjongbritishrules.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>) or honor tiles, the player may declare the hand to be drawn (for example, [[File:MJt1-.svg|25px|1 Circle]] [[File:MJt4-.svg|25px|4 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs6-.svg|25px|6 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJw1-.svg|25px|1 Character]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf3-.svg|25px|West Wind]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]], but could also go for the nonstandard ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'' hand as well).\n* {{nihongo|Four Winds' barrier|\u56db\u98a8\u5b50\u9023\u6253|S\u016bfontsu rent\u0101}}: On the first turn without any meld declarations, if all 4 players discard the same Wind tile, the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo||\u56db\u4eba\u7acb\u76f4|Yonin r\u012bchi}}: If all four players declare ''r\u012bchi'', the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo|Four Kongs' abort|\u56db\u69d3\u6563\u4e86|S\u016bkan sanra}}: The hand is drawn when the fourth Kong is declared, unless all four Kongs were declared by a single player. Still, the hand is drawn when another player declares a fifth Kong.\n\n===Scoring===\nScoring in Mahjong involves points, with a monetary value for points agreed upon by players. Although in many variations scoreless hands are possible, many require that hands be of some point value in order to win the hand.\n\nWhile the basic rules are more or less the same throughout Mahjong, the greatest divergence between variations lies in the scoring systems. Like the rules, there is a generalized system of scoring, based on the method of winning and the winning hand, from which Chinese and Japanese base their roots. American Mahjong generally has greatly divergent scoring rules, as well as greatly divergent general rules.\n\nBecause of the large differences between the various systems of scoring (especially for Chinese variants), groups of players will often agree on particular scoring rules before a game.\n\n====Points====\nPoints (terminology of which differs from variation to variation) are obtained by matching the winning hand with different criteria scoring different values. The points obtained may be modified into scores for each player using some (typically [[exponential function|exponential]]) functions. Some criteria may be also in terms of both points and score.\n\nIn many variations the dealer receives no scoring bonus and does not maintain his turn by winning or a dead hand.\n\nIn classical Mahjong all players score points. Points are given for sets and hand composition and winning bonuses, doubled and redoubled for basic patterns. Sometimes a loser may score more points than a winner. Japanese Mahjong has a complex scoring system with several stages of scoring, rules and exceptions, evening out scores and bonus points at the end of a match. Korean Mahjong has a simple scoring system where only winner scores without any form of doubling.\n\nSome variations give points for concealed hands, in which case no melds are made except by winning on a discard.\n\nIn Old Hong Kong Mahjong:\n* Only the winner scores points.\n* Winning hands are scored by totaling the point value of each element in the hand. Points are distinct from the actual payment received from each player.\n* The winner receives points (also known as faan among some players) for:\n** individual melds,\n** the composition of the entire hand,\n** how the hand was won,\n** bonus tiles,\n** special patterns,\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum points agreed in advance (often 3).\n* Bonus points are separate from the minimum points a player needs to win.\n* If a player goes Mahjong with a legal and minimum hand, his hand is scored by adding his points and bonus points together.\n* The payment received from each player depends on three factors:\n** the point value of the hand,\n** if the player won from a discard or from the wall, and\n** if the player was the dealer or not.\n\n=== Comparison ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Mahjong Variations\n!

The game is entirely unrelated to mahjong or its variations and is a recent invention. A two player version was published by [[Nintendo]]. The game involves stacking tiles face up in various elaborate patterns and removing uncovered matching tiles at the end of rows.\n\n== Competition ==\n[[File:wk-mahjong2002.jpg|thumb|The top 3 in the [[World Mahjong Championship]] in [[Tokyo]], October 2002. Left: John J. O'Connor (2nd place) In the middle: world champion Mai Hatsune, from Japan Right: Yuichi Ikeya (3rd place)]]\n\nIn 1998, in the interest of dissociating illegal gambling from Mahjong, the [[China State Sports Commission]] published a new set of rules, now generally referred to as Chinese Official rules or International Tournament rules (see [[Guobiao Majiang]]). The principles of the new, wholesome Mahjong are no gambling, no drinking, and no smoking. In international tournaments, players are often grouped in teams to emphasize that Mahjong from now on is considered a sport.\n\nThe new rules are highly pattern-based. The rulebook contains 81 combinations, based on patterns and scoring elements popular in classic and modern regional Chinese variants; some table practices of Japan have also been adopted. Points for flower tiles (each flower is worth one point) may not be added until the player has scored eight points. The winner of a game receives the score from the player who discards the winning tile, plus eight basic points from each player; in the case of ''zimo'' (self-drawn win), he receives the value of this round plus eight points from all players.\n\nThe new rules were first used in an international tournament in [[Tokyo]], where, in 2002, the [[2002 World Championship in Mahjong|first global tournament in Mahjong]] was organized by the Mahjong Museum, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, and the city council of Ningbo, China. One hundred players participated, mainly from Japan and China, but also from Europe and the United States. Mai Hatsune, from Japan, became the first world champion. The following year saw the first annual China Mahjong Championship, held in Hainan; the next two annual tournaments were held in Hong Kong and Beijing. Most players were Chinese; players from other nations attended as well.\n\nIn 2005, the first [[Open European Mahjong Championship]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mahjongnews.com/oemc2005.htm |title=The Independent Internet Mahjong Newspaper |publisher=Mahjongnews.com |accessdate=7 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012145919/http://mahjongnews.com/oemc2005.htm |archive-date=12 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> was held in the Netherlands, with 108 players.

There were 152 participants.\n\nIn 2006, the [[World Mahjong Organization]] (WMO) was founded in [[Beijing]], China, with the cooperation of, amongst others, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee (JMOC) and the European Mahjong Association (EMA). This organization held its first [[World Mahjong Championship]] in November 2007 in the Chinese town of [[Chengdu]], attended by 144 participants from all over the world. It was won by Li Li, a Chinese student at [[Tsinghua University]]. The next World Championship took place in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], the Netherlands, 27 to 29 August 2010.\n\nOther major international tournaments include the [[Mahjong International League]]'s [[World Mahjong Sports Games]] and the privately sponsored [[World Series Of Mahjong]].\n\n[[American mahjong]] tournaments are held in virtually every state\u2014the largest is in Las Vegas, Nevada twice a year, and in Atlantic City, New Jersey, by Mah Jongg Madness; and the annual cruise hosted by the National Mah Jongg League and Mah Jongg Madness (MJM). MJM tournaments host between 150 and 500 participants at these larger events; and there are several smaller scale, but equally successful tournaments held annually by other hosts. Prize pools are based on the number participating. Rules are based on the National Mah Jongg League standard rules.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:\u6cad\u967d\u7d19\u724c.png|thumb|Money-suited cards]]\nMahjong is based on draw-and-discard [[card games]] that were popular in 18th and 19th century China, some of which are still popular today.<ref name=Lo>{{cite book|last1=Lo|first1=Andrew|title='China's Passion for Pai: Playing Cards, Dominoes, and Mahjong'.

Each deck is divided into three suits of '''[[Cash (Chinese coin)|Cash]]''' or coins, '''[[String of cash coins (currency unit)|Strings]]''' of cash, and '''[[Myriad]]s''' of strings. There are nine ranks in each suit. In addition, there are three [[Wild card (card games)|wild cards]]: '''Red flower''', '''White flower''', and '''Old thousand'''. Depending on the game, there are multiple copies of each card.\n\nGames scholar [[David Parlett]] has written that the Western card games [[Conquian]] and [[Rummy]] share a common origin with Mahjong.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parlett|first=David|title=The Penguin Book of Card Games|year=1978|isbn=978-0-14-103787-5}}</ref> All these games involve players drawing and discarding tiles or cards to make [[Meld (cards)|melds]]. [[Khanhoo]] is an early example of such a game. The most likely ancestor to Mahjong was ''p\u00e8ngh\u00fa'' ([[:zh:\u78b0\u548c|\u78b0\u548c]]) which was played with 120 or 150 cards.<ref name=Lo/> During the late 19th century, ''p\u00e8ngh\u00fa'' was used interchangeably with ''m\u00e1qu\u00e8'' in both card and tile form.\n\nIt is not known when the conversion from cards to tiles took place precisely but it most likely occurred in the middle of the 19th century. The earliest surviving tile sets date to around 1870 and were acquired in [[Fuzhou]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Ningbo]].<ref name=Lo/><ref name=\"Stanwick1\">{{cite journal|last1=Stanwick|first1=Michael|title=Mahjong(g) Before Mahjong(g): Part 1|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2004|volume=32|issue=4|pages=153\u2013162|ref=Stanwick1}}</ref><ref>Sloper, Tom.

It became a success in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the co-owner of the company, [[Ezra Fitch]], sent emissaries to Chinese villages to buy every Mahjong set they could find. Abercrombie & Fitch sold a total of 12,000 Mahjong sets.\n\nAlso in 1920, [[Joseph Park Babcock]] published his book ''Rules of Mah-Jongg'', also known as the \"red book\". This was the earliest version of Mahjong known in America. Babcock had learned Mahjong while living in China. His rules simplified the game to make it easier for Americans to take up, and his version was common through the Mahjong fad of the 1920s. Later, when the 1920s fad died out, many of Babcock's simplifications were abandoned.\n\nThe game has taken on a number of trademarked names, such as \"Pung Chow\" and the \"Game of Thousand Intelligences\". Mahjong nights in America often involved dressing and decorating rooms in Chinese style.<ref>[[Bill Bryson]], ''[[Made in America (book)|Made in America]]''. Harper, 1996, ch. 16.</ref> Several hit songs were recorded during the Mahjong fad, most notably \"Since Ma Is Playing Mah Jong\" by [[Eddie Cantor]].<ref name=slope/>\n\nMany variants of Mahjong developed during this period. By the 1930s, many revisions of the rules developed that were substantially different from Babcock's classical version (including some that were considered fundamentals in other variants, such as the notion of a standard hand). The most common form, which eventually became \"American Mahjong\", was most popular among [[American Jews|Jewish]] women.<ref name=slope/> Standardization came with the formation of the National Mah Jongg League (NMJL) in 1937, along with the first American Mahjong rulebook, ''Maajh: The American Version of the Ancient Chinese Game'', written by NMJL's first president and co-founder, Viola L. Cecil.<ref>Tom Sloper, ''The Red Dragon & The West Wind: The Winning Guide to Official Chinese & American Mah-Jongg'', HarperCollins, 2007.''</ref>\n\nMany consider the modern American version a Jewish remake,<ref name=slope>{{cite web |url=http://www.sloperama.com/mjfaq/mjfaq19.html#t |title=Why are so many players of American mah-jongg Jewish? |publisher=Sloperama.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> as many American Mahjong players are of Jewish descent. The NMJL was founded by Jewish players and is considered a Jewish organization. In 1986, the National Mah Jongg League conducted their first Mah Jongg Cruise Tournament, in conjunction with Mah Jongg Madness. In 2010, this large scale seagoing event hosted its 25th Silver Anniversary Cruise, with players from all over the States and Canada participating.\n\nIn 1999, a second organization was formed, the American Mah Jongg Association. The AMJA currently hosts tournaments all across North America, with their signature event being at the [[Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort]] in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] before it went bankrupt and closed on October 10, 2016.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, British author Alan D. Millington revived the Chinese classical game of the 1920s with his book ''The Complete Book of Mah-jongg'' (1977). This handbook includes a formal rules set for the game.\n\n=== Current development ===\n[[File:Schoolkidsmahjong.jpg|thumb|200px|Students in the United States learning how to play Mahjong]]\nThere are many governing bodies which often host exhibition games and tournaments for modern and traditional Mahjong gaming.\n\nMahjong, as of 2010, is the most popular table game in Japan.<ref>Pakarnian, John, \"Game Boy:  Glossary of Japanese Gambling Games\", ''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', 22 January 2010, p. 15.</ref> As of 2008, there were approximately 7.6 million Mahjong players in Japan and an estimated 8,900 Mahjong parlors did \u00a5300 billion in sales.<ref>Matsutani, Minoru, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100615i1.html Mah-jongg ancient, progressive]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 15 June 2010, p. 3.</ref> Many devotees there believe the game is losing popularity and have taken efforts to revive it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} There are several [[manga]] and [[anime]] (e.g. [[Saki (manga)|Saki]] and [[Akagi (manga)|Akagi]]) devoted to dramatic and comic situations involving Mahjong.<ref>Schodt, Frederik, ''Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics''. Kodansha, 1986, Chapter 5.</ref> Since the 1980s, hundreds of different [[mahjong video game|Mahjong arcade machines]] in Japanese [[video arcade]]s have been created, including [[Strip poker#Strip variants of other games|strip]] versions. Newer units can connect with other arcade machines across the Internet.\n\n[[Mahjong culture]] is still deeply ingrained in the Chinese community. [[Sam Hui]] wrote [[Cantopop|Cantopop songs]] using Mahjong as their themes, and [[Hong Kong]] movies have often included scenes of Mahjong games. Many gambling movies have been filmed in Hong Kong, and a recent subgenre is the Mahjong movie.\nAlthough the popularity of the game in China is still big, since 1949, Mahjong was frown upon by the government because is seen as a means of [[Gambling in China|gambling]] addiction, an issue that the government always sought to tackle.<ref>{{Cite web|title = China unveils restrictive new video game content guidelines|url = https://www.theburnin.com/lifestyle/china-video-game-censorship/|website = The Burn-In|access-date = 2019-08-05}}</ref>\n\nProlonged playing of Mahjong may trigger [[epilepsy|epileptic seizures]] according to a 2007 study.<ref>{{citation | title = Mah-jong\u2013induced seizures: case reports and review of twenty-three patients | url = http://www.hkmj.org/article_pdfs/hkm0708p314.pdf |author1=Richard S.K.

For example, players will try to find seats with the best [[Feng Shui]] or wear their lucky clothing or trinkets. Some believe that specific pieces (one dot for example) bode bad luck if received in their opening hand<ref>{{cite web|last=Lam|first=Desmond|title=Chinese Gambling Superstitions and Taboos|url=http://www.urbino.net/articles.cfm?specificArticle=Chinese%20Gambling%20Superstitions%20and%20Taboos}}</ref>\n\nMore elaborated superstitions in Mahjong range from those found in the game poker, like not counting one's wins and losses, to the comical, like changing one's undergarments after a loss. As with all superstitions in gaming, none of them have been properly demonstrated as effective, though, for some, the rituals have become an integral part of the game experience and its aesthetics.<ref>{{cite web |title=\u9ebb\u5c06\u4e4b\u8ff7\u4fe1\u6280\u5de7 |trans-title=Superstitious skills of Mahjong |url=http://www.majiangjing.com/mjsh.asp?id=1918 |language=chinese

It is commonly played by four players (with some three-player variations found in [[Japan]], [[South Korea]] and [[Southeast Asia]]). The game and its regional variants are widely played throughout Eastern and South Eastern Asia and have also become popular in Western countries.

Ancient game enjoys continued popularity|url=http://thecourier.com/life-news/2016/06/23/mahjong/|work=The Courier}}</ref> Similar to the Western card game [[rummy]], Mahjong is a [[game of skill]], strategy, and calculation and involves a degree of chance.\n\nThe game is played with a set of 144 [[Mahjong tiles|tiles]] based on [[Chinese characters]] and [[chinese culture|symbols]], although some regional variations may omit some tiles or add unique ones. In most variations, each player begins by receiving 13 tiles. In turn players draw and discard tiles until they complete a legal hand using the 14th drawn tile to form four [[#Melds|melds]] (or sets) and a pair (eye). A player can also win with a small class of special hands. There are fairly standard rules about how a piece is drawn, how a piece is robbed from another player, the use of simples (numbered tiles) and Honors (winds and dragons), the kinds of melds allowed, how to deal the tiles and the order of play. Despite these similarities, there are many regional variations to the rules including rather different scoring systems, criteria for legal winning hands, and even private table rules which distinguish some variations as notably different styles of mahjong.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn Chinese, the game was originally called {{lang|zh|\u9ebb\u96c0}} ({{zh|hp=m\u00e1qu\u00e8}}){{mdash}}meaning [[Old World sparrow|sparrow]]{{mdash}}which is still used in some southern dialects. It is said that the clacking of tiles during shuffling resembles the chattering of sparrows. It has also been suggested that the name came from an evolution of an earlier card game called [[Madiao]] which mahjong tiles were adapted from.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The complete book of Mah-Jongg|last=Millington|first=A.

Its name is similar in other languages, except in [[Thai language|Thai]], where it is called \u0e44\u0e1e\u0e48\u0e19\u0e01\u0e01\u0e23\u0e30\u0e08\u0e2d\u0e01 (''phai nok krachok''), a [[calque]] meaning \"sparrow cards.\"<ref>https://eprints.soas.ac.uk/28815/1/10672983.pdf</ref>\n\n== General rules ==\n[[File:Mahjong tiles on angle.jpg|thumb|A set of Mahjong tiles]]\n\nWhile mahjong itself has many variants, various game rules and mechanics are generally \"universal\".  Variations between mahjong forms rests on which game features are used or not.  Players of one form of mahjong may be able to learn another without too much difficulty, compared to an individual who has never played.\n\n=== Game pieces and accessories ===\n{{Main|Mahjong tiles}}\n\nOld Hong Kong Mahjong is played with a standard set of Mahjong tiles (though cards may be used). Sets often include counters (to keep score), dice (to decide how to deal), and a marker to show who the dealer is and which round is being played. Some sets include racks to hold the tiles, especially if they are larger or smaller than standard tiles or have an odd shape.\n\nA set of Mahjong tiles usually has at least 136 tiles (most commonly 144); however, sets originating from the United States or Southeast Asia will probably have more. Mahjong tiles are split into 3 categories: Suits, Honors, and Bonuses.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n|+ Mahjong tile count per set\n|-\n| colspan=2 |\n!

The suits are bamboos, dots, and characters. There are 4 identical copies of each simples tile totaling 108 simples tiles.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|\n!colspan=9|Numbers\n|-\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!8\n!9\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Simples\n!Dots\n|[[File:MJt1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt7-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt8-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Bamboo\n|[[File:MJs1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs7-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs8-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Characters\n|[[File:MJw1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw7-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw8-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw9-.svg|50px]]\n|}\nThe bamboo suit is also known as \"sticks\" or \"bams\" suit; the first tile usually has a bird (traditionally, a peacock or sparrow) instead of a single bamboo. The dots suit is also known as the \"wheels\", \"circles\", \"balls\", \"stones\", '\"marbles\" or \"coins\" suit. The characters suit is also known as the \"cracks\" or \"numbers\" suit since the top characters are numbers in the Chinese orthography, and the bottom characters (in [[traditional Chinese characters]]) are the Chinese orthography of \"ten thousand\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://files.righto.com/chart.html |title=Mah Jongg Tiles and Names |author=Shirriff, Ken |publisher=righto.com |accessdate=24 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Honors tiles ====\nThere are two different sets of Honors tiles: Winds and Dragons. The Winds are East, South, West, and North. In Mahjong, East (not North) is the beginning. The Dragons are Red, Green, and White. The white dragon has a blue or black frame on the face of the piece or in some sets is entirely blank and are typically known as \u767d\u677f (b\u00e1ib\u0103n) \"whiteboard\". These tiles have no numerical sequence like the simples (for example the bamboo pieces number 1 to 9). Like the simples, there are four identical copies of each Honors tile, for a total of 28 Honors tiles.\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Winds\n!East\n!South\n!West\n!North\n|-\n|[[File:MJf1-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJf2-.svg|50px]]||[[File:MJf3-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJf4-.svg|50px]]\n|}\n|width=\"50%\"|\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Dragons\n!Red\n!Green\n!White\n|-\n|[[File:MJd1-.svg|50px]] ||[[File:MJd2-.svg|50px]]||[[File:MJd3-.svg|50px]]\n|}\n|}\n\n==== Bonus tiles ====\nThere are two sets of Bonus tiles: Flowers and Seasons. The flower and season tiles play a unique role in the mechanics of the game. When drawn, the Bonus tile is not added into a player's hand but are instead set aside and kept near the player's other tiles for scoring purposes should they win the hand, and an extra tile is drawn in replacement of the Bonus tile.\n\nIn addition, unlike the Simple and Honors tiles, there is only a single tile of each Bonus tile, so there are a total of four flower and four season tiles in the set. The tiles have a different artistic rendering of a specific type of flower or season.\n\n{| width=\"100%\" border=\"0\"\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|width=\"50%\"|\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Flowers\n! No !!

There is no relation between the bonus tile \"bamboo\" flower and the bamboo suit of simple tiles (ex. 2 bamboo). In traditional Chinese culture, the [[Four Gentlemen]] are the plum (winter), orchid (spring), bamboo (summer), and chrysanthemum (autumn) which are regarded as the representative plants of those seasons, but people regard it as plum blossom (spring), orchid (summer), chrysanthemum (autumn) and bamboo (winter) now.\n\n=== Choosing table positions and first dealer ===\n[[File:Chinese dice.jpg|thumb|Chinese dice]]\nThe dealer is chosen by various means. For example, each player throws dice with the highest count taking the dealer position, second-highest taking south etc. Or one player may place one tile of each wind face down and shuffle them. Each player randomly select one of these tiles and these tiles dictate their wind position. Each player sits down at their respective position (called the wind position) at the table in positions of an inverted compass: East is dealer, the right of the dealer is South, across is West, and the left is North. The order of play is traditionally counter-clockwise.\n\n=== Hands, rounds, and matches ===\n[[File:Tion-Mahjong.JPG|thumb|right|Cubic dealer and prevailing wind marker.]]\nA match consists of four rounds, each representing a \"prevailing wind,\" starting with East. Once the first round is completed, a second round begins with South as the prevailing wind, and so on. Wind position is significant in that it affects the scoring of the game. A Mahjong set with Winds in play will usually include a separate prevailing wind marker (typically a die marked with the Wind characters in a holder).\n\nIn each round at least four hands are played, with each player taking the position of dealer. In the first hand of each round, Player 1 (winner of the dice toss) is East and therefore dealer. In the second hand, Player 2 takes the East position, shifting the seat winds amongst the players counterclockwise (though players do not physically move their chairs). This continues until all four players have been East (dealer). A marker is used to mark which player is East and often the round number. (In sets with racks, a rack may be marked differently to denote the dealer.)\n\nWhenever a player in the East position (dealer) wins a hand, or if there is no winner (a draw or \"goulash hand\"), an extra hand is played with the same seating positions and prevailing wind as in the previous hand. This means that a match may potentially have no limit to the number of hands played (though some players will set a limit of three consecutive hands allowed with the same seat positions and prevailing wind).\n\nExample of games:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Example of a standard 16 hand game with two extra hands played<br/>(per no-winner-hand (goulash) and per east winning hand)\n!

By convention all players should participate in shuffling using both hands moving the pieces around the table rigorously and loudly for a lengthy period. Tiles may get flipped up during this process and players should flip them facing down as soon as possible to avoid identifying the location of the revealed tiles.\n\n====Stacking tiles====\n\nEach player then stacks a row of 18 tiles, two tiles high in front of them (for a total of 36 tiles). Players then push each side of their stack together to form a square wall.\n\n[[File:Mahjong table.svg|thumb|right|upright=2|Walls with slight diagonal offset and player positions marked with cardinal directions, including the dealer (E), along with counting order]]\nRegular players usually place their stacks in a slightly diagonal position (about 20 to 30 degrees anti-clockwise); the right end of their stack is pushed slightly further in to the centre of the table to meet almost the middle of the stack of the player on the right. This creates a smaller square wall the length of about half of each stack, with walls extended away from each corner of the square. The diagonally positioned stacks and a smaller square creates a bigger space for players' tiles and also makes an ergonomic position for drawing tiles from the stack.\n\n====Drawing tiles====\n\nThe dealer throws three dice in the square wall and sums up the total. Counting anti-clockwise so that the dealer is 1 (or 5, 9, 13, 17), so that south (player to the right) is 2 (or 6, 10, 14, 18), etc., a player's quarter of the wall is chosen. Some house rules may use only two dice but have double throws to increase randomness. In the case of double throws, the player of the chosen wall makes the second throw.\n\nUsing the same total on the dice (or the total of the two throws), the player whose wall is chosen then counts the stacks of tiles from right to left. (For double throws, the count may extend to the left side player's stack.) This determines the location where the 'deck' of tiles is cut. Starting from the left of the stacks counted, the dealer draws four tiles for himself, and players in anti-clockwise order draw blocks of four tiles until all players have 12 tiles, so that the stacks decrease clockwise. Each player then draws one last tile to make a 13-tile hand.\n\nDealing does not have to be strictly this way and may be done quite differently based on house rules. Tiles may flip over when being dealt and players should agree in advance on how to deal with the problem. Solutions include having the dealer penalised points, shuffling the turned over piece back into the wall somehow, allowing the player who the tiles were dealt to take the piece or not (meaning the dealer must take it as his/her 14th piece) or other house rules.\n\nEach player now sets aside any Flowers or Seasons they may have drawn and takes turns to draw replacement piece(s) from the wall in the anti-clockwise direction. If a player gets any Flowers or Seasons tiles in the replacement draw, the players must wait for the next turn to draw replacement tiles.\n\n[[File:Mahjong 13th piece draw.svg|thumb|left|While drawing the 13th piece to complete the initial hand, the dealer (E) will typically also draw a 14th piece (both highlighted in blue) to initiate the game.]]\n\n====Game play starts====\nThe dealer draws a piece from the wall in clockwise direction, adding it to their hand. Typically, this draw is performed during the initial deal to speed up play. If this does not complete a legal hand, the dealer then discards a piece (throwing it into the middle of the wall with no particular order in mind).\n\n=== Rules ===\n[[File:Lanzhou-019.JPG|right|thumb|Local play on the street in [[Lanzhou]] ]]\n\nEach player in turn, in counterclockwise direction, draws a tile from the wall; as long as the tile drawn is not one of the Bonus tiles, the player proceeds to discard a tile (either the tile just drawn, or a tile in the hand) to maintain a hand of 13. The discarded tile is thrown into the centre and, if desired, the player announces out loud what the piece is. The other players have an opportunity to seize the discarded tile; if no one takes it, the turn continues to the next player. Play continues this way until one player has a legal winning hand and calls out \"Mahjong\" while revealing their hand.\n\nThere are four different ways that regular order of play can be interrupted:\n#A Bonus tile (Flower or Season) is drawn\n#A meld (Pong, Kong, or Chow) is made from a discard\n#Going Mahjong (declaring a winning hand)\n#Robbing a Kong\n\nDuring play, each player's hand should always be 13 tiles (meaning in each turn a tile must be picked up and another discarded). The count of 13 tiles do not include any Bonus tiles (Flowers and Seasons), which are set to the side, nor does it include the fourth added piece of a Kong. If a player is seen to have fewer or more than 13 tiles in their hand outside of their turn they are penalised.\n\n==== Legal hand ====\nA winning hand consists of 14 tiles. Since players always have 13 tiles in their hand during play, they must win by either drawing a piece from the wall that completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning from the wall\") or claiming a discard from another player which completes a 14-tile hand (\"winning by discard\"). The winning hand is made of four ''melds'' (a specific pattern of three pieces) and the ''eyes'' (a pair of identical pieces). The exceptions to this rule are the special hands listed below.\n\nMost players play with a table minimum, meaning a winning hand must score a minimum number of points (which can be seen in the scoring section). In Hong Kong Mahjong the most common point set is three but can be higher or lower depending on house rules.\n\n==== Melds ====\n'''Melds''' are groups of tiles within the player's hand, consisting of either a ''Pong'' (three identical tiles), a ''Kong'' (four identical tiles), a ''Chow'' (three Simple tiles all of the same suit, in numerical sequence), or ''Eyes'' (two identical tiles needed in a winning hand). Melds may be formed by drawing a tile from the wall, or by seizing another player's discard. There are rules governing which player has priority for a discard, and whether the meld should be exposed (displayed to all players) or remain concealed, depending on the manner in which the meld is formed.\n\n* '''Pongs''' are a set of three identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Stone]]\n\n[[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]] [[File:MJf2-.svg|25px|South Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]]\n\nYou may form a Pong with any Simple or Honors tile. Bonus tiles (Flowers or Seasons) cannot be used to form a Pong because they are set aside and there are not three identical bonus tiles in the set. The tiles must be identical (you cannot mix suits). A Pong may either be concealed (formed by drawing tiles) or exposed (formed by seizing another player's discard).\n* '''Kong''' is a complete set of four identical tiles. For example:\n\n[[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]]\n\n[[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]]\n\nConsider a Kong the same as a Pong with an additional tile to make a complete set of four. There are three ways to form a Kong.\n:# ''Concealed Kong'' \u2013 If a player holds three matching tiles (concealed Pong) and upon drawing a tile completes a set of four they may declare a Kong. They do so by revealing the meld and placing two pieces in the middle face up and two pieces on the ends face down.\n:# ''Exposed Kong'' \u2013 If a player can use a discarded tile to complete three matching tiles (concealed Pong) in their hand, he can take the piece and reveal an \"exposed kong\" or \"melded kong\". The player reveals his three pieces face up and places the stolen discard on top of the middle tile, or face down next to the three other face up pieces.\n:# ''Exposed Kong from Exposed Pong'' \u2013 If a player already has a melded Pong and then later in the game draws the fourth piece from the wall, he may announce (then or later in the game) a Kong by placing the fourth tile on top of the middle piece of the melded Pong, or all four tiles placed face up in a row. If a Pong has been melded a player cannot steal the 4th piece if another player discards it, it must be drawn.\n\nWhenever a Kong is formed, that player must draw an extra tile from the end of the wall and then discard a tile. The fourth piece of a Kong is not considered as one of the 13 tiles a player must always have in their hand. A Kong may not be formed from Bonus tiles (Flowers/Seasons), since the set does not include four identical tiles. Kongs are worth collecting to score more points and deprive opponents of the opportunity to obtain specific tiles.\n* '''Chow''' is a meld of three suited tiles in sequence. For example:\n\n[[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8-.svg|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt6-.svg|25px|6 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]]\n\nThe meld must be in absolute numerical sequence and all in the same suit. Players cannot skip numbers or meld from the 8 or 9 to 1 or 2. Honors tiles cannot be used to make Chows because they have no numerical value, and Bonus tiles (Flowers and Seasons) also cannot be used to make a Chow.\n\nA player can steal a discard to form a Chow only from the player whose turn was immediately before theirs; however, a player forming a Chow from a seized piece has the lowest priority for that tile. Any other player who needs that tile to make a Pong, make a Kong, or to win may seize that piece instead. Like the Pong, the Chow is either concealed (formed by drawing tiles) or exposed (formed by seizing the prior player's discard).\n* '''Eyes''' (also known as a pair) are two identical tiles which are an essential part of a legal winning hand. A piece cannot be stolen (melded) to form a pair of eyes unless the player simultaneously completes a legal winning hand.<ref>Lo, Amy (2001). ''The Book of Mahjong: An Illustrated Guide''. North Clarendon, VT: [[Tuttle Publishing|Tuttle]], p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-8048-3302-8}}.</ref>\n\nFor example:\n\n[[File:MJf4-.svg|25px|North Wind]] [[File:MJf4-.svg|25px|North Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]]\n\n[[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs5-.svg|25px|5 Bamboo]]\n\n[[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]]\n\n[[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]]\n\n==== Interruption of play ====\nThe regular anti-clockwise order of turns may be interrupted for four events:\n\n===== 1. Flower or Season =====\nWhenever a player draws a flower or season, it is announced and then placed to the side (it is not considered a part of the 13-tile hand, but in the event that player wins, he may earn bonus points for them) and the last tile of the wall is drawn as a replacement tile so that the player has the 14 pieces needed before their discard. This may happen successively in a player's turn.\n\n===== 2. Melding another player's discard =====\nWhen a player discards a tile, other players may steal the tile to complete a meld. Stealing tiles has both advantages (quickly forming a winning hand and scoring extra points) and disadvantages (being forced to reveal part of one's hand to other players and not being able to change the meld once declared).\n\nWhen a meld (''Pong'', ''Kong,'' or ''Chow'') is declared through a discard, the player must state the type of meld to be declared and expose the meld by placing the three (or four) tiles face up. The player must then discard a tile, and play continues to the right. If the player who melds a discard is not directly after the discarder (in order of play), one or two players will essentially miss their turn as play continues anti-clockwise from the player who declared the meld.\n\nIf multiple players call for a discarded tile, priority for the discard depends on the declared action of the player stealing the discard.\n\n* # Highest priority goes to the player who needs the discarded tile to win the hand. A player may take the tile to win the hand from any other player.\n\n* # Next priority goes to the player who declares a ''Pong'' or ''Kong'' using the discard. A player who calls for a ''Pong'' or ''Kong'' may take the discard from any other player. Only one player can be in this position because there are only four of any tile in a Mahjong set.\n\n* # Last priority goes to the player who declares a Chow using the discard. Players may only call for a ''Chow'' from the discard of the player immediately prior to them, unless the tile is the final one required to complete the hand.\n\n===== 3. Winning a hand =====\nThe act of winning a hand interrupts play to assess the validity of the hand won.  Upon confirmation, the player is awarded the hand's value per the specific game's rule.\n\n======From a discard======\nIf at any point in the game a player can use another player's discard to complete a legal hand (and with the agreed minimum points), they declare a win and reveal their winning hand. This ends the hand, and scoring commences. If more than one player can use a discard to win the hand, multiple ways can handle the situation based on agreed table rules: Either the players count the points they would win with the discard and the winner is the one with the higher score, the winner is simply the player closest to the discarder in order of turn, or multiple players may be granted the win simultaneously.\n\n======From the wall======\nAlternatively, a player may also win by drawing a tile that completes a legal hand. This is called \"winning from the wall\". In Hong Kong mahjong, winning from the wall doubles the number of base points each loser must pay.\n\n======False Mahjong======\nTechnically, the declaration for winning a hand may be done at anytime.  However, the player must have a complete and legal hand.  Otherwise, the win declaration is penalized.  The penalty depends on table rules. The player may forfeit points to the other players. Another potential penalty is the player who called out the false mahjong must play the rest of the hand with their tiles face up on the table so other players can see them (open hand).  Some methods apply the penalty at the end of the entire game.  Again, the table rules dictate the enforcement of the penalty.\n\n===== 4. Robbing a Kong =====\nA rarely occurring and high-scoring feature of Hong Kong Mahjong is a move called robbing the Kong. If a player declares a Kong (either by melding it or adding a fourth piece to a Pong to form a Kong or declaring a concealed Kong) but another player can use that piece to complete a hand, the completing player takes priority to go Mahjong (win the hand) and may steal that piece from the player who intended to declare the Kong.\n\n==== Examples of winning hands ====\nBelow are two examples of winning hands. A winning hand must consist of four melds (Pongs, Kongs, or Chows) and a pair (eyes) and must also score the agreed table minimum.\n\n: [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] \u2013 [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] \u2013 [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]]\n''Hand formed with four Pongs and the eyes (pair) of East wind. Only bamboo is used (no other simples), scoring extra points (clean hand). No chows are used (an all Pong/Kong hand scores extra points).''\n\n: [[File:MJt1-.svg|25px|1 Circle]] [[File:MJt2-.svg|25px|2 Circle]] [[File:MJt3-.svg|25px|3 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt4-.svg|25px|4 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt6-.svg|25px|6 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] [[File:MJt7-.svg|25px|7 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] \u2013 [[File:MJt8-.svg|25px|8 Circle]] [[File:MJt8-.svg|25px|8 Circle]]\n''A high-scoring hand formed using only circles, known as a pure hand. Hand is made of Chows, Pongs and the eyes of circles.''\n\nMost players include table variations in their games, of which some non-standard are included. The hands of ''seven different pairs'' and ''13 orphans'' are examples which do not have four melds and the eyes. They are described in more detail below.\n\n==== Repeated hands ====\n\nIf the dealer wins the hand, he will remain the dealer and an extra hand is played in addition to the minimum 16 hands in a match.\n\nAn extra hand is also played if there is no winner by the time all the tiles in the wall have been drawn. When there is no winner it is known as a \"goulash hand\". Depending on table rules, the winner of the next game may take an agreed number of points from each player, carrying over the points from the non-winning hand to the winning one. If there are two or three goulash hands in a row then the winner would collect a considerable number of points from each player on top of their scoring hand. Because extra hands may be played every time a dealer wins or if there is a goulash hand, a match of 16 hands can easily become a match of 20 or even much more.\n\nAs table rules add a large amount of flexibility for players, they can choose to disregard the rule of extra hands and pass on the dealership regardless of who wins or if it results in a goulash hand. This puts a maximum estimated limit on the game duration and provides some amount of predictability.\n\n====Rhythm of play====\nPlayers may agree on table rules if the pace of the game is brisk or leisurely. For brisk games players may agree that a couple seconds after a discard are allowed for a \"window of opportunity\" before the next player picks up from the wall. Usually it is agreed once the next player has waited the duration of the \"window of opportunity\" and draws a tile from the wall, the previous discard is lost and cannot be claimed.\n\n=== Scoring ===\n{{Main|Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules}}\n\nOld Hong Kong scoring is relatively simple. There is only one winner (or if there is a draw the hand is replayed). The winner must have a legal hand that meets the minimum faan points agreed to in advance (not including any bonus points). Only the winner scores, the other players pay the winner various sums. After each hand ends, the winner counts all of his or her faan points.\n* faan points depend on:\n** the composition of the entire hand\n** how the hand was won\n** bonus tiles\n** special patterns\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum faan value agreed in advance (often 3). Bonus tiles and a few other elements are not included in the minimum faan value a player needs to form a legal winning hand. (i.e. in a three faan minimum game, if a player has two faan points and one bonus point, the player has not met the proper requirements to win and will need to gain another faan point before calling mahjong. Though the bonus points cannot be included in the minimum points needed to win, they are included in the overall score after a player wins\n* The other players do not score their hand. Once the winner has added his or her points (faan points plus bonus points) they must be converted into base points (the chart is below). These base points represent how much the opponents pay to the winner\n* Players then pay the winner (in money or when not gambling with \"chips or points\") based on three factors:\n** the base points (faan points and bonus points converted into a payment unit)\n** if the player won from the wall (doubles the points)\n** if the player was the dealer (doubles the points)\n\n==== Concealed vs. revealed meld and hand====\n\nA concealed meld is one that contains no tiles stolen from another players discard. A concealed hand is one made up of only concealed melds. Many variations distinguish between a concealed hand (winning from the wall) and a semi concealed hand (the last tile is a stolen discard). In most mahjong variations having a concealed hand can be valuable in scoring. Hong Kong mahjong doesn't award concealed melds/hands as generously as others. Concealed hands only the case with a few limit hands or half-limit hands (thirteen orphans, heavenly gates, four concealed pongs) as well as a complete hand (seven pairs) and over several melds (three concealed pongs).\n\n{|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|+Meld summary\n|-\n! rowspan=2 | Meld Type !! rowspan=2 | Quantity !! colspan=3 | Eligible tiles !! colspan=2 | When completed by ...\n|-\n!

How points are reckoned is agreed by players beforehand. For example, they can keep a tally, exchange chips or pay one another with money. The faan value of a hand is converted into base points which are then used to calculate the points the losers pay the winner. The table is progressive, doubling the number of base points when reaching a certain faan point target. The following is the Old Hong Kong simplified table, for other tables see [[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|+ Base points (Old Hong Kong Simplified) \n! faan points !!

If a player has 3 faan then his hand is worth one base point. A winning hand with 9 faan is worth four base points. Losing players must give the winning player the value of these base points. The following special cases result in doubled base points:\n* If the winner wins from the wall his base points are doubled\n* If the hand was won by discard, the discarder doubles the amount he owes the winner\n* If the winner is east all losers double the basepoints\n* If east player is a losing player he pays double the points to the winner.\n\nIf two of these criteria apply to any player, he must double and then redouble the points owed to the winner.\n\n===== Examples =====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ \n!Hand !!

These are exceptional hands, difficult to obtain and are very valuable in point scoring. As many table rules put a limit on the number of points a winners hand can score, full limit hands score that maximum. Table rules dictate if these rare and special hands are allowed, which ones, and the limit for scoring. A common scoring limit is 64 points, which is the highest base points doubled twice. A winner receives the scoring limit from each player without any doubling.\n\nSome limit hands by necessity must be completely concealed (not discards used) or semi-concealed (the only discard used is the one needed to go mahjong). This includes the 13 orphans, 4 concealed pongs, heavenly hand and earthly hand. It is usually expected that the heavenly gates hand be concealed or semi-concealed. As for the dragon limit hands and the great winds, table rules dictate if the hand must be concealed or not. Some table rules claim that a semi-concealed hand (winning from a discard) scores a half-limit.\n\nSome groups also play with the \"great Flowers\" rule. If a player picks up all four Flowers and all four Seasons during their hand, they instantly win the hand and receive the maximum points from all of the players. This is exceptionally rare.\n\nIn all the hands that require pongs, each pong can be replaced by the corresponding kong.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Limit Hands (Maximum number of fan agreed)\n! width=10% | Hand !! width=90% | Explanation with example\n|-\n!

In mainland China alone, there are over thirty variants.<ref name=\"Games and Culture\">{{cite arxiv |last1=Wang |first1=Xianwen |last2=Mao |first2=Wenli |last3=Liu |first3=Chen |title=Games and Culture: Using Online-gaming Data to Cluster Chinese Regional Cultures |ref=Games and Culture|eprint=1310.0621 |class=cs.CY |year=2013 }}</ref> Many variations today differ only by scoring:\n\n* '''Chinese classical Mahjong''' is the oldest surviving variety of Mahjong and was the version introduced to America in the 1920s under various names. It has a small, loyal following in the West, although few play it in Asia. All players score and it is possible to score higher than the winner.\n* '''Hong Kong Mahjong''' or '''Cantonese Mahjong''' is a more common form of Mahjong, differing in minor scoring details from the Chinese Classical variety. It does not allow multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''[[Competition Mahjong scoring rules|Competition Mahjong]]''' is an international standard founded by All-China Sports Federation in July 1998 that some Mahjong societies have adopted for competition play and in some cases for all play.\n* '''Sichuan Mahjong''' is a growing variety, particularly in southern China, disallowing chi melds, and using only the suited tiles. Play continues until a loser is decided or a draw. It can be played very quickly.\n* '''Wuhan Mahjong''' is growing rapidly and become popular in southern China. It is different from other parts of China such that it has a tile that can be used as everything called Laizi ({{lang|zh|\u8d56\u5b50}}), and the player has to have a set of special two tiles, namely two, five, eight, as prerequisite for winning. Another variation has become the new trend, and is called {{lang|zh|\u7ea2\u4e2d\u8d56\u5b50\u6760}}. Special tiles need to be discarded.\n* '''Changsha Mahjong''' is widely played in [[Hunan]] Province. Like Wuhan Mahjong, players need to obtain special Jong consisting of only tiles of two, five or eight. Changsha Mahjong forbids using winds and some special tiles, those tiles are first drawn out from the table when playing. Winners each round get a special drawing session for bonuses, usually doubling the score.\n* '''Tianjin Mahjong''' using normally seven jokers, with special scoring such as ''joker-free'', ''joker-waiting-pair'', ''catch-5'', ''dragon'', ''joker-suited-dragon''.\n* '''Shenyang Mahjong''' using 13 hands in a game, and Shenyang Mahjong has a really fast speed on playing, which allegedly might be said in some regard to perhaps match the personality of north-east people in China. Also in Shenyang Mahjong, the player must to have Bamboos, Characters, Circles and number one or nine in his hand. In addition, the players have to Pong before they Chow, so there is no chance to win even if some players win at the first time they have their hands in hand.\n* '''Taiwanese Mahjong''' is the variety prevalent in Taiwan and involves hands of sixteen tiles (as opposed to the thirteen-tile hands in other versions), features bonuses for dealers and recurring dealerships, and allows multiple players to win from a single discard.\n* '''Filipino Mahjong''', sixteen tile hands. Certain tiles can be wild. Honors are treated as bonuses.\n* '''Fujian Mahjong''', thirteen tile hands. Certain tiles can be wild. No dragons. Winds are treated as bonuses.\n* '''Taiyuan Lisi Mahjong''', or ''Lisi'' (Raise 4; {{lang|zh|[[:zh:\u592a\u539f\u7acb\u56db\u9ebb\u5c06]]}}), the players must win with the first four blocks drawn which are placed separately in front of other. These four blocks cannot be touched until the player has a ready hand.\n* '''[[Singaporean mahjong|Singaporean-Malaysian Mahjong]]''' are two similar variants with much in common with Hong Kong mahjong. Unique elements of Singaporean-Malaysian Mahjong are the use of four animal bonus tiles (cat, mouse, cockerel, and centipede) as well as certain alternatives in the scoring rules, which allow payouts midway through the game if certain conditions (such as a ''kong'') are met. Melds may also be presented in a form different to most other variations.\n* '''South African Mahjong''' is a variant of Cantonese Mahjong. It is very similar in terms of game play and follows most of the rules and regulations of Cantonese Mahjong. However, there are some minor differences in scoring, e.g. the limit on the maximum points a hand can be rewarded is three or four ''fan'' depending on the ''house'' rules. A chicken hand (gai wu) is normally considered a value hand. Depending on the ''house'' rules ''Flowers'' may also be used to boost scoring.\n* '''Thai Mahjong''' has eight specialized jokers with eight extra flowers and eight animals for a total of 168 tiles.\n* '''Vietnamese Mahjong''' has the same eight specialized jokers but with only eight different extra flowers for a total of 160 tiles. Modern variant triplicates or quadruplicates the jokers for a total of 176 or 184 tiles.\n* '''Japanese classical Mahjong''' is still used in tournaments. It is closer to the Chinese classical scoring system but only the winner scores. \n* '''[[Japanese Mahjong]]''' is a standardized form of Mahjong in Japan and is also found prevalently in video games. In addition to scoring changes, the rules of ''[[Japanese Mahjong#R\u012bchi|r\u012bchi]]'' (ready hand) and ''[[Japanese Mahjong scoring rules#Dora|dora]]'' (bonus tiles) are unique highlights of this variant. In addition, tile discards are specifically arranged in front of each player by discard order, to take discarded tiles into account during play. Some rules replace some number 5 tiles with red tiles so that they can eventually get more value.<!--A standard rule set for Japanese mahjong was designed in 2008 by the European Mahjong Association,<ref>[http://gamenoodle.blogspot.com/2012/09/mahjongs.html European Mahjong Association]</ref> in cooperation with the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, in order to organize the first European Riichi Mahjong Championship in Hanover, Germany, June 2008. Danish player Thomas Kragh was the winner.<ref>[http://www.mahjongnews.com/en/index.php/ec-riichi/54-ec-2008/104-rmc2008.html]</ref>-->\n* '''Korean Mahjong''' is unique in many ways and is an excellent version for three players. One suit is omitted completely (usually the Bamboo set or 2\u20138 of bamboo) as well as the Seasons. The scoring is simpler and the play is faster. No melded chows are allowed and concealed hands are common. Riichi (much like its Japanese cousin) is an integral part of the game as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:korean-overview|title=Korean Mahjong Rules - Mahjong Wiki (\u9ebb\u5c06\u7ef4\u57fa)|website=mahjong.wikidot.com}}</ref>\n* '''Pussers bones''' is a fast-moving variant developed by sailors in the [[Royal Australian Navy]]. It uses an alternative vocabulary, such as ''Eddie'', ''Sammy'', ''Wally'', and ''Normie'', instead of ''East'', ''South'', ''West'', and ''North'' respectively.\n* '''Western classical Mahjong''' is a descendant of the version of Mahjong introduced by Babcock to America in the 1920s. Today, this term largely refers to the \"[[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base|Wright-Patterson]]\" rules, used in the U.S. military, and other similar American-made variants that are closer to the Babcock rules.\n* '''[[American mahjong|American Mahjong]]''' is a form of Mahjong standardized by the National Mah Jongg League<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmahjonggleague.org |title=National Mahjjong League |publisher=Nationalmahjonggleague.org |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> and the American Mah-Jongg Association.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amja.net/|title=The American Mah-Jongg Association \u2013 news, products and tournaments \u2013 Join us for our next American Mah-Jongg tournament or cruise!.}}</ref> It uses joker tiles, the Charleston, plus melds of five or more tiles, treats bonus tiles as Honors, and eschews the Chow and the notion of a standard hand. Legal hands are changed annually. Purists claim that this makes American Mahjong a separate game. In addition, the NMJL and AMJA variations, which have minor scoring differences, are commonly referred to as ''Mahjongg'' or ''mah-jongg'' (with 2 Gs, often hyphenated).\n\n'''[[Three player mahjong|Three-player Mahjong]]''' (or 3-''ka'') is a simplified three-person Mahjong that involves hands of 13 tiles (with a total of 84 tiles on the table) and may use jokers depending on the variation. Any rule set can be adapted for three players; however, this is far more common and accepted in Japan, Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. It usually eliminates one suit entirely, or tiles 2\u20138 in one suit leaving only the terminals. It needs fewer people to start a game and the turnaround time of a game is short\u2014hence, it is considered a fast game. In some versions there is a jackpot for winning in which whoever accumulates a point of 10 is considered to hit the jackpot or whoever scores three hidden hands first. The Malaysian and Korean versions drop one wind and may include a seat dragon.<ref>The Mahjong Wiki.[http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:three-player Three-player mahjong].

The edges are raised to prevent tiles from sliding off and the surface is covered in felt to limit wear on the tiles. Automatic dealing tables, often used for high stakes playing and tournaments, are able to shuffle tiles, build walls, and randomize dice. It is an elaborate device built into a table which uses two alternating sets of tiles. It prepares one wall while the players play one hand. After the hand is finished the tiles are dropped into the table and a new wall raises upwards. In theory the table should avoid cheating (by stacking the deck and or using loaded dice).\n\n====Tiles====\nThe following chart shows the most generic set of tiles \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=2|\n!colspan=11|Numbers\n|-\n!1\n!2\n!3\n!4\n!5\n!6\n!7\n!colspan=2|8\n!colspan=2|9\n|-\n!rowspan=3|Suits\n!Dots\n|[[File:MJt1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJt7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJt8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJt9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Bamboo\n|[[File:MJs1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJs7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJs8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJs9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!Characters\n|[[File:MJw1-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw2-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw4-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw5-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw6-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJw7-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJw8-.svg|50px]]\n|colspan=2|[[File:MJw9-.svg|50px]]\n|-\n!colspan=2 rowspan=4|Honors/Bonus\n!colspan=4|Winds\n!colspan=3|Dragons\n!colspan=4|Bonus\n|-\n!East\n!South\n!West\n!North\n!Red\n!Green\n!White\n!colspan=2|Seasons\n!colspan=2|Flowers\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf1-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf2-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf3-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJf4-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd1-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd2-.svg|50px]]\n|rowspan=2|[[File:MJd3-.svg|50px]]\n|[[File:MJh1-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh2-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh5-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh6-.svg|25px]]\n|-\n|[[File:MJh3-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh4-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh7-.svg|25px]]\n|[[File:MJh8-.svg|25px]]\n|}\n\nThere are variations that feature specific use of tiles. Some three-player versions remove the North Wind and one Chinese provincial version has no Honors. Korean Mahjong removes the bamboo suit or at least its numbers 2\u20138 so that terminals can be used. Japanese Mahjong rarely uses Flowers or Seasons. The Seasons are removed in Korean Mahjong, while many Southeast Asian sets have more flower series.\n\n==== Wild cards and jokers ====\n\nSome mahjong variants accept wildcard tiles. The wildcard tiles are decided at the beginning of the game by choosing one random tile. The wild card could be the immediately following tile on the wall, after distributing tiles to all players, or it could also be separately decided by a dice throw. Wildcard tiles can't be discarded and can only replace tiles in Chows. Wildcard tiles cannot replace tiles in Pongs and Kongs. For example, if a character 4 is chosen, then character 4 and the next sequential tile, character 5, can be used as wild cards in this round. (When the wildcard indicator is chosen and exposed, only 3 tiles remain of the same denomination, so the next tile in the suit will also be used as a wildcard, adding to 7 wildcard tiles for 4 players.) Also, if a tile numbered 9 is the indicator, the suits circle back to 1, after 9. Thus, the number 9 and 1 are wild cards.\n\nAlso, if the chosen tile is not in the suited tiles, the wild cards are decided in rules:\n[[File:Joker-vietnammj.JPG|right|thumb|Top eight are Vietnamese jokers. Bottom four are Chinese.]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Wild card tile chosen !! Another wildcard\n|-\n| East || South\n|-\n| South || West\n|-\n| West || North\n|-\n| North || East\n|-\n| Red Dragon || Green Dragon\n|-\n| Green Dragon || White Dragon\n|-\n| White Dragon || Red Dragon\n|}\n\nThe bonus tiles are not available for wild cards.\n\nA feature of several variations of Mahjong, most notably in American mahjong, is the notion of some number of Joker tiles. They may be used as a wild card: a substitute for any tile in a hand, or, in some variations, only tiles in melds. Another variation is that the Joker tile may ''not'' be used for melding. Depending on the variation, a player may replace a Joker tile that is part of an exposed meld belonging to any player with the tile it represents.\n\nRules governing discarding Joker tiles also exist; some variations permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of any tile, and others only permit the Joker tile to take on the identity of the previously discarded tile (or the absence of a tile, if it is the first discard).\n\nJoker tiles may or may not affect scoring, depending on the variation. Some special hands may require the use of Joker tiles (for example, to represent a \"fifth tile\" of a certain suited or honor tile).\n\nIn American Mahjong, it is illegal to pass Jokers during the Charleston.\n\n===== Flowers =====\nJapanese rule sets discourage the use of Flowers and Seasons. Korean rules and three-player Mahjong in the Korean/Japanese tradition use only Flowers. In Singapore and Malaysia an extra set of bonus tiles of four animals are used. The rule set includes a unique function in that players who get two specific animals get a one-time immediate payout from all players. In Taiwanese Mahjong, getting all eight Flowers and Seasons constitutes an automatic win of the hand and specific payout from all players.\n\nFour of the flower tiles represent the [[Four Gentlemen|four noble plants]] of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] reckoning:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc22 }}[[Prunus mume|plum]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc23 }}[[orchid]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc25 }}[[chrysanthemum]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc24 }}[[bamboo]].\n\n[[File:MJh5-.svg|50px|Plum]] [[File:MJh6-.svg|50px|Orchid]] [[File:MJh7-.svg|50px|Chrysanthemum]] [[File:MJh8-.svg|50px|Bamboo]]\n\nThe other 4 flower tiles (or season tiles) represent Seasons:\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc26 }} [[spring (season)|spring]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc27 }} [[summer]],\n* {{hide in print|\ud83c\udc28 }} [[autumn]],\n* and{{hide in print| \ud83c\udc29 }}[[winter]].\n\n[[File:MJh1-.svg|50px|Spring]] [[File:MJh2-.svg|50px|Summer]] [[File:MJh3-.svg|50px|Autumn]] [[File:MJh4-.svg|50px|Winter]]\n\nThese animal tiles are used in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and local variations. They represent the [[cat]], [[mouse]], [[rooster]] and [[centipede]]. Like flower tiles, they also function as bonus tiles. However, as they have no corresponding seat position, any player who draws one of these gets a bonus point.\n\n[[File:MJat1-.svg|50px|Cat]] [[File:MJat2-.svg|50px|Mouse]] [[File:MJat3-.svg|50px|Rooster]] [[File:MJat4-.svg|50px|Centipede]]\n\n===== Walls =====\nAll tiles are placed face down and shuffled. Each player then stacks a row of tiles two tiles high in front of him, the length of the row depending on the number of tiles in use:\n* 136 tiles: 17 stacks for each player\n** Suits of circles, bamboos, and characters + winds + dragons\n* 144 tiles: 18 stacks for each player\n* 148 tiles: 19 stacks for dealer and player opposite, 18 for rest\n* 152 tiles: 19 stacks for each player\n\n====Dice, markers, and counting pieces====\n[[File:Mahjong fiches.jpg|thumb|right|Mahjong counting sticks: Left are Chinese while the right are Japanese]]\nDepending on the variation, two or three [[dice]] are usually used to decide what part of the wall to start dealing from. They are six-sided dice, traditionally but not necessarily Chinese dice with red one and four pips.\n\nThe dealer marker is a round or square object that the dealer places to the side to remind players who the dealer is. The wind marker may be used which indicates the current prevailing wind. In some cases the dealer marker and the wind marker are represented by one large marker, usually a small wheel where one can swivel the outer circle to indicate the prevailing wind (which the dealer holds onto), a cube with the four winds placed onto four of the sides which can be placed in a hollow square (the dealer holds onto it), or a cylinder locked into frame which can be rolled to expose the wind on the top. Japanese mahjong, especially in a gambling environment, may optionally use four yakitori markers to indicate which players have not won a hand yet and has to pay a penalty.\n\nThere are a variety of counting pieces used in different countries. They range from Chinese or Japanese counting sticks (thin sticks with various dots on them to represent various points), [[jeton]]s, [[play money]], paper and pencil, or various apps on touchscreen devices used to calculate and keep scores.\n\n=== Rules ===\nJapanese and Korean Mahjong have some special rules. A player cannot win by a discard if that player had already discarded that piece, where players' discards are kept in neat rows in front of them. Players may declare ready, meaning that they need one tile to win, cannot change their hand and win extra points if they win. Some rules may replace some of the number 5 tiles with red tiles, as they can earn more points. Korean Mahjong does not allow melded (stolen) chows.\nTaiwanese Mahjong adds three tiles to a hand requiring a 5th set to be formed, making a clean hand or all Pong hand very difficult to procure.\nAmerican Mahjong has distinctive game mechanics and the article on [[American mahjong|American Mahjong]] details these. Some differences include many special patterns, a different scoring system and the use of jokers and five-of-a-kind.\n\n==== Charleston ====\nIn the American variations it is required that, before each hand begins, a Charleston be enacted. In the first exchange, three tiles are passed to the player on one's right; in the next exchange, the tiles are passed to the player opposite, followed by three tiles passed to the left. If all players are in agreement, a second Charleston is performed; however, any player may decide to stop passing after the first Charleston is complete. The Charleston is followed by an optional pass to the player across of one, two, or three tiles. The Charleston, a distinctive feature of American Mahjong, may have been borrowed from card games such as [[Hearts (card game)|Hearts]].\n\n=== Hands ===\nMany variations have specific hands, some of which are common while some are optional depending on regions and players. One example is the Pure Green hand made of chows or Pongs using 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 of bamboo and green dragon.\n\n==== Ready hands ====\nWhen a hand is one tile short of winning (for example: [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs2-.svg|25px|2 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs3-.svg|25px|3 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs7-.svg|25px|7 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs8-.svg|25px|8 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]] [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]], waiting for: [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]], [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]], or [[File:MJd2-.svg|25px|Green Dragon]], as [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] can be the eyes), the hand is said to be a ready hand, or more figuratively, \"on the pot\". The player holding a ready hand is said to be ''waiting'' for certain tiles. It is common to be waiting for two or three tiles, and some variations award points for a hand that is waiting for one tile. In 13-tile Mahjong, the largest number of tiles for which a player can wait is 13 (the ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'', or ''13 orphans'', a nonstandard special hand). Ready hands must be declared in some variations of Mahjong, while other variations prohibit the same.\n\nSome variations of Mahjong, most notably Japanese and Korean ones, allow a player to declare {{nihongo||\u7acb\u76f4|r\u012bchi|sometimes known as ''reach'', as it is phonetically similar}}. A declaration of ''r\u012bchi'' is a promise that any tile drawn by the player is immediately discarded unless it constitutes a win. Standard requirements for ''r\u012bchi'' are that the hand be ''closed'' or have no melds declared (other than a concealed Kong) and that players already have points for declaration of ''r\u012bchi''. A player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and wins usually receives a point bonus for their hand directly, and a player who won with ''r\u012bchi'' also has the advantage to open the inner {{nihongo||\u30c9\u30e9|dora|from \"dra\"gon}} which leads to higher possibilities to match such a card, thus has more chance to grant additional bonus. However, a player who declares ''r\u012bchi'' and loses is usually penalised in some fashion. Declaring a nonexistent ''r\u012bchi'' is also penalised in some way.\n\nIn some variations, a situation in which all four players declare a ''r\u012bchi'' is an automatic drawn game, as it reduces the game down to pure luck, i.e., who gets their needed tile first.\n\n=== Draws ===\nIf only the dead wall remains (or if no dead wall exists and the wall is depleted) and no one has won, the hand is drawn (\u6d41\u5c40 ''li\u00fa j\u00fa'', \u9ec3\u838a ''hu\u00e1ng zhu\u0101ng'', Japanese \u6d41\u5c40 ''ry\u016bkyoku''), or \"[[goulash]]ed\". A new hand begins, and depending on the variant, the Game Wind may change. For example, in most playing circles in Singapore, if there is at least one Kong when the hand is a draw, the following player of the dealer becomes the next dealer; otherwise, the dealer remains dealer.\n\nJapanese Mahjong has a special rule called {{nihongo||\u4e09\u5bb6\u548c|''sanchah\u014d''}}, which is, if three players claim the same discard in order to win, the hand is drawn. One reason for this is that there are cases in which bars of 1,000 points for declaring ''r\u012bchi'' cannot be divided by three. The rule is treated the same as \"abortive draws\".\n\n==== Abortive draws ====\nIn Japanese Mahjong, rules allow abortive draws to be declared while tiles are still available. They can be declared under the following conditions:\n* {{nihongo||\u4e5d\u7a2e\u4e5d\u724c|Ky\u016bshu Ky\u016bhai}}: On a player's first turn when no meld has been declared yet, if a player has nine different terminal (also known as major<ref>{{cite web|last=Gregory |first=Peter |url=http://mahjongbritishrules.com/scoring/index.html |title=Tile Classification |publisher=Mahjongbritishrules.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>) or honor tiles, the player may declare the hand to be drawn (for example, [[File:MJt1-.svg|25px|1 Circle]] [[File:MJt4-.svg|25px|4 Circle]] [[File:MJt5-.svg|25px|5 Circle]] [[File:MJt9-.svg|25px|9 Circle]] [[File:MJs1-.svg|25px|1 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs4-.svg|25px|4 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs6-.svg|25px|6 Bamboo]] [[File:MJs9-.svg|25px|9 Bamboo]] [[File:MJw1-.svg|25px|1 Character]] [[File:MJf1-.svg|25px|East Wind]] [[File:MJf3-.svg|25px|West Wind]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd1-.svg|25px|Red Dragon]] [[File:MJd3-.svg|25px|White Dragon]], but could also go for the nonstandard ''[[Hong Kong Mahjong scoring rules#Non-standard special hands|thirteen wonders]]'' hand as well).\n* {{nihongo|Four Winds' barrier|\u56db\u98a8\u5b50\u9023\u6253|S\u016bfontsu rent\u0101}}: On the first turn without any meld declarations, if all 4 players discard the same Wind tile, the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo||\u56db\u4eba\u7acb\u76f4|Yonin r\u012bchi}}: If all four players declare ''r\u012bchi'', the hand is drawn.\n* {{nihongo|Four Kongs' abort|\u56db\u69d3\u6563\u4e86|S\u016bkan sanra}}: The hand is drawn when the fourth Kong is declared, unless all four Kongs were declared by a single player. Still, the hand is drawn when another player declares a fifth Kong.\n\n===Scoring===\nScoring in Mahjong involves points, with a monetary value for points agreed upon by players. Although in many variations scoreless hands are possible, many require that hands be of some point value in order to win the hand.\n\nWhile the basic rules are more or less the same throughout Mahjong, the greatest divergence between variations lies in the scoring systems. Like the rules, there is a generalized system of scoring, based on the method of winning and the winning hand, from which Chinese and Japanese base their roots. American Mahjong generally has greatly divergent scoring rules, as well as greatly divergent general rules.\n\nBecause of the large differences between the various systems of scoring (especially for Chinese variants), groups of players will often agree on particular scoring rules before a game.\n\n====Points====\nPoints (terminology of which differs from variation to variation) are obtained by matching the winning hand with different criteria scoring different values. The points obtained may be modified into scores for each player using some (typically [[exponential function|exponential]]) functions. Some criteria may be also in terms of both points and score.\n\nIn many variations the dealer receives no scoring bonus and does not maintain his turn by winning or a dead hand.\n\nIn classical Mahjong all players score points. Points are given for sets and hand composition and winning bonuses, doubled and redoubled for basic patterns. Sometimes a loser may score more points than a winner. Japanese Mahjong has a complex scoring system with several stages of scoring, rules and exceptions, evening out scores and bonus points at the end of a match. Korean Mahjong has a simple scoring system where only winner scores without any form of doubling.\n\nSome variations give points for concealed hands, in which case no melds are made except by winning on a discard.\n\nIn Old Hong Kong Mahjong:\n* Only the winner scores points.\n* Winning hands are scored by totaling the point value of each element in the hand. Points are distinct from the actual payment received from each player.\n* The winner receives points (also known as faan among some players) for:\n** individual melds,\n** the composition of the entire hand,\n** how the hand was won,\n** bonus tiles,\n** special patterns,\n** and a few other special criteria.\n* In order to win, a player needs to have at least the minimum points agreed in advance (often 3).\n* Bonus points are separate from the minimum points a player needs to win.\n* If a player goes Mahjong with a legal and minimum hand, his hand is scored by adding his points and bonus points together.\n* The payment received from each player depends on three factors:\n** the point value of the hand,\n** if the player won from a discard or from the wall, and\n** if the player was the dealer or not.\n\n=== Comparison ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Mahjong Variations\n!

The game is entirely unrelated to mahjong or its variations and is a recent invention. A two player version was published by [[Nintendo]]. The game involves stacking tiles face up in various elaborate patterns and removing uncovered matching tiles at the end of rows.\n\n== Competition ==\n[[File:wk-mahjong2002.jpg|thumb|The top 3 in the [[World Mahjong Championship]] in [[Tokyo]], October 2002. Left: John J. O'Connor (2nd place) In the middle: world champion Mai Hatsune, from Japan Right: Yuichi Ikeya (3rd place)]]\n\nIn 1998, in the interest of dissociating illegal gambling from Mahjong, the [[China State Sports Commission]] published a new set of rules, now generally referred to as Chinese Official rules or International Tournament rules (see [[Guobiao Majiang]]). The principles of the new, wholesome Mahjong are no gambling, no drinking, and no smoking. In international tournaments, players are often grouped in teams to emphasize that Mahjong from now on is considered a sport.\n\nThe new rules are highly pattern-based. The rulebook contains 81 combinations, based on patterns and scoring elements popular in classic and modern regional Chinese variants; some table practices of Japan have also been adopted. Points for flower tiles (each flower is worth one point) may not be added until the player has scored eight points. The winner of a game receives the score from the player who discards the winning tile, plus eight basic points from each player; in the case of ''zimo'' (self-drawn win), he receives the value of this round plus eight points from all players.\n\nThe new rules were first used in an international tournament in [[Tokyo]], where, in 2002, the [[2002 World Championship in Mahjong|first global tournament in Mahjong]] was organized by the Mahjong Museum, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee, and the city council of Ningbo, China. One hundred players participated, mainly from Japan and China, but also from Europe and the United States. Mai Hatsune, from Japan, became the first world champion. The following year saw the first annual China Mahjong Championship, held in Hainan; the next two annual tournaments were held in Hong Kong and Beijing. Most players were Chinese; players from other nations attended as well.\n\nIn 2005, the first [[Open European Mahjong Championship]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mahjongnews.com/oemc2005.htm |title=The Independent Internet Mahjong Newspaper |publisher=Mahjongnews.com |accessdate=7 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012145919/http://mahjongnews.com/oemc2005.htm |archive-date=12 October 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> was held in the Netherlands, with 108 players.

There were 152 participants.\n\nIn 2006, the [[World Mahjong Organization]] (WMO) was founded in [[Beijing]], China, with the cooperation of, amongst others, the Japan Mahjong Organizing Committee (JMOC) and the European Mahjong Association (EMA). This organization held its first [[World Mahjong Championship]] in November 2007 in the Chinese town of [[Chengdu]], attended by 144 participants from all over the world. It was won by Li Li, a Chinese student at [[Tsinghua University]]. The next World Championship took place in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], the Netherlands, 27 to 29 August 2010.\n\nOther major international tournaments include the [[Mahjong International League]]'s [[World Mahjong Sports Games]] and the privately sponsored [[World Series Of Mahjong]].\n\n[[American mahjong]] tournaments are held in virtually every state\u2014the largest is in Las Vegas, Nevada twice a year, and in Atlantic City, New Jersey, by Mah Jongg Madness; and the annual cruise hosted by the National Mah Jongg League and Mah Jongg Madness (MJM). MJM tournaments host between 150 and 500 participants at these larger events; and there are several smaller scale, but equally successful tournaments held annually by other hosts. Prize pools are based on the number participating. Rules are based on the National Mah Jongg League standard rules.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:\u6cad\u967d\u7d19\u724c.png|thumb|Money-suited cards]]\nMahjong is based on draw-and-discard [[card games]] that were popular in 18th and 19th century China, some of which are still popular today.<ref name=Lo>{{cite book|last1=Lo|first1=Andrew|title='China's Passion for Pai: Playing Cards, Dominoes, and Mahjong'.

Each deck is divided into three suits of '''[[Cash (Chinese coin)|Cash]]''' or coins, '''[[String of cash coins (currency unit)|Strings]]''' of cash, and '''[[Myriad]]s''' of strings. There are nine ranks in each suit. In addition, there are three [[Wild card (card games)|wild cards]]: '''Red flower''', '''White flower''', and '''Old thousand'''. Depending on the game, there are multiple copies of each card.\n\nGames scholar [[David Parlett]] has written that the Western card games [[Conquian]] and [[Rummy]] share a common origin with Mahjong.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parlett|first=David|title=The Penguin Book of Card Games|year=1978|isbn=978-0-14-103787-5}}</ref> All these games involve players drawing and discarding tiles or cards to make [[Meld (cards)|melds]]. [[Khanhoo]] is an early example of such a game. The most likely ancestor to Mahjong was ''p\u00e8ngh\u00fa'' ([[:zh:\u78b0\u548c|\u78b0\u548c]]) which was played with 120 or 150 cards.<ref name=Lo/> During the late 19th century, ''p\u00e8ngh\u00fa'' was used interchangeably with ''m\u00e1qu\u00e8'' in both card and tile form.\n\nIt is not known when the conversion from cards to tiles took place precisely but it most likely occurred in the middle of the 19th century. The earliest surviving tile sets date to around 1870 and were acquired in [[Fuzhou]], [[Shanghai]], and [[Ningbo]].<ref name=Lo/><ref name=\"Stanwick1\">{{cite journal|last1=Stanwick|first1=Michael|title=Mahjong(g) Before Mahjong(g): Part 1|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2004|volume=32|issue=4|pages=153\u2013162|ref=Stanwick1}}</ref><ref>Sloper, Tom.

The game itself was banned during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966\u20131976).<ref name=\"Lo\"/> Today, it is a favorite pastime in China<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.winmahjong.com/mahjong-in-china/ |title=Mahjong in China |publisher=Win Mahjong |accessdate=29 December 2014 }}</ref> and other Chinese-speaking communities.\n\n=== Mahjong in the West ===\n[[File:28.779 SL1 s.jpg|thumb|200px|Mahjong tiles of late 19th century, a gift of [[George B.

He did not explain the dialect of the originator or region specific etymology of this information.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Wilkinson, W.H.|title=Chinese Origin Of Playing Cards|journal=The American Anthropologist|year=1895|volume=viii|pages=61\u201378|doi=10.1525/aa.1895.8.1.02a00070|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1448960}}</ref> By 1910, there were written accounts in many languages, including [[French language|French]] and Japanese.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nThe game was imported to the United States in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite news |title=Recalling the Craze for a Game of Chance |first=Steven |last=Heller |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=15 March 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/18/arts/artsspecial/18MAH.html?ex=1285473600&en=37c8a4976aafc929&ei=5087&WT.mc_id=AR-D-I-NYT-MOD-MOD-M143-ROS-0410-L2&WT.mc_ev=click}}</ref> The first Mahjong sets sold in the U.S. were sold by [[Abercrombie & Fitch]] starting in 1920. It became a success in [[Washington, D.C.]], and the co-owner of the company, [[Ezra Fitch]], sent emissaries to Chinese villages to buy every Mahjong set they could find. Abercrombie & Fitch sold a total of 12,000 Mahjong sets.\n\nAlso in 1920, [[Joseph Park Babcock]] published his book ''Rules of Mah-Jongg'', also known as the \"red book\". This was the earliest version of Mahjong known in America. Babcock had learned Mahjong while living in China. His rules simplified the game to make it easier for Americans to take up, and his version was common through the Mahjong fad of the 1920s. Later, when the 1920s fad died out, many of Babcock's simplifications were abandoned.\n\nThe game has taken on a number of trademarked names, such as \"Pung Chow\" and the \"Game of Thousand Intelligences\". Mahjong nights in America often involved dressing and decorating rooms in Chinese style.<ref>[[Bill Bryson]], ''[[Made in America (book)|Made in America]]''. Harper, 1996, ch. 16.</ref> Several hit songs were recorded during the Mahjong fad, most notably \"Since Ma Is Playing Mah Jong\" by [[Eddie Cantor]].<ref name=slope/>\n\nMany variants of Mahjong developed during this period. By the 1930s, many revisions of the rules developed that were substantially different from Babcock's classical version (including some that were considered fundamentals in other variants, such as the notion of a standard hand). The most common form, which eventually became \"American Mahjong\", was most popular among [[American Jews|Jewish]] women.<ref name=slope/> Standardization came with the formation of the National Mah Jongg League (NMJL) in 1937, along with the first American Mahjong rulebook, ''Maajh: The American Version of the Ancient Chinese Game'', written by NMJL's first president and co-founder, Viola L. Cecil.<ref>Tom Sloper, ''The Red Dragon & The West Wind: The Winning Guide to Official Chinese & American Mah-Jongg'', HarperCollins, 2007.''</ref>\n\nMany consider the modern American version a Jewish remake,<ref name=slope>{{cite web |url=http://www.sloperama.com/mjfaq/mjfaq19.html#t |title=Why are so many players of American mah-jongg Jewish? |publisher=Sloperama.com |date= |accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref> as many American Mahjong players are of Jewish descent. The NMJL was founded by Jewish players and is considered a Jewish organization. In 1986, the National Mah Jongg League conducted their first Mah Jongg Cruise Tournament, in conjunction with Mah Jongg Madness. In 2010, this large scale seagoing event hosted its 25th Silver Anniversary Cruise, with players from all over the States and Canada participating.\n\nIn 1999, a second organization was formed, the American Mah Jongg Association. The AMJA currently hosts tournaments all across North America, with their signature event being at the [[Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort]] in [[Atlantic City]], [[New Jersey]] before it went bankrupt and closed on October 10, 2016.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, British author Alan D. Millington revived the Chinese classical game of the 1920s with his book ''The Complete Book of Mah-jongg'' (1977). This handbook includes a formal rules set for the game.\n\n=== Current development ===\n[[File:Schoolkidsmahjong.jpg|thumb|200px|Students in the United States learning how to play Mahjong]]\nThere are many governing bodies which often host exhibition games and tournaments for modern and traditional Mahjong gaming.\n\nMahjong, as of 2010, is the most popular table game in Japan.<ref>Pakarnian, John, \"Game Boy:  Glossary of Japanese Gambling Games\", ''[[Metropolis (free magazine)|Metropolis]]'', 22 January 2010, p. 15.</ref> As of 2008, there were approximately 7.6 million Mahjong players in Japan and an estimated 8,900 Mahjong parlors did \u00a5300 billion in sales.<ref>Matsutani, Minoru, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100615i1.html Mah-jongg ancient, progressive]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 15 June 2010, p. 3.</ref> Many devotees there believe the game is losing popularity and have taken efforts to revive it.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} There are several [[manga]] and [[anime]] (e.g. [[Saki (manga)|Saki]] and [[Akagi (manga)|Akagi]]) devoted to dramatic and comic situations involving Mahjong.<ref>Schodt, Frederik, ''Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics''. Kodansha, 1986, Chapter 5.</ref> Since the 1980s, hundreds of different [[mahjong video game|Mahjong arcade machines]] in Japanese [[video arcade]]s have been created, including [[Strip poker#Strip variants of other games|strip]] versions. Newer units can connect with other arcade machines across the Internet.\n\n[[Mahjong culture]] is still deeply ingrained in the Chinese community. [[Sam Hui]] wrote [[Cantopop|Cantopop songs]] using Mahjong as their themes, and [[Hong Kong]] movies have often included scenes of Mahjong games. Many gambling movies have been filmed in Hong Kong, and a recent subgenre is the Mahjong movie.\nAlthough the popularity of the game in China is still big, since 1949, Mahjong was frown upon by the government because is seen as a means of [[Gambling in China|gambling]] addiction, an issue that the government always sought to tackle.<ref>{{Cite web|title = China unveils restrictive new video game content guidelines|url = https://www.theburnin.com/lifestyle/china-video-game-censorship/|website = The Burn-In|access-date = 2019-08-05}}</ref>\n\nProlonged playing of Mahjong may trigger [[epilepsy|epileptic seizures]] according to a 2007 study.<ref>{{citation | title = Mah-jong\u2013induced seizures: case reports and review of twenty-three patients | url = http://www.hkmj.org/article_pdfs/hkm0708p314.pdf |author1=Richard S.K.

For example, players will try to find seats with the best [[Feng Shui]] or wear their lucky clothing or trinkets. Some believe that specific pieces (one dot for example) bode bad luck if received in their opening hand<ref>{{cite web|last=Lam|first=Desmond|title=Chinese Gambling Superstitions and Taboos|url=http://www.urbino.net/articles.cfm?specificArticle=Chinese%20Gambling%20Superstitions%20and%20Taboos}}</ref>\n\nMore elaborated superstitions in Mahjong range from those found in the game poker, like not counting one's wins and losses, to the comical, like changing one's undergarments after a loss. As with all superstitions in gaming, none of them have been properly demonstrated as effective, though, for some, the rituals have become an integral part of the game experience and its

The film centers on college-bound teen Melanie Porter (Raven-Symon\u00e9), who goes on a road trip to different colleges with her father. The film was released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in the United States on March 7, 2008. The film garnered negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is about Melanie Porter ([[Raven-Symon\u00e9]]), a 17-year-old college-bound girl who is getting ready to graduate from high school and really wants to go to [[Georgetown University]]. However, her father James Porter ([[Martin Lawrence]]), the chief of police in the quiet Chicago suburb where they live, is overprotective of Melanie, and isn't ready for her to leave and study so far away from home. James has other plans for Melanie; he wants her to go to [[Northwestern University]] which is only 28 minutes away from home. James also receives problems from disagreements with his real estate agent wife, Michelle ([[Kym Whitley|Kym E. Whitley]]), the family pig Albert, who continuously annoys him, and his young son Trey (Eshaya Draper), who spends much time with the pig. Melanie gets invited to an interview at Georgetown after a college recruiter saw her performance at a mock trial. Her two best friends, Nancy ([[Brenda Song]]) and Katie ([[Margo Harshman]]), offer to take her on their college road trip to Pittsburgh. Melanie is all set to go with her friends until her father surprises her with his own college road trip to Washington, D.C..\n\nOn their way, Melanie reluctantly visits Northwestern to take a tour. They meet an almost-''too''-happy father and daughter duo, Doug ([[Donny Osmond]]) and Wendy ([[Molly Ephraim]]), who are on their own college road trip. James has planted actors at Northwestern, one screaming at Melanie they lost an eye at Georgetown. Melanie almost falls for it until one of the actors says to her \"Yeah, the chief's a pretty smart guy\", since he never met James.\n\nTheir car soon breaks down and they find Trey in the trunk with Albert and a supply of oxygen. They stop at a hotel (thanks to Albert's navigating), but Albert eats coffee beans and becomes hyperactive, leading to him crashing and ruining a wedding. They run into Doug and Wendy again, who offer James and Melanie a ride since James' car broke down. Later, Melanie and her father ride on a tour bus where they try to work out their differences. At one destination, Nancy and Katie show up and take Melanie to a sorority house. James, due to a misunderstanding, and the owner not letting him in to check on her, sneaks into the house. After hearing that his daughter has faith in him, he decides to leave the next morning. Unfortunately, after Melanie leaves, he gets caught by the owner, brutally tazed, and arrested. James' mother comes to bail him out, and opens up about her own past fears when her son went to the Army, but still believed in her son to go his own path.\n\nJames and Melanie end up forgiving each other at the airport. After dropping off Trey, they skydive to make the interview at Georgetown. Melanie is nervous, but James tells her she can do it and that they didn't come all this way for nothing. She then is accepted into Georgetown, which Wendy is accepted into, too.\n\nIn the end, James copes with letting go and three months later, the Porters invite the Greenhuts to their Thanksgiving dinner. Melanie introduces her boyfriend Tracy (Benjamin Patterson). James accepts this, and Wendy announces her engagement to Scooter ([[Lucas Grabeel]]), a chipper young man who behaves exactly like Doug. This causes Doug to finally snap and attack Scooter.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Raven-Symon\u00e9]] as Melanie Porter, James' daughter and a very bright young girl with aspirations to get into Georgetown.\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Chief James Porter, an Army veteran and police chief of a small Illinois suburb.

The film was released by [[Walt Disney Pictures]] in the United States on March 7, 2008. The film garnered negative reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is about Melanie Porter ([[Raven-Symon\u00e9]]), a 17-year-old college-bound girl who is getting ready to graduate from high school and really wants to go to [[Georgetown University]]. However, her father James Porter ([[Martin Lawrence]]), the chief of police in the quiet Chicago suburb where they live, is overprotective of Melanie, and isn't ready for her to leave and study so far away from home. James has other plans for Melanie; he wants her to go to [[Northwestern University]] which is only 28 minutes away from home.

Melanie gets invited to an interview at Georgetown after a college recruiter saw her performance at a mock trial. Her two best friends, Nancy ([[Brenda Song]]) and Katie ([[Margo Harshman]]), offer to take her on their college road trip to Pittsburgh. Melanie is all set to go with her friends until her father surprises her with his own college road trip to Washington, D.C..\n\nOn their way, Melanie reluctantly visits Northwestern to take a tour. They meet an almost-''too''-happy father and daughter duo, Doug ([[Donny Osmond]]) and Wendy ([[Molly Ephraim]]), who are on their own college road trip. James has planted actors at Northwestern, one screaming at Melanie they lost an eye at Georgetown. Melanie almost falls for it until one of the actors says to her \"Yeah, the chief's a pretty smart guy\", since he never met James.\n\nTheir car soon breaks down and they find Trey in the trunk with Albert and a supply of oxygen. They stop at a hotel (thanks to Albert's navigating), but Albert eats coffee beans and becomes hyperactive, leading to him crashing and ruining a wedding. They run into Doug and Wendy again, who offer James and Melanie a ride since James' car broke down. Later, Melanie and her father ride on a tour bus where they try to work out their differences. At one destination, Nancy and Katie show up and take Melanie to a sorority house. James, due to a misunderstanding, and the owner not letting him in to check on her, sneaks into the house. After hearing that his daughter has faith in him, he decides to leave the next morning. Unfortunately, after Melanie leaves, he gets caught by the owner, brutally tazed, and arrested. James' mother comes to bail him out, and opens up about her own past fears when her son went to the Army, but still believed in her son to go his own path.\n\nJames and Melanie end up forgiving each other at the airport.
