Before the advent of the current cruiserweight class, \"light heavyweight\" and \"cruiserweight\" were sometimes used interchangeably in the United Kingdom.\n\n==Professional boxing==\nThe current weight limit for the division is 200 pounds (14 stone 4 pounds / 90.7&nbsp;kg). When originally established, the weight limit was 190 pounds (13st. 8 lbs. / 86.2&nbsp;kg). The division was established in order to accommodate smaller heavyweight boxers who could not compete with the growing size of boxers in that division. While many great heavyweight champions (such as [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Joe Louis]]) weighed around 190 pounds in their career, during the 1970s it became fairly standard that fit heavyweight boxers weighed at least 210 pounds. It was felt by many boxing authorities that asking men weighing between 176 and 190 pounds to fight these larger men was unfair.\n\nThe WBC was the first boxing organization to recognize the cruiserweight division when it sanctioned a bout between [[Marvin Camel]] and [[Mate Parlov]] on December 8, 1979, for their version of the title. That fight was a draw, but in the rematch in March 1980 Camel won and became the first cruiserweight champion. In 1982 the [[World Boxing Association]] recognized [[Ossie Ocasio]] as their first cruiserweight champion when he defeated South African Robbie Williams (although at that time the WBA called the division \"junior heavyweight\"). The [[International Boxing Federation]] followed suit in 1983 when it matched former WBC champion [[Marvin Camel]] against Rick Sekorski for their inaugural title. Camel won and became the first IBF cruiserweight champion.\n\nSeveral boxers moved up to [[heavyweight]] after winning world titles at cruiserweight. [[Evander Holyfield]] unified the WBA, WBC, and IBF titles to become undisputed champion, the first to do so, and then moved up to the heavyweight division in 1988. The second man to become undisputed champion was [[O\u2019Neil Bell]] in 2006 who was later stripped of the IBF title.\n\nOther notable champions in the division have been [[Bobby Czyz]], [[Dwight Muhammad Qawi]], [[Tomasz Adamek]], [[Virgil Hill]], [[Al Cole]], [[Orlin Norris]], [[James Toney]], [[David Haye]] and [[Oleksandr Usyk]]\n\n[[Johnny Nelson]] and [[Marco Huck]] jointly hold the record for most consecutive title defenses at this division, with both achieving 13 defenses of the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] title.\n\n===Current world champions===\n{{main|List of world cruiserweight boxing champions}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Sanctioning Body\n!Reign Began\n!Champion\n!Record\n!Defenses\n!Beaten opponents\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Association|WBA]] \n|May 31, 2019\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Arsen Goulamirian]]\n|24\u20130\u20130 (16 KO)\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Council|WBC]] \n|\n|{{font color|gray|vacant}}\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|[[International Boxing Federation|IBF]]\n|June 15, 2019\n|{{flagicon|CUB}} [[Yuniel Dorticos]]\n|24\u20131\u20130 (22 KO)\n|0\n|0\n|-\n|[[World Boxing Organization|WBO]]\n|\n|{{font color|gray|vacant}}\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n|}\n\n===Current ''The Ring'' world rankings===\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}.<ref name=ring-cw-ratings>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ringtv.com/ratings/?weightclass=273|title=The Ring ratings: cruiserweight|access-date=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nKeys:\n:{{Color box|gold|C|border=darkgray}} Current ''[[The Ring (magazine)|The Ring]]'' world champion\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Rank\n!Name\n!Record (W\u2013L\u2013D)\n!Title(s)\n|-\n|bgcolor=gold|C\n|{{font color|gray|vacant}}\n|\n|\n|-\n|1\n|{{flagicon|Latvia}} [[Mairis Briedis]]\n|26\u20131 (19 KO)\n|\n|-\n|2\n|{{flagicon|Cuba}} [[Yuniel Dorticos]]\n|24\u20131 (22 KO)\n|[[International Boxing Federation|IBF]]\n|-\n|3\n|{{flagicon|Congo}} [[Ilunga Makabu]]\n|27\u20132 (24 KO)\n| [[World Boxing Council|WBC]]\n|-\n|4\n|{{flagicon|Poland}} [[Krzysztof Glowacki]]\n|31\u20132 (19 KO)\n|\n|-\n|5\n|{{flagicon|South Africa}} [[Kevin Lerena]]\n|25\u20131 (12 KO)\n|\n|-\n|6\n|{{flagicon|USA}} [[Andrew Tabiti]]\n|17\u20131 (13 KO)\n|\n|-\n|7\n|{{flagicon|United Kingdom}} [[Lawrence Okolie]]\n|14\u20130 (11 KO)\n|\n|-\n|8\n|{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Arsen Goulamirian]]\n|26\u20130 (18 KO)\n|[[World Boxing Association|WBA]]\n|-\n|9\n|{{flagicon|South Africa}} [[Thabiso Mchunu]]\n|22\u20135 (13 KO)\n|\n|-\n|10\n|{{flagicon|POL}} Michal Cieslak\n|19\u20131 (13 KO)\n|\n|}\n\n===Longest reigning world cruiserweight champions===\nBelow is a list of '''longest reigning cruiserweight champions''' in boxing measured by the individual's longest reign.

The typical scenario involves a girl desperate for money, so she decides to partake in enjo-k\u014dsai. Only later does she stop when a friend or individual intervenes and informs her of the potential risks and consequences of her behavior. Several examples from films and television series are listed below.\n\n[[Masato Harada]]'s 1997 film ''[[Bounce Ko Gals]]'' follows the story of a Japanese schoolgirl in Tokyo who is convinced to try enjo-k\u014dsai as a way to raise money quickly after being robbed. Harada uses the plot as a metaphor for and critique of Japanese consumerism, in which everything including people becomes a product.\n\nIn [[Hideaki Anno]]'s 1998 movie ''[[Love & Pop]]'', the main character, a 16-year-old high school girl named Hiromi, goes on subsidized dates in order to purchase a ring she adores. Her parents do not pay much attention to her and Hiromi often hangs out with her three closest friends who have been going on subsidized dates. Hiromi follows her friends and begins doing the same. Throughout the movie, they meet with different kinds of men and accompany them in various activities. These activities include having dinner at a restaurant, tasting a man's cooking, singing at a karaoke bar and visiting in a video rental store. Although Hiromi nearly gives in and has sex for the remainder of money needed for the ring, her date gives her a lesson on why she should not do so.\n\nIn the Japanese live action drama series ''GTO'' (''[[Great Teacher Onizuka]]''), a female student named Miyabi, out of boredom and lack of adult supervision at home, pressures her friends, Chikako and Erika, to go on subsidized dates with older men, and to steal their money when the men are in the showers. Chikako accidentally meets their teacher Onizuka on one of these dates. In the hotel room, Chikako insists that Onizuka take a shower. Onizuka realizes the trap, stops Chikako's attempt to escape, and teaches her a lesson why her first sexual experience should come out of love and not have anything to do with money. Incidentally, Onizuka (himself a virgin) learns the same lesson from that very occasion.\n\nConversation over the controversy of enjo-k\u014dsai even finds its way into shows geared toward girls (''[[sh\u014djo]]'') between the ages of 11 and 14 in the form of the highly popular ''[[Gals!|Super Gals!]]'' 2001 anime series. During the first episode of the series, straight A student Aya goes on subsidized dates because she wants to have money and fun like the other girls, but also because her strict parents and schedule do not allow her to have a job.\n\nIn the 1998 anime series ''[[Initial D]]'', highschool student Natsuki Mogi is into enjo-k\u014dsai, going out with a rich older man (\"Papa\") who gives her gifts in exchange. In the anime series ''[[My-HiME]]'', it's believed that a shady girl named [[Nao Yuuki]] is into enjo-k\u014dsai. She does use her computer to arrange dates over the internet, under the name ''Juliet''... but instead of going through them, she uses her child Julia to rob her \"suitors\" and beat them up. It's explained later that Nao does it out of revenge on men and especially thieves, since thieves killed her father and seriously injured Nao's mother leaving her in a coma.\n\nIn the 2018 anime series [[FLCL Progressive]], Aiko is a rent-a-girlfriend for Goro Mouri.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[CBR.com]] |url=https://www.cbr.com/10-things-that-dont-make-sense-about-the-flcl-sequels/ |title=10 Things That Don't Make Sense About the FLCL Sequels |date=14 December 2019 |first=Sean |last=Cubillas |quote=Aiko, for whatever reason, breaks that mold by wearing a few too many hats.

During [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|SCAP]]'s occupation of Japan, the Child Welfare Law was introduced into legislation as a means to protect children from \"lewd behavior\". Many have criticized the law as being too vague to protect Japanese children from sexual abuse and say it does not do enough to keep girls away from sex markets.<ref name=\"cornell\"/>\n\nDuring the 1990s enjo k\u014dsai, as well as other forms of child exploitation, gained national attention in Japan leading to international awareness.<ref name=\"cambridge\">Goodman, Roger. Family and Social Policy in Japan: Anthropological Approaches (Contemporary Japanese Society). Cambridge University Press. 2002.</ref> Due to pressure from outside [[NGO]]s and other industrialized nations, the Tokyo government updated its laws relating to child exploitation. The Law for Punishing Acts Related to Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and for Protecting Children, which prohibited an adult from paying a person under the age of 18 for obscene acts, was passed in 1999.<ref>[http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=9704242116&site=ehost-live Tokyo bill to outlaw sex with youths for money]. ''New York Times''; 4 April 1997, Vol. 146.</ref>\n\nTo combat enjo k\u014dsai and other forms of juvenile misbehavior, many [[prefectures]] have instituted a program of {{nihongo|''hod\u014d''|[[:ja:\u88dc\u5c0e|\u88dc\u5c0e]]||\"guidance\", \"protective custody\"}}. ''Hod\u014din'' are  plain-clothed police officers and volunteers who approach youths who appear to be participating in [[juvenile delinquency]] (out past 11 p.m., under-age smoking, wearing expensive accessories, etc.) and offer guidance against such behavior.  When police consider it necessary, teens are taken to a juvenile center or police station for \"formal guidance\" and entered into a confidential police directory.<ref name=\"cornell\"/> Since enjo k\u014dsai is seen as a moral problem relating to Japanese youth, care is taken not to ostracize the girls but instead give them assistance and advice to steer them away from enjo-k\u014dsai.\n\n== Spread to other countries or districts ==\n=== Taiwan ===\nThe use of the term began to spread to other East Asian places in the late 1990s via media. The idea of compensated dating became popular in Taiwan after the airing of the Japanese ''[[dorama]]'' ''[[God, Please Give Me More Time]]'' ([[Fuji Television|JOCX]]), in which a young woman engages in the activity and suffers social and physical costs. In the end, however, the heroine is able to turn her life around and seems to project a positive image for youth. According to scholar Oi-Wan Lam, Taiwanese teens identified with the love story's plot and the [[subculture]] of the characters. Lam also points to the similarities between Taiwanese and Japanese subcultures, and the notion that enjo-k\u014dsai is not actually an occupation, writing, \"Sex work is not recognized by the society as a form of work\".<ref>Oi-Wan Lam, \"Why Did Enjo K\u014dsai Anchor in Taiwan But Not in Hong Kong? Or the Convergence of \"Enjo\" and \"K\u014dsai\" in Teenage Sex Work.\" Inter-Asia Cultural Studies; August 2003, Vol. 4 Issue 2, p353, 11p.</ref> Due to this recognition, teens in both cultures feel they will not suffer consequences for participating in the activity.\n\nA key difference between enjo-k\u014dsai in Japan and Taiwan is the way in which girls set up dates with clients. While [[telephone clubs]] were the main venues that facilitated enjo-k\u014dsai in Japan, the Internet facilitates meetings between girls and clients in Taiwan. Due to this, there have been attempts by several NGOs and the Taiwanese government to regulate Internet sites. Efforts at regulation are compounded by the fact that NGOs and the Taiwanese government sometimes apply the term enjo-k\u014dsai to mean more than just teenage compensated dating, but also prostitution and Internet pornography sites.\n\n=== South Korea ===\nCompensated dating also happens in [[South Korea]], where the South Korean government considers it a form of prostitution. An annual report by [[ECPAT|ECPAT International]], published in 2004, asserts that 222 girls 18 and younger were arrested for participating in enjo-k\u014dsai in the year 2000.<ref>{{cite news|author=Yoshimi Nagamine|newspaper=The Daily Yomiuri|date=5 May 2004|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/results/docview/docview.do?risb=21_T2500913662&format=GNBFI&sort=BOOLEAN&startDocNo=1&resultsUrlKey=29_T2500913673&cisb=22_T2500913672&treeMax=true&treeWidth=0&csi=145202&docNo=1|title=article|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318065813/http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/results/docview/docview.do?risb=21_T2500913662&format=GNBFI&sort=BOOLEAN&startDocNo=1&resultsUrlKey=29_T2500913673&cisb=22_T2500913672&treeMax=true&treeWidth=0&csi=145202&docNo=1|archivedate=18 March 2009}}</ref> South Korea, similar to Japan, passed a law in 2000 protecting children from exploitation and prostitution. Yet due to the nature of enjo-k\u014dsai, specifically the decision of the girl to participate in the act, the girls who do enjo-k\u014dsai are not protected under the law and are subject to punishment under the law.\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\nAccording to social workers, teenagers as young as 15 advertise themselves as available for \"compensated dating\".<ref name=teen>{{cite news|title=Teen girls sell sex via the internet |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=55133&sid=15810773&con_type=1&d_str=20071015&sear_year=2007 |author=Nickkita Lau |newspaper=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]] |date=15 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311154018/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=55133&sid=15810773&con_type=1&d_str=20071015&sear_year=2007 |archivedate=11 March 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> The practice is becoming more acceptable among Hong Kong teenage girls, who do not think compensated dating is a kind of prostitution.

Some even think they are helping others.<ref name=teen/> The internet allows girls more opportunities to offer to shop, eat out or go to a movie with men in return for payment to fulfill their material needs. However, due to the nature of this practice, sexual intercourse unavoidably happens in many cases. In April 2008, the brutal murder of a 16-year-old girl, Wong Ka-mui, who was taking part in compensated dating, drew attention to the issue.<ref name=fiends>{{cite news|title=Teen escorts risk sex fiends |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&art_id=67897&sid=19575157&con_type=1&d_str=20080630&sear_year=2008 |author=Carol Chung |newspaper=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]] |date=30 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311154038/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&art_id=67897&sid=19575157&con_type=1&d_str=20080630&sear_year=2008 |archivedate=11 March 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n=== United States ===\nWith the economy in recession{{fact|date=November 2019}} and tuition costs rising, many students are heavily in debt.

The individuals are matched online, followed by in-person meetings at a public place, such as a coffee shop.

Throughout the movie, they meet with different kinds of men and accompany them in various activities. These activities include having dinner at a restaurant, tasting a man's cooking, singing at a karaoke bar and visiting in a video rental store. Although Hiromi nearly gives in and has sex for the remainder of money needed for the ring, her date gives her a lesson on why she should not do so.\n\nIn the Japanese live action drama series ''GTO'' (''[[Great Teacher Onizuka]]''), a female student named Miyabi, out of boredom and lack of adult supervision at home, pressures her friends, Chikako and Erika, to go on subsidized dates with older men, and to steal their money when the men are in the showers. Chikako accidentally meets their teacher Onizuka on one of these dates. In the hotel room, Chikako insists that Onizuka take a shower. Onizuka realizes the trap, stops Chikako's attempt to escape, and teaches her a lesson why her first sexual experience should come out of love and not have anything to do with money. Incidentally, Onizuka (himself a virgin) learns the same lesson from that very occasion.\n\nConversation over the controversy of enjo-k\u014dsai even finds its way into shows geared toward girls (''[[sh\u014djo]]'') between the ages of 11 and 14 in the form of the highly popular ''[[Gals!|Super Gals!]]'' 2001 anime series. During the first episode of the series, straight A student Aya goes on subsidized dates because she wants to have money and fun like the other girls, but also because her strict parents and schedule do not allow her to have a job.\n\nIn the 1998 anime series ''[[Initial D]]'', highschool student Natsuki Mogi is into enjo-k\u014dsai, going out with a rich older man (\"Papa\") who gives her gifts in exchange. In the anime series ''[[My-HiME]]'', it's believed that a shady girl named [[Nao Yuuki]] is into enjo-k\u014dsai. She does use her computer to arrange dates over the internet, under the name ''Juliet''... but instead of going through them, she uses her child Julia to rob her \"suitors\" and beat them up. It's explained later that Nao does it out of revenge on men and especially thieves, since thieves killed her father and seriously injured Nao's mother leaving her in a coma.\n\nIn the 2018 anime series [[FLCL Progressive]], Aiko is a rent-a-girlfriend for Goro Mouri.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[CBR.com]] |url=https://www.cbr.com/10-things-that-dont-make-sense-about-the-flcl-sequels/ |title=10 Things That Don't Make Sense About the FLCL Sequels |date=14 December 2019 |first=Sean |last=Cubillas |quote=Aiko, for whatever reason, breaks that mold by wearing a few too many hats.

During [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers|SCAP]]'s occupation of Japan, the Child Welfare Law was introduced into legislation as a means to protect children from \"lewd behavior\". Many have criticized the law as being too vague to protect Japanese children from sexual abuse and say it does not do enough to keep girls away from sex markets.<ref name=\"cornell\"/>\n\nDuring the 1990s enjo k\u014dsai, as well as other forms of child exploitation, gained national attention in Japan leading to international awareness.<ref name=\"cambridge\">Goodman, Roger. Family and Social Policy in Japan: Anthropological Approaches (Contemporary Japanese Society). Cambridge University Press. 2002.</ref> Due to pressure from outside [[NGO]]s and other industrialized nations, the Tokyo government updated its laws relating to child exploitation. The Law for Punishing Acts Related to Child Prostitution and Child Pornography and for Protecting Children, which prohibited an adult from paying a person under the age of 18 for obscene acts, was passed in 1999.<ref>[http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=9704242116&site=ehost-live Tokyo bill to outlaw sex with youths for money]. ''New York Times''; 4 April 1997, Vol. 146.</ref>\n\nTo combat enjo k\u014dsai and other forms of juvenile misbehavior, many [[prefectures]] have instituted a program of {{nihongo|''hod\u014d''|[[:ja:\u88dc\u5c0e|\u88dc\u5c0e]]||\"guidance\", \"protective custody\"}}. ''Hod\u014din'' are  plain-clothed police officers and volunteers who approach youths who appear to be participating in [[juvenile delinquency]] (out past 11 p.m., under-age smoking, wearing expensive accessories, etc.) and offer guidance against such behavior.  When police consider it necessary, teens are taken to a juvenile center or police station for \"formal guidance\" and entered into a confidential police directory.<ref name=\"cornell\"/> Since enjo k\u014dsai is seen as a moral problem relating to Japanese youth, care is taken not to ostracize the girls but instead give them assistance and advice to steer them away from enjo-k\u014dsai.\n\n== Spread to other countries or districts ==\n=== Taiwan ===\nThe use of the term began to spread to other East Asian places in the late 1990s via media. The idea of compensated dating became popular in Taiwan after the airing of the Japanese ''[[dorama]]'' ''[[God, Please Give Me More Time]]'' ([[Fuji Television|JOCX]]), in which a young woman engages in the activity and suffers social and physical costs. In the end, however, the heroine is able to turn her life around and seems to project a positive image for youth. According to scholar Oi-Wan Lam, Taiwanese teens identified with the love story's plot and the [[subculture]] of the characters. Lam also points to the similarities between Taiwanese and Japanese subcultures, and the notion that enjo-k\u014dsai is not actually an occupation, writing, \"Sex work is not recognized by the society as a form of work\".<ref>Oi-Wan Lam, \"Why Did Enjo K\u014dsai Anchor in Taiwan But Not in Hong Kong? Or the Convergence of \"Enjo\" and \"K\u014dsai\" in Teenage Sex Work.\" Inter-Asia Cultural Studies; August 2003, Vol. 4 Issue 2, p353, 11p.</ref> Due to this recognition, teens in both cultures feel they will not suffer consequences for participating in the activity.\n\nA key difference between enjo-k\u014dsai in Japan and Taiwan is the way in which girls set up dates with clients. While [[telephone clubs]] were the main venues that facilitated enjo-k\u014dsai in Japan, the Internet facilitates meetings between girls and clients in Taiwan. Due to this, there have been attempts by several NGOs and the Taiwanese government to regulate Internet sites. Efforts at regulation are compounded by the fact that NGOs and the Taiwanese government sometimes apply the term enjo-k\u014dsai to mean more than just teenage compensated dating, but also prostitution and Internet pornography sites.\n\n=== South Korea ===\nCompensated dating also happens in [[South Korea]], where the South Korean government considers it a form of prostitution. An annual report by [[ECPAT|ECPAT International]], published in 2004, asserts that 222 girls 18 and younger were arrested for participating in enjo-k\u014dsai in the year 2000.<ref>{{cite news|author=Yoshimi Nagamine|newspaper=The Daily Yomiuri|date=5 May 2004|url=http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/results/docview/docview.do?risb=21_T2500913662&format=GNBFI&sort=BOOLEAN&startDocNo=1&resultsUrlKey=29_T2500913673&cisb=22_T2500913672&treeMax=true&treeWidth=0&csi=145202&docNo=1|title=article|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318065813/http://www.lexisnexis.com/us/lnacademic/results/docview/docview.do?risb=21_T2500913662&format=GNBFI&sort=BOOLEAN&startDocNo=1&resultsUrlKey=29_T2500913673&cisb=22_T2500913672&treeMax=true&treeWidth=0&csi=145202&docNo=1|archivedate=18 March 2009}}</ref> South Korea, similar to Japan, passed a law in 2000 protecting children from exploitation and prostitution. Yet due to the nature of enjo-k\u014dsai, specifically the decision of the girl to participate in the act, the girls who do enjo-k\u014dsai are not protected under the law and are subject to punishment under the law.\n\n=== Hong Kong ===\nAccording to social workers, teenagers as young as 15 advertise themselves as available for \"compensated dating\".<ref name=teen>{{cite news|title=Teen girls sell sex via the internet |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=55133&sid=15810773&con_type=1&d_str=20071015&sear_year=2007 |author=Nickkita Lau |newspaper=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]] |date=15 October 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311154018/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&art_id=55133&sid=15810773&con_type=1&d_str=20071015&sear_year=2007 |archivedate=11 March 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> The practice is becoming more acceptable among Hong Kong teenage girls, who do not think compensated dating is a kind of prostitution. Some believe it is different because it does not involve sexual intercourse and they can choose their clients, who range from teenage boys to married men. Some even think they are helping others.<ref name=teen/> The internet allows girls more opportunities to offer to shop, eat out or go to a movie with men in return for payment to fulfill their material needs. However, due to the nature of this practice, sexual intercourse unavoidably happens in many cases. In April 2008, the brutal murder of a 16-year-old girl, Wong Ka-mui, who was taking part in compensated dating, drew attention to the issue.<ref name=fiends>{{cite news|title=Teen escorts risk sex fiends |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&art_id=67897&sid=19575157&con_type=1&d_str=20080630&sear_year=2008 |author=Carol Chung |newspaper=[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]] |date=30 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311154038/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&art_id=67897&sid=19575157&con_type=1&d_str=20080630&sear_year=2008 |archivedate=11 March 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n=== United States ===\nWith the economy in recession{{fact|date=November 2019}} and tuition costs rising, many students are heavily in debt.

According to a report by ''The Huffington Post'' in 2011, the arrangements involve women signing up for free on websites as \"[[Mistress (lover)|sugar baby]]\" candidates, using their college email addresses. Male clients, referred to as \"sugar daddies\", join these websites with paid subscriptions as proof of their financial means. The individuals are matched online, followed by in-person meetings at a public place, such as a coffee shop. Each candidate decides whether the other candidate is suitable, i.e. age, physique, personality etc. If the candidate is desirable, the next date may involve sex. ''The Huffington Post'' reported compensation of about $500 per night.

Initially, there was brutal police repression against protestors claiming that Morales had committed fraud in the elections.  \n\nShortly thereafter, large groups of people that supported Morales went into the streets. Some incidents of vandalism were reported, and a house was torched which belonged to Waldo Albarracin, president of the Universidad Mayor de San Andres, who had long denounced Morales. After more than two weeks of intense protests and corollary suppression by public safety forces, the latter determined that they would stand down. A few days later, and owing to the potential for further confrontation and bloodshed, Bolivian military General Williams Kaliman convinced Morales to resign the presidency to pacify the country. Morales, fearing reprisals, flew first to Mexico and then received a lengthier refuge in Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/world/americas/evo-morales-refugee-argentina.html|title=Evo Morales Lands in Argentina, Where He Will Be Granted Refugee Status}}</ref> \n\nShortly thereafter, Morales's successors, who were also accused of participating in voter fraud, resigned, namely Vice President [[Alvaro Garcia Linera]], President of the Senate [[Adriana Salvatierra]] and President of the Chamber of Deputies [[V\u00edctor Borda]].

Initially, there was brutal police repression against protestors claiming that Morales had committed fraud in the elections.  \n\nShortly thereafter, large groups of people that supported Morales went into the streets. Some incidents of vandalism were reported, and a house was torched which belonged to Waldo Albarracin, president of the Universidad Mayor de San Andres, who had long denounced Morales. After more than two weeks of intense protests and corollary suppression by public safety forces, the latter determined that they would stand down. A few days later, and owing to the potential for further confrontation and bloodshed, Bolivian military General Williams Kaliman convinced Morales to resign the presidency to pacify the country. Morales, fearing reprisals, flew first to Mexico and then received a lengthier refuge in Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/world/americas/evo-morales-refugee-argentina.html|title=Evo Morales Lands in Argentina, Where He Will Be Granted Refugee Status}}</ref> \n\nShortly thereafter, Morales's successors, who were also accused of participating in voter fraud, resigned, namely Vice President [[Alvaro Garcia Linera]], President of the Senate [[Adriana Salvatierra]] and President of the Chamber of Deputies [[V\u00edctor Borda]].
