Also located in the former RM of North Cypress are the Acadia, Fairway and Riverbend [[Hutterite]] [[Hutterite#Colonies|colonies]].

The former RM is set upon rich sandy soil, and is widely known for potatoes which are grown by local farming operations. The former RM is also known for forests of [[spruce]], [[Populus|poplar]] and aspen oak trees, and the Carberry sandhills.

They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill.\n\nThe male's song is a loud gurgle used to declare ownership of territory; western males have a more varied repertoire.\n\nThis little bird is native to Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Their breeding habitat is [[marsh]]es with tall vegetation such as [[cattail]]s across [[North America]]. In the western United States, some birds are permanent residents. Other birds [[bird migration|migrate]] to marshes and salt marshes in the southern United States and [[Mexico]]. their non-breeding range is in the southern United States going into Mexico and their breeding range is in the northeastern United States going into Canada.<ref>Cornell All About Birds. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory</ref>\n\n== Foraging and diet ==\nThese birds forage actively in vegetation close to the water, occasionally flying up to catch [[insect]]s in flight. They mainly eat insects, also [[spider]]s and [[snail]]s. In California, 53 Western Marsh Wren stomachs were examined which showed that the birds consume bugs (29%), caterpillars and chrysalids (17%), beetles (16%), ants and wasps (8%), spiders (5%), carabids and coccinellids  (2%), with various other flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies and unidentifiable insect remains making up over 11 percent.

The back is black with white stripes. They have a dark cap with a white line over the eyes and a short thin bill.\n\nThe male's song is a loud gurgle used to declare ownership of territory; western males have a more varied repertoire.\n\nThis little bird is native to Canada, Mexico, and the United States. Their breeding habitat is [[marsh]]es with tall vegetation such as [[cattail]]s across [[North America]]. In the western United States, some birds are permanent residents. Other birds [[bird migration|migrate]] to marshes and salt marshes in the southern United States and [[Mexico]]. their non-breeding range is in the southern United States going into Mexico and their breeding range is in the northeastern United States going into Canada.<ref>Cornell All About Birds. https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory</ref>\n\n== Foraging and diet ==\nThese birds forage actively in vegetation close to the water, occasionally flying up to catch [[insect]]s in flight. They mainly eat insects, also [[spider]]s and [[snail]]s. In California, 53 Western Marsh Wren stomachs were examined which showed that the birds consume bugs (29%), caterpillars and chrysalids (17%), beetles (16%), ants and wasps (8%), spiders (5%), carabids and coccinellids  (2%), with various other flies, grasshoppers, dragonflies and unidentifiable insect remains making up over 11 percent. Ants and wasps were observed to be mostly eaten in the fall.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Marsh_Wren/lifehistory|title=Marsh Wren|last=|first=|date=|website=All About Birds|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=17 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Beal|first=F.

The male builds many unused nests in his territory.
