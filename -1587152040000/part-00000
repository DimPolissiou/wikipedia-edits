There is also an industrial zone on the southern tip of the city, next to [[Gan Sorek]].\n\n===Old city===\n\nThe old city of Rishon includes the original neighborhoods, some buildings dating back to Rishon's founding in 1881. This quarter is located in the city center, between and around Herzl and Jabotinsky Streets. It includes the following neighborhoods:\nNahalat Yehuda (on the northernmost tip of Rishon); Neve Hillel; Bnot Hayil; Abramovich; Katzenelson; Remez (Giv'at Levinson), on the southwestern tip of old Rishon; Rishonim (Gan Nahum), to the east of Remez\n\n===Shikunei HaMizrah===\n\nThe Eastern Housing Projects ({{lang-he|\u05e9\u05d9\u05db\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d4\u05de\u05d6\u05e8\u05d7}} ''Shikunei HaMizrah'') was Rishon's quick expansion to the east. It is dominated by the housing projects (''shikunim'') there, in the ''Shikunei HaMizrah'' neighborhood itself.  The eastern projects stopped developing when they reached the fences of the [[Tzrifin]] military base.  When and if Tzrifin is sold to private contractors as planned, this quarter is expected to expand significantly with new lucrative housing projects.  Other smaller neighborhoods include Revivim, Kidmat Rishon, Ne'urim, Rambam, Neve Hadarim, [[HaShomer]], Kfar Arye, Mishor HaNof and Kiryat Simha.\n\n===Old industrial zone===\n\nThe industrial zones in Rishon LeZion are called ''Mabat'', an abbreviation for ''Miskhar, Bilui VeTa'asiya'' (Commerce, Pastime and Industry). The northern zone is the oldest and original industrial zone, once full of light industry and glass factories. Today, it is known for its prolific nightlife.\n\n===West Rishon===\n\nWest Rishon LeZion is the conglomeration of the new neighborhoods of the city, built in the 1980s and 90s. The west also has a higher land value because of its relative proximity to the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It includes the entire city west of [[Highway 42 (Israel)|Tzahal Road]]. The quarter includes the new industrial zone (Western ''Mabat''), and a number of residential neighborhoods: Neve Eliyahu (or Ramat Eliyahu), Neot Shikma, Neve Dekalim, Neve Hof (or Pueblo Espa\u00f1ol), Neve Yam, Kiryat Rishon, Kiryat Cramim, Kiryat Ganim, Neot Ashalim, Kiryat Hatanei Pras Nobel (''lit'' Nobel Prize Laureates' Town)\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Beach of RLZ 06.JPG|thumb|300px|Rishon LeZion beach]]\nRishon LeZion is known for its achievements in [[team handball|handball]] and [[chess]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}\nIn handball, Hapoel Rishon LeZion and [[Maccabi Rishon LeZion (handball)|Maccabi Rishon LeZion]] dominate the handball league.

J. Caruso]], written by [[John Glenn (screenwriter)|John Glenn]], Travis Adam Wright, Hillary Seitz and Dan McDermott and stars [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Michelle Monaghan]] and [[Billy Bob Thornton]]. The plot follows two strangers who must go on the run together after receiving a mysterious phone call from an unknown woman who is using [[information and communications technology]] to track them.\n\nThe film was released in traditional theaters and [[IMAX]] theaters on September 26, 2008 and grossed $178 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn January 2009, Jerry Shaw ([[Shia LaBeouf]]) is a [[Stanford University]] dropout who learns his [[identical twin]] brother Ethan, an officer in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], has been killed.  Following the funeral, Jerry is surprised to find {{US$|750000|2008|round=-3|about=yes}} in his bank account and his apartment filled with illicit items.  He receives a phone call from a woman ([[Julianne Moore]]) who warns that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] is about to arrest him and he needs to run.\n\nJerry is caught by the [[FBI]] and interrogated by Supervising Agent Tom Morgan ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]).  While Morgan confers with [[United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations|Air Force OSI]] Special Agent Zoe P\u00e9rez ([[Rosario Dawson]]), the woman on the phone arranges for Jerry's escape and directs him to Rachel Holloman ([[Michelle Monaghan]]), a single mother.  The woman on the phone is coercing Rachel by threatening her son Sam ([[Cameron Boyce]]), who is aboard the ''[[Capitol Limited]]'' en route to the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] with his school band.  The woman on the phone helps the two avoid law enforcement by controlling networked devices, including [[traffic light]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, automated [[crane (machine)|crane]]s, and even [[electric power transmission|power lines]].\n\nMeanwhile, the caller redirects a crystal of explosive [[Cyclohexane|hexamethylene]] to a [[gemcutter]], who cuts it and fixes it into a necklace.  Another man ([[Anthony Azizi]]) steals Sam's trumpet in Chicago and fits the crystal's sonic trigger into the tubing, before forwarding it to Sam in Washington.\n\nAgent Perez is summoned by [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] George Callister ([[Michael Chiklis]]) to be [[read into]] Ethan's job at [[the Pentagon]].  Ethan monitored the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]'s top-secret intelligence-gathering [[supercomputer]], the Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Integration Analyst (ARIIA; {{IPAc-en|\u0251\u02d0r|i\u02d0|\u0259}}).  Callister leaves Perez with [[Major (United States)#Army|Major]] William Bowman ([[Anthony Mackie]]) and ARIIA to investigate Ethan Shaw's death.  Simultaneously, Rachel and Jerry learn that the woman on the phone is actually ARIIA, and that she has \"activated\" them according to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]'s authorization to recruit civilians for the national defense.\n\nPerez and Bowman find evidence that Ethan Shaw hid in ARIIA's chamber and then went to brief Callister.  Afterwards, ARIIA smuggles Jerry and Rachel into her observation theater under the Pentagon.  Both groups learn that after ARIIA's recommendation was ignored and a botched operation in [[Balochistan]] [[blowback (intelligence)|resulted in the deaths]] of U.S. citizens, ARIIA concluded that \"to prevent more bloodshed, the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] must be removed.\"  ARIIA is acting on behalf of \"[[We the People]]\", and cites the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] (\"whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it\").\n\nBelatedly, Jerry learns he has been brought to circumvent [[biometrics|biometric]] locks placed by his twin that prevent ARIIA from bringing into effect Operation Guillotine, a [[military simulation]] of maintaining government after the loss of [[United States presidential line of succession|all presidential successors]].  Because Secretary Callister agreed with ARIIA's abort recommendation regarding Balochistan, he is to be the [[designated survivor]] and new [[president of the United States|president]] after the hexamethylene detonates at the [[State of the Union]] (SOTU).\n\nOne of ARIIA's agents ([[Nick Searcy]]) extracts Rachel from the Pentagon and gives her a dress and the explosive necklace to wear to the SOTU.  Sam's school band has also been redirected to the [[United States Capitol]] to play for the president, bringing the trigger in Sam's trumpet and the explosive together.  Jerry is recaptured by Agent Morgan, who has become convinced of Jerry's innocence.  Elsewhere, Morgan sacrifices himself to stop an armed [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9 Reaper]] sent by ARIIA, but first gives Jerry his weapon and ID with which to gain entrance to the Capitol.  Arriving in the [[United States Capitol#House Chamber|House Chamber]], Jerry fires the handgun in the air to disrupt the concert before being shot and wounded by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]].\n\nSometime later, in April 2009, Callister reports that ARIIA has been decommissioned and recommends against building another; the Shaw twins and Agents Perez and Morgan receive awards for their actions; and Jerry attends Sam's [[birthday party]], earning Rachel's gratitude and a kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Jerry Shaw/Ethan Shaw\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Rachel Holloman, a woman who is being coerced by ARIIA.\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as the voice of the super computer ARIIA, aka the \"unknown woman\".\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Zo\u00eb Perez, an [[United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations|Air Force Office of Special Investigations]] (OSI) Agent.\n* [[Michael Chiklis]] as George Callister, the [[United States of America|US]] [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Major William Bowman\n* [[Ethan Embry]] as Toby Grant, an [[FBI]] agent.\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Tom Morgan, an [[FBI]] agent.\n* [[Anthony Azizi]] as Ranim Khalid\n* [[Cameron Boyce]] as Sam Holloman, Rachel's son.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rosario Dawson receiving a safety briefing from Special Agent Patrick McGee.jpg|thumb|Rosario Dawson receiving a safety briefing from Special Agent Patrick McGee while researching her role as an AFOSI agent.]]\nScreenwriter Dan McDermott wrote the original script for ''Eagle Eye'' based on an idea by [[Steven Spielberg]] who had been inspired by [[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story \"[[All the Troubles of the World]].\"<ref>[http://sundaytimes.lk/081207/TV/sundaytvtimes_06.html \"'Eagle Eye': Action thriller with wonders of technology\"], The Sunday Times</ref> The studio [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] then bought McDermott's script and set up the project to potentially be directed by Spielberg.

J. Caruso]], written by [[John Glenn (screenwriter)|John Glenn]], Travis Adam Wright, Hillary Seitz and Dan McDermott and stars [[Shia LaBeouf]], [[Michelle Monaghan]] and [[Billy Bob Thornton]]. The plot follows two strangers who must go on the run together after receiving a mysterious phone call from an unknown woman who is using [[information and communications technology]] to track them.\n\nThe film was released in traditional theaters and [[IMAX]] theaters on September 26, 2008 and grossed $178 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nIn January 2009, Jerry Shaw ([[Shia LaBeouf]]) is a [[Stanford University]] dropout who learns his [[identical twin]] brother Ethan, an officer in the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]], has been killed. Following the funeral, Jerry is surprised to find {{US$|750000|2008|round=-3|about=yes}} in his bank account and his apartment filled with illicit items.  He receives a phone call from a woman ([[Julianne Moore]]) who warns that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] is about to arrest him and he needs to run.\n\nJerry is caught by the [[FBI]] and interrogated by Supervising Agent Tom Morgan ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]). While Morgan confers with [[United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations|Air Force OSI]] Special Agent Zoe P\u00e9rez ([[Rosario Dawson]]), the woman on the phone arranges for Jerry's escape and directs him to Rachel Holloman ([[Michelle Monaghan]]), a single mother. The woman on the phone is coercing Rachel by threatening her son Sam ([[Cameron Boyce]]), who is aboard the ''[[Capitol Limited]]'' en route to the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts|Kennedy Center]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] with his school band. The woman on the phone helps the two avoid law enforcement by controlling networked devices, including [[traffic light]]s, [[mobile phone]]s, automated [[crane (machine)|crane]]s, and even [[electric power transmission|power lines]].\n\nMeanwhile, the caller redirects a crystal of explosive [[Cyclohexane|hexamethylene]] to a [[gemcutter]], who cuts it and fixes it into a necklace. Another man ([[Anthony Azizi]]) steals Sam's trumpet in Chicago and fits the crystal's sonic trigger into the tubing, before forwarding it to Sam in Washington.\n\nAgent Perez is summoned by [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] George Callister ([[Michael Chiklis]]) to be [[read into]] Ethan's job at [[the Pentagon]]. Ethan monitored the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]]'s top-secret intelligence-gathering [[supercomputer]], the Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Integration Analyst (ARIIA; {{IPAc-en|\u0251\u02d0r|i\u02d0|\u0259}}). Callister leaves Perez with [[Major (United States)#Army|Major]] William Bowman ([[Anthony Mackie]]) and ARIIA to investigate Ethan Shaw's death. Simultaneously, Rachel and Jerry learn that the woman on the phone is actually ARIIA, and that she has \"activated\" them according to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]]'s authorization to recruit civilians for the national defense.\n\nPerez and Bowman find evidence that Ethan Shaw hid in ARIIA's chamber and then went to brief Callister. Afterwards, ARIIA smuggles Jerry and Rachel into her observation theater under the Pentagon. Both groups learn that after ARIIA's recommendation was ignored and a botched operation in [[Balochistan]] [[blowback (intelligence)|resulted in the deaths]] of U.S. citizens, ARIIA concluded that \"to prevent more bloodshed, the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive branch]] must be removed.\" ARIIA is acting on behalf of \"[[We the People]]\", and cites the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] (\"whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it\").\n\nBelatedly, Jerry learns he has been brought to circumvent [[biometrics|biometric]] locks placed by his twin that prevent ARIIA from bringing into effect Operation Guillotine, a [[military simulation]] of maintaining government after the loss of [[United States presidential line of succession|all presidential successors]]. Because Secretary Callister agreed with ARIIA's abort recommendation regarding Balochistan, he is to be the [[designated survivor]] and new [[president of the United States|president]] after the hexamethylene detonates at the [[State of the Union]] (SOTU).\n\nOne of ARIIA's agents ([[Nick Searcy]]) extracts Rachel from the Pentagon and gives her a dress and the explosive necklace to wear to the SOTU.  Sam's school band has also been redirected to the [[United States Capitol]] to play for the president, bringing the trigger in Sam's trumpet and the explosive together. Jerry is recaptured by Agent Morgan, who has become convinced of Jerry's innocence. Elsewhere, Morgan sacrifices himself to stop an armed [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|MQ-9 Reaper]] sent by ARIIA, but first gives Jerry his weapon and ID with which to gain entrance to the Capitol. Arriving in the [[United States Capitol#House Chamber|House Chamber]], Jerry fires the handgun in the air to disrupt the concert before being shot and wounded by the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]]. ARIIA tries to escape by uploading its central core to a satellite, but is stopped when Agent Perez smashes it with a crowbar, stopping ARIIA from escaping to attempt Operation Guillotine again.\n\nSometime later, in April 2009, Callister reports that ARIIA has been decommissioned and recommends against building another; the Shaw twins and Agents Perez and Morgan receive awards for their actions; and Jerry attends Sam's [[birthday party]], earning Rachel's gratitude and a kiss.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Shia LaBeouf]] as Jerry Shaw/Ethan Shaw\n* [[Michelle Monaghan]] as Rachel Holloman, a woman who is being coerced by ARIIA.\n* [[Julianne Moore]] as the voice of the super computer ARIIA, aka the \"unknown woman\".\n* [[Rosario Dawson]] as Zo\u00eb Perez, an [[United States Air Force Office of Special Investigations|Air Force Office of Special Investigations]] (OSI) Agent.\n* [[Michael Chiklis]] as George Callister, the [[United States of America|US]] [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]].\n* [[Anthony Mackie]] as Major William Bowman\n* [[Ethan Embry]] as Toby Grant, an [[FBI]] agent.\n* [[Billy Bob Thornton]] as Tom Morgan, an [[FBI]] agent.\n* [[Anthony Azizi]] as Ranim Khalid\n* [[Cameron Boyce]] as Sam Holloman, Rachel's son.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Rosario Dawson receiving a safety briefing from Special Agent Patrick McGee.jpg|thumb|Rosario Dawson receiving a safety briefing from Special Agent Patrick McGee while researching her role as an AFOSI agent.]]\nScreenwriter Dan McDermott wrote the original script for ''Eagle Eye'' based on an idea by [[Steven Spielberg]] who had been inspired by [[Isaac Asimov]]'s short story \"[[All the Troubles of the World]].\"<ref>[http://sundaytimes.lk/081207/TV/sundaytvtimes_06.html \"'Eagle Eye': Action thriller with wonders of technology\"], The Sunday Times</ref> The studio [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] then bought McDermott's script and set up the project to potentially be directed by Spielberg.

Canada]] (1867\u20131873, 1878\u20131891). The [[Fathers of Confederation|dominant figure]] of [[Canadian Confederation]], he had a political career which spanned almost half a century.\n\nMacdonald was born in [[Scotland]]; when he was a boy his family immigrated to [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] in the Province of [[Upper Canada]] (today in eastern [[Ontario]]). As a lawyer he was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston, which elected him in 1844 to the legislature of the [[Province of Canada]]. By 1857, he had become [[List of Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada|premier]] under the colony's unstable political system.\n\nIn 1864, when no party proved capable of governing for long, Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival, [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], that the parties unite in a [[Great Coalition]] to seek federation and political reform. Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences, which resulted in the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]] and the birth of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867. Macdonald was the first Prime Minister of the new nation, and served 19&nbsp;years; only [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] served longer.\n\nIn 1873, he resigned from office over a scandal in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. However, he was re-elected in 1878, continuing until he died in office in 1891. Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867\u20131942)|Conservative Party]], promoting the protective tariff of the [[National Policy]], and completing the railway. He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from the national government in [[Ottawa]]. His most controversial move was to approve the execution of [[M\u00e9tis in Canada|M\u00e9tis]] leader [[Louis Riel]] for treason in 1885; it alienated many [[French language in Canada|francophones]] from his Conservative Party. He died in 1891, still in office; he is respected today for his key role in the formation of Canada.\n\nHe is criticized for his role in the [[Chinese head tax in Canada|Chinese Head Tax in Canada]] and the [[Pacific Scandal|Canadian Pacific Railway Scandal]]. However, [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of Canada|historical rankings]] have consistently placed Macdonald as one of the highest rated Prime Ministers in Canadian history.<ref name=\"Maclean's\">S.

After Hugh's business ventures left him in debt, the family immigrated to [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], in [[Upper Canada]] (today the southern and eastern portions of Ontario), in 1820, where there were already a number of relatives and connections.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=13}}\n\nThe family initially lived with another, but then resided over a store which Hugh Macdonald ran. Soon after their arrival, John's younger brother James died from a blow to the head by a servant who was supposed to look after the boys. After Hugh's store failed, the family moved to Hay Bay (south of [[Napanee, Ontario]]), west of Kingston, where Hugh unsuccessfully ran another shop. His father, in 1829, was appointed a magistrate for the [[Midland District, Upper Canada|Midland District]].{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=23}} John Macdonald's mother was a lifelong influence on her son, helping him in his difficult first marriage and remaining a force in his life until her 1862 death.{{sfn|Smith|McLeod|1989|p=1}}\n\nJohn initially attended local schools. When he was aged 10, his family scraped together the money to send him to Midland District Grammar School in Kingston.{{sfn|Smith|McLeod|1989|p=1}} Macdonald's formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age at a time when only children from the most prosperous families were able to attend university.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|p=18}} Nevertheless, Macdonald later regretted leaving school when he did, remarking to his secretary [[Joseph Pope (public servant)|Joseph Pope]] that if he had attended university, he might have embarked on a literary career.{{sfn|Pope|1894|p=4}}\n\n==Legal career, 1830\u20131843 ==\n\n===Legal training and early career, 1830\u20131837 ===\nMacdonald's parents decided he should become a lawyer after leaving school.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=19}} As [[Donald Creighton]] (who penned a two-volume biography of Macdonald in the 1950s) wrote, \"law was a broad, well-trodden path to comfort, influence, even to power\".{{sfn|Creighton|1952|p=19}} It was also \"the obvious choice for a boy who seemed as attracted to study as he was uninterested in trade.\"{{sfn|Creighton|1952|p=19}} Besides, Macdonald needed to start earning money immediately to support his family because his father's businesses were again failing. \"I had no boyhood,\" he complained many years later. \"From the age of 15, I began to earn my own living.\"{{sfn|Pope|1894|p=6}}\n\n[[File:Rideau-Street-house01.gif|thumb|A few months after he opened his first law office in 1835, Macdonald moved with his parents and sisters to this {{frac|2|1|2}}-storey stone house on Kingston's Rideau Street.]]\n\nMacdonald travelled by steamboat to Toronto (known until 1834 as [[York, Upper Canada|York]]), where he passed an examination set by [[The Law Society of Upper Canada]], including mathematics, Latin, and history. British North America had no law schools in 1830; students were examined when beginning and ending their tutelage. Between the two examinations, they were apprenticed, or articled to established lawyers.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=19\u201320}} Macdonald began his apprenticeship with George Mackenzie, a prominent young lawyer who was a well-regarded member of Kingston's rising Scottish community. Mackenzie practised corporate law, a lucrative speciality that Macdonald himself would later pursue.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=46\u201347}} Macdonald was a promising student, and in the summer of 1833, managed the Mackenzie office when his employer went on a business trip to Montreal and Quebec in [[Lower Canada]] (today the southern portion of the [[Quebec|province of Quebec]]). Later that year, Macdonald was sent to manage the law office of a Mackenzie cousin who had fallen ill.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nIn August 1834, George Mackenzie died of [[cholera]]. With his supervising lawyer dead, Macdonald remained at the cousin's law office in Hallowell (today [[Picton, Ontario]]). In 1835, Macdonald returned to Kingston, and even though not yet of age nor qualified, began his practice as a lawyer, hoping to gain his former employer's clients.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=32\u201334}} Macdonald's parents and sisters also returned to Kingston, and Hugh Macdonald became a bank clerk.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=38}}\n\nSoon after Macdonald was [[call to the bar|called to the Bar]] in February 1836, he arranged to take in two students; both became, like Macdonald, [[Fathers of Confederation]]. [[Oliver Mowat]] became premier of Ontario, and [[Alexander Campbell (Canadian senator)|Alexander Campbell]] a federal cabinet minister and [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario]].{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=19}} One early client was Eliza Grimason, an Irish immigrant then aged sixteen, who sought advice concerning a shop she and her husband wanted to buy. Grimason would become one of Macdonald's richest and most loyal supporters, and may have also become his lover.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=41}} Macdonald joined many local organisations, seeking to become well known in the town. He also sought out high-profile cases, representing accused child rapist William Brass. Brass was hanged for his crime, but Macdonald attracted positive press comments for the quality of his defence.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|pp=41\u201342}} According to his biographer, [[Richard Gwyn]]:\n\n<blockquote>\nAs a criminal lawyer who took on dramatic cases, Macdonald got himself noticed well beyond the narrow confines of the Kingston business community. He was operating now in the arena where he would spend by far the greatest part of his life&nbsp;\u2013 the court of public opinion. And, while there, he was learning the arts of argument and of persuasion that would serve him all his political life.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=49}}\n</blockquote>\n\n===Professional prominence, 1837\u20131843 ===\nAll male Upper Canadians between 18 and 60&nbsp;years of age were members of the Sedentary Militia, which was called into active duty during the [[Rebellions of 1837]]. Macdonald served as a private in the militia, patrolling the area around Kingston, but the town saw no real action and Macdonald was not called upon to fire on the enemy.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=43}}\n\nAlthough most of the trials resulting from the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] took place in Toronto, Macdonald represented one of the defendants in the one trial to take place in Kingston. All the Kingston defendants were acquitted, and a local paper described Macdonald as \"one of the youngest barristers in the Province <nowiki>[who]</nowiki> is rapidly rising in his profession\".{{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n[[File:Battle of the Windmill.jpg|left|thumb|Battle of the Windmill, near Prescott, Upper Canada, 13 November 1838]]\n\nIn late 1838, Macdonald agreed to advise one of a group of American raiders who had crossed the border to liberate Canada from what they saw as the yoke of British colonial oppression. The inept invaders had been captured after the [[Battle of the Windmill]] (near [[Prescott, Ontario]]), in which 16 Canadians were killed and 60 wounded. Public opinion was inflamed against the prisoners, as they were accused of mutilating the body of a dead Canadian lieutenant. Macdonald biographer Donald Creighton wrote that Kingston was \"mad with grief and rage and horror\" at the allegations. Macdonald could not represent the prisoners, as they were tried by [[court-martial]] and civilian counsel had no standing. At the request of Kingston relatives of Daniel George, paymaster of the ill-fated invasion, Macdonald agreed to advise George, who, like the other prisoners, had to conduct his own defence.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=61\u201363}} George was convicted and hanged.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|p=67}} According to Macdonald biographer Donald Swainson, \"By 1838, Macdonald's position was secure. He was a public figure, a popular young man, and a senior lawyer.\"{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=21}}\n\nMacdonald continued to expand his practice while being appointed director of many companies, mainly in Kingston. Macdonald became both a director of and a lawyer for the new Commercial Bank of the Midland District. Throughout the 1840s, Macdonald invested heavily in real estate, including commercial properties in downtown Toronto.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=58}} Meanwhile, he was suffering from some illness, and in 1841, his father died.

He also suffered what he termed his first downfall, as his supporters, carrying the victorious candidate, accidentally dropped him onto a slushy street.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=59}}\n\nThe [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] had merged Upper and Lower Canada into the [[Province of Canada]] effective in 1841. Kingston became the initial capital of the new province; Upper Canada and Lower Canada became known as Canada West and Canada East.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=22}} In March 1844, Macdonald was asked by local businessmen to stand as Conservative candidate for Kingston in [[List of elections in the Province of Canada#1844|the upcoming legislative election]].{{sfn|Phenix|2006|pp=63\u201364}} Macdonald followed the contemporary custom of supplying the voters with large quantities of alcohol.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=25}} In the era preceding the [[secret ballot]] when votes were publicly declared, Macdonald defeated his opponent, Anthony Manahan, by 275&nbsp;\"shouts\" to 42 when the two-day election concluded on 15 October 1844.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=64}} At that time, the Legislative Assembly met in Montreal. Macdonald was never an orator, and especially disliked the bombastic addresses of the time. Instead, he found a niche in becoming an expert on election law and parliamentary procedure.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=28}}\n\nIn 1844, Isabella fell ill. She recovered, but the illness recurred the following year, and she became an invalid. John Macdonald took his wife to [[Savannah, Georgia]], in the United States in 1845, hoping that the sea air and warmth would cure her ailments. Although John Macdonald was able to return to Canada after six months, Isabella remained in the United States for three years.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=28\u201329}} He visited her again in New York at the end of 1846, and returned several months later when she informed him she was pregnant.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|pp=79\u201383}} In August 1847 their son John Alexander Macdonald Jr. was born in New York, but as Isabella remained ill, relatives cared for the infant.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=30\u201331}}\n\nAlthough he was often absent due to his wife's illness, Macdonald was able to gain professional and political advancement. In 1846, he was made a [[Queen's Counsel]]. The same year, he was offered the non-cabinet post of [[Solicitor General of Canada|Solicitor General]], but declined it. In 1847, the [[Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada|Joint Premier]], [[William Henry Draper (judge)|William Henry Draper]], appointed Macdonald as Receiver General.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=31}} Accepting the government post required Macdonald to give up his law firm income{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=83}} and spend most of his time in Montreal, away from Isabella.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=31}} When elections were held in December 1848 and January 1849, Macdonald was easily reelected for Kingston, but the Conservatives lost seats and were forced to resign when the legislature reconvened in March 1848. Macdonald returned to Kingston when the legislature was not sitting, and Isabella joined him there in June.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=31}} In August, the child John Jr. died suddenly.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=85\u201386}} In March 1850, Isabella Macdonald gave birth to another boy, [[Hugh John Macdonald]], and his father wrote, \"We have got Johnny back again, almost his image.\"{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=37}} Macdonald began to drink heavily around this time, both in public and in private, which Patricia Phenix, who studied Macdonald's private life, attributes to his family troubles.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=107}}\n\nThe Liberals, or [[Clear Grits|Grits]], maintained power in the 1851 election, but soon, they were divided by a parliamentary scandal. In September, the government resigned, and a [[coalition]] government uniting parties from both parts of the province under Sir [[Allan MacNab]] took power. Macdonald did much of the work of putting the government together and served as [[Attorney General]]. The coalition which came to power in 1854 became known as the [[Liberal-Conservative Party|Liberal-Conservatives]] (referred to, for short, as the Conservatives). In 1855, [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]] of Canada East (today Quebec) joined the Cabinet. Until Cartier's 1873 death, he would be Macdonald's political partner. In 1856, MacNab was eased out as premier by Macdonald, who became the leader of the Canada West Conservatives.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=40\u201342}} Though the most powerful man in the government he remained as Attorney General, with Sir [[\u00c9tienne-Paschal Tach\u00e9]] as premier.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=162}}\n\n===Colonial leader, 1858\u20131864 ===\n[[File:John A Macdonald in 1858.jpg|thumb|upright|John A.

Macdonald a widower with a seven-year-old son. Hugh John Macdonald would be principally raised by his paternal aunt and her husband.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=130}}\n\nThe Assembly had voted to move the seat of government permanently to Quebec City. Macdonald had opposed that, and used his power to force the Assembly to reconsider in 1857. Macdonald proposed that [[Queen Victoria]] decide which city should be Canada's capital. Opponents, especially from Canada East, argued that the Queen would not make the decision in isolation; she would be bound to receive informal advice from her Canadian ministers. Nevertheless, Macdonald's scheme was adopted, with Canada East support assured by allowing Quebec City to serve a three-year term as the seat of government before the Assembly moved to the permanent capital. Macdonald privately asked the [[Colonial Office]] to ensure that the Queen would not respond for at least 10 months, or until after the general election.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=248\u2013249}} In February 1858, the Queen's choice was announced, much to the dismay of many legislators from both parts of the province: the isolated Canada West town of [[Ottawa]].{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nOn 28 July 1858, an opposition Canada East member proposed an address to the Queen informing her that Ottawa was an unsuitable place for a national capital. Macdonald's Canada East party members [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] to vote for the address, and the government was defeated. Macdonald resigned, and the Governor General, [[Sir Edmund Walker Head, 8th Baronet|Sir Edmund Walker Head]], invited opposition leader [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]] to form a government. Under the law at that time, Brown and his ministers lost their seats in the Assembly by accepting office, and had to face [[by-election]]s. This gave Macdonald a majority pending the by-elections, and he promptly defeated the government. Head refused Brown's request for a dissolution of the Assembly, and Brown and his ministers resigned. Head then asked Macdonald to form a government. The law allowed anyone who had held a ministerial position within the last thirty days to accept a new position without needing to face a by-election; Macdonald and his ministers accepted new positions, then completed what was dubbed the \"Double Shuffle\" by returning to their old posts.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=175\u2013177}} In an effort to give the appearance of fairness, Head insisted that Cartier be titular premier, with Macdonald as his deputy.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=48}}\n\nIn the late 1850s and early 1860s, Canada enjoyed a period of great prosperity. The railroad and telegraph improved communications. According to Macdonald biographer Richard Gwyn, \"In short, Canadians began to become a single community.\"{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=194\u2013195}} At the same time, the provincial government became increasingly difficult to manage. An act affecting both Canada East and Canada West required a \"double majority\"\u2014a majority of legislators from each of the two sections of the province. This led to increasing deadlock in the Assembly.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=201}} The two sections each elected 65&nbsp;legislators, even though Canada West had a larger population. One of Brown's major demands was \"rep by pop\", that is, representation by population, which would lead to Canada West having more seats, and was bitterly opposed by Canada East.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=49}}\n\nThe [[American Civil War]] led to fears in Canada and in Britain that once the Americans had concluded their internal warfare, they would invade Canada again. Britain asked the Canadians to pay a part of the expense of defence, and a Militia Bill was introduced in the Assembly in 1862. The opposition objected to the expense, and Canada East representatives feared that French-Canadians would have to fight in a British-instigated war. At the time, Macdonald was drinking heavily, and he failed to provide much leadership on behalf of the bill. The government fell over the bill, and the Grits took over under the leadership of [[John Sandfield Macdonald]] (no relation to John A. Macdonald).{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=52\u201353}} John A. Macdonald did not remain out of power long; the parties remained closely matched, with a handful of independents able to destroy any government. The new government fell in May 1863, but Head allowed a new election, which made little change to party strength. In December 1863, Canada West MP [[Albert Norton Richards]] accepted the post of Solicitor-General, and so had to face a by-election. John A. Macdonald campaigned against Richards personally, and Richards was defeated by a Conservative. The switch in seats cost the Grits their majority, and they resigned in March. John A. Macdonald returned to office with Tach\u00e9 as titular premier. The Tach\u00e9-Macdonald government was defeated in June. The parties were deadlocked to such an extent that, according to Swainson, \"It was clear to everybody that the constitution of the Province of Canada was dead\".{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=54\u201355}}\n\n==Confederation of Canada, 1864\u20131867==\n[[File:QuebecConvention1864.jpg|thumb|300px|The Quebec Conference. Macdonald seated, fourth from left]]\nAs his government had fallen again, Macdonald approached the new governor general, [[Charles Monck, 4th Viscount Monck|Lord Monck]], and obtained a [[dissolution of parliament|dissolution]]. Before he could act on it, he was approached by Brown through intermediaries; the Grit leader felt that the crisis gave the parties the opportunity to join together for constitutional reform. Brown had led a parliamentary committee on confederation among the British North American colonies, which had reported back just before the Tach\u00e9-Macdonald government fell.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=286\u2013288}} Brown was more interested in representation by population; Macdonald's priority was a federation that the other colonies could join. The two compromised and agreed that the new government would support the \"federative principle\"\u2014a conveniently elastic phrase. The discussions were not public knowledge and Macdonald stunned the Assembly by announcing that the dissolution was being postponed because of progress in negotiations with Brown\u2014the two men were not only political rivals, but were known to hate each other.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=288\u2013289}}\n\nThe parties resolved their differences, joining in the [[Great Coalition]], with only the [[Parti rouge]] of Canada East, led by [[Jean-Baptiste-\u00c9ric Dorion]], remaining apart. A conference, called by the Colonial Office, was scheduled for 1 September 1864 in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]]; the [[Maritimes]] were to consider [[Maritime Union|a union]]. The Canadians obtained permission to send a delegation\u2014led by Macdonald, Cartier, and Brown\u2014to what became known as the [[Charlottetown Conference]]. At its conclusion, the Maritime delegations expressed a willingness to join a confederation if the details could be worked out.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=63\u201365}}\n\nIn October 1864, delegates for confederation met in Quebec City for the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]], where the [[Quebec Resolutions|Seventy-Two Resolutions]] were agreed to\u2014they would form the basis of Canada's government.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=67\u201369}} The Great Coalition was endangered by Tach\u00e9's 1865 death: Lord Monck asked Macdonald to become premier, but Brown felt that he had as good a claim on the position as his coalition partner. The disagreement was resolved by appointing another compromise candidate to serve as titular premier, [[Narcisse-Fortunat Belleau]].{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=73}}\n\nIn 1865, after lengthy debates, Canada's legislative assembly approved confederation by 91 votes to 33.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=72}} None of the Maritimes, however, had approved the plan. In 1866, Macdonald and his colleagues financed pro-confederation candidates in the [[1866 New Brunswick general election|New Brunswick general election]], resulting in a pro-confederation assembly. Shortly after the election, [[Nova Scotia]]'s premier, [[Charles Tupper]], pushed a pro-confederation resolution through that colony's legislature.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=172}} A final conference, to be held in London, was needed before the British parliament could formalise the union. Maritime delegates left for London in July 1866, but Macdonald, who was drinking heavily again, did not leave until November, angering the Maritimers.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=75}} In December 1866, Macdonald both led the [[London Conference of 1866|London Conference]], winning acclaim for his handling of the discussions, and wooed and won his second wife, [[Agnes Macdonald, 1st Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe|Agnes Bernard]].{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=175}} Bernard was the sister of Macdonald's private secretary, [[Hewitt Bernard]]; the couple first met in Quebec in 1860, but Macdonald had seen and admired her as early as 1856.{{sfn|Smith|McLeod|1989|p=36}} In January 1867, while still in London, he was seriously burned in his hotel room when his candle set fire to the chair he had fallen asleep in, but Macdonald refused to miss any sessions of the conference.

Canada verged on stagnation so many residents emigrated to the United States, where growth was much more rapid. Macdonald's solution was to build the transcontinental railroad to stimulate growth, and to implement a \"National Policy\" of high tariffs that would protect the small Canadian firms from American competition.<ref>Edgar McInnis, ''Canada: A political and social history'' (1982) pp 404\u201310.</ref>\n\n===First majority, 1867\u20131871===\n[[File:Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|thumb|300px|Timeline of the evolution of Canada's boundaries since 1867]]\n\nMacdonald and his government faced immediate problems upon formation of the new country. Much work remained to do in creating a federal government. Nova Scotia was already threatening to withdraw from the union; the Intercolonial Railway, which would both conciliate the Maritimes and bind them closer to the rest of Canada, was not yet built. Anglo-American relations were in a poor state, and Canadian foreign relations were matters handled from London. The withdrawal of the Americans in 1866 from the Reciprocity Treaty had increased tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=80\u201381}} Much of present-day Canada remained outside confederation\u2014in addition to the separate colonies of Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and [[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia]], which remained governed by the British, vast areas in the north and west belonged to the British and to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=81\u201382}} American and British opinion was that the experiment of Confederation would quickly unravel, and the nascent nation absorbed by the United States.{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=3}}\n\nIn August 1867, the new nation's [[1867 Canadian federal election|first general election]] was held; Macdonald's party won easily, with strong support in both large provinces, and a majority from New Brunswick.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|p=2}} Parliament convened in November,{{sfn|Creighton|1955|p=1}} surprisingly without Brown, who was defeated in Ontario and never served as a member of the [[House of Commons of Canada]].{{sfn|Creighton|1955|p=3}} By 1869, Nova Scotia had agreed to remain part of Canada after a promise of better financial terms\u2014the first of many provinces to negotiate concessions from Ottawa.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=84\u201385}} Pressure from London and Ottawa failed to gain the accession of Newfoundland, whose voters rejected a Confederation platform in a general election in October 1869.{{sfn|Waite|1975|p=76}}{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=72}}\n[[File:Macdonald1872.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Macdonald in the 1870s]]\n\nIn 1869, John and Agnes Macdonald had a daughter, Mary.

Immediately upon Confederation, he sent commissioners to London who in due course successfully negotiated the transfer of [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] to Canada.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=85\u201386}} The Hudson's Bay Company received $1,500,000, and retained some trading posts as well as one-twentieth of the best farmland.{{r|esask, Rupert's Land purchase}} Prior to the effective date of acquisition, the Canadian government faced unrest in the [[Red River Colony]] (today southeastern [[Manitoba]], centred on [[Winnipeg]]). The local people, including the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]], were fearful that rule would be imposed on them which did not take into account their interests, and rose in the [[Red River Rebellion]] led by [[Louis Riel]]. Unwilling to pay for a territory in insurrection, Macdonald had troops put down the uprising before 15 July 1870 formal transfer, but as a result of the unrest, the Red River Colony joined Confederation as the province of Manitoba, while the rest of the purchased lands became the [[Northwest Territories|North-West Territories]].{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=80\u201383}} Following the [[North-West Rebellion]] of 1885 Macdonald implemented restrictions upon the movement of indigenous groups, requiring them to receive formal permission from an Indian Department Official in order to go off reserve.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The New Buffalo: The Struggle for Aboriginal Post-Secondary Education in Canada|last = Stonechild|first = Blair|publisher = University of Manitoba Press|year = 2006|isbn = 9780887556937|location = Winnipeg|page = [https://archive.org/details/newbuffalostrugg0000ston/page/19 19]|url = https://archive.org/details/newbuffalostrugg0000ston/page/19}}</ref>\n[[File:Uncle Sam kicked out.png|thumb|250px|\"We don't want you here.\" Annexation to the United States was a political issue in Canada's early days.

There was interest in the United States in bringing about the colony's annexation, and Macdonald wished to ensure his new nation had a Pacific outlet. The colony had an extremely large debt that would have to be assumed should it join Confederation. Negotiations were conducted in 1870, principally during Macdonald's illness and recuperation, with Cartier leading the Canadian delegation. Cartier offered British Columbia a railroad linking it to the eastern provinces within 10 years. The British Columbians, who privately had been prepared to accept far less generous terms, quickly agreed and joined Confederation in 1871.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=91\u201392}} The Canadian Parliament ratified the terms after a debate over the high cost that cabinet member [[Alexander Morris (politician)|Alexander Morris]] described as the worst fight the Conservatives had had since Confederation.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\nThere were continuing disputes with the Americans over deep-sea fishing rights, and in early 1871, an Anglo-American commission was appointed to settle outstanding matters between the British (and Canadians) and the Americans. Canada was hoping to secure compensation for damage done by [[Fenians]] [[Fenian raids|raiding Canada]] from bases in the United States. Macdonald was appointed a British commissioner, a post he was reluctant to accept as he realised Canadian interests might be sacrificed for the mother country. This proved to be the case; Canada received no compensation for the raids and no significant trade advantages in the settlement, which required Canada to open her waters to American fishermen. Macdonald returned home to defend the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] against a political firestorm.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n===Second majority and Pacific Scandal, 1872\u20131873===\nIn the run-up to [[1872 Canadian federal election|the 1872 election]], Macdonald had yet to formulate a railway policy, or to devise the loan guarantees that would be needed to secure the construction. During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as [[Hugh Allan]] and considerable financial discussion took place. Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been debated in Parliament.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\nIn early 1872, Macdonald submitted the treaty for ratification, and it passed the Commons with a majority of 66.{{sfn|Waite|1975|p=97}} The general election was held through late August and early September (future Canadian elections would be conducted, for the most part, on one day). Redistribution had given Ontario increased representation in the House; Macdonald spent much time campaigning in the province, for the most part outside Kingston. Widespread bribery of voters took place throughout Canada, a practice especially effective in the era when votes were publicly declared; in future elections the [[secret ballot]] would be used. Macdonald and the Conservatives saw their majority reduced from 35 to 8.{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=97\u2013100}} The Liberals (as the Grits were coming to be known) did better than the Conservatives in Ontario, forcing the government to rely on the votes of Western and Maritime MPs who did not fully support the party.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=96}}\n\n[[File:Whither are we drifting.png|thumb|250px|\"Whither are we drifting?\" Macdonald is shown triumphant at obtaining a prorogation, but is trampling a weeping Canada and apparently drunk with bottle in pocket in this August 1873 cartoon by [[John Wilson Bengough]].

Macdonald's government awarded the Allan group the charter in late 1872. In 1873, when Parliament opened, Liberal MP [[Lucius Seth Huntington]] charged that government ministers had been bribed with large, undisclosed political contributions to award the charter. Documents soon came to light which substantiated what came to be known as the [[Pacific Scandal]]. The Allan-led financiers, who were secretly backed by the United States's [[Northern Pacific Railway]],{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=200}} had donated $179,000 to the Tory election funds, they had received the charter, and Opposition newspapers began to publish telegrams signed by government ministers requesting large sums from the railway interest at the time the charter was under consideration. Macdonald had taken $45,000 in contributions from the railway interest himself. Substantial sums went to Cartier, who waged an expensive fight to try to retain his seat in [[Montreal East (electoral district)|Montreal East]] (he was defeated, but was subsequently returned for the Manitoba seat of [[Provencher]]). During the campaign Cartier had fallen ill with [[Bright's disease]], which may have been causing his judgment to lapse;{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=97\u2013100}} he died in May 1873 while seeking treatment in London.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=97\u2013100}}\n\nEven before Cartier's death, Macdonald attempted to use delay to extricate the government.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|p=156}} The Opposition responded by leaking documents to friendly newspapers. On 18 July, three papers published a telegram dated August 1872 from Macdonald requesting another $10,000 and promising \"it will be the last time of asking\".{{sfn|Waite|1975|p=103}} Macdonald was able to get a [[prorogation in Canada|prorogation of Parliament]] in August by appointing a [[Royal Commission]] to look into the matter, but when Parliament reconvened in late October, the Liberals, feeling Macdonald could be defeated over the issue, applied immense pressure to wavering members.{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nOn 3 November, Macdonald rose in the Commons to defend the government, and according to his biographer P.B. Waite, gave \"the speech of his life, and, in a sense, for his life\".{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=105\u2013106}} He began his speech at 9&nbsp;p.m., looking frail and ill, an appearance which quickly improved. As he spoke, he consumed glass after glass of gin and water. He denied that there had been a corrupt bargain, and stated that such contributions were common to both political parties. After five hours, Macdonald concluded,\n\n<blockquote>\nI leave it with this House with every confidence. I am equal to either fortune. I can see past the decision of this House either for or against me, but whether it be against me or for me, I know, and it is no vain boast to say so, for even my enemies will admit that I am no boaster, that there does not exist in Canada a man who has given more of his time, more of his heart, more of his wealth, or more of his intellect and power, as it may be, for the good of this Dominion of Canada.{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=105\u2013106}}\n</blockquote>\n\nMacdonald's speech was seen as a personal triumph, but it did little to salvage the fortunes of his government. With eroding support both in the Commons and among the public, Macdonald went to the Governor General, [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]] on 5 November and resigned; Liberal leader [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] became the second Prime Minister of Canada. Following the resignation, Macdonald returned home and told his wife Agnes, \"Well, that's got along with\", and when asked what he meant, told her of his resignation, and stated, \"It's a relief to be out of it.\"{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=102\u2013103}} He is not known to have spoken of the events of the Pacific Scandal again.{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=255}} When Macdonald announced his resignation in the Commons, Conservative and Liberal MPs traded places on the benches of the House of Commons, though one Conservative MP, British Columbia's [[Amor De Cosmos]] remained in his place, thereby joining the Liberals.{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|pp=255\u2013256}}\n\nOn 6 November 1873, Macdonald offered his resignation as party leader to his caucus; it was refused. Mackenzie called [[1874 Canadian federal election|an election]] for January 1874; the Conservatives were reduced to 70&nbsp;seats out of the 206 in the Commons, giving Mackenzie a massive majority.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=180\u2013183}} The Conservatives bested the Liberals only in British Columbia; Mackenzie had called the terms by which the province had joined Confederation \"impossible\".{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=256}} Macdonald was returned in Kingston but was unseated on an election contest when bribery was proven; he won the ensuing by-election by 17&nbsp;votes. According to Swainson, most observers viewed Macdonald as finished in politics, \"a used-up and dishonoured man\".{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=104}}\n\n===Opposition, 1873\u20131878===\nMacdonald was content to lead the Conservatives in a relaxed manner in opposition and await Liberal mistakes. He took long holidays and resumed his law practice, moving his family to Toronto and going into partnership with his son Hugh John.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=105\u2013107}} One mistake that Macdonald believed the Liberals had made was a free-trade agreement with Washington, negotiated in 1874; Macdonald had come to believe that protection was necessary to build Canadian industry.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=184\u2013185}} The [[Panic of 1873]] had led to a worldwide depression; the Liberals found it difficult to finance the railroad in such a climate, and were generally opposed to the line anyway\u2014the slow pace of construction led to British Columbia claims that the agreement under which it had entered Confederation was in jeopardy of being broken.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=108}}\n\nBy 1876, Macdonald and the Conservatives had adopted protection as party policy. This view was widely promoted in speeches at a number of political picnics, held across Ontario during the summer of 1876. Macdonald's proposals struck a chord with the public, and the Conservatives began to win a string of by-elections. By the end of 1876, the Tories had picked up 14&nbsp;seats as a result of by-elections, reducing [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Mackenzie's]] Liberal majority from 70 to 42.{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=121\u2013122}} Despite the success, Macdonald considered retirement, wishing only to reverse the voters' verdict of 1874\u2014he considered [[Charles Tupper]] his heir apparent.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|p=227}}\n[[File:Riding into power.jpg|thumb|In this Bengough cartoon, Macdonald (centre, ankles crossed) rides the elephant of the National Policy into power in the 1878 election, trampling the Liberals underfoot.

Macdonald even campaigned in Quebec, which he had rarely done, leaving speechmaking there to Cartier.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=232\u2013234}} More picnics followed in 1878, promoting proposals which would come to be collectively called the \"[[National Policy]]\": high tariffs, rapid construction of the transcontinental railway (the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] or CPR), rapid agricultural development of the West using the railroad, and policies which would attract immigrants to Canada.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=111}} These picnics allowed Macdonald venues to show off his talents at campaigning, and were often lighthearted\u2014at one, the Tory leader blamed agricultural pests on the Grits, and promised the insects would go away if the Conservatives were elected.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nThe final days of the [[3rd Canadian Parliament]] were marked by explosive conflict, as Macdonald and Tupper alleged that MP and railway financier [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith]] had been allowed to build the [[Pembina, North Dakota|Pembina]] branch of the CPR (connecting to American lines) as a reward for betraying the Conservatives during the Pacific Scandal. The altercation continued even after the Commons had been summoned to the Senate to hear the dissolution read, as Macdonald spoke the final words recorded in the 3rd Parliament: \"That fellow Smith is the biggest liar I ever saw!\"{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=239\u2013240}}\n\n[[1878 Canadian federal election|The election]] was called for 17 September 1878.

In the election, Macdonald was defeated in his riding by [[Alexander Gunn (politician)|Alexander Gunn]], but the Conservatives swept to victory.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=241\u2013242}} Macdonald remained in the House of Commons, having quickly secured his election for [[Marquette (electoral district)|Marquette]], Manitoba; elections there were held later than in Ontario. His acceptance of office vacated his parliamentary seat, and Macdonald decided to stand for the British Columbia seat of [[Victoria (electoral district)|Victoria]], where the election was to be held on 21 October. Macdonald was duly returned for Victoria,{{r|parl|Bourinot 2008}} although he had never visited either Marquette or Victoria.{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=299}}\n\n===Third and fourth majorities, 1878\u20131887===\n[[File:Sir John Alexander Macdonald Nov 1833 Topley portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Macdonald in November 1883, age 68]]\n\nPart of the National Policy was implemented in the budget presented in February 1879. Under that budget, Canada became a high-tariff nation like the United States and Germany. The tariffs were designed to protect and build Canadian industry\u2014finished textiles received a tariff of 34%, but the machinery to make them entered Canada free.{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=307}} Macdonald continued to fight for higher tariffs for the remainder of his life.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=115-16}}\n\n[[File:Mac steamroller.png|250px|thumb|Macdonald uses his parliamentary majority to roll to victory over Liberal leader [[Edward Blake]] and his party in this 1884 cartoon by [[John Wilson Bengough]]]]\nBy the 1880s, Macdonald was becoming more frail, but he maintained his political acuity. In 1883, he secured the \"Intoxicating Liquors Bill\" which took the regulation system away from the provinces, in part to stymie his foe Premier Mowat. In his own case, Macdonald took better control of his drinking and binges had ended. \"The great drinking-bouts, the gargantuan in sobriety's of his middle years, were dwindling away now into memories.\"<ref>Creighton, ''The Old Chieftain '' 2:345, 347</ref> As the budget moved forward, Macdonald studied the railway issue, and found the picture unexpectedly good. Although little money had been spent on the project under Mackenzie, several hundred miles of track had been built and nearly the entire route surveyed. In 1880, Macdonald found a syndicate, led by [[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen|George Stephen]], willing to undertake the CPR project. Donald Smith (later Lord Strathcona) was a major partner in the syndicate, but because of the ill will between him and the Conservatives, Smith's participation was initially not made public, though it was well-known to Macdonald.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=116\u2013117}} In 1880, the Dominion took over Britain's remaining Arctic territories, which extended Canada to its present-day boundaries, with the exception of Newfoundland, which would not enter Confederation until 1949. Also in 1880, Canada sent its first diplomatic representative abroad, Sir [[Alexander Tilloch Galt|Alexander Galt]] as [[High Commission of Canada to the United Kingdom|High Commissioner to Britain]].{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=123}} With good economic times, Macdonald and the Conservatives were returned with a slightly decreased majority [[1882 Canadian federal election|in 1882]]. Macdonald was returned for the Ontario riding of [[Carleton (Ontario electoral district)|Carleton]].{{sfn|Creighton|1955|p=33}}\n\nThe [[transcontinental railroad]] project was heavily subsidised by the government. The CPR was granted {{convert|25000000|acre|km2 sqmi}} of land along the route of the railroad, and $25,000,000 from the government. In addition, the government was pledged to build $32,000,000 of other railways to support the CPR. The entire project was extremely costly, especially for a nation with only 4.1&nbsp;million people in 1881.{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=149\u2013150}} Between 1880 and 1885, as the railway was slowly built, the CPR repeatedly came close to financial ruin. Not only was the terrain in the [[Rocky Mountains]] difficult, the route north of [[Lake Superior]] proved treacherous, as tracks and engines sank into the [[muskeg]].{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=118\u2013119}} When Canadian guarantees of the CPR's bonds failed to make them salable in a declining economy, Macdonald obtained a loan to the corporation from the Treasury\u2014the bill authorizing it passed the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] just before the firm would have become insolvent.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=370\u2013376}}\n\n[[File:John Wilson Bengough 1885-08-29 A Riel Ugly Position (cropped).jpg|thumb|Protestants demanded Riel be executed; Catholics wanted him to live.

Negotiations between the M\u00e9tis and the Government to settle grievances over land rights proved difficult, Riel had lived in exile in the United States since 1870, he journeyed to Regina with the connivance of Macdonald's government, who believed he would prove a leader they could deal with.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=385\u2013388}} Instead, the M\u00e9tis rose the following year under Riel in the [[North-West Rebellion]]. Macdonald put down the rebellion with militia troops transported by rail, and Riel was captured, tried for treason, convicted, and hanged. Macdonald refused to consider reprieving Riel, who was of uncertain mental health. The hanging of Riel proved bitterly controversial,{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=159\u2013162}} and alienated many Quebecers (like Riel, Catholic and culturally [[French Canadian]]) from the Conservatives\u2014they soon realigned themselves with the Liberals.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=138}}\n\nThe CPR was almost bankrupt, but its essential role in rushing troops to the crisis proved its worth, and Parliament provided money for its completion.

Americans fishermen had been using treaty provisions allowing them to land in Canada to take on wood and water as a cover for clandestine inshore fishing. Several vessels were detained in Canadian ports, to the outrage of Americans, who demanded their release. Macdonald sought to pass a Fisheries Act which would override some of the treaty provisions, to the dismay of the British, who were still responsible for external relations. The British government instructed the Governor General, [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], to reserve [[Royal Assent]] for the bill, effectively placing it on hold without vetoing it. After considerable discussion, the British government allowed Royal Assent at the end of 1886, and indicated it would send a warship to protect the fisheries if no agreement was reached with the Americans.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=454\u2013456}}\n\n===Fifth and sixth majorities, 1887\u20131891; death===\n[[File:John A Macdonald election poster 1891.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] election poster from 1891]]\n\nFearing continued loss of political strength as poor economic times continued, Macdonald planned to hold an election by the end of 1886, but had not yet issued the writ when [[1886 Ontario general election|an Ontario provincial election]] was called by Macdonald's former student, Liberal Ontario Premier [[Oliver Mowat]]. The provincial election was seen as a bellwether for the federal poll. Despite considerable campaigning by the Prime Minister, Mowat's Liberals were returned in Ontario, and increased their majority.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=454\u2013456}} Macdonald finally dissolved Parliament on 15 January 1887 for [[1887 Canadian federal election|an election]] on 22 February. During the campaign, Macdonald suffered another blow when the Quebec provincial Liberals were able to form a government (four months after [[1886 Quebec general election|the October 1886 Quebec election]]), forcing the Conservatives from power in Quebec City. Nevertheless, Macdonald and his cabinet campaigned hard in the winter election, with Tupper (the new [[High Commissioner]] to London) postponing his departure to try to bolster Conservative hopes in Nova Scotia. The Liberal leader, [[Edward Blake]], ran an uninspiring campaign, and the Conservatives were returned nationally with a majority of 35, winning easily in Ontario, Nova Scotia and Manitoba. The Tories even took a narrow majority of Quebec's seats despite resentment over Riel's hanging. Macdonald became MP for Kingston once again.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=466\u2013470}}{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=182\u2013184}} Even the younger ministers, such as future Prime Minister [[John Sparrow David Thompson|John Thompson]], who sometimes differed with Macdonald on policy, admitted the Prime Minister was an essential electoral asset for the Conservatives.{{sfn|Waite|1975|p=185}}\n\nBlake, whom Macdonald biographer Gwyn describes as the Liberal Party's \"worst campaigner until [[St\u00e9phane Dion]] early in the twenty-first century\",{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=355}} resigned after the defeat, to be replaced by [[Wilfrid Laurier]]. Under Laurier's early leadership, the Liberals, who had accepted much of the National Policy under Blake while questioning details, rejected it entirely, calling for \"unrestricted reciprocity\", or free trade, with the United States. Advocates of Laurier's plan argued that north\u2013south trade made more economic sense than trying to trade across the vast, empty prairies, using a CPR which was already provoking resentment for what were seen as high freight rates. Macdonald was willing to see some reciprocity with the United States, but was reluctant to lower many tariffs.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=141\u2013143}} American advocates of what they dubbed \"commercial union\" saw it as a prelude to political union, and did not scruple to say so, causing additional controversy in Canada.{{sfn|Waite|1975|p=203}}\n[[File:Macdonald lying in state.jpg|thumb|Sir John A.

Swainson suggests that Macdonald's desire for a free and tolerant Canada became part of its national outlook: \"He not only helped to create Canada, but contributed immeasurably to its character.\"{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=10}} Gwyn said of Macdonald,\n\n{{quote|text=His accomplishments were staggering: Confederation above all, but almost as important, if not more so, extending the country across the continent by a railway that was, objectively, a fiscal and economic insanity&nbsp;... On the ledger's other side, he was responsible for the CPR scandal, the execution of Louis Riel, and for the [[head tax (Canada)|head tax]] on Chinese workers. He's thus not easy to scan. His private life was mostly barren.

Canada]] (1867\u20131873, 1878\u20131891). The [[Fathers of Confederation|dominant figure]] of [[Canadian Confederation]], he had a political career which spanned almost half a century.\n\nMacdonald was born in [[Scotland]]; when he was a boy his family immigrated to [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] in the Province of [[Upper Canada]] (today in eastern [[Ontario]]). As a lawyer he was involved in several high-profile cases and quickly became prominent in Kingston, which elected him in 1844 to the legislature of the [[Province of Canada]]. By 1857, he had become [[List of Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada|premier]] under the colony's unstable political system.\n\nIn 1864, when no party proved capable of governing for long, Macdonald agreed to a proposal from his political rival, [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], that the parties unite in a [[Great Coalition]] to seek federation and political reform. Macdonald was the leading figure in the subsequent discussions and conferences, which resulted in the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act, 1867]] and the birth of Canada as a nation on 1 July 1867. Macdonald was the first Prime Minister of the new nation, and served 19&nbsp;years; only [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] served longer.\n\nIn 1873, he resigned from office over a scandal in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]. However, he was re-elected in 1878, continuing until he died in office in 1891. Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong [[Conservative Party of Canada (1867\u20131942)|Conservative Party]], promoting the protective tariff of the [[National Policy]], and completing the railway. He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from the national government in [[Ottawa]]. His most controversial move was to approve the execution of [[M\u00e9tis in Canada|M\u00e9tis]] leader [[Louis Riel]] for treason in 1885; it alienated many [[French language in Canada|francophones]] from his Conservative Party. He died in 1891, still in office; he is respected today for his key role in the formation of Canada.\n\nHe is criticized for his role in the [[Chinese head tax in Canada|Chinese Head Tax in Canada]] and the [[Pacific Scandal|Canadian Pacific Railway Scandal]]. However, [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of Canada|historical rankings]] have consistently placed Macdonald as one of the highest rated Prime Ministers in Canadian history.<ref name=\"Maclean's\">S.

After Hugh's business ventures left him in debt, the family immigrated to [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], in [[Upper Canada]] (today the southern and eastern portions of Ontario), in 1820, where there were already a number of relatives and connections.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=13}}\n\nThe family initially lived with another, but then resided over a store which Hugh Macdonald ran. Soon after their arrival, John's younger brother James died from a blow to the head by a servant who was supposed to look after the boys. After Hugh's store failed, the family moved to Hay Bay (south of [[Napanee, Ontario]]), west of Kingston, where Hugh unsuccessfully ran another shop. His father, in 1829, was appointed a magistrate for the [[Midland District, Upper Canada|Midland District]].{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=23}} John Macdonald's mother was a lifelong influence on her son, helping him in his difficult first marriage and remaining a force in his life until her 1862 death.{{sfn|Smith|McLeod|1989|p=1}}\n\nJohn initially attended local schools. When he was aged 10, his family scraped together the money to send him to Midland District Grammar School in Kingston.{{sfn|Smith|McLeod|1989|p=1}} Macdonald's formal schooling ended at 15, a common school-leaving age at a time when only children from the most prosperous families were able to attend university.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|p=18}} Nevertheless, Macdonald later regretted leaving school when he did, remarking to his secretary [[Joseph Pope (public servant)|Joseph Pope]] that if he had attended university, he might have embarked on a literary career.{{sfn|Pope|1894|p=4}}\n\n==Legal career, 1830\u20131843 ==\n\n===Legal training and early career, 1830\u20131837 ===\nMacdonald's parents decided he should become a lawyer after leaving school.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=19}} As [[Donald Creighton]] (who penned a two-volume biography of Macdonald in the 1950s) wrote, \"law was a broad, well-trodden path to comfort, influence, even to power\".{{sfn|Creighton|1952|p=19}} It was also \"the obvious choice for a boy who seemed as attracted to study as he was uninterested in trade.\"{{sfn|Creighton|1952|p=19}} Besides, Macdonald needed to start earning money immediately to support his family because his father's businesses were again failing. \"I had no boyhood,\" he complained many years later. \"From the age of 15, I began to earn my own living.\"{{sfn|Pope|1894|p=6}}\n\n[[File:Rideau-Street-house01.gif|thumb|A few months after he opened his first law office in 1835, Macdonald moved with his parents and sisters to this {{frac|2|1|2}}-storey stone house on Kingston's Rideau Street.]]\n\nMacdonald travelled by steamboat to Toronto (known until 1834 as [[York, Upper Canada|York]]), where he passed an examination set by [[The Law Society of Upper Canada]], including mathematics, Latin, and history. British North America had no law schools in 1830; students were examined when beginning and ending their tutelage. Between the two examinations, they were apprenticed, or articled to established lawyers.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=19\u201320}} Macdonald began his apprenticeship with George Mackenzie, a prominent young lawyer who was a well-regarded member of Kingston's rising Scottish community. Mackenzie practised corporate law, a lucrative speciality that Macdonald himself would later pursue.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=46\u201347}} Macdonald was a promising student, and in the summer of 1833, managed the Mackenzie office when his employer went on a business trip to Montreal and Quebec in [[Lower Canada]] (today the southern portion of the [[Quebec|province of Quebec]]). Later that year, Macdonald was sent to manage the law office of a Mackenzie cousin who had fallen ill.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nIn August 1834, George Mackenzie died of [[cholera]]. With his supervising lawyer dead, Macdonald remained at the cousin's law office in Hallowell (today [[Picton, Ontario]]). In 1835, Macdonald returned to Kingston, and even though not yet of age nor qualified, began his practice as a lawyer, hoping to gain his former employer's clients.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=32\u201334}} Macdonald's parents and sisters also returned to Kingston, and Hugh Macdonald became a bank clerk.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=38}}\n\nSoon after Macdonald was [[call to the bar|called to the Bar]] in February 1836, he arranged to take in two students; both became, like Macdonald, [[Fathers of Confederation]]. [[Oliver Mowat]] became premier of Ontario, and [[Alexander Campbell (Canadian senator)|Alexander Campbell]] a federal cabinet minister and [[Lieutenant Governor of Ontario]].{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=19}} One early client was Eliza Grimason, an Irish immigrant then aged sixteen, who sought advice concerning a shop she and her husband wanted to buy. Grimason would become one of Macdonald's richest and most loyal supporters, and may have also become his lover.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=41}} Macdonald joined many local organisations, seeking to become well known in the town. He also sought out high-profile cases, representing accused child rapist William Brass. Brass was hanged for his crime, but Macdonald attracted positive press comments for the quality of his defence.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|pp=41\u201342}} According to his biographer, [[Richard Gwyn]]:\n\n<blockquote>\nAs a criminal lawyer who took on dramatic cases, Macdonald got himself noticed well beyond the narrow confines of the Kingston business community. He was operating now in the arena where he would spend by far the greatest part of his life&nbsp;\u2013 the court of public opinion. And, while there, he was learning the arts of argument and of persuasion that would serve him all his political life.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=49}}\n</blockquote>\n\n===Professional prominence, 1837\u20131843 ===\nAll male Upper Canadians between 18 and 60&nbsp;years of age were members of the Sedentary Militia, which was called into active duty during the [[Rebellions of 1837]]. Macdonald served as a private in the militia, patrolling the area around Kingston, but the town saw no real action and Macdonald was not called upon to fire on the enemy.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=43}}\n\nAlthough most of the trials resulting from the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]] took place in Toronto, Macdonald represented one of the defendants in the one trial to take place in Kingston. All the Kingston defendants were acquitted, and a local paper described Macdonald as \"one of the youngest barristers in the Province <nowiki>[who]</nowiki> is rapidly rising in his profession\".{{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=53\u201354}}\n\n[[File:Battle of the Windmill.jpg|left|thumb|Battle of the Windmill, near Prescott, Upper Canada, 13 November 1838]]\n\nIn late 1838, Macdonald agreed to advise one of a group of American raiders who had crossed the border to liberate Canada from what they saw as the yoke of British colonial oppression. The inept invaders had been captured after the [[Battle of the Windmill]] (near [[Prescott, Ontario]]), in which 16 Canadians were killed and 60 wounded. Public opinion was inflamed against the prisoners, as they were accused of mutilating the body of a dead Canadian lieutenant. Macdonald biographer Donald Creighton wrote that Kingston was \"mad with grief and rage and horror\" at the allegations. Macdonald could not represent the prisoners, as they were tried by [[court-martial]] and civilian counsel had no standing. At the request of Kingston relatives of Daniel George, paymaster of the ill-fated invasion, Macdonald agreed to advise George, who, like the other prisoners, had to conduct his own defence.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=61\u201363}} George was convicted and hanged.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|p=67}} According to Macdonald biographer Donald Swainson, \"By 1838, Macdonald's position was secure. He was a public figure, a popular young man, and a senior lawyer.\"{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=21}}\n\nMacdonald continued to expand his practice while being appointed director of many companies, mainly in Kingston. Macdonald became both a director of and a lawyer for the new Commercial Bank of the Midland District. Throughout the 1840s, Macdonald invested heavily in real estate, including commercial properties in downtown Toronto.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=58}} Meanwhile, he was suffering from some illness, and in 1841, his father died. Sick and grieving, he decided to take a lengthy holiday in Britain in early 1842. He left for the journey well supplied with money, as he spent the last three days before his departure gambling at the card game [[loo (card game)|loo]] and winning substantially.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=23}} Sometime during his two months in Britain, he met his first cousin, [[Isabella Macdonald|Isabella Clark]]. As Macdonald did not mention her in his letters home, the circumstances of their meeting are not known.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=56}} In late 1842, Isabella journeyed to Kingston to visit with a sister.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=57}} The visit stretched for nearly a year before John and Isabella Macdonald married on 1 September 1843.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=59}}\n\n==Political rise, 1843\u20131864 ==\n\n===Parliamentary advancement, 1843\u20131857 ===\n[[File:Isabella Clark Macdonald.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Isabella Clark Macdonald, artist unknown.]]\n\nIn February 1843, Macdonald announced his candidacy for the post of [[alderman]] in Kingston's Fourth Ward.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=59}} On 29 March 1843, Macdonald celebrated his first election victory, with 156 votes against 43 for his opponent, Colonel Jackson. He also suffered what he termed his first downfall, as his supporters, carrying the victorious candidate, accidentally dropped him onto a slushy street.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=59}}\n\nThe [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] had merged Upper and Lower Canada into the [[Province of Canada]] effective in 1841. Kingston became the initial capital of the new province; Upper Canada and Lower Canada became known as Canada West and Canada East.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=22}} In March 1844, Macdonald was asked by local businessmen to stand as Conservative candidate for Kingston in [[List of elections in the Province of Canada#1844|the upcoming legislative election]].{{sfn|Phenix|2006|pp=63\u201364}} Macdonald followed the contemporary custom of supplying the voters with large quantities of alcohol.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=25}} In the era preceding the [[secret ballot]] when votes were publicly declared, Macdonald defeated his opponent, Anthony Manahan, by 275&nbsp;\"shouts\" to 42 when the two-day election concluded on 15 October 1844.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=64}} At that time, the Legislative Assembly met in Montreal. Macdonald was never an orator, and especially disliked the bombastic addresses of the time. Instead, he found a niche in becoming an expert on election law and parliamentary procedure.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=28}}\n\nIn 1844, Isabella fell ill. She recovered, but the illness recurred the following year, and she became an invalid. John Macdonald took his wife to [[Savannah, Georgia]], in the United States in 1845, hoping that the sea air and warmth would cure her ailments. Although John Macdonald was able to return to Canada after six months, Isabella remained in the United States for three years.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=28\u201329}} He visited her again in New York at the end of 1846, and returned several months later when she informed him she was pregnant.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|pp=79\u201383}} In August 1847 their son John Alexander Macdonald Jr. was born in New York, but as Isabella remained ill, relatives cared for the infant.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=30\u201331}}\n\nAlthough he was often absent due to his wife's illness, Macdonald was able to gain professional and political advancement. In 1846, he was made a [[Queen's Counsel]]. The same year, he was offered the non-cabinet post of [[Solicitor General of Canada|Solicitor General]], but declined it. In 1847, the [[Joint Premiers of the Province of Canada|Joint Premier]], [[William Henry Draper (judge)|William Henry Draper]], appointed Macdonald as Receiver General.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=31}} Accepting the government post required Macdonald to give up his law firm income{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=83}} and spend most of his time in Montreal, away from Isabella.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=31}} When elections were held in December 1848 and January 1849, Macdonald was easily reelected for Kingston, but the Conservatives lost seats and were forced to resign when the legislature reconvened in March 1848. Macdonald returned to Kingston when the legislature was not sitting, and Isabella joined him there in June.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=31}} In August, the child John Jr. died suddenly.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=85\u201386}} In March 1850, Isabella Macdonald gave birth to another boy, [[Hugh John Macdonald]], and his father wrote, \"We have got Johnny back again, almost his image.\"{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=37}} Macdonald began to drink heavily around this time, both in public and in private, which Patricia Phenix, who studied Macdonald's private life, attributes to his family troubles.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=107}}\n\nThe Liberals, or [[Clear Grits|Grits]], maintained power in the 1851 election, but soon, they were divided by a parliamentary scandal. In September, the government resigned, and a [[coalition]] government uniting parties from both parts of the province under Sir [[Allan MacNab]] took power. Macdonald did much of the work of putting the government together and served as [[Attorney General]]. The coalition which came to power in 1854 became known as the [[Liberal-Conservative Party|Liberal-Conservatives]] (referred to, for short, as the Conservatives). In 1855, [[George-\u00c9tienne Cartier]] of Canada East (today Quebec) joined the Cabinet. Until Cartier's 1873 death, he would be Macdonald's political partner. In 1856, MacNab was eased out as premier by Macdonald, who became the leader of the Canada West Conservatives.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=40\u201342}} Though the most powerful man in the government he remained as Attorney General, with Sir [[\u00c9tienne-Paschal Tach\u00e9]] as premier.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=162}}\n\n===Colonial leader, 1858\u20131864 ===\n[[File:John A Macdonald in 1858.jpg|thumb|upright|John A.

Hugh John Macdonald would be principally raised by his paternal aunt and her husband.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=130}}\n\nThe Assembly had voted to move the seat of government permanently to Quebec City. Macdonald had opposed that, and used his power to force the Assembly to reconsider in 1857. Macdonald proposed that [[Queen Victoria]] decide which city should be Canada's capital. Opponents, especially from Canada East, argued that the Queen would not make the decision in isolation; she would be bound to receive informal advice from her Canadian ministers. Nevertheless, Macdonald's scheme was adopted, with Canada East support assured by allowing Quebec City to serve a three-year term as the seat of government before the Assembly moved to the permanent capital. Macdonald privately asked the [[Colonial Office]] to ensure that the Queen would not respond for at least 10 months, or until after the general election.{{sfn|Creighton|1952|pp=248\u2013249}} In February 1858, the Queen's choice was announced, much to the dismay of many legislators from both parts of the province: the isolated Canada West town of [[Ottawa]].{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nOn 28 July 1858, an opposition Canada East member proposed an address to the Queen informing her that Ottawa was an unsuitable place for a national capital. Macdonald's Canada East party members [[crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] to vote for the address, and the government was defeated. Macdonald resigned, and the Governor General, [[Sir Edmund Walker Head, 8th Baronet|Sir Edmund Walker Head]], invited opposition leader [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]] to form a government. Under the law at that time, Brown and his ministers lost their seats in the Assembly by accepting office, and had to face [[by-election]]s. This gave Macdonald a majority pending the by-elections, and he promptly defeated the government. Head refused Brown's request for a dissolution of the Assembly, and Brown and his ministers resigned. Head then asked Macdonald to form a government. The law allowed anyone who had held a ministerial position within the last thirty days to accept a new position without needing to face a by-election; Macdonald and his ministers accepted new positions, then completed what was dubbed the \"Double Shuffle\" by returning to their old posts.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=175\u2013177}} In an effort to give the appearance of fairness, Head insisted that Cartier be titular premier, with Macdonald as his deputy.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=48}}\n\nIn the late 1850s and early 1860s, Canada enjoyed a period of great prosperity. The railroad and telegraph improved communications. According to Macdonald biographer Richard Gwyn, \"In short, Canadians began to become a single community.\"{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=194\u2013195}} At the same time, the provincial government became increasingly difficult to manage. An act affecting both Canada East and Canada West required a \"double majority\"\u2014a majority of legislators from each of the two sections of the province. This led to increasing deadlock in the Assembly.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|p=201}} The two sections each elected 65&nbsp;legislators, even though Canada West had a larger population. One of Brown's major demands was \"rep by pop\", that is, representation by population, which would lead to Canada West having more seats, and was bitterly opposed by Canada East.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=49}}\n\nThe [[American Civil War]] led to fears in Canada and in Britain that once the Americans had concluded their internal warfare, they would invade Canada again. Britain asked the Canadians to pay a part of the expense of defence, and a Militia Bill was introduced in the Assembly in 1862. The opposition objected to the expense, and Canada East representatives feared that French-Canadians would have to fight in a British-instigated war. At the time, Macdonald was drinking heavily, and he failed to provide much leadership on behalf of the bill. The government fell over the bill, and the Grits took over under the leadership of [[John Sandfield Macdonald]] (no relation to John A. Macdonald).{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=52\u201353}} John A. Macdonald did not remain out of power long; the parties remained closely matched, with a handful of independents able to destroy any government. The new government fell in May 1863, but Head allowed a new election, which made little change to party strength. In December 1863, Canada West MP [[Albert Norton Richards]] accepted the post of Solicitor-General, and so had to face a by-election. John A. Macdonald campaigned against Richards personally, and Richards was defeated by a Conservative. The switch in seats cost the Grits their majority, and they resigned in March. John A. Macdonald returned to office with Tach\u00e9 as titular premier. The Tach\u00e9-Macdonald government was defeated in June. The parties were deadlocked to such an extent that, according to Swainson, \"It was clear to everybody that the constitution of the Province of Canada was dead\".{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=54\u201355}}\n\n==Confederation of Canada, 1864\u20131867==\n[[File:QuebecConvention1864.jpg|thumb|300px|The Quebec Conference. Macdonald seated, fourth from left]]\nAs his government had fallen again, Macdonald approached the new governor general, [[Charles Monck, 4th Viscount Monck|Lord Monck]], and obtained a [[dissolution of parliament|dissolution]]. Before he could act on it, he was approached by Brown through intermediaries; the Grit leader felt that the crisis gave the parties the opportunity to join together for constitutional reform. Brown had led a parliamentary committee on confederation among the British North American colonies, which had reported back just before the Tach\u00e9-Macdonald government fell.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=286\u2013288}} Brown was more interested in representation by population; Macdonald's priority was a federation that the other colonies could join. The two compromised and agreed that the new government would support the \"federative principle\"\u2014a conveniently elastic phrase. The discussions were not public knowledge and Macdonald stunned the Assembly by announcing that the dissolution was being postponed because of progress in negotiations with Brown\u2014the two men were not only political rivals, but were known to hate each other.{{sfn|Gwyn|2007|pp=288\u2013289}}\n\nThe parties resolved their differences, joining in the [[Great Coalition]], with only the [[Parti rouge]] of Canada East, led by [[Jean-Baptiste-\u00c9ric Dorion]], remaining apart. A conference, called by the Colonial Office, was scheduled for 1 September 1864 in [[Charlottetown]], [[Prince Edward Island]]; the [[Maritimes]] were to consider [[Maritime Union|a union]]. The Canadians obtained permission to send a delegation\u2014led by Macdonald, Cartier, and Brown\u2014to what became known as the [[Charlottetown Conference]]. At its conclusion, the Maritime delegations expressed a willingness to join a confederation if the details could be worked out.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=63\u201365}}\n\nIn October 1864, delegates for confederation met in Quebec City for the [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]], where the [[Quebec Resolutions|Seventy-Two Resolutions]] were agreed to\u2014they would form the basis of Canada's government.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=67\u201369}} The Great Coalition was endangered by Tach\u00e9's 1865 death: Lord Monck asked Macdonald to become premier, but Brown felt that he had as good a claim on the position as his coalition partner. The disagreement was resolved by appointing another compromise candidate to serve as titular premier, [[Narcisse-Fortunat Belleau]].{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=73}}\n\nIn 1865, after lengthy debates, Canada's legislative assembly approved confederation by 91 votes to 33.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=72}} None of the Maritimes, however, had approved the plan. In 1866, Macdonald and his colleagues financed pro-confederation candidates in the [[1866 New Brunswick general election|New Brunswick general election]], resulting in a pro-confederation assembly. Shortly after the election, [[Nova Scotia]]'s premier, [[Charles Tupper]], pushed a pro-confederation resolution through that colony's legislature.{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=172}} A final conference, to be held in London, was needed before the British parliament could formalise the union. Maritime delegates left for London in July 1866, but Macdonald, who was drinking heavily again, did not leave until November, angering the Maritimers.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=75}} In December 1866, Macdonald both led the [[London Conference of 1866|London Conference]], winning acclaim for his handling of the discussions, and wooed and won his second wife, [[Agnes Macdonald, 1st Baroness Macdonald of Earnscliffe|Agnes Bernard]].{{sfn|Phenix|2006|p=175}} Bernard was the sister of Macdonald's private secretary, [[Hewitt Bernard]]; the couple first met in Quebec in 1860, but Macdonald had seen and admired her as early as 1856.{{sfn|Smith|McLeod|1989|p=36}} In January 1867, while still in London, he was seriously burned in his hotel room when his candle set fire to the chair he had fallen asleep in, but Macdonald refused to miss any sessions of the conference.

Canada verged on stagnation so many residents emigrated to the United States, where growth was much more rapid. Macdonald's solution was to build the transcontinental railroad to stimulate growth, and to implement a \"National Policy\" of high tariffs that would protect the small Canadian firms from American competition.<ref>Edgar McInnis, ''Canada: A political and social history'' (1982) pp 404\u201310.</ref>\n\n===First majority, 1867\u20131871===\n[[File:Canada provinces evolution 2.gif|thumb|300px|Timeline of the evolution of Canada's boundaries since 1867]]\n\nMacdonald and his government faced immediate problems upon formation of the new country. Much work remained to do in creating a federal government. Nova Scotia was already threatening to withdraw from the union; the Intercolonial Railway, which would both conciliate the Maritimes and bind them closer to the rest of Canada, was not yet built. Anglo-American relations were in a poor state, and Canadian foreign relations were matters handled from London. The withdrawal of the Americans in 1866 from the Reciprocity Treaty had increased tariffs on Canadian goods in US markets.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=80\u201381}} Much of present-day Canada remained outside confederation\u2014in addition to the separate colonies of Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland, and [[Colony of British Columbia|British Columbia]], which remained governed by the British, vast areas in the north and west belonged to the British and to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]].{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=81\u201382}} American and British opinion was that the experiment of Confederation would quickly unravel, and the nascent nation absorbed by the United States.{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=3}}\n\nIn August 1867, the new nation's [[1867 Canadian federal election|first general election]] was held; Macdonald's party won easily, with strong support in both large provinces, and a majority from New Brunswick.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|p=2}} Parliament convened in November,{{sfn|Creighton|1955|p=1}} surprisingly without Brown, who was defeated in Ontario and never served as a member of the [[House of Commons of Canada]].{{sfn|Creighton|1955|p=3}} By 1869, Nova Scotia had agreed to remain part of Canada after a promise of better financial terms\u2014the first of many provinces to negotiate concessions from Ottawa.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=84\u201385}} Pressure from London and Ottawa failed to gain the accession of Newfoundland, whose voters rejected a Confederation platform in a general election in October 1869.{{sfn|Waite|1975|p=76}}{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=72}}\n[[File:Macdonald1872.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Macdonald in the 1870s]]\n\nIn 1869, John and Agnes Macdonald had a daughter, Mary.

Immediately upon Confederation, he sent commissioners to London who in due course successfully negotiated the transfer of [[Rupert's Land]] and the [[North-Western Territory]] to Canada.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=85\u201386}} The Hudson's Bay Company received $1,500,000, and retained some trading posts as well as one-twentieth of the best farmland.{{r|esask, Rupert's Land purchase}} Prior to the effective date of acquisition, the Canadian government faced unrest in the [[Red River Colony]] (today southeastern [[Manitoba]], centred on [[Winnipeg]]). The local people, including the [[M\u00e9tis people (Canada)|M\u00e9tis]], were fearful that rule would be imposed on them which did not take into account their interests, and rose in the [[Red River Rebellion]] led by [[Louis Riel]]. Unwilling to pay for a territory in insurrection, Macdonald had troops put down the uprising before 15 July 1870 formal transfer, but as a result of the unrest, the Red River Colony joined Confederation as the province of Manitoba, while the rest of the purchased lands became the [[Northwest Territories|North-West Territories]].{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=80\u201383}} Following the [[North-West Rebellion]] of 1885 Macdonald implemented restrictions upon the movement of indigenous groups, requiring them to receive formal permission from an Indian Department Official in order to go off reserve.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The New Buffalo: The Struggle for Aboriginal Post-Secondary Education in Canada|last = Stonechild|first = Blair|publisher = University of Manitoba Press|year = 2006|isbn = 9780887556937|location = Winnipeg|page = [https://archive.org/details/newbuffalostrugg0000ston/page/19 19]|url = https://archive.org/details/newbuffalostrugg0000ston/page/19}}</ref>\n[[File:Uncle Sam kicked out.png|thumb|250px|\"We don't want you here.\" Annexation to the United States was a political issue in Canada's early days.

There was interest in the United States in bringing about the colony's annexation, and Macdonald wished to ensure his new nation had a Pacific outlet. The colony had an extremely large debt that would have to be assumed should it join Confederation. Negotiations were conducted in 1870, principally during Macdonald's illness and recuperation, with Cartier leading the Canadian delegation. Cartier offered British Columbia a railroad linking it to the eastern provinces within 10 years. The British Columbians, who privately had been prepared to accept far less generous terms, quickly agreed and joined Confederation in 1871.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=91\u201392}} The Canadian Parliament ratified the terms after a debate over the high cost that cabinet member [[Alexander Morris (politician)|Alexander Morris]] described as the worst fight the Conservatives had had since Confederation.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=105\u2013106}}\n\nThere were continuing disputes with the Americans over deep-sea fishing rights, and in early 1871, an Anglo-American commission was appointed to settle outstanding matters between the British (and Canadians) and the Americans. Canada was hoping to secure compensation for damage done by [[Fenians]] [[Fenian raids|raiding Canada]] from bases in the United States. Macdonald was appointed a British commissioner, a post he was reluctant to accept as he realised Canadian interests might be sacrificed for the mother country. This proved to be the case; Canada received no compensation for the raids and no significant trade advantages in the settlement, which required Canada to open her waters to American fishermen. Macdonald returned home to defend the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] against a political firestorm.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=93\u201394}}\n\n===Second majority and Pacific Scandal, 1872\u20131873===\nIn the run-up to [[1872 Canadian federal election|the 1872 election]], Macdonald had yet to formulate a railway policy, or to devise the loan guarantees that would be needed to secure the construction. During the previous year, Macdonald had met with potential railway financiers such as [[Hugh Allan]] and considerable financial discussion took place. Nevertheless, the greatest political problem Macdonald faced was the Washington treaty, which had not yet been debated in Parliament.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=112\u2013113}}\n\nIn early 1872, Macdonald submitted the treaty for ratification, and it passed the Commons with a majority of 66.{{sfn|Waite|1975|p=97}} The general election was held through late August and early September (future Canadian elections would be conducted, for the most part, on one day). Redistribution had given Ontario increased representation in the House; Macdonald spent much time campaigning in the province, for the most part outside Kingston. Widespread bribery of voters took place throughout Canada, a practice especially effective in the era when votes were publicly declared; in future elections the [[secret ballot]] would be used. Macdonald and the Conservatives saw their majority reduced from 35 to 8.{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=97\u2013100}} The Liberals (as the Grits were coming to be known) did better than the Conservatives in Ontario, forcing the government to rely on the votes of Western and Maritime MPs who did not fully support the party.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=96}}\n\n[[File:Whither are we drifting.png|thumb|250px|\"Whither are we drifting?\" Macdonald is shown triumphant at obtaining a prorogation, but is trampling a weeping Canada and apparently drunk with bottle in pocket in this August 1873 cartoon by [[John Wilson Bengough]].

Macdonald's government awarded the Allan group the charter in late 1872. In 1873, when Parliament opened, Liberal MP [[Lucius Seth Huntington]] charged that government ministers had been bribed with large, undisclosed political contributions to award the charter. Documents soon came to light which substantiated what came to be known as the [[Pacific Scandal]]. The Allan-led financiers, who were secretly backed by the United States's [[Northern Pacific Railway]],{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=200}} had donated $179,000 to the Tory election funds, they had received the charter, and Opposition newspapers began to publish telegrams signed by government ministers requesting large sums from the railway interest at the time the charter was under consideration. Macdonald had taken $45,000 in contributions from the railway interest himself. Substantial sums went to Cartier, who waged an expensive fight to try to retain his seat in [[Montreal East (electoral district)|Montreal East]] (he was defeated, but was subsequently returned for the Manitoba seat of [[Provencher]]). During the campaign Cartier had fallen ill with [[Bright's disease]], which may have been causing his judgment to lapse;{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=97\u2013100}} he died in May 1873 while seeking treatment in London.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=97\u2013100}}\n\nEven before Cartier's death, Macdonald attempted to use delay to extricate the government.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|p=156}} The Opposition responded by leaking documents to friendly newspapers. On 18 July, three papers published a telegram dated August 1872 from Macdonald requesting another $10,000 and promising \"it will be the last time of asking\".{{sfn|Waite|1975|p=103}} Macdonald was able to get a [[prorogation in Canada|prorogation of Parliament]] in August by appointing a [[Royal Commission]] to look into the matter, but when Parliament reconvened in late October, the Liberals, feeling Macdonald could be defeated over the issue, applied immense pressure to wavering members.{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nOn 3 November, Macdonald rose in the Commons to defend the government, and according to his biographer P.B. Waite, gave \"the speech of his life, and, in a sense, for his life\".{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=105\u2013106}} He began his speech at 9&nbsp;p.m., looking frail and ill, an appearance which quickly improved. As he spoke, he consumed glass after glass of gin and water. He denied that there had been a corrupt bargain, and stated that such contributions were common to both political parties. After five hours, Macdonald concluded,\n\n<blockquote>\nI leave it with this House with every confidence. I am equal to either fortune. I can see past the decision of this House either for or against me, but whether it be against me or for me, I know, and it is no vain boast to say so, for even my enemies will admit that I am no boaster, that there does not exist in Canada a man who has given more of his time, more of his heart, more of his wealth, or more of his intellect and power, as it may be, for the good of this Dominion of Canada.{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=105\u2013106}}\n</blockquote>\n\nMacdonald's speech was seen as a personal triumph, but it did little to salvage the fortunes of his government. With eroding support both in the Commons and among the public, Macdonald went to the Governor General, [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]] on 5 November and resigned; Liberal leader [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Alexander Mackenzie]] became the second Prime Minister of Canada. Following the resignation, Macdonald returned home and told his wife Agnes, \"Well, that's got along with\", and when asked what he meant, told her of his resignation, and stated, \"It's a relief to be out of it.\"{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=102\u2013103}} He is not known to have spoken of the events of the Pacific Scandal again.{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=255}} When Macdonald announced his resignation in the Commons, Conservative and Liberal MPs traded places on the benches of the House of Commons, though one Conservative MP, British Columbia's [[Amor De Cosmos]] remained in his place, thereby joining the Liberals.{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|pp=255\u2013256}}\n\nOn 6 November 1873, Macdonald offered his resignation as party leader to his caucus; it was refused. Mackenzie called [[1874 Canadian federal election|an election]] for January 1874; the Conservatives were reduced to 70&nbsp;seats out of the 206 in the Commons, giving Mackenzie a massive majority.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=180\u2013183}} The Conservatives bested the Liberals only in British Columbia; Mackenzie had called the terms by which the province had joined Confederation \"impossible\".{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=256}} Macdonald was returned in Kingston but was unseated on an election contest when bribery was proven; he won the ensuing by-election by 17&nbsp;votes.

He took long holidays and resumed his law practice, moving his family to Toronto and going into partnership with his son Hugh John.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=105\u2013107}} One mistake that Macdonald believed the Liberals had made was a free-trade agreement with Washington, negotiated in 1874; Macdonald had come to believe that protection was necessary to build Canadian industry.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=184\u2013185}} The [[Panic of 1873]] had led to a worldwide depression; the Liberals found it difficult to finance the railroad in such a climate, and were generally opposed to the line anyway\u2014the slow pace of construction led to British Columbia claims that the agreement under which it had entered Confederation was in jeopardy of being broken.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=108}}\n\nBy 1876, Macdonald and the Conservatives had adopted protection as party policy. This view was widely promoted in speeches at a number of political picnics, held across Ontario during the summer of 1876. Macdonald's proposals struck a chord with the public, and the Conservatives began to win a string of by-elections. By the end of 1876, the Tories had picked up 14&nbsp;seats as a result of by-elections, reducing [[Alexander Mackenzie (politician)|Mackenzie's]] Liberal majority from 70 to 42.{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=121\u2013122}} Despite the success, Macdonald considered retirement, wishing only to reverse the voters' verdict of 1874\u2014he considered [[Charles Tupper]] his heir apparent.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|p=227}}\n[[File:Riding into power.jpg|thumb|In this Bengough cartoon, Macdonald (centre, ankles crossed) rides the elephant of the National Policy into power in the 1878 election, trampling the Liberals underfoot.

Macdonald even campaigned in Quebec, which he had rarely done, leaving speechmaking there to Cartier.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=232\u2013234}} More picnics followed in 1878, promoting proposals which would come to be collectively called the \"[[National Policy]]\": high tariffs, rapid construction of the transcontinental railway (the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] or CPR), rapid agricultural development of the West using the railroad, and policies which would attract immigrants to Canada.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=111}} These picnics allowed Macdonald venues to show off his talents at campaigning, and were often lighthearted\u2014at one, the Tory leader blamed agricultural pests on the Grits, and promised the insects would go away if the Conservatives were elected.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=111\u2013112}}\n\nThe final days of the [[3rd Canadian Parliament]] were marked by explosive conflict, as Macdonald and Tupper alleged that MP and railway financier [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith]] had been allowed to build the [[Pembina, North Dakota|Pembina]] branch of the CPR (connecting to American lines) as a reward for betraying the Conservatives during the Pacific Scandal. The altercation continued even after the Commons had been summoned to the Senate to hear the dissolution read, as Macdonald spoke the final words recorded in the 3rd Parliament: \"That fellow Smith is the biggest liar I ever saw!\"{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=239\u2013240}}\n\n[[1878 Canadian federal election|The election]] was called for 17 September 1878.

Macdonald was duly returned for Victoria,{{r|parl|Bourinot 2008}} although he had never visited either Marquette or Victoria.{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=299}}\n\n===Third and fourth majorities, 1878\u20131887===\n[[File:Sir John Alexander Macdonald Nov 1833 Topley portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|Macdonald in November 1883, age 68]]\n\nPart of the National Policy was implemented in the budget presented in February 1879. Under that budget, Canada became a high-tariff nation like the United States and Germany. The tariffs were designed to protect and build Canadian industry\u2014finished textiles received a tariff of 34%, but the machinery to make them entered Canada free.{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=307}} Macdonald continued to fight for higher tariffs for the remainder of his life.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=115-16}}\n\n[[File:Mac steamroller.png|250px|thumb|Macdonald uses his parliamentary majority to roll to victory over Liberal leader [[Edward Blake]] and his party in this 1884 cartoon by [[John Wilson Bengough]]]]\nBy the 1880s, Macdonald was becoming more frail, but he maintained his political acuity. In 1883, he secured the \"Intoxicating Liquors Bill\" which took the regulation system away from the provinces, in part to stymie his foe Premier Mowat. In his own case, Macdonald took better control of his drinking and binges had ended. \"The great drinking-bouts, the gargantuan in sobriety's of his middle years, were dwindling away now into memories.\"<ref>Creighton, ''The Old Chieftain '' 2:345, 347</ref> As the budget moved forward, Macdonald studied the railway issue, and found the picture unexpectedly good. Although little money had been spent on the project under Mackenzie, several hundred miles of track had been built and nearly the entire route surveyed. In 1880, Macdonald found a syndicate, led by [[George Stephen, 1st Baron Mount Stephen|George Stephen]], willing to undertake the CPR project. Donald Smith (later Lord Strathcona) was a major partner in the syndicate, but because of the ill will between him and the Conservatives, Smith's participation was initially not made public, though it was well-known to Macdonald.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=116\u2013117}} In 1880, the Dominion took over Britain's remaining Arctic territories, which extended Canada to its present-day boundaries, with the exception of Newfoundland, which would not enter Confederation until 1949. Also in 1880, Canada sent its first diplomatic representative abroad, Sir [[Alexander Tilloch Galt|Alexander Galt]] as [[High Commission of Canada to the United Kingdom|High Commissioner to Britain]].{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=123}} With good economic times, Macdonald and the Conservatives were returned with a slightly decreased majority [[1882 Canadian federal election|in 1882]]. Macdonald was returned for the Ontario riding of [[Carleton (Ontario electoral district)|Carleton]].{{sfn|Creighton|1955|p=33}}\n\nThe [[transcontinental railroad]] project was heavily subsidised by the government. The CPR was granted {{convert|25000000|acre|km2 sqmi}} of land along the route of the railroad, and $25,000,000 from the government. In addition, the government was pledged to build $32,000,000 of other railways to support the CPR. The entire project was extremely costly, especially for a nation with only 4.1&nbsp;million people in 1881.{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=149\u2013150}} Between 1880 and 1885, as the railway was slowly built, the CPR repeatedly came close to financial ruin. Not only was the terrain in the [[Rocky Mountains]] difficult, the route north of [[Lake Superior]] proved treacherous, as tracks and engines sank into the [[muskeg]].{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=118\u2013119}} When Canadian guarantees of the CPR's bonds failed to make them salable in a declining economy, Macdonald obtained a loan to the corporation from the Treasury\u2014the bill authorizing it passed the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] just before the firm would have become insolvent.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=370\u2013376}}\n\n[[File:John Wilson Bengough 1885-08-29 A Riel Ugly Position (cropped).jpg|thumb|Protestants demanded Riel be executed; Catholics wanted him to live.

Negotiations between the M\u00e9tis and the Government to settle grievances over land rights proved difficult, Riel had lived in exile in the United States since 1870, he journeyed to Regina with the connivance of Macdonald's government, who believed he would prove a leader they could deal with.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=385\u2013388}} Instead, the M\u00e9tis rose the following year under Riel in the [[North-West Rebellion]]. Macdonald put down the rebellion with militia troops transported by rail, and Riel was captured, tried for treason, convicted, and hanged. Macdonald refused to consider reprieving Riel, who was of uncertain mental health. The hanging of Riel proved bitterly controversial,{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=159\u2013162}} and alienated many Quebecers (like Riel, Catholic and culturally [[French Canadian]]) from the Conservatives\u2014they soon realigned themselves with the Liberals.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|p=138}}\n\nThe CPR was almost bankrupt, but its essential role in rushing troops to the crisis proved its worth, and Parliament provided money for its completion.

Americans fishermen had been using treaty provisions allowing them to land in Canada to take on wood and water as a cover for clandestine inshore fishing. Several vessels were detained in Canadian ports, to the outrage of Americans, who demanded their release. Macdonald sought to pass a Fisheries Act which would override some of the treaty provisions, to the dismay of the British, who were still responsible for external relations. The British government instructed the Governor General, [[Henry Petty-Fitzmaurice, 5th Marquess of Lansdowne|Lord Lansdowne]], to reserve [[Royal Assent]] for the bill, effectively placing it on hold without vetoing it. After considerable discussion, the British government allowed Royal Assent at the end of 1886, and indicated it would send a warship to protect the fisheries if no agreement was reached with the Americans.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=454\u2013456}}\n\n===Fifth and sixth majorities, 1887\u20131891; death===\n[[File:John A Macdonald election poster 1891.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] election poster from 1891]]\n\nFearing continued loss of political strength as poor economic times continued, Macdonald planned to hold an election by the end of 1886, but had not yet issued the writ when [[1886 Ontario general election|an Ontario provincial election]] was called by Macdonald's former student, Liberal Ontario Premier [[Oliver Mowat]]. The provincial election was seen as a bellwether for the federal poll. Despite considerable campaigning by the Prime Minister, Mowat's Liberals were returned in Ontario, and increased their majority.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=454\u2013456}} Macdonald finally dissolved Parliament on 15 January 1887 for [[1887 Canadian federal election|an election]] on 22 February. During the campaign, Macdonald suffered another blow when the Quebec provincial Liberals were able to form a government (four months after [[1886 Quebec general election|the October 1886 Quebec election]]), forcing the Conservatives from power in Quebec City. Nevertheless, Macdonald and his cabinet campaigned hard in the winter election, with Tupper (the new [[High Commissioner]] to London) postponing his departure to try to bolster Conservative hopes in Nova Scotia. The Liberal leader, [[Edward Blake]], ran an uninspiring campaign, and the Conservatives were returned nationally with a majority of 35, winning easily in Ontario, Nova Scotia and Manitoba. The Tories even took a narrow majority of Quebec's seats despite resentment over Riel's hanging. Macdonald became MP for Kingston once again.{{sfn|Creighton|1955|pp=466\u2013470}}{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=182\u2013184}} Even the younger ministers, such as future Prime Minister [[John Sparrow David Thompson|John Thompson]], who sometimes differed with Macdonald on policy, admitted the Prime Minister was an essential electoral asset for the Conservatives.{{sfn|Waite|1975|p=185}}\n\nBlake, whom Macdonald biographer Gwyn describes as the Liberal Party's \"worst campaigner until [[St\u00e9phane Dion]] early in the twenty-first century\",{{sfn|Gwyn|2011|p=355}} resigned after the defeat, to be replaced by [[Wilfrid Laurier]]. Under Laurier's early leadership, the Liberals, who had accepted much of the National Policy under Blake while questioning details, rejected it entirely, calling for \"unrestricted reciprocity\", or free trade, with the United States. Advocates of Laurier's plan argued that north\u2013south trade made more economic sense than trying to trade across the vast, empty prairies, using a CPR which was already provoking resentment for what were seen as high freight rates. Macdonald was willing to see some reciprocity with the United States, but was reluctant to lower many tariffs.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=141\u2013143}} American advocates of what they dubbed \"commercial union\" saw it as a prelude to political union, and did not scruple to say so, causing additional controversy in Canada.{{sfn|Waite|1975|p=203}}\n[[File:Macdonald lying in state.jpg|thumb|Sir John A.

The Liberals were heavily financed by American interests; the Conservatives drew much financial support from the CPR. The 76-year-old Prime Minister collapsed during the campaign, and conducted political activities from his brother-in-law's house in Kingston. The Conservatives gained slightly in the popular vote, but their majority was trimmed to 27.{{sfn|Waite|1975|pp=208\u2013209}} The parties broke even in the central part of the country but the Conservatives dominated in the Maritimes and Western Canada, leading Liberal MP [[Richard John Cartwright]] to claim that Macdonald's majority was dependent on \"the shreds and patches of Confederation\". After the election, Laurier and his Liberals grudgingly accepted the National Policy, and when Laurier himself later became Prime Minister, he adopted it with only minor changes.{{sfn|Swainson|1989|pp=147\u2013148}}\n\nAfter the election, Macdonald suffered a stroke, which left him partially paralysed and unable to speak. \"The Old Chieftain\" lingered for days, remaining mentally alert, before dying in the late evening of Saturday, 6 June 1891.<ref>Creighton, 2:564-76</ref> Thousands filed by his open casket in the Senate Chamber; his body was transported by funeral train to his hometown of Kingston, with crowds greeting the train at each stop.

The [[Pipil language]], or Nawat, belongs to the [[Nahuan languages|Nahuatl]] dialect chain, which stretches from [[Durango]] in Mexico to El Salvador, historically also in central [[Honduras]] and the Pacific coast of [[Nicaragua]]. It is thought that the Pipil, along with the neighbouring [[Nicarao people]], migrated from Central Mexico to their present location around 900 AD, after the Chichimeca-Toltec civil war. As they settled in the area, they founded the city-state of [[Cuzcatlan]], absorbed many other pre-existing polities, and intermarried with the native peoples, mostly [[Lenca people]], [[Poqomam people]], and [[Xinca people]].\n\nTheir cosmovisi\u00f3n is related to the [[Toltec]], [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] and Lenca<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16DV3GDkKu8C&printsec=frontcover&hl=ru|title=Culture and Customs of El Salvador|first=Roy|last=Boland|date=17 October 2017|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|accessdate=17 October 2017|via=Google Books}}</ref> and by oral tradition said to have been adopted by [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']] and [[Poqomam people|Poqomam]] Mayan people during the Pipil [[wikt:exodus|exodus]] in the 9th century CE, led by [[Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl]]/Tupiltzin Ketzalkuat.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Etymology and Synonymy==\nThe name ''Pipil'' is the most commonly encountered term in the anthropological and linguistic literature. This [[exonym]] is from the closely related [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] word ''-pil'' \"son, boy\". Archaeologist William Fowler notes that ''pipil'' can be translated as \"noble\" and surmises that the invading Spanish and their [[Indian auxiliaries]] the [[Tlaxcala]] used the name as a reference to the population's elite, known as [[Pipiltin]], which owned land and composed a sovereign society state during the Toltec expansion. The Nawat Pipil themselves tell about a time when they descended from [[Nanauatzin]] the humbled one and when the Tulteku or Tolteca children had to flee to safety during the Chichimeca-Toltec civil war. In this reading, the name \"Pipil\" only later became associated with the people as a whole. The Spanish translated the term ''pipil'' as \"childish\" and was inspired by the simple form of Nahuatl spoken by the Tlaxcala and Mexica people living at a distance from the core civilization in Mexico.\n\nThe Pipil speak an [[endangered language|endangered]] [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] language [[Pipil language|''Nawat'']], but there is a movement of revitalization among young Nawat Pipil people.\n\nFor most authors the term ''Pipil or Nawat'' is used to refer to the language in only Central America (i.e. excluding Mexico). However, the term (along with the synonymous ''Eastern Nahuatl'') has also been used to refer to Nahuatl [[Variety (linguistics)|language varieties]] in the southern [[Veracruz]], [[Tabasco]], and [[Chiapas]] that like Pipil have reduced the earlier /tl/ sound to a /t/. The varieties in these three areas do share greater similarities with Nawat Pipil than the other Nahuatl varieties do (suggesting a closer connection); however, Campbell (1985) considers Nawat distinct enough to be considered a language separate from the Nahuatl complex, thus rejecting an ''Eastern Nahuatl'' subgrouping that includes Nawat.\n\nFinally, for other authors the term ''Aztec'' is used to refer to all closely languages in this region as a single language, not distinguishing Nahuat from Nahuatl (and sometimes not even separating out [[Pochutec]]). The classification of Nahuan that Campbell argues for (1985, 1997) has been superseded by newer and more detailed classifications. And currently the widely accepted classifications by Lastra de Suarez (1986) and Canger (1988), see Pipil as a Nahuan dialect of the eastern periphery.\n\n*Uto-Aztecan ''5000 BP''<sup>*</sup>\n**Shoshonean (Northern Uto-Aztecan)\n**Sonoran<sup>**</sup>\n**Aztecan  ''2000 BP'' (a.k.a.

[[Cuisnahuat]] and Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n have the highest concentration of Nawat Pipil speakers. Campbell's 1985 estimate (fieldwork 1970-1976) was 200 remaining speakers although as many as 2000 speakers have been recorded in official Mexican reports.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Gordon (2005) reports only 20 speakers (from 1987). The exact number of speakers is difficult to determine because native Nawat speakers do not wish to be identified due to historic government repression of aboriginal Salvadorean, such as ''[[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre|La Matanza]]'' (\"The Massacre\") of 1932.\n\n== History ==\nA cohesive group sharing a central Mexican culture migrated to the southern Guatemalan piedmont during the Late [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic period 2|Classic]]. They settled around the town of [[Santa Luc\u00eda Cotzumalguapa]], erecting Monument 4 at around the division between the Late and Terminal Classic. The culture lasted until the Spanish conquest, at which time they still maintained their Nawat language and culture, despite being surrounded by both Mayan allies and enemies .<ref name=\"coe5\">Michael Coe, ''The Maya'' (Thames and Hudson) 7th ed 2005 174-6 from 5th ed 1993 137-9</ref>\n\nThe region was rich in natural resources, particularly [[cacao bean|cacao]], [[indigo dye]] and tropical fruits.\n\nThe Pipil introduced the \"cults\" or treaties of [[Xipe Totec]], [[Tlaloc]], [[Quetzalcoatl]], [[Huehueteotl]], [[Ehecatl]], and [[Tlalchitonatiuh]]. Their architecture is life and death-obsessed; as in their central Mexican homeland, their \"religion\" demanded human sacrifice during war time as a warrior code of honor. The Pipil calendar (Tunaypuwa) was also expressed in central Mexican terms.<ref name=coe5 /> and was a [[lunisolar]] calendrical system.\n\nA third group, designated as the [[Izalco Pipil]], are believed to have migrated into the region late in the 10th century, occupying lands west of the [[Lempa River]] during the 11th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Legend and archaeological research suggest these migrants were refugees from conflict within the [[Toltec]] empire to the during the Chichimeca-Toltec civil war.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe Pipil organized a loose Confederacy known as [[Cuzcatlan]], with at least two centralized city/states that may have been subdivided into smaller principalities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The Pipil were also competent workers in [[cotton]] [[textiles]], and developed a wide-ranging trade network for woven goods as well as agricultural products.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Their cultivation of cacao, centred in the Izalcos area and involving a vast and sophisticated irrigation system, was especially lucrative and Pipil trade in cacao reached as far north as Teotihuacan and south to Costa Rica.\n\nBy the time the Spanish arrived, Pipil and [[Poqomam people|Poqomam]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] settlements were interspersed throughout western El Salvador, from the Lempa River to the border with Guatemala. There were four important branches of the Pipil:\n\n*The ''Cuzcatlecos'', who became the dominant power in the region that is today El Salvador, had their capital in Cuzcatlan (now the town of ''Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n'' in greater San Salvador).\n*The ''Izalcos'', who were very wealthy due to their great cacao and indigo dye production.\n*The ''Nonualcos'', of the central region, who were renowned for their warrior society.\n*The ''Mazuahas'', who were dedicated to raising the [[White Tailed Deer]].\n\nAlthough they were primarily an agricultural people, some Pipil urban centers developed into present-day cities, such as [[Sonsonate]] and [[Ahuachap\u00e1n]].  The dominant Pipil cities of Cuzcatlan and Tecpan [[Izalco]] in El Salvador were founded in approximately A.D. 1050.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Ruins in Aguilares and those close to the [[Guazapa (volcano)|Guazapa volcano]] are considered part of Pipil society. (The ruins of [[Cihuat\u00e1n]], sometimes attributed to the Pipil, is actually a Mayan site.)\n\n== Migration and legend ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n''Pipil'' may refer to a branch of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Toltec]] civilization, which flourished in Central [[Mexico]] around the close of the 1st millennium AD. The Toltec capital, [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrank.org/history/pages/6584/Tula.html|title=History Reference: Ancient History & World History|website=Jrank.org|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> also known as ''[[Tollan]]'' and located in the present-day state of [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] is the most significant [[archaeological site]] associated with the Toltec.  The apogee of Tula's reach post-dates that of the great city of [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]], which lies further to the southeast and quite close to the modern [[Mexico City]].\n\nTradition, mythology and archaeology strongly suggest these people arrived in El Salvador around the year A.D. 1000 as a result of the collapse of the ''Tala''. The Tala, apparently a Toltec subgroup or family line, gained power or influence in the Toltec civilization at the fall of Teotihuacan. This group was ultimately defeated in a bloody civil war over succession to the throne of the Toltec capital [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]]. The defeated group had little choice but to leave Mexico and emigrate to Central America. Tula fell a short time later, circa A.D. 1170, while under the reign of Huemac-Quetzalcoatl.\n\nThe faction that lost the war was led by the celebrated hero Topiltzin, son of [[Mixcoatl]]. His followers thought he was a reincarnation of the god [[Quetzalcoatl]], and used the name as a title. According to tradition, [[Topiltzin Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl]] founded a sanctuary to the god Nuictlan in the region of 'Guija Lake'. Later, he arrived at the now ruined Maya site of [[Cop\u00e1n]] in [[Honduras]] and subsequently went to the environs of the present [[Nicaragua]], where he established the people known as ''[[Nicarao people|Nicarao]]''.\n\n== Spanish conquest ==\n{{see also|Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Spanish conquest of El Salvador|Spanish conquest of Nicaragua}}\nIn the early 16th century, the Spanish [[conquistadores]] ventured into Central America from Mexico, then known as the Spanish colony of [[New Spain]]. After subduing the highland Mayan city-states through battle and cooptation, the Spanish sought to extend their dominion to the lower pacific region of the Pipiles, then dominated by the powerful city-state Confederacy of Cuscatl\u00e1n. [[Pedro de Alvarado]], a lieutenant of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], led the first Spanish invasion in June 1524. He was accompanied by thousands of Tlaxcala and Cakchiquel allies, who had long been rivals of Cuscatl\u00e1n for control over their wealthy cacao-producing region. The Pipil warriors met the Spanish forces in two major open battles that send the Christian army retreating back to Guatemala. The Spaniards left smallpox behind and came back with reinforcements. The surviving Cuscatl\u00e1n forces retreated into the mountains, where they sustained a guerrilla warfare against the Spanish allies who had proceeded to occupy the city of Cuscatl\u00e1n. Unable to defeat this resistance, and with Alvarado nursing a painful leg wound from Lord Atunal Tut's arrow in the first battle in Acajutla beach, Diego de Alvarado had to lead the rest of the conquest. Two subsequent Spanish expeditions were required to achieve the complete defeat of Cuscatl\u00e1n: one in 1525 and another in 1528.\n\nLegend say that a Pipil [[Cacique]] or Lord named [[Atlacatl]] and Lord [[Atunal Tut]] led the Pipil forces against first contact with the Spanish, the most famous battle being the [[Battle of Acajutla]] led by Atunal. The [[Annals of the Cakchiquels]] mention the name Pan Atacat (water men) in reference to coastal Pipiles. Could be a title for war chiefs or coastal warriors.\n\nAfter the Spanish victory, the Pipils became vassals of the Spanish Crown and were no longer called Pipiles by the Spanish but simply ''indios'' or Indians by the Vatican \"[[Discovery doctrine]]. The term ''Pipil'' has therefore remained associated, in mestizo Salvadoran rhetoric, with the pre-conquest indigenous culture. Today it is used by scholars to distinguish the indigenous population in El Salvador from other Nahuas-speaking groups such as those in Nicaragua. However, neither the self-identified indigenous population nor its political movement, which has revived in recent decades, uses the term \"pipil\" to describe themselves, but instead uses the term Nawat Pipil or simply \"\nindigenas (indigenous).\n\n== Modern Pipil ==\nPopular accounts of the Pipil have had a strong influence on the national mythology of El Salvador, with a large portion of the population claiming ancestry from this and other indigenous groups. Some 86% of today's Salvadorans are mestizos (people of mixed indigenous, black African and European descent), with less than ten percent of unmixed European ancestry. A small percentage (estimated by the government at 1%, by UNESCO at 2%, and by scholars at between 2 and 4%) is of pure or mostly pure indigenous ancestry, although numbers are disputed for political reasons. A few Pipil still speak Nawat and follow traditional ways of life. The traditional groups live mainly in the northwestern highlands near the Guatemalan border, but numerous self-identified indigenous populations live in other areas, such as the Nonualcos south of the capital and the Lenca people in the east.\n\nAccording to a special report in ''El Diario de Hoy'', due to preservation and revitalization efforts of various non-profit organizations in conjunction with several universities, combined with a post-civil war resurgence of Pipil identity in the country of El Salvador, the number of Nawat Pipil speakers rose from 200 in the 1980s to 3,000 speakers in 2009. The vast majority are young people, giving the language hope of being pulled from the brink of extinction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=6482&idArt=3957733 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928064607/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=6482&idArt=3957733 |archivedate=2012-09-28 }}</ref>\n\nThere is also a renewed interest in the preservation of the traditional beliefs and other cultural practices of the Pipil, as well as a greater willingness by the communities to perform their ceremonies in public and wearing traditional clothing                 \n== Notable Pipil ==                 \n*[[Anastasio Aquino's Rebellion]], Tagateku Nanualco war chief\n*[[Prudencia Ayala]], indigenous rights activist               \n*[[Feliciano Ama]], [[Izalco]] chief                                                    \n*[[Francisco \"Chico\" S\u00e1nchez]], Juayua Chief                   \n*[[Nantzin Paula L\u00f3pez Witzapan]], poet and Nawat linguist (1959-2016)               \n*[[Alicia Maria Siu]], muralist\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|El Salvador}}.           \n*[[Mozote Massacre]]               \n*[[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre]]                        \n*[[Annals of the Cakchiquels]]\n*[[Pipil language]]\n*[[Pipil language (typological overview)]]\n*[[Pipil grammar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*  [[John Bierhorst|Bierhorst, John]].

The [[Pipil language]], or Nawat, belongs to the [[Nahuan languages|Nahuatl]] dialect chain, which stretches from [[Durango]] in Mexico to El Salvador, historically also in central [[Honduras]] and the Pacific coast of [[Nicaragua]]. It is thought that the Pipil, along with the neighbouring [[Nicarao people]], migrated from Central Mexico to their present location around 900 AD, after the Chichimeca-Toltec civil war.

This [[exonym]] is from the closely related [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] word ''-pil'' \"son, boy\". Archaeologist William Fowler notes that ''pipil'' can be translated as \"noble\" and surmises that the invading Spanish and their [[Indian auxiliaries]] the [[Tlaxcala]] used the name as a reference to the population's elite during the Toltec expansion, known as [[Pipiltin]], which owned land and composed a sovereign society state. The Nawat Pipil themselves tell about a time when they descended from [[Nanauatzin]] the humbled one and when the Tulteku or Tolteca children had to flee to safety during the Chichimeca-Toltec civil war. In this reading, the name \"Pipil\" only later became associated with the people as a whole. The Spanish translated the term ''pipil'' as \"childish\" and was inspired by the simple form of Nahuatl spoken by the Tlaxcala and Mexica people living at a distance from the core civilization in Mexico.\n\nThe Pipil speak an [[endangered language|endangered]] [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] language [[Pipil language|''Nawat'']], but there is a movement of revitalization among young Nawat Pipil people.\n\nFor most authors the term ''Pipil or Nawat'' is used to refer to the language in only Central America (i.e. excluding Mexico). However, the term (along with the synonymous ''Eastern Nahuatl'') has also been used to refer to Nahuatl [[Variety (linguistics)|language varieties]] in the southern [[Veracruz]], [[Tabasco]], and [[Chiapas]] that like Pipil have reduced the earlier /tl/ sound to a /t/. The varieties in these three areas do share greater similarities with Nawat Pipil than the other Nahuatl varieties do (suggesting a closer connection); however, Campbell (1985) considers Nawat distinct enough to be considered a language separate from the Nahuatl complex, thus rejecting an ''Eastern Nahuatl'' subgrouping that includes Nawat.\n\nFinally, for other authors the term ''Aztec'' is used to refer to all closely languages in this region as a single language, not distinguishing Nahuat from Nahuatl (and sometimes not even separating out [[Pochutec]]). The classification of Nahuan that Campbell argues for (1985, 1997) has been superseded by newer and more detailed classifications. And currently the widely accepted classifications by Lastra de Suarez (1986) and Canger (1988), see Pipil as a Nahuan dialect of the eastern periphery.\n\n*Uto-Aztecan ''5000 BP''<sup>*</sup>\n**Shoshonean (Northern Uto-Aztecan)\n**Sonoran<sup>**</sup>\n**Aztecan  ''2000 BP'' (a.k.a.

[[Cuisnahuat]] and Santo Domingo de Guzm\u00e1n have the highest concentration of Nawat Pipil speakers. Campbell's 1985 estimate (fieldwork 1970-1976) was 200 remaining speakers although as many as 2000 speakers have been recorded in official Mexican reports.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Gordon (2005) reports only 20 speakers (from 1987). The exact number of speakers is difficult to determine because native Nawat speakers do not wish to be identified due to historic government repression of aboriginal Salvadorean, such as ''[[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre|La Matanza]]'' (\"The Massacre\") of 1932.\n\n== History ==\nA cohesive group sharing a central Mexican culture migrated to the southern Guatemalan piedmont during the Late [[Mesoamerican chronology#Classic period 2|Classic]]. They settled around the town of [[Santa Luc\u00eda Cotzumalguapa]], erecting Monument 4 at around the division between the Late and Terminal Classic. The culture lasted until the Spanish conquest, at which time they still maintained their Nawat language and culture, despite being surrounded by both Mayan allies and enemies .<ref name=\"coe5\">Michael Coe, ''The Maya'' (Thames and Hudson) 7th ed 2005 174-6 from 5th ed 1993 137-9</ref>\n\nThe region was rich in natural resources, particularly [[cacao bean|cacao]], [[indigo dye]] and tropical fruits.\n\nThe Pipil introduced the \"cults\" or treaties of [[Xipe Totec]], [[Tlaloc]], [[Quetzalcoatl]], [[Huehueteotl]], [[Ehecatl]], and [[Tlalchitonatiuh]]. Their architecture is life and death-obsessed; as in their central Mexican homeland, their \"religion\" demanded human sacrifice during war time as a warrior code of honor. The Pipil calendar (Tunaypuwa) was also expressed in central Mexican terms.<ref name=coe5 /> and was a [[lunisolar]] calendrical system.\n\nA third group, designated as the [[Izalco Pipil]], are believed to have migrated into the region late in the 10th century, occupying lands west of the [[Lempa River]] during the 11th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Legend and archaeological research suggest these migrants were refugees from conflict within the [[Toltec]] empire to the during the Chichimeca-Toltec civil war.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n\nThe Pipil organized a loose Confederacy known as [[Cuzcatlan]], with at least two centralized city/states that may have been subdivided into smaller principalities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} The Pipil were also competent workers in [[cotton]] [[textiles]], and developed a wide-ranging trade network for woven goods as well as agricultural products.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Their cultivation of cacao, centred in the Izalcos area and involving a vast and sophisticated irrigation system, was especially lucrative and Pipil trade in cacao reached as far north as Teotihuacan and south to Costa Rica.\n\nBy the time the Spanish arrived, Pipil and [[Poqomam people|Poqomam]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] settlements were interspersed throughout western El Salvador, from the Lempa River to the border with Guatemala. There were four important branches of the Pipil:\n\n*The ''Cuzcatlecos'', who became the dominant power in the region that is today El Salvador, had their capital in Cuzcatlan (now the town of ''Antiguo Cuscatl\u00e1n'' in greater San Salvador).\n*The ''Izalcos'', who were very wealthy due to their great cacao and indigo dye production.\n*The ''Nonualcos'', of the central region, who were renowned for their warrior society.\n*The ''Mazuahas'', who were dedicated to raising the [[White Tailed Deer]].\n\nAlthough they were primarily an agricultural people, some Pipil urban centers developed into present-day cities, such as [[Sonsonate]] and [[Ahuachap\u00e1n]].  The dominant Pipil cities of Cuzcatlan and Tecpan [[Izalco]] in El Salvador were founded in approximately A.D. 1050.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Ruins in Aguilares and those close to the [[Guazapa (volcano)|Guazapa volcano]] are considered part of Pipil society. (The ruins of [[Cihuat\u00e1n]], sometimes attributed to the Pipil, is actually a Mayan site.)\n\n== Migration and legend ==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n''Pipil'' may refer to a branch of the [[pre-Columbian]] [[Toltec]] civilization, which flourished in Central [[Mexico]] around the close of the 1st millennium AD. The Toltec capital, [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jrank.org/history/pages/6584/Tula.html|title=History Reference: Ancient History & World History|website=Jrank.org|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> also known as ''[[Tollan]]'' and located in the present-day state of [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] is the most significant [[archaeological site]] associated with the Toltec.  The apogee of Tula's reach post-dates that of the great city of [[Teotihuac\u00e1n]], which lies further to the southeast and quite close to the modern [[Mexico City]].\n\nTradition, mythology and archaeology strongly suggest these people arrived in El Salvador around the year A.D. 1000 as a result of the collapse of the ''Tala''. The Tala, apparently a Toltec subgroup or family line, gained power or influence in the Toltec civilization at the fall of Teotihuacan. This group was ultimately defeated in a bloody civil war over succession to the throne of the Toltec capital [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]]. The defeated group had little choice but to leave Mexico and emigrate to Central America. Tula fell a short time later, circa A.D. 1170, while under the reign of Huemac-Quetzalcoatl.\n\nThe faction that lost the war was led by the celebrated hero Topiltzin, son of [[Mixcoatl]]. His followers thought he was a reincarnation of the god [[Quetzalcoatl]], and used the name as a title. According to tradition, [[Topiltzin Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl]] founded a sanctuary to the god Nuictlan in the region of 'Guija Lake'. Later, he arrived at the now ruined Maya site of [[Cop\u00e1n]] in [[Honduras]] and subsequently went to the environs of the present [[Nicaragua]], where he established the people known as ''[[Nicarao people|Nicarao]]''.\n\n== Spanish conquest ==\n{{see also|Spanish conquest of Guatemala|Spanish conquest of El Salvador|Spanish conquest of Nicaragua}}\nIn the early 16th century, the Spanish [[conquistadores]] ventured into Central America from Mexico, then known as the Spanish colony of [[New Spain]]. After subduing the highland Mayan city-states through battle and cooptation, the Spanish sought to extend their dominion to the lower pacific region of the Pipiles, then dominated by the powerful city-state Confederacy of Cuscatl\u00e1n. [[Pedro de Alvarado]], a lieutenant of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], led the first Spanish invasion in June 1524. He was accompanied by thousands of Tlaxcala and Cakchiquel allies, who had long been rivals of Cuscatl\u00e1n for control over their wealthy cacao-producing region. The Pipil warriors met the Spanish forces in two major open battles that send the Christian army retreating back to Guatemala. The Spaniards left smallpox behind and came back with reinforcements. The surviving Cuscatl\u00e1n forces retreated into the mountains, where they sustained a guerrilla warfare against the Spanish allies who had proceeded to occupy the city of Cuscatl\u00e1n. Unable to defeat this resistance, and with Alvarado nursing a painful leg wound from Lord Atunal Tut's arrow in the first battle in Acajutla beach, Diego de Alvarado had to lead the rest of the conquest. Two subsequent Spanish expeditions were required to achieve the complete defeat of Cuscatl\u00e1n: one in 1525 and another in 1528.\n\nLegend say that a Pipil [[Cacique]] or Lord named [[Atlacatl]] and Lord [[Atunal Tut]] led the Pipil forces against first contact with the Spanish, the most famous battle being the [[Battle of Acajutla]] led by Atunal. The [[Annals of the Cakchiquels]] mention the name Pan Atacat (water men) in reference to coastal Pipiles. Could be a title for war chiefs or coastal warriors.\n\nAfter the Spanish victory, the Pipils became vassals of the Spanish Crown and were no longer called Pipiles by the Spanish but simply ''indios'' or Indians by the Vatican \"[[Discovery doctrine]]. The term ''Pipil'' has therefore remained associated, in mestizo Salvadoran rhetoric, with the pre-conquest indigenous culture. Today it is used by scholars to distinguish the indigenous population in El Salvador from other Nahuas-speaking groups such as those in Nicaragua. However, neither the self-identified indigenous population nor its political movement, which has revived in recent decades, uses the term \"pipil\" to describe themselves, but instead uses the term Nawat Pipil or simply \"\nindigenas (indigenous).\n\n== Modern Pipil ==\nPopular accounts of the Pipil have had a strong influence on the national mythology of El Salvador, with a large portion of the population claiming ancestry from this and other indigenous groups. Some 86% of today's Salvadorans are mestizos (people of mixed indigenous, black African and European descent), with less than ten percent of unmixed European ancestry. A small percentage (estimated by the government at 1%, by UNESCO at 2%, and by scholars at between 2 and 4%) is of pure or mostly pure indigenous ancestry, although numbers are disputed for political reasons. A few Pipil still speak Nawat and follow traditional ways of life. The traditional groups live mainly in the northwestern highlands near the Guatemalan border, but numerous self-identified indigenous populations live in other areas, such as the Nonualcos south of the capital and the Lenca people in the east.\n\nAccording to a special report in ''El Diario de Hoy'', due to preservation and revitalization efforts of various non-profit organizations in conjunction with several universities, combined with a post-civil war resurgence of Pipil identity in the country of El Salvador, the number of Nawat Pipil speakers rose from 200 in the 1980s to 3,000 speakers in 2009. The vast majority are young people, giving the language hope of being pulled from the brink of extinction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=6482&idArt=3957733 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120928064607/http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=6482&idArt=3957733 |archivedate=2012-09-28 }}</ref>\n\nThere is also a renewed interest in the preservation of the traditional beliefs and other cultural practices of the Pipil, as well as a greater willingness by the communities to perform their ceremonies in public and wearing traditional clothing                 \n== Notable Pipil ==                 \n*[[Anastasio Aquino's Rebellion]], Tagateku Nanualco war chief\n*[[Prudencia Ayala]], indigenous rights activist               \n*[[Feliciano Ama]], [[Izalco]] chief                                                    \n*[[Francisco \"Chico\" S\u00e1nchez]], Juayua Chief                   \n*[[Nantzin Paula L\u00f3pez Witzapan]], poet and Nawat linguist (1959-2016)               \n*[[Alicia Maria Siu]], muralist\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|El Salvador}}.           \n*[[Mozote Massacre]]               \n*[[1932 Salvadoran peasant massacre]]                        \n*[[Annals of the Cakchiquels]]\n*[[Pipil language]]\n*[[Pipil language (typological overview)]]\n*[[Pipil grammar]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*  [[John Bierhorst|Bierhorst, John]].
