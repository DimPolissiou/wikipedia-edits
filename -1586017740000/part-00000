Humanitarian workers traded food and relief items for sexual favors. Teachers in schools in the camps exploited children in exchange for passing grades.

It defines sexual exploitation as:<blockquote>\nAny actual or attempted abuse of a position of vulnerability, differential power, or trust, for sexual purposes, including, but not limited to, profiting monetarily, socially or politically from sexual exploitation of another.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hapinternational.org/pool/files/sgs-bulletin.pdf |title=Secretary-General's Bulletin |page=1 }}</ref>\n</blockquote> It prohibits such behavior by all UN staff and by the staff of all organizations working in cooperative arrangements with the UN (i.e. [[Code of Conduct for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief#Application_of_the_Code|NGHAs]]). In addition, the bulletin outlines sanctions and procedures to be followed for preventing sexual exploitation and abuse.\n\n===Building Safer Organisations project===\nIn November 2004 a collaborative effort by a number of NGOs set up the Building Safer Organisations project (BSO), to develop the capacity of NGOs \"to receive and investigate allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse brought by persons of concern\u2014including refugees, displaced persons and local host populations\". Hosted at the outset as a pilot project by the umbrella organization, the International Council of Voluntary Agencies (ICVA), the project initially developed training materials. Using these materials, the BSO project carried out participatory workshops for NGO and UN staff. As of June 2006, a total of 137 NGO staff took part in management or investigation workshops.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icva.ch/doc00001781.html#icva |title=Women's Commission Evaluation}}</ref> In April 2007 BSO was moved to [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]], where it has been merged with HAP's complaints unit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hapinternational.org/projects/complaints-handling/building-safer-organizations/history-of-bso.aspx |title=HAP Projects}}</ref>  By April 2008, BSO had held \"16 Investigation workshops; seven Investigations Follow-up workshops; seven Management workshops as well as four Training of Trainers workshops and 1 Complaints Mechanisms workshop. 522 humanitarian agency staff has participated in the BSO Learning Programme workshops.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hapinternational.org/pool/files/bbc-report-lowres.pdf |title=To complain or not to complain: still the question |page=12, fn. 6}}</ref>\n\nSince its inception, BSO has been helping organisations apply principles of good complaint-and-response systems to cases of sexual exploitation and abuse by staff. BSO helps NGOs achieve greater accountability by:    \n* Training NGO staff through the BSO Investigations Learning Programme (LP) on conducting fair, thorough and confidential investigations into complaints of sexual exploitation and abuse of disaster survivors\n* Promoting implementation of common standards on preventing and responding to sexual exploitation and abuse by working with national and regional networks\n* Publishing guidelines<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hapinternational.org/pool/files/bso-guidelines.pdf |title=Guidelines |publisher=hapinternational.org }}</ref> on complaints mechanisms and investigation procedures, and a training handbook<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hapinternational.org/pool/files/bso-handbook.pdf |title=Handbook |publisher=hapinternational.org }}</ref> containing the Investigations Learning Programmes\n* Providing opportunities for peer-to-peer engagement\n* Supporting NGOs to develop better practices through research and advocacy<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.hapinternational.org/projects/complaints-handling/building-safer-organizations.aspx |title=HAP Services |publisher=hapinternational.org}}</ref>\n\nAn independent evaluation by the Women's Commission for Refugee Women and Children concluded that the \"BSO learning program has proven a valuable tool for humanitarian agencies in strengthening their capacity to receive and investigate allegations of sexual exploitation and abuse of beneficiaries by staff....(and) BSO learning program materials are effective and well received\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icva.ch/doc00001781.html#key |title=Women's Commission Evaluation June 2006 |publisher=icva.ch}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|Lack of complaints}}Reasons for few complaints==\nTwo 2008 studies have pointed out that disaster survivors who have been sexually exploited (or abused) by aid workers often do not complain. [[Save the Children]] explains the lack of complaints thus:\n* Children (and adults) are inadequately supported to speak out about abuse against them.\n* The international community does not exercise strong-enough leadership or managerial courage on this issue.\n* There is a lack of investment in child protection by governments and donors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/en/54_5706.htm |title=\"No One to Turn To\" Save the Children UK |year=2008 |page= 20}}</ref>\n\nOn 25 June 2008 the [[Humanitarian Accountability Partnership International]] (HAP) released a report on sexual exploitation and abuse, \"To complain or not to complain: still the question.\" This report includes details for three countries in which consultations were held. It concludes:\n<blockquote>\nSexual exploitation and abuse is a predictable result of a failure of accountability to beneficiaries of humanitarian aid. The single most important reason for this \u2018humanitarian accountability deficit\u2019 is the asymmetrical principal-agent relations that characterise most \u2018humanitarian\u2019 transactions, that puts the users of humanitarian assistance at a structural disadvantage in their relationship with humanitarian aid providers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hapinternational.org/pool/files/bbc-report-lowres.pdf |title=To complain or not to complain: still the question | page=52 |publisher=reliefweb.int}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.un.org/pseataskforce United Nations]\n* [http://hapinternational.org/pool/files/sgs-bulletin.pdf Secretary-General's Bulletin]\n* [https://www.un.org/en/pseataskforce/docs/statement_of_commitment_on_eliminating_sexual%20_exploitation.doc Statement of Commitment on Eliminating Sexual Exploitation and Abuse by UN and Non-UN Personnel, August 2008]\n* [http://www.hapinternational.org/pool/files/bso-guidelines.pdf HAP: Building Safer Organisations Handbook]\n* [http://www.hapinternational.org/pool/files/bso-handbook.pdf  HAP: Building Safer Organisations Guidelines]\n* [http://www.hapinternational.org/pool/files/from-camp-to-community.pdf Save the Children UK: From Camp to Community]\n\n{{abuse}}\n\n[[Category:Humanitarian aid]]\n[[Category:Sexual abuse]]\n[[Category:Sexual exploitation]]\n", "text_old": "'''[[Humanitarian_principles#Sexual_exploitation_and_abuse|Sexual exploitation and abuse in humanitarian response]]''' first came to public attention with the release of a report in February 2002 of a joint assessment mission examining the issue.
