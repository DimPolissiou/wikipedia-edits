The convention was held at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] from July 13 to July 16, 1992. The Clinton-Gore ticket then faced and defeated their Republican opponents, President [[George H. W. Bush]] and Vice President [[Dan Quayle]] as well as the independent ticket of [[Ross Perot]] and [[James Stockdale]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1992|1992 presidential election]].\n\nThe convention's keynote speaker was [[Georgia Governor]] [[Zell Miller]] who said, \"Not all of us can be born rich, handsome, and lucky, and that's why we have a Democratic Party\" and added,\n\"Our Commander in Chief talks like [[Dirty Harry]] but acts like [[Barney Fife]].\"  Other notable speakers included [[Democratic National Committee]] Chair [[Ron Brown]], [[Elizabeth Glaser]], and [[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Mario Cuomo]].\n\nThe convention, organized by chairman [[Ron Brown]], was seen as a great success. Unlike some earlier Democratic conventions, it had been well planned and run with few gaffes or errors, as even Republicans conceded. As Clinton finished his acceptance speech [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s \"[[Don't Stop (Fleetwood Mac song)|Don't Stop]]\", which would become the [[theme song]] of Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, was played several times during the balloon drop and celebration.\n\nClinton received a significant poll bounce from the convention, due to both the perceived success of the convention, as well as [[Ross Perot]] announcing he was withdrawing from the campaign just as the convention was ending (Perot got back into the race in October).\n\nThe [[convention bounce]] gave the Clinton/Gore ticket a lead that only shrank significantly when Ross Perot re-entered the race.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DC113DF935A35753C1A964958260 | work=The New York Times | title=THE 1992 CAMPAIGN: Poll; Poll Finds Hostility to Perot And No Basic Shift in Race | first=Robin | last=Toner | date=October 6, 1992 | accessdate=April 20, 2010}}</ref> Clinton and Gore went on to defeat President Bush and Vice-President Quayle, as well as independent candidate [[Ross Perot]] and his running mate, [[James Stockdale]], in the [[1992 United States presidential election|general election]].\n\n==Casey controversy==<!-- This section is linked from [[1992 United States presidential election]] -->\n[[Governor of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania Governor]] [[Robert P.

The convention was held at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]] from July 13 to July 16, 1992. The Clinton-Gore ticket then faced and defeated their Republican opponents, President [[George H. W.
