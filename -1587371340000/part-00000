Reference to weaving and spinning materials is found in the [[Vedic Literature]]. There was textile trade in India during the early centuries. A block printed and resist-dyed fabric, whose origin is from [[Gujarat]] was found in the tombs of [[Fostat]], Egypt. This proves that Indian export of cotton textiles to Egypt or the Nile Civilization in medieval times were to a large extent. Large quantity of north Indian silk were traded through the [[silk route]] in China <ref>{{cite web|title=History of Textile|url=http://www.textileasart.com/weaving.htm}}</ref>  to the western countries. The Indian silks were often exchanged with the western countries for their spices in the [[barter system]]. During the late 17th and 18th century there were large export of the Indian cotton to the western countries to meet the need of the European industries during [[industrial revolution]], apart from the domestic requirement at the [[Indian Ordnance Factories]].<ref>http://ofb.gov.in/units/index.php?unit=ocfs&page=about&lang=en</ref><ref>http://ofb.gov.in/units/index.php?unit=oefc&page=about&lang=en</ref>\n\nThe Textile industry was the major component of economic income in India before the English colonies. \"The hand-loom and the spinning-wheel, producing their regular myriads of spinners and weavers, were the pivots of the structure of that society,\" described by Karl Marx.<ref> Marx, Karl. \u201cThe British Rule in India.\u201d New York Daily Tribune, 25 June 1853.</ref> Due to the abolishment of slavery in the Americas, England began to search for another source of cheap cotton, and saw India as a ripe place for this. They convinced many farmers to switch from subsistence farming to producing and exporting huge amounts of cotton, after a long period of protectionism over the English textile industry.[https://www.thefridaytimes.com/weaving-misery/] Eventually, through colonization, the traditional method of artisan Textile production was destroyed, and replaced with large scale factory production.\n\n==Production==\nIndia is the second largest producer of fibre in the world and the major fibre produced is [[cotton]]. Other fibres produced in India include [[silk]], [[jute]], [[wool]], and [[man-made fibers]]. 60% of the Indian textile Industry is cotton based. The strong domestic demand and the revival of the Economic markets by 2009 has led to huge growth of the Indian textiles industry. In December 2010, the domestic cotton price was up by 50% as compared to the December 2009 prices. The causes behind high cotton price are due to the floods in Pakistan and China . India projected a high production of textile (325 lakh bales for 2010 -11).<ref name=\"hindu_trajectory\">{{cite web|last=Back to growth Trajectory|first=textile|title=SURVEY OF INDIAN INDUSTRIES|publisher=Hindu}}</ref> There has been increase in India's share of global textile trading to seven percent in five years.<ref name=\"hindu_trajectory\" /> The rising prices are the major concern of the domestic producers of the country.\n*Man Made Fibres: This includes manufacturing of clothes using fibre or filament synthetic yarns. It is produced in the large power loom factories. They account for the largest sector of the textile production in India. This sector has a share of 62% of the India's total production and provides employment to about 4.8 million people.<ref name=\"indialawoffices\">{{cite web|title=Indian Textiles Industry|url=http://www.indialawoffices.com/pdf/textileindustry.pdf}}</ref>\n*The Cotton Sector: It is the second most developed sector in the Indian Textile industries. It provides employment to a huge number of people but its productions and employment is seasonal depending upon the seasonal nature of the production.\n*The Handloom Sector: It is well developed and is mainly dependent on the SHGs for their funds. Its market share is 13%.<ref name=\"indialawoffices\" /> of the total cloth produced in India.\n*The Woolen Sector: India is the 7th largest producer.<ref name=\"indialawoffices\" /> of the wool in the world. India also produces 1.8% of the world's total wool.\n*The Jute Sector: The jute or the golden fibre in India is mainly produced in the Eastern states of India like Assam and West Bengal. India is the largest producer of jute in the world.\n*The Sericulture and Silk Sector: India is the second largest producer of silk in the world. India produces 18% of the world's total silk. Mulberry, Eri, Tasar, and Muga are the main types of silk produced in the country. It is a labour-intensive sector.\n\n== Cotton textile ==\nIn the early years, the cotton textile industry was concentrated in the cotton growing belt of Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Gujarat. Availability of raw materials, market, transport, labour, moist climate and other factors contributed to localisation. In the early twentieth century, this industry played a huge role in Bombay's economy but soon declined after independence.<ref name=\"BridgeWatson2010\">{{cite book|author1=Gary Bridge|author2=Sophie Watson|title=The Blackwell City Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2aC62fqCyQC&pg=PA75|date=8 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-4051-8983-5|pages=75\u201376}}</ref> While spinning continues to be centralised in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu, weaving is highly decentralised.

Apart from these, there are several thousand small factories with three to ten looms.\n\nIndia exports yarn to Japan, United States, United Kingdom, Russia, France, Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka and other countries. India has the second-largest installed capacity of spindles in the world, with 43.13 million spindles (30 March 2011)<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.citiindia.com/images/database/table5.pdf|title = Installed capacity|date = |accessdate = |website = |last = |first = }}</ref> after China. Although India has a large share in world trade of cotton yarn, its trade in garments is only 4% of the world's total.\n\n== Jute textiles ==\nIndia is the largest producer of raw jute and jute goods and the third largest exporter after Bangladesh. There were about 80 jute mills in India in 2010\u201311, most of which are located in West Bengal, mainly along the banks of the [[Hooghly River]], in a narrow belt (98&nbsp;km long and 3&nbsp;km wide).\n\nIn 2010-2011 the jute industry was supporting 0.37 million workers directly and another 400,000 small and marginal farmers who were engaged in the cultivation of jute.\n\nChallenges faced by the industry include stiff competition in the international market from synthetic substitutes and from other countries such as Bangladesh, Brazil, Philippines, Egypt and Thailand. However, the internal demand has been on the rise due to Government policy of mandatory use of jute packaging. To stimulate demand, the products need to be diversified. In 2005, the National Jute Policy<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.jutecomm.gov.in/NATIONAL%20JUTE%20POLICY%202005.pdf|title = National Jute Policy, 2005|date = |accessdate = |website = |last = Government of India|first = Ministry of Textiles}}</ref> was formulated with the objective of improving quality, increasing productivity and enhancing the yield of the crop.\n\nThe main markets for jute are the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Russia]], [[United Kingdom]] and [[Australia]].\n\n==Ministry of Textile and Industry==\n\nIn 2000, the Government of India passed the National Textile Policy. The major functions of the [[Ministry of Textiles (India)|ministry of textiles]] are formulating policy and coordination of man-made fiber, cotton, jute, silk, wool industries, decentralization of power loom sector, promotion of exports, planning & economic analysis, finance and promoting use of information technology. The advisory boards for the ministry include All India Handlooms Board, All India Handicrafts Board, All India Power looms Board, Advisory Committee under Handlooms Reservation of Articles for Production and Co-ordination Council of Textiles Research Association.

She bettered her personal 72-hole best with 30 strokes and beat the whole Swedish amateur national team, of which some did not even had heard of Neumann before the tournament.

Her victory in the 1994 [[Women's British Open|Women\u2019s British Open]] made her the fifth player to win both British and U.S. Open titles, joining [[Laura Davies]], [[Jane Geddes]], [[Betsy King]] and [[Patty Sheehan]]. This accomplishment was later also achieved by [[Alison Nicholas]], [[Pak Se-ri]], [[Karrie Webb]], [[Inbee Park]] and [[Ariya Jutanugarn]].
