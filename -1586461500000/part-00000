The clade arose from [[Haplogroup R (mtDNA)|haplogroup R]], likely during the early [[Upper Paleolithic]]. Its various subclades (labelled U1&ndash;U9, diverging over the course of the Upper Paleolithic) are found widely distributed across [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia|Central]], [[Western Asia|Western]] and [[South Asia]], as well as [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and the [[Canary Islands]].\n\n==Origins==\nHaplogroup U descends from the [[Haplogroup R (mtDNA)|haplogroup R]] mtDNA branch of the phylogenetic tree. The defining mutations (A11467G, A12308G, G12372A) are estimated to have arisen between 43,000 and 50,000 years ago, in the early [[Upper Paleolithic]] (around 46,530 \u00b1 3,290 years before present, with a 95% [[confidence interval]] per Behar et al., 2012).\n\n[[Ancient DNA]] classified as belonging to the U* mitochondrial haplogroup has been recovered from human skeletal remains found in Western Siberia, which have been dated to c. 45,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Larruga JM, Marrero P, Abu-Amero KK, Golubenko MV, Cabrera VM | title = Carriers of mitochondrial DNA macrohaplogroup R colonized Eurasia and Australasia from a southeast Asia core area | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 115 | date = May 2017 | pmid = 28535779 | pmc = 5442693 | doi = 10.1186/s12862-017-0964-5 }}\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Marrero P, Abu-Amero KK, Larruga JM, Cabrera VM | title = Carriers of human mitochondrial DNA macrohaplogroup M colonized India from southeastern Asia | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 16 | issue = 1 | pages = 246 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27832758 | pmc = 5105315 | doi = 10.1186/s12862-016-0816-8 }}</ref> The mitogenome (33-fold coverage) of the Pe\u015ftera Muierii 1 individual (PM1) from [[Romania]] (35\u2009ky\u2009cal\u2009BP) has been identified as the basal haplogroup U6* not previously found in any ancient or present-day humans.<ref name=Hervella>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hervella M, Svensson EM, Alberdi A, G\u00fcnther T, Izagirre N, Munters AR, Alonso S, Ioana M, Ridiche F, Soficaru A, Jakobsson M, Netea MG, de-la-Rua C | display-authors = 6 | title = The mitogenome of a 35,000-year-old Homo sapiens from Europe supports a Palaeolithic back-migration to Africa | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 6 | pages = 25501 | date = May 2016 | pmid = 27195518 | pmc = 4872530 | doi = 10.1038/srep25501 }}.</ref>\n\nHaplogroup U has been found among [[Iberomaurusian]] specimens dating from the [[Epipaleolithic]] at the [[Taforalt]] and [[Mechta-Afalou|Afalou]] prehistoric sites.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Secher B, Fregel R, Larruga JM, Cabrera VM, Endicott P, Pestano JJ, Gonz\u00e1lez AM | title = The history of the North African mitochondrial DNA haplogroup U6 gene flow into the African, Eurasian and American continents | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 14 | pages = 109 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24885141 | pmc = 4062890 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-14-109 }}</ref> Among the Taforalt individuals, around 13% of the observed haplotypes belonged to various U subclades, including U4a2b (1/24; 4%), U4c1 (1/24; 4%), and U6d3 (1/24; 4%).

In this particular population, lineages specific to parts of Eastern Africa occur as frequently as 39%, which suggests that U9 lineages in [[Pakistan]] may have an [[Africa]]n origin (Quintana-Murci et al. 2004).

Its presence in [[Ethiopia]] and [[Yemen]], together with some Indian-specific M lineages in the Yemeni sample, points to gene flow along the coast of the Arabian Sea. Haplogroups U9 and U4 share two common mutations at the root of their phylogeny. It is interesting that, in Pakistan, U9 occurs frequently only among the so-called [[Siddi|Makrani]] population. In this particular population, lineages specific to parts of Eastern Africa occur as frequently as 39%, which suggests that U9 lineages in [[Pakistan]] may have an [[Africa]]n origin (Quintana-Murci et al. 2004). Regardless of which coast of the Arabian Sea may have been the origin of U9, its Ethiopian\u2013southern Arabian\u2013Indus Basin distribution hints that the subclade's diversification from U4 may have occurred in regions far away from the current area of the highest diversity and frequency of haplogroup U4\u2014East Europe and western Siberia.<ref name=\"U9\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kivisild T, Reidla M, Metspalu E, Rosa A, Brehm A, Pennarun E, Parik J, Geberhiwot T, Usanga E, Villems R | display-authors = 6 | title = Ethiopian mitochondrial DNA heritage: tracking gene flow across and around the gate of tears | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 75 | issue = 5 | pages = 752\u201370 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15457403 | pmc = 1182106 | doi = 10.1086/425161 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Haplogroup U (mtDNA)}}\n* [[Genealogical DNA test]]\n* [[Genetic Genealogy]]\n* [[Human mitochondrial genetics]]\n* [[Population Genetics]]\n*''[[The Seven Daughters of Eve]]''\n\n{{mtDNA}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal | vauthors = Behar DM, van Oven M, Rosset S, Metspalu M, Loogv\u00e4li EL, Silva NM, Kivisild T, Torroni A, Villems R | title = A \"Copernican\" reassessment of the human mitochondrial DNA tree from its root | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 90 | issue = 4 | pages = 675\u201384 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22482806 | pmc = 3322232 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.03.002 }}\n{{Refend}}\n\n== External links ==\n* General\n** Ian Logan's [https://web.archive.org/web/20111209150338/http://www.ianlogan.co.uk/mtDNA.htm Mitochondrial DNA Site]\n** Mannis van Oven's [http://www.phylotree.org Phylotree]\n* Haplogroup U\n** [http://dgmweb.net/genealogy/DNA/DK/DanishDemes-mtDNA-results-HgU.shtml Danish Demes Regional DNA Project:  mtDNA Haplogroup U]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n** [https://web.archive.org/web/20060320201934/https://www3.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/atlas.html?card=mm020 Spread of Haplogroup U], from ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''\n\n[[Category:Human mtDNA haplogroups|U]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toCantabrian(link changed toCantabrian people) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_U_(mtDNA)"}

These, in turn, come from [[Latin]] ''Vasc\u014d'' (pronounced {{IPA-la|\u02c8wasko\u02d0|}}; plural ''[[Vascones|Vasc\u014dnes]]''\u2014see [[#History|history section]] below). The Latin {{IPAslink|w}} generally [[betacism|evolved into]] the [[bilabial]]s {{IPAslink|b}} and {{IPAslink|\u03b2\u031e}} in Gascon and Spanish, probably under the influence of Basque and its relation [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] (the Latin /w/ instead evolved into {{IPAslink|v}} in [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and other [[Romance languages]]).\n\nSeveral coins from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC found in the Basque Country bear the inscription ''barscunes''. The place where they were minted is not certain, but is thought to be somewhere near [[Pamplona]], in the heartland of the area that historians believe was inhabited by the ''Vascones''. Some scholars have suggested a Celtic etymology based on ''bhar-s-'', meaning \"summit\", \"point\" or \"leaves\", according to which ''barscunes'' may have meant \"the [[mountain people]]\", \"the tall ones\" or \"the proud ones\", while others have posited a relationship to a [[proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] root ''*bar-'' meaning \"border\", \"frontier\", \"march\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/130014?idi=en&clave=130014&op=4&primR=1&regs=10&EIKVOGEN=Barscunes&pos=4&epi=120849#mrc1 |title=Vascones - el nombre (Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia) |publisher=Euskomedia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nIn Basque, people call themselves the ''euskaldunak'', singular ''euskaldun'', formed from ''euskal-'' (i.e. \"Basque (language)\") and ''-dun'' (i.e. \"one who has\"); ''euskaldun'' literally means a Basque speaker. Not all Basques are Basque-speakers. Therefore, the [[neologism]] ''euskotar'', plural ''euskotarrak'', was coined in the 19th century to mean a culturally Basque person, whether Basque-speaking or not. Alfonso Irigoyen posits that the word ''euskara'' is derived from an ancient Basque verb ''enautsi'' \"to say\" (cf. modern Basque ''esan'') and the suffix ''-(k)ara'' (\"way (of doing something)\"). Thus ''euskara'' would literally mean \"way of saying\", \"way of speaking\". One item of evidence in favour of this hypothesis is found in the Spanish book ''Compendio Historial'', written in 1571 by the Basque writer [[Esteban de Garibay]]. He records the name of the Basque language as ''enusquera''. It may, however, be a writing mistake.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Basque nationalist activist [[Sabino Arana]] posited an original root ''euzko'' which, he thought, came from ''eguzkiko'' (\"of the sun\", related to the assumption of an original [[Solar deity|solar religion]]). On the basis of this putative root, Arana proposed the name [[Basque Country (greater region)|Euzkadi]] for an independent Basque nation, composed of seven Basque historical territories. Arana's neologism ''Euzkadi'' (in the regularized spelling Euskadi) is still widely used in both Basque and Spanish, since it is now the official name of the [[Autonomous Community]] of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Breve historia de Euskadi : de los fueros a la autonom\u00eda|last=Granja Sainz, Jos\u00e9 Luis de la, 1954-|date=2011|publisher=Debate|others=Pablo, Santiago de., Rubio Pobes, Coro.|isbn=978-84-9992-039-9|edition=1.|location=Madrid|oclc=947160667}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Basque people|Origin of the Basques|Basque Country (greater region)#History}}\n[[File:Bayonne - Arriv\u00e9e des marchandes de sardines - Fonds Ancely - (cropped).jpg|thumb|Basque women in [[Bayonne]]]]\n[[File:Pamplona - Monumento a los Fueros 12.JPG|thumb|upright|Monument to the [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|Charters]] in Pamplona (1903)]]\n[[File:Ulgor.jpg|thumb|Ulgor, earliest nucleus of the cooperative movement and [[Mondragon Corporation|MCC]] (1956)]]\n\nSince the Basque language is unrelated to Indo-European, it has long been thought to represent the people or culture that occupied Europe before the spread of Indo-European languages there.

There is enough evidence to support the hypothesis that at that time and later they spoke old varieties of the Basque language (see: [[Aquitanian language]]).\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages the territory between the [[Ebro]] and [[Garonne]] rivers was known as [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], a vaguely defined ethnic area and political entity struggling to fend off pressure from the Iberian [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kingdom and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Arab rule to the south]], as well as the [[Franks|Frankish]] push from the north.<ref>{{cite book | author = Trask, R.L.| year = 1997 | title= The History of Basque | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lbLbAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA14 | location=New York, USA | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-13116-2 | page = 12}}</ref><ref name=\"Lewis AR 20-33\">{{cite book |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718-1050|last=Lewis |first=Archibald R.|authorlink= Archibald Ross Lewis|year= 1965 |publisher= The University of Texas Press |location=|isbn= |pages=20\u201333|accessdate=2017-10-28|url=http://libro.uca.edu/lewis/sfcatsoc.htm}}</ref> By the turn of the first millennium, the territory of [[Gascony|Vasconia]] had fragmented into different feudal regions, such as [[Soule]] and [[Labourd]], while south of the Pyrenees the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Pamplona|Pamplona]] and the Pyrenean counties of [[County of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Sobrarbe]], [[Ribagor\u00e7a]] (later [[Kingdom of Aragon]]), and [[County of Pallars|Pallars]] emerged as the main regional entities with Basque population in the 9th and 10th centuries.\n\nThe Kingdom of Pamplona, a central Basque realm, later known as [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], underwent a process of feudalization and was subject to the influence of its much larger Aragonese, Castilian and French neighbours. Castile deprived Navarre of its coastline by conquering [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|key western territories]] (1199\u20131201), leaving the kingdom landlocked. The Basques were ravaged by the [[War of the Bands]], bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. Weakened by the Navarrese civil war, the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|bulk of the realm eventually fell]] before the onslaught of the Spanish armies (1512\u20131524). However, [[Lower Navarre|the Navarrese territory north of the Pyrenees]] remained beyond the reach of an increasingly powerful Spain. [[Lower Navarre]] became a province of France in 1620.\n\nNevertheless, the Basques enjoyed a great deal of self-government [[End of Basque home rule in France|until the French Revolution (1790)]] and the [[Carlist Wars]] (1839, 1876), when the Basques supported heir apparent [[Infante Carlos of Spain, Count of Molina|Carlos V]] and his descendants. On either side of the Pyrenees, the Basques [[End of Basque home rule in Spain|lost their native institutions and laws]] held during the ''[[Ancien r\u00e9gime]]''. Since then, despite the current limited self-governing status of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] and Navarre as settled by the Spanish Constitution, many Basques have attempted higher degrees of self-empowerment (see [[Basque nationalism]]), sometimes by acts of violence. [[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]], and [[Soule]] were integrated into the [[Departments of France|French department system]] (starting 1790), with Basque efforts to establish a region-specific political-administrative entity failing to take off to date. However, in January 2017, a single agglomeration community was established for the [[French Basque Country|Basque Country in France]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Garicoix |first=Michel |date=2017-12-29|title=Le Pays basque se constitue en communaut\u00e9 d'agglom\u00e9ration|trans-title=The Basque Country is established as a agglomeration community|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2016/12/29/le-pays-basque-se-constitue-en-communaute-d-agglomeration_5055172_823448.html |language=French |work= |location= |access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Political and administrative divisions===\n[[File:Ekialderantz Urkulutik.JPG|thumb|Mountains of the Basque Country]]\n[[File:Leitza.JPG|thumb|[[Leitza]], in Navarre, Basque Country]]\nThe Basque region is divided into at least three administrative units, namely the [[Basque Autonomous Community]] and [[Navarre]] in Spain, and the [[Arrondissements of France|arrondissement]] of [[Bayonne]] and the [[cantons of France|cantons]] of [[Maul\u00e9on-Licharre]] and [[Tardets-Sorholus]] in the ''[[d\u00e9partement]]'' of [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Atlantiques]], France.\n\nThe autonomous community (a concept established in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]]) known as ''Euskal Autonomia Erkidegoa'' or EAE in Basque and as ''Comunidad Aut\u00f3noma Vasca'' or CAV in Spanish (in English: ''Basque Autonomous Community'' or BAC),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.euskadi.net/euskalterm/ |title=See EUSKALTERM, the Basque Public Term Bank, maintained by the Basque Government for these and other terms and their common translations |publisher=.euskadi.net |accessdate=2010-08-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510193253/http://www1.euskadi.net/euskalterm/ |archivedate=May 10, 2010 }}</ref> is made up of the three Spanish provinces of [[\u00c1lava]], [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]]. The corresponding Basque names of these territories are ''Araba'', ''Bizkaia'' and ''Gipuzkoa'', and their Spanish names are ''\u00c1lava'', ''Vizcaya'' and ''Guip\u00fazcoa''.\n\nThe BAC only includes three of the seven provinces of the currently called historical territories. It is sometimes referred to simply as \"the Basque Country\" (or ''Euskadi'') by writers and public agencies only considering those three western provinces, but also on occasions merely as a convenient abbreviation when this does not lead to confusion in the context. Others reject this usage as inaccurate and are careful to specify the BAC (or an equivalent expression such as \"the three provinces\", up to 1978 referred to as \"Provincias Vascongadas\" in Spanish) when referring to this entity or region. Likewise, terms such as \"the Basque Government\" for \"the government of the BAC\" are commonly though not universally employed. In particular in common usage the French term ''Pays Basque'' (\"Basque Country\"), in the absence of further qualification, refers either to the whole [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] (\"Euskal Herria\" in Basque), or not infrequently to the [[Northern Basque Country|northern (or \"French\") Basque Country]] specifically.\n\nUnder Spain's present constitution, Navarre (''Nafarroa'' in present-day Basque, ''Navarra'' historically in Spanish) constitutes a separate entity, called in present-day Basque ''Nafarroako Foru Erkidegoa'', in Spanish ''Comunidad Foral de Navarra'' (the autonomous community of Navarre). The government of this autonomous community is the Government of Navarre. Note that in historical contexts Navarre may refer to a wider area, and that the present-day northern Basque province of [[Lower Navarre]] may also be referred to as (part of) ''Nafarroa'', while the term \"High Navarre\" (''Nafarroa Garaia'' in Basque, ''Alta Navarra'' in Spanish) is also encountered as a way of referring to the territory of the present-day autonomous community.\n\nThere are three other historic provinces parts of the Basque Country: [[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]] and [[Soule]] (''Lapurdi, Nafarroa Beherea'' and ''Zuberoa'' in Basque; ''Labourd, Basse-Navarre'' and ''Soule'' in French), devoid of official status within France's present-day political and administrative territorial organization, and only minor political support to the Basque nationalists. A large number of regional and local nationalist and non-nationalist representatives have waged a campaign for years advocating for the creation of a separate Basque [[d\u00e9partement]], while these demands have gone unheard by the French administration.\n\n===Population, main cities and languages===\n[[File:Olentzero, Beasain.jpg|thumb|[[Olentzero]] in [[Gipuzkoa]], Basque Country]]\nThere are 2,123,000 people living in the Basque Autonomous Community (279,000 in Alava, 1,160,000 in Biscay and 684,000 in Gipuzkoa). The most important cities in this region, which serve as the provinces' administrative centers, are [[Bilbao]] (in Biscay), [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] (in Gipuzkoa) and [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] (in \u00c1lava). The official languages are Basque and Spanish. Knowledge of Spanish is compulsory under the Spanish constitution (article no. 3), and knowledge and usage of Basque is a right under the Statute of Autonomy (article no. 6), so only knowledge of Spanish is virtually universal. Knowledge of Basque, after declining for many years during [[Spain under Franco|Franco's dictatorship]] owing to official persecution, is again on the rise due to favorable official language policies and popular support. Currently about 33 percent of the population in the Basque Autonomous Community speaks Basque.\n\nNavarre has a population of 601,000; its administrative capital and main city, also regarded by many nationalist Basques as the Basques' historical capital, is Pamplona (''Iru\u00f1ea'' in modern Basque). Only Spanish is an official language of Navarre, and the Basque language is only co-official in the province's northern region, where most Basque-speaking Navarrese are concentrated.\n\nAbout a quarter of a million people live in the [[French Basque Country]]. Nowadays Basque-speakers refer to this region as ''Iparralde'' (Basque for North), and to the Spanish provinces as ''Hegoalde'' (South). Much of this population lives in or near the Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz (BAB) urban belt on the coast (in Basque these are ''Baiona'', ''Angelu'' and ''Miarritze''). The Basque language, which was traditionally spoken by most of the region's population outside the BAB urban zone, is today rapidly losing ground to French. The French Basque Country's lack of self-government within the French state is coupled with the absence of official status for the Basque language in the region. Attempts to introduce bilingualism in local administration have so far met direct refusal from French officials.\n\n==Basque diaspora==\n{{Main|Basque diaspora}}\n[[File:Basque festival in Buenos Aires August 2011.jpg|thumb|Basque festival in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina]]\n[[File:Winnemucca Basque Festival.jpg|thumb|right|Basque festival in [[Winnemucca, Nevada]]]]\nLarge numbers of Basques have left the Basque Country to settle in the rest of Spain, France or other parts of the world in different historical periods, often for economic or political reasons. Historically the Basques abroad were often employed in shepherding and ranching and by maritime fisheries and merchants.

The Basques were important in the mining industry; many were ranchers and vaqueros ([[cowboy]]s), and the rest opened small shops in major cities such as [[Mexico City]], [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]] and [[Puebla]]. In [[Guatemala]], most Basques have been concentrated in [[Sacatepequez Department]], [[Antigua Guatemala]], [[Jalapa Department|Jalapa]] for six generations now, while some have migrated to [[Guatemala City]].\n\nIn Colombia, Basques settled mainly in [[Antioquia Department|Antioquia]] and the [[Colombian coffee growing axis|Coffee Axis]]. It is estimated that nearly 2,500,000 persons from all Antioquia (40% of this [[Departments of Colombia|department]]) have Basque ancestry, as well, in the 19th century about 10% of Colombia's total population were Basque descendants.<ref>http://www.euskomedia.org/PDFAnlt/riev/32/32443444.pdf</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2016}} Antioquia has one of the biggest concentrations of Basques descendants around the world.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In 1955, Joaqu\u00edn Ospina said: \"Is there something more similar to the Basque people than the \"''antioque\u00f1os''\".<ref>http://www.lehendakaritza.ejgv.euskadi.eus/r48-contcvpv/en/contenidos/informacion/03_andres_irujo/en_airujo/adjuntos/antioquia.pdf</ref> Also, writer Arturo Escobar Uribe said in his book \"''Mitos de Antioquia''\" (Myths of Antioquia) (1950): \"Antioquia, which in its clean ascendance predominates the peninsular farmer of the Basque provinces, inherited the virtues of its ancestors...

[[Reno, Nevada]], where the Center for Basque Studies and the Basque Studies Library are located at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]], is another significant nucleus of Basque population. [[Elko, Nevada]] sponsors an annual Basque festival that celebrates the dance, cuisine and cultures of the Basque peoples of Spanish, French and Mexican nationalities who have arrived in [[Nevada]] since the late 19th century.\n\n[[Texas]] has a large percentage of Hispanics descended from Basques who participated in the conquest of [[New Spain]]. Many of the original [[Tejano]]s had Basque blood, including those who fought in the [[Battle of the Alamo]] alongside many of the other Texans. Along the Mexican/Texan border, many Basque surnames can be found. The largest concentration of Basques who settled on Mexico's north-eastern \"frontera\", including the states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Durango]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], and [[Tamaulipas]], also settled along Texas' [[Rio Grande]] from [[South Texas]] to [[West Texas]]. Many of the historic ''hidalgos'', or noble families from this area, had gained their titles and land grants from Spain and Mexico; they still value their land. Some of North America's largest ranches, which were founded under these colonial land grants, can be found in this region.\n\n[[California]] has a major concentration of Basques, most notably in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] between [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]]. The city of Bakersfield has a large Basque community and the city has several Basque restaurants, including Noriega's which won the 2011 James Beard Foundation America's Classic Award. There is a history of Basque culture in [[Chino, California]]. In Chino, two annual Basque festivals celebrate the dance, cuisine, and culture of the peoples. The surrounding area of [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] has many Basque descendants as residents. They are mostly descendants of settlers from Spain and Mexico. These Basques in California are grouped in the group known as ''[[Californio]]s''.\n\nBasques of European Spanish-French and Latin American nationalities also settled throughout the western U.S. in states like [[Louisiana]], [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].\n\n==Culture==\n{{Basque culture}}\n[[File:Lingue vasconum primitiae.gif|thumb|Cover of the first Basque language book, written by Bernard Etxepare]]\n[[File:Nortasun.png|Classification of population according to cultural identity|thumb|Cultural identity according to the 1981 and 1991 census based on the question ''Do you consider yourself Basque?'' &nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;-&nbsp;Yes<br />2&nbsp;-&nbsp;Yes, in some ways &nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;-&nbsp;No<br />4&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don't know / Don't answer]]\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Basque language}}\nThe identifying language of the Basques is called Basque or ''Euskara'', spoken today by 25%-30%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eke.eus/en/kultura/euskara-the-basque-language/basque-sociolinguistics|title=Basque sociolinguistics|publisher=Eke.eus|date=|accessdate=2019-10-21}}</ref> of the region's population. An idea of the central place the language has in cultural terms is given by the fact that Basques identify themselves by the term ''euskaldun'' and their country as ''Euskal Herria'', literally \"Basque speaker\" and \"Country of the Basque Language\" respectively. The language has been made a political issue by official Spanish and French policies restricting its use either historically or currently; however, this has not stopped the teaching, speaking, writing, and cultivating of this increasingly vibrant minority language. This sense of Basque identity tied to the local language does not only exist in isolation. For many Basques, it is juxtaposed with a sense of either Spanish or French identity tied with the use of the Spanish and [[French language]]s among other Basques, especially in the French Basque Country. Regarding the Spanish Basque Country, Basques that don't have a sense of Spanish identity make up an important part of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.noticiasdenavarra.com/2019/01/06/politica/navarra/navarra-es-la-comunidad-con-menor-sentimiento-de-espanolidad}}</ref> As with many European states, a regional identity, be it linguistically derived or otherwise, is not mutually exclusive with the broader national one. For example, Basque [[France national rugby union team|rugby union]] player for France, [[Imanol Harinordoquy]], has said about his national identity:<blockquote>I am French and Basque. There is no conflict, I am proud of both. . . . I have friends who are involved in the political side of things but that is not for me. My only interest is the culture, the Euskera language, the people, our history and ways.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/france/2431544/France-look-to-Basque-prodigy.html |title=France look to Basque prodigy |first=Brendan |last=Gallagher |work=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |date=27 February 2002 |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a result of state language promotion, school policies, the effects of mass media and migration, today virtually all Basques (except for some children below school age) speak the official language of their state (Spanish or French). There are extremely few Basque monolingual speakers: essentially all Basque speakers are bilingual on both sides of the border. Spanish or French is typically the first language of citizens from other regions (who often feel no need to learn Basque), and Spanish or French is also the first language of many Basques, all of which maintains the dominance of the state tongues of both France and Spain. Recent Basque Government policies aim to change this pattern, as they are viewed as potential threats against mainstream usage of the minority tongue.<ref>{{cite web|first=Xabier|last=Aierdi Urraza|url=http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-3693/en/contenidos/informacion/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07/en_integraz/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07.html|title=Routes to linguistic and cultural integration for immigrants in the Basque Autonomous Community|publisher=euskara.euskadi.net|date=24 July 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302214808/http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-3693/en/contenidos/informacion/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07/en_integraz/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07.html|archivedate=2 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Basque language is thought to be a [[genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] [[language isolate]] in contrast with other European languages, almost all of which belong to the broad [[Indo-European language family]].

Basque is also a modern language, and is established as a written and printed one used in present-day forms of publication and communication, as well as a language spoken and used in a very wide range of social and cultural contexts, styles, and registers.\n\n===Land and inheritance===\n[[File:ArangurenDorretxea.jpg|thumb|right|The Aranguren baserri in [[Orozko]], converted from a fortified tower]]\n[[File:BaserriLizarralde.jpg|thumb|right|The Lizarralde baserri ([[Bergara]])]]\nBasques have a close attachment to their home (''etxe(a)'' 'house, home'), especially when this consists of the traditional self-sufficient, family-run farm or ''[[baserri]](a)''. Home in this context is synonymous with family roots. Some [[Basque surnames]] were adapted from old ''baserri'' or [[habitation name]]s. They typically related to a geographical orientation or other locally meaningful identifying features. Such surnames provide even those Basques whose families may have left the land generations ago with an important link to their rural family origins: ''Bengoetxea'' \"the house of further down\", ''Goikoetxea'' \"the house above\", ''Landaburu'' \"top of the field\", ''Errekondo'' \"next to the stream\", ''Elizalde'' \"by the church\", ''Mendizabal'' \"wide hill\", ''Usetxe'' \"house of birds\" ''Ibarretxe'' \"house in the valley\", ''Etxeberria'' \"the new house\", and so on.<ref>[[Koldo Mitxelena|MITXELENA, Koldo]], ''Apellidos vascos'' (fifth edition), San Sebasti\u00e1n: Txertoa, 1997.</ref>\n\nIn contrast to surrounding regions, ancient Basque inheritance patterns, recognised in the ''[[fueros]],'' favoured survival of the unity of inherited land holdings. In a kind of primogeniture, these usually were inherited by the eldest male or female child. As in other cultures, the fate of other family members depended on the assets of a family: wealthy Basque families tended to provide for all children in some way, while less-affluent families may have had only one asset to provide to one child. However, this heir often provided for the rest of the family (unlike in England, with strict primogeniture, where the eldest son inherited everything and often did not provide for others). Even though they were provided for in some way, younger siblings had to make much of their living by other means. Mostly after<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-review-of-social-history/article/pyrenean-marriage-strategies-in-the-nineteenth-century-the-french-basque-case/AE84FEA6BB17C51BC82593FBAD5839BF</ref> the advent of industrialisation, this system resulted in the emigration of many rural Basques to Spain, France or the Americas. Harsh by modern standards, this custom resulted in a great many enterprising figures of Basque origin who went into the world to earn their way, from Spanish [[conquistador]]s such as [[Lope de Aguirre]] and [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]], to explorers, missionaries and saints of the Catholic Church, such as [[Francis Xavier]].\n\nA widespread belief that Basque society was originally [[matriarchal]] is at odds with the current, clearly [[patrilineal]] kinship system and inheritance structures. Some scholars and commentators have attempted to reconcile these points by assuming that patrilineal kinship represents an innovation. In any case, the social position of women in both traditional and modern Basque society is somewhat better than in neighbouring cultures, and women have a substantial influence in decisions about the domestic economy. In the past, some women participated in collective magical ceremonies. They were key participants in a rich folklore, today largely forgotten.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Basque cuisine}}\n[[Basque cuisine]] is at the heart of Basque culture, influenced by the neighboring communities and the excellent produce from the sea and the land. A 20th-century feature of Basque culture is the phenomenon of [[gastronomical society|gastronomical societies]] (called ''[[txoko]]'' in Basque), food clubs where men gather to cook and enjoy their own food. Until recently, women were allowed entry only one day in the year. Cider houses ([[Sagardotegi]]ak) are popular restaurants in Gipuzkoa open for a few months while the cider is in season.\n\n===Cultural production===\n[[File:Artzaiak inudeak 2009 001.jpg|thumb|Artzaiak eta inudeak festival, [[Donostia]], Basque Country.]]\nAt the end of the 20th century, despite [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] violence (ended in 2010) and the crisis of heavy industries, the Basque economic condition recovered remarkably. They emerged from the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime with a revitalized language and culture. The Basque language expanded geographically led by large increases in the major urban centers of Pamplona, Bilbao, and Bayonne, where only a few decades ago the Basque language had all but disappeared. Nowadays, the number of Basque speakers is maintaining its level or increasing slightly.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Basque music}}\n[[File:Basque dance.JPG|thumb|Basque dance]]\n\n===Religion===\nTraditionally Basques have been mostly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. In the 19th century and well into the 20th, Basques as a group remained notably devout and churchgoing. In recent years church attendance has fallen off, as in most of Western Europe. The region has been a source of missionaries like [[Francis Xavier]] and [[Michel Garico\u00efts]]. [[Ignatius Loyola]], founder of the [[Society of Jesus]], was a Basque. [[California]] [[Franciscan]] [[Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n]] was born in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]]. Lasu\u00e9n was the successor to Franciscan Padre [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]] and founded 9 of the 21 extant [[California Missions]] along the coast.\n\nA sprout of [[Protestantism]] in the continental Basque Country produced the first translation of the new Testament into Basque by [[Joanes Leizarraga]]. Queen [[Jeanne III of Navarre]], a devout [[Huguenot]], commissioned the translation of the New Testament into Basque and B\u00e9arnese for the benefit of her subjects. By the time [[Henry IV of France|Henry III of Navarre]] converted to Roman Catholicism in order to become king of France, Protestantism virtually disappeared from the Basque community.\n\n[[Bayonne]] held a Jewish community composed mainly of [[Sephardi Jews]] fleeing from the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s. There were also important Jewish and [[Muslim]] communities in [[Navarre]] before the Castilian invasion of 1512\u201321.\n\nNowadays, according to one single opinion poll, only slightly more than 50% of Basques profess some kind of belief in [[God]], while the rest are either [[agnostic]] or [[atheist]]. The number of religious skeptics increases noticeably for the younger generations, while the older ones are more religious.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb.com/argazki/forum_re/caracterizacion.pdf|title=Opinion poll on religion by GIZAKER|publisher=[[EITB]] the Basque Country's public broadcast service.|accessdate=2010-08-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728103246/http://www.eitb.com/argazki/forum_re/caracterizacion.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-28}}</ref>\n[[Roman Catholicism]] is, by far, the largest religion in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].

There are, broadly speaking, two views. According to one, Christianity arrived in the Basque Country during the 4th and 5th centuries but according to the other, it did not take place until the 12th and 13th centuries. The main issue lies in the different interpretations of what is considered Christianisation. Early traces of Christianity can be found in the major urban areas from the 4th century onwards, a bishopric from 589 in Pamplona and three hermit cave concentrations (two in \u00c1lava, one in Navarre) that were in use from the 6th century onwards. In this sense, Christianity arrived \"early\".\n\nPre-Christian belief seems to have focused on a goddess called [[Mari (goddess)|Mari]]. A number of place-names contain her name, which would suggest these places were related to worship of her such as ''[[Anbotoko Mari]]'' who appears to have been related to the weather. According to one tradition, she travelled every seven years between a cave on Mount [[Anboto]] and one on another mountain (the stories vary); the weather would be wet when she was in Anboto, dry when she was in [[Alo\u00f1a]], or [[Supelegor]], or [[Gorbea]]. One of her names, ''Mari Urraca'' possibly ties her to an historical Navarrese princess of the 11th and 12th century, with other legends giving her a brother or cousin who was a Roman Catholic priest. So far the discussions about whether the name Mari is original and just happened to coincide closely with the Christian name Mar\u00eda or if Mari is an early Basque attempt to give a Christian veneer to pagan worship have remained speculative. At any rate, Mari (Andramari) is one of the oldest worshipped Christian icons in Basque territories.\n\nMari's consort is [[Sugaar]]. This [[chthonic]] couple seems to bear the superior ethical power and the power of creation and destruction. It's said that when they gathered in the high caves of the sacred peaks, they engendered the storms. These meetings typically happened on Friday nights, the day of historical [[Akelarre (witchcraft)|akelarre]] or [[coven]]. Mari was said to reside in Mount [[Anboto]]; periodically she crossed the skies as a bright light to reach her other home at Mount [[Txindoki]].\n\nLegends also speak of many and abundant genies, like ''[[jentilak]]'' (equivalent to [[giant (mythology)|giants]]), ''lamiak'' (equivalent to [[nymph]]s), ''[[mairu]]ak'' (builders of the cromlechs or stone circles, literally [[Moors]]), ''iratxoak'' ([[imp]]s), ''[[sorginak]]'' ([[witch]]es, priestess of Mari), and so on. [[Basajaun]] is a Basque version of the [[Woodwose]]. This character is probably an anthropomorphism of the bear. There is a [[trickster]] named ''[[San Martin Txiki]]'' (\"St Martin the Lesser\").\n\nIt has been shown that some of these stories have entered Basque culture in recent centuries or as part of Roman ''[[superstition]]''. It is unclear whether [[neolithic]] stone structures called [[dolmen]]s have a religious significance or were built to house animals or resting shepherds. Some of the dolmens and [[Stone circles|cromlechs]] are burial sites serving also as border markers.\n[[File:Ioaldunak 001.jpg|thumb|''Ioaldunak'' dancers of Navarre.]]\nThe ''jentilak'' ('[[Giant (mythology)|Giants]]'), on the other hand, are a legendary people which explains the disappearance of a people of [[Stone Age]] culture that used to live in the high lands and with no knowledge of iron. Many legends about them tell that they were bigger and taller, with a great force, but were displaced by the ''ferrons'', or workers of ironworks foundries, until their total fade-out. They were pagans, but one of them, [[Olentzero]], accepted Christianity and became a sort of Basque [[Santa Claus]]. They gave name to several toponyms, as ''[[Jentilbaratza]]''.\n[[File:Weiditz Trachtenbuch 125-126.jpg|thumb|Senior Basque women during the 16th century; the attire was forbidden on [[Pierre de Lancre]]'s intervention in the Basque Country (1609-1612)]]\n\n===Society===\nHistorically, Basque society can be described as being somewhat at odds with Roman and later European societal norms.\n\n[[Strabo]]'s account of the north of Spain in his ''[[Geographica]]'' (written between approximately 20 BC and 20 AD) makes a mention of \"a sort of woman-rule\u2014not at all a mark of civilization\" (Hadington 1992), a first mention of the\u2014for the period\u2014unusual position of women. \"Women could inherit and control property as well as officiate in churches. The evidence for this assertion is rather sparse however.<ref>Kurlansky, Mark. ''The Basque History of the World'' (p.94)</ref>\n\nThis preference for female dominance existed well into the 20th century:\n<blockquote>...[[matrilineal]] inheritance laws, and agricultural work performed by women continued in Basque country until the early twentieth century. For more than a century, scholars have widely discussed the high status of Basque women in law codes, as well as their positions as judges, inheritors, and arbitrators through ante-Roman, medieval, and modern times. The system of laws governing succession in the French Basque region reflected total equality between the sexes. Up until the eve of the French Revolution, the Basque woman was truly \u2018the mistress of the house', hereditary guardian, and head of the lineage.<ref name=\"treilo\">Gimbutas, M. ''The Living Goddesses'' University of California Press: 2001</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile women continued to have a higher position in Basque than other western European societies, it is highly unlikely that any point the society was 'matriarchal', as is often falsely claimed about pre-Indo-European peoples in general. The 'Basque matriarchy' argument is typically tied to 20th century nationalism and is at odds with earlier accounts of the society.<ref>Bullen, Margaret. ''Basque Gender Studies'' (p.118-120)</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[kingdom of Navarre]] did adopt feudalism, most Basques also possessed unusual social institutions different from those of the rest of feudal Europe. Some aspects of this include the [[elizate]] tradition where local house-owners met in front of the church to elect a representative to send to the ''juntas'' and ''[[Juntas Generales]]'' (such as the ''Juntas Generales de Vizcaya'' or ''Guip\u00fazcoa'') which administered much larger areas. Another example was the fact that in the medieval period most land was owned by the farmers, not the Church or a king.<ref name=\"Trask1997\"/>{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}<ref name=\"oprmay\">Collins, R. ''The Basques'' Blackwell: 1986</ref>\n\n==Sports in the Basque Country==\n[[File:LuxioApustua.jpg|thumb|Rivalry and betting in a [[Aizkolaritza|wood-chopping contest (1949)]]]]\n\n===Pelota===\n{{Main|Basque pelota}}\nThe great family of ball games has its unique offspring among Basque ball games, known generically as [[Basque pelota|pilota]] (Spanish: ''pelota''). Some variants have been exported to the United States and [[Macau]] under the name of [[Jai Alai]].\n\n===Rural sports===\n[[File:Remo-ria-de-bilbao.jpg|thumb|''Trainerilla'' in the [[Estuary of Bilbao|Bilbao estuary]]]]\n[[File:20060122 barrenak gora.jpg|thumb|''Barrenatzaileak'' in [[Barakaldo]].]]\n\n{{Main|Basque rural sports}}\nThere are several sports derived by Basques from everyday chores. Heavy workers were challenged and bets placed upon them. Examples are:\n* ''[[estropadak]]'' rowing regattas: from fishermen activities.\n* ''[[Basque rural sports#Sokatira (tug-of-war)|sokatira]]'': tug-of-war.\n* ''[[Harri-jasotzaileak|harri-jasotzea]]'': stone-lifting, from quarry works.\n* ''[[aizkolaritza]]'' and ''[[Basque rural sports#Trontza (sawing)|trontzalaritza]]'': wood-chopping and log sawing.\n* ''[[Basque rural sports#Sega jokoa (scything)|sega jokoa]]'': cutting grass with a [[scythe]].\n* ''[[Basque rural sports#Giza-abere probak (dragging games)|Giza-abere probak]]'': stone block pulling, from construction works:\n** ''[[idi probak]]'' with teams of oxen.\n** ''asto probak'' with donkeys.\n** ''zaldi probak'' with horses.\n** ''gizon probak'' with human teams.\n* ''[[Basque rural sports#Txinga eramatea (weight carrying)|txinga eramatea]]'': carrying of weights, one in each hand, representing milk canisters.\n* ''[[Basque rural sports#Ahari topeka (ram fighting)|ahari topaketa]]: ram fights.\n* ''[[Basque rural sports#Harri zulaketa (hole drilling)|harri zulaketa]]'' competitions: drilling stone blocks with a metal bar, only in the former mining areas of West Biscay.\n* [[Basque rural sports#Txakur probak (sheepdog trials)|Basque sheepdog trials]] competitions.\n\n===Bull runs and bullock games===\nThe [[encierro]] (bull run) in [[Pamplona]]'s [[festival|fiestas]] ''[[San Ferm\u00edn|Sanfermines]]'' started as a transport of bulls to the ring. These encierros, as well as other bull and [[Cattle|bullock]] related activities are not exclusive to Pamplona but are traditional in many towns and villages of the Basque country.\n\n===Football===\n{{Main|Basque Country national football team}}\nThere are several clubs within the Basque Country, such as [[Athletic Bilbao]], [[Real Sociedad]], [[Deportivo Alav\u00e9s]], [[SD Eibar]] and, as Navarre club, the [[CA Osasuna]] (the only club in [[La Liga]] that has a Basque name \u2014 ''osasuna'' means \"health\"). In the 2016\u20132017 season these five clubs played together in La Liga, the first instance where five Basque clubs have reached that level at the same time. Athletic's [[Athletic Bilbao signing policy|recruitment policy]] has meant the club refuses to sign any non-Basque players.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.athletic-club.eus/en/club.html | title = Athletic Club Official Site - Club overview including 'code'}}</ref> Real Sociedad also previously employed such a policy.\n\n===Rugby union===\n[[Rugby union]] is a popular sport among French Basques, with major clubs [[Biarritz Olympique]] and [[Aviron Bayonnais]] traditional powerhouses in the premier division of French Rugby (the [[Top 14]]). Biarritz regularly play [[Heineken Cup]] matches, especially knockout matches, at [[Estadio Anoeta]] in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]]. Games between the Basque clubs and Catalan club [[USA Perpignan]] are always hard fought.\n\n===Professional cycling===\nCycling is popular and the [[Euskaltel-Euskadi]] professional cycling team, partly sponsored by the Basque Government participated in the UCI World Tour division until 2014. Known for their orange tops and hill-climbing ability, their fans were famous for lining the famous Pyrenean climbs in the Tour de France, in support of their compatriots.\n\nEach April the week-long [[Tour of the Basque Country]] showcases the beautiful rolling Basque countryside. [[Miguel Indurain]], born in [[Villava]] is one of the most celebrated cyclists in the world having won 5 consecutive [[Tour de France|Tours de France]].\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Basque Country (greater region)#Politics}}\n[[File:Giza katea, Urbia.JPG|thumb|[[2014 human chain for Basque Country's right to decide]]]]\n[[File:Gure Esku Dago manifestazioa \"Demokrazia\" - Bilbo 2017-19-16 - 9.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in [[Bilbao]] in solidarity with [[2017 Catalan independence referendum|Catalan independence referendum]], September 2017]]\nWhile there is no independent Basque state, Spain's [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of the Basque Country, made up of the provinces of \u00c1lava (Araba), Biscay (Bizkaia) and Gipuzkoa, is primarily a historical consequence and an answer to the wide autonomy claim of its population.\n\nNavarre has a separate statute of autonomy, a contentious arrangement designed during Spanish transition to democracy (the ''Amejoramiento'', an 'upgrade' of its previous status during dictatorship). It refers back to the kingdom status of Navarre (up to 1841) and their traditional institutional and legal framework ([[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|charters]]). Basque, the original and main language of Navarre up to the late 18th century, has kept family transmission especially in the northern part of Navarre and central areas to a lesser extent, designated as Basque speaking or mixed area in Navarrese law. Questions of political, linguistic and cultural allegiance and identity are highly complex in Navarre. Politically some Basque nationalists would like to integrate with the Basque Autonomous Community.\n\nThe [[French Basque Country]] today does not exist as a formal political entity and is officially simply part of the French [[department (country subdivision)|department]] of [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Atlantiques]], centered in [[B\u00e9arn]]. In recent years the number of mayors of the region supporting the creation of a separate Basque department has grown to 63.87%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maire-info.com/territoires/departements/64-des-maires-basques-favorables-un-departement-pays-basque-article-6264 |title=64% des maires basques favorables \u00e0 un d\u00e9partement Pays Basque |date=2 Nov 2005 |publisher=Maire-info.com |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> So far, their attempts have been unsuccessful.\n\n==Political conflicts==\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Basque language}}\n{{See also|Basque Country (greater region)#Language}}\n\nBoth the Spanish and French governments have, at times, suppressed Basque [[natural language|linguistic]] and cultural identity. The [[French Republics (disambiguation)|French Republics]], the epitome of the [[nation-state]], have a long history of attempting the complete cultural absorption of cultural minority groups. Spain has, at most points in its history, granted some degree of linguistic, cultural, and even political autonomy to its Basques, but under the [[Spain under Franco|regime of Francisco Franco]], the Spanish government reversed the advances of Basque nationalism, as it had fought in the opposite side of the [[Spanish Civil War]]: cultural activity in Basque was limited to folkloric issues and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nToday, the [[Southern Basque Country]] within Spain enjoys an extensive cultural and political autonomy. The majority of schools under the jurisdiction of the [[Basque education system]] use Basque as the primary medium of teaching. However, the situation is more delicate in the [[French Basque Country|Northern Basque Country]] within France, where Basque is not officially recognized, and where lack of autonomy and monolingual public schooling in French exert great pressure on the Basque language.\n\nIn Navarre, Basque has been declared an endangered language, since the anti-Basque and conservative government of [[Navarrese People's Union]] opposes the symbols of Basque culture,<ref>Resolution of the General Assembly of the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages, 13 September 2003 (Helsinki), on the situation of the Basque language in the Autonomous Community of Navarre. Reported in MERCATOR Butlleti 55: \"Speakers of a regional or minority language should have the right to use their language in private and public life. Contrary to these principles, local authorities from Iru\u00f1a/Pamplona (capital city of the Autonomous Community of [[Navarre]] in Spain) have been implementing a series of reforms to the Autonomous Community legislation limiting the use of the Basque language. Basque is the only endangered language in the Autonomous Community of Navarre...\"</ref> highlighting a Spanish identity for Navarre.\n\nBasque is also spoken by immigrants in the major cities of Spain and France, in [[Australia]], in many parts of [[Latin America]], and in the [[United States]], especially in Nevada, Idaho, and California.<ref name=\"Trask1997\"/>{{rp|1}}\n\n===Political status and violence===\n[[File:Muralbelfast2.jpg|thumb|A republican mural in [[Belfast]] showing solidarity with [[Basque nationalism]].]]\n\nSince its articulation by Sabino Arana in the late 19th century, the more radical currents of [[Basque nationalism]] have demanded the right of [[self-determination]] and even [[independence]]. Within the Basque country, this element of Basque politics is often in balance with the conception of the Basque Country as just another part of the Spanish state, a view more commonly espoused on the right of the political spectrum. In contrast, the desire for greater autonomy or independence is particularly common among [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Basque nationalists. The right of self-determination was asserted by the [[Basque Parliament]] in 2002 and 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb24.com/portal/eitb24/noticia/en/politics/pp-and-pse-voted-against-basque-parliament-adopts-resolution-on-s?itemId=B24_18787&cl=%2Feitb24%2Fpolitica&idioma=en |title=EITB: ''Basque parliament adopts resolution on self-determination'' |publisher=Eitb24.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}</ref>\nSince self-determination is not recognized in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], a wide majority of Basques abstained (55%) and some even voted against it (23.5%) in the ratification referendum of December 6 of that year. However, it was approved by clear [[majority]] overall in Spanish (87%). The autonomous regime for the Basque Country was approved in a 1979 referendum but the autonomy of Navarre (''Amejoramiento del Fuero'': \"improvement of the charter\") was never subject to a referendum but only approved by the Navarrese Cortes (parliament).\n\n====Political violence====\n{{Main|Basque conflict}}\n{{See also|ETA (separatist group)|Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci\u00f3n|Batall\u00f3n Vasco Espa\u00f1ol|Comandos Aut\u00f3nomos Anticapitalistas|Iraultza}}\n{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}\n\n==Classification==\nAs with their language, the Basques are clearly a distinct cultural group in their region.

Surrounded by [[Romance languages|Romance-language]] speakers, the Basques traditionally spoke (and many still speak) a language that was not only non-Romance but non-Indo-European. The prevailing belief amongst Basques, and forming part of their national identity, is that their language has continuity with the people who were in this region since not only pre-Roman and pre-Celtic times, but since the Stone Age.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:06_laiatzen.jpg|thumb|Basque peasants [[Laia (tool)|ploughing]]]]\nIn 1920, [[H. G. Wells]] referred to the [[Mediterranean race]] as the ''Iberian race''. He regarded it as a fourth subrace of the Caucasian race, along with the ''Aryan'', ''Semitic'', and ''Hamitic'' subraces. He stated that the main [[ethnic group]] that most purely represented the racial stock of the Iberian race was the Basques, and that the Basques were the descendants of the [[Cro-Magnons]].<ref>Wells, H.

Additionally, the Basque population has virtually no [[ABO blood group system|B blood type]], nor the related AB type. They have a high rate of O blood group but this is probably due to isolation.\n\nAlthough they are genetically distinctive in some ways, the Basques are still very typically European in terms of their [[Y-DNA]] and [[mtDNA]] sequences, and in terms of some other genetic [[Locus (genetics)|loci]].

These, in turn, come from [[Latin]] ''Vasc\u014d'' (pronounced {{IPA-la|\u02c8wasko\u02d0|}}; plural ''[[Vascones|Vasc\u014dnes]]''\u2014see [[#History|history section]] below). The Latin {{IPAslink|w}} generally [[betacism|evolved into]] the [[bilabial]]s {{IPAslink|b}} and {{IPAslink|\u03b2\u031e}} in Gascon and Spanish, probably under the influence of Basque and its relation [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] (the Latin /w/ instead evolved into {{IPAslink|v}} in [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and other [[Romance languages]]).\n\nSeveral coins from the 2nd and 1st centuries BC found in the Basque Country bear the inscription ''barscunes''. The place where they were minted is not certain, but is thought to be somewhere near [[Pamplona]], in the heartland of the area that historians believe was inhabited by the ''Vascones''. Some scholars have suggested a Celtic etymology based on ''bhar-s-'', meaning \"summit\", \"point\" or \"leaves\", according to which ''barscunes'' may have meant \"the [[mountain people]]\", \"the tall ones\" or \"the proud ones\", while others have posited a relationship to a [[proto-Indo-European language|proto-Indo-European]] root ''*bar-'' meaning \"border\", \"frontier\", \"march\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euskomedia.org/aunamendi/130014?idi=en&clave=130014&op=4&primR=1&regs=10&EIKVOGEN=Barscunes&pos=4&epi=120849#mrc1 |title=Vascones - el nombre (Au\u00f1amendi Encyclopedia) |publisher=Euskomedia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>\n\nIn Basque, people call themselves the ''euskaldunak'', singular ''euskaldun'', formed from ''euskal-'' (i.e. \"Basque (language)\") and ''-dun'' (i.e. \"one who has\"); ''euskaldun'' literally means a Basque speaker. Not all Basques are Basque-speakers. Therefore, the [[neologism]] ''euskotar'', plural ''euskotarrak'', was coined in the 19th century to mean a culturally Basque person, whether Basque-speaking or not. Alfonso Irigoyen posits that the word ''euskara'' is derived from an ancient Basque verb ''enautsi'' \"to say\" (cf. modern Basque ''esan'') and the suffix ''-(k)ara'' (\"way (of doing something)\"). Thus ''euskara'' would literally mean \"way of saying\", \"way of speaking\". One item of evidence in favour of this hypothesis is found in the Spanish book ''Compendio Historial'', written in 1571 by the Basque writer [[Esteban de Garibay]]. He records the name of the Basque language as ''enusquera''. It may, however, be a writing mistake.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Basque nationalist activist [[Sabino Arana]] posited an original root ''euzko'' which, he thought, came from ''eguzkiko'' (\"of the sun\", related to the assumption of an original [[Solar deity|solar religion]]). On the basis of this putative root, Arana proposed the name [[Basque Country (greater region)|Euzkadi]] for an independent Basque nation, composed of seven Basque historical territories. Arana's neologism ''Euzkadi'' (in the regularized spelling Euskadi) is still widely used in both Basque and Spanish, since it is now the official name of the [[Autonomous Community]] of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Breve historia de Euskadi : de los fueros a la autonom\u00eda|last=Granja Sainz, Jos\u00e9 Luis de la, 1954-|date=2011|publisher=Debate|others=Pablo, Santiago de., Rubio Pobes, Coro.|isbn=978-84-9992-039-9|edition=1.|location=Madrid|oclc=947160667}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of the Basque people|Origin of the Basques|Basque Country (greater region)#History}}\n[[File:Bayonne - Arriv\u00e9e des marchandes de sardines - Fonds Ancely - (cropped).jpg|thumb|Basque women in [[Bayonne]]]]\n[[File:Pamplona - Monumento a los Fueros 12.JPG|thumb|upright|Monument to the [[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|Charters]] in Pamplona (1903)]]\n[[File:Ulgor.jpg|thumb|Ulgor, earliest nucleus of the cooperative movement and [[Mondragon Corporation|MCC]] (1956)]]\n\nSince the Basque language is unrelated to Indo-European, it has long been thought to represent the people or culture that occupied Europe before the spread of Indo-European languages there.

There is enough evidence to support the hypothesis that at that time and later they spoke old varieties of the Basque language (see: [[Aquitanian language]]).\n\nIn the Early Middle Ages the territory between the [[Ebro]] and [[Garonne]] rivers was known as [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], a vaguely defined ethnic area and political entity struggling to fend off pressure from the Iberian [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] kingdom and [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Arab rule to the south]], as well as the [[Franks|Frankish]] push from the north.<ref>{{cite book | author = Trask, R.L.| year = 1997 | title= The History of Basque | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lbLbAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA14 | location=New York, USA | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 0-415-13116-2 | page = 12}}</ref><ref name=\"Lewis AR 20-33\">{{cite book |title=The Development of Southern French and Catalan Society, 718-1050|last=Lewis |first=Archibald R.|authorlink= Archibald Ross Lewis|year= 1965 |publisher= The University of Texas Press |location=|isbn= |pages=20\u201333|accessdate=2017-10-28|url=http://libro.uca.edu/lewis/sfcatsoc.htm}}</ref> By the turn of the first millennium, the territory of [[Gascony|Vasconia]] had fragmented into different feudal regions, such as [[Soule]] and [[Labourd]], while south of the Pyrenees the [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Pamplona|Pamplona]] and the Pyrenean counties of [[County of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Sobrarbe]], [[Ribagor\u00e7a]] (later [[Kingdom of Aragon]]), and [[County of Pallars|Pallars]] emerged as the main regional entities with Basque population in the 9th and 10th centuries.\n\nThe Kingdom of Pamplona, a central Basque realm, later known as [[Kingdom of Navarre|Navarre]], underwent a process of feudalization and was subject to the influence of its much larger Aragonese, Castilian and French neighbours. Castile deprived Navarre of its coastline by conquering [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|key western territories]] (1199\u20131201), leaving the kingdom landlocked. The Basques were ravaged by the [[War of the Bands]], bitter partisan wars between local ruling families. Weakened by the Navarrese civil war, the [[Spanish conquest of Iberian Navarre|bulk of the realm eventually fell]] before the onslaught of the Spanish armies (1512\u20131524). However, [[Lower Navarre|the Navarrese territory north of the Pyrenees]] remained beyond the reach of an increasingly powerful Spain. [[Lower Navarre]] became a province of France in 1620.\n\nNevertheless, the Basques enjoyed a great deal of self-government [[End of Basque home rule in France|until the French Revolution (1790)]] and the [[Carlist Wars]] (1839, 1876), when the Basques supported heir apparent [[Infante Carlos of Spain, Count of Molina|Carlos V]] and his descendants. On either side of the Pyrenees, the Basques [[End of Basque home rule in Spain|lost their native institutions and laws]] held during the ''[[Ancien r\u00e9gime]]''. Since then, despite the current limited self-governing status of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Autonomous Community]] and Navarre as settled by the Spanish Constitution, many Basques have attempted higher degrees of self-empowerment (see [[Basque nationalism]]), sometimes by acts of violence. [[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]], and [[Soule]] were integrated into the [[Departments of France|French department system]] (starting 1790), with Basque efforts to establish a region-specific political-administrative entity failing to take off to date.

The corresponding Basque names of these territories are ''Araba'', ''Bizkaia'' and ''Gipuzkoa'', and their Spanish names are ''\u00c1lava'', ''Vizcaya'' and ''Guip\u00fazcoa''.\n\nThe BAC only includes three of the seven provinces of the currently called historical territories. It is sometimes referred to simply as \"the Basque Country\" (or ''Euskadi'') by writers and public agencies only considering those three western provinces, but also on occasions merely as a convenient abbreviation when this does not lead to confusion in the context. Others reject this usage as inaccurate and are careful to specify the BAC (or an equivalent expression such as \"the three provinces\", up to 1978 referred to as \"Provincias Vascongadas\" in Spanish) when referring to this entity or region. Likewise, terms such as \"the Basque Government\" for \"the government of the BAC\" are commonly though not universally employed. In particular in common usage the French term ''Pays Basque'' (\"Basque Country\"), in the absence of further qualification, refers either to the whole [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]] (\"Euskal Herria\" in Basque), or not infrequently to the [[Northern Basque Country|northern (or \"French\") Basque Country]] specifically.\n\nUnder Spain's present constitution, Navarre (''Nafarroa'' in present-day Basque, ''Navarra'' historically in Spanish) constitutes a separate entity, called in present-day Basque ''Nafarroako Foru Erkidegoa'', in Spanish ''Comunidad Foral de Navarra'' (the autonomous community of Navarre). The government of this autonomous community is the Government of Navarre. Note that in historical contexts Navarre may refer to a wider area, and that the present-day northern Basque province of [[Lower Navarre]] may also be referred to as (part of) ''Nafarroa'', while the term \"High Navarre\" (''Nafarroa Garaia'' in Basque, ''Alta Navarra'' in Spanish) is also encountered as a way of referring to the territory of the present-day autonomous community.\n\nThere are three other historic provinces parts of the Basque Country: [[Labourd]], [[Lower Navarre]] and [[Soule]] (''Lapurdi, Nafarroa Beherea'' and ''Zuberoa'' in Basque; ''Labourd, Basse-Navarre'' and ''Soule'' in French), devoid of official status within France's present-day political and administrative territorial organization, and only minor political support to the Basque nationalists. A large number of regional and local nationalist and non-nationalist representatives have waged a campaign for years advocating for the creation of a separate Basque [[d\u00e9partement]], while these demands have gone unheard by the French administration.\n\n===Population, main cities and languages===\n[[File:Olentzero, Beasain.jpg|thumb|[[Olentzero]] in [[Gipuzkoa]], Basque Country]]\nThere are 2,123,000 people living in the Basque Autonomous Community (279,000 in Alava, 1,160,000 in Biscay and 684,000 in Gipuzkoa). The most important cities in this region, which serve as the provinces' administrative centers, are [[Bilbao]] (in Biscay), [[San Sebasti\u00e1n]] (in Gipuzkoa) and [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]] (in \u00c1lava). The official languages are Basque and Spanish. Knowledge of Spanish is compulsory under the Spanish constitution (article no. 3), and knowledge and usage of Basque is a right under the Statute of Autonomy (article no. 6), so only knowledge of Spanish is virtually universal. Knowledge of Basque, after declining for many years during [[Spain under Franco|Franco's dictatorship]] owing to official persecution, is again on the rise due to favorable official language policies and popular support. Currently about 33 percent of the population in the Basque Autonomous Community speaks Basque.\n\nNavarre has a population of 601,000; its administrative capital and main city, also regarded by many nationalist Basques as the Basques' historical capital, is Pamplona (''Iru\u00f1ea'' in modern Basque). Only Spanish is an official language of Navarre, and the Basque language is only co-official in the province's northern region, where most Basque-speaking Navarrese are concentrated.\n\nAbout a quarter of a million people live in the [[French Basque Country]]. Nowadays Basque-speakers refer to this region as ''Iparralde'' (Basque for North), and to the Spanish provinces as ''Hegoalde'' (South). Much of this population lives in or near the Bayonne-Anglet-Biarritz (BAB) urban belt on the coast (in Basque these are ''Baiona'', ''Angelu'' and ''Miarritze''). The Basque language, which was traditionally spoken by most of the region's population outside the BAB urban zone, is today rapidly losing ground to French. The French Basque Country's lack of self-government within the French state is coupled with the absence of official status for the Basque language in the region. Attempts to introduce bilingualism in local administration have so far met direct refusal from French officials.\n\n==Basque diaspora==\n{{Main|Basque diaspora}}\n[[File:Basque festival in Buenos Aires August 2011.jpg|thumb|Basque festival in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina]]\n[[File:Winnemucca Basque Festival.jpg|thumb|right|Basque festival in [[Winnemucca, Nevada]]]]\nLarge numbers of Basques have left the Basque Country to settle in the rest of Spain, France or other parts of the world in different historical periods, often for economic or political reasons.

[[Reno, Nevada]], where the Center for Basque Studies and the Basque Studies Library are located at the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]], is another significant nucleus of Basque population. [[Elko, Nevada]] sponsors an annual Basque festival that celebrates the dance, cuisine and cultures of the Basque peoples of Spanish, French and Mexican nationalities who have arrived in [[Nevada]] since the late 19th century.\n\n[[Texas]] has a large percentage of Hispanics descended from Basques who participated in the conquest of [[New Spain]]. Many of the original [[Tejano]]s had Basque blood, including those who fought in the [[Battle of the Alamo]] alongside many of the other Texans. Along the Mexican/Texan border, many Basque surnames can be found. The largest concentration of Basques who settled on Mexico's north-eastern \"frontera\", including the states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Durango]], [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo Le\u00f3n]], and [[Tamaulipas]], also settled along Texas' [[Rio Grande]] from [[South Texas]] to [[West Texas]]. Many of the historic ''hidalgos'', or noble families from this area, had gained their titles and land grants from Spain and Mexico; they still value their land. Some of North America's largest ranches, which were founded under these colonial land grants, can be found in this region.\n\n[[California]] has a major concentration of Basques, most notably in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] between [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]]. The city of Bakersfield has a large Basque community and the city has several Basque restaurants, including Noriega's which won the 2011 James Beard Foundation America's Classic Award. There is a history of Basque culture in [[Chino, California]]. In Chino, two annual Basque festivals celebrate the dance, cuisine, and culture of the peoples. The surrounding area of [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] has many Basque descendants as residents. They are mostly descendants of settlers from Spain and Mexico. These Basques in California are grouped in the group known as ''[[Californio]]s''.\n\nBasques of European Spanish-French and Latin American nationalities also settled throughout the western U.S. in states like [[Louisiana]], [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], [[Wyoming]], [[Montana]], [[Oregon]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].\n\n==Culture==\n{{Basque culture}}\n[[File:Lingue vasconum primitiae.gif|thumb|Cover of the first Basque language book, written by Bernard Etxepare]]\n[[File:Nortasun.png|Classification of population according to cultural identity|thumb|Cultural identity according to the 1981 and 1991 census based on the question ''Do you consider yourself Basque?'' &nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;-&nbsp;Yes<br />2&nbsp;-&nbsp;Yes, in some ways &nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;-&nbsp;No<br />4&nbsp;-&nbsp;Don't know / Don't answer]]\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Basque language}}\nThe identifying language of the Basques is called Basque or ''Euskara'', spoken today by 25%-30%<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eke.eus/en/kultura/euskara-the-basque-language/basque-sociolinguistics|title=Basque sociolinguistics|publisher=Eke.eus|date=|accessdate=2019-10-21}}</ref> of the region's population. An idea of the central place the language has in cultural terms is given by the fact that Basques identify themselves by the term ''euskaldun'' and their country as ''Euskal Herria'', literally \"Basque speaker\" and \"Country of the Basque Language\" respectively. The language has been made a political issue by official Spanish and French policies restricting its use either historically or currently; however, this has not stopped the teaching, speaking, writing, and cultivating of this increasingly vibrant minority language. This sense of Basque identity tied to the local language does not only exist in isolation. For many Basques, it is juxtaposed with a sense of either Spanish or French identity tied with the use of the Spanish and [[French language]]s among other Basques, especially in the French Basque Country. Regarding the Spanish Basque Country, Basques that don't have a sense of Spanish identity make up an important part of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.noticiasdenavarra.com/2019/01/06/politica/navarra/navarra-es-la-comunidad-con-menor-sentimiento-de-espanolidad}}</ref> As with many European states, a regional identity, be it linguistically derived or otherwise, is not mutually exclusive with the broader national one. For example, Basque [[France national rugby union team|rugby union]] player for France, [[Imanol Harinordoquy]], has said about his national identity:<blockquote>I am French and Basque. There is no conflict, I am proud of both. . . . I have friends who are involved in the political side of things but that is not for me. My only interest is the culture, the Euskera language, the people, our history and ways.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/france/2431544/France-look-to-Basque-prodigy.html |title=France look to Basque prodigy |first=Brendan |last=Gallagher |work=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |date=27 February 2002 |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a result of state language promotion, school policies, the effects of mass media and migration, today virtually all Basques (except for some children below school age) speak the official language of their state (Spanish or French). There are extremely few Basque monolingual speakers: essentially all Basque speakers are bilingual on both sides of the border. Spanish or French is typically the first language of citizens from other regions (who often feel no need to learn Basque), and Spanish or French is also the first language of many Basques, all of which maintains the dominance of the state tongues of both France and Spain. Recent Basque Government policies aim to change this pattern, as they are viewed as potential threats against mainstream usage of the minority tongue.<ref>{{cite web|first=Xabier|last=Aierdi Urraza|url=http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-3693/en/contenidos/informacion/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07/en_integraz/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07.html|title=Routes to linguistic and cultural integration for immigrants in the Basque Autonomous Community|publisher=euskara.euskadi.net|date=24 July 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302214808/http://www.euskara.euskadi.net/r59-3693/en/contenidos/informacion/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07/en_integraz/artik9_1_integrazioa_06_07.html|archivedate=2 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Basque language is thought to be a [[genetic (linguistics)|genetic]] [[language isolate]] in contrast with other European languages, almost all of which belong to the broad [[Indo-European language family]].

In a kind of primogeniture, these usually were inherited by the eldest male or female child. As in other cultures, the fate of other family members depended on the assets of a family: wealthy Basque families tended to provide for all children in some way, while less-affluent families may have had only one asset to provide to one child. However, this heir often provided for the rest of the family (unlike in England, with strict primogeniture, where the eldest son inherited everything and often did not provide for others). Even though they were provided for in some way, younger siblings had to make much of their living by other means. Mostly after<ref>https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-review-of-social-history/article/pyrenean-marriage-strategies-in-the-nineteenth-century-the-french-basque-case/AE84FEA6BB17C51BC82593FBAD5839BF</ref> the advent of industrialisation, this system resulted in the emigration of many rural Basques to Spain, France or the Americas. Harsh by modern standards, this custom resulted in a great many enterprising figures of Basque origin who went into the world to earn their way, from Spanish [[conquistador]]s such as [[Lope de Aguirre]] and [[Francisco V\u00e1squez de Coronado]], to explorers, missionaries and saints of the Catholic Church, such as [[Francis Xavier]].\n\nA widespread belief that Basque society was originally [[matriarchal]] is at odds with the current, clearly [[patrilineal]] kinship system and inheritance structures. Some scholars and commentators have attempted to reconcile these points by assuming that patrilineal kinship represents an innovation. In any case, the social position of women in both traditional and modern Basque society is somewhat better than in neighbouring cultures, and women have a substantial influence in decisions about the domestic economy. In the past, some women participated in collective magical ceremonies. They were key participants in a rich folklore, today largely forgotten.\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Basque cuisine}}\n[[Basque cuisine]] is at the heart of Basque culture, influenced by the neighboring communities and the excellent produce from the sea and the land. A 20th-century feature of Basque culture is the phenomenon of [[gastronomical society|gastronomical societies]] (called ''[[txoko]]'' in Basque), food clubs where men gather to cook and enjoy their own food. Until recently, women were allowed entry only one day in the year. Cider houses ([[Sagardotegi]]ak) are popular restaurants in Gipuzkoa open for a few months while the cider is in season.\n\n===Cultural production===\n[[File:Artzaiak inudeak 2009 001.jpg|thumb|Artzaiak eta inudeak festival, [[Donostia]], Basque Country.]]\nAt the end of the 20th century, despite [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] violence (ended in 2010) and the crisis of heavy industries, the Basque economic condition recovered remarkably. They emerged from the [[Francisco Franco|Franco]] regime with a revitalized language and culture. The Basque language expanded geographically led by large increases in the major urban centers of Pamplona, Bilbao, and Bayonne, where only a few decades ago the Basque language had all but disappeared. Nowadays, the number of Basque speakers is maintaining its level or increasing slightly.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Basque music}}\n[[File:Basque dance.JPG|thumb|Basque dance]]\n\n===Religion===\nTraditionally Basques have been mostly [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]]. In the 19th century and well into the 20th, Basques as a group remained notably devout and churchgoing. In recent years church attendance has fallen off, as in most of Western Europe. The region has been a source of missionaries like [[Francis Xavier]] and [[Michel Garico\u00efts]]. [[Ignatius Loyola]], founder of the [[Society of Jesus]], was a Basque. [[California]] [[Franciscan]] [[Ferm\u00edn Lasu\u00e9n]] was born in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]]. Lasu\u00e9n was the successor to Franciscan Padre [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]] and founded 9 of the 21 extant [[California Missions]] along the coast.\n\nA sprout of [[Protestantism]] in the continental Basque Country produced the first translation of the new Testament into Basque by [[Joanes Leizarraga]]. Queen [[Jeanne III of Navarre]], a devout [[Huguenot]], commissioned the translation of the New Testament into Basque and B\u00e9arnese for the benefit of her subjects. By the time [[Henry IV of France|Henry III of Navarre]] converted to Roman Catholicism in order to become king of France, Protestantism virtually disappeared from the Basque community.\n\n[[Bayonne]] held a Jewish community composed mainly of [[Sephardi Jews]] fleeing from the [[Spanish Inquisition|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Inquisition]]s. There were also important Jewish and [[Muslim]] communities in [[Navarre]] before the Castilian invasion of 1512\u201321.\n\nNowadays, according to one single opinion poll, only slightly more than 50% of Basques profess some kind of belief in [[God]], while the rest are either [[agnostic]] or [[atheist]]. The number of religious skeptics increases noticeably for the younger generations, while the older ones are more religious.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb.com/argazki/forum_re/caracterizacion.pdf|title=Opinion poll on religion by GIZAKER|publisher=[[EITB]] the Basque Country's public broadcast service.|accessdate=2010-08-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728103246/http://www.eitb.com/argazki/forum_re/caracterizacion.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-28}}</ref>\n[[Roman Catholicism]] is, by far, the largest religion in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]].

There are, broadly speaking, two views. According to one, Christianity arrived in the Basque Country during the 4th and 5th centuries but according to the other, it did not take place until the 12th and 13th centuries. The main issue lies in the different interpretations of what is considered Christianisation. Early traces of Christianity can be found in the major urban areas from the 4th century onwards, a bishopric from 589 in Pamplona and three hermit cave concentrations (two in \u00c1lava, one in Navarre) that were in use from the 6th century onwards. In this sense, Christianity arrived \"early\".\n\nPre-Christian belief seems to have focused on a goddess called [[Mari (goddess)|Mari]]. A number of place-names contain her name, which would suggest these places were related to worship of her such as ''[[Anbotoko Mari]]'' who appears to have been related to the weather. According to one tradition, she travelled every seven years between a cave on Mount [[Anboto]] and one on another mountain (the stories vary); the weather would be wet when she was in Anboto, dry when she was in [[Alo\u00f1a]], or [[Supelegor]], or [[Gorbea]]. One of her names, ''Mari Urraca'' possibly ties her to an historical Navarrese princess of the 11th and 12th century, with other legends giving her a brother or cousin who was a Roman Catholic priest. So far the discussions about whether the name Mari is original and just happened to coincide closely with the Christian name Mar\u00eda or if Mari is an early Basque attempt to give a Christian veneer to pagan worship have remained speculative. At any rate, Mari (Andramari) is one of the oldest worshipped Christian icons in Basque territories.\n\nMari's consort is [[Sugaar]]. This [[chthonic]] couple seems to bear the superior ethical power and the power of creation and destruction. It's said that when they gathered in the high caves of the sacred peaks, they engendered the storms. These meetings typically happened on Friday nights, the day of historical [[Akelarre (witchcraft)|akelarre]] or [[coven]]. Mari was said to reside in Mount [[Anboto]]; periodically she crossed the skies as a bright light to reach her other home at Mount [[Txindoki]].\n\nLegends also speak of many and abundant genies, like ''[[jentilak]]'' (equivalent to [[giant (mythology)|giants]]), ''lamiak'' (equivalent to [[nymph]]s), ''[[mairu]]ak'' (builders of the cromlechs or stone circles, literally [[Moors]]), ''iratxoak'' ([[imp]]s), ''[[sorginak]]'' ([[witch]]es, priestess of Mari), and so on. [[Basajaun]] is a Basque version of the [[Woodwose]]. This character is probably an anthropomorphism of the bear. There is a [[trickster]] named ''[[San Martin Txiki]]'' (\"St Martin the Lesser\").\n\nIt has been shown that some of these stories have entered Basque culture in recent centuries or as part of Roman ''[[superstition]]''. It is unclear whether [[neolithic]] stone structures called [[dolmen]]s have a religious significance or were built to house animals or resting shepherds. Some of the dolmens and [[Stone circles|cromlechs]] are burial sites serving also as border markers.\n[[File:Ioaldunak 001.jpg|thumb|''Ioaldunak'' dancers of Navarre.]]\nThe ''jentilak'' ('[[Giant (mythology)|Giants]]'), on the other hand, are a legendary people which explains the disappearance of a people of [[Stone Age]] culture that used to live in the high lands and with no knowledge of iron. Many legends about them tell that they were bigger and taller, with a great force, but were displaced by the ''ferrons'', or workers of ironworks foundries, until their total fade-out. They were pagans, but one of them, [[Olentzero]], accepted Christianity and became a sort of Basque [[Santa Claus]]. They gave name to several toponyms, as ''[[Jentilbaratza]]''.\n[[File:Weiditz Trachtenbuch 125-126.jpg|thumb|Senior Basque women during the 16th century; the attire was forbidden on [[Pierre de Lancre]]'s intervention in the Basque Country (1609-1612)]]\n\n===Society===\nHistorically, Basque society can be described as being somewhat at odds with Roman and later European societal norms.\n\n[[Strabo]]'s account of the north of Spain in his ''[[Geographica]]'' (written between approximately 20 BC and 20 AD) makes a mention of \"a sort of woman-rule\u2014not at all a mark of civilization\" (Hadington 1992), a first mention of the\u2014for the period\u2014unusual position of women. \"Women could inherit and control property as well as officiate in churches. The evidence for this assertion is rather sparse however.<ref>Kurlansky, Mark. ''The Basque History of the World'' (p.94)</ref>\n\nThis preference for female dominance existed well into the 20th century:\n<blockquote>...[[matrilineal]] inheritance laws, and agricultural work performed by women continued in Basque country until the early twentieth century. For more than a century, scholars have widely discussed the high status of Basque women in law codes, as well as their positions as judges, inheritors, and arbitrators through ante-Roman, medieval, and modern times. The system of laws governing succession in the French Basque region reflected total equality between the sexes. Up until the eve of the French Revolution, the Basque woman was truly \u2018the mistress of the house', hereditary guardian, and head of the lineage.<ref name=\"treilo\">Gimbutas, M. ''The Living Goddesses'' University of California Press: 2001</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile women continued to have a higher position in Basque than other western European societies, it is highly unlikely that any point the society was 'matriarchal', as is often falsely claimed about pre-Indo-European peoples in general. The 'Basque matriarchy' argument is typically tied to 20th century nationalism and is at odds with earlier accounts of the society.<ref>Bullen, Margaret. ''Basque Gender Studies'' (p.118-120)</ref>\n\nAlthough the [[kingdom of Navarre]] did adopt feudalism, most Basques also possessed unusual social institutions different from those of the rest of feudal Europe. Some aspects of this include the [[elizate]] tradition where local house-owners met in front of the church to elect a representative to send to the ''juntas'' and ''[[Juntas Generales]]'' (such as the ''Juntas Generales de Vizcaya'' or ''Guip\u00fazcoa'') which administered much larger areas. Another example was the fact that in the medieval period most land was owned by the farmers, not the Church or a king.<ref name=\"Trask1997\"/>{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}<ref name=\"oprmay\">Collins, R. ''The Basques'' Blackwell: 1986</ref>\n\n==Sports in the Basque Country==\n[[File:LuxioApustua.jpg|thumb|Rivalry and betting in a [[Aizkolaritza|wood-chopping contest (1949)]]]]\n\n===Pelota===\n{{Main|Basque pelota}}\nThe great family of ball games has its unique offspring among Basque ball games, known generically as [[Basque pelota|pilota]] (Spanish: ''pelota''). Some variants have been exported to the United States and [[Macau]] under the name of [[Jai Alai]].\n\n===Rural sports===\n[[File:Remo-ria-de-bilbao.jpg|thumb|''Trainerilla'' in the [[Estuary of Bilbao|Bilbao estuary]]]]\n[[File:20060122 barrenak gora.jpg|thumb|''Barrenatzaileak'' in [[Barakaldo]].]]\n\n{{Main|Basque rural sports}}\nThere are several sports derived by Basques from everyday chores. Heavy workers were challenged and bets placed upon them. Examples are:\n* ''[[estropadak]]'' rowing regattas: from fishermen activities.\n* ''[[Basque rural sports#Sokatira (tug-of-war)|sokatira]]'': tug-of-war.\n* ''[[Harri-jasotzaileak|harri-jasotzea]]'': stone-lifting, from quarry works.\n* ''[[aizkolaritza]]'' and ''[[Basque rural sports#Trontza (sawing)|trontzalaritza]]'': wood-chopping and log sawing.\n* ''[[Basque rural sports#Sega jokoa (scything)|sega jokoa]]'': cutting grass with a [[scythe]].\n* ''[[Basque rural sports#Giza-abere probak (dragging games)|Giza-abere probak]]'': stone block pulling, from construction works:\n** ''[[idi probak]]'' with teams of oxen.\n** ''asto probak'' with donkeys.\n** ''zaldi probak'' with horses.\n** ''gizon probak'' with human teams.\n* ''[[Basque rural sports#Txinga eramatea (weight carrying)|txinga eramatea]]'': carrying of weights, one in each hand, representing milk canisters.\n* ''[[Basque rural sports#Ahari topeka (ram fighting)|ahari topaketa]]: ram fights.\n* ''[[Basque rural sports#Harri zulaketa (hole drilling)|harri zulaketa]]'' competitions: drilling stone blocks with a metal bar, only in the former mining areas of West Biscay.\n* [[Basque rural sports#Txakur probak (sheepdog trials)|Basque sheepdog trials]] competitions.\n\n===Bull runs and bullock games===\nThe [[encierro]] (bull run) in [[Pamplona]]'s [[festival|fiestas]] ''[[San Ferm\u00edn|Sanfermines]]'' started as a transport of bulls to the ring. These encierros, as well as other bull and [[Cattle|bullock]] related activities are not exclusive to Pamplona but are traditional in many towns and villages of the Basque country.\n\n===Football===\n{{Main|Basque Country national football team}}\nThere are several clubs within the Basque Country, such as [[Athletic Bilbao]], [[Real Sociedad]], [[Deportivo Alav\u00e9s]], [[SD Eibar]] and, as Navarre club, the [[CA Osasuna]] (the only club in [[La Liga]] that has a Basque name \u2014 ''osasuna'' means \"health\"). In the 2016\u20132017 season these five clubs played together in La Liga, the first instance where five Basque clubs have reached that level at the same time. Athletic's [[Athletic Bilbao signing policy|recruitment policy]] has meant the club refuses to sign any non-Basque players.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.athletic-club.eus/en/club.html | title = Athletic Club Official Site - Club overview including 'code'}}</ref> Real Sociedad also previously employed such a policy.\n\n===Rugby union===\n[[Rugby union]] is a popular sport among French Basques, with major clubs [[Biarritz Olympique]] and [[Aviron Bayonnais]] traditional powerhouses in the premier division of French Rugby (the [[Top 14]]). Biarritz regularly play [[Heineken Cup]] matches, especially knockout matches, at [[Estadio Anoeta]] in [[San Sebasti\u00e1n|San Sebastian]]. Games between the Basque clubs and Catalan club [[USA Perpignan]] are always hard fought.\n\n===Professional cycling===\nCycling is popular and the [[Euskaltel-Euskadi]] professional cycling team, partly sponsored by the Basque Government participated in the UCI World Tour division until 2014. Known for their orange tops and hill-climbing ability, their fans were famous for lining the famous Pyrenean climbs in the Tour de France, in support of their compatriots.\n\nEach April the week-long [[Tour of the Basque Country]] showcases the beautiful rolling Basque countryside. [[Miguel Indurain]], born in [[Villava]] is one of the most celebrated cyclists in the world having won 5 consecutive [[Tour de France|Tours de France]].\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Basque Country (greater region)#Politics}}\n[[File:Giza katea, Urbia.JPG|thumb|[[2014 human chain for Basque Country's right to decide]]]]\n[[File:Gure Esku Dago manifestazioa \"Demokrazia\" - Bilbo 2017-19-16 - 9.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in [[Bilbao]] in solidarity with [[2017 Catalan independence referendum|Catalan independence referendum]], September 2017]]\nWhile there is no independent Basque state, Spain's [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]] of the Basque Country, made up of the provinces of \u00c1lava (Araba), Biscay (Bizkaia) and Gipuzkoa, is primarily a historical consequence and an answer to the wide autonomy claim of its population.\n\nNavarre has a separate statute of autonomy, a contentious arrangement designed during Spanish transition to democracy (the ''Amejoramiento'', an 'upgrade' of its previous status during dictatorship). It refers back to the kingdom status of Navarre (up to 1841) and their traditional institutional and legal framework ([[Fuero#Basque and Pyrenean fueros|charters]]). Basque, the original and main language of Navarre up to the late 18th century, has kept family transmission especially in the northern part of Navarre and central areas to a lesser extent, designated as Basque speaking or mixed area in Navarrese law. Questions of political, linguistic and cultural allegiance and identity are highly complex in Navarre. Politically some Basque nationalists would like to integrate with the Basque Autonomous Community.\n\nThe [[French Basque Country]] today does not exist as a formal political entity and is officially simply part of the French [[department (country subdivision)|department]] of [[Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Atlantiques]], centered in [[B\u00e9arn]]. In recent years the number of mayors of the region supporting the creation of a separate Basque department has grown to 63.87%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maire-info.com/territoires/departements/64-des-maires-basques-favorables-un-departement-pays-basque-article-6264 |title=64% des maires basques favorables \u00e0 un d\u00e9partement Pays Basque |date=2 Nov 2005 |publisher=Maire-info.com |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> So far, their attempts have been unsuccessful.\n\n==Political conflicts==\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Basque language}}\n{{See also|Basque Country (greater region)#Language}}\n\nBoth the Spanish and French governments have, at times, suppressed Basque [[natural language|linguistic]] and cultural identity. The [[French Republics (disambiguation)|French Republics]], the epitome of the [[nation-state]], have a long history of attempting the complete cultural absorption of cultural minority groups. Spain has, at most points in its history, granted some degree of linguistic, cultural, and even political autonomy to its Basques, but under the [[Spain under Franco|regime of Francisco Franco]], the Spanish government reversed the advances of Basque nationalism, as it had fought in the opposite side of the [[Spanish Civil War]]: cultural activity in Basque was limited to folkloric issues and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\nToday, the [[Southern Basque Country]] within Spain enjoys an extensive cultural and political autonomy. The majority of schools under the jurisdiction of the [[Basque education system]] use Basque as the primary medium of teaching. However, the situation is more delicate in the [[French Basque Country|Northern Basque Country]] within France, where Basque is not officially recognized, and where lack of autonomy and monolingual public schooling in French exert great pressure on the Basque language.\n\nIn Navarre, Basque has been declared an endangered language, since the anti-Basque and conservative government of [[Navarrese People's Union]] opposes the symbols of Basque culture,<ref>Resolution of the General Assembly of the European Bureau for Lesser Used Languages, 13 September 2003 (Helsinki), on the situation of the Basque language in the Autonomous Community of Navarre. Reported in MERCATOR Butlleti 55: \"Speakers of a regional or minority language should have the right to use their language in private and public life. Contrary to these principles, local authorities from Iru\u00f1a/Pamplona (capital city of the Autonomous Community of [[Navarre]] in Spain) have been implementing a series of reforms to the Autonomous Community legislation limiting the use of the Basque language.

Within the Basque country, this element of Basque politics is often in balance with the conception of the Basque Country as just another part of the Spanish state, a view more commonly espoused on the right of the political spectrum. In contrast, the desire for greater autonomy or independence is particularly common among [[left-wing politics|leftist]] Basque nationalists. The right of self-determination was asserted by the [[Basque Parliament]] in 2002 and 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eitb24.com/portal/eitb24/noticia/en/politics/pp-and-pse-voted-against-basque-parliament-adopts-resolution-on-s?itemId=B24_18787&cl=%2Feitb24%2Fpolitica&idioma=en |title=EITB: ''Basque parliament adopts resolution on self-determination'' |publisher=Eitb24.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}</ref>\nSince self-determination is not recognized in the [[Spanish Constitution of 1978]], a wide majority of Basques abstained (55%) and some even voted against it (23.5%) in the ratification referendum of December 6 of that year. However, it was approved by clear [[majority]] overall in Spanish (87%). The autonomous regime for the Basque Country was approved in a 1979 referendum but the autonomy of Navarre (''Amejoramiento del Fuero'': \"improvement of the charter\") was never subject to a referendum but only approved by the Navarrese Cortes (parliament).\n\n====Political violence====\n{{Main|Basque conflict}}\n{{See also|ETA (separatist group)|Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci\u00f3n|Batall\u00f3n Vasco Espa\u00f1ol|Comandos Aut\u00f3nomos Anticapitalistas|Iraultza}}\n{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}\n\n==Classification==\nAs with their language, the Basques are clearly a distinct cultural group in their region.

Surrounded by [[Romance languages|Romance-language]] speakers, the Basques traditionally spoke (and many still speak) a language that was not only non-Romance but non-Indo-European. The prevailing belief amongst Basques, and forming part of their national identity, is that their language has continuity with the people who were in this region since not only pre-Roman and pre-Celtic times, but since the Stone Age.\n\n==Genetics==\n[[File:06_laiatzen.jpg|thumb|Basque peasants [[Laia (tool)|ploughing]]]]\nIn 1920, [[H. G. Wells]] referred to the [[Mediterranean race]] as the ''Iberian race''. He regarded it as a fourth subrace of the Caucasian race, along with the ''Aryan'', ''Semitic'', and ''Hamitic'' subraces. He stated that the main [[ethnic group]] that most purely represented the racial stock of the Iberian race was the Basques, and that the Basques were the descendants of the [[Cro-Magnons]].<ref>Wells, H.

Additionally, the Basque population has virtually no [[ABO blood group system|B blood type]], nor the related AB type.

Methcathinone has long been used as a drug of abuse in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Russia]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}\n\nCirca 1994, the United States government recommended to the [[UN Secretary-General]] that methcathinone should be listed as a [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Schedule I|Schedule I controlled substance]] in the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]].<ref>[http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/chemicals_law1.shtml Erowid]</ref>\n\nIn parts of [[Europe]] methcathinone is not listed as a dangerous drug.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}  In the [[United Kingdom]] it is listed as a [[class B drugs|Class B]] drug, but the [[Home Office]] is considering reclassifying it as Class A when it is dissolved in water for injection, as amphetamine is.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Chemistry==\n{{More citations needed section|date=September 2014}}\nMethcathinone is a beta-keto N-methylamphetamine and is closely related to the naturally occurring compounds, [[cathinone]] and [[cathine]]. It is also very closely related to [[methamphetamine]], differing by only the \u03b2-[[ketone]] substituent and differing from [[amphetamine]] by both a keto and N-methyl substituent. Its carbon skeleton is identical to pseudoephedrine and methamphetamine. It differs from pseudoephedrine in that the hydroxide beta to the aromatic ring is oxidized to a ketone.\n\nMethcathinone possesses a [[chiral carbon]] atom, and therefore ''two'' enantiomers are possible. When it is made semi-synthetically  from pseudo/ephedrine as a starting material, then only a single enantiomer is produced. Given that the chiral center has an [[Alpha and beta carbon#Enols and enolates|alpha hydrogen]] and adjacent the carbonyl group, the molecule will [[racemization|racemize]] in solution via an [[enol]] intermediate. This process is known as [[keto\u2013enol tautomerism]].\n\nMethcathinone production utilizes the [[oxidation]] of [[pseudoephedrine]] or [[ephedrine]], the former being preferred because of much higher yields achieved. Oxidation of [[pseudoephedrine]] to methcathinone requires little [[chemistry]] experience, making it (relatively) easy to synthesize.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/35411/The-Clandestine-Chemists-Notebook The Clandestine Chemists Notebook]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}} [[Potassium permanganate]] (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) is most commonly used as the oxidant.\n\nIn clandestine laboratories, synthesizing methcathinone using potassium permanganate is considered undesirable because of the low yields and the high toxicity of this oxidant, however, if done in a proper laboratory using the proper procedures potassium permanganate can be a high-yielding reactant. A method that yields more methcathinone is oxidizing (pseudo)ephedrine with [[Jones oxidation|chromium (VI)]] compounds.\n\nMethcathinone as free base is very unstable; it easily loses its [[ketone]] group, which is substituted with a [[hydroxyl]] group, yielding [[pseudoephedrine]], in the reverse of the typical synthesis reaction.  Structurally, this occurs when the C=O bond at the R\u03b2-position is converted into a C-OH bond. Additionally, a dimerization reaction has been observed in solutions of freebase methcathinone, which yields a biologically inactive compound.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=http://chromsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/12/552.full.pdf+html | doi=10.1093/chromsci/32.12.552| title=Methcathinone and Designer Analogues: Synthesis, Stereochemical Analysis, and Analytical Properties| journal=Journal of Chromatographic Science| volume=32| issue=12| pages=552\u2013564| year=1994| last1=Deruiter| first1=J.| last2=Hayes| first2=L.| last3=Valaer| first3=A.| last4=Clark| first4=C.

It is also very closely related to [[methamphetamine]], differing by only the \u03b2-[[ketone]] substituent and differing from [[amphetamine]] by both a keto and N-methyl substituent. Its carbon skeleton is identical to pseudoephedrine and methamphetamine. It differs from pseudoephedrine in that the hydroxide beta to the aromatic ring is oxidized to a ketone.\n\nMethcathinone possesses a [[chiral carbon]] atom, and therefore ''two'' enantiomers are possible. When it is made semi-synthetically  from pseudo/ephedrine as a starting material, then only a single enantiomer is produced. Given that the chiral center has an [[Alpha and beta carbon#Enols and enolates|alpha hydrogen]] and adjacent the carbonyl group, the molecule will [[racemization|racemize]] in solution via an [[enol]] intermediate. This process is known as [[keto\u2013enol tautomerism]].\n\nMethcathinone production utilizes the [[oxidation]] of [[pseudoephedrine]] or [[ephedrine]], the former being preferred because of much higher yields achieved. Oxidation of [[pseudoephedrine]] to methcathinone requires little [[chemistry]] experience, making it (relatively) easy to synthesize.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/35411/The-Clandestine-Chemists-Notebook The Clandestine Chemists Notebook]</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}} [[Potassium permanganate]] (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) is most commonly used as the oxidant.\n\nIn clandestine laboratories, synthesizing methcathinone using potassium permanganate is considered undesirable because of the low yields and the high toxicity of this oxidant, however, if done in a proper laboratory using the proper procedures potassium permanganate can be a high-yielding reactant. A method that yields more methcathinone is oxidizing (pseudo)ephedrine with [[Jones oxidation|chromium (VI)]] compounds.\n\nMethcathinone as free base is very unstable; it easily loses its [[ketone]] group, which is substituted with a [[hydroxyl]] group, yielding [[pseudoephedrine]], in the reverse of the typical synthesis reaction.  Structurally, this occurs when the C=O bond at the R\u03b2-position is converted into a C-OH bond. Additionally, a dimerization reaction has been observed in solutions of freebase methcathinone, which yields a biologically inactive compound.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=http://chromsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/12/552.full.pdf+html | doi=10.1093/chromsci/32.12.552| title=Methcathinone and Designer Analogues: Synthesis, Stereochemical Analysis, and Analytical Properties| journal=Journal of Chromatographic Science| volume=32| issue=12| pages=552\u2013564| year=1994| last1=Deruiter| first1=J.| last2=Hayes| first2=L.| last3=Valaer| first3=A.| last4=Clark| first4=C.
