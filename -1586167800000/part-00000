{"title_page": "Middle-earth in film", "text_new": "[[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then partially passed them to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]]. During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L.

Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Tolkien received a suggestion in fan-mail to have ''The Hobbit'' adapted to a serial in four intervals, which was declined by [[Rayner Unwin]] for its potential to \"incarcerate us in the local odeons for nine or ten hours.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Rembrandt films ===\nIn 1961, [[William L. Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R.

In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in a projection room at New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nProducer [[Samuel Gelfman]] first inquired about the rights to the books in 1959. The idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions.

United Artists were the studio behind several of the lucrative widescreen epics of the decade. In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in the conversations with Gelfman and in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Around this time, Lean's writer [[Robert Bolt]] turned down writing a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic for the same reason, and in the early 1970s both Bolt and Lean would pull out of an adaptation of [[Dune (novel)#Adaptations|Dune]], which would then be briefly attached to [[Rospo Pallenberg]] and eventually passing to [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].\n\nDenis contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Jim |last=Korkis |authorlink= |date = |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become [[Wizards (film)|''Wizards'']]. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project. UA stayed as the distributors. The first film was budgeted at $8 million.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lord-rings-almost-starred-mick-jagger-1160023|title=How the Battle for 'Lord of the Rings' Nearly Broke a Director|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSince Bakshi was primarily interested in Tolkien's more adult-oriented novel, Zaentz' Fantasy films procured the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'' as well as the rights to produce ''The Hobbit''. The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look. Animation was performed in the US by Bakshi's studio, and Bakshi's request for three additional months to edit the film was turned down, and he had only four weeks left to cut the film, of which little was reportedly left on the cutting room floor. The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum. ''The Lord of the Rings'' was released without any indication that a second part would follow, in spite of Bakshi's objections.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /><ref name=\"Fox News\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |title='70s Version of Lord of the Rings 'Devastated' Director Bakshi |accessdate=2007-01-09 |author=Riley, Patrick |date=July 7, 2000 |publisher=Fox News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205084150/http://www.tolkiengesellschaft.de/v4/alleszutolkien/filme/bakshi/bakshisoutingheute.shtml |archivedate=February 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Rated PG, ''The Lord of the Rings'' was the longest animated film made at the time, and cost $8-12<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/56603|title=THE LORD OF THE RINGS (1978)|last=|first=|date=|website=AFI Catalog|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> million to produce, grossing $30.5 million at the [[box office]].<ref name=\"Beck\">{{cite book |last=Beck |first=Jerry |authorlink= |title=The Animated Movie Guide |year=2005 |publisher=Chicago Review Press |location= |pages=[https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ age 155] |isbn=978-1-55652-591-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/animatedmoviegui0000beck/page/ }}</ref> Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] said that it was one of only two major commercial successes in Bakshi's career, the other being ''Fritz the Cat''.<ref name=\"Maltin\">{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |editor= |others= |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |origyear= |month= |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= |volume= |year=1987|publisher=Plume |location= |language= |isbn=978-0-452-25993-5 |oclc= |doi= |id= |pages= |chapter= |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= }}</ref> However, the sum did not encourage the studio with the prospect of a sequel,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and merchandise and VHS sales weren't promising.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref>\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter. October\u2013November 2001.</ref> reading a tie-in version of the book (following it up with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'') and listening to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation. He read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. It was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, the Weinsteins suggested reducing the project to a single, two-hour  film. Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success. With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history,<ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111113606/http://usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html|date=2011-11-11}}, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28 (with the release of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', the series currently has 36 nominations total).

Tolkien]]'s novels ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', set in [[Middle-earth]], have been the subject of various film adaptations. There were many early failed attempts to bring the fictional universe to life in screen, some even rejected by the author himself, who was skeptical of the prospects of an adaptation. While animated and [[Sagan om ringen (1971 film)|live-action shorts]] were made off of Tolkien in 1967 and 1971, the first commercial depiction of the book onscreen was in an  [[The Hobbit (1977 film)|animated TV special in 1977]]. In 1978 the first big screen adaptation of the fictional setting was introduced in the animated ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.  \n\nThe rights to adapt Tolkien's works passed through the hands of several studios, having been briefly leased to [[Rembrandt Films|Rembrandt films]] before being sold perpetually to [[United Artists]], who then partially passed them to [[Fantasy Films|Fantasy films]]. During this time, filmmakers who attempted to adapt Tolkien's works include [[William L. Snyder|William Snyder]], [[Peter Shaffer]], [[John Boorman]], [[Ralph Bakshi]], [[Peter Jackson]] and [[Guillermo del Toro|Guillermo Del Toro]]. Other filmmakers and producers who were interested in an adaptation included [[Walt Disney]], [[Forrest J Ackerman|Forrest Ackerman]], [[Denis O'Bell|Denis O'Dell]] (who contacted [[David Lean]], [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]] to direct) and [[Heinz Edelmann]]. \n\n[[New Line Cinema]] released the first part of director [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film series]] in 2001 as part of a trilogy and several actors and roles were introduced once again in a trilogy in [[The Hobbit (film series)|''The Hobbit'' film series]]. In 2017, Amazon co-operated with New Line to acquire the TV rights to adapt a new prequel show set in a period glimpsed during a flashback in ''The Lord of the Rings'' films. \n\nCollectively, the New Line franchise has received a record 37 [[Academy Award]] nominations, winning 17, and three special awards, also a record. Along with [[The Godfather trilogy|''The Godfather'' trilogy]], it is one of two film series to date to have received three [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture nominations]]. The third film in Peter Jackson's trilogy, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'', was the first and, as of 2020, only high-fantasy film to win Best Picture, as well as the second sequel to do so after ''[[The Godfather Part II]]''. Along with ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' and ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'', ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds the record for Academy Awards won by a single film (not bringing into account two Technical Achievement Awards given to its crew) and is the only one of the three films to win every category for which it was nominated.\n\nThere have also been a biopic of Tolkien's, as well as [[fan film]]s of Middle-earth such as ''[[The Hunt for Gollum]]'' and ''[[Born of Hope]]'', which were uploaded to YouTube on May 8, 2009 and December 11, 2009 respectively.\n\n==Early attempts==\nTolkien watched films,<ref name=\":13\" /> but always had a mistrust of the medium<ref name=\":14\" /> and of his books' suitability for dramatization.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/04/19/jrr-tolkien-film-my-books-its-easier-to-film-the-odyssey/|title=JRR Tolkien: 'Film my books?

An animator of [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney's]] sent a memo suggesting that elements of ''The Hobbit'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle could be incorporated into the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winning animated anthology film, ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=99-108}}</ref> According to animator [[Wolfgang Reitherman]], Walt Disney wanted to make a ''Lord of the Rings'' feature in the 1950s, but his storyboard artists deemed it too complex, lengthy and scary for a Disney feature.<ref name=\":0\" /> These attempts were the basis of the rumour (perpetuated later by [[Ralph Bakshi]]) that Disney held the rights to Tolkien's works before [[United Artists]], which is untrue. On these rumours it was later said in the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] that Disney deemed that Tolkien's writings \"lacked the kind of humor that audiences expect from Disney animation\u201d and that \u201cany attempt to alter story to inject such humor might result in bad will and vocal resentment among Tolkien devotees.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1972, Disney storyman [[Vance Gerry]] pitched an animated adaptation dedicated to ''The Hobbit''. He illustrated [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]], and produced a synopsis of the work, prefacing that the Disney company had \u201cnever done a cartoon with this much story\u201d, admitting that \u201cthere are far more incidents in the story than we could ever use\u201d and that \u201cmany sections are too frightening for our purposes.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://66.media.tumblr.com/cc128fe690496073b8ff9852fcdbfad0/tumblr_os2m0nY2O61vi7r4lo4_1280.jpg|title=The Hobbit, 11/10/1972|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> He suggested cutting the scarier sequences, which would possibly include the spiders. The pitch was never green-lit, and the project died until 1996.\n\n=== Forrest J. Ackerman ===\nIn June 1956, animator [[Al Brodax]] reached out to Tolkien's publisher's with a proposal for an animated film adaptation of his works, appearantly of ''The Lord of the Rings''. Tolkien was cautiously interested, saying he should \"welcome the idea\" of a film, \"quite apart from the glint of money\",<ref name=\":2\" /> but nothing came out of it.\n\nAt the end of the year, Tolkien was approached by American agent [[Forrest J. Ackerman]], who had an interest in producing an animated film based on Tolkien's work for am amateur screenwriter and acquaintance called Morton Grady Zimmerman. Ackerman, a literary agent and genre fan, wanted to get into producing films with this project. \n\nAckerman showed Tolkien artwork by [[Ron Cobb]] and pitched Zimmerman's story synopsis, according to which the story would be condensed to a three-hour animated film, combined with miniature photography and live-action shot around [[California]], and would be presented with two intermissions.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\">{{ME-ref|letters|#261}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=David|title=Tales From Development Hell (New Updated Edition): The Greatest Movies Never Made?|publisher=Titan|year=2012|isbn=9780857687319|location=|pages=8}}</ref> Tolkien already had objections at this phase \u2013 [[Lothl\u00f3rien|Lothlorien]] was described to him as a fairy-castle, and the story had been greatly condensed<ref name=\":3\" /> \u2013 but he liked the concept art, which he describes as akin to [[Arthur Rackham]]<ref>{{ME-ref|letters|#17}}</ref> as opposed to Walt Disney, whom he loathed. He delayed in reviewing the synopsis until urged by Unwin, and once he delivered his initial notes to Ackerman, the agent was granted a six-month option on the book, if he could find a producer to finance the project.

He complained of divergence from not only the tone of the book (such as a \"fairy-tale\" depiction of [[Lothl\u00f3rien]], as well as elements cut \"upon which [the book's] characteristic and peculiar tone principally depends\") but also the character representation (such as Sam leaving Frodo to [[Shelob]] and going on to [[Mount Doom]] alone). In addition, he took issue with dialogue changes as regards to the \"style and sentiment\" of characters, and with intercutting between the storylines of Frodo and Aragorn. He suggested eliminating the battle of [[Helm's Deep]] to better emphasize the defense of [[Minas Tirith]], as well as cutting characters out instead of diminishing their roles. Tolkien protested against added \"incantations, blue lights, and some irrelevant magic\" and \"a preference for fights\".<ref name=\"Screenplays\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|title=Three Rings for Hollywood: Scripts for The Lord of the Rings by Zimmerman, Boorman, and Beagle|author=Croft, Janet B.|date=2004-04-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903220627/http://faculty-staff.ou.edu/C/Janet.B.Croft-1/three_rings_for_hollywood.htm|archivedate=2006-09-03|accessdate=2006-11-29}}</ref>\n\nNevertheless, Tolkien didn't wish to kill the project \"which I think promised well on the pictorial side.\"<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite book|last=Hammond|first=Wayne G.|title=The J.R.R.

Snyder]] negotiated the rights to adapt ''The Hobbit'' to animation. His company, Rembrandt films, had won multiple Oscars for animated shorts, and he contacted Tolkien's agent for the rights to ''The Hobbit.'' Unlike Ackerman, Snyder could raise sufficient funds for Tolkien and Unwin to enter negotiations to lease ''The Hobbit'' to him for five years, and give him creative freedom in adapting the book in exchange for a precentage off of the revenue. Due to a mishap in the publishing of the first edition of ''The Hobbit'' (and, later on, ''The Lord of the Rings'') the books were public domain in the US, which gave Snyder leverage to renegotiate the conditions of the lease. Tolkien and Unwin only received a $15,000 advance.<ref name=\":16\">{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Stuart D.|title=A Companion to J. R. R.

In 1964 Tolkien was still wondering if a film will be made, and what it will be like, and Snyder reported that a script was being finalized.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSnyder commissioned cartoonist [[Gene Deitch]] to write a script for a feature-length ''Hobbit'' cartoon, during which he took significant liberties with the text, inserting a princess of Dale who undertakes the Quest and ends up married to Bilbo. Since ''The Lord of the Rings'' wasn't published in the US at the time, Deitch only became aware of it later on,<ref name=\":0\" /> and incorporated the concept of the Ring of Power into the Gollum (or Goloom, as he's called in the piece) episode later in the writing, making a sequel based on ''The Lord of the Rings'' possible.\n\nWhen a deal with [[20th Century Studios|20th Century Fox]] fell through and the rights we due to expire, Snyder commissioned Deitch to quickly make a condensed film that would fulfill the requirements of the contract. The deal was for an animated, colour film but didn't specify length, and so Deitch had to compress the story into [[The Hobbit (1966 film)|an animated short]], which was screened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1967. This prolonged Snyder's lease on the rights, which Snyder was now aware were highly prized.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch's film technically constitues the first onscreen depiction of any of Tolkien's works, but it amounts to little more than a narrated picture-book, with a narrator telling the short story (twelve minutes in length) over a series of animation stills. The film was only exhibited once in New York to around twelve spectactors who were pulled from the street, provided the admission money by the exhibitors so that they may sign a document stating that they payed to see a colour film based on ''The Hobbit''.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDeitch recalled that the extended lease extended to the rights to ''The Lord of the Rings'', and that the rights to both novels were sold back Tolkien for a higher price.<ref name=\"Deitch\">{{cite web|url=http://genedeitchcredits.com/roll-the-credits-01/40-william-l-snyder/|title=William L.

Carole Ward suggested adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' for TV in 1964, to air on the newly-launched [[BBC Two|BBC2]]. [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] launched a competing offer, according to which the book will be adapted via puppetry, which Tolkien found contemptous. Another attempt at purchasing the TV rights was made in 1968, which would put it concurrently with the cinema rights being sold to United Artists. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Robb|first=Brian J.|title=Middle-earth Envisioned: The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings: On Screen, On Stage, and Beyond.|last2=Simpson|first2=Paul|publisher=Race Point Publishing.|year=2013|isbn=9781937994273|location=|pages=65-67}}</ref>\n\n=== United Artists ===\nProducer [[Samuel Gelfman]] first inquired about the rights to the books in 1959. The idea of live-action fantasy became fashionable in the early 1960s due to the success of [[Ray Harryhausen]]'s Stop-motion productions.

United Artists were the studio behind several of the lucrative widescreen epics of the decade. In the 1960s, long widescreen epics (presented as a [[Roadshow theatrical release|roadshow]] with an intermission) still proved successful, but few sequels were made in that genre, and therefore Katzka-Bernie commissioned Sir [[Peter Shaffer]] to write a treatment for a single, three-hour film adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'', which was deemed \"elegant\",<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/25681-ralph-bakshi-the-lord-of-the-rings-animation-review-anniversary|title=The Lord of the Rings Animation Review Anniversary|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> keeping ''The Hobbit'' in mind as a potential prequel. Merchandizing was of little concern at the time, but the rights to make profit off of such productions was included in the contract.\n\nNegotiations extended until 1969, when the rights were sold off for $250,000 (adjusted for inflation, the modern equivalent is about $1.5 million) and 7.5% of gross receipts, minus expenses, to be paid to Tolkien. Shaffer's script never got off of the ground, but the rights were sold to United Artists in perpetuity, including the option to pass the rights to another studio. [[Arlo Guthrie]] pitched an animated feature to the studio, but UA were adamant they wanted the film to be live-action, although the contract options an animated film.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStanley Unwin suggested that Tolkien's inexperience in dealing with movie producers led to the generous conditions of the contract.<ref name=\":16\" /> Now elderly, Tolkien's desire to set-up a trust fund for his grandchildren could indicate that he might not have expected to live and see the resulting film, and wanted to use the profits to take care of his ailing wife.<ref name=\":0\" /> The increase in income tax rates at the time decreased Tolkien's profits off of book sales, and he expected a fall-off in the sales in years to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/focus-tolkien-sold-film-rights-to-lord-of-the-rings-to-avoid-taxman-ttwv6qh3rlv|title=Focus: Tolkien sold film rights to Lord of the Rings to avoid taxman|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 1968, Tolkien expressed skepticism about adapting his works to film, saying \"its easier to film the Odyssey\"<ref name=\":15\" />, although he reportedly exhibited cautious enthusiasm in the conversations with Gelfman and in a later correspondence with John Boorman. \n\n==== Apple films ====\nDuring this period, [[The Beatles]] were on a three-picture deal with United Artists. Their previous two features, ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', were directed by [[Richard Lester]] and were financially successful. When it became clear that the animated [[Yellow Submarine (film)|Yellow Submarine]] would not count as part of this deal, Denis O'Dell (head of the Beatles' [[Apple Films]]) entered negotiations for their third film. He came up with the idea of a ''Lord of the Rings'' \"multimedia musical extravaganza\",<ref name=\":11\" /> starring the Beatles as the four Hobbits. He eventually learned that UA themselves were in negotiations for the rights.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|last=O'Dell|first=Dennis|title=At the Apple's core: the Beatles from the inside|publisher=Peter Owen Limited|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=92-105}}</ref>\n\nIn conversation with studio heads [[David V. Picker|David]] and Arnold Picker, it was decided that [[Richard Lester]] wasn't up for such an undertaking and a \"star director\" was required. O'Dell shortlisted Sir [[David Lean]] (with his writer at-the-time, [[Robert Bolt]]), [[Stanley Kubrick]] and [[Michelangelo Antonioni|Michaelangelo Antonioni]]. Lean and Kubrick, in particular, had experience in adapting literary works into widescreen epics, while Antonioni recently made his breakout English-language film in ''[[Blowup]]''.\n\nO'Dell phoned Lean once he got back to the hotel. Lean was a fan of ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and his brother [[Edward Tangye Lean|Tangye]] was an acquaintance of Tolkien's. He was interested, but busy with ''[[Ryan's Daughter]]''. \"Its a very interesting idea, Denis. Unfortunately I'm tied up at the moment with a little love story I'm going to do out here.\u201d<ref name=\":4\" /> Around this time, Lean's writer [[Robert Bolt]] turned down writing a [[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]] biopic for the same reason, and in the early 1970s both Bolt and Lean would pull out of an adaptation of [[Dune (novel)#Adaptations|Dune]], which would then be briefly attached to [[Rospo Pallenberg]] and eventually passing to [[Denis Villeneuve|Denis Villenueve]].\n\nDenis contacted Kubrick, who hadn't read the books, but was sent copies to read during the voyage back the UK. Meanwhile, O'Dell left to [[India]] to visit the Beatles, with the books in his suitcase. At the behest of [[Donovan]], who had previously been musically and cinematically interested in the books, the band divided the three volumes among themselves (Harrison was absent on the day of O'Dell's arrival) and began to think \"seriously\" about the idea.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nAccording to O'Dell, [[John Lennon|Lennon]] (reportedly the most taken with the books) fancied the role of Gandalf, but [[George Harrison|Harrison]] later recalled that John eventually wanted to swap for Frodo. Ringo wanted to play Sam, and [[Paul McCartney|McCartney]], also taken with the book, coveted Frodo. He later told Jackson that Lennon would have been Gollum, [[Ringo Starr|Ringo]] Sam and Harrison Gandalf.

In 1957, he started trying to obtain the rights by convincing producers that the books could be animated,<ref name=\"Jim Hill Media\">{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_korkis/archive/2003/06/24/1087.aspx |title=If at first you don't succeed ... call Peter Jackson |accessdate=2007-01-02 |first=Jim |last=Korkis |authorlink= |date = |format= |work= |publisher=Jim Hill Media |pages= |language= |quote= }}</ref> and developing his own Tolkien-esque fantasy film \"in the American idiom\" which would become [[Wizards (film)|''Wizards'']]. When he learned of Tolkien's death in 1973, Bakshi approached Medavoy and proposed that United Artists produce ''The Lord of the Rings'' as two or three animated films,<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> and a ''Hobbit'' prequel.<ref name=\":20\" /> Medavoy offered him Boorman's script, which Bakshi refused, saying that Boorman \"didn't understand it\", and would later call the Rankin and Bass TV special an \"awful, sell-out version of ''The Hobbit''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nashvillepubliclibrary.org/offtheshelf/legends-of-film-ralph-bakshi/|title=Legends of Film: Ralph Bakshi|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBakshi and [[Dan Melnick]], then-president of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], made a deal with United Artists to purchase the film rights to the story for $3 million (covering the cost of Boorman's screenwriting), and Bakshi started pre-production. Bakshi started writing, enlisting Chris Conkling to do research for the script, eventually to promote him to screenwriter. With Conkling, they considered ways to divide the story. When they started, they contemplated a three-film structure, but \u201cwe didn't know how that middle film would work\u201d<ref name=\":7\" /> without a beginning and an end. Conkling even started writing one long, three-and-a-half hour feature of the entire work. Early drafts of Conkling's included Farmer Maggot, Tom Bombadil, the Old Forest, Glorfindel, Arwen, and several songs. \n\nHowever, with $200,000 spent, Dan Melnick was fired from MGM.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Bakshi contacted [[Saul Zaentz]], who had helped finance ''Fritz the Cat'', and persuaded him to produce ''[[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.<ref name=\"Robinson\" /> Zaentz had recently produced the Academy Award winning adaptation of ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]],'' distributed by United Artists, and agreed to buy the project.

The rights to distribute the prequel remained with United Artists.\n\nAfter several drafts, Conkling's work was deemed unsatisfactory by Bakshi and Zaentz, who brought Peter S. Beagle to do rewrites. He insisted a complete overhaul was necessary, and wrote a version which began at Bilbo's Farewell Party, and continued until Saruman's Death, while Frodo and Sam left Cirith Ungol. This was abbreviated and cut in later revisions (adding a brief prologue in the process) so as to allow for a two-and-a-half hour movie.<ref name=\":7\" /> The final revisions overlapped with the voice recording in London, and account for some incosistencies like the spelling of Saruman's name in the film. Bakshi was approached by [[Mick Jagger]]<ref name=\":8\" /> and [[David Carradine]]<ref name=\":19\" /> for roles in the film, and Carradine even suggested that Bakshi do it in live-action.\n\nBakshi went to England to recruit a voice cast from the BBC Drama Repertory Company, including [[Christopher Guard]], [[William Squire]], Michael Scholes, [[Anthony Daniels]] and Sir [[John Hurt]]. Bakshi then shot character actors playing to the recording in empty soundstages, and later rotoscoped the performances.<ref name=\":8\" /> Bakshi later regretted his use of the rotoscoping technique, stating that he made a mistake by tracing the source footage rather than using it as a guide.<ref name=\"DirectorsSeries-1\">{{cite video|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-9111970495147326968|title=The Directors Series: Interview with Ralph Bakshi (Part One)|date=|people=Gallagher, John A.|publisher=Google Video|location=|time=|accessdate=|format=|quote=|medium=}}</ref> Live-action footage for crowd scenes was shot in Death Valley and in Spain.<ref name=\":8\" /> To cut ballooning costs, cinematographer Timothy Galfas suggested solarizing the crowd scenes, to create a pseudo-animated look.

The whole project lasted less than 18 months.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nAt this time, Arthur Krim resigned from United Artists and was replaced by Andy Albeck, who objected to marketing the film as the first of two parts. After test screenings, it was decided to switch the other of the last two sequences, so that the film wouldn't end on the cliffhanger of Frodo and Sam being led into a trap by Gollum.

The series is due to be expanded with a prequel TV show produced by Amazon in cooperation with Warner Brothers.\n\nPeter Jackson first pitched the idea of adapting ''The Lord of the Rings'' and ''The Hobbit'' to [[Miramax]] in 1995. He'd seen Bakshi's ''Lord of the Rings'' in 1978, enjoyed it and \"wanted to know more\",<ref>\"Peter Jackson interview\". ''Explorations''. Barnes & Noble Science Fiction newsletter. October\u2013November 2001.</ref> reading a tie-in version of the book (following it up with ''The Hobbit'' and ''The Silmarillion'') and listening to the 1981 BBC radio adaptation. He read about previous attempts to adapt the work - by Boorman, Kubrick and Lean - but didn't know what was myth and what wasn't at the time.<ref name=\":14\" /> He also watched and enjoyed (but didn't think very highly of) the fantasy films and space operas of the 1980s. He later read Tolkien's letters and learned that Forrest Ackerman, who appeared in Jackson's ''[[Bad Taste]]'', had tried to make a film, as well.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XDsSr3sGSI|title=Sir Peter Jackson in conversation: Exeter College Oxford Eighth Century Lecture Series|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was aware that \"three films would obviously be the more natural way to do\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sibley|first=Brian|title=Peter Jackson: A Film-Maker's Journey|publisher=HarperCollins Entertainment|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=36}}</ref> ''The Lord of the Rings'' and that ''The Hobbit'' is better split across two films, he made a more modest offer of a trilogy: one film based on ''The Hobbit'' which, if proven successful, would be followed by two ''Lord of the Rings'' installments, released six months apart. Although Jackson and Walsh re-read ''The Hobbit'' and even commissioned their workshop at WETA for some concept art, the rights to ''The Hobbit'' proved difficult because they were split between Zaentz and United Artists. [[Harvey Weinstein]] tried to purchase them from the studio, but was unsuccessful. It was decided to move ahead with two ''Lord of the Rings'' films, leaving ''The Hobbit'' as a possible prequel. Jackson also later made joking remarks about TV spinoff shows.<ref>The Two Towers: Director's Commentary</ref>\n===''The Lord of the Rings''===\n{{Main article|The Lord of the Rings (film series)}}\nEventually, with Miramax owner [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] becoming increasingly uneasy with the sheer scope of the proposed project, the Weinsteins suggested reducing the project to a single, two-hour  film. Jackson was willing to consider this, if the film was to be around four hours in length, but Miramax limited it to two hours, and offered suggestions in order to achieve this, namely amalgamating Gondor and Rohan. They contacted [[Hossein Amini]] to rewrite and threatened to get [[John Madden (director)|John Madden]] or [[Quentin Tarantino]] to direct.\n\nJackson refused, and was given the opportunity to find another studio to take over. In 1999, New Line Cinema assumed production responsibility (while Miramax executives [[Bob Weinstein]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] retained on-screen credits as executive producers). The three films were shot simultaneously. They featured extensive [[computer-generated imagery]], including major battle scenes utilizing the \"[[Massive (software)|Massive]]\" software program. The first film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring|The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' was released on December 19, 2001, the second film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers|The Two Towers]]'' on December 18, 2002 and the third film subtitled, ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King|The Return of the King]]'' worldwide on December 17, 2003. All three won the [[Hugo Award]] for Best (Long-form) Dramatic Presentation in their respective years.\n\nThe films were met with both critical and commercial success. With a total of 30 nominations, the trilogy also became the most-nominated in the Academy's history,<ref>[http://www.usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html The film trilogy's entry at UsefulTrivia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111113606/http://usefultrivia.com/movie_trivia/the_lord_of_the_rings_trivia_010a.html|date=2011-11-11}}, last retrieved on 5 August 2006</ref> surpassing the ''[[The Godfather|Godfather]]'' series' 28 (with the release of ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'', the series currently has 36 nominations total).

GISTs arise in the [[smooth muscle]] pacemaker [[interstitial cell of Cajal]], or similar cells.<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" /> They are defined as tumors whose behavior is driven by mutations in the [[KIT (gene)|KIT]] gene (85%),<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" />  [[PDGFRA]] gene (10%),<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" /> or BRAF kinase (rare).<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" /> 95% of GISTs  [[immunohistochemistry|stain]] positively for KIT (CD117).<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" /><ref name=\"Miettinen2006\"/>  Most (66%) occur in the stomach and gastric GISTs have a lower malignant potential than tumors found elsewhere in the GI tract.<ref name=\"Miettinen2006\"/>\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Classification==\nGIST was introduced as a diagnostic term in 1983.<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" />{{rp|1060}} Until the late 1990s, many non-[[epithelium|epithelial]] [[tumor]]s of the [[Human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]] were called \"gastrointestinal stromal tumors\". [[Histopathology|Histopathologists]] were unable to specifically distinguish between types we now know to be dissimilar molecularly. Subsequently, [[Cluster of differentiation|CD34]], and later CD117 were identified as markers that could distinguish the various types.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Additionally, in the absence of specific therapy, the diagnostic categorization had only a limited influence on prognosis and therapy.\n\nThe understanding of GIST biology changed significantly with identification of the [[Molecular genetics|molecular basis]] of GIST,<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" />{{rp|1065}} particularly c-KIT. Historically, literature reviews prior to the molecular definition of GIST, and for a short time thereafter, asserted that 70-80% of GISTs were benign.<ref name=\"Burkill2003\" /><ref name=\"Nishida2000\" /><ref name=\"Miettinen2001\" /> The identification of a molecular basis for GIST led to the exclusion of many tumors that had been considered as GIST previously, and also the incorporation of a much larger number of tumors that had been labeled as other types of sarcomas and undifferentiated carcinomas.<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" />{{rp|1065}}  For example, some previous diagnoses of stomach and small bowel [[leiomyosarcoma]]s (malignant tumor of [[smooth muscle]]) would be reclassified as GISTs on the basis of immunohistochemical staining. All GIST tumors are now considered to have malignant potential, and no GIST tumor can be definitively classified as \"benign\".<ref name=\"Raut2008\" /> Hence, all GISTs are eligible for cancer staging in the AJCC (7th edition) / UICC.<ref>AJCC manual<!--will expand ref properly--></ref> Nonetheless, different GISTs have different risk assessments of their tendency to recur or to metastasize, dependent on their site of origin, size, and number of mitotic figures.<!--expand/merge from e/w in artic-->\n\nDue to the change in definition, clinical pathways of care before the year 2000 are largely uninformative in the current era.<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" />\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n<!--likely most are clinically 'silent'--><!--until v large-->GISTs may present with [[dysphagia|trouble swallowing]], [[gastrointestinal hemorrhage|gastrointestinal bleeding]], or [[metastasis|metastases]] (mainly in the liver). Intestinal obstruction is rare, due to the tumor's outward pattern of growth. Often, there is a history of vague [[abdominal pain]] or discomfort, and the tumor has become rather large by time the diagnosis is made.\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\nGISTs are tumors of [[connective tissue]], i.e. [[sarcoma]]s; unlike [[bowel cancer|most gastrointestinal tumor]]s, they are non[[epithelium|epithelial]]. About 70% occur in the [[stomach]], 20% in the [[small intestine]] and less than 10% in the [[esophagus]]. Small tumors are generally benign, especially when [[mitosis|cell division]] rate is slow, but large tumors disseminate to the [[liver]], [[Greater omentum|omentum]] and [[peritoneal cavity]]. They rarely occur in other abdominal organs.\n\nGISTs are thought to arise from [[interstitial cells of Cajal]] (ICC), that are normally part of the [[autonomic nervous system]] of the intestine.<ref name=\"Miettinen2006\" /> They serve a pacemaker function in controlling [[motility]].\n\n===Genetics===\nMost GISTs are sporadic. Less than 5% occur as part of [[genetic disorder|hereditary]] familial or idiopathic multitumor syndromes. These include, in descending order of frequency, [[neurofibromatosis]] Recklinghausen (NF-1), [[Carney's triad]] (gastric GIST, [[pulmonary]] [[chondroma]] and extra-[[adrenal]] [[paraganglioma]]), [[germline]] [[Gain-of-function mutation|gain-of-function]] [[mutation]]s in [[c-Kit]]/[[PDGFRA]], and the [[Carney's triad#Carney-Stratakis syndrome|Carney-Stratakis syndrome]].<ref name=\"Agaimy2010\" /> The Carney-Stratakis syndrome is a [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]] of hereditary GIST and paraganglioma, that is caused by germline mutations in the [[mitochondria]]l [[tumor suppressor gene]] pathway involving the [[succinate dehydrogenase]] (SDH) subunits [[SDHD]], [[Succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit C|SDHC]] and [[SDHB]].<ref name=\"Stratakis2009\" />\n\n=== c-KIT mutations ===\nApproximately 85% GISTs are associated with an abnormal ''[[c-KIT]]'' pathway. ''c-KIT'' is a gene that encodes for a [[transmembrane receptor]] for a growth factor termed [[stem cell factor]] (''scf''). The abnormal ''c-KIT'' pathway most commonly (85%) arises from [[mutation]]<!--usually [[Mutation#By inheritance|somatic]]/acquired, and only rarely inherited in familial forms--> of the gene itself; a smaller subset of c-KIT-associated GISTs are associated with [[constitutive activity]]<!--will tweak the relevant disambig page when time permits--> of the ''KIT'' [[enzymatic pathway]], found by [[immunoblotting]].<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" />{{rp|1062}}  The c-KIT product/CD117 is expressed on ICCs and a large number of other cells, mainly [[bone marrow]] cells, [[mast cell]]s, [[melanocyte]]s and several others. In the gut, however, a mass staining positive for [[CD117]] is likely to be a GIST, arising from ICC cells.\n\nThe c-KIT [[molecule]] comprises a long [[Membrane protein|extracellular domain]], a [[Membrane protein|transmembrane segment]], and an intracellular part. Mutations generally occur in the [[deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]] encoding the intracellular part (exon 11), which acts as a [[tyrosine kinase]] to activate other [[enzyme]]s. Mutations make c-KITfunction independent of activation by ''scf'', leading to a high cell division rate and possibly genomic instability. Additional mutations are likely \"required\" for a cell with a ''c-KIT'' mutation to develop into a GIST, but the ''c-KIT'' mutation is probably the first step of this process.\n\nMutations in the [[exon]]s 11, 9 and rarely 13 and 17 of the ''c-KIT'' gene are known to occur in GIST. The [[tyrosine kinase]] function of ''c-KIT'' is important in the medical therapy for GISTs, as described below. \n*KIT-D816V [[point mutation]]s in ''c-KIT'' exon 17 are responsible for resistance to targeted therapy drugs like [[imatinib mesylate]], a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n*KIT-p.D419del (exon 8) - A subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumors previously regarded as wild-type tumors carries somatic activating mutations in KIT exon 8 (p.D419del).<ref name=\"pmid23599150\">{{Cite journal | pmid = 23599150| year = 2013| last1 = Huss| first1 = S| title = A subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumors previously regarded as wild-type tumors carries somatic activating mutations in KIT exon 8 (p.D419del)| journal = Modern Pathology| volume = 26| issue = 7| pages = 1004\u201312| last2 = K\u00fcnstlinger| first2 = H| last3 = Wardelmann| first3 = E| last4 = Kleine| first4 = M.

Mutations in ''c-kit'' and ''PDGFrA'' are mutually exclusive [https://web.archive.org/web/20060925045501/http://www.liferaftgroup.org/gist_genetics.html][http://www.liferaftgroup.org/LondnPPT/Fletcher/Fletcher_files/frame.htm]{{dead link|date=April 2016}}.\n\n=== Wild-type tumors ===\nLesser numbers<!--add actual # from citation--> of GISTs appear to be associated with neither c-kit nor PDGFR-\u03b1 abnormalities.<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" />{{rp|1062}}<!--needs discussion of BRAF and of SDHA--> About 10-15% of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) carry wild-type sequences in all hot spots of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) (wt-GISTs). These tumors are currently defined by having no mutations in exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 of the KIT gene and exons 12, 14, and 18 of the PDGFRA gene.<ref name=\"pmid23599150\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:GIST 2.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Endoscopy|Endoscopic]] image of GIST in fundus of [[stomach]], seen on retroflexion.]]\n[[File:GIST 3.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Same GIST seen on forward view of the endoscope showing overlying clot.]]\n[[Computed axial tomography|CT scanning]] is often undertaken (see the ''[[#Radiology|radiology]]'' section).\n\nThe definitive diagnosis is made with a [[biopsy]], which can be obtained [[endoscope|endoscopically]], percutaneously with CT or ultrasound guidance or at the time of surgery. A [[biopsy]] sample will be investigated under the [[light microscopy|microscope]] by a [[pathologist]] physician. The pathologist examines the [[histopathology]] to identify the characteristics of GISTs (spindle cells in 70-80%, epitheloid aspect in 20-30%). Smaller tumors can usually be confined to the muscularis propria layer of the intestinal wall.  Large ones grow, mainly outward, from the bowel wall until the point where they outstrip their blood supply and necrose (die) on the inside, forming a cavity that may eventually come to communicate with the bowel lumen.\n\nWhen GIST is suspected&mdash;as opposed to other causes for similar tumors&mdash;the pathologist can use [[immunohistochemistry]] (specific [[antibody|antibodies]] that stain the molecule [[CD117]] [also known as ''c-kit''] &mdash;see below). 95% of all GISTs are CD117-positive (other possible markers include [[CD34]], DOG-1, [[desmin]], and [[vimentin]]). Other cells that show CD117 positivity are [[mast cell]]s.\n\nIf the CD117 stain is negative and suspicion remains that the tumor is a GIST, the newer antibody DOG-1 (Discovered On GIST-1) can be used. Also [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] of Kit and PDGFRA can be used to prove the diagnosis.\n\n===Imaging===\nThe purpose of radiologic imaging is to locate the lesion, evaluate for signs of invasion and detect [[metastasis]]. Features of GIST vary depending on tumor size and organ of origin. The diameter can range from a few millimeters to more than 30&nbsp;cm.  Larger tumors usually cause symptoms in contrast to those found incidentally which tend to be smaller and have better prognosis.<ref name=\"Burkill2003\" /><ref name=\"Hersh2005\" /> Large tumors tend to exhibit [[cancer|malignant]] behavior but small GISTs may also demonstrate clinically aggressive behavior.<ref name=\"Pidhorecky2000\" />\n[[File:CT image of a GIST tumor in the gastric cardia.jpg|thumb|CT image of a GIST in the [[cardia|gastric cardia]].  The lesion appears submucosal, is [[hypervascular]] and protrudes intraluminally.  Upper GI bleeding led to endoscopy, finding an ulcerated mass.]]\n[[File:GIST CT image.jpg|thumb|Non-enhanced CT image of a small GIST in the posterior stomach wall (arrow).  The lesion appears subserosal. Incidental finding.]]\n\n[[projectional radiography|Plain radiographs]] are not very helpful in the evaluation of GISTs. If an abnormality is seen, it will be an indirect sign due to the tumor mass effect on adjacent organs. On [[abdominal x-ray]], stomach GISTs may appear as a [[radiodensity|radiopaque]] mass altering the shape of the gastric air shadow. Intestinal GISTs may displace loops of bowel and larger tumors may obstruct the bowel and films will show an [[bowel obstruction|obstructive pattern]]. If [[cavitation]]s are present, plain radiographs will show collections of air within the tumor.<ref name=\"Shojaku1997\" /> [[Calcification]] is an unusual feature of GIST but if present can be visible on plain films.\n\n[[barium swallow|Barium fluoroscopic]] examinations and [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] are commonly used to evaluate the patient with abdominal complaints. Barium swallow images show abnormalities in 80% of GIST cases.<ref name=\"Pidhorecky2000\" /> However, some GISTs may be located entirely outside the lumen of the bowel and will not be appreciated with a barium swallow. Even in cases when the barium swallow is abnormal, an MRI or CT scan must follow since it is impossible to evaluate abdominal cavities and other abdominal organs with a barium swallow alone. In a CT scan, abnormalities may be seen in 87% of patients and it should be made with both oral and intravenous contrast.<ref name=\"Pidhorecky2000\" />  Among imaging studies, MRI has the best tissue contrast, which aids in the identification of masses within the GI tract (intramural masses). Intravenous contrast material is needed to evaluate lesion vascularity.\n\nPreferred imaging modalities in the evaluation of GISTs are CT and MRI,<ref name=\"NCCN_STS_3_2012\" />{{rp|20\u201321}} and, in selected situations, endoscopic ultrasound. CT advantages include its ability to demonstrate evidence of nearby organ invasion, ascites, and metastases. The ability of MRI to produce images in multiple planes is helpful in determining the bowel as the organ of origin (which is difficult when the tumor is very large), facilitating diagnosis.<!--role of PET-->\n\n==== Small GISTs ====\nSince GISTs arise from the bowel layer called [[Muscular layer|muscularis propria]] (which is deeper to the [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]] and [[submucosa]] from a [[lumen (anatomy)|luminal]] perspective), small GIST imaging usually suggest a submucosal process or a mass within the bowel wall. In [[barium swallow]] studies, these GISTs most commonly present with smooth borders forming right or obtuse angles with the nearby bowel wall, as seen with any other intramural mass. The mucosal surface is usually intact except for areas of ulceration, which are generally present in 50% of GISTs. Ulcerations fill with barium causing a bull's eye or target lesion appearance. In contrast-enhanced [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]], small GISTs are seen as smooth, sharply defined intramural masses with homogeneous attenuation.\n\n==== Large GISTs ====\nAs the tumor grows it may project outside the bowel (exophytic growth) and/or inside the bowel (intraluminal growth), but they most commonly grow exophytically such that the bulk of the tumor projects into the abdominal cavity. If the tumor outstrips its blood supply, it can [[necrosis|necrose]] internally, creating a central fluid-filled cavity with bleeding and [[cavitation]]s that can eventually ulcerate and communicate into the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the bowel. In that case, barium swallow may show an air, air-fluid levels or oral contrast media accumulation within these areas.<ref name=\"Pidhorecky2000\" /><ref name=\"Lehnert1998\" /> Mucosal ulcerations may also be present. In contrast enhanced CT images, large GISTs appear as heterogeneous masses due to areas of living tumor cells surrounding bleeding, necrosis or cysts, which is radiographically seen as a peripheral enhancement pattern with a low attenuation center.<ref name=\"Hersh2005\" /> In [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] studies, the degree of necrosis and bleeding affects the signal intensity pattern. Areas of bleeding within the tumor will vary its signal intensity depending on how long ago the bleeding occurred. The solid portions of the tumor are typically low signal intensity on [[Magnetic resonance imaging#T1-weighted MRI|T1-weighted images]], are high signal intensity on [[T2-weighted MRI|T2-weighted images]] and enhance after administration of [[gadolinium]]. Signal-intensity voids are present if there is gas within areas of necrotic tumor.<ref name=\"Shojaku1997\" /><ref name=\"Levine1996\" /><ref name=\"Tervahartiala1998\" />\n\n==== Features of malignancy ====\n[[cancer|Malignancy]] is characterized by local invasion and metastases, usually to the [[liver]], [[greater omentum|omentum]] and [[peritoneum]]. However, cases of metastases to bone, [[pleural cavity|pleura]], [[lung]]s and [[retroperitoneal space|retroperitoneum]] have been seen. In distinction to gastric [[adenocarcinoma]] or gastric/small bowel [[lymphoma]], malignant [[lymphadenopathy]] (swollen lymph nodes) is uncommon (&lt;10%) and thus imaging usually shows absence of lymph node enlargement.<ref name=\"Hersh2005\" /> If metastases are not present, other radiologic features suggesting malignancy include: size (&gt;5&nbsp;cm), heterogeneous enhancement after contrast administration and ulcerations.<ref name=\"Burkill2003\" /><ref name=\"Hersh2005\" /><ref name=ulusan >{{cite journal |vauthors=Ulusan S, Koc Z, Kayaselcuk F |title=Gastrointestinal stromal tumours: CT findings |journal=Br J Radiol |volume=81 |pages=618\u2013623 |year=2008 |pmid=18628330 |doi=10.1259/bjr/90134736 |issue=968}}</ref> Also, overtly malignant behavior (in distinction to malignant potential of lesser degree) is less commonly seen in gastric tumors, with a ratio of behaviorally benign to overtly malignant of 3-5:1.<ref name=\"Burkill2003\" /><!--check this is the right place for the current amended language herein--> Even if radiographic malignant features are present, these findings may also represent other tumors and definitive diagnosis must be made [[immunochemistry|immunochemically]].\n\n==Management==\n[[File:Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor.jpg|thumb|Image showing Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor after surgical removal]]\nLocalized, resectable adult GISTs, if  [[anatomy|anatomically]] and [[physiology|physiologically]] feasible, surgery is the primary treatment of choice.<ref name=\"NCCN_STS_3_2012\" />{{rp|69}} Surgery can be potentially curative, but watchful waiting may be considered in small tumors in carefully selected situations.<!--per European guidelines--><ref name=\"Casali2010\" /> Post-surgical adjuvant treatment may be recommended.<ref name=\"Bamboat2012\" /> Lymph node metastases are rare, and routine removal of lymph nodes is typically not necessary.<!--needs expln of exceptions, e.g. pediatric type--> Laparoscopic surgery, a minimally invasive abdominal surgery using telescopes and specialized instruments, has been shown to be effective <!--in appropr selected: define--> for removal of these tumors without needing large incisions.<ref name=\"Nguyen2006\" /> The clinical issues of exact surgical indications for tumor size are controversial.

[[Histopathology|Histopathologists]] were unable to specifically distinguish between types we now know to be dissimilar molecularly. Subsequently, [[Cluster of differentiation|CD34]], and later CD117 were identified as markers that could distinguish the various types.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} Additionally, in the absence of specific therapy, the diagnostic categorization had only a limited influence on prognosis and therapy.\n\nThe understanding of GIST biology changed significantly with identification of the [[Molecular genetics|molecular basis]] of GIST,<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" />{{rp|1065}} particularly c-KIT. Historically, literature reviews prior to the molecular definition of GIST, and for a short time thereafter, asserted that 70-80% of GISTs were benign.<ref name=\"Burkill2003\" /><ref name=\"Nishida2000\" /><ref name=\"Miettinen2001\" /> The identification of a molecular basis for GIST led to the exclusion of many tumors that had been considered as GIST previously, and also the incorporation of a much larger number of tumors that had been labeled as other types of sarcomas and undifferentiated carcinomas.<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" />{{rp|1065}}  For example, some previous diagnoses of stomach and small bowel [[leiomyosarcoma]]s (malignant tumor of [[smooth muscle]]) would be reclassified as GISTs on the basis of immunohistochemical staining. All GIST tumors are now considered to have malignant potential, and no GIST tumor can be definitively classified as \"benign\".<ref name=\"Raut2008\" /> Hence, all GISTs are eligible for cancer staging in the AJCC (7th edition) / UICC.<ref>AJCC manual<!--will expand ref properly--></ref> Nonetheless, different GISTs have different risk assessments of their tendency to recur or to metastasize, dependent on their site of origin, size, and number of mitotic figures.<!--expand/merge from e/w in artic-->\n\nDue to the change in definition, clinical pathways of care before the year 2000 are largely uninformative in the current era.<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" />\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n<!--likely most are clinically 'silent'--><!--until v large-->GISTs may present with [[dysphagia|trouble swallowing]], [[gastrointestinal hemorrhage|gastrointestinal bleeding]], or [[metastasis|metastases]] (mainly in the liver). Intestinal obstruction is rare, due to the tumor's outward pattern of growth. Often, there is a history of vague [[abdominal pain]] or discomfort, and the tumor has become rather large by time the diagnosis is made.\n\n== Pathophysiology ==\nGISTs are tumors of [[connective tissue]], i.e. [[sarcoma]]s; unlike [[bowel cancer|most gastrointestinal tumor]]s, they are non[[epithelium|epithelial]]. About 70% occur in the [[stomach]], 20% in the [[small intestine]] and less than 10% in the [[esophagus]]. Small tumors are generally benign, especially when [[mitosis|cell division]] rate is slow, but large tumors disseminate to the [[liver]], [[Greater omentum|omentum]] and [[peritoneal cavity]]. They rarely occur in other abdominal organs.\n\nGISTs are thought to arise from [[interstitial cells of Cajal]] (ICC), that are normally part of the [[autonomic nervous system]] of the intestine.<ref name=\"Miettinen2006\" /> They serve a pacemaker function in controlling [[motility]].\n\n===Genetics===\nMost GISTs are sporadic. Less than 5% occur as part of [[genetic disorder|hereditary]] familial or idiopathic multitumor syndromes. These include, in descending order of frequency, [[neurofibromatosis]] Recklinghausen (NF-1), [[Carney's triad]] (gastric GIST, [[pulmonary]] [[chondroma]] and extra-[[adrenal]] [[paraganglioma]]), [[germline]] [[Gain-of-function mutation|gain-of-function]] [[mutation]]s in [[c-Kit]]/[[PDGFRA]], and the [[Carney's triad#Carney-Stratakis syndrome|Carney-Stratakis syndrome]].<ref name=\"Agaimy2010\" /> The Carney-Stratakis syndrome is a [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]] of hereditary GIST and paraganglioma, that is caused by germline mutations in the [[mitochondria]]l [[tumor suppressor gene]] pathway involving the [[succinate dehydrogenase]] (SDH) subunits [[SDHD]], [[Succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit C|SDHC]] and [[SDHB]].<ref name=\"Stratakis2009\" />\n\n=== c-KIT mutations ===\nApproximately 85% GISTs are associated with an abnormal ''[[c-KIT]]'' pathway. ''c-KIT'' is a gene that encodes for a [[transmembrane receptor]] for a growth factor termed [[stem cell factor]] (''scf''). The abnormal ''c-KIT'' pathway most commonly (85%) arises from [[mutation]]<!--usually [[Mutation#By inheritance|somatic]]/acquired, and only rarely inherited in familial forms--> of the gene itself; a smaller subset of c-KIT-associated GISTs are associated with [[constitutive activity]]<!--will tweak the relevant disambig page when time permits--> of the ''KIT'' [[enzymatic pathway]], found by [[immunoblotting]].<ref name=\"DeVita_2011_9\" />{{rp|1062}}  The c-KIT product/CD117 is expressed on ICCs and a large number of other cells, mainly [[bone marrow]] cells, [[mast cell]]s, [[melanocyte]]s and several others. In the gut, however, a mass staining positive for [[CD117]] is likely to be a GIST, arising from ICC cells.\n\nThe c-KIT [[molecule]] comprises a long [[Membrane protein|extracellular domain]], a [[Membrane protein|transmembrane segment]], and an intracellular part. Mutations generally occur in the [[deoxyribonucleic acid|DNA]] encoding the intracellular part (exon 11), which acts as a [[tyrosine kinase]] to activate other [[enzyme]]s. Mutations make c-KITfunction independent of activation by ''scf'', leading to a high cell division rate and possibly genomic instability. Additional mutations are likely \"required\" for a cell with a ''c-KIT'' mutation to develop into a GIST, but the ''c-KIT'' mutation is probably the first step of this process.\n\nMutations in the [[exon]]s 11, 9 and rarely 13 and 17 of the ''c-KIT'' gene are known to occur in GIST. The [[tyrosine kinase]] function of ''c-KIT'' is important in the medical therapy for GISTs, as described below. \n*KIT-D816V [[point mutation]]s in ''c-KIT'' exon 17 are responsible for resistance to targeted therapy drugs like [[imatinib mesylate]], a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n*KIT-p.D419del (exon 8) - A subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumors previously regarded as wild-type tumors carries somatic activating mutations in KIT exon 8 (p.D419del).<ref name=\"pmid23599150\">{{Cite journal | pmid = 23599150| year = 2013| last1 = Huss| first1 = S| title = A subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumors previously regarded as wild-type tumors carries somatic activating mutations in KIT exon 8 (p.D419del)| journal = Modern Pathology| volume = 26| issue = 7| pages = 1004\u201312| last2 = K\u00fcnstlinger| first2 = H| last3 = Wardelmann| first3 = E| last4 = Kleine| first4 = M.

The pathologist examines the [[histopathology]] to identify the characteristics of GISTs (spindle cells in 70-80%, epitheloid aspect in 20-30%). Smaller tumors can usually be confined to the muscularis propria layer of the intestinal wall.  Large ones grow, mainly outward, from the bowel wall until the point where they outstrip their blood supply and necrose (die) on the inside, forming a cavity that may eventually come to communicate with the bowel lumen.\n\nWhen GIST is suspected&mdash;as opposed to other causes for similar tumors&mdash;the pathologist can use [[immunohistochemistry]] (specific [[antibody|antibodies]] that stain the molecule [[CD117]] [also known as ''c-kit''] &mdash;see below). 95% of all GISTs are CD117-positive (other possible markers include [[CD34]], DOG-1, [[desmin]], and [[vimentin]]). Other cells that show CD117 positivity are [[mast cell]]s.\n\nIf the CD117 stain is negative and suspicion remains that the tumor is a GIST, the newer antibody DOG-1 (Discovered On GIST-1) can be used. Also [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] of Kit and PDGFRA can be used to prove the diagnosis.\n\n===Imaging===\nThe purpose of radiologic imaging is to locate the lesion, evaluate for signs of invasion and detect [[metastasis]]. Features of GIST vary depending on tumor size and organ of origin. The diameter can range from a few millimeters to more than 30&nbsp;cm.  Larger tumors usually cause symptoms in contrast to those found incidentally which tend to be smaller and have better prognosis.<ref name=\"Burkill2003\" /><ref name=\"Hersh2005\" /> Large tumors tend to exhibit [[cancer|malignant]] behavior but small GISTs may also demonstrate clinically aggressive behavior.<ref name=\"Pidhorecky2000\" />\n[[File:CT image of a GIST tumor in the gastric cardia.jpg|thumb|CT image of a GIST in the [[cardia|gastric cardia]].

Upper GI bleeding led to endoscopy, finding an ulcerated mass.]]\n[[File:GIST CT image.jpg|thumb|Non-enhanced CT image of a small GIST in the posterior stomach wall (arrow).  The lesion appears subserosal. Incidental finding.]]\n\n[[projectional radiography|Plain radiographs]] are not very helpful in the evaluation of GISTs. If an abnormality is seen, it will be an indirect sign due to the tumor mass effect on adjacent organs. On [[abdominal x-ray]], stomach GISTs may appear as a [[radiodensity|radiopaque]] mass altering the shape of the gastric air shadow. Intestinal GISTs may displace loops of bowel and larger tumors may obstruct the bowel and films will show an [[bowel obstruction|obstructive pattern]]. If [[cavitation]]s are present, plain radiographs will show collections of air within the tumor.<ref name=\"Shojaku1997\" /> [[Calcification]] is an unusual feature of GIST but if present can be visible on plain films.\n\n[[barium swallow|Barium fluoroscopic]] examinations and [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]] are commonly used to evaluate the patient with abdominal complaints. Barium swallow images show abnormalities in 80% of GIST cases.<ref name=\"Pidhorecky2000\" /> However, some GISTs may be located entirely outside the lumen of the bowel and will not be appreciated with a barium swallow. Even in cases when the barium swallow is abnormal, an MRI or CT scan must follow since it is impossible to evaluate abdominal cavities and other abdominal organs with a barium swallow alone. In a CT scan, abnormalities may be seen in 87% of patients and it should be made with both oral and intravenous contrast.<ref name=\"Pidhorecky2000\" />  Among imaging studies, MRI has the best tissue contrast, which aids in the identification of masses within the GI tract (intramural masses). Intravenous contrast material is needed to evaluate lesion vascularity.\n\nPreferred imaging modalities in the evaluation of GISTs are CT and MRI,<ref name=\"NCCN_STS_3_2012\" />{{rp|20\u201321}} and, in selected situations, endoscopic ultrasound. CT advantages include its ability to demonstrate evidence of nearby organ invasion, ascites, and metastases. The ability of MRI to produce images in multiple planes is helpful in determining the bowel as the organ of origin (which is difficult when the tumor is very large), facilitating diagnosis.<!--role of PET-->\n\n==== Small GISTs ====\nSince GISTs arise from the bowel layer called [[Muscular layer|muscularis propria]] (which is deeper to the [[Mucous membrane|mucosa]] and [[submucosa]] from a [[lumen (anatomy)|luminal]] perspective), small GIST imaging usually suggest a submucosal process or a mass within the bowel wall. In [[barium swallow]] studies, these GISTs most commonly present with smooth borders forming right or obtuse angles with the nearby bowel wall, as seen with any other intramural mass. The mucosal surface is usually intact except for areas of ulceration, which are generally present in 50% of GISTs. Ulcerations fill with barium causing a bull's eye or target lesion appearance. In contrast-enhanced [[X-ray computed tomography|CT]], small GISTs are seen as smooth, sharply defined intramural masses with homogeneous attenuation.\n\n==== Large GISTs ====\nAs the tumor grows it may project outside the bowel (exophytic growth) and/or inside the bowel (intraluminal growth), but they most commonly grow exophytically such that the bulk of the tumor projects into the abdominal cavity. If the tumor outstrips its blood supply, it can [[necrosis|necrose]] internally, creating a central fluid-filled cavity with bleeding and [[cavitation]]s that can eventually ulcerate and communicate into the [[lumen (anatomy)|lumen]] of the bowel. In that case, barium swallow may show an air, air-fluid levels or oral contrast media accumulation within these areas.<ref name=\"Pidhorecky2000\" /><ref name=\"Lehnert1998\" /> Mucosal ulcerations may also be present. In contrast enhanced CT images, large GISTs appear as heterogeneous masses due to areas of living tumor cells surrounding bleeding, necrosis or cysts, which is radiographically seen as a peripheral enhancement pattern with a low attenuation center.<ref name=\"Hersh2005\" /> In [[magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] studies, the degree of necrosis and bleeding affects the signal intensity pattern. Areas of bleeding within the tumor will vary its signal intensity depending on how long ago the bleeding occurred. The solid portions of the tumor are typically low signal intensity on [[Magnetic resonance imaging#T1-weighted MRI|T1-weighted images]], are high signal intensity on [[T2-weighted MRI|T2-weighted images]] and enhance after administration of [[gadolinium]]. Signal-intensity voids are present if there is gas within areas of necrotic tumor.<ref name=\"Shojaku1997\" /><ref name=\"Levine1996\" /><ref name=\"Tervahartiala1998\" />\n\n==== Features of malignancy ====\n[[cancer|Malignancy]] is characterized by local invasion and metastases, usually to the [[liver]], [[greater omentum|omentum]] and [[peritoneum]]. However, cases of metastases to bone, [[pleural cavity|pleura]], [[lung]]s and [[retroperitoneal space|retroperitoneum]] have been seen. In distinction to gastric [[adenocarcinoma]] or gastric/small bowel [[lymphoma]], malignant [[lymphadenopathy]] (swollen lymph nodes) is uncommon (&lt;10%) and thus imaging usually shows absence of lymph node enlargement.<ref name=\"Hersh2005\" /> If metastases are not present, other radiologic features suggesting malignancy include: size (&gt;5&nbsp;cm), heterogeneous enhancement after contrast administration and ulcerations.<ref name=\"Burkill2003\" /><ref name=\"Hersh2005\" /><ref name=ulusan >{{cite journal |vauthors=Ulusan S, Koc Z, Kayaselcuk F |title=Gastrointestinal stromal tumours: CT findings |journal=Br J Radiol |volume=81 |pages=618\u2013623 |year=2008 |pmid=18628330 |doi=10.1259/bjr/90134736 |issue=968}}</ref> Also, overtly malignant behavior (in distinction to malignant potential of lesser degree) is less commonly seen in gastric tumors, with a ratio of behaviorally benign to overtly malignant of 3-5:1.<ref name=\"Burkill2003\" /><!--check this is the right place for the current amended language herein--> Even if radiographic malignant features are present, these findings may also represent other tumors and definitive diagnosis must be made [[immunochemistry|immunochemically]].\n\n==Management==\n[[File:Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor.jpg|thumb|Image showing Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor after surgical removal]]\nLocalized, resectable adult GISTs, if  [[anatomy|anatomically]] and [[physiology|physiologically]] feasible, surgery is the primary treatment of choice.<ref name=\"NCCN_STS_3_2012\" />{{rp|69}} Surgery can be potentially curative, but watchful waiting may be considered in small tumors in carefully selected situations.<!--per European guidelines--><ref name=\"Casali2010\" /> Post-surgical adjuvant treatment may be recommended.<ref name=\"Bamboat2012\" /> Lymph node metastases are rare, and routine removal of lymph nodes is typically not necessary.<!--needs expln of exceptions, e.g. pediatric type--> Laparoscopic surgery, a minimally invasive abdominal surgery using telescopes and specialized instruments, has been shown to be effective <!--in appropr selected: define--> for removal of these tumors without needing large incisions.<ref name=\"Nguyen2006\" /> The clinical issues of exact surgical indications for tumor size are controversial.

This process [[Recycling|recycles]] various [[Organic matter|organic materials]] otherwise regarded as waste products and produces a [[soil conditioner]] (the ''compost'').\n\nCompost is rich in nutrients. It is used, for example, in [[garden]]s, [[landscaping]], [[horticulture]], [[urban agriculture]] and [[organic farming]]. The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a soil conditioner, a [[fertilizer]], addition of vital [[humus]] or [[humic acids]], and as a natural [[pesticide]] for soil. In [[ecosystems]], compost is useful for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover (see [[compost uses]]).\n\nAt the simplest level, the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter (also called [[green waste]]), such as leaves, grass, and food scraps, and waiting for the materials to break down into [[humus]] after a period of months. However, composting can also take place as a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The [[decomposition]] process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture when open piles or \"windrows\" are used. [[Fungus|Fungi]], [[earthworm]]s and other [[detritivore]]s further break up the material. Bacteria requiring oxygen to function ([[aerobic bacteria]]) and fungi manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, [[carbon dioxide]], and [[ammonium]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Fundamentals==\n[[File:Composting in the Escuela Barreales.jpg|thumb|Home compost barrel]]\n[[File:Compost pile.JPG|thumb|Materials in a compost pile]]\n[[File:Food-scraps-compost.jpg|thumb|Food scraps compost heap]]\n\nComposting is an ''aerobic method'' (meaning that it requires the presence of air) of decomposing organic solid wastes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3BhSAAAAMAAJ&q=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material&dq=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material|title=Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Science|last=Masters|first=Gilbert M.|date=1997|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780131553842|language=en}}</ref> It can therefore be used to recycle organic material.

There are many types of microorganisms found in active compost of which the most common are:<ref name=\"cornell\">{{cite web|url=http://compost.css.cornell.edu/microorg.html|title=Composting - Compost Microorganisms|work=[[Cornell University]]|accessdate=6 October 2010}}</ref>\n* [[Bacteria]]- The most numerous of all the [[microorganism]]s found in compost.  Depending on the phase of composting, [[mesophile|mesophilic]] or [[thermophile|thermophilic]] bacteria may predominate.\n* [[Actinobacteria]]- Necessary for breaking down paper products such as newspaper, [[Bark (botany)|bark]], etc.\n* [[Fungi]]- [[Mold|molds]] and [[yeast]] help break down materials that bacteria cannot, especially [[lignin]] in woody material.\n* [[Protozoa]]- Help consume bacteria, fungi and micro organic particulates.\n* [[Rotifers]]- Rotifers help control populations of bacteria and small protozoans.\n\nIn addition, [[earthworm]]s not only ingest partly composted material, but also continually re-create aeration and drainage tunnels as they move through the compost.\n\n===Phases of composting===\n[[File:Komposzt\u00e1l\u00f3.JPG|thumb|Three years old household compost]]\nUnder ideal conditions, composting proceeds through three major phases:<ref name=\"cornell\" />\n*'''Mesophilic phase:''' An initial, mesophilic phase, in which the decomposition is carried out under moderate temperatures by mesophilic microorganisms.\n*'''Thermophilic phase:''' As the temperature rises, a second, thermophilic phase starts, in which the decomposition is carried out by various thermophilic bacteria under high temperatures.\n*'''Maturation phase:''' As the supply of high-energy compounds dwindles, the temperature starts to decrease, and the mesophiles once again predominate in the maturation phase.\n\n===Slow and rapid composting===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nThere are many proponents of rapid composting that attempt to correct some of the perceived problems associated with traditional, slow composting. Many advocate that compost can be made in 2 to 3 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vric.ucdavis.edu/pdf/compost_rapidcompost.pdf|title=The Rapid Compost Method by Robert Raabe, Professor of Plant Pathology, Berkeley|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> Many such short processes involve a few changes to traditional methods, including smaller, more homogenized pieces in the compost, controlling carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) at 30 to 1 or less, and monitoring the moisture level more carefully. However, none of these parameters differ significantly from the early writings of compost researchers, suggesting that, in fact, modern composting has not made significant advances over the traditional methods that take a few months to work. For this reason and others, many scientists who deal with carbon transformations are skeptical that there is a \"super-charged\" way to get nature to make compost rapidly. {{citation needed|reason=Very old reference, find a better one|date=May 2015}}\n\nBoth sides may be right to some extent. The bacterial activity in rapid high heat methods breaks down the material to the extent that pathogens and seeds are destroyed, and the original feedstock is unrecognizable. At this stage, the compost can be used to prepare fields or other planting areas.  However, most professionals recommend that the compost be given time to cure before using in a nursery for starting seeds or growing young plants. The curing time allows fungi to continue the decomposition process and eliminating [[phytotoxic]] substances.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nAn alternative approach is anaerobic fermentation, known as [[#Bokashi|bokashi]]. It retains carbon bonds, is faster than decomposition, and for application to soil requires only rapid but thorough aeration rather than curing. It depends on sufficient carbohydrates in the treated material.\n\n===Pathogen removal===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nComposting can destroy [[pathogen]]s or unwanted [[seed]]s. Unwanted living plants (or [[weed]]s) can be discouraged by [[Mulch#Mulching (composting) over unwanted plants|covering with mulch/compost]]. The \"[[biopesticide|microbial pesticides]]\" in compost may include [[thermophile]]s and [[mesophile]]s.\n\nThermophilic (high-temperature) composting is well known to destroy many seeds and nearly all types of pathogens (exceptions may include [[prion]]s). The [[Disinfection|sanitizing]] qualities of ([[thermophilic]]) composting are desirable where there is a high likelihood of pathogens, such as with [[manure]].\n\n== Materials that can be composted ==\nComposting is a process used for [[resource recovery]]. It can [[recycle]] an unwanted by-product from another process (a [[waste]]) into a useful new product.\n\n=== Organic solid waste (green waste) ===\n[[File:Spontaneous combustion of compost pile.jpg|thumb|A large compost pile that is steaming with the heat generated by [[thermophile|thermophilic]] microorganisms.]]\n\nComposting is a process for converting decomposable organic materials into useful stable products. Therefore, valuable [[landfill]] space can be used for other wastes by composting these materials rather than dumping them on landfills. It may however be difficult to control inert and plastics contamination from [[municipal solid waste]].\n\nCo-composting is a technique that processes organic solid waste together with other input materials such as dewatered [[fecal sludge]] or [[sewage sludge]].<ref name=\"tilley2\" />\n\nIndustrial composting systems are being installed to treat organic solid waste and recycle it rather than landfilling it. It is one example of an [[advanced waste processing systems|advanced waste processing system]]. Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] digestion or in-vessel composting is called [[mechanical biological treatment]]. It is increasingly being used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills. Treating [[biodegradable waste]] before it enters a landfill reduces [[global warming]] from fugitive [[methane]]; untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill, producing [[landfill gas]] that contains [[atmospheric methane|methane]], a potent [[greenhouse gas]].\n\n===Animal manure and bedding===\nOn many farms, the basic composting ingredients are animal [[manure]] generated on the farm and bedding. Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non-traditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials - those low in nitrogen preferred, such as sawdust or straw.<ref>Dougherty, Mark. (1999). Field Guide to On-Farm Composting. Ithaca, New York: Natural Resource, Agriculture, and Engineering Service.</ref>\n\n=== Human waste and sewage sludge ===\n{{Further|Reuse of human waste}}\n[[Human waste]] can  be added as an input to the composting process since human excreta is a nitrogen-rich organic material. It can be either composted directly, as in [[composting toilets]], or indirectly (as [[sewage sludge]]), after it has undergone treatment in a [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]].  Feces contain a wide range of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and parasitic worms and its use in home composting can pose significant health risks.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Domestic waste composting facilities: a review of human health risks.|journal = Environment International|volume = 35|issue = 2|pages = 382\u20139|date = August 2012|pmid = 18701167|last1 = Domingo|first1 = J.

Unlike feces, urine does not attract disease-spreading flies (such as [[Housefly|houseflies]] or [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]]), and it does not contain the most hardy of pathogens, such as [[parasitic worm]] eggs.\n\n==Uses==\n{{Main|Uses of compost}}\nCompost can be used as an additive to soil, or other matrices such as [[coir]] and [[peat]], as a [[tilth]] improver, supplying humus and nutrients. It provides a rich ''growing medium'' as absorbent material (porous). This material contains moisture and soluble minerals, which provides support and [[nutrient]]s. Although it is rarely used alone, plants can flourish from mixed [[soil]], [[sand]], grit, bark chips, [[vermiculite]], [[perlite]], or [[clay]] granules to produce [[loam]]. Compost can be tilled directly into the soil or growing medium to boost the level of organic matter and the overall fertility of the soil. Compost that is ready to be used as an additive is dark brown or even black with an earthy smell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/rrr/greenscapes/pubs/asla-soil.pdf|title=Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|website=US EPA|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=2013-04-16}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, direct seeding into a compost is not recommended due to the speed with which it may dry and the possible presence of [[phytotoxin]]s in immature compost that may inhibit germination,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Morel | first1 = P. | last2 = Guillemain | first2 = G. | year = 2004 | title = Assessment of the possible phytotoxicity of a substrate using an easy and representative biotest | url = | journal = Acta Horticulturae | volume = | issue = 644| pages = 417\u2013423 | doi = 10.17660/ActaHortic.2004.644.55 }}</ref><ref>It\u00e4vaara et al.

It [[Homolactic fermentation|ferments]] (rather than decomposes) the input organic matter and feeds the result to the [[soil food web]] (rather than producing a soil conditioner). The process involves adding [[Lactobacillus|''Lactobacilli'']] to the input in an airtight container kept at normal room temperature. These bacteria ferment [[carbohydrate]]s to [[lactic acid]], which preserves the input. After this is complete the preserve is mixed into soil, converting the lactic acid to [[pyruvate]], which enables soil life to consume the result.\n\nBokashi is typically applied to [[food waste]] from households, workplaces and catering establishments, because such waste normally holds a good proportion of carbohydrates; it is also applied to other organic waste by supplementing carbohydrates. Household containers (\"bokashi bins\") typically give a batch size of {{convert|5\u201310|kg}}, accumulated over a few weeks. In horticultural settings batches can be orders of magnitude greater.[[File:Bokashi bin - inside.JPG|thumb|Inside a recently started bokashi bin. Food scraps are raised on a perforated plate (to drain runoff) and are partly covered by a layer of bran inoculated with ''Lactobacilli'']]\n\nBokashi offers several advantages:\n* Fermentation retains all the original carbon and energy. (In comparison, composting loses at least 50% of these and 75% or more in amateur use; composting also loses nitrogen, a [[Plant nutrition|macronutrient]] of plants, by emitting ammonia and the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide.)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Practical Handbook of Compost Engineering|last=Haug|first=Roger Tim|publisher=Lewis Publishers|year=1993|isbn=0-87371-373-7|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* Virtually the full range of food waste is accepted, without the exclusions of composting. The exception is large bones.\n* Being airtight, the container inherently traps smells, and when opened the smell of fermentation is far less offensive than decomposition. Hence bokashi bins usually operate indoors, in or near kitchens.\n* Similarly the container neither attracts insect pests nor allows them ingress.\n* The process is inherently hygienic because lactic acid is a natural [[bactericide]] and anti-[[pathogen]]; even its own fermentation is self-limiting.\n* Both preservation and consumption complete within a few weeks rather than months.\n* The preserve can be stored until needed, for example if ground is frozen or waterlogged.\n* The increased activity of the soil food web improves the soil texture, especially by worm action - in effect this is in-soil [[vermicomposting]].\n\nThe importance of the first advantage should not be underestimated: the mass of any [[ecosystem]] depends on the energy it captures. Plants depend upon the soil ecosystem making nutrients available within [[Soil#Water|soil water]]. Therefore, the richer the ecosystem, the richer the plants. (Plants can also take up nutrients from added chemicals, but these are at odds with the purpose of composting).\n\n=== Other systems at household level===\n==== {{anchor|H\u00fcgelkultur}}H\u00fcgelkultur (raised garden beds or mounds) ====\n[[File:End point (4315712587).jpg|thumb|upright|An almost completed H\u00fcgelkultur bed; the bed does not have soil on it yet.]]\n{{Main|H\u00fcgelkultur}}\nThe practice of making raised garden beds or mounds filled with rotting wood is also called ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' in German.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ |title=hugelkultur: the ultimate raised garden beds |publisher=Richsoil.com |date=2007-07-27 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref><ref name=\"permaculture.org.au\">{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.org.au/2010/08/03/the-art-and-science-of-making-a-hugelkultur-bed-transforming-woody-debris-into-a-garden-resource/ |title=The Art and Science of Making a Hugelkultur Bed - Transforming Woody Debris into a Garden Resource Permaculture Research Institute - Permaculture Forums, Courses, Information & News |date= 2010-08-03|accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref> It is in effect creating a [[nurse log]] that is covered with soil.\n\nBenefits of ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' garden beds include water retention and warming of soil.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.org.au/2012/01/04/hugelkultur-composting-whole-trees-with-ease/#more-6825 |title=Hugelkultur: Composting Whole Trees With Ease Permaculture Research Institute - Permaculture Forums, Courses, Information & News |date= 2012-01-04|accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref> Buried wood acts like a [[sponge (material)|sponge]] as it decomposes, able to capture water and store it for later use by crops planted on top of the ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' bed.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\" /><ref>Hemenway, Toby (2009).

Disadvantages (from the modern perspective) are that space is used for a whole year, some nutrients might be leached due to exposure to rainfall, and disease-producing organisms and insects may not be adequately controlled.\n\nComposting was somewhat modernized beginning in the 1920s in Europe as a tool for [[organic farming]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.extension.illinois.edu/homecompost/history.cfm|title=History of Composting|publisher=illinois.edu|accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref> The first industrial station for the transformation of urban organic materials into compost was set up in [[Wels]], Austria in the year 1921.<ref>Welser Anzeiger vom 05.

It is used, for example, in [[garden]]s, [[landscaping]], [[horticulture]], [[urban agriculture]] and [[organic farming]]. The compost itself is beneficial for the land in many ways, including as a soil conditioner, a [[fertilizer]], addition of vital [[humus]] or [[humic acids]], and as a natural [[pesticide]] for soil. In [[ecosystems]], compost is useful for erosion control, land and stream reclamation, wetland construction, and as landfill cover (see [[compost uses]]).\n\nAt the simplest level, the process of composting requires making a heap of wet organic matter (also called [[green waste]]), such as leaves, grass, and food scraps, and waiting for the materials to break down into [[humus]] after a period of months. However, composting can also take place as a multi-step, closely monitored process with measured inputs of water, air, and carbon- and nitrogen-rich materials. The [[decomposition]] process is aided by shredding the plant matter, adding water and ensuring proper aeration by regularly turning the mixture when open piles or \"windrows\" are used. [[Fungus|Fungi]], [[earthworm]]s and other [[detritivore]]s further break up the material. Bacteria requiring oxygen to function ([[aerobic bacteria]]) and fungi manage the chemical process by converting the inputs into heat, [[carbon dioxide]], and [[ammonium]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Fundamentals==\n[[File:Composting in the Escuela Barreales.jpg|thumb|Home compost barrel]]\n[[File:Compost pile.JPG|thumb|Materials in a compost pile]]\n[[File:Food-scraps-compost.jpg|thumb|Food scraps compost heap]]\n\nComposting is an ''aerobic method'' (meaning that it requires the presence of air) of decomposing organic solid wastes.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3BhSAAAAMAAJ&q=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material&dq=Human+waste+can+also+be+added+as+an+input+to+the+composting+process+since+human+waste+is+a+nitrogen-rich+organic+material|title=Introduction to Environmental Engineering and Science|last=Masters|first=Gilbert M.|date=1997|publisher=Prentice Hall|isbn=9780131553842|language=en}}</ref> It can therefore be used to recycle organic material.

Many advocate that compost can be made in 2 to 3 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vric.ucdavis.edu/pdf/compost_rapidcompost.pdf|title=The Rapid Compost Method by Robert Raabe, Professor of Plant Pathology, Berkeley|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> Many such short processes involve a few changes to traditional methods, including smaller, more homogenized pieces in the compost, controlling carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (C:N) at 30 to 1 or less, and monitoring the moisture level more carefully. However, none of these parameters differ significantly from the early writings of compost researchers, suggesting that, in fact, modern composting has not made significant advances over the traditional methods that take a few months to work. For this reason and others, many scientists who deal with carbon transformations are skeptical that there is a \"super-charged\" way to get nature to make compost rapidly. {{citation needed|reason=Very old reference, find a better one|date=May 2015}}\n\nBoth sides may be right to some extent. The bacterial activity in rapid high heat methods breaks down the material to the extent that pathogens and seeds are destroyed, and the original feedstock is unrecognizable. At this stage, the compost can be used to prepare fields or other planting areas.  However, most professionals recommend that the compost be given time to cure before using in a nursery for starting seeds or growing young plants. The curing time allows fungi to continue the decomposition process and eliminating [[phytotoxic]] substances.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nAn alternative approach is anaerobic fermentation, known as [[#Bokashi|bokashi]]. It retains carbon bonds, is faster than decomposition, and for application to soil requires only rapid but thorough aeration rather than curing. It depends on sufficient carbohydrates in the treated material.\n\n===Pathogen removal===\n{{More citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nComposting can destroy [[pathogen]]s or unwanted [[seed]]s. Unwanted living plants (or [[weed]]s) can be discouraged by [[Mulch#Mulching (composting) over unwanted plants|covering with mulch/compost]]. The \"[[biopesticide|microbial pesticides]]\" in compost may include [[thermophile]]s and [[mesophile]]s.\n\nThermophilic (high-temperature) composting is well known to destroy many seeds and nearly all types of pathogens (exceptions may include [[prion]]s). The [[Disinfection|sanitizing]] qualities of ([[thermophilic]]) composting are desirable where there is a high likelihood of pathogens, such as with [[manure]].\n\n== Materials that can be composted ==\nComposting is a process used for [[resource recovery]]. It can [[recycle]] an unwanted by-product from another process (a [[waste]]) into a useful new product.\n\n=== Organic solid waste (green waste) ===\n[[File:Spontaneous combustion of compost pile.jpg|thumb|A large compost pile that is steaming with the heat generated by [[thermophile|thermophilic]] microorganisms.]]\n\nComposting is a process for converting decomposable organic materials into useful stable products. Therefore, valuable [[landfill]] space can be used for other wastes by composting these materials rather than dumping them on landfills. It may however be difficult to control inert and plastics contamination from [[municipal solid waste]].\n\nCo-composting is a technique that processes organic solid waste together with other input materials such as dewatered [[fecal sludge]] or [[sewage sludge]].<ref name=\"tilley2\" />\n\nIndustrial composting systems are being installed to treat organic solid waste and recycle it rather than landfilling it. It is one example of an [[advanced waste processing systems|advanced waste processing system]]. Mechanical sorting of mixed waste streams combined with [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]] digestion or in-vessel composting is called [[mechanical biological treatment]]. It is increasingly being used in developed countries due to regulations controlling the amount of organic matter allowed in landfills. Treating [[biodegradable waste]] before it enters a landfill reduces [[global warming]] from fugitive [[methane]]; untreated waste breaks down anaerobically in a landfill, producing [[landfill gas]] that contains [[atmospheric methane|methane]], a potent [[greenhouse gas]].\n\n===Animal manure and bedding===\nOn many farms, the basic composting ingredients are animal [[manure]] generated on the farm and bedding. Straw and sawdust are common bedding materials. Non-traditional bedding materials are also used, including newspaper and chopped cardboard. The amount of manure composted on a livestock farm is often determined by cleaning schedules, land availability, and weather conditions. Each type of manure has its own physical, chemical, and biological characteristics. Cattle and horse manures, when mixed with bedding, possess good qualities for composting. Swine manure, which is very wet and usually not mixed with bedding material, must be mixed with straw or similar raw materials. Poultry manure also must be blended with carbonaceous materials - those low in nitrogen preferred, such as sawdust or straw.<ref>Dougherty, Mark. (1999). Field Guide to On-Farm Composting. Ithaca, New York: Natural Resource, Agriculture, and Engineering Service.</ref>\n\n=== Human waste and sewage sludge ===\n{{Further|Reuse of human waste}}\n[[Human waste]] can  be added as an input to the composting process since human excreta is a nitrogen-rich organic material. It can be either composted directly, as in [[composting toilets]], or indirectly (as [[sewage sludge]]), after it has undergone treatment in a [[Sewage treatment|sewage treatment plant]].  Feces contain a wide range of microorganisms including bacteria, viruses and parasitic worms and its use in home composting can pose significant health risks.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Domestic waste composting facilities: a review of human health risks.|journal = Environment International|volume = 35|issue = 2|pages = 382\u20139|date = August 2012|pmid = 18701167|last1 = Domingo|first1 = J.

Unlike feces, urine does not attract disease-spreading flies (such as [[Housefly|houseflies]] or [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]]), and it does not contain the most hardy of pathogens, such as [[parasitic worm]] eggs.\n\n==Uses==\n{{Main|Uses of compost}}\nCompost can be used as an additive to soil, or other matrices such as [[coir]] and [[peat]], as a [[tilth]] improver, supplying humus and nutrients. It provides a rich ''growing medium'' as absorbent material (porous). This material contains moisture and soluble minerals, which provides support and [[nutrient]]s. Although it is rarely used alone, plants can flourish from mixed [[soil]], [[sand]], grit, bark chips, [[vermiculite]], [[perlite]], or [[clay]] granules to produce [[loam]]. Compost can be tilled directly into the soil or growing medium to boost the level of organic matter and the overall fertility of the soil. Compost that is ready to be used as an additive is dark brown or even black with an earthy smell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/wastes/conserve/rrr/greenscapes/pubs/asla-soil.pdf|title=Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA,OSWER,ORCR|website=US EPA|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=2013-04-16}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, direct seeding into a compost is not recommended due to the speed with which it may dry and the possible presence of [[phytotoxin]]s in immature compost that may inhibit germination,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Morel | first1 = P. | last2 = Guillemain | first2 = G. | year = 2004 | title = Assessment of the possible phytotoxicity of a substrate using an easy and representative biotest | url = | journal = Acta Horticulturae | volume = | issue = 644| pages = 417\u2013423 | doi = 10.17660/ActaHortic.2004.644.55 }}</ref><ref>It\u00e4vaara et al.

It [[Homolactic fermentation|ferments]] (rather than decomposes) the input organic matter and feeds the result to the [[soil food web]] (rather than producing a soil conditioner). The process involves adding [[Lactobacillus|''Lactobacilli'']] to the input in an airtight container kept at normal room temperature. These bacteria ferment [[carbohydrate]]s to [[lactic acid]], which preserves the input. After this is complete the preserve is mixed into soil, converting the lactic acid to [[pyruvate]], which enables soil life to consume the result.\n\nBokashi is typically applied to [[food waste]] from households, workplaces and catering establishments, because such waste normally holds a good proportion of carbohydrates; it is also applied to other organic waste by supplementing carbohydrates. Household containers (\"bokashi bins\") typically give a batch size of {{convert|5\u201310|kg}}, accumulated over a few weeks. In horticultural settings batches can be orders of magnitude greater.[[File:Bokashi bin - inside.JPG|thumb|Inside a recently started bokashi bin. Food scraps are raised on a perforated plate (to drain runoff) and are partly covered by a layer of bran inoculated with ''Lactobacilli'']]\n\nBokashi offers several advantages:\n* Fermentation retains all the original carbon and energy. (In comparison, composting loses at least 50% of these and 75% or more in amateur use; composting also loses nitrogen, a [[Plant nutrition|macronutrient]] of plants, by emitting ammonia and the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide.)<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Practical Handbook of Compost Engineering|last=Haug|first=Roger Tim|publisher=Lewis Publishers|year=1993|isbn=0-87371-373-7|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n* Virtually the full range of food waste is accepted, without the exclusions of composting. The exception is large bones.\n* Being airtight, the container inherently traps smells, and when opened the smell of fermentation is far less offensive than decomposition. Hence bokashi bins usually operate indoors, in or near kitchens.\n* Similarly the container neither attracts insect pests nor allows them ingress.\n* The process is inherently hygienic because lactic acid is a natural [[bactericide]] and anti-[[pathogen]]; even its own fermentation is self-limiting.\n* Both preservation and consumption complete within a few weeks rather than months.\n* The preserve can be stored until needed, for example if ground is frozen or waterlogged.\n* The increased activity of the soil food web improves the soil texture, especially by worm action - in effect this is in-soil [[vermicomposting]].\n\nThe importance of the first advantage should not be underestimated: the mass of any [[ecosystem]] depends on the energy it captures. Plants depend upon the soil ecosystem making nutrients available within [[Soil#Water|soil water]]. Therefore, the richer the ecosystem, the richer the plants. (Plants can also take up nutrients from added chemicals, but these are at odds with the purpose of composting).\n\n=== Other systems at household level===\n==== {{anchor|H\u00fcgelkultur}}H\u00fcgelkultur (raised garden beds or mounds) ====\n[[File:End point (4315712587).jpg|thumb|upright|An almost completed H\u00fcgelkultur bed; the bed does not have soil on it yet.]]\n{{Main|H\u00fcgelkultur}}\nThe practice of making raised garden beds or mounds filled with rotting wood is also called ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' in German.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/ |title=hugelkultur: the ultimate raised garden beds |publisher=Richsoil.com |date=2007-07-27 |accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref><ref name=\"permaculture.org.au\">{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.org.au/2010/08/03/the-art-and-science-of-making-a-hugelkultur-bed-transforming-woody-debris-into-a-garden-resource/ |title=The Art and Science of Making a Hugelkultur Bed - Transforming Woody Debris into a Garden Resource Permaculture Research Institute - Permaculture Forums, Courses, Information & News |date= 2010-08-03|accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref> It is in effect creating a [[nurse log]] that is covered with soil.\n\nBenefits of ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' garden beds include water retention and warming of soil.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://permaculture.org.au/2012/01/04/hugelkultur-composting-whole-trees-with-ease/#more-6825 |title=Hugelkultur: Composting Whole Trees With Ease Permaculture Research Institute - Permaculture Forums, Courses, Information & News |date= 2012-01-04|accessdate=2013-07-18}}</ref> Buried wood acts like a [[sponge (material)|sponge]] as it decomposes, able to capture water and store it for later use by crops planted on top of the ''h\u00fcgelkultur'' bed.<ref name=\"richsoil.com\" /><ref>Hemenway, Toby (2009).

The advantage of this method is that little working time or effort is required from the composter and it fits in naturally with agricultural practices in temperate climates. Disadvantages (from the modern perspective) are that space is used for a whole year, some nutrients might be leached due to exposure to rainfall, and disease-producing organisms and insects may not be adequately controlled.\n\nComposting was somewhat modernized beginning in the 1920s in Europe as a tool for [[organic farming]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.extension.illinois.edu/homecompost/history.cfm|title=History of Composting|publisher=illinois.edu|accessdate=11 July 2016}}</ref> The first industrial station for the transformation of urban organic materials into compost was set up in [[Wels]], Austria in the year 1921.<ref>Welser Anzeiger vom 05.

Two preliminary designs were similar and were larger than the Hurricane.

Although the Typhoon was expected to achieve over {{convert|400|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in level flight at 20,000&nbsp;ft, the thick wings created a large drag rise and prevented higher speeds than the 410&nbsp;mph at {{convert|20000|ft|m}} achieved in tests.<ref>Mason 1988, p. 13.</ref>{{refn|This was a phenomenon called [[compressibility]] and [[wave drag]].<ref>Bentley 1975, p. 540.</ref>|group=nb}} The climb rate and performance above that level was also considered disappointing.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 15.</ref> When the Typhoon was dived at speeds of over {{convert|500|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the drag rise caused buffeting and trim changes.

As a result, development of the Typhoon was slowed, production plans were postponed and test flying continued at a reduced rate.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nAs a result of the delays the second prototype, ''P5216'', first flew on 3 May 1941: ''P5216'' carried an armament of four [[Belt (firearms)|belt-fed]] [[20 mm caliber|20&nbsp;mm]] (0.79&nbsp;in) [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano Mk II]] cannon, with 140 rounds per gun and was the prototype of the Typhoon IB series.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 16.\"/> In the interim between construction of the first and second prototypes, the Air Ministry had given Hawker an instruction to proceed with the construction of 1,000 of the new fighters. It was felt that the Vulture engine was more promising, so the order covered 500 [[Hawker Tornado|Tornadoes]] and 250 Typhoons, with the balance to be decided once the two had been compared. It was also decided that because Hawker was concentrating on Hurricane production, the Tornado would be built by [[Avro]] and [[Gloster Aircraft Company|Gloster]] would build the Typhoons at [[Hucclecote]].<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores, p. 13\"/> Avro and Gloster were aircraft companies within the [[Hawker Siddeley]] group.

This decision proved to be a disaster and several Typhoons were lost due to unknown causes and the Air Ministry began to consider halting production of the type.\n\nIn August 1942, Hawker's second test pilot, Ken Seth-Smith, while deputising for Chief Test Pilot Philip Lucas, carried out a straight and level speed test from Hawker's test centre at Langley, and the aircraft broke up over Thorpe, killing the pilot. Sydney Camm and the design team immediately ruled out pilot error, which had been suspected in earlier crashes. Investigation revealed that the elevator mass-balance had torn away from the fuselage structure. Intense flutter developed, the structure failed and the tail broke away. Modification 286 to the structure and the control runs partially solved the structural problem. (The 1940 Philip Lucas test flight incident had been due to an unrelated failing.) Mod 286, which involved fastening external fishplates, or reinforcing plates, around the tail of the aircraft, and eventually internal strengthening, was only a partial remedy, and there were still failures right up to the end of the Typhoon's service life. The Sabre engine was also a constant source of problems, notably in colder weather, when it was very difficult to start, and it suffered problems with wear of its [[sleeve valve]]s, with consequently high oil consumption. The 24-cylinder engine also produced a very high-pitched engine note, which pilots found very fatiguing.\n\nThe Typhoon did not begin to mature as a reliable aircraft until the end of 1942, when its excellent qualities \u2014 seen from the start by S/L [[Roland Beamont]] of 609 Squadron \u2014 became apparent. Beamont had worked as a Hawker production test pilot while resting from operations, and had stayed with Seth-Smith, having his first flight in the aircraft at that time. During late 1942 and early 1943, the Typhoon squadrons were based on airfields near the south and south-east coasts of England and, alongside two [[Supermarine Spitfire (Griffon-powered variants)|Spitfire XII squadrons]], countered the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s \"tip and run\" low-level nuisance raids, shooting down a score or more bomb-carrying Fw 190s. Typhoon squadrons kept at least one pair of aircraft on standing patrols over the south coast, with another pair kept at \"readiness\" (ready to take off within two minutes) throughout daylight hours. These sections of Typhoons flew at {{convert|500|ft}} or lower, with enough height to spot and then intercept the incoming enemy [[fighter-bomber]]s. The Typhoon finally proved itself in this role; for example, while flying patrols against these low-level raids, [[No. 486 Squadron RNZAF|486(NZ) Squadron]] claimed 20 fighter-bombers, plus three bombers shot down, between mid-October 1942 and mid-July 1943.<ref>Sortehaug 1998, pp. 339\u2013340.</ref>{{refn|486(NZ)Squadron started re-equipping with Typhoons in July 1942, initially using them as night fighters alongside [[Turbinlite]] [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Havocs]]. However, the Typhoon proved to be too fast for Turbinlite duties and 486 Sqn was quickly reassigned to the day fighter role.<ref>Sortehaug 1998, pp. 23, 30.</ref>|group=nb}}\n\nThe first two [[Messerschmitt Me 210]] fighter-bombers to be destroyed over the British Isles fell to the guns of Typhoons in August 1942.<ref>Ramsay 1990, 165.</ref> During a daylight raid by the ''Luftwaffe'' on London on 20 January 1943, four [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109G-4]]s and one Fw 190A-4 of [[Jagdgeschwader 26|JG 26]] were destroyed by Typhoons.<ref>Caldwell 2012, pp. 15\u201317.</ref> As soon as the aircraft entered service, it was apparent the profile of the Typhoon resembled a Fw 190 from some angles, which caused more than one [[friendly fire]] incident involving Allied anti-aircraft units and other fighters. This led to Typhoons first being marked up with all-white noses, and later with high visibility [[Invasion stripes#Hawker Typhoon|black and white stripes]] under the wings, a precursor of the markings applied to all Allied aircraft on D-Day.\n\n===Switch to ground attack===\n[[File:Hawker Typhoon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Rare wartime colour photograph of Typhoon JP736 No 175 Squadron at Westhampnett, Autumn 1943 showing the black and white  [[invasion stripes#Hawker Typhoon|identification stripes]] under the wings]]\nBy 1943, the RAF needed a [[Attack aircraft|ground attack]] fighter more than a \"pure\" fighter and the Typhoon was suited to the role (and less-suited to the pure fighter role than competing aircraft such as the Spitfire Mk IX). The powerful engine allowed the aircraft to carry a load of up to two {{convert|1,000|lb|kg}} bombs, equal to the [[light bomber]]s of only a few years earlier. The bomb-equipped aircraft were nicknamed \"Bombphoons\" and entered service with No. 181 Squadron, formed in September 1942.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 9.</ref>{{refn|The Typhoon's original bomb load of 500 lbs was doubled and then doubled again.<ref>Gunston 1980, p. 102.</ref>|group=nb}}\n\nFrom September 1943, Typhoons were also armed with four \"60 lb\" [[RP-3]] rockets under each wing.{{refn|A {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}}, {{convert|60|lb|kg}} [[high explosive]] warhead was the main version used on Typhoons.

Although the rocket projectiles were inaccurate and took considerable skill to aim and allow for [[External ballistics|ballistic drop]] after firing, \"the sheer firepower of just one Typhoon was equivalent to a destroyer's broadside.\"{{cn|date=November 2019}} By the end of 1943, eighteen rocket-equipped Typhoon squadrons formed the basis of the RAF [[Second Tactical Air Force]] (2nd TAF) ground attack arm in Europe. In theory, the rocket rails and bomb-racks were interchangeable; in practice, to simplify supply, some 2nd TAF Typhoon squadrons (such as 198 Squadron) used the rockets only, while other squadrons were armed exclusively with bombs (this also allowed individual units to more finely hone their skills with their assigned weapons).<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 16.</ref>\n\nBy the [[Normandy landings]] in June 1944, 2 TAF had eighteen operational squadrons of Typhoon IBs, while [[RAF Fighter Command]] had a further nine.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 58.</ref> The aircraft proved itself to be the most effective RAF tactical strike aircraft, on interdiction raids against communications and transport targets deep in North Western Europe prior to the invasion and in direct support of the Allied ground forces after D-Day. A system of close liaison with the ground troops was set up by the RAF and army: RAF radio operators in vehicles equipped with [[Very high frequency|VHF]] [[Transmitter|R/T]] travelled with the troops close to the front line and called up Typhoons operating in a \"[[Taxicab stand|Cab Rank]]\", which attacked the targets, marked for them by smoke shells fired by mortar or artillery, until they were destroyed.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 64.</ref>\n\n[[File:Typhoon IBs 198 Sqn RAF at Plumetot July 1944.jpg|thumb|left|[[No. 198 Squadron RAF|198 Sqn.]] Typhoons on airfield [[Advanced Landing Ground|B10/Plumetot]], France, in July 1944.

Analysis of destroyed tanks after the Normandy battle showed a \"hit-rate\" for the air-fired rockets of only 4%.<ref name=\"Shores and Thomas 2005\">Shores and Thomas 2005, pp. 240\u2013250.</ref> In [[Operation Goodwood]] (18 to 21 July), the 2nd Tactical Air Force claimed 257 tanks destroyed.<ref group=\"nb\">The 9th USAAF claimed a further 134 tanks</ref> A total of 222 were claimed by Typhoon pilots using rocket projectiles.<ref name=\"Mo07171\">Moore 2007, p. 171.</ref>  Once the area was secured, the British \"Operational Research Section 2\" analysts could confirm only ten out of the 456 knocked out German AFVs found in the area were attributable to Typhoons using rocket projectiles.<ref name=\"Mo07171\"/>{{sfn|Copp|2000|pp=399\u2013406}}\n\nAt [[Mortain]], in the [[Falaise pocket]], a German counter-attack that started on 7 August threatened [[George S. Patton|Patton]]'s break-out from the beachhead; this counter-attack was repulsed by 2nd Tactical Air Force Typhoons and the 9th USAAF. During the course of the battle, pilots of the 2nd Tactical Air Force and 9th USAAF claimed to have destroyed a combined total of 252 tanks.<ref>Zetterling 2000, p. 38.</ref> Only 177 German tanks and assault guns participated in the battle and only 46 were lost \u2013 of which nine were verified as destroyed by Typhoons, four percent of the total claimed.<ref>Zetterling 2000, pp. 38, 52.</ref>\n\nHowever, after-action studies at the time were based on random sampling of wrecks rather than exhaustive surveys, <ref>http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA951850</ref> and the degree of overclaim attributed to Typhoon pilots as a result was statistically improbable in view of the far lower known level of overclaim by Allied pilots in air-to-air combat, where claims were if anything more likely to be mistaken. Allied and German witness accounts of Typhoon attacks on German armour indicate that RPs did kill tanks with fair probability. Horst Weber, an SS panzergrenadier serving with Kampfgruppe Knaust south of Arnhem in the later stages of Operation Market Garden, recalled that, during a battle with British 43rd Wessex Division on 23 September 1944, 'We had four Tiger tanks and three Panther tanks... We were convinced that we would gain another victory here, that we would smash the enemy forces. But then Typhoons dropped these rockets on our tanks and shot all seven to bits. And we cried... We would see two black dots in the sky and that always meant rockets. Then the rockets would hit the tanks which would burn. The soldiers would come out all burnt and screaming with pain.' <ref>Beevor 2019, p.302</ref>  \n\nThe effect on the morale of German troops caught up in a Typhoon RP and cannon attack was decisive, with many tanks and vehicles being abandoned, in spite of superficial damage, such that, at Mortain, a signal from the German Army's Chief of Staff stated that the attack had been brought to a standstill by 13:00 '...due to the employment of fighter-bombers by the enemy, and the absence of our own air-support.'<ref>Thomas 2010, pp. 68\u201369.</ref> The 20&nbsp;mm cannon also destroyed a large number of (unarmoured) support vehicles, laden with fuel and ammunition for the armoured vehicles.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 68.</ref> On 10 July at Mortain, flying in support of the US 30th Infantry Division, Typhoons flew 294 sorties in the afternoon that day, firing 2,088 rockets and dropping {{convert|80|ST|MT}} of bombs.<ref>Hallion, Richard P. \"The U.S. Army Air Forces in World War II.\" ''Air Power Over the Normandy Beaches and Beyond'' (Air Force History and Museums Program), 1994.</ref> They engaged the German formations while the US 9th Air Force prevented German fighters from intervening. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the Supreme Allied Commander, said of the Typhoons; \"The chief credit in smashing the enemy's spearhead, however, must go to the rocket-firing Typhoon aircraft of the Second Tactical Air Force... The result of the strafing was that the enemy attack was effectively brought to a halt, and a threat was turned into a great victory.\"<ref>Grey and Cox 2002, p. 105.</ref>\n\nAnother form of attack carried out by Typhoons was \"Cloak and Dagger\" operations, using intelligence sources to target German HQs. One of the most effective of these was carried out on 24 October 1944, when 146 Typhoon Wing attacked a building in [[Dordrecht]], where senior members of the German 15th Army staff were meeting; 17 [[staff officer]]s and 36 other officers were killed and the operations of the 15th Army were adversely affected for some time afterwards.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 74.</ref>\n\n[[File:3 in RP 60 pdr Loading On Typhoon.jpg|thumb|Armourers loading RP-3 rockets with 60 lb High Explosive heads onto steel Mk.

On 3 May 1945, the ''[[Cap Arcona]]'', the ''[[SS Thielbek (1940)|Thielbek]]'' and the ''[[Deutschland IV|Deutschland]]'', large passenger ships in peacetime now in military service, were sunk in four attacks by RAF Hawker Typhoon 1Bs of [[No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group (United Kingdom)|No. 83 Group RAF]], [[2nd Tactical Air Force]]: the first by [[No. 184 Squadron RAF|184 Squadron]], second by [[No. 198 Squadron RAF|198 Squadron]] led by [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[John Robert Baldwin]], the third by [[No. 263 Squadron RAF|263 Squadron]] led by [[Squadron Leader]] Martin T.

Baldwin (609 Squadron and Commanding Officer 198 Squadron, 146 (Typhoon) Wing and 123 (Typhoon) Wing), who claimed 15 aircraft shot down from 1942 to 1944. Some 246 Axis aircraft were claimed by Typhoon pilots during the war.<ref>Thomas 1999</ref>\n\n3,317 Typhoons were built, almost all by [[Gloster Aircraft Company|Gloster]]. Hawker developed what was originally an improved '''Typhoon II''', but the differences between it and the Mk I were so great that it was effectively a different aircraft, and was renamed the [[Hawker Tempest]]. Once the war in Europe was over Typhoons were quickly removed from front-line squadrons; by October 1945 the Typhoon was no longer in operational use, with many of the wartime Typhoon units such as 198 Squadron being either disbanded or renumbered.<ref>Thomas 2000, p. 24.</ref><ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 181.</ref>\n\n===Captured Typhoons===\nBy 1943, with its change of role to ground attack, the Typhoon was constantly operating over enemy territory: inevitably some flyable examples fell into German hands. The first Typhoon to be flown by the ''Luftwaffe'' was ''EJ956'' '''SA-I''' of 486 (NZ) Sqn. On 23 March 1943, two aircraft flown by [[Flying officer|F/O]] Smith and [[Flight sergeant|F/S]] Mawson were on a \"Rhubarb\" over France.{{refn|A \"Rhubarb\" was a small scale attack on enemy ground targets of opportunity. Usually, these were undertaken by a section of two aircraft. Ideally, there would be a heavy cloud base at {{convert|2,000|\u2013|3,000|ft|m|abbr=on}}; should fighter opposition be too heavy it would be possible to pull up into the cloud.|group=nb}}  Just as they were crossing the coast at low altitude, Mawson's Typhoon was hit by light ''flak''. He managed to belly-land in a field near Cany-Barville but the aircraft was captured before he could destroy it. The Typhoon was repaired and test flown at [[Rechlin]] (a German equivalent to [[RAE Farnborough]]), and later served as T9+GK with \"[[Zirkus Rosarius]]\". EJ956 overturned and was written off during a forced landing near Meckelfeld, on 10 August 1944.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988\">Thomas and Shores 1988</ref><ref name=\"Sortehaug\"/> On 14 February 1944, another Typhoon was captured and later flown in Zirkus Rosarius. JP548 of [[No. 174 Squadron RAF|174 Squadron]] force landed after engine failure near Blois, France; the pilot, F/O Proddow evaded capture. This Typhoon crashed at Reinsehlen on 29 July 1944, killing Feldwebel Gold.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988\"/>\n\n==Modifications 1941\u20131945==\n[[File:Typhoonnew.jpg|right|thumb|A Charles E.

The photo gives a clear view of the \"car-door\" cockpit entry; the rear view mirror under a perspex blister can be seen on the hinged canopy roof.]]\nAs was usual with many front line Second World War RAF aircraft, the Typhoon was modified and updated regularly, so that a 1945 production example looked quite different from one built in 1941. In the last months of the war, a number of older aircraft were taken out of storage and overhauled, sometimes seeing active service for the first time; for example, R7771 was from one of the first production batches, built in 1942 with the car-door canopy and other early production features. This Typhoon was delivered to, and served on the [[Fighter Interception Unit]] in 1942.<ref>Mason 1991, p. 558.</ref> In February 1945 ''R7771'' was listed as being in front line service on [[No. 182 Squadron RAF|182 Sqn.]]; by then it was fitted with a clear-view \"bubble\" hood, rocket rails and other late series features.{{refn|''R7771'' is listed as being shot down by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]] on 28 February 1945. [[Warrant Officer|W/O]] F. W. Cuthbertson was killed.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 209.</ref>|group=nb}}\n\n===Carbon monoxide seepage===\nThe first problem encountered with the Typhoon after its entry into service was the seepage of [[carbon monoxide]] fumes into the cockpit. In an attempt to alleviate this, longer exhaust stubs were fitted in November 1941 (\"Mod [modification] 239\"), and at about the same time the port (left) cockpit doors were sealed. The Pilot's Notes for the Typhoon recommended that \"Unless Mod. No. 239 has been embodied it is most important that oxygen be used ''at all times'' as a precaution against [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].\"<ref>''Air Ministry'' 1943, p. 13.</ref> Despite the modifications, the problem was never entirely solved, and the standard procedure throughout the war was for Typhoon pilots to use oxygen from engine start-up to engine shut down.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 30.</ref> In addition to carbon monoxide seepage, pilots were experiencing unpleasantly high cockpit temperatures; eventually a ventilation tube helped alleviate, but did not solve the problem. In addition two small, rear opening vents were added below the port side radio hatch, just below the canopy.{{refn| In April 1943, [[Flight Lieutenant|F/L]] A. O. Moffet of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE Farnborough]] was attached to 486(NZ) Sqn in response to complaints about the overheated cockpits of the Typhoons. For a fortnight, \"Moff\" flew operationally with the unit. His tests showed that the cockpit temperatures could reach {{convert|135|F|C}}.<ref name =\"Wheeler 1963\">Wheeler 1963, pp. 80\u201386.</ref>|group=nb}}<ref name = \"Sortehaug\">Sortehaug 1998</ref>\n\n===Tail===\nA major problem, afflicting early production Typhoons in particular, was a series of structural failures leading to loss of the entire tail sections of some aircraft, mainly during high-speed dives. Eventually a combination of factors was identified, including harmonic vibration, which could quickly lead to metal fatigue, and a weak transport joint just forward of the horizontal tail unit. The loss of the tailplane of R7692 (having only 11 hours of flight recorded) on 11 August 1942, in the hands of an experienced test pilot (Seth-Smith), caused a major reassessment which concluded that the failure of the bracket holding the elevator mass balance [[Bellcrank|bell crank]] linkage had allowed unrestrained flutter which led to structural failure of the fuselage at the transport joint.\n\nStarting in September 1942, a steel strap was fitted internally across the rear fuselage transport joint, although this was soon superseded by Mod 286 (modification number 286), in which 20 alloy \"fishplates\" were riveted externally across the rear fuselage transport joint, while internally some of the rear fuselage frames were strengthened. This was a permanent measure designed to stop rear fuselage structural failures and was introduced on the production line from the 820th aircraft; between December 1942 and March 1943, all Typhoons without Mod 286 were taken out of service and modified. Modified balance weight assemblies were fitted from May 1943. Finally the entire unit was replaced with a redesigned assembly from August 1944.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 20.\">Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 20.</ref>\n\nAlthough these modifications reduced the numbers of Typhoons being lost due to tail assembly failure, towards the end of the Typhoon's life there were more tail failures, this time caused by a change to the undercarriage latch mechanism in late 1944; in high-speed flight the undercarriage fairings were pulled into the slipstream, creating an uneven airflow over the elevators and rudder resulting in tailplane and then rear fuselage structural failure.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 20.\"/> In total 25 aircraft were lost and 23 pilots killed due to tail failures.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 20.\"/>\n\n===Canopy===\n[[File:Hawker Typhoon 4 ExCC.jpg|thumb|Late model Typhoon of [[No. 440 Squadron RCAF|440 (RCAF) Squadron]].

The first 162 Typhoons featured a built-up metal-skinned dorsal fairing behind the pilot's armoured headrest; the mast for the radio aerial protruded through the fairing.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 16, 29.</ref> From mid- to late 1941 the solid metal aft dorsal fairing was replaced with a transparent structure (later nicknamed \"The Coffin Hood\"),<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 20.\"/> the pilot's head armour plate was modified to a triangular shape and the side cut-outs were fitted with armoured glass; the first production Typhoon to be fitted with this new structure was ''R7803''. All earlier aircraft were quickly withdrawn and modified. From early 1942 a rear-view mirror was mounted in a perspex blister moulded into the later \"car-door\" canopy roofs. This modification was not very successful, because the mirror was subject to vibration.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 21.\">Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 21.</ref> Despite the new canopy structure, the pilot's visibility was still restricted by the heavy frames and the clutter of equipment under the rear canopy; from August 1943, as an interim measure, pending the introduction of the new [[Bubble canopy|\"bubble\" canopy]] and cut-down dorsal fairing, the aerial mast and its associated bracing was removed and replaced with a whip aerial further back on the rear fuselage.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 10.</ref>\n\nStarting in January 1943, ''R8809'' was used to test a new, clear, one piece sliding \"bubble\" canopy and its associated new windscreen structure which had slimmer frames which, together with the \"cut-down\" rear dorsal fairing, provided a far superior all-around field of view to the car-door type. From November 1943 all production aircraft, starting with ''JR333'', were to be so fitted.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 21.\"/><ref name=\"Bentley 1975, p. 542.\"/> However, the complex modifications required to the fuselage and a long lead time for new components to reach the production line meant that it took some time before the new canopy became standard. To have as many Typhoons of 2nd TAF fitted before \"[[Operation Overlord]]\" conversion kits were produced and Gloster, Hawker and Cunliffe-Owen modified older Typhoons still fitted with the car-door canopy.<ref>Thomas 2009, pp. 10\u201311.</ref> {{refn|It is believed that the first modified Typhoon was ''R8843'' ''DJ-S'', flown by New Zealander [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Desmond J.

This enabled Typhoons to range deep into France, the Netherlands and Belgium. Some units, such as 609 Squadron and [[No. 198 Squadron RAF|198 Squadron]], were able to achieve notable success in air combat and ground attack operations using these long-range Typhoons.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 25.\">Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 25.</ref>\n\nAs production continued, the Typhoon's role changed from a low-level interceptor fighter to a fighter bomber. Racks capable of carrying {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bombs were fitted to the wings from October 1942 and were first used operationally by [[No. 181 Squadron RAF|181 Squadron]]. By mid-1943, all Typhoons off the production line were capable of carrying bombs. Bigger, solid rubber, grooved \"anti-shimmy\" tail wheel tyres were introduced in March 1943 on all Typhoons from the 1,001st production aircraft, ''EK238''. The new tyres helped to make heavier, bomb-laden Typhoons more manageable during ground manoeuvres. With the introduction of the bomb racks, small extensions were added to the cannon shell case ejector slots. These allowed the casings to drop clear of bombs or drop tanks suspended from the wing racks.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 23\">Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 23.</ref> Because of the vulnerability of the Typhoon's [[Water cooling|liquid-cooled engine]] cooling system to ground fire, some {{convert|780|lb}} of armour was added, lining the sides and bottom of the cockpit and engine compartments, as well as the [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] bath.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 11.</ref>\n\nWith the added weight of the bombs and armour, bigger [[disc brake|brake discs]] were fitted to the main wheels. At first this only applied to \"Bombphoons\", but eventually all Typhoons used these brakes. After tests conducted in 1943, it was determined that the Typhoon was capable of carrying a {{convert|1000|lb|adj=on}} bomb under each wing. With the increased load, it was decided that the extra take-off performance conferred by a four-bladed propeller was an advantage. This led to the adoption of a four-bladed propeller unit (de Havilland or [[Rotol]]) from early 1944. Coinciding with the new propeller, it was also decided that the larger tailplanes of the [[Hawker Tempest]] were to be fitted when tests showed that they improved the handling characteristics of the Typhoon when carrying {{convert|1000|lb|adj=on}} bombs.<ref name=\"Bentley 1975, p. 542.\">Bentley 1975, p. 542.</ref><ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 23, 24.</ref> Problems were experienced with oil seal leaks from the new propeller unit and a growing number of Typhoons were held in Maintenance Units (MUs) awaiting the arrival of new seals from the U.S. Some 200 Typhoons were manufactured with the new Tempest tails and the three-bladed propeller. A modification programme was inaugurated but it took several months before a majority of operational Typhoons had the four-bladed propeller and enlarged tailplane.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 15.</ref>{{refn|Early in its service life, the Typhoon airframe was prone to a high-frequency vibration while in flight, such that pilots reported that touching the cockpit walls was akin to receiving a mild electric shock.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 21, 23.</ref> Although not dangerous, it was uncomfortable, and a specially sprung seat was designed and fitted. With the introduction of the four-bladed propeller and larger tailplane it was found that not only was the performance and handling of the Typhoon enhanced, the vibration was much reduced.<ref name=\"Thos0912\">Thomas 2010, p. 12.</ref>|group=nb}}\n\nIn June 1943, Hawker fitted a Typhoon with four steel \"Mark I\" rocket rails under each wing. Trials at the [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment]] (A & AEE) and [[Air Fighting Development Unit]] (AFDU) showed that the combination of the [[RP-3]] rocket and the stable, high-speed platform of the Typhoon was promising. Carrying the eight rails and rockets, it was found that the top speed was reduced by {{convert|38|mph|abbr=on}}, with no adverse handling effects. As a result, the Mk I rails and RP-3s were first fitted to production aircraft of [[No. 181 Squadron RAF|181 Squadron]] in October 1943.<ref>Thomas 2010, pp. 13, 46.</ref> At first attempts were made to arm Typhoons with either bombs or rockets depending on requirements but it was soon decided that squadrons would specialise. By [[D-Day]], the 2nd TAF was able to field 11 RP (\"Rockphoon\") Typhoon squadrons and seven \"Bombphoon\" squadrons.<ref>Thomas 2010, pp. 16, 58, 88\u201390.</ref>\n\nLater in 1944, attempts were made to increase the firepower by \"double banking\" rockets on each rail, enabling the Typhoon to carry 16 rockets. The problems involved in operating Typhoons from 2nd TAF airstrips meant that this was not much used, although some Typhoons did fly operationally with 12 rockets, using double-banked rockets on the inner rails.<ref>Thomas 2000, p. 25.</ref> When extra range was required, Typhoons could also operate carrying a drop tank and two rockets outboard of the tank under each wing. From December 1944, aluminium \"Mark III\" rails, which weighed {{convert|240|lb}} per set, replaced the steel Mk Is, which weighed {{convert|480|lb}}.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 25-26.\">Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 25\u201326.</ref>{{refn|Starting in June 1944, new production Typhoons had the landing light in the leading edge of the port wing, although most units of 2 TAF omitted this feature and faired over the opening with a metal panel, giving the appearance that all production Typhoons were manufactured without the lights.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 20.</ref>|group=nb}}\n\nIn late 1943, Mk III IFF replaced the Mk I and the tailplane tip to fuselage [[Identification friend or foe]] (IFF) aerials were replaced by a \"[[bayonet]]\" aerial under the wing's centre section. A [[Beam Approach Beacon System]] (''Rebecca'') transponder unit was fitted in 1944, with the associated aerial appearing under the centre section.\n\nOnce Typhoons started operating from forward landing grounds in Normandy, it was found that the dust clouds stirred up by propeller wash consisted of over 80 percent of hard, abrasive material which was damaging the Sabre engines. The [[sleeve valve]]s in particular were subject to excessive wear and it was calculated that engines would last for three take-offs. As a result, a \"dome deflector\" was designed and manufactured at great speed by Napier, and within a week most Typhoons had been fitted with it. In operational service these mushroom-shaped [[air filter]]s, which became red hot, had a propensity for being blown off the air intake at high speed whenever a Sabre engine backfired. They were soon replaced by drum-shaped filters designed by the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] and Vokes. These had \"[[cuckoo clock]]\" doors in front, which swung open with the pressure changes caused by engine backfires. This standardised filter became Typhoon Mod.420.<ref name=\"Shores and Thomas 2008, p.602.\">Shores and Thomas 2008, p. 602.</ref>\n\nAt the end of June 1944, a decision was taken to fit tropical air filters as standard, similar to those fitted to the three Typhoons which had been sent to North Africa in 1943. One thousand sets of the filters were to be manufactured and fitted to front line Typhoons as Mod. 421. It was estimated that these could be fitted to all Typhoons on the production lines by the end of September. Research shows that late Typhoons starting in the ''RB---'' series were fitted with the filters, as were some rebuilt aircraft from earlier production batches. Mod. 421 appeared as a streamlined rectangular \"hump\", just behind the main radiator fairing and between the inner wheel doors, where the [[carburetor|updraught carburettor]] intake was located.<ref name=\"Shores and Thomas 2008, p.602.\"/>\n\nA small, elongated oval [[Pitot-static system|static port]] appeared on the rear starboard fuselage in late 1944. This was apparently used to more accurately measure the aircraft's altitude.\n\n[[File:Hawker Typhoon ExCC.jpg|thumb|A late production Typhoon with full RP-3 armament, on the later aluminium Mk III rails, using a mix of SAP/HE 60 lb warheads (outermost rail and third) and the HE fragmentation head introduced in early December 1944 (2nd and 4th rail); there are no landing lights on the leading edges of the wings.<ref>Thomas 2010, pp. 13\u201314.</ref>]]\n\nOne Typhoon, ''R8694'', was used by [[D. Napier & Son|Napier]] for trials with the more powerful Sabre IV, cooled using an annular radiator and driving a four-bladed propeller. The new engine and radiator arrangement required substantial modifications to the forward fuselage and engine bearer structures. Although a maximum speed of {{convert|452|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} was claimed by Napier, it was decided that the modifications would not be worthwhile, mainly because of the promising development of the Tempest, and because the disruption to Typhoon production would not be sufficiently outweighed by any benefit achieved.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 20\u201321.</ref><ref>[http://www.napierheritage.org.uk/spip.php?article100438 \"Napier Power Heritage.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212123126/http://www.napierheritage.org.uk/spip.php?article100438 |date=12 February 2009 }} ''napierheritage.org.''

(''[[Airborne interception radar|Airborne Interception]]'', i.e., [[radar]]) equipment, a special night-flying cockpit and other modifications.\nAlso in 1943, five Typhoons<ref group=\"nb\">''R8889'', ''R8891'', ''R8925'', ''DN323'' and ''EJ906''</ref> were modified to \"Tropical\" standard by fitting of an air filter in a fairing behind the main radiator housing. Three<ref group=\"nb\">''R8891'', ''DN323'' and ''EJ906''</ref> underwent trials in Egypt with [[No. 451 Squadron RAAF|451 (RAAF) Squadron]] during 1943.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988\"/>\n\nThe Typhoon FR IB was developed in early 1944 and was used as a tactical reconnaissance fighter. In this version the port inner cannon was removed and three (one forward-facing {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} and two vertical five-inch) [[F24 camera]]s were carried in its place.{{refn|Pilots soon discovered that the aircraft yawed to the left when the cannon were fired because the recoil of the two cannon on the starboard wing was not properly balanced by the single cannon to port; as a result the starboard inner cannon was also removed from some aircraft.|group=nb}} Few FR IBs were built, and most served with [[No. 268 Squadron RAF|268 Squadron]], starting in July 1944. The aircraft was never popular with the pilots, who preferred the older [[North American P-51 Mustang|Mustang Is and IAs]], and the inherent engine and airframe vibrations meant that photos were invariably blurred. As a consequence of these problems, the FR IB was phased out in January 1945.\n\nIn 1941, Hawker tendered the Hawker P.1009 \"Fleet Fighter\" in response to [[List of Air Ministry Specifications#1930-1939|specification '''N.11/40''']] for a carrier-based fighter. A new centre section was to be fitted, extending the wingspan to over {{convert|45|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and thus increasing the wing area; the wings themselves were to be [[Folding wing|folding units]], which swung and folded parallel to the fuselage, with the leading edges pointing upwards, much like the folding wings on the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]]. The rear fuselage was to be longer and a v-style [[Tailhook|arrestor hook]] and associated [[Aircraft catapult|catapult-launching]] gear was to be fitted. The design chosen was to result in the postwar [[Blackburn Firebrand]] design.<ref>Mason 1991, p. 642.</ref>\n\n==Flight characteristics==\n[[File:A Hawker Typhoon Mk IB of No. 486 Squadron RAF, 27 October 1943. CH11578.jpg|thumbnail|right|A Hawker Typhoon Mk IB of No. 486 Squadron RAF in flight, in 1943]]\nFlight Lieutenant Ken Trott flew Typhoons with 197 Squadron and recalled:\n\n{{quote|Rather a large aircraft shall we say, for a single-engine fighter. Terrific power. Quite something to control. I liked it from the point of view of speed and being a very stable gun platform. You could come in on a target at 400 mph and the thing was as steady as a rock.<ref name= \"Darlow p. 49.\">Darlow 2005, p. 49.</ref>}}\n\nIn early March 1943, at [[RAF Tangmere|Tangmere]], the then new Squadron Leader of 486 (NZ) Squadron, Des Scott, flew a Typhoon for the first time:\n\n{{quote|She roared, screamed, groaned and whined, but apart from being rather heavy on the controls at high speeds she came through her tests with flying colours...Applying a few degrees of flap we swung on down into the airfield approach, levelled out above the runway and softly eased down on to her two wheels, leaving her tail up until she dropped it of her own accord.\n\nWe were soon back in her bay by the dispersal hut, where I turned off the petrol supply cock. After a few moments she ran herself out and with a spit, sob and weary sigh, her great three-bladed propeller came to a stop. So that was it: I was drenched in perspiration and tired out...<ref name =\"Scott 1983.\">Scott 1983, pp. 15\u201317.</ref>}}\n\nThe performance limitations for speed were noted on the pilot's notes, published by the Air Ministry. [[Indicated airspeed]] for diving was set at {{convert|525|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The Typhoon could, if needed, be flown at {{convert|300|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} with the cockpit \"hood\" open. Flight with undercarriage and flaps down could be made without incident, at the respective speeds of {{convert|210|and|155|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Owing to stability problems, when the aircraft was carrying bombs, the speed could not exceed 400&nbsp;mph.<ref>Air Ministry 1945, p. 26 (I A and I B notes).</ref>\n\nNotes for the management of the fuel system stated that indicated airspeeds (IAS) in excess of {{convert|380|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} were not advisable when fitted with auxiliary drop tanks. Tanks were jettisoned at about {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, but in an emergency, a release at {{convert|350|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} was permitted. Tanks were to be ejected in straight and level flight only.<ref>Air Ministry 1945, p. 12 (I A and I B notes).</ref> General flying ability was positive. The maximum climbing rate was {{convert|185|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} up to {{convert|16000|ft|m|abbr=on}} reducing speed by {{convert|3|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} per {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} above this mark. In stability terms, the aircraft was stable \"directionally\" and \"laterally\" but slightly unstable longitudinally, except at high speed, when it was just stable. [[Aileron]] control was light and effective up to maximum speed, but at very low speed response was sluggish, particularly when carrying ordnance. The elevator control was rather light and should not be used harshly. There was a tendency to \"tighten up\" in a looping aircraft. If \"black out\" conditions were accidentally induced in steep turns or aerobatics, the control column was to be pushed forward \"firmly\".<ref>''Air Ministry'' 1945, p. 18 (I A and I B notes).</ref>\n\nStalling speeds were quite low. The typical Typhoon trait, as with most aircraft at the time, was to drop a wing sharply with flaps either up or down. The stalling speeds varied. The various loads depended on external fittings. All-up weight plus two {{convert|500|lb|abbr=on}} bombs (12,155&nbsp;lb in total) with flaps up could induce a stall at 90\u2013100&nbsp;mph. With flaps down, stall was initiated at 70\u201375&nbsp;mph. Normal all-up weight (11,120&nbsp;lb) would see stall at 80\u201390 and 65\u201370&nbsp;mph respectively. With all ammunition and nearly all fuel expended (9,600&nbsp;lb) stall occurred at 75\u201380 and 65\u201370&nbsp;mph.<ref>''Air Ministry'' 1945, p. 19 (I A and I B notes).</ref>\n\n==Operators==\n{{Main|List of Hawker Typhoon operators}}\n\n*{{Flag icon|AUS}} [[Australia]]\n*{{Flag icon|Canada|1921}} [[Canada]]\n*{{Flag icon|NZL}} [[New Zealand]]\n*{{Flag icon|UK}} [[United Kingdom]]\n\n==Surviving aircraft==\n[[File:Hawker Typhoon at RAF Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Hawker Typhoon ''MN235'' RAF Museum]]\n\nOnly one complete Hawker Typhoon still survives \u2013 [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''MN235''.

It was intended to be a medium\u2013high altitude [[interceptor aircraft|interceptor]], as a replacement for the [[Hawker Hurricane]] but several design problems were encountered and it never completely satisfied this requirement.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 16.\">Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 16.</ref>\n\nThe Typhoon was originally designed to mount twelve [[.303 British|.303 inch (7.7 mm)]] [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Browning machine guns]] and be powered by the latest 2,000&nbsp;hp engines. Its service introduction in mid-1941 was plagued with problems and for several months the aircraft faced a doubtful future.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 16.\"/> When the ''Luftwaffe'' brought the formidable [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] into service in 1941, the Typhoon was the only RAF fighter capable of catching it at low altitudes; as a result it secured a new role as a low-altitude interceptor.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 35\u201336.</ref>\n\nThe Typhoon became established in roles such as night-time intruder and long-range fighter.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 34.</ref> From late 1942 the Typhoon was equipped with bombs and from late 1943 [[RP-3]] rockets were added to its armoury. With those weapons and its four [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|20mm Hispano]] autocannons, the Typhoon became one of the Second World War's most successful [[ground-attack aircraft]].<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 23\u201326.</ref>\n\n==Design and development==\n\n===Origins===\n[[File:Typhoon prototype1.jpg|thumb|The unarmed first prototype Typhoon P5212 taken just before its first flight. The prototype had a small tail unit and a solid fairing behind the cockpit, which was fitted with \"car door\" style access hatches; no inner wheel doors were fitted and the Sabre engine used three exhaust stubs either side of the cowling.]]\nEven before Hurricane production began in March 1937, [[Sydney Camm]] had embarked on designing its successor. Two preliminary designs were similar and were larger than the Hurricane. These later became known as the \"N\" and \"R\" (from the initial of the engine manufacturers), because they were designed for the newly developed [[Napier Sabre]] and [[Rolls-Royce Vulture]] engines respectively.<ref name=\"Mason 1991, p. 316\">Mason 1991, p. 316.</ref> Both engines used 24 cylinders and were designed for over {{convert|2,000|hp|kW|abbr=on}}; the difference between the two was primarily in the arrangement of the cylinders \u2013 an [[H engine|H-block]] in the Sabre and an [[X engine|X-block]] in the Vulture.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 12.\">Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 12.</ref> Hawker submitted these preliminary designs in July 1937 but were advised to wait until a formal specification for a new fighter was issued.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 12.\"/>\n\nIn March 1938, Hawker received from the [[Air Ministry]], [[List of Air Ministry Specifications#1930-1939|Specification F.18/37]] for a fighter which would be able to achieve at least {{convert|400|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at {{convert|15000|ft|m}} and specified a British engine with a [[Supercharger|two-speed supercharger]]. The armament fitted was to be twelve .303 inch Browning machine guns with 500 rounds per gun, with a provision for alternative combinations of weaponry.<ref>Meekcoms and Morgan 1994, p. 249.</ref> Camm and his design team started formal development of the designs and construction of prototypes.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 12.\"/>{{refn|The \"R\" Tornado prototype, which flew before that of the Typhoon, could be identified by its ventral radiator unit and slightly rounder nose profile with a carburettor intake on top of the nose and two sets of exhaust stacks on either side of the engine cowling.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 12\u201313</ref>|group=nb}}\n\nThe basic design of the Typhoon was a combination of traditional Hawker construction (such as used in the earlier [[Hawker Hurricane]]) and more modern construction techniques; the front fuselage structure, from the engine mountings to the rear of the cockpit, was made up of bolted and welded [[duralumin]] or steel tubes covered with skin panels, while the rear fuselage was a flush-riveted, semi-[[monocoque]] structure.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 12.\"/>{{refn|The Typhoon and Tornado's forward fuselage structure was a refinement of techniques first developed by [[Fred Sigrist]] and Camm in 1925.<ref>Mason 1991, p. 15.</ref>|group=nb}} The forward fuselage and cockpit skinning was made up of large, removable duralumin panels, allowing easy external access to the engine and engine accessories and most of the important hydraulic and electrical equipment.<ref name=\"Bentley 1975, p. 545.\">Bentley 1975, p. 545.</ref><ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe wing had a span of {{convert|41|ft|7|in|m|adj=off}}, with a wing area of 279 sq ft (29.6 sq m).<ref>Mason 1991, p. 328.</ref> It was designed with a small amount of inverted [[gull wing]] bend; the inner sections had a 1\u00b0 [[Dihedral (aircraft)#Anhedral|anhedral]], while the outer sections, attached just outboard of the undercarriage legs, had a [[Dihedral (aircraft)|dihedral]] of 5\u00bd\u00b0.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 12.\"/> The airfoil was a [[NACA airfoil|NACA 22 wing section]], with a [[thickness-to-chord ratio]] of 19.5% at the root tapering to 12% at the tip.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 105.</ref>\n\nThe wing possessed great structural strength, provided plenty of room for fuel tanks and a heavy armament, while allowing the aircraft to be a steady gun platform.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 12, 15.</ref> Each of the inner wings incorporated two fuel tanks; the \"main\" tanks, housed in a bay outboard and to the rear of the main undercarriage bays, had a capacity of 40 gallons; while the \"nose\" tanks, built into the wing leading edges, forward of the main spar, had a capacity of 37 gallons each.<ref name=\"Bentley 1975, p. 545.\">Bentley 1975, p. 545.</ref><ref>Air Ministry 1943/2004, p. 5.</ref> Also incorporated into the inner wings were inward-retracting [[landing gear]] with a wide track of 13&nbsp;ft 6\u00be in.<ref>Mason 1991, p. 329.</ref>\n\nBy contemporary standards, the new design's wing was very \"thick\", similar to the Hurricane before it. Although the Typhoon was expected to achieve over {{convert|400|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in level flight at 20,000&nbsp;ft, the thick wings created a large drag rise and prevented higher speeds than the 410&nbsp;mph at {{convert|20000|ft|m}} achieved in tests.<ref>Mason 1988, p. 13.</ref>{{refn|This was a phenomenon called [[compressibility]] and [[wave drag]].<ref>Bentley 1975, p. 540.</ref>|group=nb}} The climb rate and performance above that level was also considered disappointing.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 15.</ref> When the Typhoon was dived at speeds of over {{convert|500|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the drag rise caused buffeting and trim changes. These [[High-speed flight|compressibility]] problems led to Camm designing the Typhoon II, later known as the [[Hawker Tempest|Tempest]], which used much thinner wings with a [[laminar flow]] airfoil.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 18, 105.</ref>\n\n===Prototypes===\n[[File:Typhoon 2nd prototype 1.jpg|thumb|right|The second prototype P5216 in the standard RAF camouflage of 1941, possibly with yellow undersurfaces. The retractable tailwheel and main wheels now had doors fitted. Six exhaust stubs and the later standardised four cannon armament were other changes from P5212.]]\nThe first flight of the first Typhoon prototype, ''P5212'', made by Hawker's Chief test Pilot [[Philip Lucas]] from [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]], was delayed until 24 February 1940 because of the problems with the development of the Sabre engine. Although unarmed for its first flights, ''P5212'' later carried 12 [[.303 British|.303 in]] (7.7&nbsp;mm) [[M1919 Browning machine gun|Brownings]], set in groups of six in each outer wing panel; this was the armament fitted to the first 110 Typhoons, known as the Typhoon IA.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 16.\"/>{{refn|Although the four cannon were the preferred armament there was a shortage of the Ch\u00e2telleraut cannon feed mechanism. Some Typhoon IAs were later converted to IB standard.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 16.\"/>|group=nb}} ''P5212'' also had a small tail-fin, triple exhaust stubs and no wheel doors fitted to the centre-section.<ref name=\"Mason 1991, p. 316\"/> On 9 May 1940 the prototype had a mid-air [[Structural integrity and failure|structural failure]], at the join between the forward fuselage and rear fuselage, just behind the pilot's seat. Philip Lucas could see daylight through the split but instead of bailing out, landed the Typhoon and was later awarded the [[George Medal]].<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores, p. 13\">Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 13.</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35156 |supp=y|page=2643|date=6 May 1941}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 May, the [[Minister of Aircraft Production]], [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]], ordered that resources should be concentrated on the production of five main aircraft types (the Spitfire and Hurricane fighters and the [[Armstrong Whitworth Whitley|Whitley]], [[Vickers Wellington|Wellington]] and [[Bristol Blenheim|Blenheim]] bombers). As a result, development of the Typhoon was slowed, production plans were postponed and test flying continued at a reduced rate.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 13\u201314.</ref>\n\nAs a result of the delays the second prototype, ''P5216'', first flew on 3 May 1941: ''P5216'' carried an armament of four [[Belt (firearms)|belt-fed]] [[20 mm caliber|20&nbsp;mm]] (0.79&nbsp;in) [[Hispano-Suiza HS.404|Hispano Mk II]] cannon, with 140 rounds per gun and was the prototype of the Typhoon IB series.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 16.\"/> In the interim between construction of the first and second prototypes, the Air Ministry had given Hawker an instruction to proceed with the construction of 1,000 of the new fighters. It was felt that the Vulture engine was more promising, so the order covered 500 [[Hawker Tornado|Tornadoes]] and 250 Typhoons, with the balance to be decided once the two had been compared. It was also decided that because Hawker was concentrating on Hurricane production, the Tornado would be built by [[Avro]] and [[Gloster Aircraft Company|Gloster]] would build the Typhoons at [[Hucclecote]].<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores, p. 13\"/> Avro and Gloster were aircraft companies within the [[Hawker Siddeley]] group. As a result of good progress by Gloster, the first production Typhoon ''R7576'' was first flown on 27 May 1941 by [[Michael Daunt]], just over three weeks after the second prototype.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 16.\"/>\n\n==Operational service==\n\n===Low-level interceptor ===\n[[File:Pheloung 1.jpg|right|thumb|A Mark IB Typhoon ''US-A'' in April 1943. It was flown by [[Squadron Leader]] T.H.V Pheloung (New Zealand).<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988\"/>{{refn|On 20 June 1943, Sqn Ldr Pheloung flying ''EK184'', ''US-C'', was hit by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]] and crashed into the sea while attacking shipping.|group=nb}} An {{convert|18|in|mm|adj=mid|-wide}} yellow recognition stripe is visible on the upper wing.]]\nIn 1941, the [[Spitfire V]]s, which equipped the bulk of Fighter Command squadrons, were outclassed by the new [[Focke-Wulf Fw 190]] and suffered many losses. The Typhoon was rushed into service with Nos. [[No. 56 Squadron RAF|56]] and [[No. 609 Squadron RAF|609]] Squadrons in late 1941, to counter the Fw 190. This decision proved to be a disaster and several Typhoons were lost due to unknown causes and the Air Ministry began to consider halting production of the type.\n\nIn August 1942, Hawker's second test pilot, Ken Seth-Smith, while deputising for Chief Test Pilot Philip Lucas, carried out a straight and level speed test from Hawker's test centre at Langley, and the aircraft broke up over Thorpe, killing the pilot. Sydney Camm and the design team immediately ruled out pilot error, which had been suspected in earlier crashes. Investigation revealed that the elevator mass-balance had torn away from the fuselage structure. Intense flutter developed, the structure failed and the tail broke away. Modification 286 to the structure and the control runs partially solved the structural problem. (The 1940 Philip Lucas test flight incident had been due to an unrelated failing.) Mod 286, which involved fastening external fishplates, or reinforcing plates, around the tail of the aircraft, and eventually internal strengthening, was only a partial remedy, and there were still failures right up to the end of the Typhoon's service life. The Sabre engine was also a constant source of problems, notably in colder weather, when it was very difficult to start, and it suffered problems with wear of its [[sleeve valve]]s, with consequently high oil consumption. The 24-cylinder engine also produced a very high-pitched engine note, which pilots found very fatiguing.\n\nThe Typhoon did not begin to mature as a reliable aircraft until the end of 1942, when its excellent qualities \u2014 seen from the start by S/L [[Roland Beamont]] of 609 Squadron \u2014 became apparent. Beamont had worked as a Hawker production test pilot while resting from operations, and had stayed with Seth-Smith, having his first flight in the aircraft at that time. During late 1942 and early 1943, the Typhoon squadrons were based on airfields near the south and south-east coasts of England and, alongside two [[Supermarine Spitfire (Griffon-powered variants)|Spitfire XII squadrons]], countered the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s \"tip and run\" low-level nuisance raids, shooting down a score or more bomb-carrying Fw 190s. Typhoon squadrons kept at least one pair of aircraft on standing patrols over the south coast, with another pair kept at \"readiness\" (ready to take off within two minutes) throughout daylight hours. These sections of Typhoons flew at {{convert|500|ft}} or lower, with enough height to spot and then intercept the incoming enemy [[fighter-bomber]]s. The Typhoon finally proved itself in this role; for example, while flying patrols against these low-level raids, [[No. 486 Squadron RNZAF|486(NZ) Squadron]] claimed 20 fighter-bombers, plus three bombers shot down, between mid-October 1942 and mid-July 1943.<ref>Sortehaug 1998, pp. 339\u2013340.</ref>{{refn|486(NZ)Squadron started re-equipping with Typhoons in July 1942, initially using them as night fighters alongside [[Turbinlite]] [[Douglas A-20 Havoc|Havocs]]. However, the Typhoon proved to be too fast for Turbinlite duties and 486 Sqn was quickly reassigned to the day fighter role.<ref>Sortehaug 1998, pp. 23, 30.</ref>|group=nb}}\n\nThe first two [[Messerschmitt Me 210]] fighter-bombers to be destroyed over the British Isles fell to the guns of Typhoons in August 1942.<ref>Ramsay 1990, 165.</ref> During a daylight raid by the ''Luftwaffe'' on London on 20 January 1943, four [[Messerschmitt Bf 109|Bf 109G-4]]s and one Fw 190A-4 of [[Jagdgeschwader 26|JG 26]] were destroyed by Typhoons.<ref>Caldwell 2012, pp. 15\u201317.</ref> As soon as the aircraft entered service, it was apparent the profile of the Typhoon resembled a Fw 190 from some angles, which caused more than one [[friendly fire]] incident involving Allied anti-aircraft units and other fighters. This led to Typhoons first being marked up with all-white noses, and later with high visibility [[Invasion stripes#Hawker Typhoon|black and white stripes]] under the wings, a precursor of the markings applied to all Allied aircraft on D-Day.\n\n===Switch to ground attack===\n[[File:Hawker Typhoon.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Rare wartime colour photograph of Typhoon JP736 No 175 Squadron at Westhampnett, Autumn 1943 showing the black and white  [[invasion stripes#Typhoon|identification stripes]] under the wings]]\nBy 1943, the RAF needed a [[Attack aircraft|ground attack]] fighter more than a \"pure\" fighter and the Typhoon was suited to the role (and less-suited to the pure fighter role than competing aircraft such as the Spitfire Mk IX). The powerful engine allowed the aircraft to carry a load of up to two {{convert|1,000|lb|kg}} bombs, equal to the [[light bomber]]s of only a few years earlier. The bomb-equipped aircraft were nicknamed \"Bombphoons\" and entered service with No. 181 Squadron, formed in September 1942.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 9.</ref>{{refn|The Typhoon's original bomb load of 500 lbs was doubled and then doubled again.<ref>Gunston 1980, p. 102.</ref>|group=nb}}\n\nFrom September 1943, Typhoons were also armed with four \"60 lb\" [[RP-3]] rockets under each wing.{{refn|A {{convert|6|in|mm|adj=mid|-diameter}}, {{convert|60|lb|kg}} [[high explosive]] warhead was the main version used on Typhoons. Also used was solid {{convert|25|lb|kg|abbr=on|adj=on}}, 3.44-inch [[armour piercing]] warhead as well as a {{convert|25|lb|kg|abbr=on|adj=on}} mild steel (later concrete) practice head.|group=nb}} In October 1943, No. 181 Squadron made the first Typhoon rocket attacks. Although the rocket projectiles were inaccurate and took considerable skill to aim and allow for [[External ballistics|ballistic drop]] after firing, \"the sheer firepower of just one Typhoon was equivalent to a destroyer's broadside.\"{{cn|date=November 2019}} By the end of 1943, eighteen rocket-equipped Typhoon squadrons formed the basis of the RAF [[Second Tactical Air Force]] (2nd TAF) ground attack arm in Europe. In theory, the rocket rails and bomb-racks were interchangeable; in practice, to simplify supply, some 2nd TAF Typhoon squadrons (such as 198 Squadron) used the rockets only, while other squadrons were armed exclusively with bombs (this also allowed individual units to more finely hone their skills with their assigned weapons).<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 16.</ref>\n\nBy the [[Normandy landings]] in June 1944, 2 TAF had eighteen operational squadrons of Typhoon IBs, while [[RAF Fighter Command]] had a further nine.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 58.</ref> The aircraft proved itself to be the most effective RAF tactical strike aircraft, on interdiction raids against communications and transport targets deep in North Western Europe prior to the invasion and in direct support of the Allied ground forces after D-Day. A system of close liaison with the ground troops was set up by the RAF and army: RAF radio operators in vehicles equipped with [[Very high frequency|VHF]] [[Transmitter|R/T]] travelled with the troops close to the front line and called up Typhoons operating in a \"[[Taxicab stand|Cab Rank]]\", which attacked the targets, marked for them by smoke shells fired by mortar or artillery, until they were destroyed.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 64.</ref>\n\n[[File:Typhoon IBs 198 Sqn RAF at Plumetot July 1944.jpg|thumb|left|[[No. 198 Squadron RAF|198 Sqn.]] Typhoons on airfield [[Advanced Landing Ground|B10/Plumetot]], France, in July 1944.

Patton|Patton]]'s break-out from the beachhead; this counter-attack was repulsed by 2nd Tactical Air Force Typhoons and the 9th USAAF. During the course of the battle, pilots of the 2nd Tactical Air Force and 9th USAAF claimed to have destroyed a combined total of 252 tanks.<ref>Zetterling 2000, p. 38.</ref> Only 177 German tanks and assault guns participated in the battle and only 46 were lost \u2013 of which nine were verified as destroyed by Typhoons, four percent of the total claimed.<ref>Zetterling 2000, pp. 38, 52.</ref>\n\nHowever, after-action studies at the time were based on random sampling of wrecks rather than exhaustive surveys, <ref>http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&metadataPrefix=html&identifier=ADA951850</ref> and the degree of overclaim attributed to Typhoon pilots as a result was statistically improbable in view of the far lower known level of overclaim by Allied pilots in air-to-air combat, where claims were if anything more likely to be mistaken. Allied and German witness accounts of Typhoon attacks on German armour indicate that RPs did kill tanks with fair probability. Horst Weber, an SS panzergrenadier serving with Kampfgruppe Knaust south of Arnhem in the later stages of Operation Market Garden, recalled that, during a battle with British 43rd Wessex Division on 23 September 1944, 'We had four Tiger tanks and three Panther tanks... We were convinced that we would gain another victory here, that we would smash the enemy forces. But then Typhoons dropped these rockets on our tanks and shot all seven to bits. And we cried... We would see two black dots in the sky and that always meant rockets. Then the rockets would hit the tanks which would burn. The soldiers would come out all burnt and screaming with pain.' <ref>Beevor 2019, p.302</ref>  \n\nThe effect on the morale of German troops caught up in a Typhoon RP and cannon attack was decisive, with many tanks and vehicles being abandoned, in spite of superficial damage, such that, at Mortain, a signal from the German Army's Chief of Staff stated that the attack had been brought to a standstill by 13:00 '...due to the employment of fighter-bombers by the enemy, and the absence of our own air-support.'<ref>Thomas 2010, pp. 68\u201369.</ref> The 20&nbsp;mm cannon also destroyed a large number of (unarmoured) support vehicles, laden with fuel and ammunition for the armoured vehicles.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 68.</ref> On 10 July at Mortain, flying in support of the US 30th Infantry Division, Typhoons flew 294 sorties in the afternoon that day, firing 2,088 rockets and dropping {{convert|80|ST|MT}} of bombs.<ref>Hallion, Richard P. \"The U.S. Army Air Forces in World War II.\" ''Air Power Over the Normandy Beaches and Beyond'' (Air Force History and Museums Program), 1994.</ref> They engaged the German formations while the US 9th Air Force prevented German fighters from intervening. [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the Supreme Allied Commander, said of the Typhoons; \"The chief credit in smashing the enemy's spearhead, however, must go to the rocket-firing Typhoon aircraft of the Second Tactical Air Force... The result of the strafing was that the enemy attack was effectively brought to a halt, and a threat was turned into a great victory.\"<ref>Grey and Cox 2002, p. 105.</ref>\n\nAnother form of attack carried out by Typhoons was \"Cloak and Dagger\" operations, using intelligence sources to target German HQs. One of the most effective of these was carried out on 24 October 1944, when 146 Typhoon Wing attacked a building in [[Dordrecht]], where senior members of the German 15th Army staff were meeting; 17 [[staff officer]]s and 36 other officers were killed and the operations of the 15th Army were adversely affected for some time afterwards.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 74.</ref>\n\n[[File:3 in RP 60 pdr Loading On Typhoon.jpg|thumb|Armourers loading RP-3 rockets with 60 lb High Explosive heads onto steel Mk.

On 3 May 1945, the ''[[Cap Arcona]]'', the ''[[SS Thielbek (1940)|Thielbek]]'' and the ''[[Deutschland IV|Deutschland]]'', large passenger ships in peacetime now in military service, were sunk in four attacks by RAF Hawker Typhoon 1Bs of [[No. 83 Expeditionary Air Group (United Kingdom)|No. 83 Group RAF]], [[2nd Tactical Air Force]]: the first by [[No. 184 Squadron RAF|184 Squadron]], second by [[No. 198 Squadron RAF|198 Squadron]] led by [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[John Robert Baldwin]], the third by [[No. 263 Squadron RAF|263 Squadron]] led by [[Squadron Leader]] Martin T.

Baldwin (609 Squadron and Commanding Officer 198 Squadron, 146 (Typhoon) Wing and 123 (Typhoon) Wing), who claimed 15 aircraft shot down from 1942 to 1944. Some 246 Axis aircraft were claimed by Typhoon pilots during the war.<ref>Thomas 1999</ref>\n\n3,317 Typhoons were built, almost all by [[Gloster Aircraft Company|Gloster]]. Hawker developed what was originally an improved '''Typhoon II''', but the differences between it and the Mk I were so great that it was effectively a different aircraft, and was renamed the [[Hawker Tempest]]. Once the war in Europe was over Typhoons were quickly removed from front-line squadrons; by October 1945 the Typhoon was no longer in operational use, with many of the wartime Typhoon units such as 198 Squadron being either disbanded or renumbered.<ref>Thomas 2000, p. 24.</ref><ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 181.</ref>\n\n===Captured Typhoons===\nBy 1943, with its change of role to ground attack, the Typhoon was constantly operating over enemy territory: inevitably some flyable examples fell into German hands. The first Typhoon to be flown by the ''Luftwaffe'' was ''EJ956'' '''SA-I''' of 486 (NZ) Sqn. On 23 March 1943, two aircraft flown by [[Flying officer|F/O]] Smith and [[Flight sergeant|F/S]] Mawson were on a \"Rhubarb\" over France.{{refn|A \"Rhubarb\" was a small scale attack on enemy ground targets of opportunity. Usually, these were undertaken by a section of two aircraft. Ideally, there would be a heavy cloud base at {{convert|2,000|\u2013|3,000|ft|m|abbr=on}}; should fighter opposition be too heavy it would be possible to pull up into the cloud.|group=nb}}  Just as they were crossing the coast at low altitude, Mawson's Typhoon was hit by light ''flak''. He managed to belly-land in a field near Cany-Barville but the aircraft was captured before he could destroy it. The Typhoon was repaired and test flown at [[Rechlin]] (a German equivalent to [[RAE Farnborough]]), and later served as T9+GK with \"[[Zirkus Rosarius]]\". EJ956 overturned and was written off during a forced landing near Meckelfeld, on 10 August 1944.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988\">Thomas and Shores 1988</ref><ref name=\"Sortehaug\"/> On 14 February 1944, another Typhoon was captured and later flown in Zirkus Rosarius. JP548 of [[No. 174 Squadron RAF|174 Squadron]] force landed after engine failure near Blois, France; the pilot, F/O Proddow evaded capture. This Typhoon crashed at Reinsehlen on 29 July 1944, killing Feldwebel Gold.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988\"/>\n\n==Modifications 1941\u20131945==\n[[File:Typhoonnew.jpg|right|thumb|A Charles E.

The photo gives a clear view of the \"car-door\" cockpit entry; the rear view mirror under a perspex blister can be seen on the hinged canopy roof.]]\nAs was usual with many front line Second World War RAF aircraft, the Typhoon was modified and updated regularly, so that a 1945 production example looked quite different from one built in 1941. In the last months of the war, a number of older aircraft were taken out of storage and overhauled, sometimes seeing active service for the first time; for example, R7771 was from one of the first production batches, built in 1942 with the car-door canopy and other early production features. This Typhoon was delivered to, and served on the [[Fighter Interception Unit]] in 1942.<ref>Mason 1991, p. 558.</ref> In February 1945 ''R7771'' was listed as being in front line service on [[No. 182 Squadron RAF|182 Sqn.]]; by then it was fitted with a clear-view \"bubble\" hood, rocket rails and other late series features.{{refn|''R7771'' is listed as being shot down by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|flak]] on 28 February 1945. [[Warrant Officer|W/O]] F. W. Cuthbertson was killed.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 209.</ref>|group=nb}}\n\n===Carbon monoxide seepage===\nThe first problem encountered with the Typhoon after its entry into service was the seepage of [[carbon monoxide]] fumes into the cockpit. In an attempt to alleviate this, longer exhaust stubs were fitted in November 1941 (\"Mod [modification] 239\"), and at about the same time the port (left) cockpit doors were sealed. The Pilot's Notes for the Typhoon recommended that \"Unless Mod. No. 239 has been embodied it is most important that oxygen be used ''at all times'' as a precaution against [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].\"<ref>''Air Ministry'' 1943, p. 13.</ref> Despite the modifications, the problem was never entirely solved, and the standard procedure throughout the war was for Typhoon pilots to use oxygen from engine start-up to engine shut down.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 30.</ref> In addition to carbon monoxide seepage, pilots were experiencing unpleasantly high cockpit temperatures; eventually a ventilation tube helped alleviate, but did not solve the problem. In addition two small, rear opening vents were added below the port side radio hatch, just below the canopy.{{refn| In April 1943, [[Flight Lieutenant|F/L]] A. O. Moffet of the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE Farnborough]] was attached to 486(NZ) Sqn in response to complaints about the overheated cockpits of the Typhoons. For a fortnight, \"Moff\" flew operationally with the unit. His tests showed that the cockpit temperatures could reach {{convert|135|F|C}}.<ref name =\"Wheeler 1963\">Wheeler 1963, pp. 80\u201386.</ref>|group=nb}}<ref name = \"Sortehaug\">Sortehaug 1998</ref>\n\n===Tail===\nA major problem, afflicting early production Typhoons in particular, was a series of structural failures leading to loss of the entire tail sections of some aircraft, mainly during high-speed dives. Eventually a combination of factors was identified, including harmonic vibration, which could quickly lead to metal fatigue, and a weak transport joint just forward of the horizontal tail unit. The loss of the tailplane of R7692 (having only 11 hours of flight recorded) on 11 August 1942, in the hands of an experienced test pilot (Seth-Smith), caused a major reassessment which concluded that the failure of the bracket holding the elevator mass balance [[Bellcrank|bell crank]] linkage had allowed unrestrained flutter which led to structural failure of the fuselage at the transport joint.\n\nStarting in September 1942, a steel strap was fitted internally across the rear fuselage transport joint, although this was soon superseded by Mod 286 (modification number 286), in which 20 alloy \"fishplates\" were riveted externally across the rear fuselage transport joint, while internally some of the rear fuselage frames were strengthened. This was a permanent measure designed to stop rear fuselage structural failures and was introduced on the production line from the 820th aircraft; between December 1942 and March 1943, all Typhoons without Mod 286 were taken out of service and modified. Modified balance weight assemblies were fitted from May 1943. Finally the entire unit was replaced with a redesigned assembly from August 1944.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 20.\">Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 20.</ref>\n\nAlthough these modifications reduced the numbers of Typhoons being lost due to tail assembly failure, towards the end of the Typhoon's life there were more tail failures, this time caused by a change to the undercarriage latch mechanism in late 1944; in high-speed flight the undercarriage fairings were pulled into the slipstream, creating an uneven airflow over the elevators and rudder resulting in tailplane and then rear fuselage structural failure.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 20.\"/> In total 25 aircraft were lost and 23 pilots killed due to tail failures.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 20.\"/>\n\n===Canopy===\n[[File:Hawker Typhoon 4 ExCC.jpg|thumb|Late model Typhoon of [[No. 440 Squadron RCAF|440 (RCAF) Squadron]]. Note the bomb rack under the wing. Rows of five gallon [[jerrycan]]s dominate the foreground]]\nThe Typhoon was first produced with forward-opening \"car door\" style<ref group=nb>Another aircraft with this sort of door was the [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]]</ref> cockpit doors (complete with wind-down windows), with a transparent \"roof\" hinged to open to the left. The first 162 Typhoons featured a built-up metal-skinned dorsal fairing behind the pilot's armoured headrest; the mast for the radio aerial protruded through the fairing.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 16, 29.</ref> From mid- to late 1941 the solid metal aft dorsal fairing was replaced with a transparent structure (later nicknamed \"The Coffin Hood\"),<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 20.\"/> the pilot's head armour plate was modified to a triangular shape and the side cut-outs were fitted with armoured glass; the first production Typhoon to be fitted with this new structure was ''R7803''. All earlier aircraft were quickly withdrawn and modified. From early 1942 a rear-view mirror was mounted in a perspex blister moulded into the later \"car-door\" canopy roofs. This modification was not very successful, because the mirror was subject to vibration.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 21.\">Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 21.</ref> Despite the new canopy structure, the pilot's visibility was still restricted by the heavy frames and the clutter of equipment under the rear canopy; from August 1943, as an interim measure, pending the introduction of the new [[Bubble canopy|\"bubble\" canopy]] and cut-down dorsal fairing, the aerial mast and its associated bracing was removed and replaced with a whip aerial further back on the rear fuselage.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 10.</ref>\n\nStarting in January 1943, ''R8809'' was used to test a new, clear, one piece sliding \"bubble\" canopy and its associated new windscreen structure which had slimmer frames which, together with the \"cut-down\" rear dorsal fairing, provided a far superior all-around field of view to the car-door type. From November 1943 all production aircraft, starting with ''JR333'', were to be so fitted.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 21.\"/><ref name=\"Bentley 1975, p. 542.\"/> However, the complex modifications required to the fuselage and a long lead time for new components to reach the production line meant that it took some time before the new canopy became standard. To have as many Typhoons of 2nd TAF fitted before \"[[Operation Overlord]]\" conversion kits were produced and Gloster, Hawker and Cunliffe-Owen modified older Typhoons still fitted with the car-door canopy.<ref>Thomas 2009, pp. 10\u201311.</ref> {{refn|It is believed that the first modified Typhoon was ''R8843'' ''DJ-S'', flown by New Zealander [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Desmond J. Scott]], C/O of the [[Tangmere]] Wing from September 1943.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 52.</ref>|group=nb}}\n\n===Long-range fighter and fighter-bomber===\n[[File:Hawker Typhoon 3 ExCC.jpg|thumb|right|An early production Typhoon with 45 gallon drop tanks and unfaired cannon; the shallow gull shape of the wing can be seen in this view.]]\nFrom early 1943 the wings were plumbed and adapted to carry cylindrical {{convert|45|impgal|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[drop tank]]s,{{refn|These same drop tanks used by the Hurricane from 1940.|group=nb}} increasing the Typhoon's range from {{convert|690|mi}} to up to {{convert|1,090|mi}}. This enabled Typhoons to range deep into France, the Netherlands and Belgium. Some units, such as 609 Squadron and [[No. 198 Squadron RAF|198 Squadron]], were able to achieve notable success in air combat and ground attack operations using these long-range Typhoons.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 25.\">Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 25.</ref>\n\nAs production continued, the Typhoon's role changed from a low-level interceptor fighter to a fighter bomber. Racks capable of carrying {{convert|500|lb|adj=on}} bombs were fitted to the wings from October 1942 and were first used operationally by [[No. 181 Squadron RAF|181 Squadron]]. By mid-1943, all Typhoons off the production line were capable of carrying bombs. Bigger, solid rubber, grooved \"anti-shimmy\" tail wheel tyres were introduced in March 1943 on all Typhoons from the 1,001st production aircraft, ''EK238''. The new tyres helped to make heavier, bomb-laden Typhoons more manageable during ground manoeuvres. With the introduction of the bomb racks, small extensions were added to the cannon shell case ejector slots. These allowed the casings to drop clear of bombs or drop tanks suspended from the wing racks.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 23\">Thomas and Shores 1988, p. 23.</ref> Because of the vulnerability of the Typhoon's [[Water cooling|liquid-cooled engine]] cooling system to ground fire, some {{convert|780|lb}} of armour was added, lining the sides and bottom of the cockpit and engine compartments, as well as the [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] bath.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 11.</ref>\n\nWith the added weight of the bombs and armour, bigger [[disc brake|brake discs]] were fitted to the main wheels. At first this only applied to \"Bombphoons\", but eventually all Typhoons used these brakes. After tests conducted in 1943, it was determined that the Typhoon was capable of carrying a {{convert|1000|lb|adj=on}} bomb under each wing. With the increased load, it was decided that the extra take-off performance conferred by a four-bladed propeller was an advantage. This led to the adoption of a four-bladed propeller unit (de Havilland or [[Rotol]]) from early 1944. Coinciding with the new propeller, it was also decided that the larger tailplanes of the [[Hawker Tempest]] were to be fitted when tests showed that they improved the handling characteristics of the Typhoon when carrying {{convert|1000|lb|adj=on}} bombs.<ref name=\"Bentley 1975, p. 542.\">Bentley 1975, p. 542.</ref><ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 23, 24.</ref> Problems were experienced with oil seal leaks from the new propeller unit and a growing number of Typhoons were held in Maintenance Units (MUs) awaiting the arrival of new seals from the U.S. Some 200 Typhoons were manufactured with the new Tempest tails and the three-bladed propeller. A modification programme was inaugurated but it took several months before a majority of operational Typhoons had the four-bladed propeller and enlarged tailplane.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 15.</ref>{{refn|Early in its service life, the Typhoon airframe was prone to a high-frequency vibration while in flight, such that pilots reported that touching the cockpit walls was akin to receiving a mild electric shock.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 21, 23.</ref> Although not dangerous, it was uncomfortable, and a specially sprung seat was designed and fitted. With the introduction of the four-bladed propeller and larger tailplane it was found that not only was the performance and handling of the Typhoon enhanced, the vibration was much reduced.<ref name=\"Thos0912\">Thomas 2010, p. 12.</ref>|group=nb}}\n\nIn June 1943, Hawker fitted a Typhoon with four steel \"Mark I\" rocket rails under each wing. Trials at the [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment]] (A & AEE) and [[Air Fighting Development Unit]] (AFDU) showed that the combination of the [[RP-3]] rocket and the stable, high-speed platform of the Typhoon was promising. Carrying the eight rails and rockets, it was found that the top speed was reduced by {{convert|38|mph|abbr=on}}, with no adverse handling effects. As a result, the Mk I rails and RP-3s were first fitted to production aircraft of [[No. 181 Squadron RAF|181 Squadron]] in October 1943.<ref>Thomas 2010, pp. 13, 46.</ref> At first attempts were made to arm Typhoons with either bombs or rockets depending on requirements but it was soon decided that squadrons would specialise. By [[D-Day]], the 2nd TAF was able to field 11 RP (\"Rockphoon\") Typhoon squadrons and seven \"Bombphoon\" squadrons.<ref>Thomas 2010, pp. 16, 58, 88\u201390.</ref>\n\nLater in 1944, attempts were made to increase the firepower by \"double banking\" rockets on each rail, enabling the Typhoon to carry 16 rockets. The problems involved in operating Typhoons from 2nd TAF airstrips meant that this was not much used, although some Typhoons did fly operationally with 12 rockets, using double-banked rockets on the inner rails.<ref>Thomas 2000, p. 25.</ref> When extra range was required, Typhoons could also operate carrying a drop tank and two rockets outboard of the tank under each wing. From December 1944, aluminium \"Mark III\" rails, which weighed {{convert|240|lb}} per set, replaced the steel Mk Is, which weighed {{convert|480|lb}}.<ref name=\"Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 25-26.\">Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 25\u201326.</ref>{{refn|Starting in June 1944, new production Typhoons had the landing light in the leading edge of the port wing, although most units of 2 TAF omitted this feature and faired over the opening with a metal panel, giving the appearance that all production Typhoons were manufactured without the lights.<ref>Thomas 2010, p. 20.</ref>|group=nb}}\n\nIn late 1943, Mk III IFF replaced the Mk I and the tailplane tip to fuselage [[Identification friend or foe]] (IFF) aerials were replaced by a \"[[bayonet]]\" aerial under the wing's centre section. A [[Beam Approach Beacon System]] (''Rebecca'') transponder unit was fitted in 1944, with the associated aerial appearing under the centre section.\n\nOnce Typhoons started operating from forward landing grounds in Normandy, it was found that the dust clouds stirred up by propeller wash consisted of over 80 percent of hard, abrasive material which was damaging the Sabre engines. The [[sleeve valve]]s in particular were subject to excessive wear and it was calculated that engines would last for three take-offs. As a result, a \"dome deflector\" was designed and manufactured at great speed by Napier, and within a week most Typhoons had been fitted with it. In operational service these mushroom-shaped [[air filter]]s, which became red hot, had a propensity for being blown off the air intake at high speed whenever a Sabre engine backfired. They were soon replaced by drum-shaped filters designed by the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment|RAE]] and Vokes. These had \"[[cuckoo clock]]\" doors in front, which swung open with the pressure changes caused by engine backfires. This standardised filter became Typhoon Mod.420.<ref name=\"Shores and Thomas 2008, p.602.\">Shores and Thomas 2008, p. 602.</ref>\n\nAt the end of June 1944, a decision was taken to fit tropical air filters as standard, similar to those fitted to the three Typhoons which had been sent to North Africa in 1943. One thousand sets of the filters were to be manufactured and fitted to front line Typhoons as Mod. 421. It was estimated that these could be fitted to all Typhoons on the production lines by the end of September. Research shows that late Typhoons starting in the ''RB---'' series were fitted with the filters, as were some rebuilt aircraft from earlier production batches. Mod. 421 appeared as a streamlined rectangular \"hump\", just behind the main radiator fairing and between the inner wheel doors, where the [[carburetor|updraught carburettor]] intake was located.<ref name=\"Shores and Thomas 2008, p.602.\"/>\n\nA small, elongated oval [[Pitot-static system|static port]] appeared on the rear starboard fuselage in late 1944. This was apparently used to more accurately measure the aircraft's altitude.\n\n[[File:Hawker Typhoon ExCC.jpg|thumb|A late production Typhoon with full RP-3 armament, on the later aluminium Mk III rails, using a mix of SAP/HE 60 lb warheads (outermost rail and third) and the HE fragmentation head introduced in early December 1944 (2nd and 4th rail); there are no landing lights on the leading edges of the wings.<ref>Thomas 2010, pp. 13\u201314.</ref>]]\n\nOne Typhoon, ''R8694'', was used by [[D. Napier & Son|Napier]] for trials with the more powerful Sabre IV, cooled using an annular radiator and driving a four-bladed propeller. The new engine and radiator arrangement required substantial modifications to the forward fuselage and engine bearer structures. Although a maximum speed of {{convert|452|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} was claimed by Napier, it was decided that the modifications would not be worthwhile, mainly because of the promising development of the Tempest, and because the disruption to Typhoon production would not be sufficiently outweighed by any benefit achieved.<ref>Thomas and Shores 1988, pp. 20\u201321.</ref><ref>[http://www.napierheritage.org.uk/spip.php?article100438 \"Napier Power Heritage.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212123126/http://www.napierheritage.org.uk/spip.php?article100438 |date=12 February 2009 }} ''napierheritage.org.''

(''[[Airborne interception radar|Airborne Interception]]'', i.e., [[radar]]) equipment, a special night-flying cockpit and other modifications.\nAlso in 1943, five Typhoons<ref group=\"nb\">''R8889'', ''R8891'', ''R8925'', ''DN323'' and ''EJ906''</ref> were modified to \"Tropical\" standard by fitting of an air filter in a fairing behind the main radiator housing.

In this version the port inner cannon was removed and three (one forward-facing {{convert|14|in|mm|adj=on}} and two vertical five-inch) [[F24 camera]]s were carried in its place.{{refn|Pilots soon discovered that the aircraft yawed to the left when the cannon were fired because the recoil of the two cannon on the starboard wing was not properly balanced by the single cannon to port; as a result the starboard inner cannon was also removed from some aircraft.|group=nb}} Few FR IBs were built, and most served with [[No. 268 Squadron RAF|268 Squadron]], starting in July 1944. The aircraft was never popular with the pilots, who preferred the older [[North American P-51 Mustang|Mustang Is and IAs]], and the inherent engine and airframe vibrations meant that photos were invariably blurred. As a consequence of these problems, the FR IB was phased out in January 1945.\n\nIn 1941, Hawker tendered the Hawker P.1009 \"Fleet Fighter\" in response to [[List of Air Ministry Specifications#1930-1939|specification '''N.11/40''']] for a carrier-based fighter. A new centre section was to be fitted, extending the wingspan to over {{convert|45|ft|m|abbr=on}}, and thus increasing the wing area; the wings themselves were to be [[Folding wing|folding units]], which swung and folded parallel to the fuselage, with the leading edges pointing upwards, much like the folding wings on the [[Grumman F6F Hellcat]]. The rear fuselage was to be longer and a v-style [[Tailhook|arrestor hook]] and associated [[Aircraft catapult|catapult-launching]] gear was to be fitted. The design chosen was to result in the postwar [[Blackburn Firebrand]] design.<ref>Mason 1991, p. 642.</ref>\n\n==Flight characteristics==\n[[File:A Hawker Typhoon Mk IB of No. 486 Squadron RAF, 27 October 1943. CH11578.jpg|thumbnail|right|A Hawker Typhoon Mk IB of No. 486 Squadron RAF in flight, in 1943]]\nFlight Lieutenant Ken Trott flew Typhoons with 197 Squadron and recalled:\n\n{{quote|Rather a large aircraft shall we say, for a single-engine fighter. Terrific power. Quite something to control. I liked it from the point of view of speed and being a very stable gun platform. You could come in on a target at 400 mph and the thing was as steady as a rock.<ref name= \"Darlow p. 49.\">Darlow 2005, p. 49.</ref>}}\n\nIn early March 1943, at [[RAF Tangmere|Tangmere]], the then new Squadron Leader of 486 (NZ) Squadron, Des Scott, flew a Typhoon for the first time:\n\n{{quote|She roared, screamed, groaned and whined, but apart from being rather heavy on the controls at high speeds she came through her tests with flying colours...Applying a few degrees of flap we swung on down into the airfield approach, levelled out above the runway and softly eased down on to her two wheels, leaving her tail up until she dropped it of her own accord.\n\nWe were soon back in her bay by the dispersal hut, where I turned off the petrol supply cock. After a few moments she ran herself out and with a spit, sob and weary sigh, her great three-bladed propeller came to a stop. So that was it: I was drenched in perspiration and tired out...<ref name =\"Scott 1983.\">Scott 1983, pp. 15\u201317.</ref>}}\n\nThe performance limitations for speed were noted on the pilot's notes, published by the Air Ministry. [[Indicated airspeed]] for diving was set at {{convert|525|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The Typhoon could, if needed, be flown at {{convert|300|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} with the cockpit \"hood\" open. Flight with undercarriage and flaps down could be made without incident, at the respective speeds of {{convert|210|and|155|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Owing to stability problems, when the aircraft was carrying bombs, the speed could not exceed 400&nbsp;mph.<ref>Air Ministry 1945, p. 26 (I A and I B notes).</ref>\n\nNotes for the management of the fuel system stated that indicated airspeeds (IAS) in excess of {{convert|380|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} were not advisable when fitted with auxiliary drop tanks. Tanks were jettisoned at about {{convert|200|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, but in an emergency, a release at {{convert|350|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} was permitted. Tanks were to be ejected in straight and level flight only.<ref>Air Ministry 1945, p. 12 (I A and I B notes).</ref> General flying ability was positive. The maximum climbing rate was {{convert|185|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} up to {{convert|16000|ft|m|abbr=on}} reducing speed by {{convert|3|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} per {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} above this mark. In stability terms, the aircraft was stable \"directionally\" and \"laterally\" but slightly unstable longitudinally, except at high speed, when it was just stable. [[Aileron]] control was light and effective up to maximum speed, but at very low speed response was sluggish, particularly when carrying ordnance. The elevator control was rather light and should not be used harshly. There was a tendency to \"tighten up\" in a looping aircraft. If \"black out\" conditions were accidentally induced in steep turns or aerobatics, the control column was to be pushed forward \"firmly\".<ref>''Air Ministry'' 1945, p. 18 (I A and I B notes).</ref>\n\nStalling speeds were quite low. The typical Typhoon trait, as with most aircraft at the time, was to drop a wing sharply with flaps either up or down. The stalling speeds varied. The various loads depended on external fittings. All-up weight plus two {{convert|500|lb|abbr=on}} bombs (12,155&nbsp;lb in total) with flaps up could induce a stall at 90\u2013100&nbsp;mph. With flaps down, stall was initiated at 70\u201375&nbsp;mph. Normal all-up weight (11,120&nbsp;lb) would see stall at 80\u201390 and 65\u201370&nbsp;mph respectively. With all ammunition and nearly all fuel expended (9,600&nbsp;lb) stall occurred at 75\u201380 and 65\u201370&nbsp;mph.<ref>''Air Ministry'' 1945, p. 19 (I A and I B notes).</ref>\n\n==Operators==\n{{Main|List of Hawker Typhoon operators}}\n\n*{{Flag icon|AUS}} [[Australia]]\n*{{Flag icon|Canada|1921}} [[Canada]]\n*{{Flag icon|NZL}} [[New Zealand]]\n*{{Flag icon|UK}} [[United Kingdom]]\n\n==Surviving aircraft==\n[[File:Hawker Typhoon at RAF Museum.jpg|thumb|right|Hawker Typhoon ''MN235'' RAF Museum]]\n\nOnly one complete Hawker Typhoon still survives \u2013 [[United Kingdom military aircraft serials|serial number]] ''MN235''.
