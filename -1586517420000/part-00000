By the end of March 1975, the study revealed a plan to build three inline runways, three international terminal buildings, three domestic buildings and one building for [[Hajj]] flights. Three stores for the domestic terminals would be built between 1975 and 1981 at a cost of [[US$]]465 million and one domestic terminal including an apron from 1982\u20131985 at a cost of US$126 million.

Terminal 1 is in the southern side of the airport, while Terminal 2 and 3 are on the north side.\n\nThe airport concept is described as \"garden within the airport\" or \"airport in the garden\", as tropical decorative and flower plants fill the spaces between corridors, waiting and boarding pavilions. The boarding pavilions demonstrate local [[Indonesian architecture|Indonesian vernacular architecture]], particularly the roof, in the [[Java]]nese stepped-roof ''[[pendopo]]'' and ''[[joglo]]'' style. The interior design displays the diversity of Indonesian art and culture, with ethnic decorative elements taken from wooden carvings of Java, Bali, Sumatra, Dayak, [[Toraja]] to Papua. Another example is the railings of stairs, doors and gates, which show the [[kala (time)|kala]]-[[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] (giant head and mythical fish-elephant creature) theme typical in [[Candi of Indonesia#Kala-Makara|ancient Indonesian temples]] such as [[Borobudur]].

The team, however chose the latter, similar to [[Orly Airport]], [[Lyon Satolas Airport|Lyon Satolas]], [[Hannover Airport]] and [[Kansas City International Airport|Kansas City Airport]] due to its simplicity and effectiveness.\n\nOn 12 November 1976, the building project tender was won by the French Aeroport de Paris. 6 months later, the final design was agreed on by the Indonesian government and Aeroport de Paris with a fixed cost of about 22,323,203 French francs and Rp. 177,156,000 equivalent to 2,100,000 francs. The work was scheduled to take 18 months. The government appointed PT. Konavi as the local partner. The plan included 2 runways with taxiways, one access road in the east and one in the west (closed to public use) for airport services, 3 terminals capable of accommodating 3 million passengers per year, and 1 module for international flights and 2 for domestic. \"An airport inside a garden\" was chosen as the design idea.\n\nOn 20 May 1980, a four-year contract was signed.

In 1969, a senior communication officers meeting in [[Bangkok]] expressed these concerns.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} [[File:Jakarta Airport Dept area.jpg|thumb|Departure area at Terminal 2]]\n\nIn the early 1970s, with the help of [[USAID]], eight potential locations were analyzed for a new international airport, namely [[Kemayoran]], Malaka, [[Babakan]], [[Jonggol]], [[Halim Perdanakusuma Airport|Halim]], [[Curug, Tangerang|Curug]], [[South Tangerang]] and North Tangerang.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} Finally, the North Tangerang site was chosen; it was also noted that Jonggol could be used as an alternative airfield. Meanwhile, as an interim step, the Indonesian government upgraded the Halim Perdanakusuma airfield for use for passenger services. The old Kemayoran site was closed in 1985, and the land was later used for commercial and housing purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/eng/news/2012/08/kemayoran-tower|title=Kemayoran Tower \u2013 News|publisher=Department of Communication, Informatics and Public Relations of Jakarta Capital City|date=28 August 2012|accessdate=4 June 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220043406/http://www.jakarta.go.id/eng/news/2012/08/kemayoran-tower|archivedate=20 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1974 and 1975, a [[Canada|Canadian]] consortium, consisting of Aviation Planning Services Ltd., ACRESS International Ltd., and Searle Wilbee Rowland (SWR), won a bid for the new airport feasibility project. The feasibility study started on 20 February 1974, with a total cost of 1 million [[Canadian dollars]]. The one-year project proceeded with an Indonesian partner represented by PT Konavi. By the end of March 1975, the study revealed a plan to build three inline runways, three international terminal buildings, three domestic buildings and one building for [[Hajj]] flights. Three stores for the domestic terminals would be built between 1975 and 1981 at a cost of [[US$]]465 million and one domestic terminal including an apron from 1982\u20131985 at a cost of US$126 million.

The airport terminal took the plan of spanning fan, with the main entrances of terminals connected to a series of waiting and boarding pavilions via corridors. These waiting and boarding pavilions are connected to the airplanes through [[jet bridge|boarding bridges]]. Terminal 1 is in the southern side of the airport, while Terminal 2 and 3 are on the north side.\n\nThe airport concept is described as \"garden within the airport\" or \"airport in the garden\", as tropical decorative and flower plants fill the spaces between corridors, waiting and boarding pavilions. The boarding pavilions demonstrate local [[Indonesian architecture|Indonesian vernacular architecture]], particularly the roof, in the [[Java]]nese stepped-roof ''[[pendopo]]'' and ''[[joglo]]'' style. The interior design displays the diversity of Indonesian art and culture, with ethnic decorative elements taken from wooden carvings of Java, Bali, Sumatra, Dayak, [[Toraja]] to Papua. Another example is the railings of stairs, doors and gates, which show the [[kala (time)|kala]]-[[Makara (Hindu mythology)|makara]] (giant head and mythical fish-elephant creature) theme typical in [[Candi of Indonesia#Kala-Makara|ancient Indonesian temples]] such as [[Borobudur]].

The cost rose because of using a decentralized system. The centralized system was seen as a more suitable option. The team, however chose the latter, similar to [[Orly Airport]], [[Lyon Satolas Airport|Lyon Satolas]], [[Hannover Airport]] and [[Kansas City International Airport|Kansas City Airport]] due to its simplicity and effectiveness.\n\nOn 12 November 1976, the building project tender was won by the French Aeroport de Paris. 6 months later, the final design was agreed on by the Indonesian government and Aeroport de Paris with a fixed cost of about 22,323,203 French francs and Rp. 177,156,000 equivalent to 2,100,000 francs. The work was scheduled to take 18 months. The government appointed PT. Konavi as the local partner. The plan included 2 runways with taxiways, one access road in the east and one in the west (closed to public use) for airport services, 3 terminals capable of accommodating 3 million passengers per year, and 1 module for international flights and 2 for domestic. \"An airport inside a garden\" was chosen as the design idea.\n\nOn 20 May 1980, a four-year contract was signed. Sainraptet Brice, SAE, Colas together with PT. Waskita Karya were chosen to be the developers. Ir.

The government of [[Abdullah Badawi]] also attempted to link terrorism with the HINDRAF rally via the media.<ref>[http://www.straitstimes.com/Latest%2BNews/Asia/STIStory_181660.html US defends peaceful protests in Malaysia] ''The Straits Times''</ref>\n\nAs of 11 December 2007, HINDRAF leaders were all acquitted by the judicial courts due to a lack of evidence and a flimsy prosecution case against their allegations. To contain the movement while not being able to charge them according to valid evidence-based legal processes, on 12 December 2007 Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi personally signed the detention letters to imprison the HINDRAF leaders under the Internal Security Act (ISA) for two years. Their detention terms are subject to infinite renewal. The reason given for this arrest was that the HINDRAF leadership has had links with international terrorist organisations such as [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE){{citation needed|date=March 2020}} and also supposedly militant organisations like [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS){{citation needed|date=March 2020}} in India. The invocation of the ISA to capture the HINDRAF leaders was seen as a strategic move by the [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO) government to arrest the momentum generated by HINDRAF.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\nThe UMNO-led Government has threatened the Malaysian Indian community{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} with sweeping arrests under the Emergency Act and ISA (similar to Operasi Lalang of the 1987, which targeted anti-BN elements in Malaysia, mostly of Malaysian Chinese extraction).{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} This hard-line approach is also softened by the MIC reconciliatory approach to blunt HINDRAF's thrust as the champion of the Malaysian Indian community.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Response to the detentions==\nEven as Prime Minister [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]] started threatening to use the ISA against the HINDRAF leaders for bringing Malaysia's racist policies out into the open for all to see, foreign news outlets criticised Badawi's lack of initiative to tackle the root cause of the problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=904&Itemid=31|title=Independent news and analysis about Asia's politics, economics, culture and more|work=Asia Sentinel|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/09/stories/2007120955290100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Malaysia considering ISA against Hindraf | date=9 December 2007}}</ref> The detention without trial of the HINDRAF leaders drew negative comments in the foreign press about Badawi's administration and the poor way that the [[Government of Malaysia]] was handling the issue.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Ethnic_Indians_held_under_security_law_Malaysia/articleshow/2619910.cms |title=Ethnic Indians held under security law: Malaysia|work=The Times of India |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216202637/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Ethnic_Indians_held_under_security_law_Malaysia/articleshow/2619910.cms |archivedate=16 December 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/317384/1/.html|title=Channel NewsAsia|work=Channel NewsAsia|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Democratic Action Party]] (DAP) vowed to challenge the detention of the HINDRAF leaders.<ref>[http://www.newkerala.com/one.php?action=fullnews&id=3201] [http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/12/14/nation/19762029&sec=nation]</ref> Despite the arrests, the opposition and most of the NGOs were unfazed and continued to challenge [[UMNO]]'s deconstruction of democracy in Malaysia.

The movement started in Malaysia, has grown global and now has following in UK, Australia, Canada, and USA.\n\nThere have also been candlelight vigils at Hindu temples throughout Malaysia to protest the detention of five leaders of the HINDRAF.

This symbolic act was to occur on 16 February 2008, but the Malaysian Lower House was dissolved for the Federal Elections on 13 February 2008.\n\nIn a dramatic show of force, the police fired teargas and targeted water cannon at several hundred ethnic Tamils at the centre of Kuala Lumpur.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/02/17/stories/2008021750180100.htm | location=Chennai, India | work=The Hindu | title=Hindraf's 'roses campaign' thwarted | date=17 February 2008}}</ref>  More than 200 people were detained by the authorities after being attacked by the police near the site of an Indian temple.<ref>https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080216/wl_asia_afp/malaysiaprotestsrights_080216164742</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.mysinchew.com/node/7133?tid=4 |title=Malaysia: Police Break Up Ethnic Indian Rally, Detain More Than 120 People |date=17 February 2008 |author=ULIA ZAPPEI|work=AP Associated Press|publisher=MySinchew |accessdate=8 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==The impact of HINDRAF on the 12th Malaysian general elections==\nThe 12th general election showed how HINDRAF had become one of the triggers for a major change in the course of the country.  The general dissatisfaction with the regime ruled by UMNO had been brewing for some years and the Hindraf Rally of 25 November caused what has been called a political tsunami in Malaysian politics.\n\nThe ruling UMNO-led government lost its two-thirds majority in Parliament and came close to getting just over half the seats in Parliament from the Peninsula.  HINDRAF, which had barely existed for three years, and was barely known until August 2007, suddenly caught the mood of a large proportion of Malaysians, not only Tamils and Hindus but the Chinese and a sizeable section of the Malays as well, causing a major upset in the process.\n\n==Hindraf declared as illegal organisation==\nAfter several warnings by the Malaysian government HINDRAF was officially banned on 15 October 2008. This was confirmed by the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Malaysian Home Minister]] Datuk Seri Syed Hamid Albar.<ref>http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/10/15/nation/20081015184431&sec=nation</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/legal/general_news/hindraf_declared_an_illegal_organisation.html|title=The Malaysian Bar|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news_lite.php?id=364772|title=Malaysian National News Agency ~ BERNAMA|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn a statement issued by the ministry, Syed Hamid said the decision to declare HINDRAF an illegal organisation was made following the ministry being satisfied with facts and evidence that showed HINDRAF had and was being used for unlawful purposes and posed a threat to public order and morality.\n\n\"Based on powers vested under Section 5 (1) of the Societies Act, HINDRAF from today is declared an illegal organisation,\" he said.\n\nHe said the order was being made as a result of monitoring and investigation of the organisation's activities, since its inception, by the Registrar of Societies (RoS) and the Home Ministry.\n\n==More detentions by the Malaysian government==\nOn 23 October 2008, a group comprising eight men, three women, and a child, were arrested by the police after they tried to hand a memorandum to the Prime Minister's office. It called for the release of the five HNDRAF leaders from detention under the Internal Security Act.\n<ref>http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/10/23/nation/20081023194129&sec=nation Hindraf members arrested in front of PM's office</ref><ref>http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Friday/National/2384293/Article/index_html Hindraf 11 held over illegal assembly</ref>  It was discovered that HINDRAF leader P.Waythamoorthy's six-year-old daughter was amongst the people arrested.<ref>http://mt.m2day.org/2008/content/view/14190/84/ Waythamoorthy's wife, daughter and 10 other Hindraf supporters detained</ref>\n\n==Interlok==\nOn 27 February 2011, HINDRAF organised a demonstration in Kuala Lumpur protesting the government's decision to include the Malay language novel ''[[Interlok]]'' in the school curriculum as compulsory reading for the Malay literature subject for students in secondary 5. HINDRAF alleges that ''Interlok'' contains disparaging remarks against Malaysian Indians and is deemed racist.

To contain the movement while not being able to charge them according to valid evidence-based legal processes, on 12 December 2007 Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi personally signed the detention letters to imprison the HINDRAF leaders under the Internal Security Act (ISA) for two years. Their detention terms are subject to infinite renewal. The reason given for this arrest was that the HINDRAF leadership has had links with international terrorist organisations such as [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE){{citation needed|date=March 2020}} and also supposedly militant organisations like [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS){{citation needed|date=March 2020}} in India.

The general dissatisfaction with the regime ruled by UMNO had been brewing for some years and the Hindraf Rally of 25 November caused what has been called a political tsunami in Malaysian politics.\n\nThe ruling UMNO-led government lost its two-thirds majority in Parliament and came close to getting just over half the seats in Parliament from the Peninsula.  HINDRAF, which had barely existed for three years, and was barely known until August 2007, suddenly caught the mood of a large proportion of Malaysians, not only Tamils and Hindus but the Chinese and a sizeable section of the Malays as well, causing a major upset in the process.\n\n==Hindraf declared as illegal organisation==\nAfter several warnings by the Malaysian government HINDRAF was officially banned on 15 October 2008.
