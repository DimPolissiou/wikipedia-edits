It was established as a for-profit educational television channel. At the time, its broadcasting license dictates that the network is required to devote at least 50% of its airtime to educational programming, and at least 30% of its airtime to children's educational programming. The station was owned by [[Asahi Shimbun]], [[Toei Company]], [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]], and Obunsha.\n\nHowever, the for-profit educational television model eventually proved to be a failure. In 1960, NET began its transformation into a general-purpose television station. It began to broadcast [[anime]] and foreign movies. So as not to run afoul of the educational TV license requirements, NET justified the airing of these programs under the pretext of {{nihongo|\"nurturing a child's emotional range\"|\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u60c5\u64cd\u6559\u80b2\u306e\u305f\u3081|Kodomo no j\u014ds\u014d ky\u014diku no tame}} and {{nihongo|\"introduction of foreign cultures\"|\u5916\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb|Gaikoku bunka no sh\u014dkai}}. At the same time, NET also changed its common name from \"Nihon Educational Television\" to \"NET TV\" (NET\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3).\n\nSeven years later, in 1967, NET aired its first colour broadcast programme. Part of its transformation into a general TV channel would be the April 1971 premiere of the [[Kamen Rider Series]] by the Toei Company and creator [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], the [[tokusatsu]] [[superhero]] series that would make the channel a national hit. It has been its home ever since, joined by yet another toku series, ''[[Super Sentai]]'', in the spring of 1975 (KR left the channel in 1975, only to return in 2000). Aside from these two live action programs, which would become part of its flagship programming, due in part by the work done by Toei's animation branch, the 70s were also marked on NET with great animation classics of national fame, which aired one after the other in the channel and were even exported to other countries, many of these would be part of daily life and culture and helped introduce the world to the [[anime]] genre. Such animations put the channel in direct competition with other stations which broadcast similar programming.\n\nNET's transformation into a general-purpose television station was complete by November 1973, when NET, along with educational channel \"Tokyo Channel 12\" (now [[TV Tokyo]]) in [[Tokyo]] applied and received a general purpose television station license. At the same time, NET renamed itself as NET General Television (\u7dcf\u5408\u5c40NET), which subsequently became the {{Nihongo|\"Asahi National Broadcasting Company, Limited\"|\u5168\u56fd\u671d\u65e5\u653e\u9001\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|Zenkoku Asahi H\u014ds\u014d Kabushiki-gaisha|extra=commonly named \"TV Asahi\"}} on April 1, 1977. Five years later, TV Asahi became the official network, until 1999, for yet another Toei live action franchise, the [[Metal Hero Series]].\n\nIn 1996, TV Asahi established the {{Nihongo|'''All-Nippon News Network (ANN)'''|\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30cb\u30c3\u30dd\u30f3\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af|\u014cru Nippon Ny\u016bsu Nettow\u0101ku}}, and began a number of reforms, including the unification of all presentation styles on its regional networks and the creation of a new logo to give Asahi the look and feel of a national television network. On October 1, 2003, TV Asahi moved its head office from its Ark Hills Studio to [[Roppongi Hills]], and the station was renamed \"TV Asahi Corporation\", with the name presented as \"tv asahi\" on-screen.\n\nThe transmission of international aquatics competitions, World Cup football matches, and creation of popular late-night TV programs contributed to a rise in ratings for TV Asahi, and lifted the TV station from its popularly ridiculed \"perpetual fourth place\" finish into second place, right behind [[fuji Television|Fuji TV]], by 2005.\n\nThe station also launched its own [[mascot]], {{Nihongo|''G\u014d EX Panda''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d1\u30f3\u30c0|G\u014d Ekkusu Panda}}, also known as {{Nihongo|''G\u014d-chan''|\u30b4\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3002}} G\u014d-chan is currently seen on TV Asahi's opening sign-on ID.\n\n==Branding==\nTV Asahi's current branding were created by UK design collective [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]] (some members work as the electronic music group [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]) along with TV Asahi's in-house design department in 2003. It comprises a set of computer-generated \"sticks\" in white background, which changes in colour and movement along with the background music that accompanies the idents. TV Asahi also uses a brief [[eyecatch]] of its sticks animation at the top-left of the screen after commercial breaks. The background music used for TV Asahi's sign-on and sign-off videos are Underworld's ''[[Born Slippy .NUXX#Born Slippy .NUXX 2003|Born Slippy .NUXX 2003]]'' and ''Rez''. TV Asahi later updated its sign-on and sign-off video in 2008 with a revised version of computer-generated \"sticks\" animation and new background music. TV Asahi's slogan ''New Air, On Air'' appears at the top of its name. It can be seen on TV Asahi's YouTube channel, which in 2011-12, was replaced by its mascot, Go-Chan.\n\nThe company writes its name in lower-case letters, ''tv asahi'', in its logo and public-image materials. Normally, the station branding on-screen appears as either \"/tv asahi\" or \"tv asahi\\\". The station's watermark appearance is the stick at the top with the station's name at the bottom. The fonts used by TV Asahi for the written parts are [[Akzidenz Grotesk|Akzidenz Grotesk Bold]] (English) and [[Hiragino|Hiragino Kaku Gothic W8]] (Japanese).<ref>http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/vi/flash_content/index.html http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/vi/flash_content/index.html</ref>\n\n==TV broadcasting==\nSince 2004, the funding of this station is through [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]].\n{{Infobox broadcast\n| call_letters             = JOEX-TV<br>JOEX-DTV\n| station_logo             = TV Asahi Logo.svg\n| station_slogan           = ''New Air, On Air.''<br>(2008-present)\n| station_branding         = tv asahi<br />\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5<br />''EX''\n| digital                  = JOEX-DTV, Channel 24 ([[UHF]] \u2013 [[Virtual channel|LCN]] 5)\n| other_chs                = '''[[Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 45<br />\n'''[[Tama, Tokyo]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 57<br />\n'''[[Chichi-jima|Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 59<br />\n'''[[Mito, Ibaraki]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 36<br />Digital: Channel 17<br />\n'''[[Hitachi, Ibaraki]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Utsunomiya, Tochigi]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 41<br />Digital: Channel 17<br />\n'''[[Maebashi, Gunma]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />Digital: Channel 43<br />\n'''[[Chichibu, Saitama]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 38<br />\n'''[[Narita, Chiba]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 59<br />\n'''[[Tateyama, Chiba]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Minato Mirai 21|Yokohama Minato Mirai 21, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka-Kurihama, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 35<br />\n'''[[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 41<br />Digital: Channel 24<br />\n'''[[Kitadait\u014d, Okinawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 48<br />\n'''[[Minami Daito, Okinawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60\n| affiliations             = [[All-Nippon News Network]]\n| founded                  = {{start date and age|1957}}\n| airdate                  = November 1, 1957\n| location                 = [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d Region, Japan]]\n| callsign_meaning         = JOEX = '''J'''apan's'''O'''riginal Free-to-Air '''E'''ducational TV Station<br>'''X''' (10, former channel assignment)\n| sister_stations          = '''BS Asahi'''<br>'''Tele Asa Channel 1'''<br>'''Tele Asa Channel 2'''<br>'''Zee Asahi''' \n| former_callsigns         = \n| owner                    = TV Asahi Corporation\n| former_channel_numbers   = ch.# 10 ([[analog television|analog]], 1957-2011), ch. #5 ([[digital television|digital]])\n| former_affiliations      = \n| effective_radiated_power = 10 kW (68 kW [[Effective radiated power|ERP]])\n| HAAT                     = \n| class                    = \n| facility_id              = \n| coordinates              = {{Coord|35|39|31|N|139|44|44|E|type:landmark_scale:2000}}\n| homepage                 = http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/\n}}\n\n===Analog===\n\n(until July 24, 2011 only for 44 out of 47 prefectures)\n\n'''JOEX-TV''' \u2013 TV Asahi Analog Television (\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3)\n* [[Tokyo Tower]] \u2013 VHF Channel 10\n;

The company also owns [[All-Nippon News Network]].\n\n==Headquarters==\n[[File:Tv asahi.jpg|thumb|Sign of TV asahi in headquarters since 2003]]\nIn 2003, the company headquarters moved to a new building designed by [[Fumihiko Maki]] at: 6-9-1 [[Roppongi]], [[Minato, Tokyo]], Japan.\n\nSome of TV Asahi's departments and subsidiaries, such as TV Asahi Productions and Take Systems, are still located at ''TV Asahi Center'', the company's former headquarters of 1986\u20132003. It is located at [[Ark Hills]], not far from its headquarters.\n[[File:View of TV Asahi.jpg|thumb|View of TV Asahi headquarters since 2003]]\n\n==History==\n[[Image:TVAsahi.jpg|thumb|TV Asahi's annexe at Ark Hills, not far from its headquarters since 2003]]\n\nTV Asahi began as {{nihongo|\"Nihon Educational Television Co., Ltd.\" (NET)|\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e\u65e5\u672c\u6559\u80b2\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3|Kabushiki-gaisha Nihon Ky\u014diku Terebi|extra=\"The Japanese Educational Television Company\"}} on November 1, 1957. It was established as a for-profit educational television channel. At the time, its broadcasting license dictates that the network is required to devote at least 50% of its airtime to educational programming, and at least 30% of its airtime to children's educational programming. The station was owned by [[Asahi Shimbun]], [[Toei Company]], [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun]], and Obunsha.\n\nHowever, the for-profit educational television model eventually proved to be a failure. In 1960, NET began its transformation into a general-purpose television station. It began to broadcast [[anime]] and foreign movies. So as not to run afoul of the educational TV license requirements, NET justified the airing of these programs under the pretext of {{nihongo|\"nurturing a child's emotional range\"|\u5b50\u4f9b\u306e\u60c5\u64cd\u6559\u80b2\u306e\u305f\u3081|Kodomo no j\u014ds\u014d ky\u014diku no tame}} and {{nihongo|\"introduction of foreign cultures\"|\u5916\u56fd\u6587\u5316\u306e\u7d39\u4ecb|Gaikoku bunka no sh\u014dkai}}. At the same time, NET also changed its common name from \"Nihon Educational Television\" to \"NET TV\" (NET\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3).\n\nSeven years later, in 1967, NET aired its first colour broadcast programme. Part of its transformation into a general TV channel would be the April 1971 premiere of the [[Kamen Rider Series]] by the Toei Company and creator [[Shotaro Ishinomori]], the [[tokusatsu]] [[superhero]] series that would make the channel a national hit. It has been its home ever since, joined by yet another toku series, ''[[Super Sentai]]'', in the spring of 1975 (KR left the channel in 1975, only to return in 2000). Aside from these two live action programs, which would become part of its flagship programming, due in part by the work done by Toei's animation branch, the 70s were also marked on NET with great animation classics of national fame, which aired one after the other in the channel and were even exported to other countries, many of these would be part of daily life and culture and helped introduce the world to the [[anime]] genre. Such animations put the channel in direct competition with other stations which broadcast similar programming.\n\nNET's transformation into a general-purpose television station was complete by November 1973, when NET, along with educational channel \"Tokyo Channel 12\" (now [[TV Tokyo]]) in [[Tokyo]] applied and received a general purpose television station license. At the same time, NET renamed itself as NET General Television (\u7dcf\u5408\u5c40NET), which subsequently became the {{Nihongo|\"Asahi National Broadcasting Company, Limited\"|\u5168\u56fd\u671d\u65e5\u653e\u9001\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e|Zenkoku Asahi H\u014ds\u014d Kabushiki-gaisha|extra=commonly named \"TV Asahi\"}} on April 1, 1977. Five years later, TV Asahi became the official network, until 1999, for yet another Toei live action franchise, the [[Metal Hero Series]].\n\nIn 1996, TV Asahi established the {{Nihongo|'''All-Nippon News Network (ANN)'''|\u30aa\u30fc\u30eb\u30cb\u30c3\u30dd\u30f3\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cd\u30c3\u30c8\u30ef\u30fc\u30af|\u014cru Nippon Ny\u016bsu Nettow\u0101ku}}, and began a number of reforms, including the unification of all presentation styles on its regional networks and the creation of a new logo to give Asahi the look and feel of a national television network. On October 1, 2003, TV Asahi moved its head office from its Ark Hills Studio to [[Roppongi Hills]], and the station was renamed \"TV Asahi Corporation\", with the name presented as \"tv asahi\" on-screen.\n\nThe transmission of international aquatics competitions, World Cup football matches, and creation of popular late-night TV programs contributed to a rise in ratings for TV Asahi, and lifted the TV station from its popularly ridiculed \"perpetual fourth place\" finish into second place, right behind [[fuji Television|Fuji TV]], by 2005.\n\nThe station also launched its own [[mascot]], {{Nihongo|''G\u014d EX Panda''|\u30b4\u30fc\u30a8\u30af\u30b9\u30d1\u30f3\u30c0|G\u014d Ekkusu Panda}}, also known as {{Nihongo|''G\u014d-chan''|\u30b4\u30fc\u3061\u3083\u3093\u3002}} G\u014d-chan is currently seen on TV Asahi's opening sign-on ID.\n\n==Branding==\nTV Asahi's current branding were created by UK design collective [[Tomato (design collective)|Tomato]] (some members work as the electronic music group [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]]) along with TV Asahi's in-house design department in 2003. It comprises a set of computer-generated \"sticks\" in white background, which changes in colour and movement along with the background music that accompanies the idents. TV Asahi also uses a brief [[eyecatch]] of its sticks animation at the top-left of the screen after commercial breaks. The background music used for TV Asahi's sign-on and sign-off videos are Underworld's ''[[Born Slippy .NUXX#Born Slippy .NUXX 2003|Born Slippy .NUXX 2003]]'' and ''Rez''. TV Asahi later updated its sign-on and sign-off video in 2008 with a revised version of computer-generated \"sticks\" animation and new background music. TV Asahi's slogan ''New Air, On Air'' appears at the top of its name. It can be seen on TV Asahi's YouTube channel, which in 2011-12, was replaced by its mascot, Go-Chan.\n\nThe company writes its name in lower-case letters, ''tv asahi'', in its logo and public-image materials. Normally, the station branding on-screen appears as either \"/tv asahi\" or \"tv asahi\\\". The station's watermark appearance is the stick at the top with the station's name at the bottom. The fonts used by TV Asahi for the written parts are [[Akzidenz Grotesk|Akzidenz Grotesk Bold]] (English) and [[Hiragino|Hiragino Kaku Gothic W8]] (Japanese).<ref>http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/vi/flash_content/index.html http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/vi/flash_content/index.html</ref>\n\n==TV broadcasting==\nSince 2004, the funding of this station is through [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]].\n{{Infobox broadcast\n| call_letters             = JOEX-TV<br>JOEX-DTV\n| station_logo             = TV Asahi Logo.svg\n| station_slogan           = ''New Air, On Air.''<br>(2008-present)\n| station_branding         = tv asahi<br />\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5<br />''EX''\n| digital                  = JOEX-DTV, Channel 24 ([[UHF]] \u2013 [[Virtual channel|LCN]] 5)\n| other_chs                = '''[[Hachi\u014dji, Tokyo]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 45<br />\n'''[[Tama, Tokyo]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 57<br />\n'''[[Chichi-jima|Chichi-jima, Ogasawara Islands]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 59<br />\n'''[[Mito, Ibaraki]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 36<br />Digital: Channel 17<br />\n'''[[Hitachi, Ibaraki]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Utsunomiya, Tochigi]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 41<br />Digital: Channel 17<br />\n'''[[Maebashi, Gunma]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />Digital: Channel 43<br />\n'''[[Chichibu, Saitama]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 38<br />\n'''[[Narita, Chiba]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 59<br />\n'''[[Tateyama, Chiba]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Minato Mirai 21|Yokohama Minato Mirai 21, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60<br />\n'''[[Yokosuka, Kanagawa|Yokosuka-Kurihama, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 35<br />\n'''[[Hiratsuka, Kanagawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 41<br />Digital: Channel 24<br />\n'''[[Kitadait\u014d, Okinawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 48<br />\n'''[[Minami Daito, Okinawa]]'''<br />Analog: Channel 60\n| affiliations             = [[All-Nippon News Network]]\n| founded                  = {{start date and age|1957}}\n| airdate                  = November 1, 1957\n| location                 = [[Kant\u014d region|Kant\u014d Region, Japan]]\n| callsign_meaning         = JOEX = '''J'''apan's'''O'''riginal Free-to-Air '''E'''ducational TV Station<br>'''X''' (10, former channel assignment)\n| sister_stations          = '''BS Asahi'''<br>'''Tele Asa Channel 1'''<br>'''Tele Asa Channel 2'''<br>'''Zee Asahi''' \n| former_callsigns         = \n| owner                    = TV Asahi Corporation\n| former_channel_numbers   = ch.# 10 ([[analog television|analog]], 1957-2011), ch. #5 ([[digital television|digital]])\n| former_affiliations      = \n| effective_radiated_power = 10 kW (68 kW [[Effective radiated power|ERP]])\n| HAAT                     = \n| class                    = \n| facility_id              = \n| coordinates              = {{Coord|35|39|31|N|139|44|44|E|type:landmark_scale:2000}}\n| homepage                 = http://www.tv-asahi.co.jp/\n}}\n\n===Analog===\n\n(until July 24, 2011 only for 44 out of 47 prefectures)\n\n'''JOEX-TV''' \u2013 TV Asahi Analog Television (\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u671d\u65e5\u30a2\u30ca\u30ed\u30b0\u30c6\u30ec\u30d3\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3)\n* [[Tokyo Tower]] \u2013 VHF Channel 10\n;

Requests were sent, however, by Kalf\u00fcn's successor, Mufarrag ibn Sallam, to the [[Abbasid caliph]], [[al-Mutawakkil]], in [[Baghdad]], and his provincial governor of [[Egypt]] for recognition of the conquest with the title of ''[[wali]]'', a [[governor]] ruling over a province of the [[Caliphate]], which was granted.<ref name=kreutz1/> Mufarrag expanded Muslim influence and enlarged the territory of the emirate.\n\nThe third and last emir of Bari was Sawdan, who came to power around 857 after the murder of his predecessor Mufarrag. He invaded the lands of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[Principality of Benevento]], forcing [[Adelchis of Benevento|Prince Adelchis]] to pay [[tribute]].

Despite a bloody battle, the emir successfully entered his capital.\n\nThe emirate of Bari lasted long enough to enter into relations with its Christian neighbours.<ref name=kreutz2/> According to the ''[[Chronicon Salernitanum]]'', ambassadors (''legati'') were sent to [[Salerno]] where they stayed in the episcopal palace, much to the dismay of the bishop.<ref name=kreutz2/> Bari also served as a refuge for at least one political rival of the [[Emperor Louis II]], a man of [[Duchy of Spoleto|Spoleto]] who fled to it during a revolt. In 865 Louis, perhaps pressured by the Church, always uncomfortable with a Muslim state in Italy's midst, issued a [[capitulary]] calling upon the fighting men of [[northern Italy]] to gather at [[Lucera]] in the spring of 866 for an assault on Bari.<ref name=kreutz3>Kreutz, 40.</ref> It is unknown, from contemporary sources, whether this force ever marched on Bari, but in the summer of that year the emperor was touring the [[Campania]] with his empress, [[Engelberga]], and receiving strong urging from the Lombard princes&mdash;[[Adelchis of Benevento]], [[Guaifer of Salerno]], and [[Landulf II of Capua]]&mdash;to attack Bari again.<ref name=kreutz3/>\n\nIt was not until the spring of 867 that Louis took action against the emirate. He immediately besieged [[Matera]] and [[Oria, Italy|Oria]], recently conquered, and burnt the former.<ref name=kreutz4>Kreutz, 41.</ref> Oria was a prosperous locale before the Muslim conquest; Barbara Kreutz thus conjectures that Matera resisted Louis while Oria welcomed him: the former thus was razed.<ref>Kreutz, 172, n26. The capture of the cities is referred to both in [[Erchempert]] and [[Lupus Protospatharius]].</ref> This may have severed communications between Bari and [[Taranto]], the other pole of Muslim power in southern Italy.<ref name=kreutz4/> Louis established a garrison at [[Canosa]] on the frontier between Benevento and Bari, but retired to the former by March 868.<ref name=kreutz4/> It was probably at about this time that Louis entered into negotiations with the new Byzantine emperor, [[Basil I]]. A marriage between Louis's daughter and Basil's eldest son, Constantine, was probably discussed in return for [[Byzantine navy|Byzantine naval]] assistance in the taking of Bari.<ref name=kreutz5>Kreutz, 42.</ref> The ''Chronicon Salernitanum'' inconsistently attaches the initiative for such talks to Louis and then Basil.\n\nThe joint attack was projected for late in the summer of 869 and Louis remained at [[Benevento]] planning as late as June. The Byzantine fleet&mdash;of four hundred ships if the ''[[Annales Bertiniani]]'' are to be trusted&mdash;arrived under the command of [[Niketas Ooryphas|Nicetas]] with the expectation that Louis would hand over his daughter immediately.<ref name=kreutz6>Kreutz, 43.</ref> This he refused to do, for no known reason, but perhaps because Nicetas had refused to recognise his imperial title, since Louis later refers in a letter to the commander's \"insulting behaviour\".<ref name=kreutz7>Kreutz, 44.</ref> Perhaps, however, the fleet simply arrived too late in autumn.<ref name=kreutz7/>\n\nIn 870 the Bariot Muslims stepped up their raids, going so far as to ravage the [[Gargano Peninsula]] including the [[Sanctuary of Monte Sant'Angelo]].<ref name=kreutz8>Kreutz, 45.</ref> The Emperor Louis organised a response, fighting his way deep into [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]] but bypassing major population centres like Bari or Taranto. A few towns were apparently freed of Muslim control and the various Muslim bands encountered were universally defeated.<ref name=kreutz8/> Probably encouraged by these successes, Louis attacked Bari with a ground force of Franks, Germans and Lombards and aided by a [[Croatia]]n fleet (of ''[[Sclaveni|Sclavini]]'').<ref name=kreutz8/> In February 871 the citadel fell and Sawdan was captured and taken to Benevento in chains.<ref name=kreutz8/> The report found in the ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' of [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] that the Byzantines played a major role in the city's fall is probably a concoction.<ref>Kreutz, 173 n45.</ref> \n\n==List of emirs==\n*Kalf\u00fcn (Khalfun), 841\u2013{{circa}}852\n*Mufarrag ibn Sallam, {{circa}}852\u2013{{circa}}857\n*Sawdan (Sawd\u0101n), {{circa}}857\u2013871\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n===Primary sources===\n{{wikisource|The Origins of the Islamic State}}\nThe following are available as part of Sources of Lombard History at the Institut f\u00fcr Mittelalter Forschung:\n{{refbegin}}\n*[http://www.oeaw.ac.at/gema/benedicti.htm ''Chronica Sancti Benedicti Casinensis'']\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070422122723/http://www.oeaw.ac.at/gema/salerni.htm ''Chronicon Salernitanum] \n*[[Erchempert]].

It was the most lasting episode in the [[history of Islam in southern Italy|history of Islam in peninsular southern Italy]].\n\nBari first became the object of [[Aghlabid]] raids in late 840 or early 841, when it was briefly occupied.<ref>Kreutz, 25.</ref> According to [[Al-Baladhuri]], Bari was conquered from the [[Byzantine Empire]] by Kalf\u00fcn around 847, a ''[[mawla]]''&mdash;perhaps a servant or escaped slave&mdash;of the [[Aghlabid]] [[Emir of Africa]].<ref name=kreutz1>Kreutz, 38.</ref> Kalf\u00fcn (Khalfun) was probably of Berber stock, possibly from the [[Emirate of Sicily]] originally. The conquest was seen by contemporary [[Muslims]] as unimportant, having been carried out by a minor figure without the support of any other Muslim state. Requests were sent, however, by Kalf\u00fcn's successor, Mufarrag ibn Sallam, to the [[Abbasid caliph]], [[al-Mutawakkil]], in [[Baghdad]], and his provincial governor of [[Egypt]] for recognition of the conquest with the title of ''[[wali]]'', a [[governor]] ruling over a province of the [[Caliphate]], which was granted.<ref name=kreutz1/> Mufarrag expanded Muslim influence and enlarged the territory of the emirate.\n\nThe third and last emir of Bari was Sawdan, who came to power around 857 after the murder of his predecessor Mufarrag. He invaded the lands of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[Principality of Benevento]], forcing [[Adelchis of Benevento|Prince Adelchis]] to pay [[tribute]]. In 864 he finally obtained the official investiture requested initially by Mufarrag.
