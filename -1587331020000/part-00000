B. Myers, ''Child Protection in America: Past, Present, and Future'' (NY: Oxford University Press, 2006), 14</ref> During the nineteenth century, provision of Catholic charity was for the most part a local matter. However, the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]], which was organized in the United States in 1845 in St. Louis, Missouri, soon spread to other cities and dioceses. The SVDP Society held national meetings, which served as a point of contact for members working at the local level, and played a significant role in the formation of the National Conference of Catholic Charities.\n\nBy 1900, there were more than 800 Catholic institutions dedicated to the care of children, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled. According to Jack Hansan of the Social Welfare History Project, by 1910 about half of the approximately 15&nbsp;million Catholics in the United States lived in poverty. Only three diocesan charity agencies were organized prior to 1910. The [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|San Francisco earthquake]] of 1906 and ensuing fire prompted the Archdiocese of San Francisco to form Catholic Charities CYO the following year to assist destitute families and care for children who were orphaned by the disaster.<ref name=hansan>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/organizations/catholic-charities-usa/|title=Catholic Charities USA - Social Welfare History Project|date=March 19, 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===National Conference of Catholic Charities===\nOn September 25, 1910, representatives of many service agencies met at The [[Catholic University of America]] at the invitation of its rector, Bishop [[Thomas Joseph Shahan|Thomas J. Shahan]], and formed the National Conference of Catholic Charities (NCCC) to support and coordinate their efforts.<ref>Larry J. Snyder, \"Introduction\", in J. Brian Hehir, ed., ''Catholic Charities USA: 100 Years at the Intersection of Charity and Justice'', Kindle edition (Liturgical Press, 2010), location 80</ref> They held their final meeting at the [[White House]] at the invitation of President [[William Howard Taft|Taft]].<ref>Fred Kammer, \"Mission and Identity\", in Hehir, ''Catholic Charities USA'', location 2213</ref>\n\nThe new organization drew its inspiration from the social teachings of Pope Leo XII, whose ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891), in one scholar's words, sought to \"free [the Church] from paralyzing resistance to bourgeois civilization by shifting attention from the intractable problems of church and state to the social question, where a more flexible pastoral and evangelical approach might be possible.\"<ref>J. Brian Hehir, \"Theology, Social Teaching, and Catholic Charities\", in Hehir, ''Catholic Charities USA'', location 382</ref> The organization's founding also paralleled the development of social work as a profession and the increasing cooperation among sectarian charitable organizations. Msgr. [[William J. Kerby]], the first executive director of NCCC, described the problems a few years later: \"The intense individualism of institutional and geographical units of the Church's life has ... led to a variety and resourcefulness that have been admirable. But it has resulted in a mutual independence and lack of coordination that have undoubtedly interfered with progress in certain ways....\"<ref>Ann Patrick Conrad and M. Vincentia Joseph, \"The Rise of Professionalism\", in Hehir, ''Catholic Charities USA'', location 694</ref> Several Catholic educational institutions established social work programs in the decade after the founding of the NCCC, beginning with [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola of Chicago]] (1914) and [[Fordham University|Fordham]] (1916).<ref>Conrad and Joseph, \"Professionalism\", in Hehir, ''Catholic Charities USA'', location 779</ref>\n\nIn 1917 the NCCC established the ''Catholic Charities Review'' to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and theories, and a resource for those who could not attend meetings. ''Catholic Charities Review ''was the successor publication to the ''Vincentians\u2019 Quarterly.''<ref name=\"hansan\"/>\n\nMonsignor John O'Grady, a native of Ireland, worked alongside Kerby for several years. When Kerby stepped down as Executive Secretary in 1920, O'Grady became his successor. O'Grady became acquainted with [[Jane Addams]], founder of [[Hull House]], while studying in Chicago.<ref name=hansan/> Under his leadership, by 1931 there were fifty-eight diocesan organization functioning. Diocesan agencies began to expand their activities from dealing almost exclusively with the care of children to addressing wider issues of family welfare. The greatest challenge of O'Grady's tenure was the [[Great Depression]]. He served forty years as executive director and frequently spoke for the organization on matters of public policy. He supported the Social Security Act of 1935 and federal housing legislation. O'Grady fought against passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|McCarran\u2013Walter Act]]. The bill restricted immigration into the U.S., making it more difficult for World War II refugees to enter the United States. O'Grady said that the bill, which continued a national quota system that favored immigrants from Western European nations, \"perpetuates the doctrine of Nordic superiority.\"<ref>Msgr. John O'Grady, [http://cuomeka.wrlc.org/exhibits/show/immigration/documents/nordic \"The McCarran Immigration Bill: the Perpetuation of the Doctrine of Nordic Superiority is the Basic Question\"], Commonweal, June 20, 1952</ref>\n\nIn March 1949, O'Grady, executive secretary of NCCC, testified before the [[House Ways and Means Committee]] in opposition to legislation proposed by the Truman administration that would have created a program of federal grants to support state relief and welfare programs. He said: \"It envisages a complete governmental program that will virtually take over the entire field of child welfare. How can we maintain our spirit of Christian charity, our spirit of brotherhood, without the appeal of the great charitable institutions for the care of children?\" He said it would \"bring the Federal Government with all its rules and regulations into every community in the United States to set up governmental programs for the care of children\" and that the legislation implied \"national control over family life\". He believed that some states were legally prohibited from purchasing services from religious organizations, and cited Pennsylvania as one where \"Catholic and other religious childcare programs would be practically wiped out.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Morris|first=John D.|title=Catholic Attacks Truman on Relief|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/03/11/84199950.pdf|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 11, 1949}}</ref> In April, NCCC opposed Truman's proposed national health insurance program as well, and both measures were defeated.<ref>Monte M.

Catholic Charities President Rev. J. Bryan Hehir explained the practice: \"If we could design the system ourselves, we would not participate in adoptions to gay couples, but we can't. We have to balance various goods.\" The agency had never sought an exemption from the state's anti-discrimination statute,<ref name=globe2005>''Boston Globe'': [http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/10/22/globe_archdiocesan_agency_aids_adoption_by_gays Patricia Wen, \"Archdiocesan Agency Aids in Adoption by Gay\", October 22, 2005], accessed February 23, 2012, [http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/news/globe-agency-aids-adoption-by-gays.pdf also available here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110803220533/http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/news/globe-agency-aids-adoption-by-gays.pdf |date=August 3, 2011 }}</ref> which had taken effect in 1989.<ref>''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/01/us/a-gay-rights-law-is-voted-in-massachusetts.html \"A Gay Rights Law Is Voted in Massachusetts\", November 1, 1989], accessed February 24, 2012</ref><ref group=n>According to the ''Boston Globe'', \"The children placed with the gay couples are among those most difficult to place\" because they were older or had physical or emotional difficulties. Peter Meade, the chairman of the board of Catholic Charities Boston, took the position that the agency should welcome same-sex couples as parents: \"What we do is facilitate adoptions to loving couples. I see no evidence that any child is being harmed.\" A spokesperson for the agency said that children placed with same-sex couples fared as well as those place with different-sex couples.</ref>\n\nIn December 2005, the lay-dominated board of Catholic Charities of Boston voted unanimously to continue gay adoptions. On February 28, 2006, Archbishop [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Se\u00e1n P. O'Malley]] and Hehir met with Governor [[Mitt Romney]] to make the case for an exemption from the state's non-discrimination statute, but Romney told them he was unable to help. They considered and rejected the idea of a lawsuit. On March 10, O'Malley and leaders of Catholic Charities of the [[Archdiocese of Boston]] announced that the agency would terminate its adoption work effective June 30, rather than continue to place children under the guardianship of homosexuals. The statement did not distinguish between gay and lesbian individuals and those in same-sex relationships.<ref group=\"n\">Massachusetts had recognized same-sex marriages since May 2004.

In Illinois, adults who adopt or become foster care providers must obtain a foster care license from one of 57 private child welfare agencies or directly from the Department of Children and Family Services.

B. Myers, ''Child Protection in America: Past, Present, and Future'' (NY: Oxford University Press, 2006), 14</ref> During the nineteenth century, provision of Catholic charity was for the most part a local matter. However, the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul]], which was organized in the United States in 1845 in St. Louis, Missouri, soon spread to other cities and dioceses. The SVDP Society held national meetings, which served as a point of contact for members working at the local level, and played a significant role in the formation of the National Conference of Catholic Charities.\n\nBy 1900, there were more than 800 Catholic institutions dedicated to the care of children, the elderly, the sick, and the disabled. According to Jack Hansan of the Social Welfare History Project, by 1910 about half of the approximately 15&nbsp;million Catholics in the United States lived in poverty. Only three diocesan charity agencies were organized prior to 1910. The [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|San Francisco earthquake]] of 1906 and ensuing fire prompted the Archdiocese of San Francisco to form Catholic Charities CYO the following year to assist destitute families and care for children who were orphaned by the disaster.<ref name=hansan>{{cite web|url=http://www.socialwelfarehistory.com/organizations/catholic-charities-usa/|title=Catholic Charities USA - Social Welfare History Project|date=March 19, 2012|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===National Conference of Catholic Charities===\nOn September 25, 1910, representatives of many service agencies met at The [[Catholic University of America]] at the invitation of its rector, Bishop [[Thomas Joseph Shahan|Thomas J. Shahan]], and formed the National Conference of Catholic Charities (NCCC) to support and coordinate their efforts.<ref>Larry J. Snyder, \"Introduction\", in J. Brian Hehir, ed., ''Catholic Charities USA: 100 Years at the Intersection of Charity and Justice'', Kindle edition (Liturgical Press, 2010), location 80</ref> They held their final meeting at the [[White House]] at the invitation of President [[William Howard Taft|Taft]].<ref>Fred Kammer, \"Mission and Identity\", in Hehir, ''Catholic Charities USA'', location 2213</ref>\n\nThe new organization drew its inspiration from the social teachings of Pope Leo XII, whose ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' (1891), in one scholar's words, sought to \"free [the Church] from paralyzing resistance to bourgeois civilization by shifting attention from the intractable problems of church and state to the social question, where a more flexible pastoral and evangelical approach might be possible.\"<ref>J. Brian Hehir, \"Theology, Social Teaching, and Catholic Charities\", in Hehir, ''Catholic Charities USA'', location 382</ref> The organization's founding also paralleled the development of social work as a profession and the increasing cooperation among sectarian charitable organizations. Msgr. [[William J. Kerby]], the first executive director of NCCC, described the problems a few years later: \"The intense individualism of institutional and geographical units of the Church's life has ... led to a variety and resourcefulness that have been admirable. But it has resulted in a mutual independence and lack of coordination that have undoubtedly interfered with progress in certain ways....\"<ref>Ann Patrick Conrad and M. Vincentia Joseph, \"The Rise of Professionalism\", in Hehir, ''Catholic Charities USA'', location 694</ref> Several Catholic educational institutions established social work programs in the decade after the founding of the NCCC, beginning with [[Loyola University Chicago|Loyola of Chicago]] (1914) and [[Fordham University|Fordham]] (1916).<ref>Conrad and Joseph, \"Professionalism\", in Hehir, ''Catholic Charities USA'', location 779</ref>\n\nIn 1917 the NCCC established the ''Catholic Charities Review'' to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas and theories, and a resource for those who could not attend meetings. ''Catholic Charities Review ''was the successor publication to the ''Vincentians\u2019 Quarterly.''<ref name=\"hansan\"/>\n\nMonsignor John O'Grady, a native of Ireland, worked alongside Kerby for several years. When Kerby stepped down as Executive Secretary in 1920, O'Grady became his successor. O'Grady became acquainted with [[Jane Addams]], founder of [[Hull House]], while studying in Chicago.<ref name=hansan/> Under his leadership, by 1931 there were fifty-eight diocesan organization functioning. Diocesan agencies began to expand their activities from dealing almost exclusively with the care of children to addressing wider issues of family welfare. The greatest challenge of O'Grady's tenure was the [[Great Depression]]. He served forty years as executive director and frequently spoke for the organization on matters of public policy. He supported the Social Security Act of 1935 and federal housing legislation. O'Grady fought against passage of the [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952|McCarran\u2013Walter Act]]. The bill restricted immigration into the U.S., making it more difficult for World War II refugees to enter the United States. O'Grady said that the bill, which continued a national quota system that favored immigrants from Western European nations, \"perpetuates the doctrine of Nordic superiority.\"<ref>Msgr. John O'Grady, [http://cuomeka.wrlc.org/exhibits/show/immigration/documents/nordic \"The McCarran Immigration Bill: the Perpetuation of the Doctrine of Nordic Superiority is the Basic Question\"], Commonweal, June 20, 1952</ref>\n\nIn March 1949, O'Grady, executive secretary of NCCC, testified before the [[House Ways and Means Committee]] in opposition to legislation proposed by the Truman administration that would have created a program of federal grants to support state relief and welfare programs. He said: \"It envisages a complete governmental program that will virtually take over the entire field of child welfare. How can we maintain our spirit of Christian charity, our spirit of brotherhood, without the appeal of the great charitable institutions for the care of children?\" He said it would \"bring the Federal Government with all its rules and regulations into every community in the United States to set up governmental programs for the care of children\" and that the legislation implied \"national control over family life\". He believed that some states were legally prohibited from purchasing services from religious organizations, and cited Pennsylvania as one where \"Catholic and other religious childcare programs would be practically wiped out.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Morris|first=John D.|title=Catholic Attacks Truman on Relief|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1949/03/11/84199950.pdf|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 11, 1949}}</ref> In April, NCCC opposed Truman's proposed national health insurance program as well, and both measures were defeated.<ref>Monte M.

They considered and rejected the idea of a lawsuit. On March 10, O'Malley and leaders of Catholic Charities of the [[Archdiocese of Boston]] announced that the agency would terminate its adoption work effective June 30, rather than continue to place children under the guardianship of homosexuals.
