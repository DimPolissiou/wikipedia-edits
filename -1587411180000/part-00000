A water wheel consists of a wheel (usually constructed from wood or metal), with a number of [[blade]]s or [[bucket]]s arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface.\n\nWater wheels were still in commercial use well into the 20th century but they are no longer in common use. Uses included milling flour in [[gristmill]]s, grinding wood into pulp for [[papermaking]], hammering [[wrought iron]], machining, ore crushing and pounding fiber for use in the manufacture of [[cloth]].\n\nSome water wheels are fed by water from a mill pond, which is formed when a flowing stream is dammed. A channel for the water flowing to or from a water wheel is called a [[mill race]]. The race bringing water from the mill pond to the water wheel is a '''headrace'''; the one carrying water after it has left the wheel is commonly referred to as a '''tailrace'''.<ref name=\"Ref-1\">[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tailrace Dictionary definition of \"tailrace\"]</ref>\n\nIn the mid to late 18th century [[John Smeaton]]'s scientific investigation of the water wheel led to significant increases in efficiency supplying much needed power for the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref name=\"Robinson&Musson\">\n{{cite book\n|title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution\n |url=https://archive.org/details/sciencetechnolog00aemu\n |url-access=registration\n |last=Musson\n|author2=Robinson\n |year=1969 |publisher =University of Toronto Press\n|location=\n|isbn= |page=[https://archive.org/details/sciencetechnolog00aemu/page/69 69]}}\n</ref><ref name=\"Thomson 2009\">{{cite book |title      = Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790-1865\n |last       = Thomson\n |first      = Ross\n |authorlink = \n |year       = 2009\n |publisher  = The Johns Hopkins University Press\n |location   = Baltimore, MD\n |isbn       = 978-0-8018-9141-0\n |page       = [https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom/page/34 34]\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom/page/34\n}}\n</ref>\n\nWater wheels began being displaced by the smaller, less expensive and more efficient [[turbine]], developed by [[Beno\u00eet Fourneyron]], beginning with his first model in 1827.<ref name=\"Thomson 2009\"/>  Turbines are capable of handling high ''[[Hydrostatic head|heads]]'', or [[elevation]]s, that exceed the capability of practical-sized waterwheels.\n\nThe main difficulty of water wheels is their dependence on flowing water, which limits where they can be located. Modern [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dam]]s can be viewed as the descendants of the water wheel, as they too take advantage of the movement of water downhill.\n\n== Types ==\nWater wheels come in two basic designs:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/211_fall2010.web.dir/Brooks/types-of-water-wheels.html|title=Types of Water Wheels \u2013 The Physics of a Water Wheel|website=ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-10}}</ref>\n* a horizontal wheel with a vertical axle; or\n* a vertical wheel with a horizontal axle.\nThe latter can be subdivided according to where the water hits the wheel into backshot (pitch-back<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pitch-back]</ref>) overshot, breastshot, undershot, and stream-wheels.<ref name=\"Stream wheel term and specifics\">[http://www.energy.soton.ac.uk/hydro/waterwheels.html Stream wheel term and specifics]</ref><ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/undershot%20wheel Merriam Webster]</ref><ref>[http://www.powerinthelandscape.co.uk/water/water_wheels.html Power in the Landscape]</ref>\nThe term undershot can refer to any wheel where the water passes under the wheel<ref>[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/undershot Collins English Dictionary]</ref> but it usually implies that the water entry is low on the wheel.\n\nOvershot and backshot water wheels are typically used where the available height difference is more than a couple of meters. Breastshot wheels are more suited to large flows with a moderate [[Hydrostatic head|head]]. Undershot and stream wheel use large flows at little or no head.\n\nThere is often an associated [[millpond]], a reservoir for storing water and hence energy until it is needed. Larger heads store more potential energy for the same amount of water so the reservoirs for overshot and backshot wheels tend to be smaller than for breast shot wheels.\n\nOvershot and pitchback water wheels are suitable where there is a small stream with a height difference of more than {{Convert|2|m|ft|abbr=|round=0.5}}, often in association with a small reservoir.

However, if it delivers the required power then the efficiency is of secondary importance. It is usually mounted inside a mill building below the working floor. A jet of water is directed on to the paddles of the water wheel, causing them to turn. This is a simple system usually without gearing so that the vertical axle of the water wheel becomes the drive spindle of the mill.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n=== Stream ===\n[[File:Stream waterwheel simple.svg|thumb|150px|Stream shot waterwheel]]\n\nA stream wheel<ref name=\"Stream wheel term and specifics\"/><ref name=\"PITLtypes\"/> is a vertically mounted water wheel that is rotated by the water in a water course striking paddles or blades at the bottom of the wheel. This type of water wheel is the oldest type of horizontal axis wheel.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} They are also known as [[free surface]] wheels because the water is not constrained by millraces or wheel pit. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nStream wheels are cheaper and simpler to build, and have less of an environmental impact, than other type of wheel. They do not constitute a major change of the river. Their disadvantages are their low efficiency, which means that they generate less power and can only be used where the flow rate is sufficient. A typical flat board undershot wheel uses about 20 percent of the energy in the flow of water striking the wheel as measured by English civil engineer [[John Smeaton]] in the 18th century.<ref>The History of Science and Technology by Bryan Bunch with Alexander Hellmans pp.114</ref> More modern wheels have higher efficiencies.\n\nStream wheels gain little or no advantage from [[hydrostatic head|head]], a difference in water level.\n\nStream wheels mounted on floating platforms are often referred to as hip wheels and the mill as a [[ship mill]]. They were sometimes mounted immediately downstream from [[bridges]] where the flow restriction of the bridge piers increased the speed of the current.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nHistorically they were very inefficient but major advances were made in the eighteenth century.<ref name=\"ASMEnoria\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.asme.org/getmedia/ac3c3ad4-4e16-46e3-b153-e586ca513e6d/241-Noria-al-Muhammadiyya.aspx\n|title=Noria al-Muhammadiyya\n|publisher=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers\n|author=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers\n|access-date=12 Feb 2017\n|date=December 2006\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Undershot wheel ===\n[[File:Undershot waterwheel simple.svg|thumb|150px|Undershot waterwheel showing headrace, tailrace, and water]]\n\nAn undershot wheel is a vertically mounted water wheel with a horizontal axle that is rotated by the water from a low weir striking the wheel in the bottom quarter. Most of the energy gain is from the movement of the water and comparatively little from the head. They are similar in operation and design to stream wheels.\n\nThe term undershot is sometimes used with related but different meanings:\n* all wheels where the water passes under the wheel<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/undershot\n|author=Collins English Dictionary\n|access-date=12 February 2017\n|title=undershot\n}}</ref>\n* wheels where the water enters in the bottom quarter.\n* wheels where paddles are placed into the flow of a stream. See stream above.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/undershot%20wheel\n|author=Merriam Webster\n|title=stream wheel\n}}</ref><ref name=\"PITLtypes\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.powerinthelandscape.co.uk/water/water_wheels.html\n|author=Power in the landscape\n|access-date=12 February 2017\n|title=Types of water wheels\n}}</ref>\n\nThis is the oldest type of vertical water wheel.\n\n=== Breastshot wheel ===\n[[File:Breastshot waterwheel simple.svg|thumb|150px|Breastshot waterwheel showing headrace, tailrace, and water]]\n\nThe word '''breastshot''' is used in a variety of ways. Some authors restrict the term to wheels where the water enters at about the 10 o\u2019clock position, others 9 o\u2019clock, and others for a range of heights.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In this article it is used for wheels where the water entry is significantly above the bottom and significantly below the top, typically the middle half.\n\nThey are characterised by:\n* buckets carefully shaped to minimise turbulence as water enters\n* buckets ventilated with holes in the side to allow air to escape as the water enters\n* a masonry \"apron\" closely conforming to the wheel face, which helps contain the water in the buckets as they progress downwards\n\nBoth [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] (movement) and [[potential energy|potential]] (height and weight) energy are utilised.\n\nThe small clearance between the wheel and the masonry requires that a breastshot wheel has a good [[trash rack]] ('screen' in British English) to prevent debris from jamming between the wheel and the apron and potentially causing serious damage.\n\nBreastshot wheels are less efficient than overshot and backshot wheels but they can handle high flow rates and consequently high power. They are preferred for steady, high-volume flows such as are found on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] of the North American East Coast. Breastshot wheels are the most common type in the United States of America{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and are said to have powered the industrial revolution.<ref name=\"ASMEnoria\"/>\n\n=== Overshot wheel ===\n[[File:Overshot waterwheel simple.svg|thumb|150px|Overshot waterwheel showing headrace, tailrace, water, and spillage]]\n\nA vertically mounted water wheel that is rotated by water entering buckets just past the top of the wheel is said to be overshot. The term is sometimes, erroneously, applied to backshot  wheels where the water goes down behind the wheel.\n\nA typical overshot wheel has the water channelled to the wheel at the top and slightly beyond the axle. The water collects in the buckets on that side of the wheel, making it heavier than the other \"empty\" side. The weight turns the wheel, and the water flows out into the tail-water when the wheel rotates enough to invert the buckets. The overshot design is very efficient, it can achieve 90%,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and does not require rapid flow.\n\nNearly all of the energy is gained from the weight of water lowered to the tail race although a small contribution may be made by the kinetic energy of the water entering the wheel. They are suited to larger heads than the other type of wheel so they are ideally suited to hilly country. However even the largest water wheel, the [[Laxey Wheel]] in the [[Isle of Man]], only utilises a head of around {{Convert|30|m||abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. The world's largest head turbines, [[Bieudron Hydroelectric Power Station]] in [[Switzerland]], utilise about {{Convert|1869|m||abbr=on}}.\n\nOvershot wheels require a large head compared to other types of wheel which usually means significant investment in constructing the head race. Sometimes the final approach of the water to the wheel is along a [[flume]] or [[penstock]], which can be lengthy.\n\n=== Backshot wheel ===\n[[File:Backshot waterwheel simple.svg|thumb|150px|Backshot waterwheel showing headrace, tailrace, water, and spillage]]\n\nA backshot wheel (also called '''pitchback''') is a variety of overshot wheel where the water is introduced just before the summit of the wheel. In many situations it has the advantage that the bottom of the wheel is moving in the same direction as the water in the tail race which makes it more efficient. It also performs better than an overshot wheel in flood conditions when the water level may submerge the bottom of the wheel. It will continue to rotate until the water in the wheel pit rises quite high on the wheel. This makes the technique particularly suitable for streams that experience significant variations in flow and reduces the size, complexity and hence cost of the tail race.\n\nThe direction of rotation of a backshot wheel is the same as that of a breastshot wheel but in other respects it is very similar to the overshot wheel. See below.\n\n=== Hybrid ===\n==== Overshot and backshot ====\n[[File:Finch Foundary Water Wheel, Devon, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|One of Finch Foundry's water wheels.]]\n\nSome wheels are overshot at the top and backshot at the bottom thereby potentially combining the best features of both types. The photograph shows an example at [[Finch Foundry]] in Devon, UK. The head race is the overhead timber structure and a branch to the left supplies water to the wheel. The water exits from under the wheel back into the stream.\n\n==== Reversible ====\n[[File:AndersonMill.jpg|thumb|The '''Anderson Mill''' of [[Anderson Mill, Texas|Texas]] is undershot, backshot, and overshot using two sources of water. This allows the direction of the wheel to be reversed.]]\n\nA special type of overshot/backshot wheel is the reversible water wheel. This has two sets of blades or buckets running in opposite directions, so that it can turn in either direction depending on which side the water is directed. Reversible wheels were used in the [[mining]] industry in order to power various means of ore conveyance. By changing the direction of the wheel, barrels or baskets of ore could be lifted up or lowered down a shaft or inclined plane. There was usually a cable drum or a chain basket (German: Kettenkorb) on the axle of the wheel. It is essential that the wheel have braking equipment to be able to stop the wheel (known as a braking wheel). The oldest known drawing of a reversible water wheel was by [[Georgius Agricola]] and dates to 1556.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Watermill|Noria}}\n\nAs in all machinery, rotary motion is more efficient in water-raising devices than oscilliating one.<ref name=\"Oleson 2000, 229\">{{harvnb|Oleson|2000|p=229}}</ref> In terms of power source, waterwheels can be turned by either human respectively animal force or by the water current itself. Waterwheels come in two basic designs, either equipped with a vertical or a horizontal axle. The latter type can be subdivided, depending on where the water hits the wheel paddles, into overshot, breastshot and undershot wheels. The two main functions of waterwheels were historically water-lifting for irrigation purposes and milling, particularly of grain. In case of horizontal-axle mills, a system of gears is required for power transmission, which vertical-axle mills do not need.\n\n=== Western world ===\n==== Greco-Roman world ====\n{{See also|List of ancient watermills}}\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] invented the waterwheel and were, along with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the first to use it in nearly all of the forms and functions described above, including its application for watermilling.<ref name=\"Oleson 1984, 325ff.\">{{harvnb|Oleson|1984|pp=325ff.}};

Many were found during modern mining at the [[copper]] mines at [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in [[Spain]], one system involving 16 such wheels stacked above one another so as to lift water about 80&nbsp;feet from the mine sump. Part of such a wheel was found at [[Dolaucothi]], a Roman [[gold mine]] in south [[Wales]] in the 1930s when the mine was briefly re-opened. It was found about 160&nbsp;feet below the surface, so must have been part of a similar sequence as that discovered at Rio Tinto.

[[Tide mill]]s became common in estuaries with a good tidal range in both Europe and America generally using undershot wheels.\n\n[[File:Waterwheel-Uzhhorod.jpg|thumb|upright|Water wheel powering a small village mill at the [[Museum of Folk Architecture and Life, Uzhhorod]], [[Ukraine]]]]\n\n[[Cistercian]] [[Monastery|monasteries]], in particular, made extensive use of water wheels to power watermills of many kinds. An early example of a very large water wheel is the still extant wheel at the early 13th century [[Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda]], a Cistercian monastery in the [[Aragon]] region of [[Spain]]. Grist mills (for corn) were undoubtedly the most common, but there were also sawmills, fulling mills and mills to fulfil many other labour-intensive tasks. The water wheel remained competitive with the [[steam engine]] well into the [[Industrial Revolution]]. At around the 8th to 10th century, a number of irrigation technologies were brought into Spain and thus introduced to Europe. One of those technologies is the Noria, which is basically a wheel fitted with buckets on the peripherals for lifting water. It is similar to the undershot water wheel mentioned later in this article. It allowed peasants to power watermills more efficiently. According to Thomas Glick's book, ''Irrigation and Society in Medieval Valencia'', the Noria probably originated from somewhere in [[Persia]]. It has been used for centuries before the technology was brought into Spain by Arabs who had adopted it from the Romans. Thus the distribution of the Noria in the Iberian peninsula \"conforms to the area of stabilized Islamic settlement\".<ref>Glick, p. 178</ref> This technology has a profound effect on the life of peasants. The Noria is relatively cheap to build. Thus it allowed peasants to cultivate land more efficiently in Europe. Together with the [[Spaniards]], the technology spread to the [[New World]] in [[Mexico]] and [[South America]] following [[Spanish Empire|Spanish expansion]]\n\n==== Domesday inventory of English mills c. 1086 ====\nThe assembly convened by [[William of Normandy]], commonly referred to as the \"[[Domesday]]\" or Doomsday survey, took an inventory of all potentially taxable property in England, which included over six thousand mills spread across three thousand different locations.<ref name=\"Friedel31\">Robert, Friedel, ''A Culture of Improvement''. MIT Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts. London, England. (2007). pp. 31-2b.</ref>\n\n==== Locations ====\nThe type of water wheel selected  was dependent upon the location. Generally if only small volumes of water and high waterfalls were available a millwright would choose to use an [[overshot wheel]]. The decision was influenced by the fact that the buckets could catch and use even a small volume of water.<ref name =\"Howard\">{{Cite journal |last=Howard |first=Robert A. |title=Primer on Water Wheels |journal=[[Bulletin of the Association for Preservation Technology]] |volume=15 |issue=3 |date=1983 |pages=26\u201333 |doi=10.2307/1493973 |jstor=1493973}}</ref> For large volumes of water with small waterfalls the undershot wheel would have been used, since it was more adapted to such conditions and cheaper to construct. So long as these water supplies were abundant the question of efficiency remained irrelevant.

Europe began to transit from human and animal muscle labor towards mechanical labor with the advent of the water wheel. Medievalist Lynn White Jr. contended that the spread of inanimate power sources was eloquent testimony to the emergence of the West of a new attitude toward, power, work, nature, and above all else technology.<ref name=\"Friedel31\"/>\n\nHarnessing water-power enabled gains in agricultural productivity, food surpluses and the large scale urbanization starting in the 11th century. The usefulness of water power motivated European experiments with other power sources, such as wind and tidal mills.<ref>Terry S, Reynolds, ''Stronger than a Hundred Men; A History of the Vertical Water Wheel''.

From [[Georg Agricola]]'s ''[[De re metallica]]'' (1556)]]\n\nThe water mill was used for grinding grain, producing flour for bread, malt for beer, or coarse meal for porridge.<ref>Robert, Friedel, A'' Culture of Improvement''. MIT Press. Cambridge, Massachusetts. London, England. (2007)</ref> Hammermills used the wheel to operate hammers. One type was [[fulling|fulling mill]], which was used for cloth making.  The [[trip hammer]] was also used for making [[wrought iron]] and for working iron into useful shapes, an activity that was otherwise labour-intensive. The water wheel was also used in [[papermaking]], beating material to a pulp. In the 13th century water mills used for hammering throughout Europe improved the productivity of early steel manufacturing. Along with the mastery of gunpowder, waterpower provided European countries worldwide military leadership from the 15th century.\n\n==== 17th- and 18th-century Europe ====\nMillwrights distinguished between the two forces, impulse and weight, at work in water wheels long before 18th-century Europe. Fitzherbert, a 16th-century agricultural writer, wrote \"druieth the wheel as well as with the weight of the water as with strengthe [impulse]\".<ref>[[Anthony Fitzherbert]], ''Surveying'' (London, 1539, reprinted in [Robert Vansitarrt, ed] ''Certain Ancient Tracts Concerning the Management of Landed Property'' Reprinted [London, 1767.] pg. 92.\n</ref> [[Leonardo da Vinci]] also discussed water power, noting \"the blow [of the water] is not weight, but excites a power of weight, almost equal to its own power\".<ref>Leonardo da Vinci, MS F, 44r, in ''Les manuscrits de Leonardo da Vinci'', ed Charles Ravaisson-Moilien (Paris, 1889), vol.4; cf, Codex Madrid, vol. 1, 69r [The Madrid Codices], trans. And transcribed by Ladislao Reti (New York, 1974), vol. 4.</ref> However, even realisation of the two forces, weight and impulse, confusion remained over the advantages and disadvantages of the two, and there was no clear understanding of the superior efficiency of weight.<ref>Smeaton, \"An Experiemental Inquiry Concerning the Natural Powers of Water and Wind to Turn Mills, and Other Machines, depending on Circular Motion,\" Royal Society, ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'' 51 (1759); 124-125</ref> Prior to 1750 it was unsure as to which force was dominant and was widely understood that both forces were operating with equal inspiration amongst one another.<ref name=\"Torricelli, Evangelista 1919\">Torricelli, Evangelista, ''Opere'', ed. Gino Loria and Giuseppe Vassura (Rome, 1919.)</ref> The waterwheel, sparked questions of the laws of nature, specifically the [[laws of force]]. [[Evangelista Torricelli]]'s work on water wheels used an analysis of Galileo's work on falling bodies, that the velocity of a water sprouting from an orifice under its [[Hydrostatic head|head]] was exactly equivalent to the velocity a drop of water acquired in falling freely from the same height.<ref name=\"Torricella, Evangelica 1919\">Torricella, Evangelica, ''Opere'', ed. Gino Loria and Giuseppe Vassura (Rome, 1919.)</ref>\n\n==== Industrial Europe ====\n[[File:Laxey Wheel (1715237934).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Laxey Wheel|Lady Isabella Wheel]], Laxey, Isle of Man, used to drive mine pumps]]\n\nThe most powerful water wheel built in the United Kingdom was the 100&nbsp;hp [[Quarry Bank Mill]] water wheel near Manchester. A high breastshot design, it was retired in 1904 and replaced with several turbines. It has now been restored and is a museum open to the public.\n\nThe biggest working water wheel in mainland Britain has a diameter of {{Convert|15.4|m||abbr=on}} and was built by the De Winton company of Caernarfon. It is located within the [[Dinorwic Quarry|Dinorwic workshops]] of the [[National Slate Museum|National Slate Museum in Llanberis]], North [[Wales]].\n\nThe largest working water wheel in the world is the [[Laxey Wheel]] (also known as ''Lady Isabella'') in the village of [[Laxey]],  [[Isle of Man]]. It is {{convert|72|ft|6|in|m|2}} in diameter and  {{convert|6|ft|m|2}} wide and is maintained by [[Manx National Heritage]].\n\nDevelopment of [[water turbine]]s during the [[Industrial Revolution]] led to decreased popularity of water wheels. The main advantage of turbines is that its ability to harness [[head (hydraulic)|head]] is much greater than the diameter of the turbine, whereas a water wheel cannot effectively harness head greater than its diameter. The migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one  hundred years.\n\n==== North America ====\n[[File:Portland Basin waterwheel- 5185.JPG|thumb|left|The suspension wheel with rim-gearing at the [[Dukinfield Junction|Portland Basin Canal Warehouse]]]]\n\nWater wheels were used to power sawmills, grist mills and for other purposes during development of the United States.  The {{convert|40|ft|m}} diameter [[Waterwheel (McCoy, Colorado)|water wheel at McCoy, Colorado]], built in 1922, is a surviving one out of many which lifted water for irrigation out of the [[Colorado River]].\n\nTwo early improvements were [[Wire wheel|suspension wheels]] and rim gearing. Suspension wheels are constructed in the same manner as a bicycle wheel, the rim being supported under tension from the hub- this led to larger lighter wheels than the former design where the heavy spokes were under compression. Rim-gearing entailed adding a notched wheel to the rim or shroud of the wheel. A stub gear engaged the rim-gear and took the power into the mill using an independent line shaft. This removed the rotative stress from the axle which could thus be lighter, and also allowed more flexibility in the location of the power train. The shaft rotation was geared up from that of the wheel which led to less power loss. An example of this design pioneered by Thomas Hewes and refined by [[William Fairburn]] can be seen at the 1849 restored wheel at the [[Dukinfield Junction|Portland Basin Canal Warehouse]].<ref>*{{Cite book\n  |first1=Mike |last1=Nevell\n  |last2=Walker\n  |year=2001\n  |title=Portland Basin and the archaeology of the Canal Warehouse\n  |publisher=Tameside Metropolitan Borough with [[Manchester University|University of Manchester Archaeological Unit]]\n  |isbn=978-1-871324-25-9\n  |ref=harv}}\n</ref>\n\nSomewhat related were [[fish wheel]]s used in the American Northwest and Alaska, which lifted -[[salmon]] out of the flow of rivers.\n\n=== China ===\n[[File:Tiangong Kaiwu Chain Pumps.jpg|thumb|upright|Two types of [[hydraulic]]-powered [[chain pump]]s from the ''[[Tiangong Kaiwu]]'' of 1637, written by the [[Ming Dynasty]] [[encyclopedist]], [[Song Yingxing]] (1587\u20131666).]]\nChinese water wheels almost certainly have a separate origin, as early ones there were invariably horizontal water wheels. By at least the 1st century&nbsp;AD, the [[China|Chinese]] of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] were using water wheels to crush grain in mills and to power the piston-[[bellows]] in forging [[iron ore]] into [[cast iron]].\n\nIn the text known as the ''Xin Lun'' written by [[Huan Tan]] about 20&nbsp;AD (during the usurpation of [[Wang Mang]]), it states that the legendary mythological king known as [[Fu Xi]] was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar, which evolved into the tilt-hammer and then trip hammer device (see [[trip hammer]]). Although the author speaks of the mythological Fu Xi, a passage of his writing gives hint that the water wheel was in widespread use by the 1st century&nbsp;AD in [[China]] ([[Wade-Giles]] spelling):\n\n<blockquote>\nFu Hsi invented the pestle and mortar, which is so useful, and later on it was cleverly improved in such a way that the whole weight of the body could be used for treading on the tilt-hammer (''tui''), thus increasing the efficiency ten times. Afterwards the power of animals\u2014donkeys, mules, oxen, and horses\u2014was applied by means of machinery, and water-power too used for pounding, so that the benefit was increased a hundredfold.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 392\">Needham, p. 392</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the year 31&nbsp;AD, the engineer and [[Prefect]] of [[Nanyang (region)|Nanyang]], [[Du Shi]] (d. 38), applied a complex use of the water wheel and machinery to power the [[bellows]] of the [[blast furnace]] to create [[cast iron]]. Du Shi is mentioned briefly in the ''[[Book of Later Han]]'' (''Hou Han Shu'') as follows (in Wade-Giles spelling):\n\n<blockquote>\nIn the seventh year of the Chien-Wu reign period (31&nbsp;AD) Tu Shih was posted to be Prefect of Nanyang. He was a generous man and his policies were peaceful; he destroyed evil-doers and established the dignity (of his office). Good at planning, he loved the common people and wished to save their labor. He invented a water-power reciprocator (''shui phai'') for the casting of (iron) agricultural implements. Those who smelted and cast already had the push-bellows to blow up their charcoal fires, and now they were instructed to use the rushing of the water (''chi shui'') to operate it&nbsp;... Thus the people got great benefit for little labor. They found the 'water(-powered) bellows' convenient and adopted it widely.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 370\">Needham, p. 370</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWater wheels in [[China]] found practical uses such as this, as well as extraordinary use. The [[List of Chinese inventions|Chinese inventor]] [[Zhang Heng]] (78\u2013139) was the first in history to apply motive power in rotating the astronomical instrument of an [[armillary sphere]], by use of a water wheel.<ref name=\"morton 70\">Morton, p. 70</ref> The [[mechanical engineer]] [[Ma Jun]] (c. 200\u2013265) from [[Cao Wei]] once used a water wheel to power and operate a large mechanical puppet theater for the [[Emperor Ming of Wei]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 226\u2013239).<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 158\">Needham, p. 158</ref>\n\n=== India ===\nThe early history of the watermill in [[History of India|India]] is obscure. Ancient Indian texts dating back to the 4th century BC refer to the term ''cakkavattaka'' (turning wheel), which commentaries explain as ''arahatta-ghati-yanta'' (machine with wheel-pots attached). On this basis, [[Joseph Needham]] suggested that the machine was a [[noria]]. Terry S. Reynolds, however, argues that the \"term used in Indian texts is ambiguous and does not clearly indicate a water-powered device.\" Thorkild Schi\u00f8ler argued that it is \"more likely that these passages refer to some type of tread- or hand-operated water-lifting device, instead of a water-powered water-lifting wheel.\"<ref>Reynolds, p. 14</ref>\n\nAccording to Greek historical tradition, India received water-mills from the Roman Empire in the early 4th century AD when a certain Metrodoros introduced \"water-mills and baths, unknown among them [the Brahmans] till then\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wikander|2000|p=400}}: {{quote|This is also the period when water-mills started to spread outside the former Empire.

In some situations an overshot wheel is preferable to a turbine.<ref>For a discussion of the different types of water wheels, see Syson, p. 76-91</ref>\n\nThe development of the [[water turbine|hydraulic turbine]] wheels with their improved efficiency (>67%) opened up an alternative path for the installation of water wheels in existing mills, or redevelopment of abandoned mills.\n\n== The power of a wheel ==\n<!--Some of the material in this section taken from [[water turbine]] with some modification and much extension -->\nThe energy available to the wheel has two components:\n*[[Kinetic energy]] \u2013 depends on how fast the water is moving when it enters the wheel\n*[[Potential energy]] \u2013 depends on the change in height of the water between entry to and exit from the wheel\n\nThe kinetic energy can be accounted for by converting it into an equivalent head, the velocity head, and adding it to the actual head. For still water the velocity head is zero, and to a good approximation it is negligible for slowly moving water, and can be ignored. The velocity in the tail race is not taken into account because for a perfect wheel the water would leave with zero energy which requires zero velocity. That is impossible, the water has to move away from the wheel, and represents an unavoidable cause of inefficiency.\n\nThe [[power (physics)|power]] is how fast that energy is delivered which is determined by the flow rate.\n\n=== Quantities and units ===\n\n*<math>\\eta=</math>    [[efficiency]]\n*<math>\\rho=</math>    [[density]] of [[water]] (1000&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3)\n*<math>A=</math>       [[cross sectional area]] of the channel (m\u00b2)\n*<math>D=</math>       [[diameter]] of wheel (m)\n*<math>P=</math>       [[power (physics)|power]] (W)\n*<math>d=</math>       [[distance]] (m)\n*<math>g=</math>       [[Gravity of Earth|strength of gravity]] (9.81&nbsp;m/s\u00b2 = 9.81&nbsp;N/kg)\n*<math>h=</math>       [[hydraulic head|head]] (m)\n*<math>h_p=</math>     [[pressure head]], the difference in water levels (m)\n*<math>h_v=</math>     [[velocity head]] (m)\n*<math>k=</math>       velocity correction factor. 0.9 for smooth channels.<ref name=\"USFS\"/>\n*<math>v=</math>       [[velocity]] (m/s)\n*<math>\\dot q =</math> [[Volumetric flow rate|volume flow rate]] (m\u00b3/s)\n*<math>t=</math>       [[Time in physics|time]] (s)\n{{ref|dotted|dotted notation}}\n\n=== Measurements ===\n[[File:HeadMeasurement.svg|thumb|How to measure the head and flow rate of a water wheel.]]\n\nPressure head <math>h_p=</math> is the difference in height between the head race and tail race water surfaces.\n\nVelocity head <math>h_v=</math> is calculated from the velocity of the water in the head race at the same place as the pressure head is measured from.\n\nThe velocity (speed) <math>v</math> can be measured by the pooh sticks method, timing a floating object over a measured distance.

A water wheel consists of a wheel (usually constructed from wood or metal), with a number of [[blade]]s or [[bucket]]s arranged on the outside rim forming the driving surface.\n\nWater wheels were still in commercial use well into the 20th century but they are no longer in common use. Uses included milling flour in [[gristmill]]s, grinding wood into pulp for [[papermaking]], hammering [[wrought iron]], machining, ore crushing and pounding fiber for use in the manufacture of [[cloth]].\n\nSome water wheels are fed by water from a mill pond, which is formed when a flowing stream is dammed. A channel for the water flowing to or from a water wheel is called a [[mill race]]. The race bringing water from the mill pond to the water wheel is a '''headrace'''; the one carrying water after it has left the wheel is commonly referred to as a '''tailrace'''.<ref name=\"Ref-1\">[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tailrace Dictionary definition of \"tailrace\"]</ref>\n\nIn the mid to late 18th century [[John Smeaton]]'s scientific investigation of the water wheel led to significant increases in efficiency supplying much needed power for the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref name=\"Robinson&Musson\">\n{{cite book\n|title=Science and Technology in the Industrial Revolution\n |url=https://archive.org/details/sciencetechnolog00aemu\n |url-access=registration\n |last=Musson\n|author2=Robinson\n |year=1969 |publisher =University of Toronto Press\n|location=\n|isbn= |page=[https://archive.org/details/sciencetechnolog00aemu/page/69 69]}}\n</ref><ref name=\"Thomson 2009\">{{cite book |title      = Structures of Change in the Mechanical Age: Technological Invention in the United States 1790-1865\n |last       = Thomson\n |first      = Ross\n |authorlink = \n |year       = 2009\n |publisher  = The Johns Hopkins University Press\n |location   = Baltimore, MD\n |isbn       = 978-0-8018-9141-0\n |page       = [https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom/page/34 34]\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/structuresofchan0000thom/page/34\n}}\n</ref>\n\nWater wheels began being displaced by the smaller, less expensive and more efficient [[turbine]], developed by [[Beno\u00eet Fourneyron]], beginning with his first model in 1827.<ref name=\"Thomson 2009\"/>  Turbines are capable of handling high ''[[Hydrostatic head|heads]]'', or [[elevation]]s, that exceed the capability of practical-sized waterwheels.\n\nThe main difficulty of water wheels is their dependence on flowing water, which limits where they can be located. Modern [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric dam]]s can be viewed as the descendants of the water wheel, as they too take advantage of the movement of water downhill.\n\n== Types ==\nWater wheels come in two basic designs:<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/211_fall2010.web.dir/Brooks/types-of-water-wheels.html|title=Types of Water Wheels \u2013 The Physics of a Water Wheel|website=ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-10}}</ref>\n* a horizontal wheel with a vertical axle; or\n* a vertical wheel with a horizontal axle.\nThe latter can be subdivided according to where the water hits the wheel into backshot (pitch-back<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/pitch-back]</ref>) overshot, breastshot, undershot, and stream-wheels.<ref name=\"Stream wheel term and specifics\">[http://www.energy.soton.ac.uk/hydro/waterwheels.html Stream wheel term and specifics]</ref><ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/undershot%20wheel Merriam Webster]</ref><ref>[http://www.powerinthelandscape.co.uk/water/water_wheels.html Power in the Landscape]</ref>\nThe term undershot can refer to any wheel where the water passes under the wheel<ref>[https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/undershot Collins English Dictionary]</ref> but it usually implies that the water entry is low on the wheel.\n\nOvershot and backshot water wheels are typically used where the available height difference is more than a couple of meters. Breastshot wheels are more suited to large flows with a moderate [[Hydrostatic head|head]]. Undershot and stream wheel use large flows at little or no head.\n\nThere is often an associated [[millpond]], a reservoir for storing water and hence energy until it is needed.

However, if it delivers the required power then the efficiency is of secondary importance. It is usually mounted inside a mill building below the working floor.

This type of water wheel is the oldest type of horizontal axis wheel.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} They are also known as [[free surface]] wheels because the water is not constrained by millraces or wheel pit. {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nStream wheels are cheaper and simpler to build, and have less of an environmental impact, than other type of wheel. They do not constitute a major change of the river. Their disadvantages are their low efficiency, which means that they generate less power and can only be used where the flow rate is sufficient. A typical flat board undershot wheel uses about 20 percent of the energy in the flow of water striking the wheel as measured by English civil engineer [[John Smeaton]] in the 18th century.<ref>The History of Science and Technology by Bryan Bunch with Alexander Hellmans pp.114</ref> More modern wheels have higher efficiencies.\n\nStream wheels gain little or no advantage from [[hydrostatic head|head]], a difference in water level.\n\nStream wheels mounted on floating platforms are often referred to as hip wheels and the mill as a [[ship mill]]. They were sometimes mounted immediately downstream from [[bridges]] where the flow restriction of the bridge piers increased the speed of the current.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nHistorically they were very inefficient but major advances were made in the eighteenth century.<ref name=\"ASMEnoria\">{{cite web\n|url=https://www.asme.org/getmedia/ac3c3ad4-4e16-46e3-b153-e586ca513e6d/241-Noria-al-Muhammadiyya.aspx\n|title=Noria al-Muhammadiyya\n|publisher=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers\n|author=The American Society of Mechanical Engineers\n|access-date=12 Feb 2017\n|date=December 2006\n}}</ref>\n\n=== Undershot wheel ===\n[[File:Undershot waterwheel simple.svg|thumb|150px|Undershot waterwheel showing headrace, tailrace, and water]]\n\nAn undershot wheel is a vertically mounted water wheel with a horizontal axle that is rotated by the water from a low weir striking the wheel in the bottom quarter. Most of the energy gain is from the movement of the water and comparatively little from the head. They are similar in operation and design to stream wheels.\n\nThe term undershot is sometimes used with related but different meanings:\n* all wheels where the water passes under the wheel<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/undershot\n|author=Collins English Dictionary\n|access-date=12 February 2017\n|title=undershot\n}}</ref>\n* wheels where the water enters in the bottom quarter.\n* wheels where paddles are placed into the flow of a stream. See stream above.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/undershot%20wheel\n|author=Merriam Webster\n|title=stream wheel\n}}</ref><ref name=\"PITLtypes\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.powerinthelandscape.co.uk/water/water_wheels.html\n|author=Power in the landscape\n|access-date=12 February 2017\n|title=Types of water wheels\n}}</ref>\n\nThis is the oldest type of vertical water wheel.\n\n=== Breastshot wheel ===\n[[File:Breastshot waterwheel simple.svg|thumb|150px|Breastshot waterwheel showing headrace, tailrace, and water]]\n\nThe word '''breastshot''' is used in a variety of ways. Some authors restrict the term to wheels where the water enters at about the 10 o\u2019clock position, others 9 o\u2019clock, and others for a range of heights.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In this article it is used for wheels where the water entry is significantly above the bottom and significantly below the top, typically the middle half.\n\nThey are characterised by:\n* buckets carefully shaped to minimise turbulence as water enters\n* buckets ventilated with holes in the side to allow air to escape as the water enters\n* a masonry \"apron\" closely conforming to the wheel face, which helps contain the water in the buckets as they progress downwards\n\nBoth [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] (movement) and [[potential energy|potential]] (height and weight) energy are utilised.\n\nThe small clearance between the wheel and the masonry requires that a breastshot wheel has a good [[trash rack]] ('screen' in British English) to prevent debris from jamming between the wheel and the apron and potentially causing serious damage.\n\nBreastshot wheels are less efficient than overshot and backshot wheels but they can handle high flow rates and consequently high power. They are preferred for steady, high-volume flows such as are found on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] of the North American East Coast. Breastshot wheels are the most common type in the United States of America{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and are said to have powered the industrial revolution.<ref name=\"ASMEnoria\"/>\n\n=== Overshot wheel ===\n[[File:Overshot waterwheel simple.svg|thumb|150px|Overshot waterwheel showing headrace, tailrace, water, and spillage]]\n\nA vertically mounted water wheel that is rotated by water entering buckets just past the top of the wheel is said to be overshot. The term is sometimes, erroneously, applied to backshot  wheels where the water goes down behind the wheel.\n\nA typical overshot wheel has the water channelled to the wheel at the top and slightly beyond the axle. The water collects in the buckets on that side of the wheel, making it heavier than the other \"empty\" side. The weight turns the wheel, and the water flows out into the tail-water when the wheel rotates enough to invert the buckets. The overshot design is very efficient, it can achieve 90%,{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} and does not require rapid flow.\n\nNearly all of the energy is gained from the weight of water lowered to the tail race although a small contribution may be made by the kinetic energy of the water entering the wheel. They are suited to larger heads than the other type of wheel so they are ideally suited to hilly country. However even the largest water wheel, the [[Laxey Wheel]] in the [[Isle of Man]], only utilises a head of around {{Convert|30|m||abbr=on|sigfig=1}}. The world's largest head turbines, [[Bieudron Hydroelectric Power Station]] in [[Switzerland]], utilise about {{Convert|1869|m||abbr=on}}.\n\nOvershot wheels require a large head compared to other types of wheel which usually means significant investment in constructing the head race. Sometimes the final approach of the water to the wheel is along a [[flume]] or [[penstock]], which can be lengthy.\n\n=== Backshot wheel ===\n[[File:Backshot waterwheel simple.svg|thumb|150px|Backshot waterwheel showing headrace, tailrace, water, and spillage]]\n\nA backshot wheel (also called '''pitchback''') is a variety of overshot wheel where the water is introduced just before the summit of the wheel. In many situations it has the advantage that the bottom of the wheel is moving in the same direction as the water in the tail race which makes it more efficient. It also performs better than an overshot wheel in flood conditions when the water level may submerge the bottom of the wheel. It will continue to rotate until the water in the wheel pit rises quite high on the wheel. This makes the technique particularly suitable for streams that experience significant variations in flow and reduces the size, complexity and hence cost of the tail race.\n\nThe direction of rotation of a backshot wheel is the same as that of a breastshot wheel but in other respects it is very similar to the overshot wheel. See below.\n\n=== Hybrid ===\n==== Overshot and backshot ====\n[[File:Finch Foundary Water Wheel, Devon, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|One of Finch Foundry's water wheels.]]\n\nSome wheels are overshot at the top and backshot at the bottom thereby potentially combining the best features of both types. The photograph shows an example at [[Finch Foundry]] in Devon, UK. The head race is the overhead timber structure and a branch to the left supplies water to the wheel. The water exits from under the wheel back into the stream.\n\n==== Reversible ====\n[[File:AndersonMill.jpg|thumb|The '''Anderson Mill''' of [[Anderson Mill, Texas|Texas]] is undershot, backshot, and overshot using two sources of water. This allows the direction of the wheel to be reversed.]]\n\nA special type of overshot/backshot wheel is the reversible water wheel. This has two sets of blades or buckets running in opposite directions, so that it can turn in either direction depending on which side the water is directed. Reversible wheels were used in the [[mining]] industry in order to power various means of ore conveyance. By changing the direction of the wheel, barrels or baskets of ore could be lifted up or lowered down a shaft or inclined plane. There was usually a cable drum or a chain basket (German: Kettenkorb) on the axle of the wheel. It is essential that the wheel have braking equipment to be able to stop the wheel (known as a braking wheel). The oldest known drawing of a reversible water wheel was by [[Georgius Agricola]] and dates to 1556.\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Watermill|Noria}}\n\nAs in all machinery, rotary motion is more efficient in water-raising devices than oscilliating one.<ref name=\"Oleson 2000, 229\">{{harvnb|Oleson|2000|p=229}}</ref> In terms of power source, waterwheels can be turned by either human respectively animal force or by the water current itself. Waterwheels come in two basic designs, either equipped with a vertical or a horizontal axle. The latter type can be subdivided, depending on where the water hits the wheel paddles, into overshot, breastshot and undershot wheels. The two main functions of waterwheels were historically water-lifting for irrigation purposes and milling, particularly of grain. In case of horizontal-axle mills, a system of gears is required for power transmission, which vertical-axle mills do not need.\n\n=== Western world ===\n==== Greco-Roman world ====\n{{See also|List of ancient watermills}}\n\nThe [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] invented the waterwheel and were, along with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the first to use it in nearly all of the forms and functions described above, including its application for watermilling.<ref name=\"Oleson 1984, 325ff.\">{{harvnb|Oleson|1984|pp=325ff.}};

Many were found during modern mining at the [[copper]] mines at [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in [[Spain]], one system involving 16 such wheels stacked above one another so as to lift water about 80&nbsp;feet from the mine sump. Part of such a wheel was found at [[Dolaucothi]], a Roman [[gold mine]] in south [[Wales]] in the 1930s when the mine was briefly re-opened. It was found about 160&nbsp;feet below the surface, so must have been part of a similar sequence as that discovered at Rio Tinto. It has recently been [[carbon dated]] to about 90 AD, and since the wood from which it was made is much older than the deep mine, it is likely that the deep workings were in operation perhaps 30\u201350&nbsp;years after. It is clear from these examples of drainage wheels found in sealed underground galleries in widely separated locations that building water wheels was well within their capabilities, and such verticals water wheels commonly used for industrial purposes.\n\n;Watermilling\n[[File:Roda de Vitruvi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Vitruvius]]' undershot-wheeled watermill (reconstruction)]]\n\nTaking indirect evidence into account from the work of the Greek technician [[Apollonius of Perge]], the British historian of technology M.J.T.

An early example of a very large water wheel is the still extant wheel at the early 13th century [[Real Monasterio de Nuestra Senora de Rueda]], a Cistercian monastery in the [[Aragon]] region of [[Spain]]. Grist mills (for corn) were undoubtedly the most common, but there were also sawmills, fulling mills and mills to fulfil many other labour-intensive tasks. The water wheel remained competitive with the [[steam engine]] well into the [[Industrial Revolution]]. At around the 8th to 10th century, a number of irrigation technologies were brought into Spain and thus introduced to Europe. One of those technologies is the Noria, which is basically a wheel fitted with buckets on the peripherals for lifting water. It is similar to the undershot water wheel mentioned later in this article. It allowed peasants to power watermills more efficiently. According to Thomas Glick's book, ''Irrigation and Society in Medieval Valencia'', the Noria probably originated from somewhere in [[Persia]]. It has been used for centuries before the technology was brought into Spain by Arabs who had adopted it from the Romans. Thus the distribution of the Noria in the Iberian peninsula \"conforms to the area of stabilized Islamic settlement\".<ref>Glick, p. 178</ref> This technology has a profound effect on the life of peasants. The Noria is relatively cheap to build. Thus it allowed peasants to cultivate land more efficiently in Europe.

And transcribed by Ladislao Reti (New York, 1974), vol. 4.</ref> However, even realisation of the two forces, weight and impulse, confusion remained over the advantages and disadvantages of the two, and there was no clear understanding of the superior efficiency of weight.<ref>Smeaton, \"An Experiemental Inquiry Concerning the Natural Powers of Water and Wind to Turn Mills, and Other Machines, depending on Circular Motion,\" Royal Society, ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'' 51 (1759); 124-125</ref> Prior to 1750 it was unsure as to which force was dominant and was widely understood that both forces were operating with equal inspiration amongst one another.<ref name=\"Torricelli, Evangelista 1919\">Torricelli, Evangelista, ''Opere'', ed. Gino Loria and Giuseppe Vassura (Rome, 1919.)</ref> The waterwheel, sparked questions of the laws of nature, specifically the [[laws of force]]. [[Evangelista Torricelli]]'s work on water wheels used an analysis of Galileo's work on falling bodies, that the velocity of a water sprouting from an orifice under its [[Hydrostatic head|head]] was exactly equivalent to the velocity a drop of water acquired in falling freely from the same height.<ref name=\"Torricella, Evangelica 1919\">Torricella, Evangelica, ''Opere'', ed. Gino Loria and Giuseppe Vassura (Rome, 1919.)</ref>\n\n==== Industrial Europe ====\n[[File:Laxey Wheel (1715237934).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Laxey Wheel|Lady Isabella Wheel]], Laxey, Isle of Man, used to drive mine pumps]]\n\nThe most powerful water wheel built in the United Kingdom was the 100&nbsp;hp [[Quarry Bank Mill]] water wheel near Manchester. A high breastshot design, it was retired in 1904 and replaced with several turbines. It has now been restored and is a museum open to the public.\n\nThe biggest working water wheel in mainland Britain has a diameter of {{Convert|15.4|m||abbr=on}} and was built by the De Winton company of Caernarfon. It is located within the [[Dinorwic Quarry|Dinorwic workshops]] of the [[National Slate Museum|National Slate Museum in Llanberis]], North [[Wales]].\n\nThe largest working water wheel in the world is the [[Laxey Wheel]] (also known as ''Lady Isabella'') in the village of [[Laxey]],  [[Isle of Man]]. It is {{convert|72|ft|6|in|m|2}} in diameter and  {{convert|6|ft|m|2}} wide and is maintained by [[Manx National Heritage]].\n\nDevelopment of [[water turbine]]s during the [[Industrial Revolution]] led to decreased popularity of water wheels. The main advantage of turbines is that its ability to harness [[head (hydraulic)|head]] is much greater than the diameter of the turbine, whereas a water wheel cannot effectively harness head greater than its diameter. The migration from water wheels to modern turbines took about one  hundred years.\n\n==== North America ====\n[[File:Portland Basin waterwheel- 5185.JPG|thumb|left|The suspension wheel with rim-gearing at the [[Dukinfield Junction|Portland Basin Canal Warehouse]]]]\n\nWater wheels were used to power sawmills, grist mills and for other purposes during development of the United States.  The {{convert|40|ft|m}} diameter [[Waterwheel (McCoy, Colorado)|water wheel at McCoy, Colorado]], built in 1922, is a surviving one out of many which lifted water for irrigation out of the [[Colorado River]].\n\nTwo early improvements were [[Wire wheel|suspension wheels]] and rim gearing. Suspension wheels are constructed in the same manner as a bicycle wheel, the rim being supported under tension from the hub- this led to larger lighter wheels than the former design where the heavy spokes were under compression. Rim-gearing entailed adding a notched wheel to the rim or shroud of the wheel. A stub gear engaged the rim-gear and took the power into the mill using an independent line shaft. This removed the rotative stress from the axle which could thus be lighter, and also allowed more flexibility in the location of the power train. The shaft rotation was geared up from that of the wheel which led to less power loss. An example of this design pioneered by Thomas Hewes and refined by [[William Fairburn]] can be seen at the 1849 restored wheel at the [[Dukinfield Junction|Portland Basin Canal Warehouse]].<ref>*{{Cite book\n  |first1=Mike |last1=Nevell\n  |last2=Walker\n  |year=2001\n  |title=Portland Basin and the archaeology of the Canal Warehouse\n  |publisher=Tameside Metropolitan Borough with [[Manchester University|University of Manchester Archaeological Unit]]\n  |isbn=978-1-871324-25-9\n  |ref=harv}}\n</ref>\n\nSomewhat related were [[fish wheel]]s used in the American Northwest and Alaska, which lifted -[[salmon]] out of the flow of rivers.\n\n=== China ===\n[[File:Tiangong Kaiwu Chain Pumps.jpg|thumb|upright|Two types of [[hydraulic]]-powered [[chain pump]]s from the ''[[Tiangong Kaiwu]]'' of 1637, written by the [[Ming Dynasty]] [[encyclopedist]], [[Song Yingxing]] (1587\u20131666).]]\nChinese water wheels almost certainly have a separate origin, as early ones there were invariably horizontal water wheels. By at least the 1st century&nbsp;AD, the [[China|Chinese]] of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] were using water wheels to crush grain in mills and to power the piston-[[bellows]] in forging [[iron ore]] into [[cast iron]].\n\nIn the text known as the ''Xin Lun'' written by [[Huan Tan]] about 20&nbsp;AD (during the usurpation of [[Wang Mang]]), it states that the legendary mythological king known as [[Fu Xi]] was the one responsible for the pestle and mortar, which evolved into the tilt-hammer and then trip hammer device (see [[trip hammer]]). Although the author speaks of the mythological Fu Xi, a passage of his writing gives hint that the water wheel was in widespread use by the 1st century&nbsp;AD in [[China]] ([[Wade-Giles]] spelling):\n\n<blockquote>\nFu Hsi invented the pestle and mortar, which is so useful, and later on it was cleverly improved in such a way that the whole weight of the body could be used for treading on the tilt-hammer (''tui''), thus increasing the efficiency ten times. Afterwards the power of animals\u2014donkeys, mules, oxen, and horses\u2014was applied by means of machinery, and water-power too used for pounding, so that the benefit was increased a hundredfold.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 392\">Needham, p. 392</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn the year 31&nbsp;AD, the engineer and [[Prefect]] of [[Nanyang (region)|Nanyang]], [[Du Shi]] (d. 38), applied a complex use of the water wheel and machinery to power the [[bellows]] of the [[blast furnace]] to create [[cast iron]]. Du Shi is mentioned briefly in the ''[[Book of Later Han]]'' (''Hou Han Shu'') as follows (in Wade-Giles spelling):\n\n<blockquote>\nIn the seventh year of the Chien-Wu reign period (31&nbsp;AD) Tu Shih was posted to be Prefect of Nanyang. He was a generous man and his policies were peaceful; he destroyed evil-doers and established the dignity (of his office). Good at planning, he loved the common people and wished to save their labor. He invented a water-power reciprocator (''shui phai'') for the casting of (iron) agricultural implements. Those who smelted and cast already had the push-bellows to blow up their charcoal fires, and now they were instructed to use the rushing of the water (''chi shui'') to operate it&nbsp;... Thus the people got great benefit for little labor. They found the 'water(-powered) bellows' convenient and adopted it widely.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 370\">Needham, p. 370</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nWater wheels in [[China]] found practical uses such as this, as well as extraordinary use. The [[List of Chinese inventions|Chinese inventor]] [[Zhang Heng]] (78\u2013139) was the first in history to apply motive power in rotating the astronomical instrument of an [[armillary sphere]], by use of a water wheel.<ref name=\"morton 70\">Morton, p. 70</ref> The [[mechanical engineer]] [[Ma Jun]] (c. 200\u2013265) from [[Cao Wei]] once used a water wheel to power and operate a large mechanical puppet theater for the [[Emperor Ming of Wei]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 226\u2013239).<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 2 158\">Needham, p. 158</ref>\n\n=== India ===\nThe early history of the watermill in [[History of India|India]] is obscure. Ancient Indian texts dating back to the 4th century BC refer to the term ''cakkavattaka'' (turning wheel), which commentaries explain as ''arahatta-ghati-yanta'' (machine with wheel-pots attached). On this basis, [[Joseph Needham]] suggested that the machine was a [[noria]]. Terry S. Reynolds, however, argues that the \"term used in Indian texts is ambiguous and does not clearly indicate a water-powered device.\" Thorkild Schi\u00f8ler argued that it is \"more likely that these passages refer to some type of tread- or hand-operated water-lifting device, instead of a water-powered water-lifting wheel.\"<ref>Reynolds, p. 14</ref>\n\nAccording to Greek historical tradition, India received water-mills from the Roman Empire in the early 4th century AD when a certain Metrodoros introduced \"water-mills and baths, unknown among them [the Brahmans] till then\".<ref>{{harvnb|Wikander|2000|p=400}}: {{quote|This is also the period when water-mills started to spread outside the former Empire.

A.D. 325 \"constructed water-mills and baths, unknown among them [the Brahmans] till then\".}}</ref> Irrigation water for crops was provided by using water raising wheels, some driven by the force of the current in the river from which the water was being raised. This kind of water raising device was used in [[History of India|ancient India]], predating, according to Pacey, its use in the later Roman Empire or China,<ref>Pacey, p. 10</ref> even though the first literary, archaeological and pictorial evidence of the water wheel appeared in the Hellenistic world.<ref name=\"Oleson 1984, 325ff.\"/>\n\nAround 1150, the astronomer [[Bhaskara II|Bhaskara Ach\u0101rya]] observed water-raising wheels and imagined such a wheel lifting enough water to replenish the stream driving it, effectively, a [[perpetual motion]] machine.<ref>Pacey, p. 36</ref> The construction of water works and aspects of water technology in India is described in [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] works. During medieval times, the diffusion of Indian and Persian irrigation technologies gave rise to an advanced irrigation system which bought about economic growth and also helped in the growth of material culture.<ref>Siddiqui</ref>\n\n=== Islamic world ===\n{{See also|Muslim Agricultural Revolution}}\n[[File:Hama-3 norias.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The [[norias of Hama]] on the [[Orontes River]]]]\n\nArab engineers took over the water technology of the hydraulic societies of the ancient Near East; they adopted the water wheel as early as the 7th century, excavation of a canal in the Basra region discovered remains of a water wheel dating from this period. [[Hama]] in [[Syria]] still preserves [[Norias of Hama|some of its large wheels]], on the river [[Orontes river|Orontes]], although they are no longer in use.<ref>al-Hassani ''et al.'', p.115</ref>  One of the largest had a diameter of about {{Convert|20|m||abbr=}} and its rim was divided into 120 compartments. Another wheel that is still in operation is found at [[Murcia]] in [[Spain]], La Nora, and although the original wheel has been replaced by a steel one, the [[Moors|Moorish]] system during [[al-Andalus]] is otherwise virtually unchanged. Some medieval Islamic compartmented water wheels could lift water as high as {{Convert|30|m||abbr=|sigfig=1}}.<ref>{{citation|first=Adam|last=Lucas|year=2006|title=Wind, Water, Work: Ancient and Medieval Milling Technology|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|isbn=978-90-04-14649-5|page=26}}</ref> [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]]'s ''Kitab al-Hawi'' in the 10th century described a [[noria]] in Iraq that could lift as much as {{Convert|153,000|l/h|impgal/h|abbr=}}, or {{Convert|2550|l/min|impgal/min|abbr=}}.

A variety of industrial watermills were used in the Islamic world, including [[gristmill]]s, [[huller]]s, [[sawmill]]s, shipmills, [[stamp mill]]s, [[steel mill]]s, [[Sugar refinery|sugar mills]], and [[tide mill]]s. By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial watermills in operation, from [[al-Andalus]] and [[North Africa]] to the [[Middle East]] and [[Central Asia]].<ref>Lucas, p. 10</ref> Muslim and Christian engineers also used [[crankshaft]]s and [[water turbine]]s, [[gear]]s in watermills and water-raising [[machine]]s, and  [[dam]]s as a source of water, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines.<ref>Ahmad Y Hassan, [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Articles/articles%2071.htm Transfer Of Islamic Technology To The West, Part II: Transmission Of Islamic Engineering]</ref> Fulling mills and steel mills may have spread from Islamic Spain to Christian Spain in the 12th century. Industrial water mills were also employed in large [[factory]] complexes built in [[al-Andalus]] between the 11th and 13th centuries.<ref>Lucas, p.11</ref>\n\nThe engineers of the Islamic world developed several solutions to achieve the maximum output from a water wheel. One solution was to mount them to [[pier]]s of [[bridge]]s to take advantage of the increased flow. Another solution was the shipmill, a type of [[water mill]] powered by water wheels mounted on the sides of [[ship]]s [[Mooring (watercraft)|moored]] in midstream. This technique was employed along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers in 10th-century [[Iraq]], where large shipmills made of [[teak]] and [[iron]] could produce 10 [[ton]]s of [[Gristmill|flour from corn]] every day for the [[granary]] in [[Baghdad]].<ref name=Hill2>Hill; see also [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering])</ref> The [[flywheel]] mechanism, which is used to smooth out the delivery of power from a driving device to a driven machine, was invented by Ibn Bassal ([[floruit|fl.]] 1038-1075) of [[Al-Andalus]]; he pioneered the use of the flywheel in the [[Sakia|saqiya]] ([[chain pump]]) and noria.<ref>[[Ahmad Y Hassan]], [http://www.history-science-technology.com/Notes/Notes%204.htm Flywheel Effect for a ''Saqiya''].</ref> The engineers [[Al-Jazari]] in the 13th century and [[Taqi al-Din Muhammad ibn Ma'ruf|Taqi al-Din]] in the 16th century described many inventive water-raising machines in their technological treatises. They also employed water wheels to power a variety of devices, including various [[water clock]]s and [[Automaton|automata]].\n\n=== Modern developments ===\n==== Hydraulic wheel ====\nA recent development of the breastshot wheel is a hydraulic wheel which effectively incorporates automatic regulation systems. The Aqualienne is one example. It generates between 37&nbsp;kW and 200&nbsp;kW of electricity from a {{Convert|20|m3||abbr=on}} waterflow with a head of {{Convert|1 to 3.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=aqualienne>http://www.h3eindustries.com/How-does-an-Aqualienne%C2%AE-work? Aqualienne breastshot wheel</ref> It is designed to produce electricity at the sites of former watermills.\n\n== Efficiency ==\nOvershot (and particularly backshot) wheels are the most efficient type; a backshot [[steel]] wheel can be more efficient (about 60%) than all but the most advanced and well-constructed [[water turbine|turbines]]. In some situations an overshot wheel is preferable to a turbine.<ref>For a discussion of the different types of water wheels, see Syson, p. 76-91</ref>\n\nThe development of the [[water turbine|hydraulic turbine]] wheels with their improved efficiency (>67%) opened up an alternative path for the installation of water wheels in existing mills, or redevelopment of abandoned mills.\n\n== The power of a wheel ==\n<!--Some of the material in this section taken from [[water turbine]] with some modification and much extension -->\nThe energy available to the wheel has two components:\n*[[Kinetic energy]] \u2013 depends on how fast the water is moving when it enters the wheel\n*[[Potential energy]] \u2013 depends on the change in height of the water between entry to and exit from the wheel\n\nThe kinetic energy can be accounted for by converting it into an equivalent head, the velocity head, and adding it to the actual head. For still water the velocity head is zero, and to a good approximation it is negligible for slowly moving water, and can be ignored. The velocity in the tail race is not taken into account because for a perfect wheel the water would leave with zero energy which requires zero velocity. That is impossible, the water has to move away from the wheel, and represents an unavoidable cause of inefficiency.\n\nThe [[power (physics)|power]] is how fast that energy is delivered which is determined by the flow rate.\n\n=== Quantities and units ===\n\n*<math>\\eta=</math>    [[efficiency]]\n*<math>\\rho=</math>    [[density]] of [[water]] (1000&nbsp;kg/m\u00b3)\n*<math>A=</math>       [[cross sectional area]] of the channel (m\u00b2)\n*<math>D=</math>       [[diameter]] of wheel (m)\n*<math>P=</math>       [[power (physics)|power]] (W)\n*<math>d=</math>       [[distance]] (m)\n*<math>g=</math>       [[Gravity of Earth|strength of gravity]] (9.81&nbsp;m/s\u00b2 = 9.81&nbsp;N/kg)\n*<math>h=</math>       [[hydraulic head|head]] (m)\n*<math>h_p=</math>     [[pressure head]], the difference in water levels (m)\n*<math>h_v=</math>     [[velocity head]] (m)\n*<math>k=</math>       velocity correction factor. 0.9 for smooth channels.<ref name=\"USFS\"/>\n*<math>v=</math>       [[velocity]] (m/s)\n*<math>\\dot q =</math> [[Volumetric flow rate|volume flow rate]] (m\u00b3/s)\n*<math>t=</math>       [[Time in physics|time]] (s)\n{{ref|dotted|dotted notation}}\n\n=== Measurements ===\n[[File:HeadMeasurement.svg|thumb|How to measure the head and flow rate of a water wheel.]]\n\nPressure head <math>h_p=</math> is the difference in height between the head race and tail race water surfaces.\n\nVelocity head <math>h_v=</math> is calculated from the velocity of the water in the head race at the same place as the pressure head is measured from.\n\nThe velocity (speed) <math>v</math> can be measured by the pooh sticks method, timing a floating object over a measured distance.

The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the Chateau d'Hennemont to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of Ren\u00e9 Tallard. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 French children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, Ren\u00e9 Tallard, retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected Ren\u00e9 Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in Belgium, and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, Edgar Scherer. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, Jean-Pierre Maillard, had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to Patrick Charpeil, who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\nYves Lemaire took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts. France Bessis became proviseur of the school in 2019. \n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French Education National teachers teach subjects to French national standards and the school's foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s fourteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):\n\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Six hours in the middles school, including four hours of literature/language and two hours of history\n*Eight hours in the upper school, usually divided into four hours of literature/language and four hours of history/geography**\n\n(**American Section students have five hours of literature/language and three hours of history/geography, as do Polish Section students. Japanese Section students have six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography. Chinese section students take math courses during section time instead of history.)\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nLyc\u00e9e International students must take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills.\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye fluctuate between 99% and 100%, and an honors (''mention'') rate which is above 90%. These figures are used to compile rankings by national news outlets. While each news outlet has its own ranking system, in all the Lyc\u00e9e International consistently figures among the top ten in France. \n\nClassement des lyc\u00e9es 2019:\n\n* [https://classement-lycees.etudiant.lefigaro.fr Le Figaro]\n* [https://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-lycees.html L'Etudiant]\n* [https://www.lexpress.fr/palmares/lycees/ L'Express]\n* [http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/annuaire-lycees/classement/lycees-gt.html Le Parisien]\n* [http://www.linternaute.com/ville/lycee/lycee-international/etablissement-0783549J L'Internaute]\n\n\nEvery year many Lyc\u00e9e International students present the prestigious [[Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral]].

Students are taught the relevant national curriculum alongside the standard French curriculum. Foreign teachers in each of the national sections give the students lessons in literature, geography and history (from six to eight hours a week according to the grade) in their native tongue. All other disciplines of the official program are taught in French, by French Ministry of Education teachers.\n\n*[https://www.americansection.org American Section] Est. 1952, approx. 700 students\n:There are some 700 students enrolled in the American Section, at three different campuses, ranging from Pre-K (''MS'') through twelfth grade (''Terminale''). Over 50 nationalities are represented in the American Section student body, though the majority of our students hold both French and American nationalities or are French citizens who spent considerable time abroad in English language schools. The common denominator is that all American Section students speak age-appropriate fluent English and are motivated to learn in a demanding bilingual and bicultural environment.\n:The American Section provides an American educational and cultural experience, allowing students to maintain strong links with their American culture while developing a consciousness as global citizens. It pursues its mission through an American curriculum which culminates in the French Baccalaureate with International Option, as well as through a broad and enriching co-curricular program including such activities as drama, music, community service, sports and student publications.\n:The Ecole Schnapper and the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby, also located in St. Germain en Laye, are American Section partner schools. Approximately 65 students in grades K-5 (CP-CM2) attend the Ecole Schnapper, and 160 students in grades 6-9 (6\u00e8me-3\u00e8me) the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby.

The SHAPE Village Project was built in the grounds of the Chateau d'Hennemont to accommodate 1,500 officers and soldiers from 13 nationalities, and their families. SHAPE Supreme Commander General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] decided to create a school for the children of the officers, which he hoped would help SHAPE's multi-national families to live and work together in harmony.\n\nThe SHAPE village school opened in January 1952, under the direction of Ren\u00e9 Tallard. By the end of the school year, 400 children were on the register, including 200 French children, half of them inhabitants of the town. Two years later, in 1954, the school was officially renamed the NATO International School (l\u2019Ecole Internationale de l\u2019OTAN).\n\nFunding from SHAPE provided the school with equipment and accommodation, including a new flagship building completed in 1960. From 1961, senior students prepared for the Dipl\u00f4me des Ecoles Internationales and the following year, the school was renamed the [[NATO]] International Lyc\u00e9e (Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN). The founding proviseur, Ren\u00e9 Tallard, retired in 1965.\n\n===1965\u20131989===\n\nNot only did 1965 mark the retirement of the much respected Ren\u00e9 Tallard, it was also the year in which President de Gaulle decided to pull France out of NATO\u2019s military operations. NATO, and SHAPE, were forced to find a new European base, in Belgium, and the Lyc\u00e9e International de l\u2019OTAN lost two thirds of its pupils at a stroke. It was an immediate challenge for the new proviseur, Edgar Scherer. His was the delicate task of working with the remaining two public sections \u2013 the German and the Dutch \u2013 to persuade the educational authorities, both in France and overseas, to rebuild the life of the school which, would from now on need to count on the support of \"economic expatriates\" to replace those of the original military community. \n\nBy 1968, under Scherer\u2019s leadership and direction, the school was building up strength with six sections \u2013 German, Dutch, British, American, Danish and Italian.\n\n===1989\u2013present===\n\nScherer\u2019s successor, Jean-Pierre Maillard, had a different challenge: modernising the infrastructure of a school, which had been expanding again over more than twenty years. Replacing pre-fabricated buildings with more lasting structures was now a priority.\n\nThanks to state funding, the result was a new campus, including a fine new primary building. Under Maillard, other projects advanced too: the development of the network of partner schools, the drafting of a \"projet d\u2019\u00e9tablissement\", the creation of the Japanese section in 1993; the embracing of the Option Internationale du Baccalaur\u00e9at as the final exam for senior Lyc\u00e9e students, and the renovation of the chateau.\n\nIn 1997, Maillard handed the baton on to Patrick Charpeil, who focused attention on the administrative complexities of the school, clarifying the legal basis of the Lyc\u00e9e and its component parts. Charpeil continued to oversee the restoration of the chateau and successfully liaised and lobbied with the supervising educational authorities to advance important projects concerning security, major improvements and maintenance.\n\nYves Lemaire took over the helm in September 2001 until September 2012. The challenges were as stimulating as ever: the final stages of renovation and the future use of the chateau; the pressure for increasing the number of classes at Lyc\u00e9e level; nationwide administration of the OIB; the creation of the Polish section at Coll\u00e8ge and Lyc\u00e9e level (in 2002/3) and the consolidation of the legal status of the school via a new decree.\n\nHis successor, Joel Bianco officially took office as the new proviseur in September 2012. He directed the lyc\u00e9e from 2012 to 2016, integrating the Chinese Section. Isabelle Negral was proviseur from 2016 to 2019. She oversaw a major renovation, which included the creation of new secondary buildings, a new preschool building, and a state-of-the art gymnasium, as well as the renovation of the Agora, which will host the CDI, the Maison des Lyc\u00e9ens, meeting rooms, and a center for the arts. France Bessis became proviseur of the school in 2019. \n\n\n== Academics ==\nThe curriculum at the Lyc\u00e9e International combines the French national curriculum with the curriculum of one of the national sections. French Education National teachers teach subjects to French national standards and the school's foreign teachers \u2013 employed in one of the system\u2019s fourteen national sections \u2013 are given the freedom and responsibility to teach literature, language and history to their own national standards. These additional classes in the national sections provide (on a weekly basis):\n\n*Six hours of language class in the primary school\n*Six hours in the middles school, including four hours of literature/language and two hours of history\n*Eight hours in the upper school, usually divided into four hours of literature/language and four hours of history/geography**\n\n(**American Section students have five hours of literature/language and three hours of history/geography, as do Polish Section students. Japanese Section students have six hours of literature/language and two hours of history/geography. Chinese section students take math courses during section time instead of history.)\n\nSince the French curriculum requires learning at least two foreign language, many students who graduate from the Lyc\u00e9e International are fluent in four languages.\n\nStudents who do not speak French are placed in a French immersion program called ''Fran\u00e7ais Sp\u00e9cial''. After one year, they are expected to be fluent in French and integrate the standard French curriculum along with the rest of the student population.\n\nLyc\u00e9e International students must take the international variation on the ''baccalaur\u00e9at'', called the OIB ([[Baccalaur\u00e9at#Variations on the general baccalaur\u00e9at|Option Internationale du baccalaur\u00e9at]]), in order to take advantage of their language skills.\nBaccalaureat results at the Lyc\u00e9e International de Saint Germain-en-Laye fluctuate between 99% and 100%, and an honors (''mention'') rate which is above 90%. These figures are used to compile rankings by national news outlets. While each news outlet has its own ranking system, in all the Lyc\u00e9e International consistently figures among the top ten in France. \n\nClassement des lyc\u00e9es 2019:\n\n* [https://classement-lycees.etudiant.lefigaro.fr Le Figaro]\n* [https://www.letudiant.fr/palmares/classement-lycees.html L'Etudiant]\n* [https://www.lexpress.fr/palmares/lycees/ L'Express]\n* [http://etudiant.aujourdhui.fr/etudiant/annuaire-lycees/classement/lycees-gt.html Le Parisien]\n* [http://www.linternaute.com/ville/lycee/lycee-international/etablissement-0783549J L'Internaute]\n\n\nEvery year many Lyc\u00e9e International students present the prestigious [[Concours g\u00e9n\u00e9ral|Concours G\u00e9n\u00e9ral]].

Students are taught the relevant national curriculum alongside the standard French curriculum. Foreign teachers in each of the national sections give the students lessons in literature, geography and history (from six to eight hours a week according to the grade) in their native tongue. All other disciplines of the official program are taught in French, by French Ministry of Education teachers.\n\n*[https://www.americansection.org American Section] Est. 1952, approx. 700 students\n:There are some 700 students enrolled in the American Section, at three different campuses, ranging from Pre-K (''MS'') through twelfth grade (''Terminale''). Over 50 nationalities are represented in the American Section student body, though the majority of our students hold both French and American nationalities or are French citizens who spent considerable time abroad in English language schools. The common denominator is that all American Section students speak age-appropriate fluent English and are motivated to learn in a demanding bilingual and bicultural environment.\n:The American Section provides an American educational and cultural experience, allowing students to maintain strong links with their American culture while developing a consciousness as global citizens. It pursues its mission through an American curriculum which culminates in the French Baccalaureate with International Option, as well as through a broad and enriching co-curricular program including such activities as drama, music, community service, sports and student publications.\n:The Ecole Schnapper and the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby, also located in St. Germain en Laye, are American Section partner schools. Approximately 65 students in grades K-5 (CP-CM2) attend the Ecole Schnapper, and 160 students in grades 6-9 (6\u00e8me-3\u00e8me) the Coll\u00e8ge Marcel Roby.

It was created by [[David Zucker (director)|David Zucker]], [[Jim Abrahams]], and [[Jerry Zucker]], and starred [[Leslie Nielsen]] as [[Frank Drebin]]. A [[Parody|spoof]] of [[police procedural]]s, the series featured [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker]]'s usual [[sight gag]]s, [[wordplay]] and [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequiturs]]. While a parody of many television shows and movies, it bore a particular resemblance to the [[Lee Marvin]] cop show, ''[[M Squad]]'' (especially the opening credits) and the late 1960s series ''[[Felony Squad]]''.<ref>The creators stated this in a featurette for ''[[The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear]].''</ref> Although the show was canceled after six episodes, it later successfully spawned [[The Naked Gun|''The Naked Gun'' film series]] from 1988 to 1994. In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it #7 on their list of 60 shows that were \"Cancelled Too Soon\".<ref>Roush, Matt (June 3, 2013). \"Cancelled Too Soon\". ''[[TV Guide]]''. pp. 20 and 21</ref>\n\n==Overview==\n''Police Squad!'' was created by [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker]], who had all previously worked together on ''[[The Kentucky Fried Movie]]'' and ''[[Airplane!]]''. Despite critical acclaim, the show was canceled by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] after just six episodes.<ref name=\"BN\">{{cite web | title=Barnes and Noble| work=Police Squad!

Many of the gags on the show were recycled to all three films.\n\n[[Alan North]] played the role of Captain Ed Hocken on the show; in the films, the role was played by [[George Kennedy (actor)|George Kennedy]]. [[Peter Lupus]] co-starred as Officer Norberg, but in the films, [[O.J. Simpson]] appeared as the similarly named Officer Nordberg. Apart from Nielsen, the only actors to reprise their role in the films were [[Ed Williams (actor)|Ed Williams]], who played scientist Ted Olson, and [[Tiny Ron Taylor|Ronald \"Tiny Ron\" Taylor]] as Al, a very tall officer who is seen only from the neck down. [[Robert Goulet]], who appeared as one of the \"special guest stars\" who were invariably killed off at the beginning of their episodes, appeared as the villain, Quentin Hapsburg, in the [[The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear|second ''Naked Gun'' film]]. [[Joyce Brothers]] played herself in the [[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!|first ''Naked Gun'' film]]. She also played herself in the fourth episode of the show.<ref name=\"Tv3\">{{cite web | title=Dr. Joyce Brothers at Tv.com| work=appearances |url=http://www.tv.com/dr.-joyce-brothers/person/902/appearances.html| accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref>\n\nEach episode featured end credits over a 1970s style [[freeze frame shot|freeze frame]] of the final scene, except that the frame was not frozen \u2013 the actors simply stood motionless in position while other activities (pouring coffee, a convict escaping, a chimpanzee throwing paper) continued around them.\n\n==Episodes==\nEach episode had two different titles. The first title was shown on the screen, while announcer [[Hank Simms]] (famous for his announcing style on [[Quinn Martin]] Detective shows), reads the second one instead. The episodes were written to be shown in a specific order, which was indicated on-screen in two ways. Firstly, the episode number often corresponds to the number of garbage cans that Frank's car crashes into when it arrives at the crime scene. Secondly, during each episode's epilogue sequence, either Drebin or Hocken states that the guilty party brought to justice is being sent to Stateville Prison \u2013 and lists all the characters sent there from previous episodes, in reverse order, where applicable.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#2C598D\"| No.\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#2C598D\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#2C598D\"| Directed by\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#2C598D\"| Written by\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#2C598D\"| Original air date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#2C598D\"| Production<br>code\n{{Episode list \n| EpisodeNumber   = 1 \n| Title           = [[A Substantial Gift (The Broken Promise)]]\n| DirectedBy      = [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker|David Zucker<br />Jim Abrahams<br />Jerry Zucker]]\n| WrittenBy       = David Zucker<br />Jim Abrahams<br />Jerry Zucker\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|3|4}}\n| ProdCode        = 1PS01 \n| ShortSummary    = ''Special guest star:'' [[Lorne Greene]]<br />Sally Decker ([[Kathryn Leigh Scott]]), a teller at a credit union, murders her boss so she can steal money from the credit union and pay her orthodontist the money she owed.

It was created by [[David Zucker (director)|David Zucker]], [[Jim Abrahams]], and [[Jerry Zucker]], and starred [[Leslie Nielsen]] as [[Frank Drebin]]. A [[Parody|spoof]] of [[police procedural]]s, the series featured [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker]]'s usual [[sight gag]]s, [[wordplay]] and [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequiturs]]. While a parody of many television shows and movies, it bore a particular resemblance to the [[Lee Marvin]] cop show, ''[[M Squad]]'' (especially the opening credits) and the late 1960s series ''[[Felony Squad]]''.<ref>The creators stated this in a featurette for ''[[The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear]].''</ref> Although the show was canceled after six episodes, it later successfully spawned [[The Naked Gun|''The Naked Gun'' film series]] from 1988 to 1994. In 2013, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked it #7 on their list of 60 shows that were \"Cancelled Too Soon\".<ref>Roush, Matt (June 3, 2013). \"Cancelled Too Soon\".

Despite critical acclaim, the show was canceled by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] after just six episodes.<ref name=\"BN\">{{cite web | title=Barnes and Noble| work=Police Squad!

Many of the gags on the show were recycled to all three films.\n\n[[Alan North]] played the role of Captain Ed Hocken on the show; in the films, the role was played by [[George Kennedy (actor)|George Kennedy]]. [[Peter Lupus]] co-starred as Officer Norberg, but in the films, [[O.J. Simpson]] appeared as the similarly named Officer Nordberg.

[[Robert Goulet]], who appeared as one of the \"special guest stars\" who were invariably killed off at the beginning of their episodes, appeared as the villain, Quentin Hapsburg, in the [[The Naked Gun 2\u00bd: The Smell of Fear|second ''Naked Gun'' film]]. [[Joyce Brothers]] played herself in the [[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!|first ''Naked Gun'' film]].

The first title was shown on the screen, while announcer [[Hank Simms]] (famous for his announcing style on [[Quinn Martin]] Detective shows), reads the second one instead. The episodes were written to be shown in a specific order, which was indicated on-screen in two ways. Firstly, the episode number often corresponds to the number of garbage cans that Frank's car crashes into when it arrives at the crime scene. Secondly, during each episode's epilogue sequence, either Drebin or Hocken states that the guilty party brought to justice is being sent to Stateville Prison \u2013 and lists all the characters sent there from previous episodes, in reverse order, where applicable.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:white\"\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#2C598D\"| No.\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#2C598D\"| Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#2C598D\"| Directed by\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#2C598D\"| Written by\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#2C598D\"| Original air date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background:#2C598D\"| Production<br>code\n{{Episode list \n| EpisodeNumber   = 1 \n| Title           = [[A Substantial Gift (The Broken Promise)]]\n| DirectedBy      = [[Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker|David Zucker<br />Jim Abrahams<br />Jerry Zucker]]\n| WrittenBy       = David Zucker<br />Jim Abrahams<br />Jerry Zucker\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1982|3|4}}\n| ProdCode        = 1PS01 \n| ShortSummary    = ''Special guest star:'' [[Lorne Greene]]<br />Sally Decker ([[Kathryn Leigh Scott]]), a teller at a credit union, murders her boss so she can steal money from the credit union and pay her orthodontist the money she owed.

In its annual \"Cheers and Jeers\" issue, ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine called the explanation for the cancellation \"the most stupid reason a network ever gave for ending a series.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/07/a-lost-script-from-the-files-of-the-police-squad.html|website=www.vulture.com|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref><!-- This is NOT mentioned in the commentary, so it needs a(nother) proper citation. -->\n\n[[Matt Groening]], creator of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', has said, \"If ''Police Squad!'' had been made twenty years later, it would have been a smash.

{"title_page": "Anti-sweatshop movement", "text_new": "'''Anti-sweatshop movement''' refers to campaigns to improve the conditions of workers in [[sweatshop]]s, i.e. manufacturing places characterized by low wages, poor working conditions and often [[child labor]]. It started in the 19th century in industrialized countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.<ref name=\":4\">Miers, Suzanne (2003). ''Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem''. Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California.</ref>\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor. The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>\"Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8\". ''finduslaw.com''.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, with the advent of [[globalization]], movements were formed to protest the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in poorer countries by companies based in wealthy countries. [[Noam Chomsky]] said in ''[[The Nation]]'' that the anti-sweatshop movement is in some ways, he said, \"like the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], except that in this case it's striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. It's another example of how different constituencies are working together.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky\">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 \"Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky\", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]</ref>  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.\n\nWith the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.<ref name=\":0\">Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. \"Workers of the world unite? The contemporary anti-sweatshop movement and the struggle for social justice in the Americas.\" ''Work and Occupations'' 32.4 (2005): 464-485.</ref>  As corporations globalize, many sweatshop movements have begun to see \"worker internationalization\" as one of the only viable solution; however, this requires strong labor movements, sufficient resources, and a commitment to mobilizing all workers, including women, which can be difficult to do at an international scale, as has been the case in the Americas.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== #WhoMadeMyClothes ==\nThe #WhoMadeMyClothes hashtag was launched in 2013 by [[Fashion Revolution]] co-founders, Carry Somers and Orsola de Castro.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Blanchard|first=Tamsin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/commentisfree/2019/apr/22/who-made-my-clothes-stand-up-for-workers-rights-with-fashion-revolution-week|title=Who Made My Clothes?

On Twitter, 31.82% of the tweets with #WhoMadeMyClothes were posted by users from the United Kingdom.

To promote the hashtag in 2015, [[Fashion Revolution]] released a video titled \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt - A Social Experiment\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.red-dot.org/about-red-dot/magazine/2-euro-t-shirt/|title=Award-winning design and its makers: \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt \u2013 A Social Experiment\u201d|last=Dot|first=Red|website=www.red-dot.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The video showed a vending machine selling t-shirts for 2 Euros. When people went to purchase the shirt, a video played describing the working conditions in which the shirt was made. By the end, people chose to donate to the cause of increasing supply chain transparency instead of buying the t-shirt. The video has over 7.9 million views. Their 2018 campaign film uploaded on April 22nd, 2018 was awarded the Best Green Fashion Film award at the Fashion Film Festival Milano and has over 54,000 views to date.<ref>{{Citation|title=Who Made My Clothes?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTnFfa0qHIM|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nWith the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes as the channel for the movement, [[Fashion Revolution]] has increased general public awareness of the improper work conditions faced by garment workers in Bangladesh, India, and other developing countries with cheap labor. This increasing awareness has pushed fashion companies to be more transparent about their manufacturing and supply chain process. As of June 2018, 172 brands across 68 countries have revealed more information about their supply chains than in previous years. In response to the hashtag, #WhoMadeMyClothes, more than 3,838 global brands took to social media to respond with real information about their suppliers and workers.\n\n== Effectiveness of the movement ==\nA study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.<ref name=\":3\">Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. \u201cMovements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000\u201d. ''Social Forces'' 90.2 (2011): 425\u2013451. Web.</ref>  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Debate on the effects of sweatshops ==\n\n=== Criticisms ===\nThe criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, begins with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitative nature.<ref name=\":3\" /> Matt Zwolinski argues that though sweatshop laborers technically \"choose\" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not \"fully voluntary\" and that while sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker \"consents\" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that cause more harm than good to the laborer overall.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another criticism includes the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages. This often requires children to be taken out of school, thus disrupting their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that may endanger their health.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arguments in favor ===\n==== Provision of opportunities ====\nSome people, such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f, argue that the anti-sweatshop movement \"risks harming the very people it is aiming to help.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html\n| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops\n| website = www.nytimes.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref> This is because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty.<ref name=\":2\" />  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Effects on employment ====\nEven if a company does not move to another country with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good cost, the less the demand for it is. Economists argue that even though the labor is \"exploitative,\" it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.<ref>Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. \"The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment.\" ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.</ref>\n\n=== Views of economists ===\nMost economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment.

The three glamorous fashion bloggers, Frida, Ludvig and Anniken, gave up their glam-life in Norway and went to Phnom Penh, Cambodia for a month to see the reality of the conditions of people who make their clothes. The journey begins to question the poor standards of the working conditions that keep up with the massive manufacturing of clothing for people stay trendy. ''Sweatshop Deadly Fashion'' was released in ten minute episodes online on 19 January 2015. The show raises an awareness on the current issue of sweatshops in the clothing industry through advocacy from famous people in the fashion industry such as fashion bloggers.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Child labour]]\n* [[Craftivism#Anti-sweatshop]]\n* [[Nicholas D.

It started in the 19th century in industrialized countries such as the [[United States]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[United Kingdom]] to improve the conditions of workers in those countries.<ref name=Blackburn>Sheila Blackburn (1991) ''The Historical Journal'' '''34''' (1) 43-64 \"Ideology and Social Policy: The Origins of the Trade Boards Act\"</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSome of the earliest sweatshop critics were found in the 19th-century [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] movement that had originally coalesced in opposition to chattel [[slavery]], and many abolitionists saw similarities between slavery and sweatshop work. As slavery was successively outlawed in industrial countries between 1794 (in France) and 1865 (in the United States), some abolitionists sought to broaden the anti-slavery consensus to include other forms of harsh labor, including sweatshops. As it happened, the first significant law to address sweatshops (the [[Factory Act|Factory Act of 1833]]) was passed in the United Kingdom at the same time that the slave trade (1807) and ownership of slaves (1833) were made illegal.<ref name=\":4\">Miers, Suzanne (2003). ''Slavery in the Twentieth Century: The Evolution of a Global Problem''. Alta Mira Press, Walnut Creek, California.</ref>\n\nUltimately, the abolitionist movement split apart. Some advocates focused on working conditions and found common cause with trade unions and [[Marxists]] and socialist political groups, or [[progressive movement]] and the [[muckraker]]s. Others focused on the continued slave trade and [[involuntary servitude]] in the colonial world. For those groups that remained focused on slavery, sweatshops became one of the primary objects of controversy. Workplaces across multiple sectors of the economy were categorized as sweatshops. However, there were fundamental philosophical disagreements about what constituted slavery. Unable to agree on the status of sweatshops, the abolitionists working with the [[League of Nations]] and the United Nations ultimately backed away from efforts to define slavery, and focused instead on a common precursor of slavery \u2013 [[human trafficking]].<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThose focused on working conditions included [[Friedrich Engels]], whose book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844]]'' would inspire the Marxist movement named for his collaborator, [[Karl Marx]]. In the United Kingdom the Factory Act was revised six further times between 1844 and 1878 to help improve the condition of workers by limiting work hours and the use of child labor. The formation of the [[International Labour Organization]] in 1919 under the League of Nations and then the United Nations sought to address the plight of workers the world over. Concern over working conditions as described by muckraker journalists during the [[Progressive Era]] in the United States saw the passage of new workers rights laws and ultimately resulted in the [[Fair Labor Standards Act]] of 1938, passed during the [[New Deal]].<ref>\"Fair Labor Standards Act - FLSA - 29 U.S. Code Chapter 8\". ''finduslaw.com''.</ref>\n\nIn the late 20th century, with the advent of [[globalization]], movements were formed to protest the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in poorer countries by companies based in wealthy countries. [[Noam Chomsky]] said in ''[[The Nation]]'' that the anti-sweatshop movement is in some ways, he said, \"like the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]], except that in this case it's striking at the core of the relations of exploitation. It's another example of how different constituencies are working together.\"<ref name=\"Chomsky\">[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20000424/chomsky/2 \"Talking 'Anarchy' With Chomsky\", ''The Nation'', April 5, 2000]</ref>  On February 4, 1997 Mayor Ed Boyle of North Olmsted, Ohio introduced the first piece of legislation actually prohibiting the government of purchasing, renting, or taking on consignment any and all goods made under sweatshop conditions and including in the definition those goods made by political prisoners. This legislation was copied by other American cities such as Detroit, New York, and San Francisco. Later Mayor Boyle introduced the legislation to the Mayors and Managers Association where it was immediately passed and he was invited by President Clinton to address a panel studying the subject in Washington, DC.\n\nWith the rise of [[globalization]] and [[transnational corporations]] (TNCs) such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] or [[Gap Inc.|Gap]], many sweatshop laborers have lost autonomy and corporations have gained in their invincibility to anti-sweatshop laws within a particular country, as it is incredibly easy for them to simply move to another country if the laws become too restricting.<ref name=\":0\">Armbruster-Sandoval, Ralph. \"Workers of the world unite?

On Twitter, 31.82% of the tweets with #WhoMadeMyClothes were posted by users from the United Kingdom.

To promote the hashtag in 2015, [[Fashion Revolution]] released a video titled \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt - A Social Experiment\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.red-dot.org/about-red-dot/magazine/2-euro-t-shirt/|title=Award-winning design and its makers: \u201cThe 2 Euro T-Shirt \u2013 A Social Experiment\u201d|last=Dot|first=Red|website=www.red-dot.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The video showed a vending machine selling t-shirts for 2 Euros. When people went to purchase the shirt, a video played describing the working conditions in which the shirt was made. By the end, people chose to donate to the cause of increasing supply chain transparency instead of buying the t-shirt. The video has over 7.9 million views. Their 2018 campaign film uploaded on April 22nd, 2018 was awarded the Best Green Fashion Film award at the Fashion Film Festival Milano and has over 54,000 views to date.<ref>{{Citation|title=Who Made My Clothes?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTnFfa0qHIM|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nWith the hashtag #WhoMadeMyClothes as the channel for the movement, [[Fashion Revolution]] has increased general public awareness of the improper work conditions faced by garment workers in Bangladesh, India, and other developing countries with cheap labor. This increasing awareness has pushed fashion companies to be more transparent about their manufacturing and supply chain process. As of June 2018, 172 brands across 68 countries have revealed more information about their supply chains than in previous years. In response to the hashtag, #WhoMadeMyClothes, more than 3,838 global brands took to social media to respond with real information about their suppliers and workers.\n\n== Effectiveness of the movement ==\nA study published in 2011 found that while in most cases anti-sweatshop movements did not affect sales for companies using sweatshops, they did correspond with a decrease in the sales of well-known, more specialized brands and more intense movements caused more significant reduction in the sales.<ref name=\":3\">Bartley, Tim, and Curtis Child. \u201cMovements, Markets and Fields: The Effects of Anti-sweatshop Campaigns on U.S. Firms, 1993-2000\u201d. ''Social Forces'' 90.2 (2011): 425\u2013451. Web.</ref>  The same study also found that anti-sweatshop events also seemed to correspond with lower stock prices for the companies that were the target of these events, though some major anti-sweatshop events such the ''Kaksy'' lawsuit against Nike, did not result in any discernible change in stock price of the targeted company.  The study found that 64.1% of the companies targeted by anti-sweatshop movements saw drops in stock price in the five days following the anti-sweatshop event, and 56.4% saw drops in the two days following the event.  Though the study did find these slight negative economic effects, it did not find that, when taking into account companies of all reputations, anti-sweatshop movements or events damaged the reputation of the companies they targeted to a statistically significant degree; however, there does seem to be a slight undercutting of the reputations of companies with positive reputations when they are faced with anti-sweatshop campaigns, particularly intense ones.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Debate on the effects of sweatshops ==\n\n=== Criticism ===\nThe criticisms of sweatshops, and thus the reason for an anti-sweatshop movement, begins with the lack of safety regulations in sweatshops and their exploitative nature.<ref name=\":3\" /> Matt Zwolinski argues that though sweatshop laborers technically \"choose\" to work in sweatshops, this decision is not \"fully voluntary\" and that while sweatshops may provide opportunities that would not otherwise exist, when a worker \"consents\" to work in a sweatshop, they are also consenting to labor practices that cause more harm than good to the laborer overall.<ref name=\":3\" /> Another criticism includes the prevalence of child labor working heavy machinery for very low wages. This often requires children to be taken out of school, thus disrupting their education, and exposing them to very dangerous working conditions that may endanger their health.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Arguments in favor ===\n==== Provision of opportunities ====\nSome people, such as Pulitzer Prize winning journalist [[Nicholas Kristof]]f, argue that the anti-sweatshop movement \"risks harming the very people it is aiming to help.\"<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web\n| url = https://www.nytimes.com/library/magazine/home/20000924mag-sweatshops.html\n| title = Two Cheers for Sweatshops\n| website = www.nytimes.com\n| access-date = 2016-02-26\n}}</ref> This is because sweatshops signify the start of an industrial revolution in Asia and offer people a path towards making money and escaping poverty.<ref name=\":2\" />  The anti-sweatshop movement, in this view, can harm the impoverished workers by increasing labor costs for factories which, in turn, can incentivize turning to technology instead of people for labor and thus reduce the number of employees needed.  Additionally, if anti-sweatshop movements succeed and manage to get stricter guidelines passed, companies may move to countries with less strict laws governing sweatshops, thus removing a source of jobs and money for impoverished countries.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Effects on employment ====\nEven if a company does not move to another country with more relaxed labor laws, economic demand theory says that the more a good cost, the less the demand for it is. Economists argue that even though the labor is \"exploitative,\" it should be permitted, as trying to put regulations on sweatshop labor would only result in sweatshops needing fewer workers, thus reducing opportunities for individuals to make a living.<ref>Powell, Benjamin, and Matt Zwolinski. \"The ethical and economic case against sweatshop labor: A critical assessment.\" ''Journal of business ethics''107.4 (2012): 449-472.</ref>\n\n=== Views of economists ===\nMost economists say that sweatshops can be a benefit to Third World workers and the anti-sweatshop movement could reduce Third World employment and investment. The economic ways to think about this issue, employers and employees can both get benefits when they voluntarily sign the contract, no matter how low the wages are from the external\u2019s point of view.

Christopher Columbus was an Italian Jew. The beginning of the inquisition was August 2, 1492. The day that Christopher Columbus set sail to the trip to the Indias, was on August 3, 1492. Most of the people that boarded the 3 ships were Jews running from the inquisition.\n\n== History ==\n\n\"New Christians\", or [[Marranos]], fled the Iberian peninsula to escape persecution and seek religious freedom during the 16th and 17th centuries. It is estimated that some reached northern areas of Colombia, which at the time was known as [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]]. Most if not all of these people assimilated into Colombian society. Some continue to practice Jewish rituals as family traditions.\n\nIn the 18th century, practicing [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] came from [[Jamaica]] and [[Cura\u00e7ao]], where they had flourished under English and Dutch rule. These Jews started practicing their religion openly in Colombia at the end of the 18th century, although it was not officially legal to do so, given the established Catholic Church. After independence, Judaism was recognized as a legal religion. The government granted the Jews land for a cemetery.\n\nMany Jews who came during the 18th and 19th centuries achieved prominent positions in Colombian society. Some married local women and felt they had to abandon or diminish their Jewish identity. These included author [[Jorge Isaacs]] of English Jewish ancestry, the industrialist [[James Martin Eder]] (who adopted the more Christian name of Santiago Eder when he translated his name to Spanish) born into the [[Latvian Jew]]ish community, as well as the De Lima, Salazar, Espinoza, Arias, Ramirez, Perez and Lobo families of [[Antillean]] [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Sephardim]]. Coincidentally, these persons and their families settled in the [[Valle del Cauca department|Cauca Valley]] region of Colombia. They have continued to be influential members of society in cities such as [[Cali]]. Over the generations most of their descendants were raised as secular Christians.\n\nDuring the early part of the 20th century, numerous Sephardic Jewish immigrants came from Greece, Turkey, North Africa and [[Syria]]. Shortly after, Jewish immigrants began to arrive from Eastern Europe. A wave of [[Ashkenazi]] immigrants came after the rise of Nazism in 1933 and the imposition of anti-Semitic laws and practices, followed by as many as 17,000 German Jews. From 1939 until the end of World War II, immigration was put to a halt by anti-immigrant feelings in the country and restrictions on immigration from Germany.<ref>Ignacio Klich & Jeff Lesser, ''Arab and Jewish Immigrants in Latin America: Images and Realities,'' Psychology Press, 1997, pages 76-78</ref> \n\nColombia asked Germans who were on the U.S. blacklist to leave and allowed Jewish refugees in the country illegally to stay.<ref name=LB>Latin America during World War II by Thomas M. Leonard, John F. Bratzel, P.117</ref> President Lariano Gomez actively supported and helped the Jewish Community through this troubling time. The Jewish population increased dramatically in the 1950s and 1960s, and institutions such as synagogues, schools and social clubs were established throughout the largest cities in the country.\n\nA wave of kidnappings during the last decade of the 20th century led some members of Colombia's Jewish community to emigrate. Most settled in [[Miami]] and other parts of the United States. Successes in the nation's [[Democratic security|Democratic Security Policy]] has encouraged citizens to return; it has drastically reduced violence in the rural areas and criminality rates in urban areas, as well as in spurring the economy. The situation in Colombia has improved to the extent that many Venezuelan Jews are now seeking refuge in Colombia.\n\n==Modern Community==\n\nAs of the 21st century, approximately 8,000 practicing Jews live in Colombia. Most of them are concentrated in [[Bogot\u00e1]], with about 3,500 members, and [[Cali]], with about 1,000 members. New communities are also found in [[Barranquilla]] and [[Medell\u00edn]]. Very few Jews practice religious observance; among those who do, the majority are [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].

It is estimated that some reached northern areas of Colombia, which at the time was known as [[New Kingdom of Granada|New Granada]]. Most if not all of these people assimilated into Colombian society. Some continue to practice Jewish rituals as family traditions.\n\nIn the 18th century, practicing [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews]] came from [[Jamaica]] and [[Cura\u00e7ao]], where they had flourished under English and Dutch rule. These Jews started practicing their religion openly in Colombia at the end of the 18th century, although it was not officially legal to do so, given the established Catholic Church. After independence, Judaism was recognized as a legal religion. The government granted the Jews land for a cemetery.\n\nMany Jews who came during the 18th and 19th centuries achieved prominent positions in Colombian society. Some married local women and felt they had to abandon or diminish their Jewish identity. These included author [[Jorge Isaacs]] of English Jewish ancestry, the industrialist [[James Martin Eder]] (who adopted the more Christian name of Santiago Eder when he translated his name to Spanish) born into the [[Latvian Jew]]ish community, as well as the De Lima, Salazar, Espinoza, Arias, Ramirez, Perez and Lobo families of [[Antillean]] [[Spanish and Portuguese Jews|Sephardim]]. Coincidentally, these persons and their families settled in the [[Valle del Cauca department|Cauca Valley]] region of Colombia. They have continued to be influential members of society in cities such as [[Cali]]. Over the generations most of their descendants were raised as secular Christians.\n\nDuring the early part of the 20th century, numerous Sephardic Jewish immigrants came from Greece, Turkey, North Africa and [[Syria]]. Shortly after, Jewish immigrants began to arrive from Eastern Europe. A wave of [[Ashkenazi]] immigrants came after the rise of Nazism in 1933 and the imposition of anti-Semitic laws and practices, followed by as many as 17,000 German Jews. From 1939 until the end of World War II, immigration was put to a halt by anti-immigrant feelings in the country and restrictions on immigration from Germany.<ref>Ignacio Klich & Jeff Lesser, ''Arab and Jewish Immigrants in Latin America: Images and Realities,'' Psychology Press, 1997, pages 76-78</ref> \n\nColombia asked Germans who were on the U.S. blacklist to leave and allowed Jewish refugees in the country illegally to stay.<ref name=LB>Latin America during World War II by Thomas M. Leonard, John F. Bratzel, P.117</ref> President Lariano Gomez actively supported and helped the Jewish Community through this troubling time. The Jewish population increased dramatically in the 1950s and 1960s, and institutions such as synagogues, schools and social clubs were established throughout the largest cities in the country.\n\nA wave of kidnappings during the last decade of the 20th century led some members of Colombia's Jewish community to emigrate. Most settled in [[Miami]] and other parts of the United States. Successes in the nation's [[Democratic security|Democratic Security Policy]] has encouraged citizens to return; it has drastically reduced violence in the rural areas and criminality rates in urban areas, as well as in spurring the economy. The situation in Colombia has improved to the extent that many Venezuelan Jews are now seeking refuge in Colombia.\n\n==Modern Community==\n\nAs of the 21st century, approximately 8,000 practicing Jews live in Colombia. Most of them are concentrated in [[Bogot\u00e1]], with about 3,500 members, and [[Cali]], with about 1,000 members. New communities are also found in [[Barranquilla]] and [[Medell\u00edn]]. Very few Jews practice religious observance; among those who do, the majority are [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]].
