The episode was written by Kevin Deiboldt and Julia Ruchman and directed by Laura Belsey. After the airing of this episode, ''The Walking Dead'' went on hiatus as post-production could not be concluded on the season finale due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Plot==\nPrincess introduces herself to Eugene, Ezekiel and Yumiko, but as they are trying to figure out her unique personality, a group of walkers appear. Before they can stop her, Princess uses a machine gun to put down the walkers, which frightens their horses away. Princess apologizes profusely and knows where they can get transportation. They start walking across the city, but the trio find Princess' directions to be erratic. At one point, they walk through a live minefield where they find the remains of their horses, and Eugene later realizes they could have taken a much quicker route. Princess again apologizes, admitting she's been alone for so long and only wanted to endear herself to them. She takes them to a garage with transportation - bicycles - and the trio prepares to depart for their meeting with Stephanie. They have a change of heart, and let Princess join them.\n\nBeta hears voices in his head and leads his horde of walkers towards Oceanside via Alexandria. Aware of their approach, most of Alexandria has fled to a nearby hospital, with only Alden and Aaron staying behind to report on Beta's movements to Gabriel via walkie. While waiting, Carol and Kelly look for radio parts for Luke, and Carol apologizes to Kelly about what happened at the cave; Kelly accepts her apology and believes Connie is still alive. Negan tries to apologize to Lydia for killing Alpha. Lydia emotionally struggles with both her anger towards Negan for the act, but also letting out her hatred of Alpha, and the two hug. Judith travels with Daryl while he patrols, killing a Whisperer spy. Judith tells Daryl that after Michonne's departure, she has become more concerned about losing more of her family. Daryl can't promise he will never leave, but assures Judith she has a larger family than just him.\n\nThe voices in Beta's head direct him towards the hospital. Alden and Aaron try to contact Gabriel, but are captured by a group of Whisperers. Beta and his horde arrive at the hospital.\n\n==Production==\n[[Samantha Morton]] is removed from the opening credits.

It was one of two substantial parts of the Palace of Whitehall to survive a catastrophic fire in January 1698, the other being [[Inigo Jones]]'s classical [[Banqueting House]].

The Westminster Gate or Kings Street Gate further south was built in a simpler more classical style with circular corner towers and domed turrets, and was demolished in 1723.  The Holbein Gate is shown in drawings and engravings, including an engraving made by [[George Vertue]] in 1725 and published in 1747 in Vol. I of ''[[Vetusta Monumenta]]''.\n\nThe gate was a rectangular building of three floors, with the principal rooms on the upper two floors.  Projecting square bases on each corner supporting octagonal towers and turrets.  A passageway between the towers approximately {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide allowed traffic to pass beneath a flat archway, with one footway to the east and possibly a second footway to the west through the towers (although the west footway may have been blocked and then cleared).  Above the arch was an [[oriel window]] with two row of six lights (one to either side and four in the centre) on the first floor, and a window of four lights in a double row on the first floor.  The top of the tower was surmounted by a parapet with battlements.  Each face of the octagonal towers had two-light windows in double rows.  Both sides of the gate were faced with chequerboard patterns of flint and stone, and also decorative carved panels, including a royal coat of arms above the arch, gryphons holding shields, and other royal emblems, such as the portcullis, fleur-de-lys and Tudor rose.  Roundels to either side of the large central windows held with busts, possibly by [[Giovanni da Maiano]]. (Three terracotta busts by [[Pietro Torrigiano]] owned by the Wright family in [[Hatfield Peverel]] until the 1920s were thought to come from the Gate, but later scholarship doubts any connection.)  The arch was later filled in down to the springing, flattening its profile.  A gallery to the west overlooked the Royal Tiltyard (now [[Horse Guards Parade]]) leading eventually to St James's Park.  Another gallery led to the Cockpit.\n\nThe upper storey was used as the Paper Office, from perhaps 1672 until 1756.  The lower storey was used as lodgings.

More exactly, it can be proven that breaking FSB is at least as difficult as solving a certain [[NP-complete]] problem known as '''regular syndrome decoding''' so FSB is [[provably secure cryptographic hash function|provably secure]]. Though it is not known whether [[NP-complete]] problems are solvable in [[polynomial time]], it is often assumed that they are not.\n\nSeveral versions of FSB have been proposed, the latest of which was submitted to the [[NIST hash function competition|SHA-3 cryptography competition]] but was rejected in the first round. Though all versions of FSB claim provable security, some preliminary versions were eventually broken. \n<ref>{{Citation\n  | last1 = Saarinen| first1 = Markku-Juhani O.\n  | title = Linearization Attacks Against Syndrome Based Hashes\n  | year = 2007  \n  | series = Progress in Cryptology \u2013 INDOCRYPT 2007\n}}\n</ref>  \nThe design of the latest version of FSB has however taken this attack into account and remains secure to all currently known attacks.\n\nAs usual, provable security comes at a cost. FSB is slower than traditional hash functions and uses quite a lot of memory, which makes it impractical on memory constrained environments. Furthermore, the compression function used in FSB needs a large output size to guarantee security.

This function will only work on messages with length <math>s = w\\log(n/w)</math>; <math>r</math> will be the size of the output. Furthermore, we want <math>n,r,w,s</math> and <math>\\log(n/w)</math> to be natural numbers, where <math>\\log</math> denotes the [[binary logarithm]]. The reason for <math>w \\cdot \\log(n/w) > r</math> is that we want <math>\\phi</math> to be a compression function, so the input must be larger than the output. We will later use the [[Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction]] to extend the domain to inputs of arbitrary lengths.\n \nThe basis of this function consists of a (randomly chosen) binary <math>r \\times n</math> matrix <math>H</math> which acts on a message of <math>n</math> bits by [[matrix multiplication]]. Here we encode the <math>w\\log(n/w)</math>-bit message as a vector in <math>(\\mathbf{F}_2)^n</math>, the <math>n</math>-dimensional [[vector space]] over the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of two elements, so the output will be a message of <math>r</math> bits.\n\nFor security purposes as well as to get a faster hash speed we want to use only \u201cregular words of weight <math>w</math>\u201d as input for our matrix.\n\n=== Definitions ===\n* A message is called a '''word of weight <math>w</math> and length <math>n</math>''' if it consists of <math>n</math> bits and exactly <math>w</math> of those bits are ones.\n* A word of weight <math>w</math> and length <math>n</math> is called '''regular''' if in every interval <math>[(i-1)(n/w), i(n/w))</math> it contains exactly one nonzero entry for all <math>0 < i < w+1 </math>. More intuitively, this means that if we chop up the message in ''w'' equal parts, then each part contains exactly one nonzero entry.\n\n===The compression function===\nThere are exactly <math>(n/w)^w</math> different regular words of weight <math>w</math> and length <math>n</math>, so we need exactly <math>\\log((n/w)^w)= w \\log(n/w) = s</math> bits of data to encode these regular words. We fix a bijection from the set of bit strings of length <math>s</math> to the set of regular words of weight <math>w</math> and length <math>n</math> and then the FSB compression function is defined as follows :\n\n# input: a message of size <math>s</math>\n# convert to regular word of length <math>n</math> and weight <math>w</math>\n# multiply by the matrix <math>H</math>\n# output: hash of size <math>r</math>\n\nThis version is usually called '''syndrome-based compression'''. It is very slow and in practice done in a different and faster way resulting in '''fast syndrome-based compression'''. We split <math>H</math> into sub-matrices <math>H_i</math> of size <math>r \\times n/w</math> and we fix a bijection from the bit strings of length <math>w\\log(n/w)</math> to the set of sequences of <math>w</math> numbers between 1 and <math>n/w</math>. This is equivalent to a bijection  to the set of regular words of length <math>n</math> and weight <math>w</math>, since we can see such a word as a sequence of numbers between 1 and <math>n/w</math>. The compression function looks as follows:\n\n# Input: message of size <math>s</math>\n# Convert <math>s</math> to a sequence of <math>w</math> numbers <math>s_1,\\dots,s_w</math> between 1 and <math>n/w</math>\n# Add the corresponding columns of the matrices <math>H_i</math> to obtain a binary string a length <math>r</math>\n# Output: hash of size <math>r</math>\n\nWe can now use the [[Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction]] to generalize the compression function to accept inputs of arbitrary lengths.\n\n===Example of the compression===\n'''Situation and initialization''': Hash a message <math>s = 010011</math> using <math>4 \\times 12</math> matrix H <br />\n<math>\nH = \\left(\\begin{array}{llllcllllcllll}\n1&0&1&1 &~& 0&1&0&0 &~& 1&0&1&1 \\\\\n0&1&0&0 &~& 0&1&1&1 &~& 0&1&0&0 \\\\\n0&1&1&1 &~& 0&1&0&0 &~& 1&0&1&0 \\\\\n1&1&0&0 &~& 1&0&1&1 &~& 0&0&0&1 \n\\end{array}\\right)\n</math><br />\nthat is separated into <math>w = 3</math> sub-blocks <math>H_1</math>, <math>H_2</math>, <math>H_3</math>.\n\n'''Algorithm''':\n# We split the input <math>s</math> into <math>w = 3</math> parts of length <math>\\log_2(12/3) = 2</math> and we get <math>s_1 = 01</math>, <math>s_2 = 00</math>, <math>s_3 = 11</math>.\n# We convert each <math>s_i</math> into an integer and get <math>s_1 = 1</math>, <math>s_2 = 0</math>, <math>s_3 = 3</math>.\n# From the first sub-matrix <math>H_1</math>, we pick the column 2, from the second sub-matrix <math>H_2</math> the column 1 and from the third sub-matrix the column 4.\n# We add the chosen columns and obtain the result <math>r = 0111 \\oplus 0001 \\oplus 1001 = 1111</math>.\n\n== Security proof of FSB ==\nThe [[Merkle\u2013Damg\u00e5rd construction]] is proven to base its security only on the security of the used compression function. So we only need to show that the compression function <math>\\phi</math> is secure.\n\nA cryptographic hash function needs to be secure in three different aspects:\n\n# Pre-image resistance: Given a Hash ''h'' it should be hard to find a message ''m'' such that Hash(''m'')=''h''\n# Second pre-image resistance:\tGiven a message ''m''<sub>1</sub> it should be hard to find a message ''m''<sub>2</sub> such that Hash(''m''<sub>1</sub>) = Hash(''m''<sub>2</sub>)\n# Collision resistance: It should be hard to find two different messages ''m''<sub>1</sub> and ''m''<sub>2</sub> such that Hash(''m''<sub>1</sub>)=Hash(''m''<sub>2</sub>)\n\nNote that if an adversary can find a second pre-image, than he can certainly find a collision. This means that if we can prove our system to be collision resistant, it will certainly be second-pre-image resistant.\n\nUsually in cryptography hard means something like \u201calmost certainly beyond the reach of any adversary who must be prevented from breaking the system\u201d. We will however need a more exact meaning of the word hard. We will take hard to mean \u201cThe runtime of any algorithm that finds a collision or pre-image will depend exponentially on size of the hash value\u201d. This means that by relatively small additions to the hash size, we can quickly reach high security.\n\n===Pre-image resistance and regular syndrome decoding (RSD) ===\nAs said before, the security of FSB depends on a problem called '''regular syndrome decoding (RSD)'''. Syndrome decoding is originally a problem from [[coding theory]] but its NP-completeness makes it a nice application for cryptography. Regular syndrome decoding is a special case of [[decoding methods|syndrome decoding]] and is defined as follows:\n\nDefinition of RSD: given <math>w</math> matrices <math>H_i</math> of dimension <math>r \\times (n/w)</math> and a bit string <math>S</math> of length <math>r</math> such that there exists a set of <math>w</math> columns, one in each <math>H_i</math>, summing to <math>S</math>. Find such a set of columns.\n\nThis problem has been proven to be [[NP-complete]] by a reduction from [[3-dimensional matching]]. Again, though it is not known whether there exist [[polynomial time]] algorithms for solving NP-complete problems, none are known and finding one would be a huge discovery.\n \nIt is easy to see that finding a pre-image of a given hash <math>S</math> is exactly equivalent to this problem, so the problem of finding pre-images in FSB must also be NP-complete.\n\nWe still need to prove collision resistance. For this we need another NP-complete variation of RSD: '''2-regular null syndrome decoding'''.\n\n===Collision resistance and 2-regular null syndrome decoding (2-RNSD)===\nDefinition of 2-RNSD: Given <math>w</math> matrices <math>H_i</math> of dimension <math>r \\times (n/w)</math> and a bit string <math>S</math> of length <math>r</math> such that there exists a set of <math>w'</math> columns, two or zero in each <math>H_i</math>, summing to zero. <math>(0 < w' < 2w)</math>. Find such a set of columns.\n\n2-RNSD has also been proven to be [[NP-complete]] by a reduction from [[3-dimensional matching]].\n\nJust like RSD is in essence equivalent to finding a regular word <math>w</math> such that <math>Hw = S</math>, 2-RNSD is equivalent to finding a 2-regular word <math>w'</math> such that <math>Hw'=0</math>. A 2-regular word of length <math>n</math> and weight <math>w</math> is a bit string of length <math>n</math> such that in every interval <math>[(i-1)w , iw)</math> exactly two or zero entries are equal to 1. Note that a 2-regular word is just a sum of two regular words.\n\nSuppose that we have found a collision, so we have Hash(''m''<sub>1</sub>) = Hash(''m''<sub>2</sub>) with <math>m_1\\neq m_2</math>. Then we can find two regular words <math>w_1</math> and <math>w_2</math> such that <math>Hw_1=Hw_2</math> . We then have <math>H(w_1+w_2)= Hw_1 + Hw_2 =2Hw_1=0</math>; <math>(w_1 + w_2)</math> is a sum of two different regular words and so must be a 2-regular word of which the hash is zero, so we have solved an instance of 2-RNSD. We conclude that finding collisions in FSB is at least as difficult as solving 2-RNSD and so must be NP-complete.\n\nThe latest versions of FSB use the compression function [[Whirlpool (cryptography)|Whirlpool]] to further compress the hash output. Though this cannot be proven, the authors argue that this last compression does not reduce security. Note that even if one were able to find collisions in Whirlpool, one would still need to find the collisions pre-images in the original FSB compression function to find a collision in FSB.\n\n===Examples===\nSolving RSD, we are in the opposite situation as when hashing. Using the same values as in the previous example, we are given <math>H</math> separated into <math>w=3</math> sub-blocks and a string <math>r = 1111</math>. We are asked to find in each sub-block exactly one column such that they would all sum to <math>r</math>. The expected answer is thus <math>s_1 = 1</math>, <math>s_2 = 0</math>, <math>s_3 = 3</math>. This is known to be hard to compute for large matrices.\n\nIn 2-RNSD we want to find in each sub-block not one column, but two or zero such that they would sum up to 0000 (and not to <math>r</math>). In the example, we might use column (counting from 0) 2 and 3 from <math>H_1</math>, no column from <math>H_2</math> column 0 and 2 from <math>H_3</math>. More solutions are possible, for example might use no columns from <math>H_3</math>.\n\n===Linear cryptanalysis===\nThe [[Provably secure cryptographic hash function|provable security]] of FSB means that finding collisions is NP-complete. But the proof is a reduction to a problem with asymptotically hard [[worst-case complexity]]. This offers only limited security assurance as there still can be an algorithm that easily solves the problem for a subset of the problem space. For example, there exists a [[Linear cryptanalysis|linearization]] method that can be used to produce collisions of in a matter of seconds on a desktop PC for early variants of FSB with claimed 2^128 security. It is shown that the hash function offers minimal pre-image or collision resistance when the message space is chosen in a specific way.\n\n===Practical security results===\nThe following table shows the complexity of the best known attacks against FSB.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Output size (bits)\n!Complexity of collision search\n!Complexity of inversion\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''160''' || 2<sup>100.3</sup> || 2<sup>163.6</sup> \n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''224''' || 2<sup>135.3</sup> || 2<sup>229.0</sup>\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''256''' || 2<sup>190.0</sup> || 2<sup>261.0</sup>\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''384''' || 2<sup>215.5</sup> || 2<sup>391.5</sup>\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''512''' || 2<sup>285.6</sup> || 2<sup>527.4</sup>\n|}\n\n==Genesis==\nFSB is a speed-up version of syndrome-based hash function (SB). In the case of SB the compression function is very similar to the encoding function of [[Niederreiter cryptosystem|Niederreiter's version]] of [[McEliece cryptosystem]]. Instead of using the parity check matrix of a permuted [[Goppa code]], SB uses a random matrix <math>H</math>. From the security point of view this can only strengthen the system.\n\n==Other properties==\n* Both the block size of the hash function and the output size are completely scalable.\n* The speed can be adjusted by adjusting the number of bitwise operations used by FSB per input bit.\n* The security can be adjusted by adjusting the output size.\n* Bad instances exist and one must take care when choosing the matrix <math>H</math>.\n* The matrix used in the compression function may grow large in certain situations. This might be a limitation when trying to use FSB on memory constrained devices. This problem was solved in the related hash function called Improved FSB, which is still [[Provably secure cryptographic hash function|provably secure]], but relies on slightly stronger assumptions.\n\n==Variants==\nIn 2007, IFSB was published.<ref>https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/Matthieu.Finiasz/research/2007/finiasz-gaborit-sendrier-ecrypt-hash-workshop07.pdf</ref> In 2010, S-FSB was published, which is 30% faster than the original.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_CASED/Publikationen/2010/S-FSB_An_Improved_Variant_of_the_FSB_Hash_Family.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222135653/https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_CASED/Publikationen/2010/S-FSB_An_Improved_Variant_of_the_FSB_Hash_Family.pdf |archive-date=2015-12-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, [[D.

More exactly, it can be proven that breaking FSB is at least as difficult as solving a certain [[NP-complete]] problem known as '''regular syndrome decoding''' so FSB is [[provably secure cryptographic hash function|provably secure]]. Though it is not known whether [[NP-complete]] problems are solvable in [[polynomial time]], it is often assumed that they are not.\n\nSeveral versions of FSB have been proposed, the latest of which was submitted to the [[NIST hash function competition|SHA-3 cryptography competition]] but was rejected in the first round. Though all versions of FSB claim provable security, some preliminary versions were eventually broken. \n<ref>{{Citation\n  | last1 = Saarinen| first1 = Markku-Juhani O.\n  | title = Linearization Attacks Against Syndrome Based Hashes\n  | year = 2007  \n  | series = Progress in Cryptology \u2013 INDOCRYPT 2007\n}}\n</ref>  \nThe design of the latest version of FSB has however taken this attack into account and remains secure to all currently known attacks.\n\nAs usual, provable security comes at a cost. FSB is slower than traditional hash functions and uses quite a lot of memory, which makes it impractical on memory constrained environments. Furthermore, the compression function used in FSB needs a large output size to guarantee security. This last problem has been solved in recent versions by simply compressing the output by another compression function called [[Whirlpool (cryptography)|Whirlpool]].

Find such a set of columns.\n\n2-RNSD has also been proven to be [[NP-complete]] by a reduction from [[3-dimensional matching]].\n\nJust like RSD is in essence equivalent to finding a regular word <math>w</math> such that <math>Hw = S</math>, 2-RNSD is equivalent to finding a 2-regular word <math>w'</math> such that <math>Hw'=0</math>. A 2-regular word of length <math>n</math> and weight <math>w</math> is a bit string of length <math>n</math> such that in every interval <math>[(i-1)w , iw)</math> exactly two or zero entries are equal to 1. Note that a 2-regular word is just a sum of two regular words.\n\nSuppose that we have found a collision, so we have Hash(''m''<sub>1</sub>) = Hash(''m''<sub>2</sub>) with <math>m_1\\neq m_2</math>. Then we can find two regular words <math>w_1</math> and <math>w_2</math> such that <math>Hw_1=Hw_2</math> . We then have <math>H(w_1+w_2)= Hw_1 + Hw_2 =2Hw_1=0</math>; <math>(w_1 + w_2)</math> is a sum of two different regular words and so must be a 2-regular word of which the hash is zero, so we have solved an instance of 2-RNSD. We conclude that finding collisions in FSB is at least as difficult as solving 2-RNSD and so must be NP-complete.\n\nThe latest versions of FSB use the compression function [[Whirlpool (cryptography)|Whirlpool]] to further compress the hash output. Though this cannot be proven, the authors argue that this last compression does not reduce security. Note that even if one were able to find collisions in Whirlpool, one would still need to find the collisions pre-images in the original FSB compression function to find a collision in FSB.\n\n===Examples===\nSolving RSD, we are in the opposite situation as when hashing. Using the same values as in the previous example, we are given <math>H</math> separated into <math>w=3</math> sub-blocks and a string <math>r = 1111</math>. We are asked to find in each sub-block exactly one column such that they would all sum to <math>r</math>. The expected answer is thus <math>s_1 = 1</math>, <math>s_2 = 0</math>, <math>s_3 = 3</math>. This is known to be hard to compute for large matrices.\n\nIn 2-RNSD we want to find in each sub-block not one column, but two or zero such that they would sum up to 0000 (and not to <math>r</math>). In the example, we might use column (counting from 0) 2 and 3 from <math>H_1</math>, no column from <math>H_2</math> column 0 and 2 from <math>H_3</math>. More solutions are possible, for example might use no columns from <math>H_3</math>.\n\n===Linear cryptanalysis===\nThe [[Provably secure cryptographic hash function|provable security]] of FSB means that finding collisions is NP-complete. But the proof is a reduction to a problem with asymptotically hard [[worst-case complexity]]. This offers only limited security assurance as there still can be an algorithm that easily solves the problem for a subset of the problem space. For example, there exists a [[Linear cryptanalysis|linearization]] method that can be used to produce collisions of in a matter of seconds on a desktop PC for early variants of FSB with claimed 2^128 security. It is shown that the hash function offers minimal pre-image or collision resistance when the message space is chosen in a specific way.\n\n===Practical security results===\nThe following table shows the complexity of the best known attacks against FSB.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Output size (bits)\n!Complexity of collision search\n!Complexity of inversion\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''160''' || 2<sup>100.3</sup> || 2<sup>163.6</sup> \n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''224''' || 2<sup>135.3</sup> || 2<sup>229.0</sup>\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''256''' || 2<sup>190.0</sup> || 2<sup>261.0</sup>\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''384''' || 2<sup>215.5</sup> || 2<sup>391.5</sup>\n|- align=\"center\"\n| '''512''' || 2<sup>285.6</sup> || 2<sup>527.4</sup>\n|}\n\n==Genesis==\nFSB is a speed-up version of syndrome-based hash function (SB). In the case of SB the compression function is very similar to the encoding function of [[Niederreiter cryptosystem|Niederreiter's version]] of [[McEliece cryptosystem]]. Instead of using the parity check matrix of a permuted [[Goppa code]], SB uses a random matrix <math>H</math>. From the security point of view this can only strengthen the system.\n\n==Other properties==\n* Both the block size of the hash function and the output size are completely scalable.\n* The speed can be adjusted by adjusting the number of bitwise operations used by FSB per input bit.\n* The security can be adjusted by adjusting the output size.\n* Bad instances exist and one must take care when choosing the matrix <math>H</math>.\n* The matrix used in the compression function may grow large in certain situations. This might be a limitation when trying to use FSB on memory constrained devices. This problem was solved in the related hash function called Improved FSB, which is still [[Provably secure cryptographic hash function|provably secure]], but relies on slightly stronger assumptions.\n\n==Variants==\nIn 2007, IFSB was published.<ref>https://www.rocq.inria.fr/secret/Matthieu.Finiasz/research/2007/finiasz-gaborit-sendrier-ecrypt-hash-workshop07.pdf</ref> In 2010, S-FSB was published, which is 30% faster than the original.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_CASED/Publikationen/2010/S-FSB_An_Improved_Variant_of_the_FSB_Hash_Family.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-12-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222135653/https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Group_CASED/Publikationen/2010/S-FSB_An_Improved_Variant_of_the_FSB_Hash_Family.pdf |archive-date=2015-12-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, [[D.

The first newspapers to adopt an online format were generally English speaking because they had more of a global audience. However, as more users gained access more Indian language papers began to surface. A lot of these new websites were generic versions of the daily paper and were not edited once published. They were operated by minimal staffs. In some instances a single editor would upload data to a third party pre-formatted interface which would allow stories to be published under general headings such as Local News, International, Sports, etc.  A large majority of online newspapers in India don\u2019t receive advertisement revenue for their web editions and, with the exception of the major papers, most websites are being operated at a loss.  Most publications have been slow to incorporate modern web features such as video clips or imbedded audio. One of the biggest concerns is economic viability due to lack of ad revenue.  Indian journalism sites have also been slow to adopt the modern practice of online purchasing. This means that when someone visits the website they are unable to order the paper directly or purchase products through advertisements.<ref name=\"essay\" />\n\n=== Criticism ===\n\nMany online newspapers in India are criticised for being hastily thrown together with little care from publishers about content.
