The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include [[insomnia]], [[dry mouth]], and [[loss of appetite]]. The risk of developing an [[addiction]] is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced [[reinforcement|reinforcing effects]] that are present at high doses. Recreational doses of amphetamine are generally much larger than prescribed [[therapeutic dose]]s, and carry a far greater risk of serious adverse effects.{{#tag:ref|<ref name=\"Libido\" /><ref name=\"Adderall IR\" /><ref name=\"Malenka_2009\" /><ref name=\"Ergogenics\" /><ref name=\"FDA\" /><ref name=\"Cochrane\" /><ref name=\"Stimulant Misuse\" /><ref name=\"NHMH_3e-Addiction doses\" /><ref name=\"Addiction risk\" /><ref name=\"EncycOfPsychopharm\">{{Cite book | author = Stolerman IP | editor = Stolerman IP | title = Encyclopedia of Psychopharmacology | year = 2010 | publisher = Springer | location = Berlin, Germany; London, England | isbn = 9783540686989 | page = 78}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Howell|first=L|title=Monoamine transporters and psychostimulant addiction|url=|journal=Biochemical Pharmacology|volume=75|issue=1|pages=196\u2013217|pmid=17825265|year=2008|doi=10.1016/j.bcp.2007.08.003}}</ref>|group=\"sources\"}}\n\nThe two amphetamine enantiomers that compose Adderall (i.e., levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine) alleviate the symptoms of ADHD and narcolepsy by increasing the activity of the [[neurotransmitter]]s [[norepinephrine]] and [[dopamine]] in the [[human brain|brain]], which results in part from their interactions with [[human trace amine-associated receptor&nbsp;1]] (hTAAR1) and [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2) in [[neuron]]s.

At therapeutic doses, Adderall causes emotional and cognitive effects such as [[euphoria]], change in [[libido|desire for sex]], increased [[wakefulness]], and improved [[Executive functions|cognitive control]]. At these doses, it induces physical effects such as a faster reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. In contrast, much larger doses of Adderall can impair cognitive control, cause [[Rhabdomyolysis|rapid muscle breakdown]], or induce a [[Stimulant psychosis#Amphetamines|psychosis]] (e.g., delusions and paranoia). The side effects of Adderall vary widely among individuals, but most commonly include [[insomnia]], [[dry mouth]], and [[loss of appetite]]. The risk of developing an [[addiction]] is insignificant when Adderall is used as prescribed at fairly low daily doses, such as those used for treating ADHD; however, the routine use of Adderall in larger daily doses poses a significant risk of addiction due to the pronounced [[reinforcement|reinforcing effects]] that are present at high doses.

The system is an important part of the [[public transport in Stockholm]], and is controlled by [[Storstockholms Lokaltrafik]]. The tracks are state-owned and administered by the [[Swedish Transport Administration]], while the operation of the Stockholm commuter rail services itself has been contracted to [[MTR Nordic]] since December 2016.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sundbybergs station.jpg|thumbnail|An [[SL X60|X60]] train in Sundbyberg]]\nLocal trains have been operated on the mainline railways around Stockholm since the late nineteenth century. At the beginning, local rail services were part of the [[Statens J\u00e4rnv\u00e4gar|Swedish State Railways]], but in the late-1960s, the responsibility for these services was transferred to [[Stockholm County]], which incorporated it with the ticketing system of Stockholm Transport. New trains were bought, stations were modernised, and the Stockholm commuter rail network was developed with an aim of making it more metro-like. Originally the system was branded as ''SL f\u00f6rortst\u00e5g'' ({{lang-en|SL suburban train}}), and later as ''SL lokalt\u00e5g'' ({{lang-en|SL local/commuter train}}). Only in the 1980s did the system officially become known as ''Stockholms pendelt\u00e5g''.\n\nIn its first year of operation there was only one route which went from S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje s\u00f6dra (now [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje Hamn railway station|S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje Hamn]]) to [[Kungs\u00e4ngen]] via [[Stockholm Central Station]]. On 1 June 1969, the system was extended to [[M\u00e4rsta]] via a branch located after [[Karlberg Station]] <small>([[:sv:Karlbergs station|sv]])</small> and a new service was created in which trains on the Kungs\u00e4ngen branch terminated at Stockholm C instead. In 1975 another branch line opened to [[V\u00e4sterhaninge]], with a single-track shuttle service to [[Nyn\u00e4shamn]]. Trains on the Kungs\u00e4ngen branch now terminated at V\u00e4sterhaninge instead of Stockholm C and which now forms part of the modern line 35.\n\nFrom 1986 until 1996, important improvements were made to the railways around Stockholm. Single-track stretches were upgraded to double tracks, and some double-track stretches were upgraded to four-track, allowing the commuter trains to run with less interference from other rail services. The service frequency was gradually increased, and from 2001 most stations on the network are served by trains at regular 15-minute intervals, with additional trains during rush hours.\n\nIn 2001, the northwestern arm of the network was extended from [[Kungs\u00e4ngen]] to [[B\u00e5lsta]]. A southern infill station at [[\u00c5rstaberg]] was inaugurated in 2006, in order to connect with the then new [[Tv\u00e4rbanan]] [[light rail]] system. A new station at [[Gr\u00f6ndalsviken]] opened on the southeastern V\u00e4sterhaninge-Nyn\u00e4shamn shuttle on 18 August 2008.\n\nSince 9 December 2012, it has been possible for Stockholm commuter rail trains to stop at [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport]]. Journeys take 38 minutes from Arlanda C station to Stockholm C, and 18 minutes from Arlanda C to Uppsala C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sl.se/sv/Om-SL/Nyheter/Ny-pendeltagslinje-till-Arlanda-och-Uppsala-startar-pa-sondag/|title=Nu startar pendelt\u00e5gslinjen till Arlanda och Uppsala|publisher=[[Storstockholms Lokaltrafik]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908173136/http://sl.se/sv/Om-SL/Nyheter/Ny-pendeltagslinje-till-Arlanda-och-Uppsala-startar-pa-sondag/|archive-date=September 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swedavia.com/arlanda/about-stockholm-arlanda-airport-/about-stockholm-arlanda-airport/news/commuter-rail-service-now-available-at-stockholm-arlanda/|title=Commuter rail service now available at Stockholm Arlanda|publisher=[[Swedavia]]|date=December 7, 2012|access-date=January 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006100405/http://www.swedavia.com/arlanda/about-stockholm-arlanda-airport-/about-stockholm-arlanda-airport/news/commuter-rail-service-now-available-at-stockholm-arlanda/|archive-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> Discussions on the expansion began in December 2007.

This new tunnel, known as [[Stockholm City Line]] (''Citybanan''; lit. \u2018the city line\u2019), is intended for the exclusive use of the Pendelt\u00e5g system, and will split commuter traffic onto separate tracks from long-distance trains while travelling through the city. This would ease the rail systems' congestion problems, and permit Stockholm Transport to schedule more frequent service. It will also allow more frequent service for other trains, increasing the capacity for large parts of the Swedish rail network since many trains go to and from Stockholm. Two new underground stations, [[Stockholm City Station]] (located under [[T-Centralen]], both stations with connections to Stockholm Central Station) and [[Stockholm Odenplan Station]] ([[:sv:Odenplan (pendelt\u00e5gsstation)|sv]]; located under [[Odenplan metro station]], replacing [[Karlberg Station]]) were built as part of the Citybanan project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trafikverket.se/nara-dig/Stockholm/projekt-i-stockholms-lan/Citybanan/Om-projektet/|title= Om Citybanan|accessdate=2017-03-24|publisher= [[Swedish Transport Administration]]|language= Swedish}}</ref>\n\nA new station called [[Vega Station|Vega]] <small>([[:sv:Vega (pendelt\u00e5gsstation)|sv]])</small>, located on the [[Nyn\u00e4s Line]] in [[Haninge Municipality]] between Skog\u00e5s and Handen stations, opened on 1 April 2019 after almost four years of construction. Vega was also the name of a small halt on the Nyn\u00e4s Line which existed between 1929 and 1973, although it was built at a different location from the current Vega station.\n\nOperation of the Stockholm commuter rail lines has been contracted to private companies since 2000. The first franchise holder was [[Citypendeln]] <small>([[:sv:Citypendeln|sv]])</small>, which operated the Stockholm commuter rail from 2000 until 17 June 2006. From 18 June 2006 until 10 December 2016, the network was operated by [[Stockholmst\u00e5g]] <small>([[:sv:Stockholmst\u00e5g|sv]])</small>, a subsidiary of [[SJ AB]], the [[Statens J\u00e4rnv\u00e4gar|former Swedish State Railways company]].

On top of this, some trains are from this time quick skip-stop trains, 42X and 43X (named with an X after the line number), which skip around four stops per tour.\n\nThe shorter line 48 in the southwest connects [[Gnesta]] to [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]]. Line 40 connects [[Uppsala Central Station|Uppsala C]] in the north to [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]] in the southwest via [[Arlanda Central Station|Arlanda C]], Upplands V\u00e4sby and [[Stockholm City Station]], this branch from Uppsala C to [[Upplands V\u00e4sby]] (where it joins line 41 to S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje) used by Line 40 utilises the existing infrastructure of the [[Arlanda Line]] and a part of the [[East Coast Line (Sweden)|East Coast Line]] sharing tracks and platforms with regional and long distance trains.\n\nThe line to Nyn\u00e4shamn beyond V\u00e4sterhaninge is mostly single track with passing loops. Previously, short platforms and limited passing places meant that a change of train had to be made in V\u00e4sterhaninge, but as of 2013 the line has been improved with longer platforms and additional loops, and all services are now run through to Stockholm and B\u00e5lsta.\n\nTrains operate every 30 minutes from 5 am to 1 am every day, with 15-minute intervals during the daytime. Additional trains during rush hours give an average of 7\u00bd minutes intervals for many stations, and trains every 4\u00bd minutes on the central parts. Line 40, 48 and the outer parts of the railway to Nyn\u00e4shamn (from V\u00e4sterhaninge) are served less frequently, with up to one hour between trains on weekends.\n\n390,000 passengers use Stockholm commuter trains on an ordinary weekday (counting connecting passengers double). This is almost half of the total number of train passengers in Sweden, the metro and trams not included.{{citation needed|reason=Number of users, proportion of national total|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Stations==\nThere are 53 stations in the network, four of which are beyond the borders of Stockholm County. Eight stations connect with regional and long-distance trains, three connect with the [[light rail|light-rail]] tram system [[Tv\u00e4rbanan]], and four stations have access to the [[Stockholm metro]]. Several stations are important interchanges to local buses.\n\nMost stations are of a similar style, with an [[island platform]] in a ground-level location with one or two exits, [[turnstile]]s, and a staffed ticket office. A few interchange stations have multiple platforms. The stations south of [[V\u00e4sterhaninge]] and [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]] are smaller, and have no ticket vending facilities; passengers buy their tickets from the train conductor on these parts of the network. The smallest station is Hemfosa, which has approximately 100 boarding passengers per day.\n\n[[Image:Stockholm commuter rail symbol.svg|30px|left|Stockholm commuter rail logo]]The stations are marked with a J symbol, which just stands for the generic term \"j\u00e4rnv\u00e4gsstation\" (i.e. railway station) and is similar to the T symbol used by the Stockholm underground railway stations (\"tunnelbanestation\").\n\n==Rolling stock==\n[[Image:Nedisat Pendelt\u00e5g.jpg|thumb|An ice covered X1 train]]\nSince the opening of the [[Stockholm City Line]] (Citybanan) on 10 July 2017, only one train type, the [[SL X60|X60]] ''Coradia Nordic'' trains from [[Alstom]] is currently used on the network, due to the use of [[platform screen doors]] on the Citybanan.

The system is an important part of the [[public transport in Stockholm]], and is controlled by [[Storstockholms Lokaltrafik]]. The tracks are state-owned and administered by the [[Swedish Transport Administration]], while the operation of the Stockholm commuter rail services itself has been contracted to [[MTR Nordic]] since December 2016.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sundbybergs station.jpg|thumbnail|An [[SL X60|X60]] train in Sundbyberg]]\nLocal trains have been operated on the mainline railways around Stockholm since the late nineteenth century. At the beginning, local rail services were part of the [[Statens J\u00e4rnv\u00e4gar|Swedish State Railways]], but in the late-1960s, the responsibility for these services was transferred to [[Stockholm County]], which incorporated it with the ticketing system of Stockholm Transport. New trains were bought, stations were modernised, and the Stockholm commuter rail network was developed with an aim of making it more metro-like. Originally the system was branded as ''SL f\u00f6rortst\u00e5g'' ({{lang-en|SL suburban train}}), and later as ''SL lokalt\u00e5g'' ({{lang-en|SL local/commuter train}}). Only in the 1980s did the system officially become known as ''Stockholms pendelt\u00e5g''.\n\nIn its first year of operation there was only one route which went from S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje s\u00f6dra (now [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje Hamn railway station|S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje Hamn]]) to [[Kungs\u00e4ngen]] via [[Stockholm Central Station]]. On 1 June 1969, the system was extended to [[M\u00e4rsta]] via a branch located after [[Karlberg Station]] <small>([[:sv:Karlbergs station|sv]])</small> and a new service was created in which trains on the Kungs\u00e4ngen branch terminated at Stockholm C instead. In 1975 another branch line opened to [[V\u00e4sterhaninge]], with a single-track shuttle service to [[Nyn\u00e4shamn]]. Trains on the Kungs\u00e4ngen branch now terminated at V\u00e4sterhaninge instead of Stockholm C and which now forms part of the modern line 35.\n\nFrom 1986 until 1996, important improvements were made to the railways around Stockholm. Single-track stretches were upgraded to double tracks, and some double-track stretches were upgraded to four-track, allowing the commuter trains to run with less interference from other rail services. The service frequency was gradually increased, and from 2001 most stations on the network are served by trains at regular 15-minute intervals, with additional trains during rush hours.\n\nIn 2001, the northwestern arm of the network was extended from [[Kungs\u00e4ngen]] to [[B\u00e5lsta]]. A southern infill station at [[\u00c5rstaberg]] was inaugurated in 2006, in order to connect with the then new [[Tv\u00e4rbanan]] [[light rail]] system. A new station at [[Gr\u00f6ndalsviken]] opened on the southeastern V\u00e4sterhaninge-Nyn\u00e4shamn shuttle on 18 August 2008.\n\nSince 9 December 2012, it has been possible for Stockholm commuter rail trains to stop at [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport]]. Journeys take 38 minutes from Arlanda C station to Stockholm C, and 18 minutes from Arlanda C to Uppsala C.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sl.se/sv/Om-SL/Nyheter/Ny-pendeltagslinje-till-Arlanda-och-Uppsala-startar-pa-sondag/|title=Nu startar pendelt\u00e5gslinjen till Arlanda och Uppsala|publisher=[[Storstockholms Lokaltrafik]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908173136/http://sl.se/sv/Om-SL/Nyheter/Ny-pendeltagslinje-till-Arlanda-och-Uppsala-startar-pa-sondag/|archive-date=September 8, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swedavia.com/arlanda/about-stockholm-arlanda-airport-/about-stockholm-arlanda-airport/news/commuter-rail-service-now-available-at-stockholm-arlanda/|title=Commuter rail service now available at Stockholm Arlanda|publisher=[[Swedavia]]|date=December 7, 2012|access-date=January 20, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006100405/http://www.swedavia.com/arlanda/about-stockholm-arlanda-airport-/about-stockholm-arlanda-airport/news/commuter-rail-service-now-available-at-stockholm-arlanda/|archive-date=October 6, 2014}}</ref> Discussions on the expansion began in December 2007. The airport has had express service from Stockholm Central through [[Arlanda Express]] since 1999, and was also reachable by bus from [[M\u00e4rsta]] station.

This new tunnel, known as [[Stockholm City Line]] (''Citybanan''; lit. \u2018the city line\u2019), is intended for the exclusive use of the Pendelt\u00e5g system, and will split commuter traffic onto separate tracks from long-distance trains while travelling through the city. This would ease the rail systems' congestion problems, and permit Stockholm Transport to schedule more frequent service. It will also allow more frequent service for other trains, increasing the capacity for large parts of the Swedish rail network since many trains go to and from Stockholm. Two new underground stations, [[Stockholm City Station]] (located under [[T-Centralen]], both stations with connections to Stockholm Central Station) and [[Stockholm Odenplan Station]] ([[:sv:Odenplan (pendelt\u00e5gsstation)|sv]]; located under [[Odenplan metro station]], replacing [[Karlberg Station]]) were built as part of the Citybanan project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trafikverket.se/nara-dig/Stockholm/projekt-i-stockholms-lan/Citybanan/Om-projektet/|title= Om Citybanan|accessdate=2017-03-24|publisher= [[Swedish Transport Administration]]|language= Swedish}}</ref>\n\nA new station called [[Vega Station|Vega]] <small>([[:sv:Vega (pendelt\u00e5gsstation)|sv]])</small>, located on the [[Nyn\u00e4s Line]] in [[Haninge Municipality]] between Skog\u00e5s and Handen stations, opened on 1 April 2019 after almost four years of construction. Vega was also the name of a small halt on the Nyn\u00e4s Line which existed between 1929 and 1973, although it was built at a different location from the current Vega station.\n\nOperation of the Stockholm commuter rail lines has been contracted to private companies since 2000. The first franchise holder was [[Citypendeln]] <small>([[:sv:Citypendeln|sv]])</small>, which operated the Stockholm commuter rail from 2000 until 17 June 2006. From 18 June 2006 until 10 December 2016, the network was operated by [[Stockholmst\u00e5g]] <small>([[:sv:Stockholmst\u00e5g|sv]])</small>, a subsidiary of [[SJ AB]], the [[Statens J\u00e4rnv\u00e4gar|former Swedish State Railways company]].

On top of this, some trains are from this time quick skip-stop trains, 42X and 43X (named with an X after the line number), which skip around four stops per tour.\n\nThe shorter line 48 in the southwest connects [[Gnesta]] to [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]]. Line 40 connects [[Uppsala Central Station|Uppsala C]] in the north to [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]] in the southwest via [[Arlanda Central Station|Arlanda C]], Upplands V\u00e4sby and [[Stockholm City Station]], this branch from Uppsala C to [[Upplands V\u00e4sby]] (where it joins line 41 to S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje) used by Line 40 utilises the existing infrastructure of the [[Arlanda Line]] and a part of the [[East Coast Line (Sweden)|East Coast Line]] sharing tracks and platforms with regional and long distance trains.\n\nThe line to Nyn\u00e4shamn beyond V\u00e4sterhaninge is mostly single track with passing loops. Previously, short platforms and limited passing places meant that a change of train had to be made in V\u00e4sterhaninge, but as of 2013 the line has been improved with longer platforms and additional loops, and all services are now run through to Stockholm and B\u00e5lsta.\n\nTrains operate every 30 minutes from 5 am to 1 am every day, with 15-minute intervals during the daytime. Additional trains during rush hours give an average of 7\u00bd minutes intervals for many stations, and trains every 4\u00bd minutes on the central parts. Line 40, 48 and the outer parts of the railway to Nyn\u00e4shamn (from V\u00e4sterhaninge) are served less frequently, with up to one hour between trains on weekends.\n\n390,000 passengers use Stockholm commuter trains on an ordinary weekday (counting connecting passengers double). This is almost half of the total number of train passengers in Sweden, the metro and trams not included.{{citation needed|reason=Number of users, proportion of national total|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Stations==\nThere are 53 stations in the network, four of which are beyond the borders of Stockholm County. Eight stations connect with regional and long-distance trains, three connect with the [[light rail|light-rail]] tram system [[Tv\u00e4rbanan]], and four stations have access to the [[Stockholm metro]]. Several stations are important interchanges to local buses.\n\nMost stations are of a similar style, with an [[island platform]] in a ground-level location with one or two exits, [[turnstile]]s, and a staffed ticket office. A few interchange stations have multiple platforms. The stations south of [[V\u00e4sterhaninge]] and [[S\u00f6dert\u00e4lje]] are smaller, and have no ticket vending facilities; passengers buy their tickets from the train conductor on these parts of the network. The smallest station is Hemfosa, which has approximately 100 boarding passengers per day.\n\n[[Image:Stockholm commuter rail symbol.svg|30px|left|Stockholm commuter rail logo]]The stations are marked with a J symbol, which just stands for the generic term \"j\u00e4rnv\u00e4gsstation\" (i.e. railway station) and is similar to the T symbol used by the Stockholm underground railway stations (\"tunnelbanestation\").\n\n==Rolling stock==\n[[Image:Nedisat Pendelt\u00e5g.jpg|thumb|An ice covered X1 train]]\nSince the opening of the [[Stockholm City Line]] (Citybanan) on 10 July 2017, only one train type, the [[SL X60|X60]] ''Coradia Nordic'' trains from [[Alstom]] is currently used on the network, due to the use of [[platform screen doors]] on the Citybanan.
