While not attempting a strict definition of the good life, positive psychologists agree that one must live a [[Happiness|happy]], engaged, and meaningful life in order to experience \"the good life\". [[Martin Seligman]] referred to \"the good life\" as \"using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic [[happiness]] and abundant gratification\".{{sfn|Seligman|2002|p=13}} \n\n[https://spritofpen.blogspot.com/2020/04/how-to-change-your-life.html '''Positive psycholog]y''' complements, without intending to replace or ignore, the traditional areas of [[psychology]]. By emphasizing the study of positive human development this field helps to balance other approaches that focus on disorder, and which may produce only limited understanding.{{sfn|Peterson|2009}} Positive psychology has also placed a significant emphasis on fostering positive self-esteem and self-image, though positive psychologists with a less humanist bent are less likely to focus as intently on the matter. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mruk|first1=Christopher|title=The Psychology of Self-Esteem: A Potential Common Ground for Humanistic Positive Psychology and Positivistic Positive Psychology|journal=The Humanistic Psychologist|date=April 2008|volume=36|issue=2|pages=143\u2013158|doi=10.1080/08873260802111176|id={{ProQuest|212086932}}}}</ref>\n\nThe basic premise of positive psychology is that human beings are often drawn by the future more than they are driven by the past. A change in our orientation to time can dramatically affect how we think about the nature of happiness.

That being noted, accomplishments can activate the other elements of PERMA, such as pride, under positive emotion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awesomeculture.com/2011/09/13/the-science-of-a-happy-startup/|title=The Science of a Happy Startup}}</ref> Accomplishments can be individual or community-based, fun- or work-based.\n\nEach of the five PERMA elements was selected according to three criteria:\n# It contributes to well-being.\n# It is pursued for its own sake.\n# It is defined and measured independently of the other elements.\n\n===''Character  Strengths and Virtues''===\n{{main|Character Strengths and Virtues}}\n{{also|Character education|Values education|Values in Action Inventory of Strengths}}\n\nThe development of the ''[[Character Strengths and Virtues (book)|Character Strengths and Virtues]]'' (CSV) handbook (2004) represented the first attempt by Seligman and Peterson to identify and classify positive psychological traits of human beings. Much like the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) of general psychology, the CSV provided a theoretical framework to assist in understanding strengths and virtues and for developing practical applications for positive psychology. This manual identified 6 classes of [[virtues]] (i.e., \"core virtues\"), underlying 24 measurable character strengths.{{sfn|Peterson|Seligman|2004}}\n\nThe CSV suggested these 6 virtues have a historical basis in the vast majority of cultures; in addition, these virtues and strengths can lead to increased happiness when built upon. Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality hints threefold: 1. The study of positive human qualities broadens the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness, 2. the leaders of the positive psychology movement are challenging [[moral relativism]], suggesting people are \"evolutionarily predisposed\" toward certain virtues, and 3. virtue has a biological basis.{{sfn|Peterson|Seligman|2004|p=51}}\n\nThe organization of the 6 virtues and 24 strengths is as follows:\n# '''[[Wisdom]] and knowledge:''' [[creativity]], [[curiosity]], [[Toleration|open-mindedness]], [[love of learning]], [[wisdom|perspective]], [[innovation]]\n# '''Courage:''' [[bravery]], [[persistence (psychology)|persistence]], [[integrity]], [[vitality]], [[Zest (positive psychology)|zest]]\n# '''Humanity:''' [[love]], [[kindness]], [[social intelligence]]\n# '''Justice:''' [[active citizenship|citizenship]], fairness, [[leadership]]\n# '''Temperance:''' [[forgiveness]] and [[mercy]], [[humility]], [[prudence]], [[self-control|self control]]\n# '''Transcendence:''' [[appreciation of beauty]] and [[excellence]], [[gratitude]], [[hope]], [[humor]], [[spirituality]]\n\nRecent research challenged the need for 6 virtues. Instead, researchers suggested the 24 strengths are more accurately grouped into just 3 or 4 categories: Intellectual Strengths, Interpersonal Strengths, and Temperance Strengths<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Shryack | first1 = J. | last2 = Steger | first2 = M.

Flow is characterized by intense concentration, loss of self-awareness, a feeling of being perfectly challenged (neither bored nor overwhelmed), and a sense that \"time is flying\". Flow is intrinsically rewarding; it can also assist in the achievement of goals (e.g., winning a game) or improving skills (e.g., becoming a better chess player).<ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990>{{Cite book | last1 = Csikszentmihalyi | first1 = Mihaly | title = Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience | year = 1990 | publisher = Harper & Row | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-06-016253-5 }}</ref> Anyone can experience flow, in different domains, such as play, creativity, and work. Flow is achieved when the challenge of the situation meets one's personal abilities.

Wellbeing is related to optimism, extraversion, social connections (i.e. close friendships), being married, having engaging work, religion or spirituality, leisure, good sleep and exercise, social class (through lifestyle differences and better coping methods) and subjective health (what you think about your health). Wellbeing is not related to age, physical attractiveness, money (once basic needs are met), gender (women are more often depressed but also more often joyful), educational level, having children (although they add meaning to life), moving to a sunnier climate, crime prevention, housing and objective health (what doctors say).<ref>Positive Psychology in a Nutshell, Ilona Boniwell, Open University Press, 2012, p.44</ref>\n\n[[Sonja Lyubomirsky]], in her book ''The How Of Happiness'', says that to improve happiness individuals should create new habits; they can seek out new emotions, use variety and timing to prevent hedonic adaptation and enlist others to motivate and support during the creation of those new habits.<ref>The How of Happiness, Sonja Lyubomirsky, 2007, Piatkus, p.270-p.294</ref> Lyubomirsky gives 12 happiness activities such as savouring life, learning to forgive and living in the present, each of which could become the basis for a new habit.\n\nIn ''Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness'', the authors Compton and Hoffman give the \"Top Down Predictors\" of wellbeing as high [[self esteem]], [[optimism]], [[self efficacy]], a sense of meaning in life and positive relationships with others.

They make the case that TBI rehabilitation practices rely on the betterment of the individual through engaging in everyday practices, a practice significantly related to tenets of positive psychology.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}} Their proposal to connect positive psychology with TBI vocational rehabilitation (VR) also looks at happiness and its correlation with improvements in mental health, including increased confidence and productivity, as well as others.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}} While the authors point out that empirical evidence for positive psychology is limited, they clarify that positive psychology's focus on small successes, optimism and prosocial behaviour is promising for improvements in the social and emotional well-being of TBI patients.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}}\n\n==Criticism==\n[[Kirk J. Schneider|Kirk Schneider]], editor of the [[Journal of Humanistic Psychology]], says positive psychology fails to explain past heinous behaviors such as those perpetrated by the Nazi party, Stalinist marches and Klan gatherings, to identify but a few.

By contrast, negativity, sometimes evidenced in mild to moderate depression, is correlated with less distortion of reality.

Held]], a professor at [[Bowdoin College]], argued that while positive psychology makes contributions to the field of psychology, it has its faults. She offered insight into topics including the negative side effects of positive psychology, negativity within the positive psychology movement, and the current division in the field of psychology caused by differing opinions of psychologists on positive psychology. In addition, she noted the movement's lack of consistency regarding the role of negativity. She also raised issues with the simplistic approach taken by some psychologists in the application of positive psychology. A \"one size fits all\" approach is arguably not beneficial to the advancement of the field of positive psychology; she suggested a need for individual differences to be incorporated into its application.{{sfn|Held|2004}}\n\n[[Martin Jack]] has also maintained that positive psychology is not unique in its optimistic approach to looking at optimal emotional wellbeing, stating that other forms of psychology, such as counselling and educational psychology, are also interested in positive human fulfillment.

While not attempting a strict definition of the good life, positive psychologists agree that one must live a [[Happiness|happy]], engaged, and meaningful life in order to experience \"the good life\". [[Martin Seligman]] referred to \"the good life\" as \"using your signature strengths every day to produce authentic [[happiness]] and abundant gratification\".{{sfn|Seligman|2002|p=13}} \n\nPositive psychology complements, without intending to replace or ignore, the traditional areas of [[psychology]]. By emphasizing the study of positive human development this field helps to balance other approaches that focus on disorder, and which may produce only limited understanding.{{sfn|Peterson|2009}} Positive psychology has also placed a significant emphasis on fostering positive self-esteem and self-image, though positive psychologists with a less humanist bent are less likely to focus as intently on the matter. <ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mruk|first1=Christopher|title=The Psychology of Self-Esteem: A Potential Common Ground for Humanistic Positive Psychology and Positivistic Positive Psychology|journal=The Humanistic Psychologist|date=April 2008|volume=36|issue=2|pages=143\u2013158|doi=10.1080/08873260802111176|id={{ProQuest|212086932}}}}</ref>\n\nThe basic premise of positive psychology is that human beings are often drawn by the future more than they are driven by the past. A change in our orientation to time can dramatically affect how we think about the nature of happiness. Seligman identified other possible goals: families and schools that allow children to grow, workplaces that aim for satisfaction and high productivity, and teaching others about positive psychology.<ref name=\"SeligmanMartin\">Seligman, Martin E.P. \"Positive Psychology Center.\" Positive Psychology Center.

Much like the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM) of general psychology, the CSV provided a theoretical framework to assist in understanding strengths and virtues and for developing practical applications for positive psychology. This manual identified 6 classes of [[virtues]] (i.e., \"core virtues\"), underlying 24 measurable character strengths.{{sfn|Peterson|Seligman|2004}}\n\nThe CSV suggested these 6 virtues have a historical basis in the vast majority of cultures; in addition, these virtues and strengths can lead to increased happiness when built upon. Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality hints threefold: 1. The study of positive human qualities broadens the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness, 2. the leaders of the positive psychology movement are challenging [[moral relativism]], suggesting people are \"evolutionarily predisposed\" toward certain virtues, and 3. virtue has a biological basis.{{sfn|Peterson|Seligman|2004|p=51}}\n\nThe organization of the 6 virtues and 24 strengths is as follows:\n# '''[[Wisdom]] and knowledge:''' [[creativity]], [[curiosity]], [[Toleration|open-mindedness]], [[love of learning]], [[wisdom|perspective]], [[innovation]]\n# '''Courage:''' [[bravery]], [[persistence (psychology)|persistence]], [[integrity]], [[vitality]], [[Zest (positive psychology)|zest]]\n# '''Humanity:''' [[love]], [[kindness]], [[social intelligence]]\n# '''Justice:''' [[active citizenship|citizenship]], fairness, [[leadership]]\n# '''Temperance:''' [[forgiveness]] and [[mercy]], [[humility]], [[prudence]], [[self-control|self control]]\n# '''Transcendence:''' [[appreciation of beauty]] and [[excellence]], [[gratitude]], [[hope]], [[humor]], [[spirituality]]\n\nRecent research challenged the need for 6 virtues. Instead, researchers suggested the 24 strengths are more accurately grouped into just 3 or 4 categories: Intellectual Strengths, Interpersonal Strengths, and Temperance Strengths<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Shryack | first1 = J. | last2 = Steger | first2 = M.

Flow is characterized by intense concentration, loss of self-awareness, a feeling of being perfectly challenged (neither bored nor overwhelmed), and a sense that \"time is flying\". Flow is intrinsically rewarding; it can also assist in the achievement of goals (e.g., winning a game) or improving skills (e.g., becoming a better chess player).<ref name=Csikszentmihalyi1990>{{Cite book | last1 = Csikszentmihalyi | first1 = Mihaly | title = Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience | year = 1990 | publisher = Harper & Row | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-06-016253-5 }}</ref> Anyone can experience flow, in different domains, such as play, creativity, and work.

Wellbeing is related to optimism, extraversion, social connections (i.e. close friendships), being married, having engaging work, religion or spirituality, leisure, good sleep and exercise, social class (through lifestyle differences and better coping methods) and subjective health (what you think about your health). Wellbeing is not related to age, physical attractiveness, money (once basic needs are met), gender (women are more often depressed but also more often joyful), educational level, having children (although they add meaning to life), moving to a sunnier climate, crime prevention, housing and objective health (what doctors say).<ref>Positive Psychology in a Nutshell, Ilona Boniwell, Open University Press, 2012, p.44</ref>\n\n[[Sonja Lyubomirsky]], in her book ''The How Of Happiness'', says that to improve happiness individuals should create new habits; they can seek out new emotions, use variety and timing to prevent hedonic adaptation and enlist others to motivate and support during the creation of those new habits.<ref>The How of Happiness, Sonja Lyubomirsky, 2007, Piatkus, p.270-p.294</ref> Lyubomirsky gives 12 happiness activities such as savouring life, learning to forgive and living in the present, each of which could become the basis for a new habit.\n\nIn ''Positive Psychology: The Science of Happiness'', the authors Compton and Hoffman give the \"Top Down Predictors\" of wellbeing as high [[self esteem]], [[optimism]], [[self efficacy]], a sense of meaning in life and positive relationships with others.

They make the case that TBI rehabilitation practices rely on the betterment of the individual through engaging in everyday practices, a practice significantly related to tenets of positive psychology.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}} Their proposal to connect positive psychology with TBI vocational rehabilitation (VR) also looks at happiness and its correlation with improvements in mental health, including increased confidence and productivity, as well as others.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}} While the authors point out that empirical evidence for positive psychology is limited, they clarify that positive psychology's focus on small successes, optimism and prosocial behaviour is promising for improvements in the social and emotional well-being of TBI patients.{{sfn|Mills|Kreutzer|2016}}\n\n==Criticism==\n[[Kirk J. Schneider|Kirk Schneider]], editor of the [[Journal of Humanistic Psychology]], says positive psychology fails to explain past heinous behaviors such as those perpetrated by the Nazi party, Stalinist marches and Klan gatherings, to identify but a few.

In addition, she noted the movement's lack of consistency regarding the role of negativity. She also raised issues with the simplistic approach taken by some psychologists in the application of positive psychology. A \"one size fits all\" approach is arguably not beneficial to the advancement of the field of positive psychology; she suggested a need for individual differences to be incorporated into its application.{{sfn|Held|2004}}\n\n[[Martin Jack]] has also maintained that positive psychology is not unique in its optimistic approach to looking at optimal emotional wellbeing, stating that other forms of psychology, such as counselling and educational psychology, are also interested in positive human fulfillment.

{"title_page": "MPEG-4", "text_new": "'''MPEG-4''' is a method of defining [[Video compression|compression]] of audio and visual (AV) digital data.  It was introduced in late 1998 and designated a [[standardization|standard]] for a group of [[sound|audio]] and [[video coding]] formats and related technology agreed upon by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] (MPEG) ([[ISO/IEC JTC1]]/SC29/WG11) under the formal standard ISO/IEC 14496&nbsp;\u2013 ''Coding of audio-visual objects''. Uses of MPEG-4 include compression of AV data for web ([[streaming media]]) and [[Compact disc|CD]] distribution, voice ([[telephone]], [[videophone]]) and [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[television]] applications. The MPEG-4 standard was developed by a group led by Touradj Ebrahimi (later the [[Joint Photographic Experts Group|JPEG]] president) and Fernando Pereira.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ebrahimi |first1=Touradj |last2=Pereira |first2=Fernando |title=The MPEG-4 Book |date=2002 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall Professional]] |isbn=9780130616210 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftRvA08WcM4C}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nMPEG-4 absorbs many of the features of [[MPEG-1]] and [[MPEG-2]] and other related standards, adding new features such as (extended) [[VRML]] support for 3D rendering, object-oriented composite files (including audio, video and VRML objects), support for externally specified [[Digital Rights Management]] and various types of interactivity. [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)]] was standardized as an adjunct to MPEG-2 (as Part 7) before MPEG-4 was issued.\n\nMPEG-4 is still an evolving standard and is divided into a number of parts. Companies promoting MPEG-4 compatibility do not always clearly state which \"part\" level compatibility they are referring to. The key parts to be aware of are [[MPEG-4 Part 2]] (including Advanced Simple Profile, used by codecs such as [[DivX]], [[Xvid]], [[Nero Digital]] and [[3ivx]] and by [[QuickTime]] 6) and [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|MPEG-4 part 10]] (MPEG-4 AVC/[[H.264]] or Advanced Video Coding, used by the [[x264]] encoder, Nero Digital AVC, QuickTime 7, and [[high-definition video]] media like [[Blu-ray Disc]]).\n\nMost of the features included in MPEG-4 are left to individual developers to decide whether or not to implement. This means that there are probably no complete implementations of the entire MPEG-4 set of standards. To deal with this, the standard includes the concept of \"profiles\" and \"levels\", allowing a specific set of capabilities to be defined in a manner appropriate for a subset of applications.\n\nInitially, MPEG-4 was aimed primarily at low [[bit-rate]] video communications; however, its scope as a multimedia coding standard was later expanded. MPEG-4 is efficient across a variety of bit-rates ranging from a few kilobits per second to tens of megabits per second. MPEG-4 provides the following functions:\n* Improved coding efficiency over MPEG-2<ref>{{cite document |last1=Wiegand |first1=T |last2=Sullican |first2=G J |last3=Bjontegaard |first3=G |last4=Luthra |first4=A |title=Overview of the H.264/AVC video coding standard - IEEE Journals & Magazine |doi=10.1109/TCSVT.2003.815165 }}</ref>\n* Ability to encode mixed media data (video, audio, speech)\n* Error resilience to enable robust transmission\n* Ability to interact with the audio-visual scene generated at the receiver\n\n==Overview==\nMPEG-4 provides a series of technologies for developers, for various service-providers and for end users:\n\n* MPEG-4 enables different software and hardware developers to create multimedia objects possessing better abilities of adaptability and flexibility to improve the quality of such services and technologies as digital television, [[animation]] graphics, the World Wide Web and their extensions.\n* Data network providers can use MPEG-4 for data transparency. With the help of standard procedures, MPEG-4 data can be interpreted and transformed into other signal types compatible with any available network.\n* The MPEG-4 format provides end users with a wide range of interaction with various animated objects.\n* Standardized [[Digital Rights Management]] signaling, otherwise known in the MPEG community as Intellectual Property Management and Protection (IPMP).\n\nThe MPEG-4 format can perform various functions, among which might be the following:\n\n* [[Multiplexing|Multiplexes]] and [[Synchronization|synchronizes]] data, associated with media objects, in such a way that they can be efficiently transported further via network channels.\n* Interaction with the audio-visual scene, which is formed on the side of the receiver.\n\n===Profiles and Levels===\nMPEG-4 provides a large and rich set of tools for encoding.\nSubsets of the MPEG-4 tool sets have been provided for use in specific applications.\nThese subsets, called 'Profiles', limit the size of the tool set a decoder is required to implement.<ref name=\"rfc3640-31\"/> In order to restrict computational complexity, one or more 'Levels' are set for each Profile.<ref name=\"rfc3640-31\"/> A Profile and Level combination allows:<ref name=\"rfc3640-31\">{{citation | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3640#page-31 | title = RFC 3640 | page = 31 | publisher = IETF}}.</ref>\n* A codec builder to implement only the subset of the standard needed, while maintaining interworking with other MPEG-4 devices that implement the same combination.<ref name=\"rfc3640-31\"/>\n* Checking whether MPEG-4 devices comply with the standard, referred to as [[conformance testing]].<ref name=\"rfc3640-31\"/>\n\n==MPEG-4 Parts==\nMPEG-4 consists of several standards\u2014termed \"parts\"\u2014including the following (each part covers a certain aspect of the whole specification):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n|+MPEG-4 parts<ref name=\"mpeg-standards\">{{Cite web|url=http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards.htm |title=MPEG standards&nbsp;\u2013 Full list of standards developed or under development |author=MPEG |publisher=Chiariglione |accessdate=2010-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420192552/http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards.htm |archivedate=2010-04-20 }}</ref><ref name=\"jtc1-sc29\">{{Cite web|url=http://kikaku.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc29/29w42911.htm#MPEG-4 |title=Programme of Work&nbsp;\u2013 MPEG-4 (Coding of audio-visual objects) |author=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29 |date=2009-11-09 |accessdate=2009-11-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231054907/http://kikaku.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc29/29w42911.htm |archivedate=2013-12-31 }}</ref>\n|-\n! width=\"8%\" | Part\n! width=\"15%\" | Number\n! width=\"6%\" | First public release date (first edition)\n! width=\"6%\" | Latest public release date (last edition)\n! width=\"6%\" | Latest amendment\n! width=\"20%\" | Title\n!

It was introduced in late 1998 and designated a [[standardization|standard]] for a group of [[sound|audio]] and [[video coding]] formats and related technology agreed upon by the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] (MPEG) ([[ISO/IEC JTC1]]/SC29/WG11) under the formal standard ISO/IEC 14496&nbsp;\u2013 ''Coding of audio-visual objects''. Uses of MPEG-4 include compression of AV data for web ([[streaming media]]) and [[Compact disc|CD]] distribution, voice ([[telephone]], [[videophone]]) and [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[television]] applications. The MPEG-4 standard was developed by a group led by Touradj Ebrahimi (later the [[Joint Photographic Experts Group|JPEG]] president) and Fernando Pereira.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ebrahimi |first1=Touradj |last2=Pereira |first2=Fernando |title=The MPEG-4 Book |date=2002 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall Professional]] |isbn=9780130616210 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftRvA08WcM4C}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nMPEG-4 absorbs many of the features of [[MPEG-1]] and [[MPEG-2]] and other related standards, adding new features such as (extended) [[VRML]] support for 3D rendering, object-oriented composite files (including audio, video and VRML objects), support for externally specified [[Digital Rights Management]] and various types of interactivity. [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC (Advanced Audio Coding)]] was standardized as an adjunct to MPEG-2 (as Part 7) before MPEG-4 was issued.\n\nMPEG-4 is still an evolving standard and is divided into a number of parts. Companies promoting MPEG-4 compatibility do not always clearly state which \"part\" level compatibility they are referring to. The key parts to be aware of are [[MPEG-4 Part 2]] (including Advanced Simple Profile, used by codecs such as [[DivX]], [[Xvid]], [[Nero Digital]] and [[3ivx]] and by [[QuickTime]] 6) and [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|MPEG-4 part 10]] (MPEG-4 AVC/[[H.264]] or Advanced Video Coding, used by the [[x264]] encoder, Nero Digital AVC, QuickTime 7, and [[high-definition video]] media like [[Blu-ray Disc]]).\n\nMost of the features included in MPEG-4 are left to individual developers to decide whether or not to implement. This means that there are probably no complete implementations of the entire MPEG-4 set of standards. To deal with this, the standard includes the concept of \"profiles\" and \"levels\", allowing a specific set of capabilities to be defined in a manner appropriate for a subset of applications.\n\nInitially, MPEG-4 was aimed primarily at low [[bit-rate]] video communications; however, its scope as a multimedia coding standard was later expanded. MPEG-4 is efficient across a variety of bit-rates ranging from a few kilobits per second to tens of megabits per second.

With the help of standard procedures, MPEG-4 data can be interpreted and transformed into other signal types compatible with any available network.\n* The MPEG-4 format provides end users with a wide range of interaction with various animated objects.\n* Standardized [[Digital Rights Management]] signaling, otherwise known in the MPEG community as Intellectual Property Management and Protection (IPMP).\n\nThe MPEG-4 format can perform various functions, among which might be the following:\n\n* [[Multiplexing|Multiplexes]] and [[Synchronization|synchronizes]] data, associated with media objects, in such a way that they can be efficiently transported further via network channels.\n* Interaction with the audio-visual scene, which is formed on the side of the receiver.\n\n===Profiles and Levels===\nMPEG-4 provides a large and rich set of tools for encoding.\nSubsets of the MPEG-4 tool sets have been provided for use in specific applications.\nThese subsets, called 'Profiles', limit the size of the tool set a decoder is required to implement.<ref name=\"rfc3640-31\"/> In order to restrict computational complexity, one or more 'Levels' are set for each Profile.<ref name=\"rfc3640-31\"/> A Profile and Level combination allows:<ref name=\"rfc3640-31\">{{citation | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3640#page-31 | title = RFC 3640 | page = 31 | publisher = IETF}}.</ref>\n* A codec builder to implement only the subset of the standard needed, while maintaining interworking with other MPEG-4 devices that implement the same combination.<ref name=\"rfc3640-31\"/>\n* Checking whether MPEG-4 devices comply with the standard, referred to as [[conformance testing]].<ref name=\"rfc3640-31\"/>\n\n==MPEG-4 Parts==\nMPEG-4 consists of several standards\u2014termed \"parts\"\u2014including the following (each part covers a certain aspect of the whole specification):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\"\n|+MPEG-4 parts<ref name=\"mpeg-standards\">{{Cite web|url=http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards.htm |title=MPEG standards&nbsp;\u2013 Full list of standards developed or under development |author=MPEG |publisher=Chiariglione |accessdate=2010-02-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420192552/http://mpeg.chiariglione.org/standards.htm |archivedate=2010-04-20 }}</ref><ref name=\"jtc1-sc29\">{{Cite web|url=http://kikaku.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc29/29w42911.htm#MPEG-4 |title=Programme of Work&nbsp;\u2013 MPEG-4 (Coding of audio-visual objects) |author=ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29 |date=2009-11-09 |accessdate=2009-11-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231054907/http://kikaku.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/sc29/29w42911.htm |archivedate=2013-12-31 }}</ref>\n|-\n! width=\"8%\" | Part\n! width=\"15%\" | Number\n! width=\"6%\" | First public release date (first edition)\n! width=\"6%\" | Latest public release date (last edition)\n! width=\"6%\" | Latest amendment\n! width=\"20%\" | Title\n!

In sports or other competitive activities, it is also done as a sign of good [[sportsmanship]]. Its purpose is to convey trust, respect, balance, and equality.

Typically the fist bump is done with a clenched hand. Only the knuckles of the hand are typically touched to the knuckles of the other person's hand. Like a handshake the fist bump may be used to acknowledge a relationship with another person. However, unlike the formality of a handshake, the fist bump is typically not used to seal a business deal or in formal business settings.\n* The hand hug is a type of handshake popular with politicians, as it can present them as being warm, friendly, trustworthy and honest. This type of handshake involves covering the clenched hands with the remaining free hand, creating a sort of \"cocoon\".<ref>{{Cite book\n  |title = Handshake: Student's Book: A Course in Communication \n  |publisher = OUP Oxford \n  |date=7 November 1996\n  |isbn = 978-90-5617-910-6\n}}</ref>\n* Another version popular with politicians is a \"photo-op handshake\" in which, after the initial grasp both individuals turn to face present photographers and camera men and stay this way for several seconds.\n* Scouts [[scout handshake|shake hands]] with their left hand as a gesture of trust, a practice which originated when the founder of the movement, [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell of Gilwell]], then a British [[cavalry officer]], met an African tribesman.\n*In some areas of [[Africa]], handshakes are continually held to show that the conversation is between the two talking. If they are not shaking hands, others are permitted to enter the conversation.\n* [[Maasai people|Masai]] men in Africa greet one another by a subtle touch of palms of their hands for a very brief moment of time.\n* In [[Liberia]], the [[Liberian snap handshake|snap handshake]] is customary in which the two shakers snap their fingers against each other at the conclusion of the handshake.\n* In [[Ethiopia]], it is considered rude to use the left hand during a handshake. While greeting the elderly or a person in authority, it is also customary to accompany the handshake with a bow and the left hand supporting the right. This is especially important if it is the first time.\n*In [[Thailand]], handshaking is only done if the traditional \"Wai\" is not offered. The person will offer what's called a \u201cwai,\u201d placing their palms together at chest level and bowing. Return the gesture. If you're a man, greet then with \u201cSawadee-krap.\u201d If you're a woman, say \u201cSawadee-kah\u201d (both mean \u201cHello). <ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== Germ spreading ==\nHandshakes are known to spread a number of microbial pathogens. Certain diseases such as [[scabies]] are known to spread the most through direct skin-to-skin contact.

They may serve an [[Evolution|evolutionary]] need to learn about the person whose hand was shaken, replacing a more overt sniffing behavior, as is common among animals and in certain human cultures (such as Tuvalu, Greenland or [[Rural area|rural]] Mongolia, where a quick sniff is part of the traditional greeting ritual).\n<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Idan Frumin|author2=Ofer Perl|author3=Yaara Endevelt-Shapira|author4=Ami Eisen|author5=Neetai Eshel|author6=Iris Heller|author7=Maya Shemesh|author8=Aharon Ravia|author9=Lee Sela|author10=Anat Arzi|author11=Noam Sobel|title=A social chemosignaling function for human handshaking|journal=eLife |volume=4|date=3 March 2015|doi=10.7554/eLife.05154|pmid=25732039|pmc=4345842}}</ref>\n\n==World records==\nIn 1963, Lance Dowson shook 12,500 individuals' hands in {{frac|10|1|2}} hours, in Wrexham, N.

Typically the fist bump is done with a clenched hand. Only the knuckles of the hand are typically touched to the knuckles of the other person's hand. Like a handshake the fist bump may be used to acknowledge a relationship with another person. However, unlike the formality of a handshake, the fist bump is typically not used to seal a business deal or in formal business settings.\n* The hand hug is a type of handshake popular with politicians, as it can present them as being warm, friendly, trustworthy and honest. This type of handshake involves covering the clenched hands with the remaining free hand, creating a sort of \"cocoon\".<ref>{{Cite book\n  |title = Handshake: Student's Book: A Course in Communication \n  |publisher = OUP Oxford \n  |date=7 November 1996\n  |isbn = 978-90-5617-910-6\n}}</ref>\n* Another version popular with politicians is a \"photo-op handshake\" in which, after the initial grasp both individuals turn to face present photographers and camera men and stay this way for several seconds.\n* Scouts [[scout handshake|shake hands]] with their left hand as a gesture of trust, a practice which originated when the founder of the movement, [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Lord Baden-Powell of Gilwell]], then a British [[cavalry officer]], met an African tribesman.\n*In some areas of [[Africa]], handshakes are continually held to show that the conversation is between the two talking. If they are not shaking hands, others are permitted to enter the conversation.\n* [[Maasai people|Masai]] men in Africa greet one another by a subtle touch of palms of their hands for a very brief moment of time.\n* In [[Liberia]], the [[Liberian snap handshake|snap handshake]] is customary in which the two shakers snap their fingers against each other at the conclusion of the handshake.\n* In [[Ethiopia]], it is considered rude to use the left hand during a handshake. While greeting the elderly or a person in authority, it is also customary to accompany the handshake with a bow and the left hand supporting the right. This is especially important if it is the first time.\n*In [[Thailand]], handshaking is only done if the traditional \"Wai\" is not offered. The person will offer what's called a \u201cwai,\u201d placing their palms together at chest level and bowing. Return the gesture. If you're a man, greet then with \u201cSawadee-krap.\u201d If you're a woman, say \u201cSawadee-kah\u201d (both mean \u201cHello). <ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n== Germ spreading ==\nHandshakes are known to spread a number of microbial pathogens. Certain diseases such as [[scabies]] are known to spread the most through direct skin-to-skin contact. A medical study has found that [[fist bumps]] and [[high five]]s spread fewer germs than handshakes.<ref name=\"germ-latimes\" /><ref name=\"germ-abcnews\"/>\n\nIn light of the [[2009 H1N1 pandemic]], the dean of medicine at the [[University of Calgary]], [[Tomas Feasby]], suggested that fist bumps may be a \"nice replacement of the handshake\" in an effort to prevent transmission of the virus.<ref name=\"germ-cbc\"/>\n\nFollowing a 2010 study that showed that only about 40% of doctors and other health care providers complied with hand hygiene rules in hospitals, Mark Sklansky, a doctor at [[UCLA]] hospital, decided to test \"a handshake-free zone\" as a method  for limiting the spread of germs and reducing the transmission of disease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/880856|title=Handshake-Free Zone: Stopping the Spread of Germs in the Hospital|website=Medscape}}</ref> However, UCLA did not allow the ban of the handshakes outright, but they rather suggested other options like fist bumping, smiling, bowing, waving, and non-contact [[Namaste]] gestures.\n\nDuring the [[2019\u20132020 coronavirus pandemic]], a number of countries and organisations adopted policies encouraging people to use alternative modes of greeting instead of a handshake.<ref>BBC News, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/world-europe-51820520/coronavirus-dutch-pm-tells-nation-not-to-shake-hands-then-does Coronavirus: Dutch PM tells nation not to shake hands \u2013 then does], published 10 March 2020, accessed 14 March 2020</ref> Suggested alternatives have included the [[elbow bump]], the [[fist bump]], or non-contact actions for [[social distancing]] purposes, such as a [[namaste]] gesture.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/03/12/814076913/nice-to-meet-you-but-how-to-greet-you-nohandshake-leaves-businesspeople-hanging|title=Nice To Meet You, But How To Greet You? #NoHandshake Leaves Businesspeople Hanging|last=Noguchi|first=Yuki|date=March 12, 2020|work=NPR|accessdate=16 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Chemosignaling==\nIt has been discovered as a part of a research in the [[Weizmann Institute]], that human handshakes serve as a means of transferring social chemical signals between the shakers. \nIt appears that there is a tendency to bring the shaken hands to the vicinity of the nose and smell them. They may serve an [[Evolution|evolutionary]] need to learn about the person whose hand was shaken, replacing a more overt sniffing behavior, as is common among animals and in certain human cultures (such as Tuvalu, Greenland or [[Rural area|rural]] Mongolia, where a quick sniff is part of the traditional greeting ritual).\n<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Idan Frumin|author2=Ofer Perl|author3=Yaara Endevelt-Shapira|author4=Ami Eisen|author5=Neetai Eshel|author6=Iris Heller|author7=Maya Shemesh|author8=Aharon Ravia|author9=Lee Sela|author10=Anat Arzi|author11=Noam Sobel|title=A social chemosignaling function for human handshaking|journal=eLife |volume=4|date=3 March 2015|doi=10.7554/eLife.05154|pmid=25732039|pmc=4345842}}</ref>\n\n==World records==\nIn 1963, Lance Dowson shook 12,500 individuals' hands in {{frac|10|1|2}} hours, in Wrexham, N.

Pre-Columbian art thrived over a wide timescale, from 1800 BC to AD 1500. Certain artistic characteristics were repeated throughout the region, namely a preference for angular, linear patterns, and three-dimensional ceramics.\n\n[[File:De la Conquista a 1930 (2011).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mexican muralism|Mural]] by [[Diego Rivera]] at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] depicting the history of Mexico from the Conquest to early 20th century.]]\n\nNotable handicrafts include clay pottery from the valley of Oaxaca and the village of Tonala. Colorfully embroidered cotton garments, cotton or wool shawls and outer garments, and colorful baskets and rugs are seen everywhere. Mexico is also known for its [[Mesoamerican architecture|pre-Columbian architecture]], especially for public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures.\n\nFollowing the conquest, the first artistic efforts were directed at evangelization and the related task of building churches. The Spanish initially co-opted many indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches, monuments and other religious art, such as [[Altar (Catholicism)|altars]]. The prevailing style during this era was [[Baroque]].\nIn the period from independence to the early 20th century, Mexican fine arts continued to be largely influenced by European traditions.\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]], a new generation of Mexican artists led a vibrant national movement that incorporated political, historic and folk themes in their work. The painters [[Diego Rivera]], [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Siqueiros]] were the main propagators of [[Mexican muralism]]. Their grand murals often displayed on public buildings, promoted social ideals. [[Rufino Tamayo]] and [[Frida Kahlo]] produced more personal works with abstract elements. Mexican art [[photography]] was largely fostered by the work of [[Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1064-mexican-muralists-the-big-three-orozco-rivera-siqueiros|title=Mexican muralists: the big three - Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros. : Mexico Culture & Arts|website=www.mexconnect.com}}</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n{{Main|Mexican literature}}\n[[Image:Sor Juana by Miguel Cabrera.png|175px|thumb|A late 18th-century painting of [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]], poet and writer.]]\n\nMexican literature has its antecedents in the literature of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica.

Mesoamerican architecture in Mexico is best known for its public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures, several of which are the largest monuments in the world. Mesoamerican architecture is divided into three eras, Pre-Classic, Classic, and Post-Classic. Architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] is reputed to have declared the [[Puuc]]-style architecture of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] as the best in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"Freidel\">{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/0703/abstracts/maya.html |title=Betraying the Maya |publisher=Archeology Magazine |accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New Spanish Baroque]] dominated in early colonial Mexico. During the late 17th century to 1750, one of Mexico's most popular architectural styles was Mexican [[Churrigueresque]], which combined [[Amerindian]] and [[Moorish]] decorative influences.\n\nThe [[Academy of San Carlos]], founded in 1788, was the first major art academy in the Americas. The academy promoted [[Neoclassicism]], focusing on Greek and Roman art and architecture. Notable Neoclassical works include the [[Hospicio Caba\u00f1as]], a world heritage site, and the [[Palacio de Miner\u00eda]], both by Spanish Mexican architect [[Manuel Tols\u00e1]].\n\nFrom 1864 to 1867, during the [[Second Mexican Empire]], [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] was installed as emperor of Mexico. His architectural legacy lies in the redesigning of the [[Castillo de Chapultepec]] and creating the [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. This intervention, financed largely by France, was brief, but it began a period of French influence in architecture and culture. The style was emphasized during the presidency of [[Porfirio Diaz]] who was a pronounced [[francophile]]. Notable works from the [[Porfiriato]] include the [[Palacio de Correos de Mexico|Palacio de Correos]] and a large [[Rail transport in Mexico|network of railways]].\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1917, idealization of the indigenous and the traditional symbolized attempts to reach into the past and retrieve what had been lost in the race toward modernization.\n\nFunctionalism, expressionism, and other schools left their imprint on a large number of works in which Mexican stylistic elements have been combined with European and American techniques, most notably the work of [[Pritzker Prize]] winner [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n]]. His personal home, the [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n House and Studio]], is a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n[[Enrique Norten]], the founder of TEN Arquitectos, has been awarded several honors for his work in [[modern architecture]]. His work expresses a modernity that reinforces the government's desire to present a new image of Mexico as an industrialized country with a global presence.\n\nOther notable and emerging contemporary architects include [[Mario Schjetnan]], [[Michel Rojkind]], [[Isaac Broid Zajman]],  [[Bernardo G\u00f3mez-Pimienta]], and [[Alberto Kalach]].\n\n==Cinema==\n[[File:Cineteca Nacional 05.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The National film library.]]\n{{Main|Cinema of Mexico}}\n{{See also|Television in Mexico}}\n\nThe history of Mexican cinema dates to the beginning of the 20th century when several enthusiasts of the new medium documented historical events \u2013 most particularly the Mexican Revolution. The [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema]] is the name given to the period between 1935 and 1959, where the quality and economic success of the cinema of Mexico reached its peak. An era when renowned actors such as [[Cantinflas]] and [[Dolores del R\u00edo]] appeared on the silver screen.\n\nPresent-day film makers include [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] (''[[Amores perros]]'', ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]''), [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] (''[[Children of Men]]'', ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''), [[Guillermo del Toro]] (''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]''), [[Carlos Reygadas]] (''[[Silent Light|Stellet Licht]]''), screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] and owners [[Guillermo Navarro]] and [[Emmanuel Lubezki]].\n\n==National holidays==\n{{Main|Public holidays in Mexico}}\n\n{{see also|Christmas in Mexico}}\n\n[[Image:GritoIxmiquilpan.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Municipal president giving the \"[[Grito de Dolores|grito]]\" of \"Viva M\u00e9xico\" at the commencement of Independence Day festivities in 2008]]\n\nMexicans celebrate their [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence from Spain]] on September 16, and other holidays with festivals known as \"Fiestas\". Many Mexican cities, towns, and villages hold a yearly festival to commemorate their local patron saints. During these festivities, the people pray and burn candles to honor their saints in churches decorated with flowers and colorful utensils. They also hold large parades, fireworks, dance competitions, beauty pageant contest, party and buy refreshments in the marketplaces and public squares. In the smaller towns and villages, soccer, and boxing are also celebrated during the festivities.\n\n{{multiple image\n   | direction = vertical\n   | width     = 350px\n   | header    =\n   | align     = left\n   | image1    = Dulces de amaranto.jpg\n   | width1   = \n   | caption1  = Skulls made of [[amaranto]], given during the [[Day of the Dead]] festival.\n   | image2    = \u00a1Feliz Dia de la Revolucion Mexico!.jpg\n   | width2   = \n   | caption2  =  [[Revolution Day]] marking the start of what became the Mexican Revolution.\n  }}\n\nOther festivities include D\u00eda de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guadalupe (\"Our Lady of Guadalupe Day\"), [[Las Posadas]] (\"The Shelters\", celebrated on December 16 to December 24), [[Nochebuena|Noche Buena]] (\"Holy Night\", celebrated on December 24), [[Christmas|Navidad]] (\"Christmas\", celebrated on December 25) and [[New Year's Day|A\u00f1o Nuevo]] (\"New Year's Day\", celebrated on December 31 to January 1).\n\n\"Guadalupe Day\" is regarded by many Mexicans as the most important religious holiday of their country. It honors the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint of Mexico, which is celebrated on December 12.

The gifts presented turn the graveyard from a dull and sorrowful place to an intimate and hospitable environment to celebrate the dead.<ref name=\"mexican halloween\"/>\n\nIn modern Mexico and particularly in the larger cities and in the North, local traditions are now being observed and intertwined with the greater North American Santa Claus tradition, as well as with other holidays such as [[Halloween]], due to Americanization via film and television, creating an economy of gifting tradition that spans from Christmas Day until January 6.\n\nA [[pi\u00f1ata]] is made from papier-mache. It is created to look like popular people, animals, or fictional characters. Once made it is painted with bright colors and filled with candy or small toys. It is then hung from the ceiling.

Popular beverages include water flavored with a variety of fruit juices, and cinnamon-flavored [[hot chocolate]] prepared with [[milk]] or water and blended until it becomes [[frothed]] using a traditional wooden tool called a ''[[Molinillo (whisk)|molinillo]]''. Alcoholic beverages native to Mexico include [[Mezcal|mescal]], [[pulque]], and [[tequila]]. [[Mexican beer]] is also popular in Mexico and are exported.

[[Chipotle]], a smoked-dried jalape\u00f1o pepper, is also common in Mexican cuisine. Many Mexican dishes also contain [[onion]]s and [[garlic]], which are also some of Mexico's staple foods.\n\nNext to [[Maize|corn]], [[rice]] is the most common grain in Mexican cuisine. According to food writer Karen Hursh Graber, the initial introduction of rice to Spain from North Africa in the 14th century led to the Spanish introduction of rice to Mexico at the port of [[Veracruz]] in the 1520s. This, Graber says, created one of the earliest instances of the world's greatest [[Fusion cuisine]]'s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nIn southeastern Mexico, especially in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]], spicy vegetable and meat dishes are common. The cuisine of Southeastern Mexico has quite a bit of Caribbean influence, given its geographical location. Seafood is commonly prepared in the states that border the Pacific Ocean or the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the latter having a famous reputation for its fish dishes, ''\u00e0 la veracruzana''.\n\nIn contemporary times, various world cuisines have become popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, [[sushi]] in Mexico is often made by using a variety of sauces based on [[mango]] and [[tamarind]], and very often served with [[serrano pepper|serrano]]-chili blended soy sauce, or complemented with vinegar, habanero peppers, and chipotle peppers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[Chocolate]] originated in Mexico and was prized by the [[Aztecs]].

MFF Pra\u017esk\u00fd jarmark 3540.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Northern Dance in Nuevo Leon]]\n\nThe foundation of Mexican music comes from its indigenous sounds and heritage. The original inhabitants of the land used drums (such as the [[teponaztli]]), [[flute]]s, [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]], [[conch]]es as trumpets and their [[voice]]s to make music and dances. This ancient music is still played in some parts of Mexico. However, much of the traditional contemporary music of Mexico was written during and after the Spanish colonial period, using many [[old world]] influenced instruments. Many traditional instruments, such as the [[Mexican vihuela]] used in [[Mariachi music]], were adapted from their old world predecessors and are now considered very Mexican.\n\n[[Image:JarabeTapatio.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jarabe Tapat\u00edo]] in the traditional [[China Poblana]] dress.]]\n\nMexican society enjoys a vast array of music genres, showing the diversity of Mexican culture. Traditional music includes [[Mariachi]], [[banda music|Banda]], [[Norte\u00f1o (music)|Norte\u00f1o]], [[Ranchera]] and [[Corrido (Mexico)|Corrido]]s. Mexicans also listen to contemporary music such as [[Mexican pop music|pop]] and [[Mexican rock music|Mexican rock]]. Mexico has the largest media industry in Latin America, producing Mexican artists who are famous in the [[Americas]] and parts of Europe.\n\nFolk songs called [[corridos]] have been popular in Mexico since the early nineteen hundreds. It may tell the story of the Mexican Revolution, pride, [[Mestizaje]], romance, poverty, politics or crime. Notable [[Afro-Mexican]] contributions to the country's music are the [[Son Jarocho]] and the [[marimba]].\n\nMariachis perform along streets, festivals and restaurants. A common Mariachi group can include singers, [[violin]]s, a [[Guitarr\u00f3n mexicano|guitarr\u00f3n]], a [[guitarra de golpe]], vihuela, [[guitar]]s, and [[trumpet]]s. The most prominent Mariachi group is [[Vargas de Tecalitl\u00e1n]], which was originally formed in 1897.\n\n[[File:PolancoVoladoresdePapantla.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Danza de los Voladores]], a ritual dance performed by the [[Totonacs]].]]\n\nOther styles of traditional regional music in M\u00e9xico: [[Huapango]] or [[Son Huasteco]] (Huasteca, northeastern regions, violin and two guitars known as quinta huapanguera and [[jarana huasteca|jarana]]), Tambora (Sinaloa, mainly [[brass instruments]]) [[Duranguense]], Jarana (most of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula) and [[Norte\u00f1a]] (North style, [[redoba]] and [[accordion]]).\n\nFolk dances are a feature of Mexican culture. Significant in dance tradition is the \"[[Jarabe Tapat\u00edo]]\", known as \"Mexican hat dance\". Traditional dancers perform a sequence of hopping steps, heel and toe-tapping movements.\n\nAmong the most known \"classical\" composers: [[Manuel M. Ponce]] (\"Estrellita\"), Revueltas, Jord\u00e1 (Elodia), [[Ricardo Castro]], [[Juventino Rosas]] (\"Sobre las olas\"), Carrillo (Sonido 13), Ibarra, Pablo Moncayo (Huapango) and [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]].\n\nPopular composers includes: [[Agust\u00edn Lara]], [[Consuelo Vel\u00e1zquez]] (\"[[B\u00e9same mucho]]\"), [[Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Jim\u00e9nez]], [[Armando Manzanero]], [[\u00c1lvaro Carrillo]], [[Joaqu\u00edn Pardav\u00e9]] and [[Alfonso Ortiz Tirado]].\n\nTraditional Mexican music has influenced the evolution of the [[Mexican pop]] and [[Mexican rock]] genre. Some well-known Mexican pop singers are [[Luis Miguel]] and [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]]. Latin rock musicians such as [[Carlos Santana]], [[Caf\u00e9 Tacuba]] and [[Caifanes]] have incorporated Mexican folk tunes into their music. Traditional Mexican music is still alive in the voices of artists such as [[Lila Downs]].\n\n==Sport==\n{{Main|Sport in Mexico}}\n[[File:Azteca 008.png|thumb|Club Am\u00e9rica vs Cruz Azul at the [[Estadio Azteca]].]]\n\nThe traditional national sport of Mexico is [[Charreria]], which consists of a series of equestrian events.

Mexico has the largest venue for bullfighting in the world - the [[Plaza M\u00e9xico]] in Mexico City which seats 48,000 people.\n\n[[Association Football|Football]] is the most popular team sport in Mexico.

Pre-Columbian art thrived over a wide timescale, from 1800 BC to AD 1500. Certain artistic characteristics were repeated throughout the region, namely a preference for angular, linear patterns, and three-dimensional ceramics.\n\n[[File:De la Conquista a 1930 (2011).jpg|thumb|left|[[Mexican muralism|Mural]] by [[Diego Rivera]] at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] depicting the history of Mexico from the Conquest to early 20th century.]]\n\nNotable handicrafts include clay pottery from the valley of Oaxaca and the village of Tonala. Colorfully embroidered cotton garments, cotton or wool shawls and outer garments, and colorful baskets and rugs are seen everywhere. Mexico is also known for its [[Mesoamerican architecture|pre-Columbian architecture]], especially for public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures.\n\nFollowing the conquest, the first artistic efforts were directed at evangelization and the related task of building churches. The Spanish initially co-opted many indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches, monuments and other religious art, such as [[Altar (Catholicism)|altars]]. The prevailing style during this era was [[Baroque]].\nIn the period from independence to the early 20th century, Mexican fine arts continued to be largely influenced by European traditions.\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]], a new generation of Mexican artists led a vibrant national movement that incorporated political, historic and folk themes in their work. The painters [[Diego Rivera]], [[Jos\u00e9 Clemente Orozco]], and [[David Siqueiros]] were the main propagators of [[Mexican muralism]]. Their grand murals often displayed on public buildings, promoted social ideals. [[Rufino Tamayo]] and [[Frida Kahlo]] produced more personal works with abstract elements. Mexican art [[photography]] was largely fostered by the work of [[Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1064-mexican-muralists-the-big-three-orozco-rivera-siqueiros|title=Mexican muralists: the big three - Orozco, Rivera, Siqueiros. : Mexico Culture & Arts|website=www.mexconnect.com}}</ref>\n\n==Literature==\n{{Main|Mexican literature}}\n[[Image:Sor Juana by Miguel Cabrera.png|175px|thumb|A late 18th-century painting of [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]], poet and writer.]]\n\nMexican literature has its antecedents in the literature of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica.

Mesoamerican architecture in Mexico is best known for its public, ceremonial and urban monumental buildings and structures, several of which are the largest monuments in the world. Mesoamerican architecture is divided into three eras, Pre-Classic, Classic, and Post-Classic. Architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] is reputed to have declared the [[Puuc]]-style architecture of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] as the best in the [[Western Hemisphere]].<ref name=\"Freidel\">{{cite web|url=http://archive.archaeology.org/0703/abstracts/maya.html |title=Betraying the Maya |publisher=Archeology Magazine |accessdate=November 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe [[New Spanish Baroque]] dominated in early colonial Mexico. During the late 17th century to 1750, one of Mexico's most popular architectural styles was Mexican [[Churrigueresque]], which combined [[Amerindian]] and [[Moorish]] decorative influences.\n\nThe [[Academy of San Carlos]], founded in 1788, was the first major art academy in the Americas. The academy promoted [[Neoclassicism]], focusing on Greek and Roman art and architecture. Notable Neoclassical works include the [[Hospicio Caba\u00f1as]], a world heritage site, and the [[Palacio de Miner\u00eda]], both by Spanish Mexican architect [[Manuel Tols\u00e1]].\n\nFrom 1864 to 1867, during the [[Second Mexican Empire]], [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] was installed as emperor of Mexico. His architectural legacy lies in the redesigning of the [[Castillo de Chapultepec]] and creating the [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. This intervention, financed largely by France, was brief, but it began a period of French influence in architecture and culture. The style was emphasized during the presidency of [[Porfirio Diaz]] who was a pronounced [[francophile]]. Notable works from the [[Porfiriato]] include the [[Palacio de Correos de Mexico|Palacio de Correos]] and a large [[Rail transport in Mexico|network of railways]].\n\nAfter the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1917, idealization of the indigenous and the traditional symbolized attempts to reach into the past and retrieve what had been lost in the race toward modernization.\n\nFunctionalism, expressionism, and other schools left their imprint on a large number of works in which Mexican stylistic elements have been combined with European and American techniques, most notably the work of [[Pritzker Prize]] winner [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n]]. His personal home, the [[Luis Barrag\u00e1n House and Studio]], is a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n[[Enrique Norten]], the founder of TEN Arquitectos, has been awarded several honors for his work in [[modern architecture]]. His work expresses a modernity that reinforces the government's desire to present a new image of Mexico as an industrialized country with a global presence.\n\nOther notable and emerging contemporary architects include [[Mario Schjetnan]], [[Michel Rojkind]], [[Isaac Broid Zajman]],  [[Bernardo G\u00f3mez-Pimienta]], and [[Alberto Kalach]].\n\n==Cinema==\n[[File:Cineteca Nacional 05.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The National film library.]]\n{{Main|Cinema of Mexico}}\n{{See also|Television in Mexico}}\n\nThe history of Mexican cinema dates to the beginning of the 20th century when several enthusiasts of the new medium documented historical events \u2013 most particularly the Mexican Revolution.

Many Mexican dishes also contain [[onion]]s and [[garlic]], which are also some of Mexico's staple foods.\n\nNext to [[Maize|corn]], [[rice]] is the most common grain in Mexican cuisine. According to food writer Karen Hursh Graber, the initial introduction of rice to Spain from North Africa in the 14th century led to the Spanish introduction of rice to Mexico at the port of [[Veracruz]] in the 1520s. This, Graber says, created one of the earliest instances of the world's greatest [[Fusion cuisine]]'s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nIn southeastern Mexico, especially in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]], spicy vegetable and meat dishes are common. The cuisine of Southeastern Mexico has quite a bit of Caribbean influence, given its geographical location. Seafood is commonly prepared in the states that border the Pacific Ocean or the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the latter having a famous reputation for its fish dishes, ''\u00e0 la veracruzana''.\n\nIn contemporary times, various world cuisines have become popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, [[sushi]] in Mexico is often made by using a variety of sauces based on [[mango]] and [[tamarind]], and very often served with [[serrano pepper|serrano]]-chili blended soy sauce, or complemented with vinegar, habanero peppers, and chipotle peppers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n[[Chocolate]] originated in Mexico and was prized by the [[Aztecs]].

The original inhabitants of the land used drums (such as the [[teponaztli]]), [[flute]]s, [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|rattles]], [[conch]]es as trumpets and their [[voice]]s to make music and dances. This ancient music is still played in some parts of Mexico. However, much of the traditional contemporary music of Mexico was written during and after the Spanish colonial period, using many [[old world]] influenced instruments. Many traditional instruments, such as the [[Mexican vihuela]] used in [[Mariachi music]], were adapted from their old world predecessors and are now considered very Mexican.\n\n[[Image:JarabeTapatio.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Jarabe Tapat\u00edo]] in the traditional [[China Poblana]] dress.]]\n\nMexican society enjoys a vast array of music genres, showing the diversity of Mexican culture. Traditional music includes [[Mariachi]], [[banda music|Banda]], [[Norte\u00f1o (music)|Norte\u00f1o]], [[Ranchera]] and [[Corrido (Mexico)|Corrido]]s. Mexicans also listen to contemporary music such as [[Mexican pop music|pop]] and [[Mexican rock music|Mexican rock]]. Mexico has the largest media industry in Latin America, producing Mexican artists who are famous in the [[Americas]] and parts of Europe.\n\nFolk songs called [[corridos]] have been popular in Mexico since the early nineteen hundreds. It may tell the story of the Mexican Revolution, pride, [[Mestizaje]], romance, poverty, politics or crime. Notable [[Afro-Mexican]] contributions to the country's music are the [[Son Jarocho]] and the [[marimba]].\n\nMariachis perform along streets, festivals and restaurants. A common Mariachi group can include singers, [[violin]]s, a [[Guitarr\u00f3n mexicano|guitarr\u00f3n]], a [[guitarra de golpe]], vihuela, [[guitar]]s, and [[trumpet]]s. The most prominent Mariachi group is [[Vargas de Tecalitl\u00e1n]], which was originally formed in 1897.\n\n[[File:PolancoVoladoresdePapantla.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Danza de los Voladores]], a ritual dance performed by the [[Totonacs]].]]\n\nOther styles of traditional regional music in M\u00e9xico: [[Huapango]] or [[Son Huasteco]] (Huasteca, northeastern regions, violin and two guitars known as quinta huapanguera and [[jarana huasteca|jarana]]), Tambora (Sinaloa, mainly [[brass instruments]]) [[Duranguense]], Jarana (most of the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula) and [[Norte\u00f1a]] (North style, [[redoba]] and [[accordion]]).\n\nFolk dances are a feature of Mexican culture. Significant in dance tradition is the \"[[Jarabe Tapat\u00edo]]\", known as \"Mexican hat dance\". Traditional dancers perform a sequence of hopping steps, heel and toe-tapping movements.\n\nAmong the most known \"classical\" composers: [[Manuel M.

Some well-known Mexican pop singers are [[Luis Miguel]] and [[Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez]]. Latin rock musicians such as [[Carlos Santana]], [[Caf\u00e9 Tacuba]] and [[Caifanes]] have incorporated Mexican folk tunes into their music. Traditional Mexican music is still alive in the voices of artists such as [[Lila Downs]].\n\n==Sport==\n{{Main|Sport in Mexico}}\n[[File:Azteca 008.png|thumb|Club Am\u00e9rica vs Cruz Azul at the [[Estadio Azteca]].]]\n\nThe traditional national sport of Mexico is [[Charreria]], which consists of a series of equestrian events.

Seacole then worked alongside her mother, occasionally being called to assist at the [[British Army]] hospital at [[Up-Park Camp]]. She also travelled the Caribbean, visiting the British colony of [[New Providence]] in The Bahamas, the Spanish colony of [[Cuba]], and the new republic of [[Haiti]]. Seacole records these travels, but omits mention of significant current events, such as the [[Baptist War|Christmas Rebellion]] in Jamaica of 1831, the partial abolition of slavery in 1834,<ref>Robinson, p. 34.</ref> and the full abolition of slavery in 1838.<ref>Salih, p. xx.</ref>\n\nShe married Edwin Horatio Hamilton Seacole in Kingston on 10 November 1836.<ref>The wedding of Mary and Edwin Seacole is featured in [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1427915/ ''Mother Seacole'']</ref> Her marriage, from betrothal to widowhood, is described in just nine lines at the conclusion of the first chapter of her autobiography.<ref name=\"SeacoleI\" /> Robinson reports the legend in the Seacole family that Edwin was an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate son]] of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson]] and his mistress, [[Emma,_Lady_Hamilton|Emma Hamilton]], who was adopted by Thomas, a local \"surgeon, apothecary and man midwife\"<ref>Robinson, footnote 1c chapter 6.</ref> (Seacole's will indicates that Horatio Seacole was Nelson's [[Godparent|godson:]]  she left a diamond ring to her friend, [[Henry Montagu, 6th Baron Rokeby|Lord Rokeby]], \"given to my late husband by his godfather Viscount Nelson\", but there was no mention of this godson in Nelson's own will or its [[Codicil (will)|codicils]].)<ref>Robinson, footnote 1 to Chapter 6, p. 209.</ref>  Edwin was a merchant and seems to have had a poor constitution.

There, approximately {{convert|45|mi|km}} up the [[Chagres River]] from the coast, he followed the family trade by establishing the Independent Hotel to accommodate the many travellers between the eastern and western coasts of the United States (the number of travellers had increased enormously, as part of the 1849 [[California Gold Rush]]<ref>Robinson, p. 42.</ref>).

Seacole later expressed exasperation at their feeble resistance, claiming they \"bowed down before the plague in slavish despair\".<ref name=\"SeacoleIV\" /> She performed an [[autopsy]] on an orphan child for whom she had cared, which gave her \"decidedly useful\" new knowledge. At the end of this epidemic she herself contracted cholera, forcing her to rest for several weeks. In her autobiography, ''The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands'', she describes how the residents of Cruces responded: \"When it became known that their \"yellow doctress\" had the cholera, I must do the people of Cruces the justice to say that they gave me plenty of sympathy, and would have shown their regard for me more actively, had there been any occasion.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands|last=Seacole|first=Mary|publisher=James Blackwood|year=1857|isbn=|location=London|pages=Chapter V}}</ref>\n\nCholera was to return again: [[Ulysses S.

Seeing a business opportunity, Seacole opened the British Hotel, which was a restaurant rather than an hotel. She described it as a \"tumble down hut,\" with two rooms, the smaller one to be her bedroom, the larger one to serve up to 50 diners. She soon added the services of a barber.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs the wet season ended in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in packing up to move to Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that \"God bless the best yaller woman he ever made\" and asked the listeners to join with him in rejoicing that \"she's so many shades removed from being entirely black\".

In late 1852, she travelled home to Jamaica. Already delayed, the journey was further made difficult when she encountered racial discrimination while trying to book passage on an American ship. She was forced to wait for a later British boat.<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" /> In 1853, soon after arriving home, Seacole was asked by the Jamaican medical authorities to minister to victims of a severe outbreak of [[yellow fever]].<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" />  She found that she could do little, because the epidemic was so severe. Her memoirs state that her own boarding house was full of sufferers and she saw many of them die. Although she wrote, \"I was sent for by the medical authorities to provide nurses for the sick at [[Up-Park Camp]],\" she did not claim to bring nurses with her when she went. She left her sister with some nurses at her house, went to the camp (about a mile, or 1.6&nbsp;km, from [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]), \"and did my best, but it was little we could do to mitigate the severity of the epidemic.\"<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" />\n\nSeacole returned to Panama in early 1854 to finalise her business affairs, and three months later moved to the New Granada Mining Gold Company establishment at Fort Bowen Mine some {{convert|70|mi|km}} away near Escribanos.<ref name=\"SeacoleVII\">Seacole, Chapter VII.</ref> The superintendent, Thomas Day, was related to her late husband. Seacole had read newspaper reports of the outbreak of war against Russia before she left Jamaica, and news of the escalating [[Crimean War]] reached her in Panama. She determined to travel to England to volunteer as a nurse,<ref name=\"SeacoleVII\" /> to experience the \"pomp, pride and circumstance of glorious war\" as she described it in Chapter I of her autobiography. A part of her reasoning for going to the Crimean was that she knew some of the soldiers that were deployed there. In her autobiography she explains how she heard of soldiers that she had cared for in the 97th and 48th regiments were being shipped back to England in preparation for the fighting on the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n== Crimean War, 1853\u201356 ==\n[[File:Seacole simpson sketch.png|thumb|Sketch of Mary Seacole by Crimean [[war artist]] [[William Simpson (artist)|William Simpson]] (1823\u20131899), c.&nbsp;1855]]\nThe [[Crimean War]] lasted from October 1853 until 1 April 1856 and was fought between the [[Russian Empire]] and an alliance of the United Kingdom, [[Second French Empire|France]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The majority of the conflict took place on the [[Crimea|Crimean peninsula]] in the [[Black Sea]] and [[Turkey]].\n\nMany thousands of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from Cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better when they arrived at the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in ''[[The Times]]'' on 14 October triggered [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sidney Herbert]], [[Secretary of State for War]], to approach [[Florence Nightingale]] to form a detachment of nurses to be sent to the hospital to save lives. Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.<ref>Robinson, pp. 85\u201387.</ref>\n\nSeacole travelled from Navy Bay in Panama to England, initially to deal with her investments in gold-mining businesses. She then attempted to join the second contingent of nurses to the Crimea. She applied to the War Office and other government offices, but arrangements for departure were already underway. In her memoir, she wrote that she brought \"ample testimony\" of her experience in nursing, but the only example officially cited was that of a former medical officer of the West Granada Gold-Mining Company. However, Seacole wrote that this was just one of the testimonials she had in her possession.<ref name=\"SeacoleVIII\">Seacole, Chapter VIII.</ref>  Seacole wrote in her autobiography, \"Now, I am not for a single instant going to blame the authorities who would not listen to the offer of a motherly yellow woman to go to the Crimea and nurse her \"sons\" there, suffering from cholera, diarrh\u0153a, and a host of lesser ills. In my country, where people know our use, it would have been different; but here it was natural enough \u2013 although I had references, and other voices spoke for me \u2013 that they should laugh, good-naturedly enough, at my offer.\"<ref>Mary Seacole, ''Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands'', Chapter VIII (London: James Blackwood, 1857), pp. 73-81.</ref>\n\nSeacole also applied to the Crimean Fund, a fund raised by public subscription to support the wounded in Crimea, for sponsorship to travel there, but she again met with refusal.<ref>Robinson, p. 90.</ref> Seacole questioned whether racism was a factor in her being turned down. She wrote in her autobiography, \"Was it possible that American prejudices against colour had some root here?

[[Business card]]s were printed and sent ahead to announce her intention to open an establishment, to be called the \"British Hotel\", near Balaclava, which would be \"a mess-table and comfortable quarters for sick and convalescent officers\".<ref name=\"SeacoleVIII\" /> Shortly afterwards, her Caribbean acquaintance, Thomas Day, arrived unexpectedly in London, and the two formed a partnership. They assembled a stock of supplies, and Seacole embarked on the Dutch screw-steamer ''Hollander'' on 27 January 1855 on its maiden voyage, to [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"SeacoleVIII\" /><ref>Robinson, p. 91.</ref> The ship called at [[Malta]], where Seacole encountered a doctor who had recently left [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Scutari]]. He wrote her a [[letter of introduction]] to Nightingale.<ref name=\"SeacoleIX\">Seacole, Chapter IX.</ref>\n\nSeacole visited Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital in Scutari, where she asked for a bed for the night. Seacole wrote, \"Mrs. B. questions me very kindly, but with the same look of curiosity and surprise. What object has Mrs. Seacole in coming out? This is the purport of her questions. And I say, frankly, to be of use somewhere; for other considerations I had not, until necessity forced them upon me. Willingly, had they accepted me, I would have worked for the wounded, in return for bread and water. I fancy Mrs. B\u2014 thought that I sought for employment at Scutari, for she said, very kindly \u2013 \"Miss Nightingale has the entire management of our hospital staff, but I do not think that any vacancy \u2013 \"<ref>Seacole, ''Wonderful Adventures'', Chapter XI, pp. 82-91.</ref>\n\nSeacole interrupted Bracebridge to inform her that she intended to travel to Balaclava the next day to join her business partner. In her memoirs, she reported that her meeting with Nightingale was friendly, with Nightingale asking \"What do you want, Mrs. Seacole? Anything we can do for you? If it lies in my power, I shall be very happy.\"<ref name=\"SeacoleIX\">Seacole, Chapter IX.</ref> Seacole told her of her \"dread of the night journey by [[ca\u00efque|caique]]\" and the improbability of being able to find the ''Hollander'' in the dark. A bed was then found for her and breakfast sent her in the morning, with a \"kind message\" from Bracebridge. A footnote in the memoir states that Seacole subsequently \"saw much of Miss Nightingale at Balaclava,\" but no further meetings are recorded in the text.\n\nAfter transferring most of her stores to the transport ship ''Albatross'', with the remainder following on the ''Nonpareil'', she set out on the four-day voyage to the British bridgehead into Crimea at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]].<ref name=\"SeacoleX\">Seacole, Chapter X.</ref>\n\nLacking proper building materials, Seacole gathered abandoned metal and wood in her spare moments, with a view to using the debris to build her hotel. She found a site for the hotel at a place she christened Spring Hill, near [[Kadikoi]], some {{convert|3+1/2|mi|km}} along the main British supply road from Balaclava to the British camp near [[Sevastopol]], and within a mile of the British headquarters.<ref name=\"SeacoleXI\">Seacole, Chapter XI.</ref>\n\nThe hotel was built from the salvaged driftwood, packing cases, iron sheets, and salvaged architectural items such as glass doors and window-frames, from the village of Kamara, using hired local labour.<ref name=\"SeacoleXI\" /> The new British Hotel opened in March 1855. An early visitor was [[Alexis Soyer]], a noted French chef who had travelled to Crimea to help improve the diet of British soldiers. He records meeting Seacole in his 1857 work ''A Culinary Campaign'' and describes Seacole as \"an old dame of a jovial appearance, but a few shades darker than the white lily\".<ref>Quoted by Ramdin, p. 85.</ref> Seacole requested Soyer's advice on how to manage her business, and was advised to concentrate on food and beverage service, and not to have beds for visitors because the few either slept on board ships in the harbour or in tents in the camp.<ref name=\"Soyer\">Alexis Soyer, ''Soyer's Culinary Campaign'',(London: G. Routledge, 1857), p. 233.</ref>\n\nThe hotel was completed in July at a total cost of \u00a3800. It included a building made of iron, containing a main room with counters and shelves and storage above, an attached kitchen, two wooden sleeping huts, outhouses, and an enclosed stable-yard.<ref name=\"SeacoleXII\">Seacole, Chapter XII.</ref><ref>Robinson, p. 111.</ref> The building was stocked with provisions shipped from London and Constantinople, as well as local purchases from the British camp near Kadikoi and the French camp at nearby [[Gagarin Raion|Kamiesch]]. Seacole sold anything \u2013 \"from a needle to an anchor\"\u2014to army officers and visiting sightseers.<ref name=\"SeacoleXII\" /> Meals were served at the Hotel, cooked by two black cooks, and the kitchen also provided outside catering.\n\nDespite constant thefts, particularly of livestock, Seacole's establishment prospered. Chapter XIV of ''Wonderful Adventures'' describes the meals and supplies provided to officers. They were closed at 8 pm daily and on Sundays. Seacole did some of the cooking herself: \"Whenever I had a few leisure moments, I used to wash my hands, roll up my sleeves, and roll out pastry.\" When called to \"dispense medications,\" she did so.<ref name=\"SeacoleXIV\">Seacole, Chapter XIV.</ref> Soyer was a frequent visitor, and praised Seacole's offerings,<ref name=\"SeacoleXV\">Seacole, Chapter XV.</ref> noting that she offered him champagne on his first visit.<ref name=\"Soyer\" /> \n\nTo Soyer, near the time of departure, Florence Nightingale acknowledged favourable views of Seacole, consistent with their one known meeting in Scutari. Soyer's remarks\u2014he knew both women\u2014show pleasantness on both sides. Seacole told him of her encounter with Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital: \"You must know, M Soyer, that Miss Nightingale is very fond of me. When I passed through Scutari, she very kindly gave me board and lodging.\"<ref>Soyer, p. 434.</ref> When he related Seacole's inquiries to Nightingale, she replied \"with a smile: 'I should like to see her before she leaves, as I hear she has done a deal of good for the poor soldiers.'\"<ref>Soyer, p. 43.</ref> Nightingale, however, did not want her nurses associating with Seacole, as she wrote to her brother-in-law.<ref>Letter, 5 August 1870, Wellcome Ms 9004/60.</ref>\n\n[[File:SeacoleWar.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Map illustrating Mary Seacole's involvement in the Crimean War]]\nSeacole often went out to the troops as a [[sutler]],<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/seacole_mary.shtml|title=Mary Seacole (1805\u20131881)|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=c. 2005|accessdate=30 March 2008}}</ref> selling her provisions near the British camp at Kadikoi, and attending to casualties brought out from the trenches around Sevastopol or from the [[Battle of the Chernaya|Tchernaya valley]].<ref name=nuos/> She was widely known to the British Army as \"Mother Seacole\".<ref name=mixedfolks/>\n\nApart from serving officers at the British Hotel, Seacole also provided catering for spectators at the battles, and spent time on Cathcart's Hill, some {{convert|3+1/2|mi|km}} north of the British Hotel, as an observer. On one occasion, attending wounded troops under fire, she dislocated her right thumb, an injury which never healed entirely.<ref name=\"SeacoleXVI\">Seacole, Chapter XVI.</ref> In a dispatch written on 14 September 1855, [[William Howard Russell]], special correspondent of ''The Times'', wrote that she was a \"warm and successful physician, who doctors and cures all manner of men with extraordinary success. She is always in attendance near the battlefield to aid the wounded and has earned many a poor fellow's blessing.\" Russell also wrote that she \"redeemed the name of sutler\", and another that she was \"both a Miss Nightingale and a [chef]\". Seacole made a point of wearing brightly coloured, and highly conspicuous, clothing\u2014often bright blue, or yellow, with ribbons in contrasting colours.<ref>''The Times'', 26 September 1855, p. 6.</ref><ref>Robinson, p. 131.</ref> While Lady Alicia Blackwood later recalled that Seacole had \"...&nbsp;personally spared no pains and no exertion to visit the field of woe, and minister with her own hands such things as could comfort or alleviate the suffering of those around her; freely giving to such as could not pay&nbsp;...\".<ref>Lady Alicia Blackwood, ''A Narrative of Personal Experiences and Impressions during a Residence on the Bosphorus throughout the Crimean War'', 1881; quoted in Alexander & Dewjee, p. 28.</ref>\n\nHer peers, though wary at first, soon found out how important Seacole was for both medical assistance and morale. One British medical officers described Seacole in his memoir as \"The acquaintance of a celebrated person, Mrs. Seacole, a coloured women who out of the goodness of her heart and at her own expense, supplied hot tea to the poor sufferers [wounded men being transported from the peninsula to the hospital at Scutari ] while they are waiting to be lifted into the boats\u2026. She did not spare herself if she could do any good to the suffering soldiers. In rain and snow, in storm and tempest, day after day she was at her self-chosen post with her stove and kettle, in any shelter she could find, brewing tea for all who wanted it, and they were many. Sometimes more than 200 sick would be embarked in one day, but Mrs. Seacole was always equal, to the occasion\". But Seacole did more than carry tea to the suffering soldiers. She often carried bags of lint, bandages, needles and thread to tend to the wounds of soldiers.<ref name=\"nlj.gov.jm\"/>\n\nIn late August, Seacole was on the route to Cathcart's Hill for the final assault on Sevastopol on 7 September 1855. French troops led the storming, but the British were beaten back. By dawn on Sunday 9 September, the city was burning out of control, and it was clear that it had fallen: the Russians retreated to fortifications to the north of the harbour. Later in the day, Seacole fulfilled a bet, and became the first British woman to enter Sevastopol after it fell.<ref name=\"SeacoleXVII\">Seacole, Chapter XVII.</ref> Having obtained a pass, she toured the broken town, bearing refreshments and visiting the crowded hospital by the docks, containing thousands of dead and dying Russians. Her foreign appearance led to her being stopped by French looters, but she was rescued by a passing officer. She looted some items from the city, including a church bell, an altar candle, and a three-metre (10&nbsp;ft) long painting of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]].<ref name=\"SeacoleXVII\" /><ref>Robinson, p. 138.</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of Sevastopol, hostilities continued in a desultory fashion.<ref name=\"SeacoleXVIII\">Seacole, Chapter XVIII.</ref> The business of Seacole and Day prospered in the interim period, with the officers taking the opportunity to enjoy themselves in the quieter days.<ref>Robinson, p. 145.</ref> There were theatrical performances and horse-racing events for which Seacole provided catering.<ref>Robinson, pp. 146\u201347.</ref>\n\nSeacole was joined by a 14-year-old girl, Sarah, also known as Sally. Soyer described her as \"the Egyptian beauty, Mrs Seacole's daughter Sarah\", with blue eyes and dark hair. Nightingale alleged that Sarah was the illegitimate offspring of Seacole and Colonel [[Sir Henry Bunbury, 7th Baronet|Henry Bunbury]]. However, there is no evidence that Bunbury met Seacole, or even visited Jamaica, at a time when she would have been nursing her ailing husband.<ref>Robinson, p. 155.</ref> Ramdin speculates that Thomas Day could have been Sarah's father, pointing to the unlikely coincidences of their meeting in Panama and then in England, and their unusual business partnership in Crimea.<ref>Ramdin, pp. 120\u201323.</ref>\n\nPeace talks began in Paris in early 1856, and friendly relations opened between the Allies and the Russians, with a lively trade across the River Tchernaya.<ref name=\"SeacoleXIX\">Seacole, Chapter XIX.</ref> The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed on 30 March 1856, after which the soldiers left Crimea.

Elm House, 25 July 1857, pg. 105.</ref>\n\nSociology professor Lynn McDonald is co-founder of The [[Nightingale Society]], which promotes the legacy of Nightingale, who did not see eye-to-eye with Seacole. McDonald believes that Seacole's role in the Crimean War was overplayed:<ref>TLS, 6 Dec 2013 p.24</ref>\n\n{{quote|Mary Seacole, although never the 'black British nurse' she is claimed to have been, was a successful mixed-race immigrant to Britain.   She led an adventurous life, and her memoir of 1857 is still a lively read.   She was kind and generous.   She made friends of her customers, army and navy officers, who came to her rescue with a fund when she was declared bankrupt.   While her cures have been vastly exaggerated, she doubtless did what she could to ease suffering, when no effective cures existed.   In epidemics pre-Crimea, she said a comforting word to the dying and closed the eyes of the dead.   During the Crimean War, probably her greatest kindness was to serve hot tea and lemonade to cold, suffering soldiers awaiting transport to hospital on the wharf at Balaclava.   She deserves much credit for rising to the occasion, but her tea and lemonade did not save lives, pioneer nursing or advance health care.}}\n\nHowever, historians maintain that claims that Seacole only served \"tea and lemonade\" do a disservice to the tradition of Jamaican \"doctresses\", such as Seacole's mother, [[Cubah Cornwallis]], Sarah Adams and Grace Donne, who cared for Jamaica's wealthiest planter of the 18th century, [[Simon Taylor (sugar planter)]]. They all used herbal remedies and hygienic practices in the late eighteenth century, long before Nightingale took up the mantle. Social historian Jane Robinson argues in her book ''Mary Seacole: The Black Woman who invented Modern Nursing'' that Seacole was a huge success, and she became known and loved by everyone from the rank and file to the royal family.<ref>[https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781845294977 ''MARY SEACOLE'' by Jane Robinson] at Little, Brown.</ref><ref>Elizabeth Anwionwu, [http://www.mixedracestudies.org/?tag=mary-jane-grant-seacole \"Scotching Three Myths About Mary Seacole\"], ''British Journal of Healthcare Assistants'', Vol. 7, Issue 10 (October 2013), pp. 508\u2013511.

In the conclusion to her autobiography, she records that she \"took the opportunity\" to visit \"yet other lands\" on her return journey, although Robinson attributes this to her impecunious state requiring a roundabout trip. She arrived in August 1856 and opened a canteen with Day at [[Aldershot]], but the venture failed through lack of funds.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-41194 Mary Jane Seacole - [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] 2006]</ref> She attended a celebratory dinner for 2,000&nbsp;soldiers at [[Royal Surrey Gardens]] in [[Kennington]] on 25 August 1856, at which Nightingale was chief guest of honour. Reports in ''The Times'' on 26 August and ''[[News of the World]]'' on 31 August indicate that Seacole was also f\u00eated by the huge crowds, with two \"burly\" sergeants protecting her from the pressure of the crowd. However, creditors who had supplied her firm in Crimea were in pursuit. She was forced to move to 1, Tavistock Street, [[Covent Garden]] in increasingly dire financial straits. The Bankruptcy Court in [[Basinghall Street]] declared her [[bankrupt]] on 7 November 1856.<ref>Robinson, pp. 157, 160.</ref> Robinson speculates that Seacole's business problems may have been caused in part by her partner, Day, who dabbled in [[horse trading]] and may have set up as an unofficial bank, cashing debts.<ref>Robinson, p. 159.</ref>\n\nAt about this time, Seacole began to wear [[Military orders, awards and decorations|military medals]].

However, no formal notice of her award exists in the ''[[London Gazette]]'', and it seems unlikely that Seacole was formally rewarded for her actions in Crimea; rather, she may have bought miniature or \"dress\" medals to display her support and affection for her \"sons\" in the Army.<ref name=\"robinson167\" /><ref>Christodoulou, Glenn, \"Honouring Seacole\", ''[[History Today]]'', March 2005.</ref>\n\nSeacole's plight was highlighted in the British press.<ref name=\"TVU\"/> As a consequence a fund was set up, to which many prominent people donated money, and on 30 January 1857, she and Day were granted certificates discharging them from bankruptcy.<ref>Robinson, p. 166.</ref> Day left for the Antipodes to seek new opportunities,<ref>Seacole, Conclusion.</ref> but Seacole's funds remained low.

After quoting her letter in full the magazine provides a satiric cartoon of the activity she describes, captioned \"Our Own [[Vivandi\u00e8re]],\" describing Seacole as a female sutler. The article observes, \"It will be evident, from the foregoing, that Mother Seacole has sunk much lower in the world, and is also in danger of rising much higher in it, than is consistent with the honour of the British army, and the generosity of the British public.\" While urging the public to donate, the commentary's tone can be read as ironic: \"Who would give a guinea to see a mimic-sutler woman, and a foreigner, frisk and amble about on the stage, when he might bestow the money on a genuine English one, reduced to a two-pair back, and in imminent danger of being obliged to climb into an attic?\"<ref>\"Our Own Vivandi\u00e8re.\" ''Punch''. 30 May 1857, pg. 221.</ref>\n[[File:MarySeacole Punch.jpg|thumb|Mary Seacole, depicted as an admirer of ''Punch'' along with her British Crimean War patients in \"Our Own Vivandi\u00e8re\" (''Punch,'' 30 May 1857).]]\nFurther fund-raising and literary mentions kept Seacole in the public eye. In May 1857 she wanted to travel to India, to minister to the wounded of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], but she was dissuaded by both the new Secretary of War, [[Fox Maule-Ramsay, 11th Earl of Dalhousie|Lord Panmure]],<ref>Robinson, p. 179.</ref> and her financial troubles.<ref>Robinson, p. 169.</ref> Fund-raising activities included the \"Seacole Fund Grand Military Festival\", which was held at the [[Royal Surrey Gardens]], from Monday 27 July to Thursday 30 July 1857. This successful event was supported by many military men, including [[Major General]] [[Henry Montagu, 6th Baron Rokeby|Lord Rokeby]] (who had commanded the 1st Division in Crimea) and Lord [[George Augustus Frederick Paget|George Paget]]; more than 1,000&nbsp;artists performed, including 11&nbsp;military bands and an orchestra conducted by [[Louis Antoine Jullien]], which was attended by a crowd of circa 40,000.<ref>See account in Robinson, pp. 175\u201378.</ref> The one-shilling entrance charge was quintupled for the first night, and halved for the Tuesday performance. However, production costs had been high and the Royal Surrey Gardens Company was itself having financial problems. It became insolvent immediately after the festival, and as a result Seacole only received [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]57, one quarter of the profits from the event. When eventually the financial affairs of the ruined Company were resolved, in March 1858, the Indian Mutiny was over.<ref>Robinson, p. 180.</ref>  Writing of his 1859 journey to the West Indies, the British novelist [[Anthony Trollope]] described visiting Mrs. Seacole's sister's hotel in Kingston in his ''The West Indies and the Spanish Main'' (Chapman & Hall, 1850).

There, approximately {{convert|45|mi|km}} up the [[Chagres River]] from the coast, he followed the family trade by establishing the Independent Hotel to accommodate the many travellers between the eastern and western coasts of the United States (the number of travellers had increased enormously, as part of the 1849 [[California Gold Rush]]<ref>Robinson, p. 42.</ref>).

Seacole later expressed exasperation at their feeble resistance, claiming they \"bowed down before the plague in slavish despair\".<ref name=\"SeacoleIV\" /> She performed an [[autopsy]] on an orphan child for whom she had cared, which gave her \"decidedly useful\" new knowledge. At the end of this epidemic she herself contracted cholera, forcing her to rest for several weeks. In her autobiography, ''The Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands'', she describes how the residents of Cruces responded: \"When it became known that their \"yellow doctress\" had the cholera, I must do the people of Cruces the justice to say that they gave me plenty of sympathy, and would have shown their regard for me more actively, had there been any occasion.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands|last=Seacole|first=Mary|publisher=James Blackwood|year=1857|isbn=|location=London|pages=Chapter V}}</ref>\n\nCholera was to return again: [[Ulysses S. Grant]] passed through Cruces in July, 1852, on military duty; a hundred and twenty men, a third of his party, died of the disease there or shortly afterwards en route to Panama City.<ref name=\"robinson54\">Robinson, p. 54.</ref>\n\nDespite the problems of disease and climate, Panama remained the favoured route between the coasts of the United States. Seeing a business opportunity, Seacole opened the British Hotel, which was a restaurant rather than an hotel. She described it as a \"tumble down hut,\" with two rooms, the smaller one to be her bedroom, the larger one to serve up to 50 diners. She soon added the services of a barber.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs the wet season ended in early 1852, Seacole joined other traders in Cruces in packing up to move to Gorgona. She records a white American giving a speech at a leaving dinner in which he wished that \"God bless the best yaller woman he ever made\" and asked the listeners to join with him in rejoicing that \"she's so many shades removed from being entirely black\". He went on to say that \"if we could bleach her by any means we would&nbsp;[...] and thus make her acceptable in any company[,] as she deserves to be\".<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\">Seacole, Chapter VI.</ref> Seacole replied firmly that she did not \"appreciate your friend's kind wishes with respect to my complexion.

In late 1852, she travelled home to Jamaica. Already delayed, the journey was further made difficult when she encountered racial discrimination while trying to book passage on an American ship. She was forced to wait for a later British boat.<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" /> In 1853, soon after arriving home, Seacole was asked by the Jamaican medical authorities to minister to victims of a severe outbreak of [[yellow fever]].<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" />  She found that she could do little, because the epidemic was so severe. Her memoirs state that her own boarding house was full of sufferers and she saw many of them die. Although she wrote, \"I was sent for by the medical authorities to provide nurses for the sick at [[Up-Park Camp]],\" she did not claim to bring nurses with her when she went. She left her sister with some nurses at her house, went to the camp (about a mile, or 1.6&nbsp;km, from [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]), \"and did my best, but it was little we could do to mitigate the severity of the epidemic.\"<ref name=\"SeacoleVI\" />\n\nSeacole returned to Panama in early 1854 to finalise her business affairs, and three months later moved to the New Granada Mining Gold Company establishment at Fort Bowen Mine some {{convert|70|mi|km}} away near Escribanos.<ref name=\"SeacoleVII\">Seacole, Chapter VII.</ref> The superintendent, Thomas Day, was related to her late husband. Seacole had read newspaper reports of the outbreak of war against Russia before she left Jamaica, and news of the escalating [[Crimean War]] reached her in Panama. She determined to travel to England to volunteer as a nurse,<ref name=\"SeacoleVII\" /> to experience the \"pomp, pride and circumstance of glorious war\" as she described it in Chapter I of her autobiography. A part of her reasoning for going to the Crimean was that she knew some of the soldiers that were deployed there. In her autobiography she explains how she heard of soldiers that she had cared for in the 97th and 48th regiments were being shipped back to England in preparation for the fighting on the Crimean Peninsula.\n\n== Crimean War, 1853\u201356 ==\n[[File:Seacole simpson sketch.png|thumb|Sketch of Mary Seacole by Crimean [[war artist]] [[William Simpson (artist)|William Simpson]] (1823\u20131899), c.&nbsp;1855]]\nThe [[Crimean War]] lasted from October 1853 until 1 April 1856 and was fought between the [[Russian Empire]] and an alliance of the United Kingdom, [[Second French Empire|France]], the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The majority of the conflict took place on the [[Crimea|Crimean peninsula]] in the [[Black Sea]] and [[Turkey]].\n\nMany thousands of troops from all the countries involved were drafted to the area, and disease broke out almost immediately. Hundreds perished, mostly from Cholera. Hundreds more would die waiting to be shipped out, or on the voyage. Their prospects were little better when they arrived at the poorly staffed, unsanitary and overcrowded hospitals which were the only medical provision for the wounded. In Britain, a trenchant letter in ''[[The Times]]'' on 14 October triggered [[Sidney Herbert, 1st Baron Herbert of Lea|Sidney Herbert]], [[Secretary of State for War]], to approach [[Florence Nightingale]] to form a detachment of nurses to be sent to the hospital to save lives. Interviews were quickly held, suitable candidates selected, and Nightingale left for Turkey on 21 October.<ref>Robinson, pp. 85\u201387.</ref>\n\nSeacole travelled from Navy Bay in Panama to England, initially to deal with her investments in gold-mining businesses. She then attempted to join the second contingent of nurses to the Crimea. She applied to the War Office and other government offices, but arrangements for departure were already underway. In her memoir, she wrote that she brought \"ample testimony\" of her experience in nursing, but the only example officially cited was that of a former medical officer of the West Granada Gold-Mining Company. However, Seacole wrote that this was just one of the testimonials she had in her possession.<ref name=\"SeacoleVIII\">Seacole, Chapter VIII.</ref>  Seacole wrote in her autobiography, \"Now, I am not for a single instant going to blame the authorities who would not listen to the offer of a motherly yellow woman to go to the Crimea and nurse her \"sons\" there, suffering from cholera, diarrh\u0153a, and a host of lesser ills. In my country, where people know our use, it would have been different; but here it was natural enough \u2013 although I had references, and other voices spoke for me \u2013 that they should laugh, good-naturedly enough, at my offer.\"<ref>Mary Seacole, ''Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands'', Chapter VIII (London: James Blackwood, 1857), pp. 73-81.</ref>\n\nSeacole also applied to the Crimean Fund, a fund raised by public subscription to support the wounded in Crimea, for sponsorship to travel there, but she again met with refusal.<ref>Robinson, p. 90.</ref> Seacole questioned whether racism was a factor in her being turned down. She wrote in her autobiography, \"Was it possible that American prejudices against colour had some root here?

[[Business card]]s were printed and sent ahead to announce her intention to open an establishment, to be called the \"British Hotel\", near Balaclava, which would be \"a mess-table and comfortable quarters for sick and convalescent officers\".<ref name=\"SeacoleVIII\" /> Shortly afterwards, her Caribbean acquaintance, Thomas Day, arrived unexpectedly in London, and the two formed a partnership. They assembled a stock of supplies, and Seacole embarked on the Dutch screw-steamer ''Hollander'' on 27 January 1855 on its maiden voyage, to [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"SeacoleVIII\" /><ref>Robinson, p. 91.</ref> The ship called at [[Malta]], where Seacole encountered a doctor who had recently left [[\u00dcsk\u00fcdar|Scutari]]. He wrote her a [[letter of introduction]] to Nightingale.<ref name=\"SeacoleIX\">Seacole, Chapter IX.</ref>\n\nSeacole visited Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital in Scutari, where she asked for a bed for the night. Seacole wrote, \"Mrs. B. questions me very kindly, but with the same look of curiosity and surprise. What object has Mrs. Seacole in coming out? This is the purport of her questions. And I say, frankly, to be of use somewhere; for other considerations I had not, until necessity forced them upon me. Willingly, had they accepted me, I would have worked for the wounded, in return for bread and water. I fancy Mrs. B\u2014 thought that I sought for employment at Scutari, for she said, very kindly \u2013 \"Miss Nightingale has the entire management of our hospital staff, but I do not think that any vacancy \u2013 \"<ref>Seacole, ''Wonderful Adventures'', Chapter XI, pp. 82-91.</ref>\n\nSeacole interrupted Bracebridge to inform her that she intended to travel to Balaclava the next day to join her business partner. In her memoirs, she reported that her meeting with Nightingale was friendly, with Nightingale asking \"What do you want, Mrs. Seacole? Anything we can do for you? If it lies in my power, I shall be very happy.\"<ref name=\"SeacoleIX\">Seacole, Chapter IX.</ref> Seacole told her of her \"dread of the night journey by [[ca\u00efque|caique]]\" and the improbability of being able to find the ''Hollander'' in the dark. A bed was then found for her and breakfast sent her in the morning, with a \"kind message\" from Bracebridge. A footnote in the memoir states that Seacole subsequently \"saw much of Miss Nightingale at Balaclava,\" but no further meetings are recorded in the text.\n\nAfter transferring most of her stores to the transport ship ''Albatross'', with the remainder following on the ''Nonpareil'', she set out on the four-day voyage to the British bridgehead into Crimea at [[Balaklava|Balaclava]].<ref name=\"SeacoleX\">Seacole, Chapter X.</ref>\n\nLacking proper building materials, Seacole gathered abandoned metal and wood in her spare moments, with a view to using the debris to build her hotel. She found a site for the hotel at a place she christened Spring Hill, near [[Kadikoi]], some {{convert|3+1/2|mi|km}} along the main British supply road from Balaclava to the British camp near [[Sevastopol]], and within a mile of the British headquarters.<ref name=\"SeacoleXI\">Seacole, Chapter XI.</ref>\n\nThe hotel was built from the salvaged driftwood, packing cases, iron sheets, and salvaged architectural items such as glass doors and window-frames, from the village of Kamara, using hired local labour.<ref name=\"SeacoleXI\" /> The new British Hotel opened in March 1855. An early visitor was [[Alexis Soyer]], a noted French chef who had travelled to Crimea to help improve the diet of British soldiers. He records meeting Seacole in his 1857 work ''A Culinary Campaign'' and describes Seacole as \"an old dame of a jovial appearance, but a few shades darker than the white lily\".<ref>Quoted by Ramdin, p. 85.</ref> Seacole requested Soyer's advice on how to manage her business, and was advised to concentrate on food and beverage service, and not to have beds for visitors because the few either slept on board ships in the harbour or in tents in the camp.<ref name=\"Soyer\">Alexis Soyer, ''Soyer's Culinary Campaign'',(London: G. Routledge, 1857), p. 233.</ref>\n\nThe hotel was completed in July at a total cost of \u00a3800. It included a building made of iron, containing a main room with counters and shelves and storage above, an attached kitchen, two wooden sleeping huts, outhouses, and an enclosed stable-yard.<ref name=\"SeacoleXII\">Seacole, Chapter XII.</ref><ref>Robinson, p. 111.</ref> The building was stocked with provisions shipped from London and Constantinople, as well as local purchases from the British camp near Kadikoi and the French camp at nearby [[Gagarin Raion|Kamiesch]]. Seacole sold anything \u2013 \"from a needle to an anchor\"\u2014to army officers and visiting sightseers.<ref name=\"SeacoleXII\" /> Meals were served at the Hotel, cooked by two black cooks, and the kitchen also provided outside catering.\n\nDespite constant thefts, particularly of livestock, Seacole's establishment prospered. Chapter XIV of ''Wonderful Adventures'' describes the meals and supplies provided to officers. They were closed at 8 pm daily and on Sundays. Seacole did some of the cooking herself: \"Whenever I had a few leisure moments, I used to wash my hands, roll up my sleeves, and roll out pastry.\" When called to \"dispense medications,\" she did so.<ref name=\"SeacoleXIV\">Seacole, Chapter XIV.</ref> Soyer was a frequent visitor, and praised Seacole's offerings,<ref name=\"SeacoleXV\">Seacole, Chapter XV.</ref> noting that she offered him champagne on his first visit.<ref name=\"Soyer\" /> \n\nTo Soyer, near the time of departure, Florence Nightingale acknowledged favourable views of Seacole, consistent with their one known meeting in Scutari. Soyer's remarks\u2014he knew both women\u2014show pleasantness on both sides. Seacole told him of her encounter with Nightingale at the Barrack Hospital: \"You must know, M Soyer, that Miss Nightingale is very fond of me. When I passed through Scutari, she very kindly gave me board and lodging.\"<ref>Soyer, p. 434.</ref> When he related Seacole's inquiries to Nightingale, she replied \"with a smile: 'I should like to see her before she leaves, as I hear she has done a deal of good for the poor soldiers.'\"<ref>Soyer, p. 43.</ref> Nightingale, however, did not want her nurses associating with Seacole, as she wrote to her brother-in-law.<ref>Letter, 5 August 1870, Wellcome Ms 9004/60.</ref>\n\n[[File:SeacoleWar.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Map illustrating Mary Seacole's involvement in the Crimean War]]\nSeacole often went out to the troops as a [[sutler]],<ref name=BBC>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/seacole_mary.shtml|title=Mary Seacole (1805\u20131881)|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=c. 2005|accessdate=30 March 2008}}</ref> selling her provisions near the British camp at Kadikoi, and attending to casualties brought out from the trenches around Sevastopol or from the [[Battle of the Chernaya|Tchernaya valley]].<ref name=nuos/> She was widely known to the British Army as \"Mother Seacole\".<ref name=mixedfolks/>\n\nApart from serving officers at the British Hotel, Seacole also provided catering for spectators at the battles, and spent time on Cathcart's Hill, some {{convert|3+1/2|mi|km}} north of the British Hotel, as an observer. On one occasion, attending wounded troops under fire, she dislocated her right thumb, an injury which never healed entirely.<ref name=\"SeacoleXVI\">Seacole, Chapter XVI.</ref> In a dispatch written on 14 September 1855, [[William Howard Russell]], special correspondent of ''The Times'', wrote that she was a \"warm and successful physician, who doctors and cures all manner of men with extraordinary success. She is always in attendance near the battlefield to aid the wounded and has earned many a poor fellow's blessing.\" Russell also wrote that she \"redeemed the name of sutler\", and another that she was \"both a Miss Nightingale and a [chef]\". Seacole made a point of wearing brightly coloured, and highly conspicuous, clothing\u2014often bright blue, or yellow, with ribbons in contrasting colours.<ref>''The Times'', 26 September 1855, p. 6.</ref><ref>Robinson, p. 131.</ref> While Lady Alicia Blackwood later recalled that Seacole had \"...&nbsp;personally spared no pains and no exertion to visit the field of woe, and minister with her own hands such things as could comfort or alleviate the suffering of those around her; freely giving to such as could not pay&nbsp;...\".<ref>Lady Alicia Blackwood, ''A Narrative of Personal Experiences and Impressions during a Residence on the Bosphorus throughout the Crimean War'', 1881; quoted in Alexander & Dewjee, p. 28.</ref>\n\nHer peers, though wary at first, soon found out how important Seacole was for both medical assistance and morale. One British medical officers described Seacole in his memoir as \"The acquaintance of a celebrated person, Mrs. Seacole, a coloured women who out of the goodness of her heart and at her own expense, supplied hot tea to the poor sufferers [wounded men being transported from the peninsula to the hospital at Scutari ] while they are waiting to be lifted into the boats\u2026. She did not spare herself if she could do any good to the suffering soldiers. In rain and snow, in storm and tempest, day after day she was at her self-chosen post with her stove and kettle, in any shelter she could find, brewing tea for all who wanted it, and they were many. Sometimes more than 200 sick would be embarked in one day, but Mrs. Seacole was always equal, to the occasion\". But Seacole did more than carry tea to the suffering soldiers. She often carried bags of lint, bandages, needles and thread to tend to the wounds of soldiers.<ref name=\"nlj.gov.jm\"/>\n\nIn late August, Seacole was on the route to Cathcart's Hill for the final assault on Sevastopol on 7 September 1855. French troops led the storming, but the British were beaten back. By dawn on Sunday 9 September, the city was burning out of control, and it was clear that it had fallen: the Russians retreated to fortifications to the north of the harbour. Later in the day, Seacole fulfilled a bet, and became the first British woman to enter Sevastopol after it fell.<ref name=\"SeacoleXVII\">Seacole, Chapter XVII.</ref> Having obtained a pass, she toured the broken town, bearing refreshments and visiting the crowded hospital by the docks, containing thousands of dead and dying Russians. Her foreign appearance led to her being stopped by French looters, but she was rescued by a passing officer. She looted some items from the city, including a church bell, an altar candle, and a three-metre (10&nbsp;ft) long painting of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]].<ref name=\"SeacoleXVII\" /><ref>Robinson, p. 138.</ref>\n\nAfter the fall of Sevastopol, hostilities continued in a desultory fashion.<ref name=\"SeacoleXVIII\">Seacole, Chapter XVIII.</ref> The business of Seacole and Day prospered in the interim period, with the officers taking the opportunity to enjoy themselves in the quieter days.<ref>Robinson, p. 145.</ref> There were theatrical performances and horse-racing events for which Seacole provided catering.<ref>Robinson, pp. 146\u201347.</ref>\n\nSeacole was joined by a 14-year-old girl, Sarah, also known as Sally. Soyer described her as \"the Egyptian beauty, Mrs Seacole's daughter Sarah\", with blue eyes and dark hair. Nightingale alleged that Sarah was the illegitimate offspring of Seacole and Colonel [[Sir Henry Bunbury, 7th Baronet|Henry Bunbury]]. However, there is no evidence that Bunbury met Seacole, or even visited Jamaica, at a time when she would have been nursing her ailing husband.<ref>Robinson, p. 155.</ref> Ramdin speculates that Thomas Day could have been Sarah's father, pointing to the unlikely coincidences of their meeting in Panama and then in England, and their unusual business partnership in Crimea.<ref>Ramdin, pp. 120\u201323.</ref>\n\nPeace talks began in Paris in early 1856, and friendly relations opened between the Allies and the Russians, with a lively trade across the River Tchernaya.<ref name=\"SeacoleXIX\">Seacole, Chapter XIX.</ref> The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed on 30 March 1856, after which the soldiers left Crimea. Seacole was in a difficult financial position, her business was full of unsaleable provisions, new goods were arriving daily, and creditors were demanding payment.<ref name=\"SeacoleXIX\" /> She attempted to sell as much as possible before the soldiers left, but she was forced to auction many expensive goods for lower-than-expected prices to the Russians who were returning to their homes. The evacuation of the Allied armies was formally completed at Balaclava on 9 July 1856, with Seacole \"...&nbsp;conspicuous in the foreground&nbsp;...&nbsp;dressed in a plaid riding-habit&nbsp;...\".<ref>Robinson, p. 153, quoting the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 30 August 1856.</ref> Seacole was one of the last to leave Crimea, returning to England \"poorer than [she] left it\".<ref name=\"SeacoleXIX\" /> Though she had left poorer, her impact on the soldiers was invaluable to the soldiers she treated, changing their perceptions about her as described in ''the Illustrated London News:'' \"Perhaps at first the authorities looked askant at the woman-volunteer; but they soon found her worth and utility; and from that time until the British army left the Crimea, Mother Seacole was a household word in the camp...In her store on Spring Hill she attended many patients, nursed many sick, and earned the good will and gratitude of hundreds\".<ref name=\":1\">Literature Review. ''The Illustrated London News.'' Elm House, 25 July 1857, pg. 105.</ref>\n\nSociology professor Lynn McDonald is co-founder of The [[Nightingale Society]], which promotes the legacy of Nightingale, who did not see eye-to-eye with Seacole. McDonald believes that Seacole's role in the Crimean War was overplayed:<ref>TLS, 6 Dec 2013 p.24</ref>\n\n{{quote|Mary Seacole, although never the 'black British nurse' she is claimed to have been, was a successful mixed-race immigrant to Britain.   She led an adventurous life, and her memoir of 1857 is still a lively read.   She was kind and generous.   She made friends of her customers, army and navy officers, who came to her rescue with a fund when she was declared bankrupt.   While her cures have been vastly exaggerated, she doubtless did what she could to ease suffering, when no effective cures existed.   In epidemics pre-Crimea, she said a comforting word to the dying and closed the eyes of the dead.   During the Crimean War, probably her greatest kindness was to serve hot tea and lemonade to cold, suffering soldiers awaiting transport to hospital on the wharf at Balaclava.   She deserves much credit for rising to the occasion, but her tea and lemonade did not save lives, pioneer nursing or advance health care.}}\n\nHowever, historians maintain that claims that Seacole only served \"tea and lemonade\" do a disservice to the tradition of Jamaican \"doctresses\", such as Seacole's mother, [[Cubah Cornwallis]], Sarah Adams and Grace Donne, who cared for Jamaica's wealthiest planter of the 18th century, [[Simon Taylor (sugar planter)]]. They all used herbal remedies and hygienic practices in the late eighteenth century, long before Nightingale took up the mantle. Social historian Jane Robinson argues in her book ''Mary Seacole: The Black Woman who invented Modern Nursing'' that Seacole was a huge success, and she became known and loved by everyone from the rank and file to the royal family.<ref>[https://www.littlebrown.co.uk/books/detail.page?isbn=9781845294977 ''MARY SEACOLE'' by Jane Robinson] at Little, Brown.</ref><ref>Elizabeth Anwionwu, [http://www.mixedracestudies.org/?tag=mary-jane-grant-seacole \"Scotching Three Myths About Mary Seacole\"], ''British Journal of Healthcare Assistants'', Vol. 7, Issue 10 (October 2013), pp. 508\u2013511.

In the conclusion to her autobiography, she records that she \"took the opportunity\" to visit \"yet other lands\" on her return journey, although Robinson attributes this to her impecunious state requiring a roundabout trip. She arrived in August 1856 and opened a canteen with Day at [[Aldershot]], but the venture failed through lack of funds.<ref>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-41194 Mary Jane Seacole - [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] 2006]</ref> She attended a celebratory dinner for 2,000&nbsp;soldiers at [[Royal Surrey Gardens]] in [[Kennington]] on 25 August 1856, at which Nightingale was chief guest of honour.

However, creditors who had supplied her firm in Crimea were in pursuit. She was forced to move to 1, Tavistock Street, [[Covent Garden]] in increasingly dire financial straits. The Bankruptcy Court in [[Basinghall Street]] declared her [[bankrupt]] on 7 November 1856.<ref>Robinson, pp. 157, 160.</ref> Robinson speculates that Seacole's business problems may have been caused in part by her partner, Day, who dabbled in [[horse trading]] and may have set up as an unofficial bank, cashing debts.<ref>Robinson, p. 159.</ref>\n\nAt about this time, Seacole began to wear [[Military orders, awards and decorations|military medals]]. These are mentioned in an account of her appearance in the bankruptcy court in November 1856.<ref name=\"robinson167\">Robinson, p.167.</ref> A bust by [[George \"Fowokan\" Kelly|George Kelly]], based on an original by [[Prince Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg|Count Gleichen]] from around 1871, depicts her wearing four medals, three of which have been identified as the British [[Crimea Medal]], the French [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur]] and the Turkish Order of the [[Medjidie]] medal. Robinson says that one is \"apparently\" a Sardinian award ([[Sardinia]] having joined Britain and France in supporting Turkey against Russia in the war).<ref name=\"robinson167\" /> The Jamaican ''[[Gleaner Company|Daily Gleaner]]'' stated in her obituary on 9 June 1881 that she had also received a Russian medal, but it has not been identified. However, no formal notice of her award exists in the ''[[London Gazette]]'', and it seems unlikely that Seacole was formally rewarded for her actions in Crimea; rather, she may have bought miniature or \"dress\" medals to display her support and affection for her \"sons\" in the Army.<ref name=\"robinson167\" /><ref>Christodoulou, Glenn, \"Honouring Seacole\", ''[[History Today]]'', March 2005.</ref>\n\nSeacole's plight was highlighted in the British press.<ref name=\"TVU\"/> As a consequence a fund was set up, to which many prominent people donated money, and on 30 January 1857, she and Day were granted certificates discharging them from bankruptcy.<ref>Robinson, p. 166.</ref> Day left for the Antipodes to seek new opportunities,<ref>Seacole, Conclusion.</ref> but Seacole's funds remained low.

After quoting her letter in full the magazine provides a satiric cartoon of the activity she describes, captioned \"Our Own [[Vivandi\u00e8re]],\" describing Seacole as a female sutler. The article observes, \"It will be evident, from the foregoing, that Mother Seacole has sunk much lower in the world, and is also in danger of rising much higher in it, than is consistent with the honour of the British army, and the generosity of the British public.\" While urging the public to donate, the commentary's tone can be read as ironic: \"Who would give a guinea to see a mimic-sutler woman, and a foreigner, frisk and amble about on the stage, when he might bestow the money on a genuine English one, reduced to a two-pair back, and in imminent danger of being obliged to climb into an attic?\"<ref>\"Our Own Vivandi\u00e8re.\" ''Punch''. 30 May 1857, pg. 221.</ref>\n[[File:MarySeacole Punch.jpg|thumb|Mary Seacole, depicted as an admirer of ''Punch'' along with her British Crimean War patients in \"Our Own Vivandi\u00e8re\" (''Punch,'' 30 May 1857).]]\nFurther fund-raising and literary mentions kept Seacole in the public eye. In May 1857 she wanted to travel to India, to minister to the wounded of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]], but she was dissuaded by both the new Secretary of War, [[Fox Maule-Ramsay, 11th Earl of Dalhousie|Lord Panmure]],<ref>Robinson, p. 179.</ref> and her financial troubles.<ref>Robinson, p. 169.</ref> Fund-raising activities included the \"Seacole Fund Grand Military Festival\", which was held at the [[Royal Surrey Gardens]], from Monday 27 July to Thursday 30 July 1857. This successful event was supported by many military men, including [[Major General]] [[Henry Montagu, 6th Baron Rokeby|Lord Rokeby]] (who had commanded the 1st Division in Crimea) and Lord [[George Augustus Frederick Paget|George Paget]]; more than 1,000&nbsp;artists performed, including 11&nbsp;military bands and an orchestra conducted by [[Louis Antoine Jullien]], which was attended by a crowd of circa 40,000.<ref>See account in Robinson, pp. 175\u201378.</ref> The one-shilling entrance charge was quintupled for the first night, and halved for the Tuesday performance. However, production costs had been high and the Royal Surrey Gardens Company was itself having financial problems. It became insolvent immediately after the festival, and as a result Seacole only received [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]57, one quarter of the profits from the event. When eventually the financial affairs of the ruined Company were resolved, in March 1858, the Indian Mutiny was over.<ref>Robinson, p. 180.</ref>  Writing of his 1859 journey to the West Indies, the British novelist [[Anthony Trollope]] described visiting Mrs. Seacole's sister's hotel in Kingston in his ''The West Indies and the Spanish Main'' (Chapman & Hall, 1850). Besides remarking on the black servants' pride and insistence that they be treated politely by guests, Trollope remarked that his hostess, \"though clean and reasonable in her charges, clung with touching tenderness to the idea that beefsteak and onions, and bread and cheese and beer, comprised the only diet proper to an Englishman.\"<ref>\"Reviews.\" ''The Literary Gazette.''

However, in recent years there has been a resurgence of interest in her and efforts to properly acknowledge her achievements. Seacole has become a case study of racial attitudes and social injustices in Britain in the nineteenth century. She was cited as an example of \"hidden\" black history in [[Salman Rushdie]]'s ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'' (1988), like [[Olaudah Equiano]]: \"See, here is Mary Seacole, who did as much in the Crimea as another magic-lamping lady, but, being dark, could scarce be seen for the flame of Florence's candle.\"<ref>[[Salman Rushdie]], ''[[The Satanic Verses]]'', Vintage, p. 292, quoted in Salih, p. xv.</ref>\n\nShe has been better remembered in the Caribbean, where significant buildings were named after her in the 1950s: the headquarters of the Jamaican General Trained Nurses' Association was christened \"Mary Seacole House\" in 1954, followed quickly by the naming of a hall of residence of the [[University of the West Indies]] in [[Mona, Jamaica]],<ref name=\"robinson199\">Robinson, p. 199.</ref> and a ward at Kingston Public Hospital was also named in her memory.<ref>Alexander & Dewjee, p. 40.</ref> More than a century after her death, Seacole was awarded the [[Jamaican Order of Merit]] in 1991.\n\nHer grave in London was rediscovered in 1973; a service of reconsecration was held on 20 November 1973, and her impressive gravestone was also restored by the British Commonwealth Nurses' War Memorial Fund and the Lignum Vitae Club.

According to the writer Helen Rappaport, in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the West African and Jamaican creole \"doctress\", such as Cornwallis and Sarah Adams, who both died in the late 1840s, often had greater success than the European-trained doctor who practised what was then traditional medicine. These doctresses of Jamaica practised hygiene long before Nightingale adopted it as one of her key reforms in her book [[Notes on Nursing]] in 1859. It is possible that Nightingale learned about the value of hygiene in nursing from the practices of Seacole.<ref>Helen Rappaport, https://helenrappaport.com/footnotes/mary-seacole-creole-doctress-nurse/ \"Mary Seacole: Creole Doctress, Nurse and Healer\".]</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/NotesOnNursingByFlorenceNightingale/page/n4 \"notes on nursing by florence nightingale\"] at Internet Archive.</ref><ref>Richard Hill, [https://archive.org/details/aweekatportroya00hillgoog/page/n90 <!-- pg=4 --> ''A Week at Port Royal''] (1855).
