He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era, one whose \"poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation.\"<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 284.</ref>\n\nChopin was born '''Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin''' in the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and grew up in [[Warsaw]], which in 1815 became part of [[Congress Poland]]. A [[child prodigy]], he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]]. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter\u2014in the last 18 years of his life\u2014he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]. He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with [[Franz Liszt]] and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries (including [[Robert Schumann]]). \n\nAfter a failed engagement to [[Maria Wodzi\u0144ska]] from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin (known by her pen name, [[George Sand]]). A brief and unhappy visit to [[Majorca]] with Sand in 1838\u201339 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer [[Jane Stirling]], who also arranged for him to visit [[Scotland]] in 1848. For most of his life, Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39, probably of [[pericarditis]] aggravated by [[tuberculosis]].\n\nAll of Chopin's compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two [[piano concerto]]s, a few [[chamber music|chamber pieces]], and some 19 [[Polish songs (Chopin)|songs set to Polish lyrics]]. His piano writing was technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument: his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of the [[ballade (classical music)#Instrumental ballades|instrumental ''ballade'']]. His major piano works also include [[mazurka]]s, [[waltz]]es, [[nocturne]]s, [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]]s, [[\u00e9tude]]s, [[impromptu]]s, [[scherzo]]s, [[prelude (music)|preludes]] and [[sonata]]s, some published only posthumously. Among the influences on his style of composition were Polish [[folk music]], the [[classical music|classical tradition]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.&nbsp;S. Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and the atmosphere of the Paris salons of which he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, [[harmony]], and [[musical form]], and his association of music with [[nationalism]], were influential throughout and after the late [[romanticism|Romantic]] period.\n\nChopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest superstars, his (indirect) association with political insurrection, his high-profile love-life, and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of [[#In literature, stage, film and television|numerous films and biographies]] of varying historical fidelity.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Manor house in \u017belazowa Wola.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Chopin's birthplace in [[\u017belazowa Wola]]]]\n\nFryderyk Chopin was born in [[\u017belazowa Wola]],<ref name=\"Zamoyski (2010), pp. 4\u20135 \">Zamoyski (2010), pp. 4\u20135 (locs. 115\u2013130).</ref> 46 kilometres ({{convert|46|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) west of Warsaw, in what was then the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a Polish state established by [[Napoleon]].

Fryderyk and his family moved to a building, which still survives, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace. During this period, Fryderyk was sometimes invited to the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]] as playmate to the son of the ruler of [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]], [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia]]; he played the piano for Constantine Pavlovich and composed a march for him.

In the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the [[Silesia]]n composer [[J\u00f3zef Elsner]] at the [[Fryderyk Chopin University of Music|Warsaw Conservatory]], studying [[music theory]], [[figured bass]], and [[musical composition|composition]].<ref name=\"Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a71, para. 5\">Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a71, para. 5.</ref>{{refn|The Conservatory was affiliated with the [[University of Warsaw]]; hence Chopin is counted among the [[University of Warsaw#Notable alumni|university's alumni]].|group=n}} Throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw. He was engaged by the inventors of the \"aeolomelodicon\" (a combination of piano and mechanical organ), and on this instrument, in May 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by [[Ignaz Moscheles|Moscheles]]. The success of this concert led to an invitation to give a recital on a similar instrument (the \"aeolopantaleon\") before [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]], who was visiting Warsaw; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring. At a subsequent aeolopantaleon concert on 10 June 1825, Chopin performed his [[Rondo in C minor (Chopin)|Rondo Op. 1]].

His next choice was Paris; difficulties obtaining a visa from Russian authorities resulted in him getting transit permission from the French. In later years he would quote the passport's endorsement ''Passeport en passant par Paris \u00e0 Londres'' (\"In transit to London via Paris\"), joking that he was in the city \"only in passing.\"<ref>Walker (2018), p. 202.</ref>\n\nChopin arrived in Paris in late September 1831; he would never return to Poland,<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d), \u00a71, para. 6.</ref> thus becoming one of many expatriates of the Polish [[Great Emigration]]. In France, he used the French versions of his given names, and after receiving French citizenship in 1835, he travelled on a French passport.<ref>A French passport used by Chopin is shown at Emmanuel Langavant, ''[http://diaph16.free.fr/chopin//chopin7.htm Passeport fran\u00e7ais de Chopin]'', Chopin&nbsp;\u2013 musicien fran\u00e7ais website, accessed 13 August 2014.</ref> However, Chopin remained close to his fellow Poles in exile as friends and confidants and he never felt fully comfortable speaking French. Chopin's biographer [[Adam Zamoyski]] writes that he never considered himself to be French, despite his father's French origins, and always saw himself as a Pole.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 128 (loc. 2027).</ref>\n\nIn Paris, Chopin encountered artists and other distinguished figures and found many opportunities to exercise his talents and achieve celebrity. During his years in Paris, he was to become acquainted with, among many others, [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Ferdinand Hiller]], [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], and [[Alfred de Vigny]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 106 (loc. 1678).</ref> Chopin was also acquainted with the poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]], principal of the Polish Literary Society, some of whose verses he set as songs.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 137 (loc. 2164).</ref>\n\nTwo Polish friends in Paris were also to play important roles in Chopin's life there. His fellow student at the Warsaw Conservatory, Julian Fontana, had originally tried unsuccessfully to establish himself in England; Fontana was to become, in the words of Micha\u0142owski and Samson, Chopin's \"general [[servant|factotum]] and copyist\".<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d), \u00a73, para. 2.</ref>  [[Wojciech Grzyma\u0142a|Albert Grzyma\u0142a]], who in Paris became a wealthy financier and society figure, often acted as Chopin's adviser and \"gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [his] life.\"<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;106\u201307 (locs. 1678\u20131696).</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1831, Chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when [[Robert Schumann]], reviewing the Op. 2 Variations in the ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' (his first published article on music), declared: \"Hats off, gentlemen! A genius.\"<ref>Schumann (1988), pp. 15\u201317.</ref> On 25 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert in the \"salons de MM Pleyel\u201c 9 rue Cadet  which drew universal admiration. The critic [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis]] wrote in the ''[[Revue et gazette musicale]]'': \"Here is a young man who&nbsp;... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music,&nbsp;... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else&nbsp;...\"<ref>cited in Zamoyski (2010), p. 88 (loc. 1384).</ref> After this concert, Chopin realised that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private [[salon (gathering)|salons]] (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite).<ref name=\"rjsfih\"/> By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832, he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d), \u00a72, paras. 4\u20135.</ref> This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked.<ref name=\"rjsfih\"/>\n\n[[File:Maria Wodzi\u0144ska.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Maria Wodzi\u0144ska]], self-portrait]]\nChopin seldom performed publicly in Paris. In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred. He played more frequently at salons but preferred playing at his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends. The musicologist [[Arthur Hedley]] has observed that \"As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances\u2014few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime.\"<ref>Hedley (2005), pp. 263\u201364.</ref> The list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts indicates the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period. Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt, and Hiller performed (on pianos) a [[Harpsichord concertos (J. S. Bach)#Concertos for three harpsichords|concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards]]; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil [[Adolphe Gutmann]], [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], and Alkan's teacher [[Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmermann|Joseph Zimmermann]] performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|7th symphony]].<ref>Conway (2012), p. 226 and n. 9.</ref> Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's ''[[Hexameron (musical composition)|Hexameron]]''; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s theme. Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with [[Maurice Schlesinger]], who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d), \u00a72, para. 5. For Schlesinger's international network see Conway (2012), pp. 185\u201387, 238\u201339.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in [[Aachen|Aix-la-Chapelle]] with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]], director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as [[Karl Friedrich Lessing|Lessing]], [[Eduard Bendemann|Bendemann]], [[Eduard Hildebrandt|Hildebrandt]] and [[Karl Ferdinand Sohn|Sohn]].<ref>Niecks (1980), p. 313.</ref> In 1835 Chopin went to [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]], where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter [[Maria Wodzi\u0144ska|Maria]] in Poland five years earlier when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via [[Leipzig]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;118\u201319 (locs. 1861\u20131878).</ref> The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses.<ref name=\"demonstrated\"/> In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, [[Clara Schumann|Clara Wieck]] and Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio ''[[St. Paul (oratorio)|St. Paul]]'', and who considered him \"a perfect musician\".<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;119\u201320 (locs. 1878\u20131896).</ref> In July 1836 Chopin travelled to [[Marienbad]] and [[Dresden]] to be with the Wodzi\u0144ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his [[Ballades (Chopin)#Ballade No. 1|G minor Ballade]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;126\u201327 (locs. 1983\u20132001).</ref> At the end of 1836, he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 [[Nocturnes, Op. 27 (Chopin)#Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1|Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1]].<ref>Jachimecki (1937), p. 423.</ref> The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.<ref>Chopin (1962), p. 144.</ref>\n\n===Franz Liszt===\n[[File:Franz-liszt-in-hungarian-costume-watercolour-by-josef-friehuber-1838.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Franz Liszt]], [[watercolor]] by [[Josef Kriehuber]], 1838]]\nAlthough it is not known exactly when Chopin first met [[Franz Liszt]] after arriving in Paris, on 12 December 1831 he mentioned in a letter to his friend Woyciechowski that \"I have met [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Luigi Cherubini|Cherubini]], [[Pierre Baillot|Baillot]], etc.\u2014also [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner|Kalkbrenner]]. You would not believe how curious I was about [[Henri Herz|Herz]], Liszt, Hiller, etc.\"<ref>Hall-Swadley (2011), p. 31.</ref> Liszt was in attendance at Chopin's Parisian debut on 26 February 1832 at the Salle Pleyel, which led him to remark: \"The most vigorous applause seemed not to suffice to our enthusiasm in the presence of this talented musician, who revealed a new phase of poetic sentiment combined with such happy innovation in the form of his art.\"<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/>\n\nThe two became friends, and for many years lived close to each other in Paris, Chopin at 38 [[Rue de la Chauss\u00e9e-d'Antin]], and Liszt at the H\u00f4tel de France on the Rue Lafitte, a few blocks away.<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\"/> They performed together on seven occasions between 1833 and 1841. The first, on 2 April 1833, was at a benefit concert organised by Hector Berlioz for his bankrupt Shakespearean actress wife [[Harriet Smithson]], during which they played [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]]'s ''Sonata in F minor'' for piano duet.<ref name=\"Hall 32\">Hall-Swadley (2011), p. 32.</ref> Later joint appearances included a benefit concert for the Benevolent Association of Polish Ladies in Paris.<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/> Their last appearance together in public was for a charity concert conducted for the [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn, held at the Salle Pleyel and the Paris Conservatory on 25 and 26 April 1841.<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/>\n\nAlthough the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship. [[Harold C. Schonberg]] believes that Chopin displayed a \"tinge of jealousy and spite\" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano,<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\">Schonberg (1987), p. 151.</ref> and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success.<ref>Hall-Swadley (2011), p. 33.</ref>  Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 \u00c9tudes, and his performance of them  prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\"<ref name=\"Walker 1988 184\">Walker (1988), p. 184.</ref> However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\".<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\"/> Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress [[Marie d'Agoult]]'s obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with [[George Sand]].<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/>\n\n===George Sand===\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 043.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Chopin at 28, from [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s [[Portrait of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and George Sand|joint portrait of Chopin and Sand]], 1838]]\nIn 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\"/> Short (under five feet, or 152&nbsp;cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker,<ref>Schonberg (1987), p. 152.</ref> she initially repelled Chopin, who remarked, \"What an unattractive person ''la Sand'' is.

After a solo recital in Paris on 21 February 1842, he wrote to Grzyma\u0142a:  \"I have to lie in bed all day long, my mouth and tonsils are aching so much.\"<ref>Zamoyski (2010) p. 212 (loc. 3331).</ref> He was forced by illness to decline a written invitation from Alkan to participate in a repeat performance of the Beethoven Seventh Symphony arrangement at \u00c9rard's on 1 March 1843.<ref>Eddie (2013), p. 8.</ref> Late in 1844, [[Charles Hall\u00e9]] visited Chopin and found him \"hardly able to move, bent like a half-opened penknife and evidently in great pain\", although his spirits returned when he started to play the piano for his visitor.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 227 (loc. 3571).</ref> Chopin's health continued to deteriorate, particularly from this time onwards. Modern research suggests that apart from any other illnesses, he may also have suffered from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]].<ref>Sara Reardon, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/31/AR2011013104713.html \"Chopin's hallucinations may have been caused by epilepsy\"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', 31 January 2011, accessed 10 January 2014.</ref>\n\nChopin's relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and Solange's fianc\u00e9, the young fortune-hunting sculptor [[Auguste Cl\u00e9singer]].<ref name=\"MichaowskiSamson\">Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a75, para. 2.</ref> The composer frequently took Solange's side in quarrels with her mother; he also faced jealousy from Sand's son Maurice.<ref>Samson (1996), p. 194.</ref> Chopin was utterly indifferent to Sand's radical political  pursuits, while Sand looked on his society friends with disdain.<ref name=\"Chen 32\">Chen (2009), p. 32.</ref> As the composer's illness progressed, Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin, whom she called her \"third child\". In letters to third parties, she vented her impatience, referring to him as a \"child,\" a \"little angel\", a \"sufferer\" and a \"beloved little corpse.\"<ref name=\"gredxn\"/> In 1847 Sand published her novel ''Lucrezia Floriani'', whose main characters\u2014a rich actress and a prince in weak health\u2014could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin, who could not have missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the [[galley proof|printer's galleys]]. In 1847 he did not visit Nohant, and he quietly ended their ten-year relationship following an angry correspondence which, in Sand's words, made \"a strange conclusion to nine years of exclusive friendship.\"<ref name=\"MichaowskiSamson\" /> The two would never meet again.<ref name=\"Chen 34\">Chen (2009), p. 34.</ref>\n\nChopin's output as a composer throughout this period declined in quantity year by year. Whereas in 1841 he had written a dozen works, only six were written in 1842 and six shorter pieces in 1843. In 1844 he wrote only the [[Piano Sonata No. 3 (Chopin)|Op. 58 sonata]]. 1845 saw the completion of three mazurkas (Op. 59). Although these works were more refined than many of his earlier compositions, Zamoyski concludes that \"his powers of concentration were failing and his inspiration was beset by anguish, both emotional and intellectual.\"<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 233 (loc. 3668).</ref>\n\n===Tour of England and Scotland===\n\nChopin's public popularity as a virtuoso began to wane, as did the number of his pupils, and this, together with the political strife and instability of the time, caused him to struggle financially.<ref name=\"Chen 34\"/> In February 1848, with the cellist [[Auguste Franchomme]], he gave his last Paris concert, which included three movements of the [[Cello Sonata (Chopin)|Cello Sonata Op. 65]].<ref name=\"gredxn\"/><ref name=\"Chen 34\"/>\n\n[[File:Jane stirling par deveria.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|[[Jane Stirling]], by [[Achille Dev\u00e9ria|Dev\u00e9ria]], c. 1830]]\nIn April, during the [[French Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]] in Paris, he left for London, where he performed at several concerts and numerous receptions in great houses.<ref name=\"gredxn\"/> This tour was suggested to him by his Scottish pupil [[Jane Stirling]] and her elder sister. Stirling also made all the logistical arrangements and provided much of the necessary funding.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a75, para. 3.</ref>\n\nIn London, Chopin took lodgings at [[Dover Street]], where the firm of Broadwood provided him with a grand piano. At his first engagement, on 15 May at [[Stafford House]], the audience included [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. The Prince, who was himself a talented musician, moved close to the keyboard to view Chopin's technique. Broadwood also arranged concerts for him; among those attending were [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]] and the singer [[Jenny Lind]]. Chopin was also sought after for piano lessons, for which he charged the high fee of one [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]] per hour, and for private recitals for which the fee was 20 guineas. At a concert on 7 July, he shared the platform with Viardot, who sang arrangements of some of his mazurkas to Spanish texts.<ref>Za\u0142uski (1992), pp. 227\u201329.</ref> On 28 August, he played at a concert in Manchester's Concert Hall, sharing the stage with [[Marietta Alboni]] and [[Lorenzo Salvi]].<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/09/from-the-classical-archive-chopin-alboni-review-manchester-1848 \"Review: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and Marietta Alboni perform in Manchester\"], ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'', 30 August 1848; also singing was Amalia Colbari; the conductor was Charles Seymour, who was later the first violinist in [[The Hall\u00e9]] orchestra.

He wrote at this time to Grzyma\u0142a \"My Scottish ladies are kind, but such bores\", and responding to a rumour about his involvement, answered that he was \"closer to the grave than the nuptial bed.\"<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 279 (loc. 4385).

By this time he was very seriously ill, weighing under 99 pounds (i.e. less than 45&nbsp;kg), and his doctors were aware that his sickness was at a terminal stage.<ref name=\"Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a75, para. 4\">Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a75, para. 4.</ref>\n\nAt the end of November, Chopin returned to Paris. He passed the winter in unremitting illness, but gave occasional lessons and was visited by friends, including Delacroix and Franchomme. Occasionally he played, or accompanied the singing of [[Delfina Potocka]], for his friends. During the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in [[Chaillot]], out of the centre of the city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, Princess Obreskoff. Here in June 1849, he was visited by [[Jenny Lind]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp. 283\u201386 (locs. 4446\u20134487).</ref>\n\n===Death and funeral===\n{{main|Health of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin}}\n[[File:Ostatnie chwile Fryderyka Chopina.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|left|''Chopin on His Deathbed'', by [[Teofil Kwiatkowski]], 1849, commissioned by [[Jane Stirling]].

All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either [[piano concerto]]s, songs or [[chamber music]].<ref>Hedley (1980), p. 298.</ref>\n\nChopin was educated in the tradition of Beethoven, [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], Mozart and [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]]; he used Clementi's piano method with his own students. He was also influenced by [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]]'s development of virtuoso, yet Mozartian, piano technique. He cited [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and Mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a76 para 7.</ref> Chopin's early works are in the style of the \"brilliant\" keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of [[Ignaz Moscheles]], [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]], and others. Less direct in the earlier period are the influences of Polish folk music and of [[Italian opera]]. Much of what became his typical style of ornamentation (for example, his ''[[fioritura|fioriture]]'') is taken from singing. His melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the [[mode (music)|modes]] and features of the music of his native country, such as [[drone (music)|drones]].<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.). \u00a76, paras 1\u20134.</ref>\n\nChopin took the new salon genre of the [[nocturne]], invented by the Irish composer [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], to a deeper level of sophistication. He was the first to write [[ballade (classical music)|ballades]]<ref name=\"scholesballade\"/> and [[Scherzo|scherzi]] as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op.&nbsp;28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert [[\u00e9tude]], already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi, and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op.&nbsp;10 published in 1833, Op.&nbsp;25 in 1837).<ref>Ferguson (1980), pp. 304\u201305.</ref>\n\nChopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and expression. [[Mazurkas (Chopin)|Chopin's mazurkas]], while originating in the traditional Polish dance (the ''[[mazurka|mazurek]]''), differed from the traditional variety in that they were written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall; as J. Barrie Jones puts it, \"it was Chopin who put the mazurka on the European musical map.\"<ref>Jones (1998b), p. 177.</ref> The series of seven [[Polonaises (Chopin)|polonaises]] published in his lifetime (another nine were published posthumously), beginning with the Op.&nbsp;26 pair (published 1836), set a new standard for music in the form.<ref name=\"chopin13\"/> His [[Waltzes (Chopin)|waltzes]] were also written specifically for the salon recital rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their dance-floor equivalents.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a p 162\">Jones (1998a), p. 162.</ref>\n\n===Titles, opus numbers and editions===\nSome of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the [[\u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 12 (Chopin)|''Revolutionary'' \u00c9tude]] (Op.&nbsp;10,&nbsp;No.&nbsp;12), and the ''[[Minute Waltz]]'' (Op.&nbsp;64,&nbsp;No.&nbsp;1). However, except for his ''Funeral March'', the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others.<ref>Hedley (2005), p. 264; Kennedy (1980), p. 130, ''Chopin, Fryderyk''.</ref> There is no evidence to suggest that the ''Revolutionary'' \u00c9tude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time.<ref>Hedley and Brown (1980), p. 294.</ref> The ''Funeral March'', the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op.&nbsp;35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.<ref>Kallberg (2001), pp. 4\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe last [[opus number]] that Chopin himself used was 65, allocated to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At the request of the composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66\u201373), published in 1855.<ref name=\"Piano Society\"/> In 1857, [[Polish songs (Chopin)|17 Polish songs]] that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.<ref name=\"Classical Archives\"/>\n\nWorks published since 1857 have received alternative catalogue designations instead of opus numbers. The present standard musicological reference for Chopin's works is the Kobyla\u0144ska Catalogue (usually represented by the initials 'KK'), named for its compiler, the Polish musicologist [[Krystyna Kobyla\u0144ska]].<ref>[http://chopin.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/what-does-the-kk-mean/ \"What does the \"KK\" Mean?\"], The Chopin Project Website, accessed 21 December 2013.</ref>\n\nChopin's original publishers included Maurice Schlesinger and Camille Pleyel.<ref>Atwood (1999), pp.&nbsp;166\u201367.</ref> His works soon began to appear in popular 19th-century piano anthologies.<ref>de Val (1998), p. 127.</ref> The first collected edition was by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] (1878\u20131902).<ref>de Val (1998), p. 129.</ref> Among modern scholarly editions of Chopin's works are the version under the name of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] published between 1937 and 1966 and the more recent Polish \"National Edition\", edited by [[Jan Ekier]], both of which contain detailed explanations and discussions regarding choices and sources.<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 306.</ref><ref>Jan Ekier, \"[http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/institutions/text/cat/1/page/2/id/1527 Foundation for the National Edition of the Works of Fryderyk Chopin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809202325/http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/institutions/text/cat/1/page/2/id/1527 |date=9 August 2014 }}\" on the website of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, (accessed 4 August 2014).</ref>\n\nChopin published his music in France, England and the German states due to the copyright laws of the time. As such there are often three different kinds of \u2018first editions\u2019. Each edition is different from the other, as Chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets, and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Background|url=http://www.chopinonline.ac.uk/cfeo/contexts/historical-background/|website=Chopin's First Editions Online|accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Form and harmony===\n[[File:Chopin Museum in Warsaw 03.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Chopin's last ([[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]]) piano, on which he composed in 1848\u201349.

Barrie Jones suggests that \"amongst the works that Chopin intended for concert use, the four ballades and four scherzos stand supreme\", and adds that \"the [[Barcarole (Chopin)|Barcarolle]] Op.&nbsp;60 stands apart as an example of Chopin's rich harmonic palette coupled with an Italianate warmth of melody.\"<ref>Jones (1998a), pp.&nbsp;161\u201362.</ref> Temperley opines that these works, which contain \"immense variety of mood, thematic material and structural detail\", are based on an extended \"departure and return\" form; \"the more the middle section is extended, and the further it departs in key, mood and theme, from the opening idea, the more important and dramatic is the reprise when it at last comes.\"<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 304.</ref>\n{{Listen|type=music|pos=left|filename=Giorgi Latsabidze Plays Mazurka.ogg|title=Mazurka in A minor, Op. 17, No. 4|description=[[Giorgi Latso]], piano|filename2=Muriel-Nguyen-Xuan-Chopin-valse-opus64-1.ogg\n|title2=Waltz in D-flat major, Op. 64, No. 1 (so-called ''Minute Waltz'')|description2=Muriel Nguyen Xuan, piano|filename3=Frederic Chopin - Opus 10 - Twelve Grand Etudes - c minor.ogg|title3 = \u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 12 (so-called ''Revolutionary'')|description3 = [[Martha Goldstein]] playing an 1851 [[S\u00e9bastien \u00c9rard|\u00c9rard]] piano|filename4=Chopin Prelude Op 28 N 15 Giorgi Latsabidze performs.ogg|title4=Prelude Op. 28, No. 15 in D-flat major|description4=[[Giorgi Latso]], piano}}\nChopin's mazurkas and waltzes are all in straightforward [[ternary form|ternary]] or episodic form, sometimes with a [[coda (music)|coda]].<ref>Jones (1998b), p. 177; Temperley (1980), p. 304.</ref> The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies and the use of drone basses. However, some also show unusual sophistication, for example Op.&nbsp;63 No.&nbsp;3, which includes a [[canon (music)|canon]] at one beat's distance, a great rarity in music.<ref>Jones (1998b), pp.&nbsp;177\u201379.</ref>\n\nChopin's polonaises show a marked advance on those of his Polish predecessors in the form (who included his teachers \u017bywny and Elsner). As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments, and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.<ref>Reiss (1980), p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe 21 [[Nocturnes (Chopin)|nocturnes]] are more structured, and of greater emotional depth, than those of Field (whom Chopin met in 1833). Many of the Chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression (and often making very difficult demands on the performer) which heightens their dramatic character.<ref>Brown (1980), p. 258.</ref>\n\nChopin's \u00e9tudes are largely in straightforward ternary form.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a, p. 160\">Jones (1998a), p. 160.</ref> He used them to teach his own technique of piano playing<ref name=\"rjsfih\"/>\u2014for instance playing double [[third (chord)|thirds]] ([[\u00c9tude Op. 25, No. 6 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;25, No.&nbsp;6]]), playing in octaves ([[\u00c9tude Op. 25, No. 10 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;25, No.&nbsp;10]]), and playing repeated notes ([[\u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 7 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;10, No.&nbsp; 7]]).<ref>Jones (1998a), pp.&nbsp;160\u201361.</ref>\n\nThe preludes, many of which are very brief (some consisting of simple statements and developments of a single theme or figure), were described by Schumann as \"the beginnings of studies\".<ref>Jones (1998a), p. 161.</ref> Inspired by J.S. Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', Chopin's preludes move up the [[circle of fifths]] (rather than Bach's [[chromatic scale]] sequence) to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality.<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 83.</ref> The preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group, and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic preludes to others of his pieces, or even to music by other composers, as [[Kenneth Hamilton]] suggests: he has noted a recording by [[Ferruccio Busoni]] of 1922, in which the Prelude Op.&nbsp;28 No.&nbsp;7 is followed by the \u00c9tude Op.&nbsp;10 No.&nbsp;5.<ref>Hamilton (2008), pp.&nbsp;101\u201302.</ref>\n\nThe two mature piano sonatas ([[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|No.&nbsp;2]], Op.&nbsp;35, written in 1839 and No.&nbsp;3, Op.&nbsp;58, written in 1844) are in four movements. In Op.&nbsp;35, Chopin was able to combine within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique\u2014\"a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the German sonata principle\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a79 para. 2.</ref> The sonata has been considered as showing the influences of both Bach and Beethoven. The Prelude from Bach's [[Cello Suites (Bach)#Suite No. 6 in D major, BWV 1012|Suite No. 6 in D major for cello]] (BWV 1012) is quoted;<ref>Lekin (1994), pp. 191\u201392</ref> and there are references to two sonatas of Beethoven: the [[Piano Sonata No. 32 (Beethoven)|Sonata Opus 111]] in C minor, and the [[Piano Sonata No. 12 (Beethoven)|Sonata Opus 26]] in A flat major,  which, like Chopin's Op. 35, has a [[funeral march]] as its slow movement.<ref>Leikin (1994), p. 177.</ref><ref>Petty (1999), p. 289.</ref> The last movement of Chopin's Op. 35, a brief (75-bar) [[perpetuum mobile]] in which the hands play in unmodified octave unison throughout, was found shocking and unmusical by contemporaries, including Schumann.<ref>Rosen (1995), pp.&nbsp;294\u201397.</ref> The Op.&nbsp;58 sonata is closer to the German tradition, including many passages of complex [[counterpoint]], \"worthy of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]\" according to the music historians Kornel Micha\u0142owski and Jim Samson.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/>\n\nChopin's harmonic innovations may have arisen partly from his keyboard improvisation technique. Temperley says that in his works \"novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary [[appoggiatura]]s or [[passing notes]] with melodic figures of accompaniment\", and [[cadence (music)|cadences]] are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key ([[neapolitan sixth]]s and [[diminished seventh]]s), or by sudden shifts to remote keys. [[Chord progression]]s sometimes anticipate the shifting [[tonality]] of later composers such as [[Claude Debussy]], as does Chopin's use of modal harmony.<ref>Temperley (1980), pp.&nbsp;302\u201303.</ref>\n\n===Technique and performance style===\n[[File:Op 62-1ms.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Extract from Chopin Nocturne Op. 62 no. 1 (1846, composer's manuscript)]]\n[[File:Chopin op 62-1 pr.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|The same passage (1881 [[G.

The examples show typical use by Chopin of [[trill (music)|trills]], [[grace note]]s and detailed [[pedal (piano)|pedalling]] and [[tempo]] instructions.]]\nIn 1841, [[L\u00e9on Escudier]] wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, \"One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\"<ref>Samson (1994), p. 136.</ref> Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of a very independent finger technique. In his ''Projet de m\u00e9thode'' he wrote: \"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering&nbsp;... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\"<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 18.</ref> He further stated: \"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\"<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 23.</ref> The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double [[octave]]s and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of [[grace notes]], and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.<ref>Eigeldinger (1988), pp.&nbsp;18\u201320.</ref>\n\n[[Jonathan Bellman]] writes that modern concert performance style\u2014set in the \"[[music school|conservatory]]\" tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings\u2014militates against what is known of Chopin's more intimate performance technique.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 149\u201350.</ref> The composer himself said to a pupil that \"concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art.\"<ref>Cited in Bellman (2000), p. 150; the pupil was Emilie von Gretsch.</ref> Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as \"always crescendo to a high note\", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 153\u201354.</ref>  Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin \"has created a kind of chromatic embroidery&nbsp;... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe&nbsp;... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn\".<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 272.</ref> Hiller wrote that \"What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers.\"<ref>Cited in Bellman (2000), p. 154.</ref>\n\nChopin's music is frequently played with ''[[Tempo rubato|rubato]]'', \"the practice in performance of disregarding strict time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect\".<ref>Latham (n.d.).</ref> There are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of ''rubato'' is appropriate for his works. [[Charles Rosen]] comments that \"most of the written-out indications of rubato in Chopin are to be found in his mazurkas&nbsp;... It is probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart&nbsp;... [where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass&nbsp;... An allied form of this rubato is the [[arpeggio|arpeggiation]] of the chords thereby delaying the melody note; according to Chopin's pupil [[Karol Mikuli]], Chopin was firmly opposed to this practice.\"<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 413.</ref>\n\nFriederike M\u00fcller, a pupil of Chopin, wrote: \"[His] playing was always noble and beautiful; his tones sang, whether in full ''[[forte (dynamic)|forte]]'' or softest ''[[Dynamics (music)|piano]]''. He took infinite pains to teach his pupils this ''[[legato]]'', ''[[cantabile]]'' style of playing. His most severe criticism was 'He\u2014or she\u2014does not know how to join two notes together.' He also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm. He hated all lingering and dragging, misplaced ''rubatos'', as well as exaggerated ''[[Tempo|ritardandos]]''&nbsp;... and it is precisely in this respect that people make such terrible errors in playing his works.\"<ref name=\"nifc14\"/>\n\n===Polish heritage===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:0; margin-right:0; margin:10px; background:khaki; color:black; width:40em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\nThe \"Polish character\" of Chopin's work is unquestionable; not because he also wrote polonaises and mazurkas&nbsp;... which forms&nbsp;... were often stuffed with alien ideological and literary contents from the outside.&nbsp;...

For he understood that he could invest his music with the most enduring and truly Polish qualities only by liberating art from the confines of dramatic and historical contents. This attitude toward the question of \"national music\"&nbsp;\u2013 an inspired solution to his art&nbsp;\u2013 was the reason why Chopin's works have come to be understood everywhere outside of Poland&nbsp;...

Schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted the composer's strong feelings for his native Poland, writing that \"Now that the Poles are in deep mourning [after the failure of the [[November Uprising]] of 1830], their appeal to us artists is even stronger&nbsp;... If the mighty autocrat in the north [i.e. [[Nicholas I of Russia]]] could know that in Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music. Chopin's works are cannon buried in flowers!\"<ref>Schumann (1988), p. 114.</ref> The biography of Chopin published in 1863 under the name of Franz Liszt (but probably written by [[Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein]])<ref>Cooke (1966), pp. 856\u201361.</ref> states that Chopin \"must be ranked first among the first musicians&nbsp;... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation.\"<ref>Liszt (1880), loc. 1503.</ref>\n\nSome modern commentators have argued against exaggerating Chopin's primacy as a \"nationalist\" or \"patriotic\" composer. George Golos refers to earlier \"nationalist\" composers in Central Europe, including Poland's [[Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski]] and [[Franciszek Lessel]], who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms.<ref>Golos (1960), pp. 439\u201342.</ref> Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin's experience of Polish music came more from \"urbanised\" Warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts (by Jachimecki and others) to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis.<ref>Milewski (1999), pp. 113\u201321.</ref> [[Richard Taruskin]] impugns Schumann's attitude toward Chopin's works as patronising<ref>Taruskin (2010), pp. 344\u201345.</ref> and comments that Chopin \"felt his Polish patriotism deeply and sincerely\" but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, and Field.<ref>Taruskin (2010), p. 346; see also Rosen (1995), pp. 361\u201363.</ref>\n\nA reconciliation of these views is suggested by William Atwood: \"Undoubtedly [Chopin's] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those Poles scattered across Europe and the New World&nbsp;... While some sought solace in [them], others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom. Although Chopin's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to symbolize the will of the Polish people&nbsp;...\"<ref>Atwood (1999), p. 57.</ref>\n\n===Reception and influence===\n{{See also|List of memorials to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin}}\n[[File:Pillar containing Chopin's heart.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Funerary monument on a pillar in [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw]], enclosing Chopin's heart]]\nJones comments that \"Chopin's unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been questioned.\"<ref name=\"Jones 1998a, p. 160\"/> He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831\u2014\"the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons\"\u2014and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a p 162\"/> While his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of [[romanticism]], the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soir\u00e9es) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that \"his lack of [[Lord Byron|Byronic]] flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional\" among his romantic contemporaries, such as Liszt and Henri Herz.<ref name=\"Hutchings 1968, p. 137\"/>\n\nChopin's qualities as a pianist and composer were recognised by many of his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', and Chopin later dedicated his [[Ballade No. 2 (Chopin)|Ballade No. 2 in F major]] to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works.<ref name=\"Walker 1988 184\"/> Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by Chopin's death.<ref>Conway (2012), pp. 229\u201330.</ref>\n\nTwo of Chopin's long-standing pupils, Karol Mikuli (1821\u20131897) and Georges Mathias, were themselves piano teachers and passed on details of his playing to their own students, some of whom (such as [[Raoul Koczalski]]) were to make recordings of his music. Other pianists and composers influenced by Chopin's style include [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]], \u00c9douard Wolff (1816\u20131880) and Pierre Zimmermann.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 150\u201351.</ref> Debussy dedicated [[\u00c9tudes (Debussy)|his own 1915 piano \u00c9tudes]] to the memory of Chopin; he frequently played Chopin's music during his studies at the [[Paris Conservatoire]], and undertook the editing of Chopin's piano music for the publisher [[Jacques Durand (publisher)|Jacques Durand]].<ref>Wheeldon (2009), {{pp.|55|62}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pomnik Fryderyka Chopina w \u0141azienkach (1 of 1).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin Monument in Warsaw|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin Monument]], [[\u0141azienki Park]], Warsaw]]\nPolish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as [[Moritz Moszkowski]], but, in the opinion of J.

He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era, one whose \"poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation.\"<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 284.</ref>\n\nChopin was born '''Aramo Dirmesropian''' in the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and grew up in [[Warsaw]], which in 1815 became part of [[Congress Poland]]. A [[child prodigy]], he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]]. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter\u2014in the last 18 years of his life\u2014he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]. He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with [[Franz Liszt]] and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries (including [[Robert Schumann]]). \n\nAfter a failed engagement to [[Maria Wodzi\u0144ska]] from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin (known by her pen name, [[George Sand]]). A brief and unhappy visit to [[Majorca]] with Sand in 1838\u201339 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer [[Jane Stirling]], who also arranged for him to visit [[Scotland]] in 1848. For most of his life, Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39, probably of [[pericarditis]] aggravated by [[tuberculosis]].\n\nAll of Chopin's compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two [[piano concerto]]s, a few [[chamber music|chamber pieces]], and some 19 [[Polish songs (Chopin)|songs set to Polish lyrics]]. His piano writing was technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument: his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of the [[ballade (classical music)#Instrumental ballades|instrumental ''ballade'']]. His major piano works also include [[mazurka]]s, [[waltz]]es, [[nocturne]]s, [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]]s, [[\u00e9tude]]s, [[impromptu]]s, [[scherzo]]s, [[prelude (music)|preludes]] and [[sonata]]s, some published only posthumously. Among the influences on his style of composition were Polish [[folk music]], the [[classical music|classical tradition]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Beethoven, Giachono Rossini]] and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and the atmosphere of the Paris salons of which he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, [[harmony]], and [[musical form]], and his association of music with [[nationalism]], were influential throughout and after the late [[romanticism|Romantic]] period.\n\nChopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest superstars, his (indirect) association with political insurrection, his high-profile love-life, and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of [[#In literature, stage, film and television|numerous films and biographies]] of varying historical fidelity.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Manor house in \u017belazowa Wola.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Chopin's birthplace in [[\u017belazowa Wola]]]]\n\nFryderyk Chopin was born in [[\u017belazowa Wola]],<ref name=\"Zamoyski (2010), pp. 4\u20135 \">Zamoyski (2010), pp. 4\u20135 (locs. 115\u2013130).</ref> 46 kilometres ({{convert|46|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) west of Warsaw, in what was then the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a Polish state established by [[Napoleon]].

Fryderyk and his family moved to a building, which still survives, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace. During this period, Fryderyk was sometimes invited to the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]] as playmate to the son of the ruler of [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]], [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia]]; he played the piano for Constantine Pavlovich and composed a march for him. [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]], in his dramatic [[eclogue]], \"''Nasze Przebiegi''\" (\"Our Discourses\", 1818), attested to \"little Chopin's\" popularity.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp. 11\u201312 (locs. 231\u2013248).</ref>\n\n===Education===\nFrom September 1823 to 1826, Chopin attended the Warsaw Lyceum, where he received [[organ (music)|organ]] lessons from the [[Czechs|Czech]] musician [[Wilhelm W\u00fcrfel]] during his first year. In the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the [[Silesia]]n composer [[J\u00f3zef Elsner]] at the [[Fryderyk Chopin University of Music|Warsaw Conservatory]], studying [[music theory]], [[figured bass]], and [[musical composition|composition]].<ref name=\"Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a71, para. 5\">Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a71, para. 5.</ref>{{refn|The Conservatory was affiliated with the [[University of Warsaw]]; hence Chopin is counted among the [[University of Warsaw#Notable alumni|university's alumni]].|group=n}} Throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw. He was engaged by the inventors of the \"aeolomelodicon\" (a combination of piano and mechanical organ), and on this instrument, in May 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by [[Ignaz Moscheles|Moscheles]]. The success of this concert led to an invitation to give a recital on a similar instrument (the \"aeolopantaleon\") before [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]], who was visiting Warsaw; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring. At a subsequent aeolopantaleon concert on 10 June 1825, Chopin performed his [[Rondo in C minor (Chopin)|Rondo Op. 1]]. This was the first of his works to be commercially published and earned him his first mention in the foreign press, when the Leipzig ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung|Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung]]'' praised his \"wealth of musical ideas\".<ref>Walker (2018), pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n[[File:J\u00f3zef Elsner.PNG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[J\u00f3zef Elsner]] (after 1853)]]\nDuring 1824\u201328 Chopin spent his vacations away from Warsaw, at a number of locales.{{refn|At [[Szafarnia, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Szafarnia]] (in 1824&nbsp;\u2013 perhaps his first solo travel away from home&nbsp;\u2013 and in 1825), [[Duszniki-Zdr\u00f3j|Duszniki]] (1826), [[Pomerania]] (1827) and [[Sanniki, Masovian Voivodeship|Sanniki]] (1828).<ref>Szklener (2010), p. 8.</ref>|group=n}} In 1824 and 1825, at [[Szafarnia, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Szafarnia]], he was a guest of [[Dominik Dziewanowski]], the father of a schoolmate.

The musicologist [[Arthur Hedley]] has observed that \"As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances\u2014few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime.\"<ref>Hedley (2005), pp. 263\u201364.</ref> The list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts indicates the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period. Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt, and Hiller performed (on pianos) a [[Harpsichord concertos (J. S. Bach)#Concertos for three harpsichords|concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards]]; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil [[Adolphe Gutmann]], [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], and Alkan's teacher [[Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmermann|Joseph Zimmermann]] performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|7th symphony]].<ref>Conway (2012), p. 226 and n. 9.</ref> Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's ''[[Hexameron (musical composition)|Hexameron]]''; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s theme. Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with [[Maurice Schlesinger]], who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d), \u00a72, para. 5. For Schlesinger's international network see Conway (2012), pp. 185\u201387, 238\u201339.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in [[Aachen|Aix-la-Chapelle]] with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]], director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as [[Karl Friedrich Lessing|Lessing]], [[Eduard Bendemann|Bendemann]], [[Eduard Hildebrandt|Hildebrandt]] and [[Karl Ferdinand Sohn|Sohn]].<ref>Niecks (1980), p. 313.</ref> In 1835 Chopin went to [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]], where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter [[Maria Wodzi\u0144ska|Maria]] in Poland five years earlier when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via [[Leipzig]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;118\u201319 (locs. 1861\u20131878).</ref> The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses.<ref name=\"demonstrated\"/> In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, [[Clara Schumann|Clara Wieck]] and Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio ''[[St. Paul (oratorio)|St. Paul]]'', and who considered him \"a perfect musician\".<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;119\u201320 (locs. 1878\u20131896).</ref> In July 1836 Chopin travelled to [[Marienbad]] and [[Dresden]] to be with the Wodzi\u0144ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approved in principle.

You would not believe how curious I was about [[Henri Herz|Herz]], Liszt, Hiller, etc.\"<ref>Hall-Swadley (2011), p. 31.</ref> Liszt was in attendance at Chopin's Parisian debut on 26 February 1832 at the Salle Pleyel, which led him to remark: \"The most vigorous applause seemed not to suffice to our enthusiasm in the presence of this talented musician, who revealed a new phase of poetic sentiment combined with such happy innovation in the form of his art.\"<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/>\n\nThe two became friends, and for many years lived close to each other in Paris, Chopin at 38 [[Rue de la Chauss\u00e9e-d'Antin]], and Liszt at the H\u00f4tel de France on the Rue Lafitte, a few blocks away.<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\"/> They performed together on seven occasions between 1833 and 1841. The first, on 2 April 1833, was at a benefit concert organised by Hector Berlioz for his bankrupt Shakespearean actress wife [[Harriet Smithson]], during which they played [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]]'s ''Sonata in F minor'' for piano duet.<ref name=\"Hall 32\">Hall-Swadley (2011), p. 32.</ref> Later joint appearances included a benefit concert for the Benevolent Association of Polish Ladies in Paris.<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/> Their last appearance together in public was for a charity concert conducted for the [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn, held at the Salle Pleyel and the Paris Conservatory on 25 and 26 April 1841.<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/>\n\nAlthough the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship. [[Harold C. Schonberg]] believes that Chopin displayed a \"tinge of jealousy and spite\" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano,<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\">Schonberg (1987), p. 151.</ref> and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success.<ref>Hall-Swadley (2011), p. 33.</ref>  Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 \u00c9tudes, and his performance of them  prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\"<ref name=\"Walker 1988 184\">Walker (1988), p. 184.</ref> However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\".<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\"/> Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress [[Marie d'Agoult]]'s obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with [[George Sand]].<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/>\n\n===George Sand===\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 043.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Chopin at 28, from [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s [[Portrait of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and George Sand|joint portrait of Chopin and Sand]], 1838]]\nIn 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\"/> Short (under five feet, or 152&nbsp;cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker,<ref>Schonberg (1987), p. 152.</ref> she initially repelled Chopin, who remarked, \"What an unattractive person ''la Sand'' is.

All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either [[piano concerto]]s, songs or [[chamber music]].<ref>Hedley (1980), p. 298.</ref>\n\nChopin was educated in the tradition of Beethoven, [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], Mozart and [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]]; he used Clementi's piano method with his own students. He was also influenced by [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]]'s development of virtuoso, yet Mozartian, piano technique. He cited [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and Mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a76 para 7.</ref> Chopin's early works are in the style of the \"brilliant\" keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of [[Ignaz Moscheles]], [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]], and others. Less direct in the earlier period are the influences of Polish folk music and of [[Italian opera]]. Much of what became his typical style of ornamentation (for example, his ''[[fioritura|fioriture]]'') is taken from singing. His melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the [[mode (music)|modes]] and features of the music of his native country, such as [[drone (music)|drones]].<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.). \u00a76, paras 1\u20134.</ref>\n\nChopin took the new salon genre of the [[nocturne]], invented by the Irish composer [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], to a deeper level of sophistication. He was the first to write [[ballade (classical music)|ballades]]<ref name=\"scholesballade\"/> and [[Scherzo|scherzi]] as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op.&nbsp;28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert [[\u00e9tude]], already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi, and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op.&nbsp;10 published in 1833, Op.&nbsp;25 in 1837).<ref>Ferguson (1980), pp. 304\u201305.</ref>\n\nChopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and expression. [[Mazurkas (Chopin)|Chopin's mazurkas]], while originating in the traditional Polish dance (the ''[[mazurka|mazurek]]''), differed from the traditional variety in that they were written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall; as J. Barrie Jones puts it, \"it was Chopin who put the mazurka on the European musical map.\"<ref>Jones (1998b), p. 177.</ref> The series of seven [[Polonaises (Chopin)|polonaises]] published in his lifetime (another nine were published posthumously), beginning with the Op.&nbsp;26 pair (published 1836), set a new standard for music in the form.<ref name=\"chopin13\"/> His [[Waltzes (Chopin)|waltzes]] were also written specifically for the salon recital rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their dance-floor equivalents.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a p 162\">Jones (1998a), p. 162.</ref>\n\n===Titles, opus numbers and editions===\nSome of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the [[\u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 12 (Chopin)|''Revolutionary'' \u00c9tude]] (Op.&nbsp;10,&nbsp;No.&nbsp;12), and the ''[[Minute Waltz]]'' (Op.&nbsp;64,&nbsp;No.&nbsp;1). However, except for his ''Funeral March'', the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others.<ref>Hedley (2005), p. 264; Kennedy (1980), p. 130, ''Chopin, Fryderyk''.</ref> There is no evidence to suggest that the ''Revolutionary'' \u00c9tude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time.<ref>Hedley and Brown (1980), p. 294.</ref> The ''Funeral March'', the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op.&nbsp;35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.<ref>Kallberg (2001), pp. 4\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe last [[opus number]] that Chopin himself used was 65, allocated to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At the request of the composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66\u201373), published in 1855.<ref name=\"Piano Society\"/> In 1857, [[Polish songs (Chopin)|17 Polish songs]] that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.<ref name=\"Classical Archives\"/>\n\nWorks published since 1857 have received alternative catalogue designations instead of opus numbers. The present standard musicological reference for Chopin's works is the Kobyla\u0144ska Catalogue (usually represented by the initials 'KK'), named for its compiler, the Polish musicologist [[Krystyna Kobyla\u0144ska]].<ref>[http://chopin.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/what-does-the-kk-mean/ \"What does the \"KK\" Mean?\"], The Chopin Project Website, accessed 21 December 2013.</ref>\n\nChopin's original publishers included Maurice Schlesinger and Camille Pleyel.<ref>Atwood (1999), pp.&nbsp;166\u201367.</ref> His works soon began to appear in popular 19th-century piano anthologies.<ref>de Val (1998), p. 127.</ref> The first collected edition was by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] (1878\u20131902).<ref>de Val (1998), p. 129.</ref> Among modern scholarly editions of Chopin's works are the version under the name of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] published between 1937 and 1966 and the more recent Polish \"National Edition\", edited by [[Jan Ekier]], both of which contain detailed explanations and discussions regarding choices and sources.<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 306.</ref><ref>Jan Ekier, \"[http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/institutions/text/cat/1/page/2/id/1527 Foundation for the National Edition of the Works of Fryderyk Chopin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809202325/http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/institutions/text/cat/1/page/2/id/1527 |date=9 August 2014 }}\" on the website of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, (accessed 4 August 2014).</ref>\n\nChopin published his music in France, England and the German states due to the copyright laws of the time. As such there are often three different kinds of \u2018first editions\u2019. Each edition is different from the other, as Chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets, and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Background|url=http://www.chopinonline.ac.uk/cfeo/contexts/historical-background/|website=Chopin's First Editions Online|accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Form and harmony===\n[[File:Chopin Museum in Warsaw 03.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Chopin's last ([[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]]) piano, on which he composed in 1848\u201349.

Barrie Jones suggests that \"amongst the works that Chopin intended for concert use, the four ballades and four scherzos stand supreme\", and adds that \"the [[Barcarole (Chopin)|Barcarolle]] Op.&nbsp;60 stands apart as an example of Chopin's rich harmonic palette coupled with an Italianate warmth of melody.\"<ref>Jones (1998a), pp.&nbsp;161\u201362.</ref> Temperley opines that these works, which contain \"immense variety of mood, thematic material and structural detail\", are based on an extended \"departure and return\" form; \"the more the middle section is extended, and the further it departs in key, mood and theme, from the opening idea, the more important and dramatic is the reprise when it at last comes.\"<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 304.</ref>\n{{Listen|type=music|pos=left|filename=Giorgi Latsabidze Plays Mazurka.ogg|title=Mazurka in A minor, Op. 17, No. 4|description=[[Giorgi Latso]], piano|filename2=Muriel-Nguyen-Xuan-Chopin-valse-opus64-1.ogg\n|title2=Waltz in D-flat major, Op. 64, No. 1 (so-called ''Minute Waltz'')|description2=Muriel Nguyen Xuan, piano|filename3=Frederic Chopin - Opus 10 - Twelve Grand Etudes - c minor.ogg|title3 = \u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 12 (so-called ''Revolutionary'')|description3 = [[Martha Goldstein]] playing an 1851 [[S\u00e9bastien \u00c9rard|\u00c9rard]] piano|filename4=Chopin Prelude Op 28 N 15 Giorgi Latsabidze performs.ogg|title4=Prelude Op. 28, No. 15 in D-flat major|description4=[[Giorgi Latso]], piano}}\nChopin's mazurkas and waltzes are all in straightforward [[ternary form|ternary]] or episodic form, sometimes with a [[coda (music)|coda]].<ref>Jones (1998b), p. 177; Temperley (1980), p. 304.</ref> The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies and the use of drone basses.

As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments, and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.<ref>Reiss (1980), p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe 21 [[Nocturnes (Chopin)|nocturnes]] are more structured, and of greater emotional depth, than those of Field (whom Chopin met in 1833). Many of the Chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression (and often making very difficult demands on the performer) which heightens their dramatic character.<ref>Brown (1980), p. 258.</ref>\n\nChopin's \u00e9tudes are largely in straightforward ternary form.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a, p. 160\">Jones (1998a), p. 160.</ref> He used them to teach his own technique of piano playing<ref name=\"rjsfih\"/>\u2014for instance playing double [[third (chord)|thirds]] ([[\u00c9tude Op. 25, No. 6 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;25, No.&nbsp;6]]), playing in octaves ([[\u00c9tude Op. 25, No. 10 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;25, No.&nbsp;10]]), and playing repeated notes ([[\u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 7 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;10, No.&nbsp; 7]]).<ref>Jones (1998a), pp.&nbsp;160\u201361.</ref>\n\nThe preludes, many of which are very brief (some consisting of simple statements and developments of a single theme or figure), were described by Schumann as \"the beginnings of studies\".<ref>Jones (1998a), p. 161.</ref> Inspired by J.S. Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', Chopin's preludes move up the [[circle of fifths]] (rather than Bach's [[chromatic scale]] sequence) to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality.<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 83.</ref> The preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group, and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic preludes to others of his pieces, or even to music by other composers, as [[Kenneth Hamilton]] suggests: he has noted a recording by [[Ferruccio Busoni]] of 1922, in which the Prelude Op.&nbsp;28 No.&nbsp;7 is followed by the \u00c9tude Op.&nbsp;10 No.&nbsp;5.<ref>Hamilton (2008), pp.&nbsp;101\u201302.</ref>\n\nThe two mature piano sonatas ([[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|No.&nbsp;2]], Op.&nbsp;35, written in 1839 and No.&nbsp;3, Op.&nbsp;58, written in 1844) are in four movements. In Op.&nbsp;35, Chopin was able to combine within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique\u2014\"a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the German sonata principle\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a79 para. 2.</ref> The sonata has been considered as showing the influences of both Bach and Beethoven.

Temperley says that in his works \"novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary [[appoggiatura]]s or [[passing notes]] with melodic figures of accompaniment\", and [[cadence (music)|cadences]] are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key ([[neapolitan sixth]]s and [[diminished seventh]]s), or by sudden shifts to remote keys.

The examples show typical use by Chopin of [[trill (music)|trills]], [[grace note]]s and detailed [[pedal (piano)|pedalling]] and [[tempo]] instructions.]]\nIn 1841, [[L\u00e9on Escudier]] wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, \"One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\"<ref>Samson (1994), p. 136.</ref> Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of a very independent finger technique. In his ''Projet de m\u00e9thode'' he wrote: \"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering&nbsp;... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\"<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 18.</ref> He further stated: \"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\"<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 23.</ref> The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double [[octave]]s and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of [[grace notes]], and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.<ref>Eigeldinger (1988), pp.&nbsp;18\u201320.</ref>\n\n[[Jonathan Bellman]] writes that modern concert performance style\u2014set in the \"[[music school|conservatory]]\" tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings\u2014militates against what is known of Chopin's more intimate performance technique.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 149\u201350.</ref> The composer himself said to a pupil that \"concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art.\"<ref>Cited in Bellman (2000), p. 150; the pupil was Emilie von Gretsch.</ref> Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as \"always crescendo to a high note\", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 153\u201354.</ref>  Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin \"has created a kind of chromatic embroidery&nbsp;... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe&nbsp;... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn\".<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 272.</ref> Hiller wrote that \"What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers.\"<ref>Cited in Bellman (2000), p. 154.</ref>\n\nChopin's music is frequently played with ''[[Tempo rubato|rubato]]'', \"the practice in performance of disregarding strict time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect\".<ref>Latham (n.d.).</ref> There are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of ''rubato'' is appropriate for his works. [[Charles Rosen]] comments that \"most of the written-out indications of rubato in Chopin are to be found in his mazurkas&nbsp;... It is probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart&nbsp;... [where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass&nbsp;... An allied form of this rubato is the [[arpeggio|arpeggiation]] of the chords thereby delaying the melody note; according to Chopin's pupil [[Karol Mikuli]], Chopin was firmly opposed to this practice.\"<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 413.</ref>\n\nFriederike M\u00fcller, a pupil of Chopin, wrote: \"[His] playing was always noble and beautiful; his tones sang, whether in full ''[[forte (dynamic)|forte]]'' or softest ''[[Dynamics (music)|piano]]''. He took infinite pains to teach his pupils this ''[[legato]]'', ''[[cantabile]]'' style of playing. His most severe criticism was 'He\u2014or she\u2014does not know how to join two notes together.' He also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm. He hated all lingering and dragging, misplaced ''rubatos'', as well as exaggerated ''[[Tempo|ritardandos]]''&nbsp;... and it is precisely in this respect that people make such terrible errors in playing his works.\"<ref name=\"nifc14\"/>\n\n===Polish heritage===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:0; margin-right:0; margin:10px; background:khaki; color:black; width:40em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\nThe \"Polish character\" of Chopin's work is unquestionable; not because he also wrote polonaises and mazurkas&nbsp;... which forms&nbsp;... were often stuffed with alien ideological and literary contents from the outside.&nbsp;... As an artist he looked for forms that stood apart from the literary-dramatic character of music which was a feature of Romanticism, as a Pole he reflected in his work the very essence of the tragic break in the history of the people and instinctively aspired to give the deepest expression of his nation&nbsp;... For he understood that he could invest his music with the most enduring and truly Polish qualities only by liberating art from the confines of dramatic and historical contents. This attitude toward the question of \"national music\"&nbsp;\u2013 an inspired solution to his art&nbsp;\u2013 was the reason why Chopin's works have come to be understood everywhere outside of Poland&nbsp;... Therein lies the strange riddle of his eternal vigour.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 100%;\" |[[Karol Szymanowski]], 1923<ref>Cited from Szymanowski's 1923 essay, \"Fryderyk Chopin\", in Downes (2001), p. 63 and n. 58.</ref>\n|}With his mazurkas and polonaises, Chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of [[nationalism]]. Schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted the composer's strong feelings for his native Poland, writing that \"Now that the Poles are in deep mourning [after the failure of the [[November Uprising]] of 1830], their appeal to us artists is even stronger&nbsp;... If the mighty autocrat in the north [i.e. [[Nicholas I of Russia]]] could know that in Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music. Chopin's works are cannon buried in flowers!\"<ref>Schumann (1988), p. 114.</ref> The biography of Chopin published in 1863 under the name of Franz Liszt (but probably written by [[Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein]])<ref>Cooke (1966), pp. 856\u201361.</ref> states that Chopin \"must be ranked first among the first musicians&nbsp;... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation.\"<ref>Liszt (1880), loc. 1503.</ref>\n\nSome modern commentators have argued against exaggerating Chopin's primacy as a \"nationalist\" or \"patriotic\" composer. George Golos refers to earlier \"nationalist\" composers in Central Europe, including Poland's [[Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski]] and [[Franciszek Lessel]], who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms.<ref>Golos (1960), pp. 439\u201342.</ref> Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin's experience of Polish music came more from \"urbanised\" Warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts (by Jachimecki and others) to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis.<ref>Milewski (1999), pp. 113\u201321.</ref> [[Richard Taruskin]] impugns Schumann's attitude toward Chopin's works as patronising<ref>Taruskin (2010), pp. 344\u201345.</ref> and comments that Chopin \"felt his Polish patriotism deeply and sincerely\" but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, and Field.<ref>Taruskin (2010), p. 346; see also Rosen (1995), pp. 361\u201363.</ref>\n\nA reconciliation of these views is suggested by William Atwood: \"Undoubtedly [Chopin's] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those Poles scattered across Europe and the New World&nbsp;... While some sought solace in [them], others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom. Although Chopin's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to symbolize the will of the Polish people&nbsp;...\"<ref>Atwood (1999), p. 57.</ref>\n\n===Reception and influence===\n{{See also|List of memorials to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin}}\n[[File:Pillar containing Chopin's heart.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Funerary monument on a pillar in [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw]], enclosing Chopin's heart]]\nJones comments that \"Chopin's unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been questioned.\"<ref name=\"Jones 1998a, p. 160\"/> He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831\u2014\"the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons\"\u2014and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a p 162\"/> While his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of [[romanticism]], the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soir\u00e9es) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that \"his lack of [[Lord Byron|Byronic]] flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional\" among his romantic contemporaries, such as Liszt and Henri Herz.<ref name=\"Hutchings 1968, p. 137\"/>\n\nChopin's qualities as a pianist and composer were recognised by many of his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', and Chopin later dedicated his [[Ballade No. 2 (Chopin)|Ballade No. 2 in F major]] to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works.<ref name=\"Walker 1988 184\"/> Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs.

Jugurtha was the nephew and adopted son of [[Micipsa]], [[King of Numidia]], whom he succeeded on the throne, overcoming his rivals through assassination, war, and bribery.\n\nThe war constituted an important phase in the Roman subjugation of Northern Africa, but Numidia did not become a Roman province until 46 BC. Following Jugurtha's usurpation of the throne of Numidia,<ref>Sallust, ''The Jugurthine War'', XII</ref> a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars,<ref>Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 64</ref> Rome felt compelled to intervene.\n\n==Jugurtha and Numidia==\n\n[[Numidia]] was a kingdom located in [[North Africa]] (roughly corresponding to northern modern day [[Algeria]]) adjacent to what had been [[Roman Republic|Rome]]'s arch enemy, [[Carthage]]. King [[Masinissa]], who was a steadfast ally of Rome in the [[Third Punic War]], died in 149, and was succeeded by his son [[Micipsa]], who ruled 149-118 BC. At the time of his death Micipsa had three potential heirs, his two sons, [[Adherbal (king of Numidia)|Adherbal]] and [[Hiempsal I]], and an illegitimate nephew, [[Jugurtha]]. Jugurtha had fought under [[Scipio Aemilianus]] at the siege of Numantia, where, through friendship with Roman aristocrats, he had formed an acquaintance with Roman manners and military tactics. Micipsa, worried that at his death Jugurtha would usurp the kingdom from his own somewhat less able sons, adopted him, and bequeathed the kingship jointly to his two sons and Jugurtha.<ref>[[J. A. Froude]], ''Caesar- A Sketch'', ([[A. L. Burt]] Company, New York, 1903), ch. IV, pp. 33, 34</ref> After King Micipsa's death the three kings fell out, and ultimately agreed between themselves to divide their inheritance into three separate kingdoms;<ref>[[T. Mommsen]], ''The History of Rome'', (The Colonial Press, Massachusetts, 1958), ch. III, p. 94</ref> however, they were unable to agree on the terms of division, and Jugurtha declared open war on his cousins; Hiempsal, who, though the younger, was the braver of the brothers, was assassinated by Jugurtha's agents, and Adherbal, unable to defend himself, was defeated and forced to flee to Rome, where he appealed for arbitration to the [[Roman Senate]].<ref>Mommsen, p. 95</ref>\n\nAlthough the Senate were securities for Micipsa's will, they now allowed themselves to be bribed by Jugurtha into overlooking his crimes, and organized a commission, led by the ex-[[Consul]] [[Lucius Opimius]], to fairly divide Numidia between the remaining contestants (116 BC). However, Jugurtha bribed the Roman officials in the commission into allotting him the better, more fertile and populous western half of Numidia, while Adherbal received the east.<ref name=mom96>Mommsen, p. 96</ref> Powerless against Roman corruption, Adherbal accepted and peace was made. Shortly after, in 113 BC, Jugurtha again declared war on his brother, and defeated him, forcing him to retreat into [[Cirta]], Adherbal's capital.<ref name=mom96/> Adherbal held out for some months, aided by a large number of Roman Equites who had settled in Africa for commercial purposes. From inside his siege lines, Adherbal appealed again to Rome, and the Senate dispatched a message to Jugurtha to desist. The latter ignored the demand, and the Senate sent a second commission, this time headed by [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Scaurus]], a respected member of the aristocracy, to threaten the Numidian king into submission. The king, pretending to be open to discussion, protracted negotiations with Scaurus long enough for Cirta to run out of provisions and hope of relief. When Scaurus left without having forced Jugurtha to a commitment, Adherbal surrendered. Jugurtha promptly had him executed, along with the Romans who had joined in the defence of Cirta.<ref>Mommsen, p. 97</ref> But the deaths of Roman citizens caused an immediate furore among the commoners at home, and the Senate, threatened by the popular tribune [[Gaius Memmius (tribune)|Gaius Memmius]], finally declared war on Jugurtha in 111 BC., though with reluctance.<ref>Mommsen, p. 98</ref><ref>''The Encyclopedia of World History'', (Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, 1952), ch. II, p. 92</ref>\n\n[[File:Jugurthine war Numidia-en.svg|thumb|300px|[[Numidia]] between 112 and 105 B.C. and main battles of the war.]]\n\n==Bestia==\n[[Lucius Calpurnius Bestia (consul 111 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Bestia]], consul for the year, was appointed to command the Roman army in Africa against Jugurtha; he was accompanied by Scaurus and other experienced officers and received an offer of alliance from Bocchus, king of Mauretania. The defection of Bocchus, his own father-in-law, filled Jugurtha with alarm, and he sent to the Roman consul to surrender.<ref>Mommsen, ibid</ref> Whereupon the Roman senators, no longer looking on him as a threat, allowed themselves to be bribed into granting him a treaty on extremely lenient terms; Numidia was restored to Jugurtha intact, and a small fine and the remittal of his war-elephants (which he later bought back at reduced price from corrupt officers), was the only price he was forced to pay for his crimes.<ref name=mom99>Mommsen, p. 99</ref> In fact, so favourable were Jugurtha's terms of surrender that it led to a renewal of the popular outcry at Rome; at the demand of the Tribune Memmius, an investigation was launched into the proceedings of the treaty.<ref name=mom99/> Jugurtha was summoned to Rome \u2013 with the promise of a safe-conduct \u2013 and appeared as a witness; but, rather than complying with the inquisition, bribed two Roman [[Tribune]]s to veto the proceedings and prevent him from testifying. In the ensuing outrage, Jugurtha's cousin Massiva, who had fled to Rome in fear of his cousin, seized the opportunity to press his own claim to the Numidian throne. Jugurtha assassinated him, and the Senate, though initially inclined to accept bribery again to allow him to escape retribution,<ref>Froude, p. 35</ref> was ultimately compelled by his insolence and by the fury of the mob to expel him from the city and revoke the recent peace.<ref>Mommsen, p. 100</ref>\n\n==Spurius, Aulus Postumius==\nThe consul [[Spurius Postumius Albinus (consul 110 BC)|Spurius Postumius Albinus]] took command of the Roman army in Africa (110 BC), but failed to carry out energetic action, due to incompetence, indiscipline in his army, and \u2013 it was alleged \u2013 [[bribery]] by Jugurtha. Later in the year Albinus returned to Italy, leaving the command to his brother, [[Aulus Postumius Albinus Magnus]]. The latter, more active though no more able than his brother, decided on a bold stroke, marching in mid-winter to besiege the town of Suthul, where the Numidian treasury was kept; however, the town was strongly garrisoned and excellently fortified and could not be captured. Postumius, anxious not to have retreated without striking the enemy a blow, allowed Jugurtha to lure him into the desolate wilds of the [[Sahara]], where the cunning Numidian king, who had reportedly bribed Roman officers to facilitate his attack, was able to catch the Romans at a disadvantage. Half the Roman army were killed, and the survivors were forced to pass under the yoke in a disgraceful symbolism of surrender.<ref>Froude, p. 36</ref> The beaten Postumius signed a treaty resigning Numidia to Jugurtha and returning to the peace concluded with Bestia and [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Scaurus]]. The [[Roman Senate]], however, when it heard of this capitulation, refused to honour the conditions and continued the war.<ref>Mommsen, Ibid</ref>\n\n==Metellus==\nAfter Postumius' defeat, the Senate finally shook itself from its lethargy, appointing as commander in Africa the plebeian noble [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Quintus Metellus]], who had a reputation for integrity and courage. Metellus proved the soundness of his judgement by selecting as officers for the campaign men of ability rather than of rank, as the former tribune [[Gaius Marius]] (a plebeian from Arpinum) and the noted disciplinarian and military theorist [[Publius Rutilius Rufus]].<ref>Mommsen, p. 102</ref> {{Clarification needed|reason=|date=June 2019}} When Metellus arrived in Africa in 109 BC, he first had to retrain the army and institute some for of discipline.<ref>Marc Hyden, ''Gaius Marius'', p. 46; Eutropius, ''Epitome of Roman History'', 4.27.</ref><ref>Mommsen, ibid</ref>\nIn spring of 109, Metellus led his reorganised army into Numidia; Jugurtha was alarmed and attempted negotiation, but Metellus prevaricated; and, without granting Jugurtha terms, he conspired with Jugurtha's envoys to capture Jugurtha and deliver him to the Romans. The crafty Jugurtha, guessing Metellus' intentions, broke up negotiation and retreated, withdrew south beyond the Numidian mountains and took up position on the plains behind.<ref name=mom103>Mommsen, p. 103</ref>\nMetellus followed and crossed the mountains into the desert, advancing to the river Muthul. Jugurtha had divided his army into two detachments, one of which (composed of cavalry and the best of his infantry) lay south of the mountain on the right flank of the Romans, who were marching to the river Muthul, which lay parallel to the mountains, 18 miles to the south; the second lay further south, closer to the river (formed of war-elephants and the rest of the infantry).<ref name=mom103/>\nMetellus handled the situation by sending one force directly south to the river under Rufus while the rest under Metellus and Marius marched obliquely south-west to dislodge Jugurtha from his position and prevent him from hindering the march of the first body to the river. Jugurtha, however, displaying excellent generalship, dispatched a column of infantry to hold the mountain passes as soon as the Romans had descended into the plain, thus cutting off their line of retreat; while his cavalry harried Metellus' detachment of infantry in swarms along the plain \u2013 to which the Romans were unable to properly respond, since they had no cavalry themselves.<ref name=mom103/> Meanwhile, Rufus had advanced to the river but was attacked by Jugurtha's southern force; thus, the two Roman armies were incapable of coming to each other's relief. However, although Metellus' army was now entrapped in the desert with fewer troops and inferior generalship, the Romans still prevailed simultaneously on both fronts. Rufus overpowered the southern detachment by a forward charge, sending the elephants and infantry of the enemy flying across the desert; while Metellus and Marius, rallying a group of legionaries, charged to occupy the single hill on the plain, which commanded the situation. The inferior Numidian soldiers of Jugurtha were powerless before the advance of Roman infantry and scattered into the desert with severe losses. Metellus had won the [[Battle of the Muthul]], but since the Numidian king had escaped the war was far from over.<ref name=mom104>Mommsen, p. 104</ref>\n\nAfter this defeat a fresh round of negotiations ensued between Jugurtha and the Roman commander. Although Jugurtha offered heavy concessions, they were ultimately unsuccessful because Metellus believed the war could only end with the capture of Jugurtha, who refused to become a prisoner.<ref>Mommsen, p. 105</ref> To resist the Romans more effectually, Jugurtha dismissed most of his low-quality recruits, keeping only the most active troops of infantry and light cavalry, in order to maintain the war by guerrilla tactics.<ref name=mom104/> Metellus advanced once again, capturing town after town, but was unable to capture his enemy. Though another engagement took place in which Jugurtha was defeated, the latter was able to retreat, falling back with his family and treasure boxes to the desert fortress of Thala, which was inaccessible except by an excruciating march of three days through the desert without water. Metellus furnished his army with skins for water transport and followed to besiege the fortress, which fell after forty days. However, Jugurtha managed to escape from the flaming wreckage, undoing all of Metellus' efforts.<ref name=mom106>Mommsen, p. 106</ref>\n\nAt this point Jugurtha retired to the court of his father-in-law, king [[Bocchus I]] of [[Mauretania]], who though previously professing friendship for the Romans, now received Jugurtha hospitably, and, without positively declaring war (on Rome), advanced with his troops into Numidia as far as Cirta, the capital.<ref name=mom106/> Metellus, who had taken up winter quarters in the area after the conclusion of the campaign, began negotiation with Bocchus to hand over Jugurtha. But before an agreement could be reached, Metellus was deposed from his command by the Roman [[Tribal Assembly]] and replaced by his lieutenant, Gaius Marius.<ref>Mommsen, p. 107</ref> An internal struggle in the Roman camp between Metellus and Marius led to this change of command. Metellus looked unfavourably on Marius's known ambitions in Roman politics and refused for days to allow him to sail to Rome and stand for the consulship. Eventually, Metellus permitted Marius to return to Rome and Marius was elected consul in 107. Metellus was, however, unaware that Marius wanted his command in Numidia.

Jugurtha was the nephew and adopted son of [[Micipsa]], [[King of Numidia]], whom he succeeded on the throne, overcoming his rivals through assassination, war, and bribery.\n\nThe war constituted an important phase in the Roman subjugation of Northern Africa, but Numidia did not become a Roman province until 46 BC. Following Jugurtha's usurpation of the throne of Numidia,<ref>Sallust, ''The Jugurthine War'', XII</ref> a loyal ally of Rome since the Punic Wars,<ref>Matyszak, ''The Enemies of Rome'', p. 64</ref> Rome felt compelled to intervene.\n\n==Jugurtha and Numidia==\n\n[[Numidia]] was a kingdom located in [[North Africa]] (roughly corresponding to northern modern day [[Algeria]]) adjacent to what had been [[Roman Republic|Rome]]'s arch enemy, [[Carthage]]. King [[Masinissa]], who was a steadfast ally of Rome in the [[Third Punic War]], died in 149, and was succeeded by his son [[Micipsa]], who ruled 149-118 BC. At the time of his death Micipsa had three potential heirs, his two sons, [[Adherbal (king of Numidia)|Adherbal]] and [[Hiempsal I]], and an illegitimate nephew, [[Jugurtha]]. Jugurtha had fought under [[Scipio Aemilianus]] at the siege of Numantia, where, through friendship with Roman aristocrats, he had formed an acquaintance with Roman manners and military tactics. Micipsa, worried that at his death Jugurtha would usurp the kingdom from his own somewhat less able sons, adopted him, and bequeathed the kingship jointly to his two sons and Jugurtha.<ref>[[J. A. Froude]], ''Caesar- A Sketch'', ([[A. L. Burt]] Company, New York, 1903), ch. IV, pp. 33, 34</ref> After King Micipsa's death the three kings fell out, and ultimately agreed between themselves to divide their inheritance into three separate kingdoms;<ref>[[T. Mommsen]], ''The History of Rome'', (The Colonial Press, Massachusetts, 1958), ch. III, p. 94</ref> however, they were unable to agree on the terms of division, and Jugurtha declared open war on his cousins; Hiempsal, who, though the younger, was the braver of the brothers, was assassinated by Jugurtha's agents, and Adherbal, unable to defend himself, was defeated and forced to flee to Rome, where he appealed for arbitration to the [[Roman Senate]].<ref>Mommsen, p. 95</ref>\n\nAlthough the Senate were securities for Micipsa's will, they now allowed themselves to be bribed by Jugurtha into overlooking his crimes, and organized a commission, led by the ex-[[Consul]] [[Lucius Opimius]], to fairly divide Numidia between the remaining contestants (116 BC). However, Jugurtha bribed the Roman officials in the commission into allotting him the better, more fertile and populous western half of Numidia, while Adherbal received the east.<ref name=mom96>Mommsen, p. 96</ref> Powerless against Roman corruption, Adherbal accepted and peace was made. Shortly after, in 113 BC, Jugurtha again declared war on his brother, and defeated him, forcing him to retreat into [[Cirta]], Adherbal's capital.<ref name=mom96/> Adherbal held out for some months, aided by a large number of Roman Equites who had settled in Africa for commercial purposes. From inside his siege lines, Adherbal appealed again to Rome, and the Senate dispatched a message to Jugurtha to desist. The latter ignored the demand, and the Senate sent a second commission, this time headed by [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Marcus Scaurus]], a respected member of the aristocracy, to threaten the Numidian king into submission. The king, pretending to be open to discussion, protracted negotiations with Scaurus long enough for Cirta to run out of provisions and hope of relief. When Scaurus left without having forced Jugurtha to a commitment, Adherbal surrendered. Jugurtha promptly had him executed, along with the Romans who had joined in the defence of Cirta.<ref>Mommsen, p. 97</ref> But the deaths of Roman citizens caused an immediate furore among the commoners at home, and the Senate, threatened by the popular tribune [[Gaius Memmius (tribune)|Gaius Memmius]], finally declared war on Jugurtha in 111 BC., though with reluctance.<ref>Mommsen, p. 98</ref><ref>''The Encyclopedia of World History'', (Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, 1952), ch. II, p. 92</ref>\n\n[[File:Jugurthine war Numidia-en.svg|thumb|300px|[[Numidia]] between 112 and 105 B.C. and main battles of the war.]]\n\n==Bestia==\n[[Lucius Calpurnius Bestia (consul 111 BC)|Lucius Calpurnius Bestia]], consul for the year, was appointed to command the Roman army in Africa against Jugurtha; he was accompanied by Scaurus and other experienced officers and received an offer of alliance from Bocchus, king of Mauretania. The defection of Bocchus, his own father-in-law, filled Jugurtha with alarm, and he sent to the Roman consul to surrender.<ref>Mommsen, ibid</ref> Whereupon the Roman senators, no longer looking on him as a threat, allowed themselves to be bribed into granting him a treaty on extremely lenient terms; Numidia was restored to Jugurtha intact, and a small fine and the remittal of his war-elephants (which he later bought back at reduced price from corrupt officers), was the only price he was forced to pay for his crimes.<ref name=mom99>Mommsen, p. 99</ref> In fact, so favourable were Jugurtha's terms of surrender that it led to a renewal of the popular outcry at Rome; at the demand of the Tribune Memmius, an investigation was launched into the proceedings of the treaty.<ref name=mom99/> Jugurtha was summoned to Rome \u2013 with the promise of a safe-conduct \u2013 and appeared as a witness; but, rather than complying with the inquisition, bribed two Roman [[Tribune]]s to veto the proceedings and prevent him from testifying. In the ensuing outrage, Jugurtha's cousin Massiva, who had fled to Rome in fear of his cousin, seized the opportunity to press his own claim to the Numidian throne. Jugurtha assassinated him, and the Senate, though initially inclined to accept bribery again to allow him to escape retribution,<ref>Froude, p. 35</ref> was ultimately compelled by his insolence and by the fury of the mob to expel him from the city and revoke the recent peace.<ref>Mommsen, p. 100</ref>\n\n==Spurius, Aulus Postumius==\nThe consul [[Spurius Postumius Albinus (consul 110 BC)|Spurius Postumius Albinus]] took command of the Roman army in Africa (110 BC), but failed to carry out energetic action, due to incompetence, indiscipline in his army, and \u2013 it was alleged \u2013 [[bribery]] by Jugurtha. Later in the year Albinus returned to Italy, leaving the command to his brother, [[Aulus Postumius Albinus Magnus]]. The latter, more active though no more able than his brother, decided on a bold stroke, marching in mid-winter to besiege the town of Suthul, where the Numidian treasury was kept; however, the town was strongly garrisoned and excellently fortified and could not be captured. Postumius, anxious not to have retreated without striking the enemy a blow, allowed Jugurtha to lure him into the desolate wilds of the [[Sahara]], where the cunning Numidian king, who had reportedly bribed Roman officers to facilitate his attack, was able to catch the Romans at a disadvantage. Half the Roman army were killed, and the survivors were forced to pass under the yoke in a disgraceful symbolism of surrender.<ref>Froude, p. 36</ref> The beaten Postumius signed a treaty resigning Numidia to Jugurtha and returning to the peace concluded with Bestia and [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)|Scaurus]]. The [[Roman Senate]], however, when it heard of this capitulation, refused to honour the conditions and continued the war.<ref>Mommsen, Ibid</ref>\n\n==Metellus==\nAfter Postumius' defeat, the Senate finally shook itself from its lethargy, appointing as commander in Africa the plebeian noble [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Quintus Metellus]], who had a reputation for integrity and courage. Metellus proved the soundness of his judgement by selecting as officers for the campaign men of ability rather than of rank, as the former tribune [[Gaius Marius]] (a plebeian from Arpinum) and the noted disciplinarian and military theorist [[Publius Rutilius Rufus]].<ref>Mommsen, p. 102</ref> {{Clarification needed|reason=|date=June 2019}} When Metellus arrived in Africa in 109 BC, he first had to retrain the army and institute some for of discipline.<ref>Marc Hyden, ''Gaius Marius'', p. 46; Eutropius, ''Epitome of Roman History'', 4.27.</ref><ref>Mommsen, ibid</ref>\nIn spring of 109, Metellus led his reorganised army into Numidia; Jugurtha was alarmed and attempted negotiation, but Metellus prevaricated; and, without granting Jugurtha terms, he conspired with Jugurtha's envoys to capture Jugurtha and deliver him to the Romans. The crafty Jugurtha, guessing Metellus' intentions, broke up negotiation and retreated, withdrew south beyond the Numidian mountains and took up position on the plains behind.<ref name=mom103>Mommsen, p. 103</ref>\nMetellus followed and crossed the mountains into the desert, advancing to the river Muthul. Jugurtha had divided his army into two detachments, one of which (composed of cavalry and the best of his infantry) lay south of the mountain on the right flank of the Romans, who were marching to the river Muthul, which lay parallel to the mountains, 18 miles to the south; the second lay further south, closer to the river (formed of war-elephants and the rest of the infantry).<ref name=mom103/>\nMetellus handled the situation by sending one force directly south to the river under Rufus while the rest under Metellus and Marius marched obliquely south-west to dislodge Jugurtha from his position and prevent him from hindering the march of the first body to the river. Jugurtha, however, displaying excellent generalship, dispatched a column of infantry to hold the mountain passes as soon as the Romans had descended into the plain, thus cutting off their line of retreat; while his cavalry harried Metellus' detachment of infantry in swarms along the plain \u2013 to which the Romans were unable to properly respond, since they had no cavalry themselves.<ref name=mom103/> Meanwhile, Rufus had advanced to the river but was attacked by Jugurtha's southern force; thus, the two Roman armies were incapable of coming to each other's relief. However, although Metellus' army was now entrapped in the desert with fewer troops and inferior generalship, the Romans still prevailed simultaneously on both fronts. Rufus overpowered the southern detachment by a forward charge, sending the elephants and infantry of the enemy flying over the desert; while Metellus and Marius, rallying a group of legionaries, charged to occupy the single hill on the plain, which commanded the situation. The inferior Numidian soldiers of Jugurtha were powerless before the advance of Roman infantry and scattered into the desert with severe losses. Metellus had won the [[Battle of the Muthul]], but since the Numidian king had escaped the war was far from over.<ref name=mom104>Mommsen, p. 104</ref>\n\nAfter this defeat a fresh round of negotiations ensued between Jugurtha and the Roman commander. Although Jugurtha offered heavy concessions, they were ultimately unsuccessful because Metellus believed the war could only end with the capture of Jugurtha, who refused to become a prisoner.<ref>Mommsen, p. 105</ref> To resist the Romans more effectually, Jugurtha dismissed most of his low-quality recruits, keeping only the most active troops of infantry and light cavalry, in order to maintain the war by guerrilla tactics.<ref name=mom104/> Metellus advanced once again, capturing town after town, but was unable to capture his enemy. Though another engagement took place in which Jugurtha was defeated, the latter was able to retreat, falling back with his family and treasure boxes to the desert fortress of Thala, which was inaccessible except by an excruciating march of three days through the desert without water. Metellus furnished his army with skins for water transport and followed to besiege the fortress, which fell after forty days. However, Jugurtha managed to escape from the flaming wreckage, undoing all of Metellus' efforts.<ref name=mom106>Mommsen, p. 106</ref>\n\nAt this point Jugurtha retired to the court of his father-in-law, king [[Bocchus I]] of [[Mauretania]], who though previously professing friendship for the Romans, now received Jugurtha hospitably, and, without positively declaring war (on Rome), advanced with his troops into Numidia as far as Cirta, the capital.<ref name=mom106/> Metellus, who had taken up winter quarters in the area after the conclusion of the campaign, began negotiation with Bocchus to hand over Jugurtha. But before an agreement could be reached, Metellus was deposed from his command by the Roman [[Tribal Assembly]] and replaced by his lieutenant, Gaius Marius.<ref>Mommsen, p. 107</ref> An internal struggle in the Roman camp between Metellus and Marius led to this change of command. Metellus looked unfavourably on Marius's known ambitions in Roman politics and refused for days to allow him to sail to Rome and stand for the consulship. Eventually, Metellus permitted Marius to return to Rome and Marius was elected consul in 107. Metellus was, however, unaware that Marius wanted his command in Numidia. Numidia was not an area designated to be assigned to a consul by the Roman Senate. However, the populares passed a law in its [[Tribal Assembly]] which gave the command against Jugurtha to Marius in 107. This was significant because the Assembly usurped the Senate's rights and powers in this matter and the Senate yielded.<ref name=mom108>Mommsen, p. 108</ref> \n\nMetellus was furious at all these developments and decided to make Marius's command a lot more difficult by refusing his legions to serve under Marius.<ref name=LTsul43>Lynda Telford, ''Sulla, A Dictator Reconsidered'', p.43</ref> He [Metellus] sent them back to Italy to join the army of the other consul, [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], who was about to march north to confront a [[Cimbrian War|Germanic invasion of Gaul]].<ref name=LTsul43/>\n\n==Marius==\n\nMarius found Rome's traditional manpower reserves depleted.

Their less than stellar performance and tardiness gets them the occasional lecture from their Sensei, Kanoi Watanabe. One day, the academy is attacked by Lothor, a banished ninja master and Kanoi's brother, who has returned to capture all the ninja students. Shane, Tori and Dustin are the only three remaining students, and along with Sensei, who has been transformed into a guinea pig by Lothor, and his son Cam, retreat into the underground Ninja Ops. There, the three are given Wind Morphers, which allow them to transform into Wind Power Rangers and protect the city of Blue Bay Harbor from Lothor's forces.\n\nWhen Lothor demonstrates his ability to make his monsters grow, the Rangers unleash the Ninja Zords, which could combine into the Storm Megazord and destroy monsters with its arsenal of Power Spheres, activated by special ninja power disks. Lothor again raises the stakes by sending his new allies to battle the Wind Rangers - the Thunder Rangers, Blake and Hunter Bradley, who had their own Thunder Zords. The Thunder Rangers are on a mission to destroy the Wind Rangers' Sensei, who they believed to be responsible for their parent's death, but a visit from the afterlife from Blake and Hunter's parents show them the truth - that it was Lothor who killed them. The Thunder Rangers see the error of their ways and join the Wind Rangers in the battle against Lothor, bringing the Thunder and Ninja Zords together to form the Thunderstorm Megazord.\n\nWhen the Rangers lose their powers, Cam uses the Scroll of Time to travel into the past and retrieve the Samurai Amulet, a family heirloom in the possession of his late mother, where he discovers how Lothor rose to power. Cam returns to the present and uses the amulet to become the Green Samurai Ranger, armed with the Samurai Star Megazord, which later combines with the Rangers' zords to form the Hurricane Megazord. A lost scroll would later reveal to Cam the Lightning Riff Blaster, which could summon the Mighty Mammoth Zord.\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to take over the world, Lothor attempts to open the Abyss of Evil and release its evil. In a final battle, he steals the Samurai Amulet and uses it to take away all of the Rangers's powers. However the Wind Rangers combine their inner ninja powers to overpower Lothor and throw him into the abyss.
