The return may consist of a gain (or loss) realised from the sale of a property or an investment, unrealised [[capital appreciation]] (or depreciation), or investment income such as [[dividend]]s, [[interest]], rental income etc., or a combination of capital gain and income. The return may also include currency gains or losses due to changes in the foreign currency [[Exchange rate|exchange rates]].\n\n[[Investor]]s generally expect higher [[rate of return|returns]] from [[Financial risk|riskier]] their investments. When a low risk investment is made, the return is also generally low. Similarly, high risk comes with high returns. \n\nInvestors, particularly novices, are often advised to adopt a particular [[investment strategy]] and [[Diversification (finance)|diversify]] their [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]]. Diversification has the [[statistics|statistical]] effect of reducing overall [[Financial risk|risk]].\n\n==Terminology and risk==\nAn investor may bear a [[Financial risk|risk]] of loss of some or all of their [[Financial capital|capital]] invested. Investment differs from [[arbitrage]], in which [[profit (accounting)|profit]] is generated without investing capital or bearing risk.\n\n[[Saving|Savings]] bear the (normally remote) risk that the financial provider may default. \n\n[[Foreign currency]] savings also bear [[foreign exchange risk]]: if the currency of a savings account differs from the account holder's home currency, then there is the risk that the exchange rate between the two currencies will move unfavorably, so that the value of the savings account decreases, measured in the account holder's home currency.\n\nIn contrast with savings, investments tend to carry more risk, in the form of both a wider variety of risk factors, and a greater level of uncertainty.\n\n== History ==\n{{expand section|date=October 2018}}\nThe [[Code of Hammurabi]] (around 1700 BC) provided a legal framework for investment, establishing a means for the pledge of collateral by codifying debtor and creditor rights in regard to pledged land. Punishments for breaking financial obligations were not as severe as those for crimes involving injury or death.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Code of Hammurabi|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/ancient/hamframe.asp|website=The Avalon Project; Documents in Law, History and Diplomacy}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], the [[qirad]] was a major financial instrument. This was an arrangement between one or more investors and an agent where the investors entruste capital to an agent who then traded with it in hopes of making profit.  Both parties then received a previously settled portion of the profit, though the agent was not liable for any losses. Many will notice that the qirad is almost identical to the institution of the [[Limited partnership|commenda]] later used in western Europe, though whether the qirad transformed into the commenda, or the two institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty.<ref>Robert H. Hillman, \"Limited Liability in Historical Perspective\", (Washington and Lee Law Review, Spring 1997), Benedikt Koehler, \"Islamic Finance as a Progenitor of Venture Capital\", (Economic Affairs, December 2009)</ref>\n\nIn the early 1900s, purchasers of stocks, bonds, and other securities were described in media, academia, and commerce as speculators. Since the [[Wall Street crash of 1929]], and particularly by the 1950s, the term investment had come to denote the more conservative end of the securities spectrum, while speculation was applied by financial brokers and their advertising agencies to higher risk securities much in vogue at that time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-1929-stock-market-crash/|title=The 1929 Stock Market Crash|website=eh.net|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> Since the last half of the 20th century, the terms speculation and speculator have specifically referred to higher risk ventures.\n\n==Types of investments==\n{{main|Traditional investments|Alternative investment}}\n{{empty section|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Investment strategies==\n\n===Value investment===\n{{main|Value investing}}\nA value investor buys assets that they believe to be undervalued (and sells overvalued ones). To identify undervalued securities, a value investor uses analysis of the financial reports of the issuer to evaluate the security. Value investors employ accounting ratios, such as [[earnings per share]] and sales growth, to identify securities trading at prices below their worth.\n\n[[Warren Buffett]] and [[Benjamin Graham]] are notable examples of value investors. Graham and [[David Dodd|Dodd's]] seminal work, [[Security Analysis]], was written in the wake of the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Security Analysis: The Classic 1940 Edition|last=Graham|first=Benjamin|last2=Dodd|first2=David|date=2002-10-31|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9780071412285|edition=2|location=New York; London|language=English}}</ref>\n\nThe [[price to earnings ratio]] (P/E), or earnings multiple, is a particularly significant and recognized fundamental ratio, with a function of dividing the share price of stock, by its [[earnings per share]]. This will provide the value representing the sum investors are prepared to expend for each dollar of company earnings. This ratio is an important aspect, due to its capacity as measurement for the comparison of valuations of various companies. A stock with a lower P/E ratio will cost less per share than one with a higher P/E, taking into account the same level of [[financial]] performance; therefore, it essentially means a low P/E is the preferred option.<ref>{{cite web|title=Price-Earnings Ratio - P/E Ratio|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/price-earningsratio.asp|website=Investopedia}}</ref>\n\nAn instance in which the price to earnings ratio has a lesser significance is when companies in different industries are compared. For example, although it is reasonable for a telecommunications stock to show a P/E in the low teens, in the case of hi-tech stock, a P/E in the 40s range is not unusual. When making comparisons, the P/E ratio can give you a refined view of a particular stock valuation.\n\nFor investors paying for each dollar of a company's earnings, the P/E ratio is a significant indicator, but the [[price-to-book ratio]] (P/B) is also a reliable indication of how much investors are willing to spend on each dollar of company assets. In the process of the P/B ratio, the share price of a stock is divided by its net assets; any intangibles, such as goodwill, are not taken into account. It is a crucial factor of the price-to-book ratio, due to it indicating the actual payment for tangible assets and not the more difficult valuation of intangibles. Accordingly, the P/B could be considered a comparatively conservative metric.\n\n==Intermediaries and collective investments==\nInvestments are often made indirectly through [[intermediary]] financial institutions. These intermediaries include [[Pension fund|pension funds]], [[bank]]s, and [[insurance]] companies. They may pool money received from a number of individual end investors into funds such as [[investment trust]]s, [[unit trust]]s, [[SICAV]]s, etc. to make large-scale investments. Each individual investor holds an indirect or direct claim on the assets purchased, subject to charges levied by the intermediary, which may be large and varied.\n\nApproaches to investment sometimes referred to in marketing of collective investments include [[dollar cost averaging]] and [[market timing]].\n\n==Famous investors==\nInvestors famous for their success include [[Warren Buffett]]. In the March 2013 edition of ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, Warren Buffett ranked number 2 in their [[Forbes 400]] list.<ref>{{cite web|last=Editor|title=Forbes 400: Warren Buffett|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/warren-buffett/|work=Forbes Magazine|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref> Buffett has advised in numerous articles and interviews that a good investment strategy is long-term and [[due diligence]] is the key to investing in the right assets.\n\n[[Edward O. Thorp]] was a highly successful [[hedge fund]] manager in the 1970s and 1980s who spoke of a similar approach.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thorp|first=Edward|title=Kelly Capital Growth Investment Criterion|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GherKrR0X5cC|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=9789814293495|year=2010}}</ref>\n\nThe investment principles of both of these investors have points in common with the [[Kelly criterion]] for money management.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Kelly Formula: Growth Optimized Money Management|url=http://seekingalpha.com/article/250811-the-kelly-formula-growth-optimized-money-management-not-for-the-faint-of-heart|work=Seeking Alpha|publisher=Healthy Wealthy Wise Project}}</ref> Numerous interactive calculators which use the Kelly criterion can be found online.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jacques|first=Ryan|title=Kelly Calculator Investment Tool|url=http://rldinvestments.com/Kelly%20Calculator/js/Money%20Management.html|accessdate=7 October 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320083723/http://rldinvestments.com/Kelly%20Calculator/js/Money%20Management.html|archive-date=2012-03-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Investment valuation==\n[[Free cash flow]] measures the cash a company generates which is available to its debt and equity investors, after allowing for reinvestment in [[working capital]] and [[capital expenditure]]. High and rising free cash flow therefore tend to make a company more attractive to investors.\n\nThe [[debt-to-equity ratio]] is an indicator of [[capital structure]]. A high proportion of [[debt]], reflected in a high debt-to-equity ratio, tends to make a company's [[earnings]], free cash flow, and ultimately the returns to its investors, more risky or [[volatility (finance)|volatile]]. Investors compare a company's debt-to-equity ratio with those of other companies in the same industry, and examine trends in debt-to-equity ratios and free cash flow.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Asset]]\n*[[Capital accumulation]]\n*[[Capital gains tax]]\n*[[Diversification (finance)]]\n*[[EBITDA]]\n*[[Financial risk]]\n*[[Foreign direct investment]]\n*[[Fundamental analysis]]\n*[[Fundamental Analysis Software]]\n*[[Hedge fund]]\n*[[List of countries by gross fixed investment as percentage of GDP]]\n*[[List of economics topics]]\n*[[Market sentiment]]\n*[[Mortgage investment corporation]]\n*[[Rate of return]]\n*[[Socially responsible investing]]\n*[[Specialized investment fund]]\n*[[Technical analysis]]\n*[[Time value of money]]\n*[[Mutual_fund|Mutual Fund]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{commons category|Investments}}\n{{NSRW Poster|Investments}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* {{dmoz|Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds/Equities/Research_and_Analysis/|Investing}}\n<!--======================== {{No more links}} ============================\n    | PLEASE BE CAUTIOUS IN ADDING MORE LINKS TO THIS ARTICLE.

He is known for his [[dark comedy]] style, which emphasizes ironic misdirection, [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non sequitur]]s, biting insults, an arrogant demeanor, and a [[stage persona]] that frequently takes [[amorality|amoral]] stances.\n\nJeselnik was a writer for ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' in its first season and hosted a ''[[Comedy Central Presents]]'' in 2009. After releasing his critically acclaimed debut album ''[[Shakespeare (album)|Shakespeare]]'' in 2010, he began writing for the [[Comedy Central Roasts]] and moved up to performer in the 2011 roast of [[Donald Trump]]. He continued to perform on the roasts of [[Charlie Sheen]] and [[Roseanne Barr]] in 2012. In 2013, he hosted his own [[Comedy Central]] series for two seasons, ''[[The Jeselnik Offensive]]'', and released his second album, ''[[Caligula (album)|Caligula]]'', which doubles as an hour-long standup special.\n\nOn July 22, 2015, Jeselnik replaced [[JB Smoove]] as the new host of NBC's Emmy Award-nominated series ''[[Last Comic Standing]]''.<ref>[http://www.nbc.com/last-comic-standing \"Last Comic Standing Returns\"], ''nbc.com'', retrieved June 28, 2015</ref> His second stand-up special, ''Thoughts and Prayers'', premiered in October 2015 on [[Netflix]].\nJeselnik starred in the first season of the NFL Media podcast, titled the Rosenthal and Jeselnik Vanity Project or \"RJVP\" along with best friend Gregg Rosenthal. The second season debuted in 2018 on the [[Comedy Central]] Podcast Network under the slightly different name of Jeselnik and Rosenthal Vanity Project or \"JRVP\".\n\n==Early life==\nAnthony Jeselnik was born in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania, on December 22, 1978, the son of Stephanie and Anthony F. Jeselnik, whose surname and ancestry originates from Slovenia. He was raised in [[Upper St. Clair Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Upper St. Clair]].<ref name=\"collier\">{{Cite news |first=Sean |last=Collier |date=July 2011 |title=King of Zing |magazine=[[Pittsburgh Magazine]] |url=http://www.pittsburghmagazine.com/Pittsburgh-Magazine/July-2011/Anthony-Jeselnik-Rules-the-Roast/ |accessdate=February 17, 2013}}</ref> Jeselnik was interested in making others laugh from an early age. In elementary school, he would often interrupt the class to tell a joke. On one occasion, a classmate was moving to a different town that was not generally regarded well, and Jeselnik cracked a sarcastic comment: \"Oh, well, send us a postcard.\"<ref name=\"avclub\"/> When the teacher laughed at his joke, he realized that \"if you're smart enough that adults get it, you can get away with anything.\"<ref name=\"avclub\"/> He would often stay up attempting to watch ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and, as he grew older, ''[[The Ben Stiller Show]]'' and ''[[Mr. Show]]''.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> He graduated from [[Upper St. Clair High School]] in 1997. Jeselnik earned a bachelor's degree in English literature with a business minor from [[Tulane University]] in 2001. During his senior year at Tulane, his girlfriend accidentally burned down his apartment, which he would later use as early standup material.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> He was a member of the [[Alpha Tau Omega]] fraternity while at [[Tulane University]].  His original dream was to write the [[great American novel]], but an internship in Los Angeles between his junior and senior years of college convinced him there were other avenues for a writer.<ref name=\"postgazette\">{{cite news |first=Rob |last=Owen|date=February 18, 2013|title=TV preview: Anthony Jeselnik loves being the jerk on new comedy show |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/ae/tv-radio/tv-preview-anthony-jeselnik-loves-being-the-jerk-on-new-comedy-show-675878/|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn his early twenties, Jeselnik moved to Los Angeles and was working at a [[Borders Group|Borders]] when he first tried standup.

By the end of the skit&mdash;which lasted only one minute, but Jeselnik claimed \"felt like 10\"&mdash;no one had laughed, leading Jeselnik to swear off physical comedy forever.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> After being fired by Borders, he worked as an accounting clerk for ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'', during which time he would perform at open-mic nights.<ref name=\"avclub\"/> Inspired in part by [[Mitch Hedberg]], [[Dennis Miller]], [[Sarah Silverman]],<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WH8gV8wZgks|title=Anthony Jeselnik does TMI|date=February 16, 2012|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> and [[Steven Wright]], it was two years into his standup comedy career when Jeselnik had a \"lightbulb moment.\"<ref name=\"grantland\"/> After writing a bizarre joke with a dark twist to it, the audience response encouraged Jeselnik to focus more in that area.

His dream job, predating standup or his first comedy class, was to sit around a table and \"throw out jokes with people you respected.\"<ref name=\"grantland\"/> After getting the job, Jeselnik's pitches would be continually shot down as they were too dark.

In elementary school, he would often interrupt the class to tell a joke.

[[Jaan K\u00fcnnap]] with the [[flag of Estonia]] at the top of [[Lenin Peak]] ({{convert|7134|m|abbr=in|disp=sqbr}}) in 1989.]]\nA '''flag''' is a piece of [[textile|fabric]] (most often rectangular or [[quadrilateral]]) with a distinctive design and colours. It is used as a [[symbol]], a signalling device, or for decoration. The term ''flag'' is also used to refer to the [[graphic design]] employed, and flags have evolved into a general tool for rudimentary signalling and identification, especially in environments where communication is challenging (such as the [[Maritime flag|maritime environment]], where [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]] is used). The study of flags is known as \"[[vexillology]]\" from the [[Latin]] ''vexillum'', meaning \"flag\" or \"[[banner]]\".\n\n[[National flag]]s are [[patriotic]] symbols with widely varied interpretations that often include strong [[military]] associations because of their original and ongoing use for that purpose. Flags are also used in [[messaging]], [[advertising]], or for [[decorative]] purposes.\n\nSome military units are called \"flags\" after their use of flags. A ''flag'' (Arabic: \u0644\u0648\u0627\u0621) is equivalent to a [[brigade]] in Arab countries. In Spain, a ''flag'' (Spanish: ''bandera'') is a [[battalion]]-equivalent in the [[Spanish Legion]].\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Vexilloid|Heraldic flag|Royal Standard}}\n[[File:Bronze flag, Shadad Kerman, Iran.JPG|upright|thumb|right|Bronze flag found in [[Shahdad]], [[Iran]], 3rd millennium BC]]\nThe origin of the flag is unknown.<ref>Inglefield, p. 39.</ref> In antiquity, [[field sign]]s or standards were used in warfare that can be categorised as [[vexilloid]] or 'flag-like'. This originated in [[ancient Egypt]] or [[Assyria]].<ref name=\"Britannica\">[https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-heraldry Flag | heraldry]. ''Encyclopedia Britannica''. Retrieved February 15, 2019.</ref> Examples include the [[Sassanid]] battle standard [[Derafsh Kaviani]], and the standards of the [[Roman legion]]s such as the [[aquila (Roman)|eagle]] of [[Augustus Caesar]]'s [[Legio X Fretensis|Xth legion]], or the [[Draconarius|dragon standard]] of the [[Sarmatians]]; the latter was let fly freely in the wind, carried by a horseman, but judging from depictions it was more similar to an elongated [[dragon kite]] than to a simple flag.\n\nFlags as recognized today, made of a piece of cloth representing a particular entity, were invented in the [[Indian subcontinent]] or [[ancient China|Chinese]] [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046-256 BCE). Chinese flags depicted colorful animals and royal flags were to be treated with a similar level of respect attributed to the ruler. Indian flags were often triangular and decorated with attachments such as [[yak]]'s tail and the state umbrella. These usages spread to [[Southeast Asia]] as well, and were transmitted to Europe through the [[Muslim world]] where plainly colored flags were being used due to [[Aniconism in Islam|Islamic proscriptions]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nIn [[Europe]], during the [[High Middle Ages]], flags came to be used primarily as a [[heraldic flag|heraldic device]] in battle, allowing more easily to identify a knight than only from the heraldic device painted on the shield. Already during the high medieval period, and increasingly during the [[Late Middle Ages]], [[city state]]s and [[medieval commune|communes]] such as those of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] also began to use flags as field signs. Regimental flags for individual units became commonplace during the [[Early Modern period]].\n\n[[File:Sujagi (1871).jpg|upright|left|thumb|''[[Sujagi]]'' of [[Eo Jae-yeon]], captured in 1871]]\n\nDuring the peak of the [[age of sail]], beginning in the early 17th century, it was customary (and later a legal requirement) for ships to carry flags designating their nationality;<ref>Articles 90\u201394 of the [[UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]]</ref> these flags eventually evolved into the national flags and [[maritime flags]] of today. Flags also became the preferred means of [[communication]]s at sea, resulting in various systems of flag signals; ''see, [[International maritime signal flags]]''.\n\nUse of flags outside of military or naval context begins only with the rise of [[nationalism|nationalist]] sentiment by the end of the 18th century, although some flags date back earlier. The flags of countries such as Austria, Denmark or Turkey emerged from the midst of legend while many others, including those of Poland and Switzerland, grew out of the heraldic emblems of the Middle Ages. The 17th century saw the birth of several [[national flag]]s through revolutionary struggle. One of these was the flag of the Netherlands, which appeared during the 80-year Dutch rebellion which began in 1568 against Spanish domination.<ref>Inglefield, p. 48.</ref>\n\nPolitical change and social reform, allied to a growing sense of nationhood among ordinary people, led to the birth of new nations and flags all over the world in the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>Inglefield, p. 50.</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==National flags==\n{{Main|National flag}}\n[[File:Flags at half-staff outside Central Plaza.jpg|thumb|Flags at [[half-mast]] outside [[Central Plaza, Hong Kong]], after the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]]. The [[Flag of Saudi Arabia]] is exempted.]]\n[[File:Meeting Place Monument.JPG|thumb|Tribal flags at Meeting Place Monument/Flag Plaza at the Oklahoma State Capitol]]\n\nOne of the most popular uses of a flag is to symbolise a [[nation]] or [[country]]. Some [[national flag]]s have been particularly inspirational to other nations, countries, or subnational entities in the design of their own flags. Some prominent examples include:\n[[File:Dannebrog isams\u00f8.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Danish national flag (Dannebrog) waving in [[Sams\u00f8]] ]]\n* The [[flag of Denmark]], the ''Dannebrog'', is attested in 1478, and is the oldest national flag still in use. It inspired the [[Nordic Cross Flag|cross design]] of the other [[Nordic countries]]: [[Flag of Norway|Norway]], [[Flag of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Flag of Finland|Finland]], [[Flag of Iceland|Iceland]], and regional Scandinavian flags for the [[Flag of the Faroe Islands|Faroe Islands]], [[Flag of \u00c5land|\u00c5land]], [[Flag of Sk\u00e5neland|Scania]] and [[Flag of Bornholm|Bornholm]], as well as flags for the non-Scandinavian [[Flag of Shetland|Shetland]] and [[Flag of Orkney|Orkney]].<ref>[http://denmark.dk/en/quick-facts/national-flag/ National Flag -The official website of Denmark]. Earlier use of the white cross on red is attested by an armorial (Netherlands) of 1370-1386. In later monastic tradition, the Dannebrog made its first, miraculous appearance at the Battle of Lindanise on 15 June 1219.</ref>\n* The [[flag of the Netherlands]] is the oldest [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]]. Its three colours of red, white and blue go back to [[Charlemagne]]'s time, the 9th century. The coastal region of what today is the Netherlands was then known for its cloth in these colours. Maps from the early 16th century already put flags in these colours next to this region, like Texeira's map of 1520. A century before that, during the 15th century, the three colours were mentioned as the coastal signals for this area, with the three bands straight or diagonal, single or doubled. As [[state flag]] it first appeared around 1572 as the [[Prince's Flag]] in orange\u2013white\u2013blue. Soon the more famous red\u2013white\u2013blue began appearing, becoming the prevalent version from around 1630. Orange made a comeback during the civil war of the late 18th century, signifying the orangist or pro-[[stadtholder]] party. During World War II the pro-Nazi [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|NSB]] used it. Any symbolism has been added later to the three colours, although the orange comes from the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. This use of orange comes from Nassau, which today uses orange-blue, not from Orange, which today uses red-blue. However, the usual way to show the link with the House of Orange-Nassau is the orange pennant above the red-white-blue.  It is said that the Dutch Tricolour has inspired<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-France|title=flag of France {{!}} History & Meaning|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>{{Citation needed |date=October 2007}} many flags but most notably those of [[Russia]], [[New York City]], and [[South Africa]] (the 1928\u201394 flag as well the current flag).  As the probable inspiration for the Russian flag, it is the source too for the [[Pan-Slavic colours]] red, white and blue, adopted by many [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] states and peoples as their symbols; examples are [[Flag of Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Flag of Serbia|Serbia]], and [[Flag of Slovenia|Slovenia]].\n* The national [[flag of France]] was designed in 1794. As a forerunner of revolution, France's tricolour flag style has been adopted by other nations. Examples: [[Flag of Italy|Italy]], [[flag of Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[flag of Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]], [[Flag of Ireland|Ireland]], [[flag of Haiti|Haiti]],{{Citation needed|reason=The flag of Haiti is a bicolour flag blazed with its coat of arms, seemingly unrelated to the French Tricolore.|date=October 2016}} [[Flag of Romania|Romania]] and [[Flag of Mexico|Mexico]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n* The [[Union Flag]] (Union Jack) of the [[United Kingdom]] is the most commonly used. British colonies typically flew a flag based on one of the ensigns based on this flag, and many former colonies have retained the design to acknowledge their cultural history. Examples: [[Flag of Australia|Australia]], [[Flag of Fiji|Fiji]], [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Flag of Tuvalu|Tuvalu]], and also the Canadian provinces of [[Flag of Manitoba|Manitoba]], [[Flag of Ontario|Ontario]] and [[Flag of British Columbia|British Columbia]], and the American state of [[Flag of Hawaii|Hawaii]]; ''see [[commons:Flags based on British ensigns]]''.\n* The [[flag of the United States]] is nicknamed ''The Stars and Stripes'' or ''Old Glory''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-the-United-States-of-America|title=Flag of the United States of America|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> Some nations imitated this flag so as to symbolise their similarity to the United States and/or the [[American Revolution]].

Accordingly, its [[Flag of Ethiopia|flag]] became the source of the [[Pan-African colours]], or 'Rasta colours'. Examples: [[Flag of Benin|Benin]], [[Flag of Togo|Togo]], [[Flag of Senegal|Senegal]], [[Flag of Ghana|Ghana]], [[Flag of Mali|Mali]], [[Flag of Guinea|Guinea]].\n* The [[flag of Turkey]], which is very similar to the last flag of the old [[Ottoman Empire]], has been an inspiration for the flag designs of many other Muslim nations. During the time of the Ottomans the [[crescent]] began to be associated with [[Islam]] and this is reflected on the flags of [[Flag of Algeria|Algeria]], [[Flag of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], [[Flag of Comoros|Comoros]], [[Flag of Libya|Libya]], [[Flag of Mauritania|Mauritania]], [[Flag of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Flag of Tunisia|Tunisia]] and [[Flag of Maldives|Maldives]]\n* The [[Pan-Arab colours]], green, white, red and black, are derived from the flag of the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab Revolt]] as seen on the flags of [[Flag of Jordan|Jordan]], [[Flag of Libya|Libya]], [[Flag of Kuwait|Kuwait]], [[Flag of Sudan|Sudan]], [[Flag of Syria|Syria]], the [[Flag of United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], [[Flag of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|Western Sahara]], [[Flag of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Flag of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Flag of Yemen|Yemen]] and [[Palestinian flag|Palestine]].\n* The [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]], with its golden symbols of the [[hammer and sickle]] on a red field, was an inspiration to flags of other [[communism|communist]] states, such as [[Flag of East Germany|East Germany]], [[Flag of the People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China]], [[Flag of Vietnam|Vietnam]], [[Flag of Angola|Angola]], [[Flag of Afghanistan|Afghanistan (1978\u20131980)]] and [[Flag of Mozambique|Mozambique]].\n* The [[flag of Venezuela]], created by [[Francisco de Miranda]] to represent the independence movement in Venezuela that later gave birth to the [[Republic of Gran Colombia|\"Gran Colombia\"]], inspired the flags of [[Flag of Colombia|Colombia]], [[Flag of Ecuador|Ecuador]], and [[Flag of the Federal Territory (Malaysia)|the Federal Territories in Malaysia]], all sharing three bands of yellow, blue and red with the flag of Venezuela.\n* The [[flag of Argentina]], created by [[Manuel Belgrano]] during the war of independence, was the inspiration for the [[United Provinces of Central America]]'s flag, which in turn was the origin for the flags of [[Flag of Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Flag of Honduras|Honduras]], [[Flag of El Salvador|El Salvador]], and [[Flag of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]].\n\nNational flag designs are often used to signify nationality in other forms, such as [[flag patch]]es.\n\n===Civil flags===\n{{Main|Civil flag}}\nA ''civil'' flag is a version of the national flag that is flown by civilians on non-government installations or craft. The use of civil flags was more common in the past, in order to denote buildings or ships that were not manned by the military. In some countries the civil flag is the same as the [[war flag]] or [[state flag]], but without the coat of arms, such as in the case of [[Flag of Spain|Spain]], and in others it's an alteration of the war flag.\n\n===War flags===\n{{Main|War flag|Colours, standards and guidons}}\n[[File:Ensign of the Royal Air Force.svg|thumb|Standard for the [[UK]]'s [[Royal Air Force]], the [[Royal Air Force Ensign|Ensign of the RAF]] displays the RAF [[roundel]] that is also  displayed on the fuselage and wings of British warplanes.]]\n\nSeveral countries, including the [[British Army]] and the  [[Royal Navy]] ([[White Ensign]]) of the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Great Britain]]) and the [[Soviet Union]] have had [[Union Jack|unique flags]] flown by their [[armed forces]] separately, rather than the [[national flag]].\n\nOther countries' armed forces (such as those of the [[United States]] or [[Switzerland]]) use their standard [[Flag of the United States|national flag]], in addition, the  U.S. has alongside flags and seals designed from long tradition for each of its six uniformed military services/military sub-departments in the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]. The [[Philippines]]' armed forces may use their [[Flag of the Philippines|standard national flag]], but during times of war the flag is turned upside down. [[Flag of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]'s flag is also turned upside down during times of war. These are also considered war flags, though the terminology only applies to the flag's military usage.\n\nLarge versions of the war flag flown on the [[warship]]s of countries' [[navy|navies]] are known as [[battle ensign]]s. In addition besides flying the national standard or a military services' emblem flag at a military fort, base, station or post and at sea at the stern (rear) or main top mast of a warship, a [[Jack (flag)|Naval Jack flag]] and other [[Maritime flag]]s, [[Pennant (commissioning)|pennants]] and emblems are flown at the bow (front). In times of war waving a white flag is a banner of truce, talks/negotiations or surrender.\n\nFour distinctive [[Africa]]n flags currently in the collection of the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] were flown in action by [[Itsekiri]] ships under the control of [[Nana Olomu]] during the conflict in the late 19th century. One is the flag generally known as the [[Flag of the Benin Empire|Benin Empire flag]] and one is referred to as Nana Olomu's flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rog.nmm.ac.uk/upload/amaxus_pdf/amaxus_conWebDoc_229.pdf|title=Welcome to the Royal Museums Greenwich Blogs - Royal Museums Greenwich Blogs|access-date=2010-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928144651/http://www.rog.nmm.ac.uk/upload/amaxus_pdf/amaxus_conWebDoc_229.pdf|archive-date=2011-09-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|The [[Flag of the United Nations]], sky blue field with north polar view looking down on a world map in white with two olive branches wreaths curved around.

A national flag flown at sea is known as an [[ensign]]. A courteous, peaceable [[merchant navy|merchant ship]] or [[yacht]] customarily flies its ensign (in the usual ensign position), together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast (known as a [[courtesy flag]]). To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or in the face of a foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with [[cannon]], for the right to do so. As of 2009, this custom is still taken seriously by many naval and port authorities and is readily enforced in many parts of the world by boarding, confiscation and other civil penalties. In some countries [[yacht ensign]]s are different from merchant ensigns in order to signal that the yacht is not carrying [[cargo]] that requires a [[customs]] declaration. Carrying commercial cargo on a boat with a yacht ensign is deemed to be [[smuggling]] in many jurisdictions. Traditionally, a vessel flying under the courtesy flag of a specific nation, regardless of the vessel's country of registry, is considered to be operating under the law of her 'host' nation.\n\n[[File:ICS Delta.svg|thumb|The international maritime signal flag ''Delta'' (letter ''D'')]]\nThere is a system of [[international maritime signal flags]] for numerals and letters of the alphabet. Each flag or pennant has a specific meaning when flown individually. As well, [[Flag semaphore|semaphore flags]] can be used to communicate on an ''ad hoc'' basis from ship to ship over short distances.\n\nAnother category of maritime flag flown by some [[United States Government]] ships is the [[distinguishing mark]]. Although the [[United States Coast Guard]] has its own service ensign, all other U.S. Government ships fly the national ensign their service ensign, following [[United States Navy]] practice. To distinguish themselves from ships of the Navy, such ships historically have flown their parent organisation's flag from a forward mast as a distinguishing mark. Today, for example, commissioned ships of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) fly the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration#Flag|NOAA flag]] as a distinguishing mark.\n\n==Shapes and designs==\n[[File:Flag of Ohio.svg|thumb|left|The Ohio burgee]]\n[[File:Flag of Nepal.svg|thumb|The [[flag of Nepal]], a national flag that is not rectangular.]]\n[[File:Flag of Kiribati.svg|thumb|The [[flag of Kiribati]], a [[banner of arms]] ]]\nFlags are usually rectangular in shape (often in the ratio 2:3, 1:2, or 3:5), but may be of any shape or size that is practical for flying, including square, triangular, or swallow tailed. A more unusual flag shape is that of the [[flag of Nepal]], which is in the shape of two stacked triangles. Other unusually shaped flags include the civil flags of [[Flag of Ohio|Ohio]] (a [[Swallowtail (flag)|swallowtail]]); [[Flag of Tampa, Florida|Tampa, Florida]]; and [[Pike County, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pike|work=County Flags|publisher=[[Ohio Statehouse]] Museum|location=Columbus, Ohio|accessdate=July 20, 2019|url=http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/museum/county-flags/pike}}</ref>\n\nMany flags are dyed [[through and through]] to be inexpensive to manufacture, such that the reverse side is the [[mirror image]] of the [[obverse]] (front) side, generally the side displayed when, from the observer's point of view, the flag flies from pole-side left to right. This presents two possibilities:\n\n# If the design is [[symmetric]]al in an axis parallel to the flag pole, obverse and reverse will be identical despite the mirror-reversal, such as the [[flag of India|Indian Flag]] or [[Flag of Canada|Canadian Flag]]\n# If not, the obverse and reverse will present two variants of the same design, one with the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|hoist]] on the left (usually considered the obverse side), the other with the hoist on the right (usually considered the reverse side of the flag). This is very common and usually not disturbing if there is no text in the design.\n\nSome complex flag designs are not intended to be shown on both sides, requiring separate obverse and reverse sides if made correctly. In these cases there is a design element (usually text) which is not symmetric and should be read in the same direction, regardless of whether the hoist is to the viewer's left or right. These cases can be divided into two types:\n\n# The same (asymmetric) design may be duplicated on both sides. Such flags can be manufactured by creating two identical through and through flags and then sewing them back to back, though this can affect the resulting combination's responsiveness to the wind. Depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol [[File:IFIS Equal.svg]], indicating the reverse is congruent to (rather than a mirror image of) the obverse.\n# Rarely, the reverse design may differ, in whole or in part, from that of the obverse. Examples of [[flags whose reverse differs from the obverse]] include the [[flag of Paraguay]], the [[flag of Oregon]], and the historical [[flag of the Soviet Union]]. Depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol [[File:IFIS Two-sided.svg]].\n\n<!--removed pending Guinness verification of the May 2010 Moroccan flag\n{{flag image|Image = Israelisuperflag.jpg|Caption = The largest flag in the world, a [[flag of Israel]]}}\n/-->\nCommon designs on flags include crosses, stripes, and divisions of the surface, or ''field'', into bands or quarters\u2014patterns and principles mainly derived from [[heraldry]]. A heraldic coat of arms may also be flown as a [[Banner#Heraldic banners|banner of arms]], as is done on both the state [[flag of Maryland]] and the [[flag of Kiribati]].\n\nThe ''de jure'' [[flag of Libya]] under [[Muammar Gaddafi]], which consisted of a rectangular field of green, was for a long period the only national flag using a single colour and no design or insignia. However, other historical states have also used flags without designs or insignia, such as the short-lived [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Soviet Republic of Hungary]] and the more recent [[Muscat and Oman|Sultanate of Muscat and Oman]], whose flags were both a plain field of red.\n\nColours are normally described with common names, such as \"red\", but may be further specified using [[colorimetry|colourimetry]].\n\nThe largest flag flown from a flagpole worldwide, according to Guinness World Records, is the [[flag of Mexico]] flown in [[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]], [[Mexico]].

In [[Buddhism]], [[prayer flags]] are used, usually in sets of five differently coloured flags. Several flags and banners including the [[Black Standard]] are [[Islamic flags|associated with Islam]]. Many [[religion in national flags|national flags]] and other flags include religious symbols such as the cross, the crescent, or a reference to a patron saint. Flags are also adopted by religious groups and flags such as the [[Jain flag]], [[Nishan Sahib]] ([[Sikhism]]), the [[Saffron Flag]] ([[Hindu]])and the [[Christian flag]] are used to represent a whole religion.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Pro2.2.jpg|Poland (Gorz\u00f3w Wlkp.).

Examples of such use include:\n\n* representing language skills of an individual, like a staff member of a company\n* displaying available languages on a multilingual website or software.\nThough this can be done in an uncontroversial manner in some cases, this can easily lead to some problems for certain languages:\n* languages generating [[language secessionism]], such as [[Serbo-Croatian]] which since the [[break-up of Yugoslavia]] in 1991, has lost its unitary codification and its official unitary status and is now divided into four official languages: [[Croatian language]], [[Bosnian language]], [[Serbian language]] and the [[Montenegrin language]]\n* languages spoken in [[World language|more than one country]], such as English or Arabic.\nIn this second case, common solutions include symbolising these languages by:\n* the flag of the country where the language originated\n* the flag of the country having the largest number of native speakers\n* a mixed flag of the both (when this is not the same)\n* the flag of the country most identified with that language in a specific region (e.g. Portuguese Language: Flag of Portugal in Europe and Flag of Brazil in South America). A Portugal-Brazil mixed flag, usually divided diagonally, is also a possibility.\n\nThus, on the Internet, it is common to see the English language associated with the [[flag of the United Kingdom]], or sometimes the [[flag of England]], the [[flag of the United States]] or a U.S.-UK mixed flag, usually divided diagonally.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Flag of La Francophonie.svg|Flag of La [[Francophonie]]\nFile:Flag of the Hispanicity.svg|Flag of [[Hispanidad|Hispanicity]]\nFile:Flag of Esperanto.svg|Flag of [[Esperanto]]\nFile:Lojban flag.svg|Flag of [[Lojban]]\n</gallery>\n<!-- Commented out: File:Flag of the CPLP.svg|Flag of [[CPLP]] (Lusophone Community) -->\n\n==Related flags==\nSince many flags have a simple design, there is bound to be cases of flags with similar designs.

Officials called ''touch judges'' use flags for similar purposes in both codes of [[Rugby football|rugby]].\n* In [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]], [[referee]]s use [[penalty flag]]s to indicate that a foul has been committed in game play. The phrase used for such an indication is ''flag on the play''. The flag itself is a small, weighted handkerchief, tossed on the field at the approximate point of the infraction; the intent is usually to sort out the details after the current play from scrimmage has concluded. In American football, the flag is usually yellow; in Canadian football, it is usually orange.  In the [[National Football League]], coaches also use red challenge flags to indicate that they wish to contest a ruling on the field.\n* In [[yacht racing]], flags are used to communicate information from the race committee boat to the racers. Different flags hoisted from the committee boat may communicate a false start, changes in the course, a cancelled race, or other important information. Racing boats themselves may also use flags to symbolise a protest or distress. The flags are often part of the nautical alphabetic system of [[International maritime signal flags]], in which 26 different flags designate the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet.\n[[File:Auto Racing Chequered.svg|thumb|Flags flown at a [[auto racing|car race]] ]]\n* In [[auto racing|auto]] and [[Motorcycle sport|motorcycle racing]], [[racing flags]] are used to communicate with drivers. Most famously, a checkered flag of black and white squares indicates the end of the race, and victory for the leader. A yellow flag is used to indicate caution requiring slow speed and a red flag requires racers to stop immediately. A black flag is used to indicate penalties.\n\n:{{Main|Racing flags}}\n* In addition, fans of almost all sports wave flags in the stands to indicate their support for the participants. Many sports teams have their own flags, and, in individual sports, fans will indicate their support for a player by waving the flag of his or her home country.\n* [[Capture the flag]] is a popular children's sport.\n* In [[Gaelic football]] and [[Hurling]] a green flag is used to indicate a goal while a white flag is used to indicate a point\n* In [[Australian rules football]], the [[Umpire (Australian rules football)|goal umpire]] will wave two flags to indicate a goal (worth six points) and a single flag to indicate a behind (worth one point).\n* For safety, [[Glossary of underwater diving terminology|dive flags]] indicate the locations of underwater [[SCUBA diving|scuba divers]] or that diving operations are being conducted in the vicinity.\n* In water sports such as wakeboarding and Water-Skiing, an orange flag is held in between runs to indicate someone is in the water.\n* In [[golf]], the hole is almost always marked with a flag. The flagpole is designed to fit centered within the base of the hole and is removable.  Many courses will use colour-coded flags to determine a hole location at the front, middle or rear of the green.  However colour-coded flags are not used in the professional tours. (A rare example of a golf course that does not use flags to mark the hole is the East Course of [[Merion Golf Club]], which instead uses flagpoles topped by [[Merion Golf Club#Wicker baskets|wicker baskets]].)\n* Flag poles with flags of all shapes and sizes are used by marching bands, drum corps, and winter guard teams use flags as a method of visual enhancement in performances.\n\n==Diplomatic flags==\n{{Main|Diplomatic flag}}\nSome countries use diplomatic flags, such as the [[United Kingdom]] <!--([[List of British flags#Diplomatic flags]])-->(see [[:File:British Ambassador Ensign.svg|Image of the Embassy flag]]) and the Kingdom of [[Thailand]] <!--([[List of Thai flags#Diplomatic flags]])-->(see [[:File:Embassador Flag of Thailand.svg|Image of the Embassy flag]]).\n\nThe [[Socialism|socialist]] movement uses [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]]s to represent their cause. The [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movement has a variety of different flags, but the primary flag associated with them is the [[Anarchist symbolism#Black flag|black flag]]. In the [[Spanish civil war]], the anarchists used the red-and-black bisected flag. In the 20th century, the [[Rainbow flag (gay movement)|rainbow flag]] was adopted as a symbol of the [[LGBT social movements]]. Its derivatives include the [[Bisexual pride flag|Bisexual pride]] and [[Transgender pride flag]]s.\n\nSome of these political flags have become national flags, such as the red flag of the [[Soviet Union]] and national socialist banners for [[Nazi Germany]]. The present [[Flag of Portugal]] is based on what had been the political flag of the [[Portuguese Republican Party]] previous to the [[5 October 1910 revolution]] which brought this party to power.\n\n==Disability flags==\nSome disability advocacy groups have adopted flags to raise awareness of their causes.\n\nThe Epilepsy Awareness Flag includes a prominent [[lowercase]] letter 'e' on a white background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epilepsystore.com/product/epilepsy-awareness-flag/|title=Epilepsy Awareness Flag - EpilepsyStore.com|author=|date=|work=EpilepsyStore.com|access-date=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen the World Federation of the Deaf adopted its own flag,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wfdeaf.org/news/article-5-aims/|title=Article 5 - Flag - WFD|author=|date=28 April 2011|work=WFDeaf.org|access-date=31 March 2017}}</ref> this action caused some controversy within the [[deaf]] community due to the popularity of another flag which was already being flown by many deaf people and related organisations.\n\n==Vehicle flags==\nFlags are often representative of an individual's affinity or allegiance to a country, team or business and can be presented in various ways. A popular trend that has surfaced revolves around the idea of the 'mobile' flag in which an individual displays their particular flag of choice on their vehicle. These items are commonly referred to as car flags and are usually manufactured from high strength polyester material and are attached to a vehicle via a polypropylene pole and clip window attachment.\n\n==Swimming flags==\n[[File:Flags - swim between the.png|thumb|Open swimming area]]\n[[File:Flags crossed - do not swim.png|thumb|Closed swimming area]]\n[[File:Red flag at beach.jpg|thumb|upright|Red flag at a beach in Ireland, indicating that the water is not safe for swimming]]\nIn [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Philippines]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], a pair of red-yellow flags is used to mark the limits of the bathing area on a beach, usually guarded by [[surf lifesaving|surf lifesavers]]. If the beach is closed, the poles of the flags are crossed. The flags are coloured with a red triangle and a yellow triangle making a rectangular flag, or a red rectangle over a yellow rectangle. On many Australian beaches there is a slight variation with beach condition signalling. A red flag signifies a closed beach (in the UK also other dangers), yellow signifies strong current or difficult swimming conditions, and green represents a beach safe for general swimming. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], a red and yellow flag indicates that it is safe to swim; a red flag that it is unsafe; and no flag indicates that there are no lifeguards on duty. Blue flags may also be used away from the yellow-red lifesaver area to designate a zone for surfboarding and other small, non-motorised watercraft.\n\nReasons for closing the beach include:\n* [[dangerous rip]]\n* [[hurricane]] warning\n* no [[lifeguard]]s in attendance\n* [[pollution|overpolluted]] water\n* [[shark]]s\n* [[tsunami]]\n* [[wave]]s too strong\n\nA surf flag exists, divided into four quadrants. The top left and bottom right quadrants are black, and the remaining area is white.\n\n[[International maritime signal flags|Signal flag]] \"India\" (a black circle on a yellow square) is frequently used to denote a \"blackball\" zone where surfboards cannot be used but other water activities are permitted.\n\n==Railway flags==\nRailways use a number of coloured flags. When used as wayside signals they usually use the following meanings (exact meanings are set by the individual railroad company):\n\n* red = stop\n* yellow = proceed with care\n* green or white = proceed.\n* a flag of any colour waved vigorously means stop\n* a blue flag on the side of a locomotive means that it should not be moved because someone is working on it (or on the train attached to it). A blue flag on a track means that nothing on that track should be moved. The flag can only be removed by the person or group that placed it. In the railway dominated steel industry this principle of \"blue flag and tag\" was extended to all operations at Bethlehem Steel, [[Lackawanna, New York]]. If a man went inside a large machine or worked on an electrical circuit for example, his blue flag and tag was sacrosanct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oshrc.gov/decisions/html_1990/79-2597.html|title=Docket No. 79-2597|access-date=2010-06-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527155228/http://www.oshrc.gov/decisions/html_1990/79-2597.html|archive-date=2010-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The \"[[Lockout-tagout|Lock Out/Tag Out]]\" practice is similar and now used in other industries to comply with safety regulations.\n\nAt night, the flags are replaced with lanterns showing the same colours.\n\nFlags displayed on the front of a moving locomotive are an acceptable replacement for classification lights and usually have the following meanings (exact meanings are set by the individual railroad company):\n\n* white = extra (not on the timetable)\n* green = another section following\n* red = last section\n\nAdditionally, a railroad brakeman will typically carry a red flag to make his or her hand signals more visible to the engineer.

If it is taller than can be easily reached to raise the flag, a cord is used, looping around a pulley at the top of the pole with the ends tied at the bottom. The flag is fixed to one lower end of the cord, and is then raised by pulling on the other end. The cord is then tightened and tied to the pole at the bottom. The pole is usually topped by a flat plate or ball called a \"[[Truck (rigging)|truck]]\" (originally meant to keep a wooden pole from splitting) or a [[finial]] in a more complex shape. Very high flagpoles may require more complex support structures than a simple pole, such as a [[guyed mast]].\n\n[[Dwajasthambam]] are flagpoles commonly found at the entrances of [[South India]]n [[Hindu temple]]s.<ref>[[Alf Hiltebeitel|Hiltebeitel, Alf]] (1991).

Raising or lowering flags, especially national flags, usually involves ceremonies and certain sets of rules, depending on the country, and usually involve the performance of a [[national anthem]].\n\nA flag-raising squad is a group of people, usually troops, cadets, or students, that march in and bring the flags for the flag-hoisting ceremony. Flag-hoisting ceremonies involving flag-raising squads can be simple or elaborate, involving large numbers of squads. Elaborate flag-hoisting ceremonies are usually performed on national holidays.\n\nThe cord or rope that ties a flag to its pole is called a halyard. Flags may have a strip of fabric along the hoist side called a ''heading'' for the halyard to pass through, or a pair of [[grommet]]s for the halyard to be threaded through. Flags may also be held in position using [[Inglefield clip]]s.<ref>Inglefield, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Flags in communication==\n[[File:Semaphore Signals A-Z.jpg|thumb|right|Semaphore signals for the letters of the English alphabet]]\n[[Flag semaphore|Semaphore]] is a form of communication that utilises flags. The signalling is performed by an individual using two flags (or lighted wands), the positions of the flags indicating a symbol. The person who holds the flags is known as the signalman. This form of communication is primarily used by [[navy|naval]] signallers. This technique of signalling was adopted in the early 19th century and is still used in various forms today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/flags/semaphore.html|title=Semaphore Flag Signalling System|author=|date=|work=ANBG.gov.au|access-date=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe colours of the flags can also be used to communicate. For example; a white flag means, among other things, surrender or peace, a red flag can be used as a warning signal, and a black flag can mean war, or determination to defeat enemies.\n\nOrientation of a flag is also used for communication, though the practice is rarely used given modern communication systems. Raising a flag upside-down was indicative that the raising force controlled that particular area, but that it was in severe distress.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.military.com/flag-day/flag-ettiquette-dos-and-donts.html|title=Flag Etiquette Do's and Don'ts|last=Scanlon|first=Caitlin|work=Military.com|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Flapping==\n[[File:Memphis_Tigers_Flag_video_2011-02-20.theora.ogv|thumb|Video of flag flapping]]\nWhen blown by the wind, flags are subject to wave-like motions that grow in amplitude along the length of the flag.

It is used as a [[symbol]], a signalling device, or for decoration. The term ''flag'' is also used to refer to the [[graphic design]] employed, and flags have evolved into a general tool for rudimentary signalling and identification, especially in environments where communication is challenging (such as the [[Maritime flag|maritime environment]], where [[Flag semaphore|semaphore]] is used). The study of flags is known as \"[[vexillology]]\" from the [[Latin]] ''vexillum'', meaning \"flag\" or \"[[banner]]\".\n\n[[National flag]]s are [[patriotic]] symbols with widely varied interpretations that often include strong [[military]] associations because of their original and ongoing use for that purpose. Flags are also used in [[messaging]], [[advertising]], or for [[decorative]] purposes.\n\nSome military units are called \"flags\" after their use of flags. A ''flag'' (Arabic: \u0644\u0648\u0627\u0621) is equivalent to a [[brigade]] in Arab countries. In Spain, a ''flag'' (Spanish: ''bandera'') is a [[battalion]]-equivalent in the [[Spanish Legion]].\n\n==History==\n{{Further|Vexilloid|Heraldic flag|Royal Standard}}\n[[File:Bronze flag, Shadad Kerman, Iran.JPG|upright|thumb|right|Bronze flag found in [[Shahdad]], [[Iran]], 3rd millennium BC]]\nThe origin of the flag is unknown.<ref>Inglefield, p. 39.</ref> In antiquity, [[field sign]]s or standards were used in warfare that can be categorised as [[vexilloid]] or 'flag-like'. This originated in [[ancient Egypt]] or [[Assyria]].<ref name=\"Britannica\">[https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-heraldry Flag | heraldry]. ''Encyclopedia Britannica''. Retrieved February 15, 2019.</ref> Examples include the [[Sassanid]] battle standard [[Derafsh Kaviani]], and the standards of the [[Roman legion]]s such as the [[aquila (Roman)|eagle]] of [[Augustus Caesar]]'s [[Legio X Fretensis|Xth legion]], or the [[Draconarius|dragon standard]] of the [[Sarmatians]]; the latter was let fly freely in the wind, carried by a horseman, but judging from depictions it was more similar to an elongated [[dragon kite]] than to a simple flag.\n\nFlags as recognized today, made of a piece of cloth representing a particular entity, were invented in the [[Indian subcontinent]] or [[ancient China|Chinese]] [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046-256 BCE). Chinese flags depicted colorful animals and royal flags were to be treated with a similar level of respect attributed to the ruler. Indian flags were often triangular and decorated with attachments such as [[yak]]'s tail and the state umbrella. These usages spread to [[Southeast Asia]] as well, and were transmitted to Europe through the [[Muslim world]] where plainly colored flags were being used due to [[Aniconism in Islam|Islamic proscriptions]].<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nIn [[Europe]], during the [[High Middle Ages]], flags came to be used primarily as a [[heraldic flag|heraldic device]] in battle, allowing more easily to identify a knight than only from the heraldic device painted on the shield. Already during the high medieval period, and increasingly during the [[Late Middle Ages]], [[city state]]s and [[medieval commune|communes]] such as those of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]] also began to use flags as field signs. Regimental flags for individual units became commonplace during the [[Early Modern period]].\n\n[[File:Sujagi (1871).jpg|upright|left|thumb|''[[Sujagi]]'' of [[Eo Jae-yeon]], captured in 1871]]\n\nDuring the peak of the [[age of sail]], beginning in the early 17th century, it was customary (and later a legal requirement) for ships to carry flags designating their nationality;<ref>Articles 90\u201394 of the [[UN Convention on the Law of the Sea]]</ref> these flags eventually evolved into the national flags and [[maritime flags]] of today. Flags also became the preferred means of [[communication]]s at sea, resulting in various systems of flag signals; ''see, [[International maritime signal flags]]''.\n\nUse of flags outside of military or naval context begins only with the rise of [[nationalism|nationalist]] sentiment by the end of the 18th century, although some flags date back earlier. The flags of countries such as Austria, Denmark or Turkey emerged from the midst of legend while many others, including those of Poland and Switzerland, grew out of the heraldic emblems of the Middle Ages. The 17th century saw the birth of several [[national flag]]s through revolutionary struggle. One of these was the flag of the Netherlands, which appeared during the 80-year Dutch rebellion which began in 1568 against Spanish domination.<ref>Inglefield, p. 48.</ref>\n\nPolitical change and social reform, allied to a growing sense of nationhood among ordinary people, led to the birth of new nations and flags all over the world in the 19th and 20th centuries.<ref>Inglefield, p. 50.</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n==National flags==\n{{Main|National flag}}\n[[File:Flags at half-staff outside Central Plaza.jpg|thumb|Flags at [[half-mast]] outside [[Central Plaza, Hong Kong]], after the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]].

An earlier use of the white cross on red is attested by an armorial (Netherlands) of 1370-1386. In later monastic tradition, the Danneborg made its first, miraculous appearance at the Battle of Lindanise on 15 June 1219.</ref>\n* The [[flag of the Netherlands]] is the oldest [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]]. Its three colours of red, white and blue go back to [[Charlemagne]]'s time, the 9th century. The coastal region of what today is the Netherlands was then known for its cloth in these colours. Maps from the early 16th century already put flags in these colours next to this region, like Texeira's map of 1520. A century before that, during the 15th century, the three colours were mentioned as the coastal signals for this area, with the three bands straight or diagonal, single or doubled. As [[state flag]] it first appeared around 1572 as the [[Prince's Flag]] in orange\u2013white\u2013blue. Soon the more famous red\u2013white\u2013blue began appearing, becoming the prevalent version from around 1630. Orange made a comeback during the civil war of the late 18th century, signifying the orangist or pro-[[stadtholder]] party. During World War II the pro-Nazi [[National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands|NSB]] used it. Any symbolism has been added later to the three colours, although the orange comes from the [[House of Orange-Nassau]]. This use of orange comes from Nassau, which today uses orange-blue, not from Orange, which today uses red-blue. However, the usual way to show the link with the House of Orange-Nassau is the orange pennant above the red-white-blue.  It is said that the Dutch Tricolour has inspired<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-France|title=flag of France {{!}} History & Meaning|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-02-24}}</ref>{{Citation needed |date=October 2007}} many flags but most notably those of [[Russia]], [[New York City]], and [[South Africa]] (the 1928\u201394 flag as well the current flag).  As the probable inspiration for the Russian flag, it is the source too for the [[Pan-Slavic colours]] red, white and blue, adopted by many [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] states and peoples as their symbols; examples are [[Flag of Slovakia|Slovakia]], [[Flag of Serbia|Serbia]], and [[Flag of Slovenia|Slovenia]].\n* The national [[flag of France]] was designed in 1794. As a forerunner of revolution, France's tricolour flag style has been adopted by other nations. Examples: [[Flag of Italy|Italy]], [[flag of Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], [[flag of Dominican Republic|Dominican Republic]], [[Flag of Ireland|Ireland]], [[flag of Haiti|Haiti]],{{Citation needed|reason=The flag of Haiti is a bicolour flag blazed with its coat of arms, seemingly unrelated to the French Tricolore.|date=October 2016}} [[Flag of Romania|Romania]] and [[Flag of Mexico|Mexico]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}\n* The [[Union Flag]] (Union Jack) of the [[United Kingdom]] is the most commonly used. British colonies typically flew a flag based on one of the ensigns based on this flag, and many former colonies have retained the design to acknowledge their cultural history. Examples: [[Flag of Australia|Australia]], [[Flag of Fiji|Fiji]], [[Flag of New Zealand|New Zealand]], [[Flag of Tuvalu|Tuvalu]], and also the Canadian provinces of [[Flag of Manitoba|Manitoba]], [[Flag of Ontario|Ontario]] and [[Flag of British Columbia|British Columbia]], and the American state of [[Flag of Hawaii|Hawaii]]; ''see [[commons:Flags based on British ensigns]]''.\n* The [[flag of the United States]] is nicknamed ''The Stars and Stripes'' or ''Old Glory''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/flag-of-the-United-States-of-America|title=Flag of the United States of America|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-05-24}}</ref> Some nations imitated this flag so as to symbolise their similarity to the United States and/or the [[American Revolution]].

Accordingly, its [[Flag of Ethiopia|flag]] became the source of the [[Pan-African colours]], or 'Rasta colours'. Examples: [[Flag of Benin|Benin]], [[Flag of Togo|Togo]], [[Flag of Senegal|Senegal]], [[Flag of Ghana|Ghana]], [[Flag of Mali|Mali]], [[Flag of Guinea|Guinea]].\n* The [[flag of Turkey]], which is very similar to the last flag of the old [[Ottoman Empire]], has been an inspiration for the flag designs of many other Muslim nations. During the time of the Ottomans the [[crescent]] began to be associated with [[Islam]] and this is reflected on the flags of [[Flag of Algeria|Algeria]], [[Flag of Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]], [[Flag of Comoros|Comoros]], [[Flag of Libya|Libya]], [[Flag of Mauritania|Mauritania]], [[Flag of Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Flag of Tunisia|Tunisia]] and [[Flag of Maldives|Maldives]]\n* The [[Pan-Arab colours]], green, white, red and black, are derived from the flag of the [[Arab Revolt|Great Arab Revolt]] as seen on the flags of [[Flag of Jordan|Jordan]], [[Flag of Libya|Libya]], [[Flag of Kuwait|Kuwait]], [[Flag of Sudan|Sudan]], [[Flag of Syria|Syria]], the [[Flag of United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], [[Flag of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic|Western Sahara]], [[Flag of Egypt|Egypt]], [[Flag of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Flag of Yemen|Yemen]] and [[Palestinian flag|Palestine]].\n* The [[Flag of the Soviet Union|Soviet flag]], with its golden symbols of the [[hammer and sickle]] on a red field, was an inspiration to flags of other [[communism|communist]] states, such as [[Flag of East Germany|East Germany]], [[Flag of the People's Republic of China|People's Republic of China]], [[Flag of Vietnam|Vietnam]], [[Flag of Angola|Angola]], [[Flag of Afghanistan|Afghanistan (1978\u20131980)]] and [[Flag of Mozambique|Mozambique]].\n* The [[flag of Venezuela]], created by [[Francisco de Miranda]] to represent the independence movement in Venezuela that later gave birth to the [[Republic of Gran Colombia|\"Gran Colombia\"]], inspired the flags of [[Flag of Colombia|Colombia]], [[Flag of Ecuador|Ecuador]], and [[Flag of the Federal Territory (Malaysia)|the Federal Territories in Malaysia]], all sharing three bands of yellow, blue and red with the flag of Venezuela.\n* The [[flag of Argentina]], created by [[Manuel Belgrano]] during the war of independence, was the inspiration for the [[United Provinces of Central America]]'s flag, which in turn was the origin for the flags of [[Flag of Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Flag of Honduras|Honduras]], [[Flag of El Salvador|El Salvador]], and [[Flag of Nicaragua|Nicaragua]].\n\nNational flag designs are often used to signify nationality in other forms, such as [[flag patch]]es.\n\n===Civil flags===\n{{Main|Civil flag}}\nA ''civil'' flag is a version of the national flag that is flown by civilians on non-government installations or craft. The use of civil flags was more common in the past, in order to denote buildings or ships that were not manned by the military. In some countries the civil flag is the same as the [[war flag]] or [[state flag]], but without the coat of arms, such as in the case of [[Flag of Spain|Spain]], and in others it's an alteration of the war flag.\n\n===War flags===\n{{Main|War flag|Colours, standards and guidons}}\n[[File:Ensign of the Royal Air Force.svg|thumb|Standard for the [[UK]]'s [[Royal Air Force]], the [[Royal Air Force Ensign|Ensign of the RAF]] displays the RAF [[roundel]] that is also  displayed on the fuselage and wings of British warplanes.]]\n\nSeveral countries, including the [[British Army]] and the  [[Royal Navy]] ([[White Ensign]]) of the [[United Kingdom]] ([[Great Britain]]) and the [[Soviet Union]] have had [[Union Jack|unique flags]] flown by their [[armed forces]] separately, rather than the [[national flag]].\n\nOther countries' armed forces (such as those of the [[United States]] or [[Switzerland]]) use their standard [[Flag of the United States|national flag]], in addition, the  U.S. has alongside flags and seals designed from long tradition for each of its six uniformed military services/military sub-departments in the [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] and the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]. The [[Philippines]]' armed forces may use their [[Flag of the Philippines|standard national flag]], but during times of war the flag is turned upside down. [[Flag of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]'s flag is also turned upside down during times of war. These are also considered war flags, though the terminology only applies to the flag's military usage.\n\nLarge versions of the war flag flown on the [[warship]]s of countries' [[navy|navies]] are known as [[battle ensign]]s. In addition besides flying the national standard or a military services' emblem flag at a military fort, base, station or post and at sea at the stern (rear) or main top mast of a warship, a [[Jack (flag)|Naval Jack flag]] and other [[Maritime flag]]s, [[Pennant (commissioning)|pennants]] and emblems are flown at the bow (front). In times of war waving a white flag is a banner of truce, talks/negotiations or surrender.\n\nFour distinctive [[Africa]]n flags currently in the collection of the [[National Maritime Museum]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] were flown in action by [[Itsekiri]] ships under the control of [[Nana Olomu]] during conflict in the late 19th century. One is the flag generally known as the [[Flag of the Benin Empire|Benin Empire flag]] and one is referred to as Nana Olomu's flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rog.nmm.ac.uk/upload/amaxus_pdf/amaxus_conWebDoc_229.pdf|title=Welcome to the Royal Museums Greenwich Blogs - Royal Museums Greenwich Blogs|access-date=2010-05-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928144651/http://www.rog.nmm.ac.uk/upload/amaxus_pdf/amaxus_conWebDoc_229.pdf|archive-date=2011-09-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|The [[Flag of the United Nations]], sky blue field with north polar view looking down on a world map in white with two olive branches wreaths curved around.

A national flag flown at sea is known as an [[ensign]]. A courteous, peaceable [[merchant navy|merchant ship]] or [[yacht]] customarily flies its ensign (in the usual ensign position), together with the flag of whatever nation it is currently visiting at the mast (known as a [[courtesy flag]]). To fly one's ensign alone in foreign waters, a foreign port or in the face of a foreign warship traditionally indicates a willingness to fight, with [[cannon]], for the right to do so. As of 2009, this custom is still taken seriously by many naval and port authorities and is readily enforced in many parts of the world by boarding, confiscation and other civil penalties. In some countries [[yacht ensign]]s are different from merchant ensigns in order to signal that the yacht is not carrying [[cargo]] that requires a [[customs]] declaration. Carrying commercial cargo on a boat with a yacht ensign is deemed to be [[smuggling]] in many jurisdictions. Traditionally, a vessel flying under the courtesy flag of a specific nation, regardless of the vessel's country of registry, is considered to be operating under the law of her 'host' nation.\n\n[[File:ICS Delta.svg|thumb|The international maritime signal flag ''Delta'' (letter ''D'')]]\nThere is a system of [[international maritime signal flags]] for numerals and letters of the alphabet. Each flag or pennant has a specific meaning when flown individually. As well, [[Flag semaphore|semaphore flags]] can be used to communicate on an ''ad hoc'' basis from ship to ship over short distances.\n\nAnother category of maritime flag flown by some [[United States Government]] ships is the [[distinguishing mark]]. Although the [[United States Coast Guard]] has its own service ensign, all other U.S. Government ships fly the national ensign their service ensign, following [[United States Navy]] practice. To distinguish themselves from ships of the Navy, such ships historically have flown their parent organisation's flag from a forward mast as a distinguishing mark. Today, for example, commissioned ships of the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA) fly the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration#Flag|NOAA flag]] as a distinguishing mark.\n\n==Shapes and designs==\n[[File:Flag of Ohio.svg|thumb|left|The Ohio burgee]]\n[[File:Flag of Nepal.svg|thumb|The [[flag of Nepal]], a national flag that is not rectangular.]]\n[[File:Flag of Kiribati.svg|thumb|The [[flag of Kiribati]], a [[banner of arms]] ]]\nFlags are usually rectangular in shape (often in the ratio 2:3, 1:2, or 3:5), but may be of any shape or size that is practical for flying, including square, triangular, or swallow tailed. A more unusual flag shape is that of the [[flag of Nepal]], which is in the shape of two stacked triangles. Other unusually shaped flags include the civil flags of [[Flag of Ohio|Ohio]] (a [[Swallowtail (flag)|swallowtail]]); [[Flag of Tampa, Florida|Tampa, Florida]]; and [[Pike County, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pike|work=County Flags|publisher=[[Ohio Statehouse]] Museum|location=Columbus, Ohio|accessdate=July 20, 2019|url=http://www.ohiostatehouse.org/museum/county-flags/pike}}</ref>\n\nMany flags are dyed [[through and through]] to be inexpensive to manufacture, such that the reverse side is the [[mirror image]] of the [[obverse]] (front) side, generally the side displayed when, from the observer's point of view, the flag flies from pole-side left to right. This presents two possibilities:\n\n# If the design is [[symmetric]]al in an axis parallel to the flag pole, obverse and reverse will be identical despite the mirror-reversal, such as the [[flag of India|Indian Flag]] or [[Flag of Canada|Canadian Flag]]\n# If not, the obverse and reverse will present two variants of the same design, one with the [[Flag terminology#Description of standard flag parts and terms|hoist]] on the left (usually considered the obverse side), the other with the hoist on the right (usually considered the reverse side of the flag). This is very common and usually not disturbing if there is no text in the design.\n\nSome complex flag designs are not intended to be shown on both sides, requiring separate obverse and reverse sides if made correctly. In these cases there is a design element (usually text) which is not symmetric and should be read in the same direction, regardless of whether the hoist is to the viewer's left or right. These cases can be divided into two types:\n\n# The same (asymmetric) design may be duplicated on both sides. Such flags can be manufactured by creating two identical through and through flags and then sewing them back to back, though this can affect the resulting combination's responsiveness to the wind. Depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol [[File:IFIS Equal.svg]], indicating the reverse is congruent to (rather than a mirror image of) the obverse.\n# Rarely, the reverse design may differ, in whole or in part, from that of the obverse. Examples of [[flags whose reverse differs from the obverse]] include the [[flag of Paraguay]], the [[flag of Oregon]], and the historical [[flag of the Soviet Union]]. Depictions of such flags may be marked with the symbol [[File:IFIS Two-sided.svg]].\n\n<!--removed pending Guinness verification of the May 2010 Moroccan flag\n{{flag image|Image = Israelisuperflag.jpg|Caption = The largest flag in the world, a [[flag of Israel]]}}\n/-->\nCommon designs on flags include crosses, stripes, and divisions of the surface, or ''field'', into bands or quarters\u2014patterns and principles mainly derived from [[heraldry]]. A heraldic coat of arms may also be flown as a [[Banner#Heraldic banners|banner of arms]], as is done on both the state [[flag of Maryland]] and the [[flag of Kiribati]].\n\nThe ''de jure'' [[flag of Libya]] under [[Muammar Gaddafi]], which consisted of a rectangular field of green, was for a long period the only national flag using a single colour and no design or insignia. However, other historical states have also used flags without designs or insignia, such as the short-lived [[Hungarian Soviet Republic|Soviet Republic of Hungary]] and the more recent [[Muscat and Oman|Sultanate of Muscat and Oman]], whose flags were both a plain field of red.\n\nColours are normally described with common names, such as \"red\", but may be further specified using [[colorimetry|colourimetry]].\n\nThe largest flag flown from a flagpole worldwide, according to Guinness World Records, is the [[flag of Mexico]] flown in [[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]], [[Mexico]].

Many [[religion in national flags|national flags]] and other flags include religious symbols such as the cross, the crescent, or a reference to a patron saint. Flags are also adopted by religious groups and flags such as the [[Jain flag]], [[Nishan Sahib]] ([[Sikhism]]), the [[Saffron Flag]] ([[Hindu]])and the [[Christian flag]] are used to represent a whole religion.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Pro2.2.jpg|Poland (Gorz\u00f3w Wlkp.).

A Portugal-Brazil mixed flag, usually divided diagonally, is also a possibility.\n\nThus, on the Internet, it is common to see the English language associated with the [[flag of the United Kingdom]], or sometimes the [[flag of England]], the [[flag of the United States]] or a U.S.-UK mixed flag, usually divided diagonally.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Flag of La Francophonie.svg|Flag of La [[Francophonie]]\nFile:Flag of the Hispanicity.svg|Flag of [[Hispanidad|Hispanicity]]\nFile:Flag of Esperanto.svg|Flag of [[Esperanto]]\nFile:Lojban flag.svg|Flag of [[Lojban]]\n</gallery>\n<!-- Commented out: File:Flag of the CPLP.svg|Flag of [[CPLP]] (Lusophone Community) -->\n\n==Related flags==\nSince many flags have a simple design, there is bound to be cases of flags with similar designs.

They use the flags to indicate to the [[Referee (Football)|referee]] potential infringements of the laws, or who is entitled to possession of the ball that has gone out of the field of play, or, most famously, raising the flag to indicate an [[offside (association football)|offside]] offence. Officials called ''touch judges'' use flags for similar purposes in both codes of [[Rugby football|rugby]].\n* In [[American football|American]] and [[Canadian football]], [[referee]]s use [[penalty flag]]s to indicate that a foul has been committed in game play. The phrase used for such an indication is ''flag on the play''. The flag itself is a small, weighted handkerchief, tossed on the field at the approximate point of the infraction; the intent is usually to sort out the details after the current play from scrimmage has concluded. In American football, the flag is usually yellow; in Canadian football, it is usually orange.  In the [[National Football League]], coaches also use red challenge flags to indicate that they wish to contest a ruling on the field.\n* In [[yacht racing]], flags are used to communicate information from the race committee boat to the racers. Different flags hoisted from the committee boat may communicate a false start, changes in the course, a cancelled race, or other important information. Racing boats themselves may also use flags to symbolise a protest or distress. The flags are often part of the nautical alphabetic system of [[International maritime signal flags]], in which 26 different flags designate the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet.\n[[File:Auto Racing Chequered.svg|thumb|Flags flown at a [[auto racing|car race]] ]]\n* In [[auto racing|auto]] and [[Motorcycle sport|motorcycle racing]], [[racing flags]] are used to communicate with drivers. Most famously, a checkered flag of black and white squares indicates the end of the race, and victory for the leader. A yellow flag is used to indicate caution requiring slow speed and a red flag requires racers to stop immediately. A black flag is used to indicate penalties.\n\n:{{Main|Racing flags}}\n* In addition, fans of almost all sports wave flags in the stands to indicate their support for the participants. Many sports teams have their own flags, and, in individual sports, fans will indicate their support for a player by waving the flag of his or her home country.\n* [[Capture the flag]] is a popular children's sport.\n* In [[Gaelic football]] and [[Hurling]] a green flag is used to indicate a goal while a white flag is used to indicate a point\n* In [[Australian rules football]], the [[Umpire (Australian rules football)|goal umpire]] will wave two flags to indicate a goal (worth six points) and a single flag to indicate a behind (worth one point).\n* For safety, [[Glossary of underwater diving terminology|dive flags]] indicate the locations of underwater [[SCUBA diving|scuba divers]] or that diving operations are being conducted in the vicinity.\n* In water sports such as wakeboarding and Water-Skiing, an orange flag is held in between runs to indicate someone is in the water.\n* In [[golf]], the hole is almost always marked with a flag. The flagpole is designed to fit centered within the base of the hole and is removable.  Many courses will use colour-coded flags to determine a hole location at the front, middle or rear of the green.  However colour-coded flags are not used in the professional tours. (A rare example of a golf course that does not use flags to mark the hole is the East Course of [[Merion Golf Club]], which instead uses flagpoles topped by [[Merion Golf Club#Wicker baskets|wicker baskets]].)\n* Flag poles with flags of all shapes and sizes are used by marching bands, drum corps, and winter guard teams use flags as a method of visual enhancement in performances.\n\n==Diplomatic flags==\n{{Main|Diplomatic flag}}\nSome countries use diplomatic flags, such as the [[United Kingdom]] <!--([[List of British flags#Diplomatic flags]])-->(see [[:File:British Ambassador Ensign.svg|Image of the Embassy flag]]) and the Kingdom of [[Thailand]] <!--([[List of Thai flags#Diplomatic flags]])-->(see [[:File:Embassador Flag of Thailand.svg|Image of the Embassy flag]]).\n\nThe [[Socialism|socialist]] movement uses [[Red flag (politics)|red flag]]s to represent their cause. The [[Anarchism|anarchist]] movement has a variety of different flags, but the primary flag associated with them is the [[Anarchist symbolism#Black flag|black flag]]. In the [[Spanish civil war]], the anarchists used the red-and-black bisected flag. In the 20th century, the [[Rainbow flag (gay movement)|rainbow flag]] was adopted as a symbol of the [[LGBT social movements]]. Its derivatives include the [[Bisexual pride flag|Bisexual pride]] and [[Transgender pride flag]]s.\n\nSome of these political flags have become national flags, such as the red flag of the [[Soviet Union]] and national socialist banners for [[Nazi Germany]]. The present [[Flag of Portugal]] is based on what had been the political flag of the [[Portuguese Republican Party]] previous to the [[5 October 1910 revolution]] which brought this party to power.\n\n==Disability flags==\nSome disability advocacy groups have adopted flags to raise awareness of their causes.\n\nThe Epilepsy Awareness Flag includes a prominent [[lowercase]] letter 'e' on a white background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://epilepsystore.com/product/epilepsy-awareness-flag/|title=Epilepsy Awareness Flag - EpilepsyStore.com|author=|date=|work=EpilepsyStore.com|access-date=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhen the World Federation of the Deaf adopted its own flag,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wfdeaf.org/news/article-5-aims/|title=Article 5 - Flag - WFD|author=|date=28 April 2011|work=WFDeaf.org|access-date=31 March 2017}}</ref> this action caused some controversy within the [[deaf]] community due to the popularity of another flag which was already being flown by many deaf people and related organisations.\n\n==Vehicle flags==\nFlags are often representative of an individual's affinity or allegiance to a country, team or business and can be presented in various ways. A popular trend that has surfaced revolves around the idea of the 'mobile' flag in which an individual displays their particular flag of choice on their vehicle. These items are commonly referred to as car flags and are usually manufactured from high strength polyester material and are attached to a vehicle via a polypropylene pole and clip window attachment.\n\n==Swimming flags==\n[[File:Flags - swim between the.png|thumb|Open swimming area]]\n[[File:Flags crossed - do not swim.png|thumb|Closed swimming area]]\n[[File:Red flag at beach.jpg|thumb|upright|Red flag at a beach in Ireland, indicating that the water is not safe for swimming]]\nIn [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], the [[Philippines]], [[Republic of Ireland]] and the [[United Kingdom]], a pair of red-yellow flags is used to mark the limits of the bathing area on a beach, usually guarded by [[surf lifesaving|surf lifesavers]]. If the beach is closed, the poles of the flags are crossed. The flags are coloured with a red triangle and a yellow triangle making a rectangular flag, or a red rectangle over a yellow rectangle. On many Australian beaches there is a slight variation with beach condition signalling. A red flag signifies a closed beach (in the UK also other dangers), yellow signifies strong current or difficult swimming conditions, and green represents a beach safe for general swimming. In [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], a red and yellow flag indicates that it is safe to swim; a red flag that it is unsafe; and no flag indicates that there are no lifeguards on duty. Blue flags may also be used away from the yellow-red lifesaver area to designate a zone for surfboarding and other small, non-motorised watercraft.\n\nReasons for closing the beach include:\n* [[dangerous rip]]\n* [[hurricane]] warning\n* no [[lifeguard]]s in attendance\n* [[pollution|overpolluted]] water\n* [[shark]]s\n* [[tsunami]]\n* [[wave]]s too strong\n\nA surf flag exists, divided into four quadrants. The top left and bottom right quadrants are black, and the remaining area is white.\n\n[[International maritime signal flags|Signal flag]] \"India\" (a black circle on a yellow square) is frequently used to denote a \"blackball\" zone where surfboards cannot be used but other water activities are permitted.\n\n==Railway flags==\nRailways use a number of coloured flags. When used as wayside signals they usually use the following meanings (exact meanings are set by the individual railroad company):\n\n* red = stop\n* yellow = proceed with care\n* green or white = proceed.\n* a flag of any colour waved vigorously means stop\n* a blue flag on the side of a locomotive means that it should not be moved because someone is working on it (or on the train attached to it). A blue flag on a track means that nothing on that track should be moved. The flag can only be removed by the person or group that placed it. In the railway dominated steel industry this principle of \"blue flag and tag\" was extended to all operations at Bethlehem Steel, [[Lackawanna, New York]]. If a man went inside a large machine or worked on an electrical circuit for example, his blue flag and tag was sacrosanct.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oshrc.gov/decisions/html_1990/79-2597.html|title=Docket No. 79-2597|access-date=2010-06-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527155228/http://www.oshrc.gov/decisions/html_1990/79-2597.html|archive-date=2010-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>  The \"[[Lockout-tagout|Lock Out/Tag Out]]\" practice is similar and now used in other industries to comply with safety regulations.\n\nAt night, the flags are replaced with lanterns showing the same colours.\n\nFlags displayed on the front of a moving locomotive are an acceptable replacement for classification lights and usually have the following meanings (exact meanings are set by the individual railroad company):\n\n* white = extra (not on the timetable)\n* green = another section following\n* red = last section\n\nAdditionally, a railroad brakeman will typically carry a red flag to make his or her hand signals more visible to the engineer.

If it is taller than can be easily reached to raise the flag, a cord is used, looping around a pulley at the top of the pole with the ends tied at the bottom. The flag is fixed to one lower end of the cord, and is then raised by pulling on the other end. The cord is then tightened and tied to the pole at the bottom. The pole is usually topped by a flat plate or ball called a \"[[Truck (rigging)|truck]]\" (originally meant to keep a wooden pole from splitting) or a [[finial]] in a more complex shape. Very high flagpoles may require more complex support structures than a simple pole, such as a [[guyed mast]].\n\n[[Dwajasthambam]] are flagpoles commonly found at the entrances of [[South India]]n [[Hindu temple]]s.<ref>[[Alf Hiltebeitel|Hiltebeitel, Alf]] (1991).

Raising or lowering flags, especially national flags, usually involves ceremonies and certain sets of rules, depending on the country, and usually involve the performance of a [[national anthem]].\n\nA flag-raising squad is a group of people, usually troops, cadets, or students, that march in and bring the flags for the flag-hoisting ceremony. Flag-hoisting ceremonies involving flag-raising squads can be simple or elaborate, involving large numbers of squads. Elaborate flag-hoisting ceremonies are usually performed on national holidays.\n\nThe cord or rope that ties a flag to its pole is called a halyard. Flags may have a strip of fabric along the hoist side called a ''heading'' for the halyard to pass through, or a pair of [[grommet]]s for the halyard to be threaded through. Flags may also be held in position using [[Inglefield clip]]s.<ref>Inglefield, p. 12.</ref>\n\n==Flags in communication==\n[[File:Semaphore Signals A-Z.jpg|thumb|right|Semaphore signals for the letters of the English alphabet]]\n[[Flag semaphore|Semaphore]] is a form of communication that utilises flags. The signalling is performed by an individual using two flags (or lighted wands), the positions of the flags indicating a symbol. The person who holds the flags is known as the signalman. This form of communication is primarily used by [[navy|naval]] signallers. This technique of signalling was adopted in the early 19th century and is still used in various forms today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anbg.gov.au/flags/semaphore.html|title=Semaphore Flag Signalling System|author=|date=|work=ANBG.gov.au|access-date=31 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe colours of the flags can also be used to communicate. For example; a white flag means, among other things, surrender or peace, a red flag can be used as a warning signal, and a black flag can mean war, or determination to defeat enemies.\n\nOrientation of a flag is also used for communication, though the practice is rarely used given modern communication systems. Raising a flag upside-down was indicative that the raising force controlled that particular area, but that it was in severe distress.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.military.com/flag-day/flag-ettiquette-dos-and-donts.html|title=Flag Etiquette Do's and Don'ts|last=Scanlon|first=Caitlin|work=Military.com|access-date=2017-10-05|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Flapping==\n[[File:Memphis_Tigers_Flag_video_2011-02-20.theora.ogv|thumb|Video of flag flapping]]\nWhen blown by the wind, flags are subject to wave-like motions that grow in amplitude along the length of the flag.
