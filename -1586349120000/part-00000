Its first chapter (Alpha) was founded at [[Columbia University]] on January 17, 1847, the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]].\n\nAs of 2016, nearly all chapters of St. Anthony Hall have gone co-ed; only three ([[University of Pennsylvania]], [[University of Virginia]], and [[University of Mississippi|Ole Miss]]) remain all-male.

According to its national website, St. Anthony Hall originally began in 1847 as a \"fraternity dedicated to the love of education and the well-being of its members.\"\n\nChapters were then founded throughout the Northeast, and extended into the South during the mid-19th century. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], however, formal contact ended between Northern and Southern chapters, though contact was restored between remaining and refounded chapters after the War.\n\nThe fraternity's history states that \"many members wore their badges into battle, serving with distinction on both sides, and were often reunited in both pleasant and antagonistic situations throughout the war\".\n*See the Baird's Manual excerpt below for a near-contemporary account of the disposition of the chapters following the Civil War.\n*Archive photo of Civil War officer killed at Gettysburg, who signed his portrait \"Yours in Delta Psi\".<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://gettysburg.cdmhost.com/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/p4016coll2&CISOPTR=431&CISOBOX=1&REC=80|title =O'Rorke - Patrick H.

St. A's occupies a unique status at Yale. It resembles a \"senior society\" (see [[List of Yale University student organizations]]) in that its senior members are precluded from joining another senior society; however, it is unique in that it is a three-year society, admitting members during their sophomore year. Some other Yale societies would later also transition to co-ed membership, such as [[Skull and Bones]] in 1992. (See also [[Collegiate secret societies in North America|secret society]].)\n\nIt thus had a two-year advantage over the purely senior societies in admitting female members. The Yale chapter's action also accomplished, albeit not without friction, co-education as a permitted status within the national fraternity. [[Charlie Scott]], a member of St. A's at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] became the first person of color to pledge any fraternity at that campus, in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|author=[ Displaying Abstract]|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0710FC3A5F137A93C4AB1789D85F438685F9 |title=New York Times news archive|publisher=Select.nytimes.com|date=October 9, 2011|accessdate=October 17, 2011}}</ref>\n*Other St. A's chapters subsequently became co-ed at [[Columbia University]], the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]].\n*The chapters at [[Brown University]], [[Princeton University]], and the [[University of Rochester]], all inactive since the 19th century, were re-founded as co-ed chapters in 1983, 1986, and 2010, respectively.\n*The [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[University of Mississippi]] and the [[University of Virginia]] chapters remain all-male.\n\n==Activities==\nStudent St. A's members at various chapters pursue their literary mandate through different programs. The Columbia, University of North Carolina, and Brown University chapters have published poetry journals. Also at the University of North Carolina, the chapter hosts events open to the community such as \"Poetry, Prose and Pancakes.\" The Brown University chapter publishes a literary and visual arts magazine, also available online, called \"The Sketchbook.\"\n\nThe Trinity College chapter endows a St. Anthony Professorship in Art History, several annual prizes for Trinity students, and an annual public lecture, named for Martin W. Clement (Class of 1901).\n\nYale's chapter sponsors a public series of lectures every two to three weeks on literature, poetry, art and current affairs in general. (It is compared to but more generalized than the annual Maynard Mack Lecture of [[Elizabethan Club|Yale's Elizabethan Club]], down the block, whose sessions with actors and directors focus on Shakespeare's era.) The Yale St. Anthony Hall lectures, some co-sponsored with the [[Yale Review]] recently have included [[Gay Talese]], [[D. A.

But, like most boys, he bragged tremendously about the girls of his city when he was away from it. There was Genevieve Ormonde, who regularly made the rounds of dances, house-parties, and football games at Princeton, Yale, Williams, and Cornell; there was black-eyed Roberta Dillon, who was quite as famous to her own generation as Hiram Johnson or Ty Cobb; and, of course, there was Marjorie Harvey, who besides having a fairylike face and a dazzling, bewildering tongue was already justly celebrated for having turned five cart-wheels in succession during the last '''pump-and-slipper dance''' at New Haven.\"\n**\"A Short Trip Home\", ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', January 17, 1927. ''\"Joe Jelke and two other boys were along, and none of the three could manage to take their eyes off her, even to say hello to me.

She and Joe had reached some sort of reconciliation, or at least he was too far gone in love to remember last night; but I saw that though she laughed a lot she wasn't really paying any attention to him or any of them. She wanted them to go, so that there'd be a message from the kitchen, but I knew that the message wasn't coming\u2014that she was safe. There was talk of the '''Pump and Slipper dance''' at New Haven and of the Princeton Prom, and then, in various moods, we four left and separated quickly outside.

Its 11 active chapters go by different names on different campuses, including '''Saint Anthony Hall''', '''The Order of St. Anthony''', the '''Fraternity of Delta Psi''' ('''\u0394\u03a8'''), '''St. A's''', '''the Hall''' and the '''Number Six Club'''. Its first chapter (Alpha) was founded at [[Columbia University]] on January 17, 1847, the [[Calendar of saints|feast day]] of [[Anthony the Great|St. Anthony]].\n\nAs of 2016, nearly all chapters of St. Anthony Hall have gone co-ed; only three ([[University of Pennsylvania]], [[University of Virginia]], and [[University of Mississippi|Ole Miss]]) remain all-male.

According to its national website, St. Anthony Hall originally began in 1847 as a \"fraternity dedicated to the love of education and the well-being of its members.\"\n\nChapters were then founded throughout the Northeast, and extended into the South during the mid-19th century. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], however, formal contact ended between Northern and Southern chapters, though contact was restored between remaining and refounded chapters after the War.\n\nThe fraternity's history states that \"many members wore their badges into battle, serving with distinction on both sides, and were often reunited in both pleasant and antagonistic situations throughout the war\".\n*See the Baird's Manual excerpt below for a near-contemporary account of the disposition of the chapters following the Civil War.\n*Archive photo of Civil War officer killed at Gettysburg, who signed his portrait \"Yours in Delta Psi\".<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://gettysburg.cdmhost.com/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/p4016coll2&CISOPTR=431&CISOBOX=1&REC=80|title =O'Rorke - Patrick H.

St. A's occupies a unique status at Yale. It resembles a \"senior society\" (see [[List of Yale University student organizations]]) in that its senior members are precluded from joining another senior society; however, it is unique in that it is a three-year society, admitting members during their sophomore year. Some other Yale societies would later also transition to co-ed membership, such as [[Skull and Bones]] in 1992. (See also [[Collegiate secret societies in North America|secret society]].)\n\nIt thus had a two-year advantage over the purely senior societies in admitting female members. The Yale chapter's action also accomplished, albeit not without friction, co-education as a permitted status within the national fraternity. [[Charlie Scott]], a member of St. A's at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] became the first person of color to pledge any fraternity at that campus, in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|author=[ Displaying Abstract]|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0710FC3A5F137A93C4AB1789D85F438685F9 |title=New York Times news archive|publisher=Select.nytimes.com|date=October 9, 2011|accessdate=October 17, 2011}}</ref>\n*Other St. A's chapters subsequently became co-ed at [[Columbia University]], the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], and [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]].\n*The chapters at [[Brown University]], [[Princeton University]], and the [[University of Rochester]], all inactive since the 19th century, were re-founded as co-ed chapters in 1983, 1986, and 2010, respectively.\n*The [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[University of Mississippi]] and the [[University of Virginia]] chapters remain all-male.\n\n==Activities==\nStudent St. A's members at various chapters pursue their literary mandate through different programs. The Columbia, University of North Carolina, and Brown University chapters have published poetry journals. Also at the University of North Carolina, the chapter hosts events open to the community such as \"Poetry, Prose and Pancakes.\" The Brown University chapter publishes a literary and visual arts magazine, also available online, called \"The Sketchbook.\"\n\nThe Trinity College chapter endows a St. Anthony Professorship in Art History, several annual prizes for Trinity students, and an annual public lecture, named for Martin W. Clement (Class of 1901).\n\nYale's chapter sponsors a public series of lectures every two to three weeks on literature, poetry, art and current affairs in general. (It is compared to but more generalized than the annual Maynard Mack Lecture of [[Elizabethan Club|Yale's Elizabethan Club]], down the block, whose sessions with actors and directors focus on Shakespeare's era.) The Yale St. Anthony Hall lectures, some co-sponsored with the [[Yale Review]] recently have included [[Gay Talese]], [[D. A.

Today, Lafayette is most noted for its fierce arch-rivalry with Lehigh, which is the most played rivalry in college football (151 games) and the most consecutive years played (since 1897).

Welles.  A member of the class of 1884, Welles brought football to Easton after learning the new game at Wilkes Barre Academy and Princeton University, where he studied as a college freshman.  H.R. Craven, who played and learned the sport at the [[Lawrenceville School]], served as the first team captain. Early football at Lafayette was not organized. In 1880 and 1881, students competed against each other on campus.  However, in the fall of 1882, Lafayette traveled to Rutgers to partake in its first intercollegiate football contest. On November 7, 1882, Lafayette fell to Rutgers 0-0/8-3.  One week later, Lafayette lost its second game ever against the [[Penn Quakers football|University of Pennsylvania]] 0-0/1-3.  Although official records reflect only two games being played in 1882, Welles mentions playing [[Swarthmore College]] and the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] on College Hill, winning both contests.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\">{{cite book|last=March|first=Francis A.|title=Athletics at Lafayette College|year=1926|publisher=Lafayette College|location=Easton, PA|page=37}}</ref>\n\n[[File:General Peyton March.jpg|thumb|left|250px| General [[Peyton C. March]], Class of 1884, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|U.S. Army Chief of Staff]] following World War I, was a fullback on Lafayette's first football team. He is the son of [[Francis A. March]], who originated the study of English in academia.]]With one season of intercollegiate football experience, Lafayette won its first game ever in 1883. After dropping its first three games to Princeton, Pennsylvania, and Stevens, Lafayette broke through against Rutgers on November 10.  With four inches of slushy snow covering the Quad, Lafayette avenged the previous year's defeat 25\u20130 with four touchdowns despite a water-logged ball.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\"/>\n\nThe first game of 1884 brought a new team to Lafayette's schedule: [[Lehigh University]]. Located in nearby Bethlehem, Lehigh would be playing its first football game. With experience and superior skill on its side, Lafayette annihilated Lehigh 56\u20130 in what would shortly become known as [[Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)|\"The Rivalry\"]]. Due to the proximity of the schools, Lafayette played a Lehigh as their last opponent in 1884, winning 36\u20130 in Bethlehem. True animosity soon developed between both teams. In 1886, Lafayette was winning 12\u20130 until a severe downpour halted play 15 minutes into the second half (in 1886, there were two 45 minute halves). Both team captains mutually agreed to end the game even though football tradition called for football to be played in all weather.  The game's referee wrote [[Walter Camp]] on how to resolve the game. Camp said that the game should be declared a tie, but Lehigh acknowledged they were outplayed and gave Lafayette the victory.  Later in the season, with the game scoreless late in the second half, Lehigh was protesting the officiating of the game. As the Lehigh captain pulled his team off the field in protest, Lafayette picked up the ball and scored a touchdown. To this day, Lafayette counts the game as a 4\u20130 win, while Lehigh considers the game scoreless. The schools would play each other twice per season until 1902.<ref name=\"Davidson and Donchez 1997 268\">{{cite book|last=Davidson and Donchez|first=Todd and Bob|title=Legends of Lehigh \u2013 Lafayette|year=1997|publisher=D&D Publishing Company|location=Bethlehem, PA|isbn=0-9640341-1-5|page=268}}</ref>\n\nA bitter rivalry also emerged with Pennsylvania. During their annual contest on the Lafayette Quad on November 6, 1889, Lafayette's right tackle Wells, who had been ejected by the umpire earlier in the contest, tripped a Pennsylvania player running with the ball along the sidelines.  As the two players converged following the trip, a crowd of spectators surged the Penn player and \"struck, kicked, and generally misused him.\" Many outside newspapers trumped up the incident to make it seem like a mob had severely beaten the Penn player and there was general unruliness at the Lafayette game.  However, since it was the late 19th century, it is possible that the account of the unruly mob was an instance of [[yellow journalism]]. Additionally, the umpire who ejected Wells, Dr. Shell, was from the University of Pennsylvania and was cited in the newspaper for making several bad calls against Lafayette, including negating a five-point field goal on a phantom offside. Regardless, Pennsylvania was upset about the altercation relations between the two schools were strained. The incident was a key catalyst in forming the Alumni Advisory Committee in January 1890. Pennsylvania played only two more times at Lafayette, in 1891 and 1893, until 1973.<ref name=\"Davidson and Donchez 1997 268\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=November 14, 1889|url=http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=21299&REC=17|work=The Lafayette|publisher=Lafayette College|accessdate=March 24, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813071209/http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Fnewspaper&CISOPTR=21299&REC=17|archive-date=August 13, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there were no formal conferences, Lafayette, Lehigh, and Pennsylvania were loosely affiliated and their games, two against each opponent, were considered the battle for the Pennsylvania State Championship\n\n===College football upstart (1891\u20131918)===\nAfter being managed by students, Lafayette hired its first paid football coach for the 1891 season, W.S. Moyle.  Moyle was hired from [[Yale Bulldogs football|Yale University]] since he was familiar with the Yale system and was considered a good player. His stipend was $400.  As coach from 1891 to 1892, Moyle played in nearly every game and carried the ball on nearly every down.  He was lauded as a football hero until the faculty disapproved of his playing.  However, he was regarded as 'good coach' who 'taught for the first time what teamwork was.'<ref name=\"March 1926 272\"/>\n\nDespite hiring coaches, Lafayette's record had a losing record each season. Between 1891 and 1894, Lafayette went 2\u20139 against Lehigh, including two losses and a neutral site loss before 3,000 spectators in Wilkes-Barre in 1891.\n\nIn 1895, the alumni athletic advisors hired who would become a legendary college football figure, [[Parke H. Davis]].  Writing a history of Lafayette Athletics in 1926, [[Francis A. March, Jr.]] said, \"With the advent of Davis, little Lafayette stepped from comparative obscurity to a level with the football giants.\" Davis, who played at Princeton, was the first coach hired based on experience, having coached [[Amherst College]] and the [[Wisconsin Badgers football|University of Wisconsin]] in previous seasons.  Lafayette went 6\u20132 and had its first winning season since 1888 swept Lehigh for the first time since 1886. Davis is credited with bringing organization, recognition, and enthusiasm to Lafayette football through his charismatic personality and writing college fight songs. In 1896, Lafayette won its first [[List of college football national champions|National Championship]],<ref name=\"March 1926 272\"/>  which featured a dramatic 6\u20134 win against Pennsylvania at Franklin Field.\n\n[[File:LafayettePennFootballOct23.1896.jpg|thumb|right|400px| Lafayette holds Penn on defense in the 1896 \"National Championship game\" at Franklin Field on October 24. Lafayette won in a 6\u20134 upset, the only loss for Penn in a 66-game stretch. Two Lafayette players are wearing the first football helmet, one of them being inventor George \"Rose\" Barclay.]]\n\nDavis coached one more season, a 9\u20132\u20131 campaign in 1897.  [[Samuel B. Newton]], who arrived after coaching [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] led Lafayette to its most victories ever with a 12\u20131 record in 1899, with a lone 12\u20130 defeat to national champions Princeton (12\u20131) and outscoring opponents 253\u201323. Newton was 7\u20130 against Lehigh and 33\u201314 overall through his last season of 1902 before leaving Lafayette to coach Lehigh. In four games against Lafayette, Newton only won twice while going 23\u201320\u20132 overall. During this time, Newton coached [[Walter Ellsworth Bachman, Sr.|Walter E. Bachman]], who developed the roving center concept in football.  Bachman was named second-team All-American by Walter Camp in 1900 and 1901, one of the first players outside of the 'Big Four' to earn the honor.<ref name=\"Lewis 1982 23\"/>\n\nThe legendary roll of Lafayette coaches continued after the departure of Newton.  Dr. [[Alfred E. Bull]] coached between 1903 and 1907, compiling a 37\u201310\u20133 record in five seasons, with one loss to Lehigh. Tragically, Lafayette football hero and helmet inventor George \"Rose\" Barclay, who became coach in 1908 and was the first Lafayette player to coach the team, died following after one season after suffering from an appendicitis. His successor, [[Bob Folwell]], became one of the most decorated coaches in Lafayette history by posting a 19\u20132\u20131 record.  Folwell led the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|University of Iowa]] to its first conference championship and after Lafayette, led [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson College]] to be recognized as 'an elite power team,' along with [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]], the [[University of Chicago]], and [[Yale Bulldogs football|Yale]]. In 1925, he became the first coach of the [[New York Giants]].\n\nFolwell coached Lafayette to its first win against [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton]] on October 23, 1909 in what the New York Times said was, \"the most sensational finish that has ever been seen in a football game.\" With six second remaining and the score 0\u20130, Princeton was set to attempt a game-winning field goal from the Lafayette 10-yard line. Irmschler blitzed through the tackle and guard, caught the ball as it left the kicker's foot, and raced 92-yards for the win as time expired for a 6\u20130 win.  The team was greeted with a jubilant crowd that paraded through Easton and College Hill when the team returned.<ref>{{cite news|title=Princeton Beaten in Last Minute|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/10/24/106777689.pdf|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=April 2, 2011|date=October 24, 1909}}</ref> In their next game two weeks later, Lafayette tied Pennsylvania 6\u20136 and ultimately finished second behind Yale (10\u20130\u20130) in the East and for the national championship. Lafayette outscored the opposition 176\u20136.\n\nFolwell left in the middle of the 1911 season with Lafayette holding a 5\u20130 record. It came at an inopportune moment as Lafayette was set to host the [[Carlisle Indians]] and [[Jim Thorpe]].  Lafayette lost 19\u20130 and went 2\u20133 the rest of the season under S.B. Newton.<ref name=\"LaBella\">{{cite web|last=LaBella|first=Phil|title=2010 Lafayette Leopards Media Guide|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/lafa/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2010_FBmediaguide_LR.pdf|work=Lafayette Athletics|publisher=Lafayette Department of Athletics|accessdate=April 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===National college football power (1919\u20131948)===\nBetween 1921 and 1948, Lafayette was considered one of the premiere college football programs.  The team earned two national championships, had four undefeated seasons, featured several All-Americans, played in major games, and was involved in several bowl scenarios.  During nearly every season of the era, the team was led by a coach that would later be inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n====The 1920s====\n[[File:Sutherland Lafayette College coach.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Jock Sutherland coached Lafayette from 1919\u20131923. He is considered one of the greatest coaches of all-time and was 33\u20138\u20132 on College Hill. He ranks fourth in Lafayette winning percentage.]] The hiring of [[Jock Sutherland]] in 1919 started Lafayette on the road to national prominence during the 1920s. After coaching an undefeated team at an Army base in Georgia during World War I and only a few years removed from playing for the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]], Sutherland was prepared to enter a career in dentistry.  However, a chance meeting with a friend propelled Sutherland to take a coaching job at Lafayette.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\" /> \n    \nLafayette finished 1919 at 6\u20132 and 5\u20133 the following season.  According to Sutherland, with virtually the same team as 1920, Lafayette went 9\u20130 in 1921 and went on a 17-game winning streak that stretched between 1920 and 1922, where Lafayette outscored opponents 495\u201347, with wins over major teams such as Penn, coached by [[John Heisman]], Pittsburgh (twice), [[Fordham Rams football|Fordham University]], and [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]]. During the national championship season of 1921, no team came within three touchdowns of Lafayette except Pittsburgh, coached by Pop Warner.  Late in the game, Lafayette used a triple pass and touchdown by \u2018Bots\u2019 Brunner near the Pitt goal line to gain a 6\u20130 lead.  Pitt was inside the Lafayette ten with under two minutes to play, but an illegal substitution by Pitt cost the Panthers dearly and Lafayette held on for the win.<ref name=\"Lewis 1982 23\" />\n\nSix games into the 1922 season, Lafayette was poised to claim another national championship.  The Maroon defeated Pittsburgh at [[Forbes Field]], the only loss of the season for a 10\u20131 team that claimed a 'post-season' victory at Stanford. Facing the [[1922 Rose Bowl]] participant [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson]] before 38,000 at the [[Polo Grounds]] in New York City, Lafayette took a commanding 13\u20130 halftime lead.  However, a dramatic and miraculous comeback by the Presidents resulted in a 14\u201313 Maroon defeat, one of the most bitter in Lafayette football history.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\" />\n\nSutherland coached the Maroon until 1923, when he returned to his alma mater, Pittsburgh, for the 1924 season. New coach [[Herb McCracken]], also a recent player under [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]], quickly proved himself by defeating Sutherland at Pittsburgh 10\u20130 in the second game of the season.  McCracken won his first five games before falling to [[Penn Quakers football|Pennsylvania]] 6\u20133. Before the game, McCracken discovered that Penn had decoded Lafayette's play-calling signals.  McCracken responded with a new and innovative solution: the [[huddle]]. Although McCracken is often credited as the inventor of the huddle, there are earlier, though some less substantiated claims of other schools implementing the huddle only a few years earlier.<ref name=\"Nytimes.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Edmonston Jr.|first=George|title=Part 20 of 20: The Tractor That Could and Other Interesting OSU Firsts|url=http://www.osualum.com/s/359/index.aspx?sid=359&gid=1&pgid=361|work=Oregon State Alumni Association|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=July 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAt the start of the 1926 season, Lafayette inaugurated its new, unfinished 18,000 seat stadium with a 35\u20130 win over [[Muhlenberg College]].

In 1929, Lafayette joined with Lehigh and Rutgers to form the [[Middle Three Conference]], which consisted of round-robin games between the two teams.  The schools split the first year of the series at 1\u20131\u20130 each. Lafayette won their first Middle Three title the following season.\n\n====The 1930s====\nLafayette made college football history on October 25, 1930, when the Leopards and [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson]] played the first night indoor college football game in history at the [[Boardwalk Hall|Atlantic City Boardwalk Hall]] before 25,000.  The Presidents won 7\u20130 on an easy touchdown within the two-yard line with the help of a play that is illegal today \u2013 a recovered \u201cfumble\u201d by pushing a Lafayette defender into the kicker and the ball.  In their final game of the season, Lafayette defeated Lehigh 16\u20136 before 20,000 at Fisher Field, the largest crowd to witness [[Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)|\"The Rivalry\"]] at the time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lafayette Files Protest|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/10/29/102181565.pdf|accessdate=August 5, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 28, 1930}}</ref>\n\nAfter a 7\u20132 season in 1931, Lafayette's record began to decline.  Coach [[Herb McCracken]] had only won less than five games once since his first season in 1924, but did not win more than three games through his final season at Lafayette in 1935. Although he was only 36 at the time, McCracken retired from coaching to help friend Maurice Robinson start-up [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Publications]] and write a popular magazine, Scholastic Coach.<ref name=\"Nytimes.com\"/>\n\nTo return the Leopards to the spotlight, Lafayette called on [[Ernie Nevers]], an assistant coach at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]] who helped lead the Indians to three straight [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] games. Nevers, along with [[Jim Thorpe]], was considered one of the two best college football players ever and had a legendary career in the early [[NFL]]. Hope was high on College Hill as the 1935 freshman team went undefeated against the leading freshmen teams of the East, including Princeton.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nevers Named Lafayette Coach from Field of 100 Aspirants|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1936/01/18/88626245.pdf|accessdate=August 5, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 17, 1936}}</ref>  However, with a young team plagued by injuries, the Leopards went 1\u20138, their worst record since their first season of football in 1882, and were blown out in their last five games. Despite stating he would stay for the 1937 season, Nevers resigned to become an assistant coach at the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|University of Iowa]].\n\nAbsent a coach for the second straight season, Lafayette turned to [[Edward Mylin|Edward \u201cHook\u201d Mylin]], the inaugural [[Orange Bowl]] winning head coach of [[Bucknell University]]. In one of the most remarkable turnarounds in college football at the time, the 1\u20138 Leopards of 1936 went 8\u20130 in 1937.  Furthermore, the Leopards posted seven shutouts, outscored opponents 130\u20136, and featured an unscored upon defense, including a 13\u20130 win over heavily favored [[New York University]] at Yankee Stadium.  The key win featured a key 79-yard punt by quarterback Tommy Kearns and a 50-yard and 30-yard touchdown pass.  Media sources such as \u201cThe Lafayette\u201d student newspaper began referring to the 1937 team as the \u201cMylin Miracle Men\u201d since the victory left Lafayette as the only undefeated, untied, and unscored upon team in the East.<ref>{{cite news|last=Anstett|first=Bob|title=Unbeaten Maroon Upsets NYU 13\u20130|url=http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=12537&CISOSHOW=12533&REC=15|accessdate=August 7, 2011|newspaper=The Lafayette|date=October 26, 1937|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321191806/http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Fnewspaper&CISOPTR=12537&CISOSHOW=12533&REC=15|archive-date=March 21, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Two games later, Lafayette surrendered their only touchdown of the season against Rutgers.

With a narrow 9\u20137 win over [[New York University]] in their second game and missing several injured players, Lafayette carried a 4\u20130 record into their meeting with [[Army Black Knights football|Army]] at [[West Point]]. The team was suddenly awakened at 4 a.m. as the Cadets, cavalrymen, and horses paraded in front of the team hotel in an attempt to rattle the Leopards. It was also an important date at West Point since a visiting delegation of South American generals would be reviewing the cadets before the game. Army advanced deep into Lafayette territory early in the first quarter, but a missed field goal and key stops kept the Leopards in the game. Zirinsky scored in the third for a 6\u20130 lead, a spread formation newly unveiled by Mylin helped Lafayette to a 12\u20130 lead. A 70-yard interception return by Zirinsky in the final minute sealed Lafayette's 19\u20130 win.  Despite injuries and facing many Army substitutes, Lafayette outgained Army 184\u2013104. The following week, Army fell to [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] 7\u20130 on a returned interception, leading many writers to compare Lafayette to Notre Dame.  As of 2011, the 1940 victory over Army is Lafayette's only victory in 20 meetings.<ref name=\"Lewis 1982 23\" />\n\nTwo weeks later, Lafayette edged [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers University]] by an extra point 7\u20136 in New Brunswick before 20,000.  At 8\u20130, Lafayette demolished Lehigh 46\u20130.

Drafted by the [[Cleveland Rams]] in 1942, Zirinsky played in only the 1945 season.<ref name=\"LaBella\"/>\n\nWorld War II soon impacted the Leopard football as many players and coaches became enlisted men, including Mylin. Lafayette went 3\u20135\u20131 in 1942, including a 19\u201313 win over the [[Virginia Cavaliers football|University of Virginia]] at Fisher Field and coming up one-yard short against Lehigh in the final seconds of a 7\u20137 tie.  In 1943 and 1944, Lafayette continued to play football as other colleges suspended their programs such as nearby [[Moravian College]], the former team of new Leopard coach [[Ben Wolfson]].  Unlike Harvard and Yale, Lafayette and Lehigh continued their rivalry, playing each other twice, as well as Rutgers twice and one game against nearby Willow Grove Naval Air Station.<ref name=\"LaBella\"/> Only 5,000 attended the game in Easton, and 3,500 in Taylor Stadium, both Lafayette routs and devoid of bands or cheerleaders. In 1944, Lafayette expanded their schedule to include \u2018local\u2019 trips to [[Syracuse Orangemen football|Syracuse University]] and NYU, as well as two games against Rutgers and Lehigh. Only 300 fans attended the first game against Lehigh in a rainstorm.

Lafayette accepted the bid contingent upon being able to bring [[David Showell]], an African-American halfback and former [[Tuskegee Airmen|Tuskegee Airman]].  Texas law at the time prohibited African-Americans from playing on the same field as Caucasian players in a state-supported stadium. Showell's team members also did not want to accept the bid unless Showell could accompany the team to El Paso. The Chairman of the Sun Bowl, C.D.

The Athletic Department did not issue a reason for the rejection, prompting a protest of 1,500 students and a bonfire.  The students marched on the President's house, demanding an explanation. President Ralph Cooper Hutchison explained the situation and along with student leaders, phoned the Bowl Committee chairman to reconsider.  Upon a prompt rejection by Belding, the student protest marched downtown and received an audience at the local radio station.

Lafayette gradually de-emphasized football with the inauguration of alumnus [[Ralph Cooper Hutchinson]] as president of the College.  At [[Washington & Jefferson College]], where he had been president from 1931 to 1945, Hutchinson had presided over the de-emphasis of the [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Presidents]] national profile in light of improper payments to players.  Additionally, with the rise of state universities through the influx of returning servicemen and state funding, Lafayette and other small private schools were at a competitive disadvantage in financial support and recruiting. During this era, Lafayette defeated Lehigh only eight times out of 31 games and Rutgers only three times through the cessation of the rivalry in 1975.\n\nFollowing the departure of [[Ivy Williamson|Ivan Williamson]] to the [[Wisconsin Badgers football|University of Wisconsin]], [[Maurice J. \"Clipper\" Smith]], who lost only two games as the coach of [[Villanova Wildcats football|Villanova]], only won four games between 1949 and 1951. However, he led the 1\u20136 Leopards to a 21\u201312 win over a 6\u20132 Lehigh team in 1949.  Lafayette was losing 12\u20130 at halftime before a ferocious comeback gave the Leopards their seventh straight win over Lehigh and as of 2011, is the largest upset (record-wise) by the Leopards in the series to date.  Lehigh rebounded the next year for their first win since 1936 and go undefeated for the first time in their history.\n\n[[Steve Hokuf]] took over as head coach in 1952 and led the Leopards to their first winless season since the program's first year in 1882.  However, Lafayette rebounded and won three straight games against Lehigh through 1955, their last three-game winning streak until 2004\u20132006.  The 1955 season was also one of the best of the era as the 6\u20132 Leopards scored two upset wins.  Traveling to [[Dartmouth Big Green football|Dartmouth College]] as a 13-point underdog, Lafayette scored a 21\u201313 win for their first win over an [[Ivy League]] team since a 1923 win over [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]].<ref name=\"Lewis 1982 23\" /> Several weeks later, Lafayette defeated Rutgers 16\u20137 and Lehigh in the last week of the season to capture their last outright Middle Three Conference championship. Lafayette won six games in 1956 and would not win as many games until going 7\u20132 in 1968.\n\nLafayette and Lehigh made college football history in 1964.  Both schools met in Easton for the 100th edition of [[Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)|\"The Rivalry\"]] before a sold-out crowd and national media attention.  Ironically, it was one of the worst ever match-ups of the Rivalry as Lafayette was winless and Lehigh had one win.  The game fared no better as the schools played to a 6\u20136 tie, and both schools missed an extra point.\n\nLafayette soon hired [[Harry Gamble]], who would achieve later prominence as a coach at Penn and president of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].  Gamble was the only coach between [[Edward Mylin|Edward \u201cHook\u201d Mylin]] and [[Bill Russo (American football)|Bill Russo]] to have a winning record as coach of the Leopards.  In his second season in 1968, Gamble led Lafayette to their best record since 1948 with a 7\u20133 mark.  The team had a three and four-game winning streak and was ranked first in the Lambert Cup poll as the best team in the east, but was upset at home by a two-win Lehigh team, 21\u201316.  Wide receiver Mike Miller was named to the honorable mention 'Little' All-American team, the first time since 1940 any Lafayette player was mentioned on an All-American list.  Gamble also went 2\u20132 against Lehigh, the best record of any coach from the era.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nThe end of the Gamble era in the early 1970s saw the emergence of running back Tony Giglio, who would become one of the most prolific rushers in Lafayette history.  Giglio amassed 2,519 yards and 22 touchdowns in only three seasons, including a 238-yard outburst in a 19-point loss at Colgate.  Giglio was named third-team All-America by the Associated Press in 1973, the first Leopard team placement since legendary rusher [[George Wilson (American football halfback)|Mike \u201cGeorge\u201d Wilson]] in 1926.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nLafayette continued to struggle on the field, never winning more than five games until 1981.  In 1971, the Leopards scored an upset win over Penn in Gamble's first season as the Quaker's coach.  The 17\u201315 at Franklin Field was the first Lafayette win over Penn since 1923. The season also featured the Leopards last ever win (as of 2011) over Rutgers.\n\nDespite mediocre records of three and five win seasons, the Lafayette student newspaper editorialized in 1975 that the program was in a 25-year demise between 1949 and 1975 and was being dominated by teams which the paper considered football 'powers.' Between 1960 and 1974, Lafayette went 10\u201356\u20131 against Bucknell, Colgate, Delaware, Lehigh, Penn, and Rutgers.  Citing poor morale on campus and the administration's unwillingness to commit to improving the program and attributing losing to a 'temporary down cycle', the paper editorialized, \"Let's get rid of Colgate and yes, even Lehigh.  Both schools have moved onto higher football plateaus... the Engineers are actively seeking greater things for their program, while Lafayette only seems to be striving for mediocrity.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Abt|first=Lee|title=The \"25 Year 'Slump\"|url=http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=4679&CISOSHOW=4669&REC=10|accessdate=December 3, 2011|newspaper=The Lafayette|date=November 21, 1975|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406075351/http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Fnewspaper&CISOPTR=4679&CISOSHOW=4669&REC=10|archive-date=April 6, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>   The rivalry with Rutgers ended that season as the Leopards were blown out in their last three meetings.\n\nLafayette managed a 21\u201317 upset of Lehigh in 1976, but finished no better than .500 or defeated Lehigh through the remainder of Neil Putman's tenure in 1980.\n\n===Resurgence and Rebirth under Russo (1981\u20131996)===\n{{very long section|date=December 2018}}\nWith the hiring of [[Bill Russo (American football)|Bill Russo]], Lafayette football completed an unheralded rebirth and ushered in an era of explosive offensive. Through Russo's first 16 seasons, the Leopards finished below .500 only three times. In the preceding 30 years, the Leopards only had ten winning seasons and won more than six games five times.\n\nRusso quickly asserted his new style by winning the first five games of the season, a first since 1956, and entered the season finale against Lehigh with an identical 8\u20132 record. Despite being huge underdogs against the Lambert Cup leading Engineers, the Leopards relied upon their defense to spring a 10\u20133 upset at Taylor Stadium. Even though Lafayette finished with one more win than Lehigh and played a near identical schedule, Lafayette was denied a bid to the Division I-AA playoffs and finished fourth in the Lambert Cup poll. As of 2012, the 1981 game, along with 2004, is the highest combined win total for each school entering the season finale.\n\nSuccess continued under Russo as the Leopards defeated Lehigh for a second straight year and won seven games. The era also saw the inaugural season of the Colonial League in 1986, which later became known as the [[Patriot League]].\n\nAfter beating Lehigh in 1984 and 1986, the Leopards finally won their first Colonial League championship in 1988 with an 8\u20132\u20131 mark.  In the second game of 1988, Lafayette scored a monumental 28\u201320 upset over [[Holy Cross Crusaders football|Holy Cross]].  The previous season, Holy Cross finished 11\u20130 and No. 1 in the final 1987 NCAA Division I-AA poll and its best player [[Gordie Lockbaum]], finished third in the [[Heisman Trophy]] voting. With another win in 1992, Lafayette was the only Patriot League team to defeat Holy Cross between its dominant run against Eastern football between 1986 and 1993.\n\nThe 1988 season was one of the best in Lafayette history and witnessed the emergence of its best quarterback ever, Frank Baur.  Baur smashed and rewrote nearly every Lafayette offensive and passing record with a cannon arm. In the 1988 season, he led the nation in passing efficiency at 64% and led the Leopards to finish as the second-ranked offense. He finished his career with 8,399 yards and 62 touchdowns, which stood until 2003.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nBaur also achieved fame by being the only Lafayette and Patriot League athlete, as well as one of only a few non-BCS collegiate athletes, to appear on the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]]. He appeared on the cover of the September 4, 1989 college football preview and was projected to be one of the first three quarterbacks taken in the 1990 NFL Draft, along with [[Troy Aikman]] and [[Steve Walsh (American football)|Steve Walsh]]. After being selected the [[Hula Bowl]] following his senior season, Baur was drafted but later cut by the New York Giants.<ref>{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Bruce|title=AT THE PIANO OR AT QUARTERBACK, FRANK BAUR OF LAFAYETTE GIVES A VIRTUOSO PERFORMANCE|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068753/index.htm|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=February 1, 2012|date=September 4, 1989}}</ref>\n\nThe 1988 team also featured Lafayette's record-breaking running back and wide receiver up to that time. As a freshman, Tom Costello ran for 1132 yards and later grabbed the record from Giglio with 1,397 yards in 1989. Phillip Ng served as Baur's primary target and raked in 13 touchdowns and 1,048 yards. His touchdown mark still stands as the most in Leopards history and was the first Leopard to catch over 1,000 yards in a season.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nWith the Colonial League championship up for grabs, the 1988 [[The Rivalry (Lehigh\u2013Lafayette)|Lafayette-Lehigh]] meeting surpassed all hype. Lafayette rolled to a 52\u201345 win in an explosive game, where both teams passed for over 300 yards by halftime and broke many Rivalry records that still stand today.\n\nRusso was also acknowledged following the 1988 season by winning the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year award, which is presented to the best coach in Division I-AA.\n\nLafayette won the Patriot League championship for the second time in 1992 and was the only school aside from Holy Cross to win the league championship at the time.  At 8\u20133, Lafayette finished the season on a six-game winning streak and lost two games each by three points.  During the season, Erik Marsh burst onto the scene and became the most prolific rusher in Lafayette football history.  He rushed for 1,365 yards as a sophomore to set the record, only to break his own mark with 1,441 the next season.  The record still stands today and is one of the highest single season totals in Patriot League history.  During the 1992 season, Tom Kirchoff also established records as one of the most efficient quarterbacks in Lafayette history.  Ranking only second to Baur at the time, Kirchoff threw for 26 touchdowns and nine interceptions, the best spread ever in a single season.  His 26 touchdowns stood as a Lafayette record until 2009.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nDespite the loss of Kirchoff to graduation, Lafayette's offense continued to excel with Marsh through 1994.  The running back essentially had a player's average career season against Lehigh alone, rushing for over 800 yards in four games against the Engineers, including 251 yards in 1992 and 249 yards in 1993.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nThe 1994 season was arguably one of the most bizarre yet triumphant season's in Lafayette football history despite finishing with a 5\u20136 record.  After losing their first six games of the season, including five losses by more than two touchdowns, the Leopards went on to win their last five games of the season to capture their third Patriot League championship. In their five wins, Lafayette allowed only more than two touchdowns once, with the only exception being a 56\u201320 drubbing of Lehigh.<ref name=LaBella />\n\n===The \"Study\" Years (1997\u20131999)===\nDespite decades of rich tradition, Lafayette nearly dropped its football program from Division I to Division III or outright cancelled the program.  As early as 1996, athletics director Eve Atkinson made proposals to de-emphasize portions of the department.  Poor overall performance, interdepartmental budget conflicts, and issues with coach-recommended athletes competing in the admissions pool were factors cited for all athletics programs as a reason for downgrading to Division III.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chiger and Dorsch|first=Stephen and Steve|title=Significant changes to Lafayette sports proposed|url=http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=32163&CISOSHOW=32149&REC=1|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708080254/http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=32163&CISOSHOW=32149&REC=1|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 8, 2012|accessdate=February 3, 2012|newspaper=The Lafayette|date=October 30, 1998}}</ref> Several faculty argued that football should be eliminated to achieve budget savings and that the sport should not be a focus of the student body.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abels|first=James|title=Committee examines D-I to D-III Switch|url=http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=37216&CISOSHOW=37204&REC=6|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714194048/http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=37216&CISOSHOW=37204&REC=6|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 14, 2012|accessdate=February 3, 2012|newspaper=The Lafayette|date=December 11, 1998}}</ref> The trustees ultimately voted to remain Division I and continue football.<ref>{{cite news|last=Julin|first=Matt|title=Campus considers athletics decision|url=http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=34749&CISOSHOW=34741&REC=7|accessdate=February 3, 2012|newspaper=The Lafayette|date=January 29, 1999}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nConsiderable damage was done to the program during the period.  Prospective recruits would not consider Lafayette based upon rumor of a downgrade or elimination of football, and current players transferred. Russo's teams, which had only four losing seasons in his first 15 years and did not win less than four games once, went a combined 10\u201323 in the next three seasons.  Miraculously, Russo's teams contested Lehigh closely during the era, including a two-point loss to an undefeated Lehigh squad in his final game in 1999.\n\n===Frank Tavani era (2000\u20132016)===\n{{very long section|date=December 2018}}\n[[Frank Tavani]] was named head coach following the retirement of Russo in December 1999.  Tavani had been a coach on Russo's staff since 1986 and was most recently the associate head coach.  Challenges confronted the program at every angle: the recent study to disband or de-emphasize the program had left Lafayette in a disadvantaged position on the recruiting trail.  Also, the success of Lehigh reaching double-digit wins and playoff berths each season since 1998, coupled with aged facilities, placed Lafayette in the shadow of its regional rival.  However, Tavani's vision helped revitalize the program within five seasons and led to three consecutive championships and playoff appearances, nine winning seasons, national rankings, and a string of four consecutive victories over Lehigh.\n\nThe tide began to turn with the arrival of quarterback Marko Glavic in Tavani's first season.  The Canadian native was initially recruited to [[Bowling Green University]], but offensive coordinator [[Mike Faragalli]]'s move to Lafayette prompted Bowling Green to rescind Glavic's scholarship offer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Larimer|first=Terry|title=Lafayette's Tavani Glad To Get Glavic|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2000-03-23/sports/3286131_1_recruits-patriot-league-division|work=Morning Call|accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>   Glavic, who won the [[Patriot League]] rookie of the year by throwing for 1,964 yards and 12 touchdowns, surpassed many of Baur's records and finished as Lafayette's all-time leading quarterback with 9,819 yards and tied Baur with 62 touchdowns.  Glavic was the all-time Patriot League passing leader until [[Dominic Randolph]] of Holy Cross surpassed the mark in 2008.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nLafayette continued to score recruiting gains with the arrival of running back Joe McCourt, the 2000 [[Philadelphia Inquirer]] player of the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lafayette Football Announces Class of 2005|url=http://www.goleopards.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/031201aaa.html|work=goleopards.com}}</ref>   Several key linemen were also recruited in 2001, and success continued in 2002 with many key defensive players that built Lafayette's title run, such as All-American linebacker Maurice Bennett and future NFL player [[Blake Costanzo]].\n\nLafayette won two games each in Tavani's first two seasons, but the Leopards surpassed all expectations in 2002 by going 7\u20135, tying for second place, and upsetting Lehigh 14\u20137.  The Mountain Hawks entered the season ranked as the nation's number one team and had beaten Lafayette for seven straight seasons.  With the score tied 7\u20137 in the fourth quarter, the Leopards engineered \"The Drive,\" a 19-play, nine-minute drive that resulted in Joe McCourt's winning touchdown dive.<ref name=LaBella />  However, \"The Drive's\" biggest play occurred on a fake field goal attempt.  Lafayette was set to kick a 58-yard field goal, but holder Mike O'Connor changed the play and scurried eight yards for a first down to keep the march alive.\n\nExpectations were high in 2003, but Lafayette went 5\u20136.  However, Glavic and McCourt contributed record-breaking efforts.  Glavic threw for a record 2,725 yards, while McCourt ran for 1,393 yards, the third most behind Marsh and Costello, and 15 touchdowns, the most since Nick Kowigos in 1982.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nDespite losing Glavic to graduation, many key players returned to the Leopards in 2004 and led Lafayette to its first ever postseason appearance and first Patriot League Championship since 1994.  The Leopards signaled their championship form with an upset 21\u201316 win over scholarship [[Richmond Spiders football|University of Richmond]] and a game saving tackle inside the one-yard line in a 14\u201313 win at Bucknell.  Quarterback Brad Maurer emerged as a dual run-and-pass threat for the Leopards by throwing and rushing for over 100 yards at Fordham, Tavani's first win over the Rams.  Lafayette entered their game as underdogs to Lehigh, ranked number eight in the polls, but the dual-threat ability of Maurer, McCourt's 23 carries, and a punishing defensive effort, propelled the Leopards to a 24\u201310 win.  The Leopards fell the following week to the [[Delaware Blue Hens football|University of Delaware]] when a game-tying touchdown drive was intercepted and returned for a score, but ended the season ranked 19 in two polls.  It was Lafayette's first ranking since the 1997 preseason.  McCourt finished the season with 16 touchdowns, tying Tom Costello in 1989 as second most behind [[George Wilson (American football halfback)|Mike \u201cGeorge\u201d Wilson]]'s 20 scores in 1926.  McCourt also finished his career second to Marsh with 4,474 yards and the 50 touchdowns, the most at Lafayette.  He also finished with the fifth most career receptions ever, 139, and ranks 11th in career receiving yards.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nSuccess continued into 2005 as Maurer and a stingy defense led the Leopards to a second consecutive Patriot League Championship season, playoff berth, and 8\u20134 record.  The Leopards entered their final game of the season at 12th ranked Lehigh needing a win to tie for the Patriot League championship and keep their slim playoff hopes alive.  On the first drive, Maurer was injured and replaced by back-up quarterback Pat Davis.  Though up 10\u20133 at halftime, Lafayette was down 19\u201317 in the fourth quarter.  With 38 seconds remaining and Lafayette facing its potential last play, Davis chucked a 37-yard touchdown strike to running back Jonathan Hurt, who managed to sneak behind the last defender at the five for the reception and skipped into the end-zone for the winning 23\u201319 score.  The play, known as \"The Big Hurt,\" is one of the most famous plays in the storied [[Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)|\"Rivalry\"]].  Future NFL San Francisco 49er Blake Costanzo terrorized Lehigh with three sacks.  Following the win, Lafayette was awarded an at-large berth into the NCAA playoffs, assisted by its 7\u20130 win over Richmond, a top 15 team, earlier in the season.  Though Lafayette fell to [[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State]], the eventual national champions, after being tied 20\u201320 entering the fourth quarter, the Leopards ended the season ranked in the top 25.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nLafayette earned its third consecutive trip to the NCAA Division I FCS Playoffs by clinching its third straight Patriot League Championship in 2006.  The championship run was second to only 1994 in terms of improbability.  After being ranked as high as 22 in week two, Lafayette lost its next five games.  At 2\u20135, the Leopards earned a momentum-changing win at Colgate, Tavani's first over.  Lafayette won its next three games, including what is known as the \"Shock and Awe\" game over Lehigh.  Lafayette scored 28 points in eight minutes during the first half and led 28\u201321 at halftime.  Lehigh cut the score to 28\u201327, but Lafayette scored 21 unanswered points in compiling 500 yards of offense.  Maurer and Hurt were named game co-MVPs, one of only two occasions that the award was shared.<ref name=LaBella />  The game was also characterized by many vicious Lafayette hits.\n\nThe 2006 season also witnessed the reopening of [[Fisher Field]].  During the off-season, the 80-year-old stadium underwent extensive renovations that included new bleachers, press box, scoreboard, FieldTurf, and a football varsity house complex, among many other additions.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nWinning seasons continued through 2009.  Lafayette defeated Lehigh for the fourth straight year in 2007, the first such string of Leopard victories since the 1943\u20131949 seasons. In 2008, Lafayette knocked-off 14th-ranked [[Liberty Flames football|Liberty University]] on their home field to end the nation's longest active home winning streak.  Led by quarterback Rob Curley, the Leopards had a record-breaking campaign in 2009.  After starting 1\u20131, Lafayette won seven straight games, their longest in-season winning streak since the 9\u20130 1940 squad.  The Leopards were also ranked 20th, the sixth straight season that they were in the top 25.  Curley also had a record campaign by being the only Lafayette quarterback to throw for over 3,000 yards in a season and finished with a Lafayette record 28 touchdowns.  He also threw for a record seven touchdowns in a wild 56\u201349 win over nationally ranked Colgate.  At 8\u20131, Lafayette lost their next two games and their chance at a league championship.  A two-point loss to eventual champion Holy Cross under controversial circumstances and an overtime upset loss at Lehigh kept the Leopards from their fourth playoff berth and title of the Tavani era.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nThe Leopards struggled in the 2010 and 2011 seasons as injuries, depth, and the loss of many key players had a tremendous impact on the team. On November 30, 2016, [[Frank Tavani]] left Lafayette after 30 years on staff and 40 years of coaching college football.<ref>https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/lafayette/index.ssf/2016/11/post_19.html</ref>\n\n=== John Garrett era (2016\u2013present) ===\nOn December 21, 2016, former NFL assistant and college football assistant coach [[John Garrett (American football)|John Garrett]] (brother of Head Coach Jason Garrett of the Dallas Cowboys) was named the new Lafayette head football coach.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.goleopards.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/113016aaa.html|title=Tavani Steps Down after 17 Seasons|access-date=December 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Conference affiliations==\nLafayette has been both an independent and affiliated with two conferences.<ref name=\"2018MG\" />{{rp|124\u2013132}}\n* Independent (1882\u20131985){{better citation|date=December 2018}}\n* [[Patriot League|Colonial League]] (1986\u20131989)\n* [[Patriot League]] (1990\u2013present)\n\n==Head coaches==\nThe following served as head coach at Lafayette.<ref name=\"2018MG\" />{{rp|123}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Lafayette Leopards|Coach|Seasons|Years|Record|Pct.}}\n|-\n| ''No coach'' || 9 || 1882\u20131890 || 35\u201329\u20134 || .544\n|-\n| [[Wallace Moyle]] || 2 || 1891\u20131892 || 7\u201316\u20131 || .313\n|-\n| [[Pearl T.

Lafayette began their season by tying Princeton 0\u20130, the first tie in their series, and defeated the [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|University of West Virginia]] three times in three days by a combined score of 56\u20130.  At 4\u20130\u20131, Lafayette was set to meet [[Penn Quakers football|Pennsylvania]] on October 24 at Franklin Field. Penn, coached by [[George Washington Woodruff|George Woodruff]], was in the midst of a 34-game winning streak and was only guaranteeing Lafayette $150 for a game that would net $10,000.  As an intense media war surrounded the game, Lafayette enrolled [[Fielding H. Yost]], a tackle from West Virginia, whom Lafayette had defeated in the final game of their series on October 17. With Yost, College Football Hall of Famer [[Charles Rinehart|Charles \"Babe\" Rinehart]], and the inventor of the football helmet George 'Rose' Barclay on the field, Lafayette won 6\u20134. It was the first victory of a 'small school' over one of the Big Four (Harvard-Yale-Penn-Princeton). Penn would win its next 31 games. Lafayette closed its season with an 18\u20136 win over [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]]. Following the season, Lafayette was recognized as national champions along with Princeton (11\u20130\u20131) and was the first national champion outside of the H-Y-P-P rotation.  However, absent from their 1896 schedule was Lehigh, who protested the eligibility and amateur status of George Barclay who had played professional baseball at Chambersburg PA the previous summer.<ref name=\"March 1926 150\n\">{{cite book|last=March|first=Francis A.|title=Athletics at Lafayette College|year=1926|publisher=Lafayette College|location=Easton, PA|page=150}}</ref><ref name=\"Lewis 1982 23\">{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=S. Parnell|title=100 Years of Football at Lafayette College|year=1982|page=23}}</ref>\n\n;1921\nIn their final game, Lafayette defeated [[Lehigh University]] 28\u20136, prompting major papers such as the [[New York Herald]] to proclaim Lafayette to possess a share of the mythical title.  Lafayette was mentioned in the press along with the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|University of Iowa]] (7\u20130), which upset [[Knute Rockne]] and [[Notre Dame football|Notre Dame]] (10\u20131) to end a 20-game winning streak. Officially, the NCAA record book recognizes the [[California Golden Bears football|University of California]] (9\u20130\u20131), [[Cornell Big Red football|Cornell University]] (8\u20130), Lafayette, Iowa, and [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson]] (10\u20130\u20131) as champions, with only California, Cornell, and Lafayette claiming the title.\n\nAccording to Sutherland, Lafayette was approached by promoters to play a postseason game against a team from the west or southwest. Ultimately, Washington & Jefferson accepted an invitation to play California in the [[1922 Rose Bowl]].  Lafayette and the Presidents had three common opponents in 1921: Pittsburgh, [[Bucknell University]], and Lehigh. And both Lafayette and the Presidents won by nearly identical scores: Pittsburgh 6\u20130 vs. 7\u20130, Bucknell University 20\u20137 vs. 26\u20130, Lehigh 28\u20136 vs. 14\u20137. However, the policy of the athletic committee prohibited Lafayette from playing postseason games.  Sutherland was also hesitant to play any postseason games as well, citing the 1921 team had the same players as the \u2018mediocre\u2019 1920 team.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\" />\n\n;1926\nThe Maroon entered 1926 having narrowly missed winning the 1925 national championship.  The previous year, Lafayette defeated the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|University of Pittsburgh]] for the Panthers lone loss in a season where they would be crowned Eastern champions. However, Lafayette tied [[Colgate University]] 7\u20137 at Franklin Field and lost to [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson]] 7\u20136 at the [[Polo Grounds]].\n\nThe Leopards received a boost on opening day by inaugurating Lafayette Stadium. Their still unfinished stadium, which was soon to be known as [[Fisher Field]] and modeled after [[Harvard Stadium]], saw the Leopards defeat [[Muhlenberg University]] 35\u20130. Lafayette and Pittsburgh played another classic at [[Forbes Field]], a 17\u20137 Maroon victory. Entering their sixth game at 5\u20130 and averaging 34 points per game, Lafayette met Washington & Jefferson and legendary coach [[Andrew Kerr|Andy Kerr]] in what would soon become one of the greatest games in school history. Down 10\u20130 heading into halftime, [[Herb McCracken]] benched the entire starting 11 and had a starters-only closed-door meeting at halftime. The strategy worked, as Lafayette scored on the sixth play of the second half. Late in the fourth, down 10\u20139 and at their own 12 on third down, a fake punt handoff kept the drive alive.  After a long pass to the W&J 35, a reverse-lateral-forward pass put the Maroon on the four with seconds to play. Tuffy Guest punched in the winning score and sent the Presidents to their only loss in a 7\u20131\u20131 season.

The Field's west end was the site of the Easton City Dump. Fisher Field was made possible through a substantial donation by Thomas Fisher, Class of 1888, who almost single-handed raised the $445,000 for the Field's construction. The Field used to be known solely as Fisher Field until the 2006 season, when it was upgraded with FieldTurf, jogging track, new visitor stands, new bleacher seats, chairback seats, a video replay board, landscaping, lighting, press box, convenience stands, and the Bourger Varsity House.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goleopards.com/facilities/lafa-fisher.html|title=Page Redirection|author=|date=|website=www.goleopards.com|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}</ref> It acquired the name 'Fisher Stadium' to reflect the generosity of James Fisher, Class of 1977 (no relation), who donated a significant sum for the $23 million renovation. Fisher Field at Fisher Stadium is subsequently recognized as having one of the best FCS facilities in the country.\n\nPreviously, Fisher Field contained a six-lane running track and track and field competition areas adjacent to the playing surface.  The field was natural grass and a simple scoreboard at the west end of the stadium, which is the current location of the Bourger Varsity House. Additionally, the bleachers on the home side of the field were natural wood and thought to have been the original seats dating to the 1920s.  In the early 21st century, seating areas became dangerous as rotting wood seats and their loose screws were uncomfortable for spectators. The press box and coaches' boxes rested at the top of the grandstand and were constructed approximately in the 1950s, according to old photos. The visiting stands' dimension and capacity altered several times, with the last concrete grandstand being built in 1973 along with the construction of [[Kirby Sports Center|Allan P. Kirby Field House]].\n\n===March Field===\n[[File:March Field marker Lafayette College.JPG|thumb|245px|right|A marker currently stands between Farber and Ramer Hall dorms on March Field. None of the original structures remain, though the dimensions of the Field remain the same. DKE, Phi Psi, Ramer, Farber, Kunkel Hall, and portion of Hugel Hall occupy the former athletics grounds.]]March Field served as the primary venue from 1894 through 1925. The first organized athletic structure built at Lafayette was a small grandstand in front of Martien Hall (located on dormitory row, near the site of the current Kirby House), seating roughly 250 spectators.  The grandstand, built in 1890, was one of the first acts of the newly formed Alumni Advisory Committee. Though the grandstand was well received by the College at the time, the Alumni Advisory Committee wanted to establish a formal athletics grounds.\n\nThe site for the athletics grounds, which would be known as March Field, was identified as early as 1890.  \u201cThe ground lies on the historic Sullivan road, or as it is more commonly called, Lover\u2019s Lane, fronting 440 feet on that street, beginning  7 feet west of the reservoir, and extending southwest between parallel lines to the Bushkill Creek, and contains about 7 acres.\u201d<ref name=\"March 1926 272\"/>  Plans included a 440-yard circular track, 100-yard straight away track, baseball and football fields, grandstand, large bleachers, and carriage stand.  The entrance would be at the reservoir, which was at the time a reserve reservoir of the Easton Water Company.\n\nEngineers in the sophomore class surveyed the grounds in 1890, but financing was difficult. Originally anticipated to cost $2,000, the rocky subsurface on the upper half of the field and required grading on the lower half increased the cost to $3,000.  The [[Panic of 1893]], along with funds solicited mainly from the Alumni Advisory Committee members and alumni meetings, slowed progress on the field.  Professor Francis A. March Jr. enabled the field's completion in 1894 by writing an alumni fundraising letter and selling bonds on the field, with the new field's mortgage as collateral.\n\nThe field opened on June 19, 1894 with an all-Lafayette track meet that featured Olympic events, baseball throw, and tennis matches.  Before baseball and football games could be played, special soil had to be imported since the hard, clay soil was not suitable to grow grass. The first football game was hosted on October 3, with a 36\u20130 defeat of [[Gettysburg College]]. Ultimately, the cost of the field was $12,000.\n\nThe new field was soon unable to accommodate the athletics program. Since the football, baseball, and track configurations overlapped each other due the angle of the field and the reservoir, the Athletic Association had to spend money on contractors to build and disassemble the bleachers for each season.  The effort soon plunged the Alumni Advisory Committee into debt.  However, the Committee devised a permanent solution: purchase the reservoir, enlarge the grounds, and build a field house.  At commencement in 1904, the field house cornerstone was laid and work on the new field was completed towards the end of 1905 for a total cost of $9,000.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\"/>\n\n===The Quad===\nThe Quad is located in the center of Lafayette's campus and served as the venue of the first [[Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)|Lafayette-Lehigh]] in 1884 and other games through 1893. Baseball was also played on the Quad.  Sources from the period indicate that games were played on the level ground between McKeen Hall and college buildings to the south (known today as the Quad). Since football was a new sport and organized by the undergraduates, games were played on the open field in the central area of campus.  Small, but manageable crowds would attend the games, mostly consisting of students, alumni, and faculty.  Spectators stood or sat alongside the unenclosed field, while undergrads watched the games from their dormitories that flanked the Quad. Around 1888 and 1889, crowds at Lafayette football games began to surge.  Attempts were made to collect money for ticket revenues to offset the costs of athletic equipment, a trainer, and a training table.  Policemen would be stationed at the entrances of the College to enforce the new ticket policies, however, it was not difficult to avoid paying the small fee. Young boys and many citizens of Easton would easily gain admittance, with only alumni wishing to support the new, informal athletic association paid for tickets.  The need to raise revenue from ticket sales, as well as growing crowds, a few spectator incidents, and the persistent destruction of the Quad's grass, led to the formation of the Alumni Advisory Committee that soon raised funds for the new enclosed March Field.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\"/>\n\n==Tradition==\n\n===Nickname===\nThe Lafayette Student Council voted on the nickname \"Leopards\" since many other rival schools, such as Princeton, Pittsburgh, and Bucknell, had animal nicknames.  It is not clear why the nickname \"Leopards\" was selected, although it is reasonable to speculate that an 'L' nickname was ideal since other schools had animal nicknames that started with the school's first letter (Pittsburgh Panthers, Bucknell Bison).  The leopard was also selected because its 'cunning and physical strength, combined with the fact that it is irresistible when aroused, seemed to be typical of a Lafayette team.' The Leopard mascot made its debut against [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson]] at [[Yankee Stadium]] on October 25, 1924, a 20\u20136 Leopard victory.<ref name=\"Division I-AA All-Time Wins\"/>\n\n===Rivalries===\n\n====Lehigh====\n{{main|The Rivalry (Lafayette\u2013Lehigh)}}\n[[Lehigh Mountain Hawks football|Lehigh]] is Lafayette's primary rival and is the most played rivalry in college football (155 games as of the 2019 season). The rivalry is also the longest running annual college football series in the United States, with the two schools meeting every year since 1897.  Many publications, such as ESPN and Sports Illustrated, have dubbed the Lafayette-Lehigh rivalry as one of the most fierce and 'must-see' events in college football. The schools played twice annually from 1884 until 1902, with three games in 1891, one at a neutral site in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]. The schools also played two games annually during 1943 and 1944.\n\nThe series started in 1884 with Lehigh's first collegiate football game, a 56\u20130 loss in Easton. Lafayette dominated the series from the mid-1890s until 1949, including a 14\u20131 stretch from 1919 to 1933 and a 14\u20130\u20131 stretch from 1937 to 1949. From 1950 until 1980, Lehigh controlled the series as Lafayette won only eight games. The series regained competitive balance between 1981 and 1994, with no team winning more than two consecutive games. However, Lafayette's possible downgrade evaluation study of football in the late 1990s, along with Lehigh's rise as a Division I-AA power, led to seven consecutive Lehigh victories between 1995 and 2001. Since in 2002 and through 2010, the series has regained its competitive balance. The 150th (and most recent) game was held on November 22, 2014, and was attended by 48,256 people (the most attended of any Laf-Lehigh rivalry game). Lafayette emerged victorious with a score of 27\u20137.\n\nMany festivities, traditions, and pranks have surrounded 'The Rivalry' since the beginning. In recent years, the Patriot League Championship and FCS playoff berth have added a new dimension to the Rivalry and are often decided upon the outcome of the game.\n\nThe winner of the game is presented with the MVP trophy and the game ball. As of November 23, 2019, Lafayette leads 79\u201371\u20135.\n\n====Bucknell====\n[[Bucknell Bison football|Bucknell]] and Lafayette have met annually since 1945 have played 88 games (as of 2010) since the series began in 1883. Since the 1983 game, an outstanding player from each team is awarded the George McGaughey Memorial Award.  McGaughey was a star center on the 1933 Bucknell Orange Bowl team and was an athletic administrator at Lafayette for 32 years.\n\n====Penn====\nAlthough [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]] leads the all-time series 63\u201323\u20134, Lafayette has played Penn since the Leopards' first season in 1882. During the 1880s and 1890s, the two teams were a part of a fierce rivalry that often became boisterous and violent. Lafayette was awarded the 1896 national championship by ending Penn's 34-game winning streak in a 6\u20134 upset.\n\nDue to Lafayette's strong alumni base in Philadelphia, the large capacity of Franklin Field, and strong attendance at Penn football games, Lafayette has played a majority of its games against Penn at Franklin Field. From 1892 until 1973, which included only seven Lafayette victories, the two teams did not play a game on the Leopards' home field. The schools met for the 90th Game in 2013.\n\n===Defunct rivalries===\n\n====Rutgers====\nLafayette and [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers University]] played annually between 1921 and 1975. Along with Lehigh, Lafayette battled Rutgers for the Little Brass Cannon and the Middle Three Conference Championship. Through 1945, Lafayette went 27\u201314\u20131 against Rutgers but won only three games in the next 30 years to finish 30\u201341\u20131.\n\nLafayette's poor record and Rutgers increasing enrollment and dedication to major college football led to the end of the series. If not for the discontinuation of the rivalry in the 72nd meeting in 1975, the teams would be playing the 108th Game in 2011. As of 2011, there is a possibility that Rutgers and Lafayette will meet in a future season, contingent upon Lafayette instilling at least 57 football athletic scholarships or scholarship equivalencies.\n\nLafayette football played the first game in its history against Rutgers in 1882 and earned the program's first victory against Rutgers in 1883.\n\n====Washington & Jefferson====\nDuring the 1920s, Lafayette and [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson College]] battled for supremacy of the Eastern football. The two schools played many dramatic, close games before large crowds at neutral sites such as the [[Polo Grounds]], [[Yankee Stadium]], and [[Franklin Field]]. Both schools have the distinction of playing the first night indoor football game in history at [[Atlantic City Convention Hall|Atlantic City Boardwalk Hall]] in 1930, a 7\u20130 Presidents victory, as well as the first non-New York City college football teams to play a game in the Big Apple.\n\nWashington & Jefferson, due to its small size, gradually de-emphasized football in the face of the Depression and alleged impropriety in the program. The series ended in 1948, with a 12\u20139\u20132 Lafayette advantage.\n\n===Colors===\nAlthough Lafayette traditionally wears maroon and white, the team occasionally wears black jerseys and pants separately or together for important games.  Lafayette first wore black jerseys for their 2004 'conference championship' game against Lehigh, where the winner would secure an automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament.  The Leopards mainly wear their black uniforms at home, though there have been rare instances of black pants being combined with white jerseys on the road, such as the 2007 game at Lehigh.  \nThe 'invincibility' of the black jerseys on white pants combination ended with Lehigh's upset of Lafayette during their 2008 meeting.  The coaching staff makes a decision before the game on which jerseys to wear.\n\nThe Leopards wore gray pants with their white jerseys for their 2011 game at Lehigh along with gray numbered and striped helmets.  It was the first time gray was sported in a Lafayette uniform for many years.\n\n==Individual Honors==\nThe Leopards have placed 13 players on the All-American team, two of which earned the distinction twice. Due to the division of college football between FBS (I-A) and FCS (I-AA), Lafayette's All-Americans are divided between different eras.\n\nAlthough Lafayette earned many All-America team selections from various publications, especially in the early half of the 20th century, the Leopards' major college football All-Americans are considered consensus selections by receiving the majority of votes at their respective position by the NCAA Football Records book.  Its FCS era selections were named first-team All-Americans by a variety of recognized publications.\n\n===Major college football First-Team All-Americans===\n* [[Walter Ellsworth Bachman, Sr.|Walter E.

In addition to being a standout player for the Leopards, Kirby was a dedicated alumnus who supported the program and was a recognized figure in the world of college football.  In 2000, he received the Gold Medal Award from the [[National Football Foundation]] and was a member of the NFF from its founding in 1958 and was a board member until his death in 2011.

A majority of the Leopards who played in the NFL were members of the early league, when Lafayette was a major college football power and possessed some of the top talent in the country.\n\nCurrently, Lafayette's only active NFL player is [[Blake Costanzo]] '06, who is a special teams player for the Chicago Bears.  Costanzo has established himself as one of the most tenacious and intense special teams and tackling players in the NFL, as reflected by his nickname 'Psycho.'  Costanzo had a career year in 2011 with the [[San Francisco 49ers]], garnering the second most tackles on special teams and helping the 49ers to an upset win of the [[New Orleans Saints]] with a forced fumble and fumble recovery.  He was named as an alternate to the [[Pro Bowl]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Biggs|first=Brad|title=Bears sign veteran linebacker Blake Costanzo|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-13/sports/chi-bears-sign-veteran-linebacker-blake-costanzo-20120313_1_bears-sign-veteran-veteran-linebacker-brad-seely|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nCostanzo was named to [[Sports Illustrated]]'s All-Pro team on special teams while playing with the [[Cleveland Browns]].

The Maroons are best known for their role in the well documented and infamous [[1925 NFL Championship controversy]].  Four players on the famous 1925 squad played for Lafayette:  [[Charlie Berry]], [[Jack Ernst]], [[Joe Mahrefka]], and [[Bob Millman]].  Berry played the largest role on the team, leading the NFL in scoring with 74 points and kicked the game-winning field goal against the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|University of Notre Dame]] All-Stars, the game which caused the NFL Championship controversy.

Welles.  A member of the class of 1884, Welles brought football to Easton after learning the new game at Wilkes Barre Academy and Princeton University, where he studied as a college freshman.  H.R. Craven, who played and learned the sport at the [[Lawrenceville School]], served as the first team captain. Early football at Lafayette was not organized. In 1880 and 1881, students competed against each other on campus.  However, in the fall of 1882, Lafayette traveled to Rutgers to partake in its first intercollegiate football contest. On November 7, 1882, Lafayette fell to Rutgers 0-0/8-3.  One week later, Lafayette lost its second game ever against the [[Penn Quakers football|University of Pennsylvania]] 0-0/1-3.  Although official records reflect only two games being played in 1882, Welles mentions playing [[Swarthmore College]] and the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] on College Hill, winning both contests.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\">{{cite book|last=March|first=Francis A.|title=Athletics at Lafayette College|year=1926|publisher=Lafayette College|location=Easton, PA|page=37}}</ref>\n\n[[File:General Peyton March.jpg|thumb|left|250px| General [[Peyton C. March]], Class of 1884, the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|U.S. Army Chief of Staff]] following World War I, was a fullback on Lafayette's first football team. He is the son of [[Francis A. March]], who originated the study of English in academia.]]With one season of intercollegiate football experience, Lafayette won its first game ever in 1883. After dropping its first three games to Princeton, Pennsylvania, and Stevens, Lafayette broke through against Rutgers on November 10.  With four inches of slushy snow covering the Quad, Lafayette avenged the previous year's defeat 25\u20130 with four touchdowns despite a water-logged ball.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\"/>\n\nThe first game of 1884 brought a new team to Lafayette's schedule: [[Lehigh University]]. Located in nearby Bethlehem, Lehigh would be playing its first football game. With experience and superior skill on its side, Lafayette annihilated Lehigh 56\u20130 in what would shortly become known as [[Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)|\"The Rivalry\"]]. Due to the proximity of the schools, Lafayette played a Lehigh as their last opponent in 1884, winning 36\u20130 in Bethlehem. True animosity soon developed between both teams. In 1886, Lafayette was winning 12\u20130 until a severe downpour halted play 15 minutes into the second half (in 1886, there were two 45 minute halves). Both team captains mutually agreed to end the game even though football tradition called for football to be played in all weather.  The game's referee wrote [[Walter Camp]] on how to resolve the game. Camp said that the game should be declared a tie, but Lehigh acknowledged they were outplayed and gave Lafayette the victory.  Later in the season, with the game scoreless late in the second half, Lehigh was protesting the officiating of the game. As the Lehigh captain pulled his team off the field in protest, Lafayette picked up the ball and scored a touchdown. To this day, Lafayette counts the game as a 4\u20130 win, while Lehigh considers the game scoreless. The schools would play each other twice per season until 1902.<ref name=\"Davidson and Donchez 1997 268\">{{cite book|last=Davidson and Donchez|first=Todd and Bob|title=Legends of Lehigh \u2013 Lafayette|year=1997|publisher=D&D Publishing Company|location=Bethlehem, PA|isbn=0-9640341-1-5|page=268}}</ref>\n\nA bitter rivalry also emerged with Pennsylvania. During their annual contest on the Lafayette Quad on November 6, 1889, Lafayette's right tackle Wells, who had been ejected by the umpire earlier in the contest, tripped a Pennsylvania player running with the ball along the sidelines.  As the two players converged following the trip, a crowd of spectators surged the Penn player and \"struck, kicked, and generally misused him.\" Many outside newspapers trumped up the incident to make it seem like a mob had severely beaten the Penn player and there was general unruliness at the Lafayette game.  However, since it was the late 19th century, it is possible that the account of the unruly mob was an instance of [[yellow journalism]]. Additionally, the umpire who ejected Wells, Dr. Shell, was from the University of Pennsylvania and was cited in the newspaper for making several bad calls against Lafayette, including negating a five-point field goal on a phantom offside. Regardless, Pennsylvania was upset about the altercation relations between the two schools were strained. The incident was a key catalyst in forming the Alumni Advisory Committee in January 1890. Pennsylvania played only two more times at Lafayette, in 1891 and 1893, until 1973.<ref name=\"Davidson and Donchez 1997 268\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=November 14, 1889|url=http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=21299&REC=17|work=The Lafayette|publisher=Lafayette College|accessdate=March 24, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813071209/http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Fnewspaper&CISOPTR=21299&REC=17|archive-date=August 13, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAlthough there were no formal conferences, Lafayette, Lehigh, and Pennsylvania were loosely affiliated and their games, two against each opponent, were considered the battle for the Pennsylvania State Championship\n\n===College football upstart (1891\u20131918)===\nAfter being managed by students, Lafayette hired its first paid football coach for the 1891 season, W.S. Moyle.  Moyle was hired from [[Yale Bulldogs football|Yale University]] since he was familiar with the Yale system and was considered a good player. His stipend was $400.  As coach from 1891 to 1892, Moyle played in nearly every game and carried the ball on nearly every down.  He was lauded as a football hero until the faculty disapproved of his playing.  However, he was regarded as 'good coach' who 'taught for the first time what teamwork was.'<ref name=\"March 1926 272\"/>\n\nDespite hiring coaches, Lafayette's record had a losing record each season. Between 1891 and 1894, Lafayette went 2\u20139 against Lehigh, including two losses and a neutral site loss before 3,000 spectators in Wilkes-Barre in 1891.\n\nIn 1895, the alumni athletic advisors hired who would become a legendary college football figure, [[Parke H. Davis]].  Writing a history of Lafayette Athletics in 1926, [[Francis A. March, Jr.]] said, \"With the advent of Davis, little Lafayette stepped from comparative obscurity to a level with the football giants.\" Davis, who played at Princeton, was the first coach hired based on experience, having coached [[Amherst College]] and the [[Wisconsin Badgers football|University of Wisconsin]] in previous seasons.  Lafayette went 6\u20132 and had its first winning season since 1888 swept Lehigh for the first time since 1886. Davis is credited with bringing organization, recognition, and enthusiasm to Lafayette football through his charismatic personality and writing college fight songs. In 1896, Lafayette won its first [[List of college football national champions|National Championship]],<ref name=\"March 1926 272\"/>  which featured a dramatic 6\u20134 win against Pennsylvania at Franklin Field.\n\n[[File:LafayettePennFootballOct23.1896.jpg|thumb|right|400px| Lafayette holds Penn on defense in the 1896 \"National Championship game\" at Franklin Field on October 24. Lafayette won in a 6\u20134 upset, the only loss for Penn in a 66-game stretch. Two Lafayette players are wearing the first football helmet, one of them being inventor George \"Rose\" Barclay.]]\n\nDavis coached one more season, a 9\u20132\u20131 campaign in 1897.  [[Samuel B. Newton]], who arrived after coaching [[Penn State Nittany Lions football|Penn State]] led Lafayette to its most victories ever with a 12\u20131 record in 1899, with a lone 12\u20130 defeat to national champions Princeton (12\u20131) and outscoring opponents 253\u201323. Newton was 7\u20130 against Lehigh and 33\u201314 overall through his last season of 1902 before leaving Lafayette to coach Lehigh. In four games against Lafayette, Newton only won twice while going 23\u201320\u20132 overall. During this time, Newton coached [[Walter Ellsworth Bachman, Sr.|Walter E. Bachman]], who developed the roving center concept in football.  Bachman was named second-team All-American by Walter Camp in 1900 and 1901, one of the first players outside of the 'Big Four' to earn the honor.<ref name=\"Lewis 1982 23\"/>\n\nThe legendary roll of Lafayette coaches continued after the departure of Newton.  Dr. [[Alfred E. Bull]] coached between 1903 and 1907, compiling a 37\u201310\u20133 record in five seasons, with one loss to Lehigh. Tragically, Lafayette football hero and helmet inventor George \"Rose\" Barclay, who became coach in 1908 and was the first Lafayette player to coach the team, died following after one season after suffering from an appendicitis. His successor, [[Bob Folwell]], became one of the most decorated coaches in Lafayette history by posting a 19\u20132\u20131 record.  Folwell led the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|University of Iowa]] to its first conference championship and after Lafayette, led [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson College]] to be recognized as 'an elite power team,' along with [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]], [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]], the [[University of Chicago]], and [[Yale Bulldogs football|Yale]]. In 1925, he became the first coach of the [[New York Giants]].\n\nFolwell coached Lafayette to its first win against [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton]] on October 23, 1909 in what the New York Times said was, \"the most sensational finish that has ever been seen in a football game.\" With six second remaining and the score 0\u20130, Princeton was set to attempt a game-winning field goal from the Lafayette 10-yard line. Irmschler blitzed through the tackle and guard, caught the ball as it left the kicker's foot, and raced 92-yards for the win as time expired for a 6\u20130 win.  The team was greeted with a jubilant crowd that paraded through Easton and College Hill when the team returned.<ref>{{cite news|title=Princeton Beaten in Last Minute|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/10/24/106777689.pdf|work=New York Times|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=April 2, 2011|date=October 24, 1909}}</ref> In their next game two weeks later, Lafayette tied Pennsylvania 6\u20136 and ultimately finished second behind Yale (10\u20130\u20130) in the East and for the national championship. Lafayette outscored the opposition 176\u20136.\n\nFolwell left in the middle of the 1911 season with Lafayette holding a 5\u20130 record. It came at an inopportune moment as Lafayette was set to host the [[Carlisle Indians]] and [[Jim Thorpe]].  Lafayette lost 19\u20130 and went 2\u20133 the rest of the season under S.B. Newton.<ref name=\"LaBella\">{{cite web|last=LaBella|first=Phil|title=2010 Lafayette Leopards Media Guide|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/lafa/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2010_FBmediaguide_LR.pdf|work=Lafayette Athletics|publisher=Lafayette Department of Athletics|accessdate=April 2, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===National college football power (1919\u20131948)===\nBetween 1921 and 1948, Lafayette was considered one of the premiere college football programs.  The team earned two national championships, had four undefeated seasons, featured several All-Americans, played in major games, and was involved in several bowl scenarios.  During nearly every season of the era, the team was led by a coach that would later be inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]].\n\n====The 1920s====\n[[File:Sutherland Lafayette College coach.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Jock Sutherland coached Lafayette from 1919\u20131923. He is considered one of the greatest coaches of all-time and was 33\u20138\u20132 on College Hill. He ranks fourth in Lafayette winning percentage.]] The hiring of [[Jock Sutherland]] in 1919 started Lafayette on the road to national prominence during the 1920s. After coaching an undefeated team at an Army base in Georgia during World War I and only a few years removed from playing for the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|University of Pittsburgh]] and [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]], Sutherland was prepared to enter a career in dentistry.  However, a chance meeting with a friend propelled Sutherland to take a coaching job at Lafayette.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\" /> \n    \nLafayette finished 1919 at 6\u20132 and 5\u20133 the following season.  According to Sutherland, with virtually the same team as 1920, Lafayette went 9\u20130 in 1921 and went on a 17-game winning streak that stretched between 1920 and 1922, where Lafayette outscored opponents 495\u201347, with wins over major teams such as Penn, coached by [[John Heisman]], Pittsburgh (twice), [[Fordham Rams football|Fordham University]], and [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]]. During the national championship season of 1921, no team came within three touchdowns of Lafayette except Pittsburgh, coached by Pop Warner.  Late in the game, Lafayette used a triple pass and touchdown by \u2018Bots\u2019 Brunner near the Pitt goal line to gain a 6\u20130 lead.  Pitt was inside the Lafayette ten with under two minutes to play, but an illegal substitution by Pitt cost the Panthers dearly and Lafayette held on for the win.<ref name=\"Lewis 1982 23\" />\n\nSix games into the 1922 season, Lafayette was poised to claim another national championship.  The Maroon defeated Pittsburgh at [[Forbes Field]], the only loss of the season for a 10\u20131 team that claimed a 'post-season' victory at Stanford. Facing the [[1922 Rose Bowl]] participant [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson]] before 38,000 at the [[Polo Grounds]] in New York City, Lafayette took a commanding 13\u20130 halftime lead.  However, a dramatic and miraculous comeback by the Presidents resulted in a 14\u201313 Maroon defeat, one of the most bitter in Lafayette football history.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\" />\n\nSutherland coached the Maroon until 1923, when he returned to his alma mater, Pittsburgh, for the 1924 season. New coach [[Herb McCracken]], also a recent player under [[Glenn Scobey Warner|Pop Warner]], quickly proved himself by defeating Sutherland at Pittsburgh 10\u20130 in the second game of the season.  McCracken won his first five games before falling to [[Penn Quakers football|Pennsylvania]] 6\u20133. Before the game, McCracken discovered that Penn had decoded Lafayette's play-calling signals.  McCracken responded with a new and innovative solution: the [[huddle]]. Although McCracken is often credited as the inventor of the huddle, there are earlier, though some less substantiated claims of other schools implementing the huddle only a few years earlier.<ref name=\"Nytimes.com\"/><ref>{{cite web|last=Edmonston Jr.|first=George|title=Part 20 of 20: The Tractor That Could and Other Interesting OSU Firsts|url=http://www.osualum.com/s/359/index.aspx?sid=359&gid=1&pgid=361|work=Oregon State Alumni Association|publisher=Oregon State University|accessdate=July 25, 2011}}</ref>\n\nAt the start of the 1926 season, Lafayette inaugurated its new, unfinished 18,000 seat stadium with a 35\u20130 win over [[Muhlenberg College]].  The Maroon continued to win by dominate scores en route to their third national championship on the back of All-American halfback [[George Wilson (American football halfback)|Mike \u201cGeorge\u201d Wilson]], who led the nation in scoring with 120 points and 20 touchdowns, a national record at the time.  The Maroon also led the East in scoring, with 328 points, and only surrendered 37 points in nine games.

In 1929, Lafayette joined with Lehigh and Rutgers to form the [[Middle Three Conference]], which consisted of round-robin games between the two teams.  The schools split the first year of the series at 1\u20131\u20130 each. Lafayette won their first Middle Three title the following season.\n\n====The 1930s====\nLafayette made college football history on October 25, 1930, when the Leopards and [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson]] played the first night indoor college football game in history at the [[Boardwalk Hall|Atlantic City Boardwalk Hall]] before 25,000.  The Presidents won 7\u20130 on an easy touchdown within the two-yard line with the help of a play that is illegal today \u2013 a recovered \u201cfumble\u201d by pushing a Lafayette defender into the kicker and the ball.  In their final game of the season, Lafayette defeated Lehigh 16\u20136 before 20,000 at Fisher Field, the largest crowd to witness [[Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)|\"The Rivalry\"]] at the time.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lafayette Files Protest|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1930/10/29/102181565.pdf|accessdate=August 5, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 28, 1930}}</ref>\n\nAfter a 7\u20132 season in 1931, Lafayette\u2019s record began to decline.  Coach [[Herb McCracken]] had only won less than five games once since his first season in 1924, but did not win more than three games through his final season at Lafayette in 1935. Although he was only 36 at the time, McCracken retired from coaching to help friend Maurice Robinson start-up [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic Publications]] and write a popular magazine, Scholastic Coach.<ref name=\"Nytimes.com\"/>\n\nTo return the Leopards to the spotlight, Lafayette called on [[Ernie Nevers]], an assistant coach at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]] who helped lead the Indians to three straight [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] games. Nevers, along with [[Jim Thorpe]], was considered one of the two best college football players ever and had a legendary career in the early [[NFL]]. Hope was high on College Hill as the 1935 freshman team went undefeated against the leading freshmen teams of the East, including Princeton.<ref>{{cite news|title=Nevers Named Lafayette Coach from Field of 100 Aspirants|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1936/01/18/88626245.pdf|accessdate=August 5, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 17, 1936}}</ref>  However, with a young team plagued by injuries, the Leopards went 1\u20138, their worst record since their first season of football in 1882, and were blown out in their last five games. Despite stating he would stay for the 1937 season, Nevers resigned to become an assistant coach at the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|University of Iowa]].\n\nAbsent a coach for the second straight season, Lafayette turned to [[Edward Mylin|Edward \u201cHook\u201d Mylin]], the inaugural [[Orange Bowl]] winning head coach of [[Bucknell University]]. In one of the most remarkable turnarounds in college football at the time, the 1\u20138 Leopards of 1936 went 8\u20130 in 1937.  Furthermore, the Leopards posted seven shutouts, outscored opponents 130\u20136, and featured an unscored upon defense, including a 13\u20130 win over heavily favored [[New York University]] at Yankee Stadium.  The key win featured a key 79-yard punt by quarterback Tommy Kearns and a 50-yard and 30-yard touchdown pass.

With a narrow 9\u20137 win over [[New York University]] in their second game and missing several injured players, Lafayette carried a 4\u20130 record into their meeting with [[Army Black Knights football|Army]] at [[West Point]]. The team was suddenly awakened at 4 a.m. as the Cadets, cavalrymen, and horses paraded in front of the team hotel in an attempt to rattle the Leopards. It was also an important date at West Point since a visiting delegation of South American generals would be reviewing the cadets before the game. Army advanced deep into Lafayette territory early in the first quarter, but a missed field goal and key stops kept the Leopards in the game. Zirinsky scored in the third for a 6\u20130 lead, a spread formation newly unveiled by Mylin helped Lafayette to a 12\u20130 lead. A 70-yard interception return by Zirinsky in the final minute sealed Lafayette\u2019s 19\u20130 win.  Despite injuries and facing many Army substitutes, Lafayette outgained Army 184\u2013104. The following week, Army fell to [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] 7\u20130 on a returned interception, leading many writers to compare Lafayette to Notre Dame.  As of 2011, the 1940 victory over Army is Lafayette\u2019s only victory in 20 meetings.<ref name=\"Lewis 1982 23\" />\n\nTwo weeks later, Lafayette edged [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers University]] by an extra point 7\u20136 in New Brunswick before 20,000.

Drafted by the [[Cleveland Rams]] in 1942, Zirinsky played in only the 1945 season.<ref name=\"LaBella\"/>\n\nWorld War II soon impacted the Leopard football as many players and coaches became enlisted men, including Mylin. Lafayette went 3\u20135\u20131 in 1942, including a 19\u201313 win over the [[Virginia Cavaliers football|University of Virginia]] at Fisher Field and coming up one-yard short against Lehigh in the final seconds of a 7\u20137 tie.  In 1943 and 1944, Lafayette continued to play football as other colleges suspended their programs such as nearby [[Moravian College]], the former team of new Leopard coach [[Ben Wolfson]].  Unlike Harvard and Yale, Lafayette and Lehigh continued their rivalry, playing each other twice, as well as Rutgers twice and one game against nearby Willow Grove Naval Air Station.<ref name=\"LaBella\"/> Only 5,000 attended the game in Easton, and 3,500 in Taylor Stadium, both Lafayette routs and devoid of bands or cheerleaders. In 1944, Lafayette expanded their schedule to include \u2018local\u2019 trips to [[Syracuse Orangemen football|Syracuse University]] and NYU, as well as two games against Rutgers and Lehigh. Only 300 fans attended the first game against Lehigh in a rainstorm.  Lafayette romped in the finale 64\u20130, their largest margin of victory in the series, to finish 6\u20131.<ref name=\"Davidson and Donchez 1997 268\" />\n\nBetween 1945 and 1946, Lafayette won three games, including two shutouts over Lehigh.

Lafayette accepted the bid contingent upon being able to bring [[David Showell]], an African-American halfback and former [[Tuskegee Airmen|Tuskegee Airman]].  Texas law at the time prohibited African-Americans from playing on the same field as Caucasian players in a state-supported stadium. Showell\u2019s team members also did not want to accept the bid unless Showell could accompany the team to El Paso. The Chairman of the Sun Bowl, C.D.

The Athletic Department did not issue a reason for the rejection, prompting a protest of 1,500 students and a bonfire.  The students marched on the President\u2019s house, demanding an explanation. President Ralph Cooper Hutchison explained the situation and along with student leaders, phoned the Bowl Committee chairman to reconsider.  Upon a prompt rejection by Belding, the student protest marched downtown and received an audience at the local radio station.

Lafayette gradually de-emphasized football with the inauguration of alumnus [[Ralph Cooper Hutchinson]] as president of the College.  At [[Washington & Jefferson College]], where he had been president from 1931 to 1945, Hutchinson had presided over the de-emphasis of the [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Presidents]] national profile in light of improper payments to players.  Additionally, with the rise of state universities through the influx of returning servicemen and state funding, Lafayette and other small private schools were at a competitive disadvantage in financial support and recruiting. During this era, Lafayette defeated Lehigh only eight times out of 31 games and Rutgers only three times through the cessation of the rivalry in 1975.\n\nFollowing the departure of [[Ivy Williamson|Ivan Williamson]] to the [[Wisconsin Badgers football|University of Wisconsin]], [[Maurice J. \"Clipper\" Smith]], who lost only two games as the coach of [[Villanova Wildcats football|Villanova]], only won four games between 1949 and 1951. However, he led the 1\u20136 Leopards to a 21\u201312 win over a 6\u20132 Lehigh team in 1949.  Lafayette was losing 12\u20130 at halftime before a ferocious comeback gave the Leopards their seventh straight win over Lehigh and as of 2011, is the largest upset (record-wise) by the Leopards in the series to date.  Lehigh rebounded the next year for their first win since 1936 and go undefeated for the first time in their history.\n\n[[Steve Hokuf]] took over as head coach in 1952 and led the Leopards to their first winless season since the program's first year in 1882.  However, Lafayette rebounded and won three straight games against Lehigh through 1955, their last three-game winning streak until 2004\u20132006.  The 1955 season was also one of the best of the era as the 6\u20132 Leopards scored two upset wins.  Traveling to [[Dartmouth Big Green football|Dartmouth College]] as a 13-point underdog, Lafayette scored a 21\u201313 win for their first win over an [[Ivy League]] team since a 1923 win over [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]].<ref name=\"Lewis 1982 23\" /> Several weeks later, Lafayette defeated Rutgers 16\u20137 and Lehigh in the last week of the season to capture their last outright Middle Three Conference championship. Lafayette won six games in 1956 and would not win as many games until going 7\u20132 in 1968.\n\nLafayette and Lehigh made college football history in 1964.  Both schools met in Easton for the 100th edition of [[Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)|\"The Rivalry\"]] before a sold-out crowd and national media attention.  Ironically, it was one of the worst ever match-ups of the Rivalry as Lafayette was winless and Lehigh had one win.  The game fared no better as the schools played to a 6\u20136 tie, and both schools missed an extra point.\n\nLafayette soon hired [[Harry Gamble]], who would achieve later prominence as a coach at Penn and president of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].  Gamble was the only coach between [[Edward Mylin|Edward \u201cHook\u201d Mylin]] and [[Bill Russo (American football)|Bill Russo]] to have a winning record as coach of the Leopards.  In his second season in 1968, Gamble led Lafayette to their best record since 1948 with a 7\u20133 mark.  The team had a three and four-game winning streak and was ranked first in the Lambert Cup poll as the best team in the east, but was upset at home by a two-win Lehigh team, 21\u201316.  Wide receiver Mike Miller was named to the honorable mention 'Little' All-American team, the first time since 1940 any Lafayette player was mentioned on an All-American list.  Gamble also went 2\u20132 against Lehigh, the best record of any coach from the era.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nThe end of the Gamble era in the early 1970s saw the emergence of running back Tony Giglio, who would become one of the most prolific rushers in Lafayette history.  Giglio amassed 2,519 yards and 22 touchdowns in only three seasons, including a 238-yard outburst in a 19-point loss at Colgate.  Giglio was named third-team All-America by the Associated Press in 1973, the first Leopard team placement since legendary rusher [[George Wilson (American football halfback)|Mike \u201cGeorge\u201d Wilson]] in 1926.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nLafayette continued to struggle on the field, never winning more than five games until 1981.  In 1971, the Leopards scored an upset win over Penn in Gamble's first season as the Quaker's coach.  The 17\u201315 at Franklin Field was the first Lafayette win over Penn since 1923. The season also featured the Leopards last ever win (as of 2011) over Rutgers.\n\nDespite mediocre records of three and five win seasons, the Lafayette student newspaper editorialized in 1975 that the program was in a 25-year demise between 1949 and 1975 and was being dominated by teams which the paper considered football 'powers.' Between 1960 and 1974, Lafayette went 10\u201356\u20131 against Bucknell, Colgate, Delaware, Lehigh, Penn, and Rutgers.  Citing poor morale on campus and the administration's unwillingness to commit to improving the program and attributing losing to a 'temporary down cycle', the paper editorialized, \"Let's get rid of Colgate and yes, even Lehigh.  Both schools have moved onto higher football plateaus... the Engineers are actively seeking greater things for their program, while Lafayette only seems to be striving for mediocrity.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Abt|first=Lee|title=The \"25 Year 'Slump\"|url=http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=4679&CISOSHOW=4669&REC=10|accessdate=December 3, 2011|newspaper=The Lafayette|date=November 21, 1975|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406075351/http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Fnewspaper&CISOPTR=4679&CISOSHOW=4669&REC=10|archive-date=April 6, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>   The rivalry with Rutgers ended that season as the Leopards were blown out in their last three meetings.\n\nLafayette managed a 21\u201317 upset of Lehigh in 1976, but finished no better than .500 or defeated Lehigh through the remainder of Neil Putman's tenure in 1980.\n\n===Resurgence and Rebirth under Russo (1981\u20131996)===\n{{very long section|date=December 2018}}\nWith the hiring of [[Bill Russo (American football)|Bill Russo]], Lafayette football completed an unheralded rebirth and ushered in an era of explosive offensive. Through Russo's first 16 seasons, the Leopards finished below .500 only three times. In the preceding 30 years, the Leopards only had ten winning seasons and won more than six games five times.\n\nRusso quickly asserted his new style by winning the first five games of the season, a first since 1956, and entered the season finale against Lehigh with an identical 8\u20132 record. Despite being huge underdogs against the Lambert Cup leading Engineers, the Leopards relied upon their defense to spring a 10\u20133 upset at Taylor Stadium. Even though Lafayette finished with one more win than Lehigh and played a near identical schedule, Lafayette was denied a bid to the Division I-AA playoffs and finished fourth in the Lambert Cup poll. As of 2012, the 1981 game, along with 2004, is the highest combined win total for each school entering the season finale.\n\nSuccess continued under Russo as the Leopards defeated Lehigh for a second straight year and won seven games. The era also saw the inaugural season of the Colonial League in 1986, which later became known as the [[Patriot League]].\n\nAfter beating Lehigh in 1984 and 1986, the Leopards finally won their first Colonial League championship in 1988 with an 8\u20132\u20131 mark.  In the second game of 1988, Lafayette scored a monumental 28\u201320 upset over [[Holy Cross Crusaders football|Holy Cross]].  The previous season, Holy Cross finished 11\u20130 and No. 1 in the final 1987 NCAA Division I-AA poll and its best player [[Gordie Lockbaum]], finished third in the [[Heisman Trophy]] voting. With another win in 1992, Lafayette was the only Patriot League team to defeat Holy Cross between its dominant run against Eastern football between 1986 and 1993.\n\nThe 1988 season was one of the best in Lafayette history and witnessed the emergence of its best quarterback ever, Frank Baur.  Baur smashed and rewrote nearly every Lafayette offensive and passing record with a cannon arm. In the 1988 season, he led the nation in passing efficiency at 64% and led the Leopards to finish as the second-ranked offense. He finished his career with 8,399 yards and 62 touchdowns, which stood until 2003.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nBaur also achieved fame by being the only Lafayette and Patriot League athlete, as well as one of only a few non-BCS collegiate athletes, to appear on the cover of [[Sports Illustrated]]. He appeared on the cover of the September 4, 1989 college football preview and was projected to be one of the first three quarterbacks taken in the 1990 NFL Draft, along with [[Troy Aikman]] and [[Steve Walsh (American football)|Steve Walsh]]. After being selected the [[Hula Bowl]] following his senior season, Baur was drafted but later cut by the New York Giants.<ref>{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Bruce|title=AT THE PIANO OR AT QUARTERBACK, FRANK BAUR OF LAFAYETTE GIVES A VIRTUOSO PERFORMANCE|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1068753/index.htm|work=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=February 1, 2012|date=September 4, 1989}}</ref>\n\nThe 1988 team also featured Lafayette's record-breaking running back and wide receiver up to that time. As a freshman, Tom Costello ran for 1132 yards and later grabbed the record from Giglio with 1,397 yards in 1989. Phillip Ng served as Baur's primary target and raked in 13 touchdowns and 1,048 yards. His touchdown mark still stands as the most in Leopards history and was the first Leopard to catch over 1,000 yards in a season.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nWith the Colonial League championship up for grabs, the 1988 [[The Rivalry (Lehigh\u2013Lafayette)|Lafayette-Lehigh]] meeting surpassed all hype. Lafayette rolled to a 52\u201345 win in an explosive game, where both teams passed for over 300 yards by halftime and broke many Rivalry records that still stand today.\n\nRusso was also acknowledged following the 1988 season by winning the Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year award, which is presented to the best coach in Division I-AA.\n\nLafayette won the Patriot League championship for the second time in 1992 and was the only school aside from Holy Cross to win the league championship at the time.  At 8\u20133, Lafayette finished the season on a six-game winning streak and lost two games each by three points.  During the season, Erik Marsh burst onto the scene and became the most prolific rusher in Lafayette football history.  He rushed for 1,365 yards as a sophomore to set the record, only to break his own mark with 1,441 the next season.  The record still stands today and is one of the highest single season totals in Patriot League history.  During the 1992 season, Tom Kirchoff also established records as one of the most efficient quarterbacks in Lafayette history.  Ranking only second to Baur at the time, Kirchoff threw for 26 touchdowns and nine interceptions, the best spread ever in a single season.  His 26 touchdowns stood as a Lafayette record until 2009.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nDespite the loss of Kirchoff to graduation, Lafayette's offense continued to excel with Marsh through 1994.  The running back essentially had a player's average career season against Lehigh alone, rushing for over 800 yards in four games against the Engineers, including 251 yards in 1992 and 249 yards in 1993.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nThe 1994 season was arguably one of the most bizarre yet triumphant season's in Lafayette football history despite finishing with a 5\u20136 record.  After losing their first six games of the season, including five losses by more than two touchdowns, the Leopards went on to win their last five games of the season to capture their third Patriot League championship. In their five wins, Lafayette allowed only more than two touchdowns once, with the only exception being a 56\u201320 drubbing of Lehigh.<ref name=LaBella />\n\n===The \"Study\" Years (1997\u20131999)===\nDespite decades of rich tradition, Lafayette nearly dropped its football program from Division I to Division III or outright cancelled the program.  As early as 1996, athletics director Eve Atkinson made proposals to de-emphasize portions of the department.  Poor overall performance, interdepartmental budget conflicts, and issues with coach-recommended athletes competing in the admissions pool were factors cited for all athletics programs as a reason for downgrading to Division III.<ref>{{cite news|last=Chiger and Dorsch|first=Stephen and Steve|title=Significant changes to Lafayette sports proposed|url=http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=32163&CISOSHOW=32149&REC=1|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708080254/http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=32163&CISOSHOW=32149&REC=1|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 8, 2012|accessdate=February 3, 2012|newspaper=The Lafayette|date=October 30, 1998}}</ref> Several faculty argued that football should be eliminated to achieve budget savings and that the sport should not be a focus of the student body.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abels|first=James|title=Committee examines D-I to D-III Switch|url=http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=37216&CISOSHOW=37204&REC=6|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714194048/http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=37216&CISOSHOW=37204&REC=6|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 14, 2012|accessdate=February 3, 2012|newspaper=The Lafayette|date=December 11, 1998}}</ref> The trustees ultimately voted to remain Division I and continue football.<ref>{{cite news|last=Julin|first=Matt|title=Campus considers athletics decision|url=http://cdm.lafayette.edu/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/newspaper&CISOPTR=34749&CISOSHOW=34741&REC=7|accessdate=February 3, 2012|newspaper=The Lafayette|date=January 29, 1999}}{{Dead link|date=February 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nConsiderable damage was done to the program during the period.  Prospective recruits would not consider Lafayette based upon rumor of a downgrade or elimination of football, and current players transferred. Russo's teams, which had only four losing seasons in his first 15 years and did not win less than four games once, went a combined 10\u201323 in the next three seasons.  Miraculously, Russo's teams contested Lehigh closely during the era, including a two-point loss to an undefeated Lehigh squad in his final game in 1999.\n\n===Frank Tavani era (2000\u20132016)===\n{{very long section|date=December 2018}}\n[[Frank Tavani]] was named head coach following the retirement of Russo in December 1999.  Tavani had been a coach on Russo's staff since 1986 and was most recently the associate head coach.  Challenges confronted the program at every angle: the recent study to disband or de-emphasize the program had left Lafayette in a disadvantaged position on the recruiting trail.  Also, the success of Lehigh reaching double-digit wins and playoff berths each season since 1998, coupled with aged facilities, placed Lafayette in the shadow of its regional rival.  However, Tavani's vision helped revitalize the program within five seasons and led to three consecutive championships and playoff appearances, nine winning seasons, national rankings, and a string of four consecutive victories over Lehigh.\n\nThe tide began to turn with the arrival of quarterback Marko Glavic in Tavani's first season.  The Canadian native was initially recruited to [[Bowling Green University]], but offensive coordinator [[Mike Faragalli]]'s move to Lafayette prompted Bowling Green to rescind Glavic's scholarship offer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Larimer|first=Terry|title=Lafayette's Tavani Glad To Get Glavic|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2000-03-23/sports/3286131_1_recruits-patriot-league-division|work=Morning Call|accessdate=February 11, 2012}}</ref>   Glavic, who won the [[Patriot League]] rookie of the year by throwing for 1,964 yards and 12 touchdowns, surpassed many of Baur's records and finished as Lafayette's all-time leading quarterback with 9,819 yards and tied Baur with 62 touchdowns.  Glavic was the all-time Patriot League passing leader until [[Dominic Randolph]] of Holy Cross surpassed the mark in 2008.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nLafayette continued to score recruiting gains with the arrival of running back Joe McCourt, the 2000 [[Philadelphia Inquirer]] player of the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lafayette Football Announces Class of 2005|url=http://www.goleopards.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/031201aaa.html|work=goleopards.com}}</ref>   Several key linemen were also recruited in 2001, and success continued in 2002 with many key defensive players that built Lafayette's title run, such as All-American linebacker Maurice Bennett and future NFL player [[Blake Costanzo]].\n\nLafayette won two games each in Tavani's first two seasons, but the Leopards surpassed all expectations in 2002 by going 7\u20135, tying for second place, and upsetting Lehigh 14\u20137.  The Mountain Hawks entered the season ranked as the nation's number one team and had beaten Lafayette for seven straight seasons.  With the score tied 7\u20137 in the fourth quarter, the Leopards engineered \"The Drive,\" a 19-play, nine-minute drive that resulted in Joe McCourt's winning touchdown dive.<ref name=LaBella />  However, \"The Drive's\" biggest play occurred on a fake field goal attempt.  Lafayette was set to kick a 58-yard field goal, but holder Mike O'Connor changed the play and scurried eight yards for a first down to keep the march alive.\n\nExpectations were high in 2003, but Lafayette went 5\u20136.  However, Glavic and McCourt contributed record-breaking efforts.  Glavic threw for a record 2,725 yards, while McCourt ran for 1,393 yards, the third most behind Marsh and Costello, and 15 touchdowns, the most since Nick Kowigos in 1982.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nDespite losing Glavic to graduation, many key players returned to the Leopards in 2004 and led Lafayette to its first ever postseason appearance and first Patriot League Championship since 1994.  The Leopards signaled their championship form with an upset 21\u201316 win over scholarship [[Richmond Spiders football|University of Richmond]] and a game saving tackle inside the one-yard line in a 14\u201313 win at Bucknell.  Quarterback Brad Maurer emerged as a dual run-and-pass threat for the Leopards by throwing and rushing for over 100 yards at Fordham, Tavani's first win over the Rams.  Lafayette entered their game as underdogs to Lehigh, ranked number eight in the polls, but the dual-threat ability of Maurer, McCourt's 23 carries, and a punishing defensive effort, propelled the Leopards to a 24\u201310 win.  The Leopards fell the following week to the [[Delaware Blue Hens football|University of Delaware]] when a game-tying touchdown drive was intercepted and returned for a score, but ended the season ranked 19 in two polls.  It was Lafayette's first ranking since the 1997 preseason.  McCourt finished the season with 16 touchdowns, tying Tom Costello in 1989 as second most behind [[George Wilson (American football halfback)|Mike \u201cGeorge\u201d Wilson]]'s 20 scores in 1926.  McCourt also finished his career second to Marsh with 4,474 yards and the 50 touchdowns, the most at Lafayette.  He also finished with the fifth most career receptions ever, 139, and ranks 11th in career receiving yards.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nSuccess continued into 2005 as Maurer and a stingy defense led the Leopards to a second consecutive Patriot League Championship season, playoff berth, and 8\u20134 record.  The Leopards entered their final game of the season at 12th ranked Lehigh needing a win to tie for the Patriot League championship and keep their slim playoff hopes alive.  On the first drive, Maurer was injured and replaced by back-up quarterback Pat Davis.  Though up 10\u20133 at halftime, Lafayette was down 19\u201317 in the fourth quarter.  With 38 seconds remaining and Lafayette facing its potential last play, Davis chucked a 37-yard touchdown strike to running back Jonathan Hurt, who managed to sneak behind the last defender at the five for the reception and skipped into the end-zone for the winning 23\u201319 score.  The play, known as \"The Big Hurt,\" is one of the most famous plays in the storied [[Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)|\"Rivalry\"]].  Future NFL San Francisco 49er Blake Costanzo terrorized Lehigh with three sacks.  Following the win, Lafayette was awarded an at-large berth into the NCAA playoffs, assisted by its 7\u20130 win over Richmond, a top 15 team, earlier in the season.  Though Lafayette fell to [[Appalachian State Mountaineers football|Appalachian State]], the eventual national champions, after being tied 20\u201320 entering the fourth quarter, the Leopards ended the season ranked in the top 25.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nLafayette earned its third consecutive trip to the NCAA Division I FCS Playoffs by clinching its third straight Patriot League Championship in 2006.  The championship run was second to only 1994 in terms of improbability.  After being ranked as high as 22 in week two, Lafayette lost its next five games.  At 2\u20135, the Leopards earned a momentum-changing win at Colgate, Tavani's first over.  Lafayette won its next three games, including what is known as the \"Shock and Awe\" game over Lehigh.  Lafayette scored 28 points in eight minutes during the first half and led 28\u201321 at halftime.  Lehigh cut the score to 28\u201327, but Lafayette scored 21 unanswered points in compiling 500 yards of offense.  Maurer and Hurt were named game co-MVPs, one of only two occasions that the award was shared.<ref name=LaBella />  The game was also characterized by many vicious Lafayette hits.\n\nThe 2006 season also witnessed the reopening of [[Fisher Field]].  During the off-season, the 80-year-old stadium underwent extensive renovations that included new bleachers, press box, scoreboard, FieldTurf, and a football varsity house complex, among many other additions.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nWinning seasons continued through 2009.  Lafayette defeated Lehigh for the fourth straight year in 2007, the first such string of Leopard victories since the 1943\u20131949 seasons. In 2008, Lafayette knocked-off 14th-ranked [[Liberty Flames football|Liberty University]] on their home field to end the nation's longest active home winning streak.  Led by quarterback Rob Curley, the Leopards had a record-breaking campaign in 2009.  After starting 1\u20131, Lafayette won seven straight games, their longest in-season winning streak since the 9\u20130 1940 squad.  The Leopards were also ranked 20th, the sixth straight season that they were in the top 25.  Curley also had a record campaign by being the only Lafayette quarterback to throw for over 3,000 yards in a season and finished with a Lafayette record 28 touchdowns.  He also threw for a record seven touchdowns in a wild 56\u201349 win over nationally ranked Colgate.  At 8\u20131, Lafayette lost their next two games and their chance at a league championship.  A two-point loss to eventual champion Holy Cross under controversial circumstances and an overtime upset loss at Lehigh kept the Leopards from their fourth playoff berth and title of the Tavani era.<ref name=LaBella />\n\nThe Leopards struggled in the 2010 and 2011 seasons as injuries, depth, and the loss of many key players had a tremendous impact on the team. On November 30, 2016, [[Frank Tavani]] left Lafayette after 30 years on staff and 40 years of coaching college football.<ref>https://www.lehighvalleylive.com/lafayette/index.ssf/2016/11/post_19.html</ref>\n\n=== John Garrett era (2016\u2013present) ===\nOn December 21, 2016, former NFL assistant and college football assistant coach [[John Garrett (American football)|John Garrett]] (brother of Head Coach Jason Garrett of the Dallas Cowboys) was named the new Lafayette head football coach.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.goleopards.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/113016aaa.html|title=Tavani Steps Down after 17 Seasons|access-date=December 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Conference affiliations==\nLafayette has been both an independent and affiliated with two conferences.<ref name=\"2018MG\" />{{rp|124\u2013132}}\n* Independent (1882\u20131985){{better citation|date=December 2018}}\n* [[Patriot League|Colonial League]] (1986\u20131989)\n* [[Patriot League]] (1990\u2013present)\n\n==Head coaches==\nThe following served as head coach at Lafayette.<ref name=\"2018MG\" />{{rp|123}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Lafayette Leopards|Coach|Seasons|Years|Record|Pct.}}\n|-\n| ''No coach'' || 9 || 1882\u20131890 || 35\u201329\u20134 || .544\n|-\n| [[Wallace Moyle]] || 2 || 1891\u20131892 || 7\u201316\u20131 || .313\n|-\n| [[Pearl T.

Lafayette began their season by tying Princeton 0\u20130, the first tie in their series, and defeated the [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|University of West Virginia]] three times in three days by a combined score of 56\u20130.  At 4\u20130\u20131, Lafayette was set to meet [[Penn Quakers football|Pennsylvania]] on October 24 at Franklin Field. Penn, coached by [[George Washington Woodruff|George Woodruff]], was in the midst of a 34-game winning streak and was only guaranteeing Lafayette $150 for a game that would net $10,000.  As an intense media war surrounded the game, Lafayette enrolled [[Fielding H. Yost]], a tackle from West Virginia, whom Lafayette had defeated in the final game of their series on October 17. With Yost, College Football Hall of Famer [[Charles Rinehart|Charles \"Babe\" Rinehart]], and the inventor of the football helmet George 'Rose' Barclay on the field, Lafayette won 6\u20134. It was the first victory of a 'small school' over one of the Big Four (Harvard-Yale-Penn-Princeton). Penn would win its next 31 games. Lafayette closed its season with an 18\u20136 win over [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy]]. Following the season, Lafayette was recognized as national champions along with Princeton (11\u20130\u20131) and was the first national champion outside of the H-Y-P-P rotation.  However, absent from their 1896 schedule was Lehigh, who protested the eligibility and amateur status of George Barclay who had played professional baseball at Chambersburg PA the previous summer.<ref name=\"March 1926 150\n\">{{cite book|last=March|first=Francis A.|title=Athletics at Lafayette College|year=1926|publisher=Lafayette College|location=Easton, PA|page=150}}</ref><ref name=\"Lewis 1982 23\">{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=S. Parnell|title=100 Years of Football at Lafayette College|year=1982|page=23}}</ref>\n\n;1921\nIn their final game, Lafayette defeated [[Lehigh University]] 28\u20136, prompting major papers such as the [[New York Herald]] to proclaim Lafayette to possess a share of the mythical title.  Lafayette was mentioned in the press along with the [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|University of Iowa]] (7\u20130), which upset [[Knute Rockne]] and [[Notre Dame football|Notre Dame]] (10\u20131) to end a 20-game winning streak. Officially, the NCAA record book recognizes the [[California Golden Bears football|University of California]] (9\u20130\u20131), [[Cornell Big Red football|Cornell University]] (8\u20130), Lafayette, Iowa, and [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson]] (10\u20130\u20131) as champions, with only California, Cornell, and Lafayette claiming the title.\n\nAccording to Sutherland, Lafayette was approached by promoters to play a postseason game against a team from the west or southwest. Ultimately, Washington & Jefferson accepted an invitation to play California in the [[1922 Rose Bowl]].  Lafayette and the Presidents had three common opponents in 1921: Pittsburgh, [[Bucknell University]], and Lehigh. And both Lafayette and the Presidents won by nearly identical scores: Pittsburgh 6\u20130 vs. 7\u20130, Bucknell University 20\u20137 vs. 26\u20130, Lehigh 28\u20136 vs. 14\u20137. However, the policy of the athletic committee prohibited Lafayette from playing postseason games.  Sutherland was also hesitant to play any postseason games as well, citing the 1921 team had the same players as the \u2018mediocre\u2019 1920 team.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\" />\n\n;1926\nThe Maroon entered 1926 having narrowly missed winning the 1925 national championship.  The previous year, Lafayette defeated the [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|University of Pittsburgh]] for the Panthers lone loss in a season where they would be crowned Eastern champions. However, Lafayette tied [[Colgate University]] 7\u20137 at Franklin Field and lost to [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson]] 7\u20136 at the [[Polo Grounds]].\n\nThe Leopards received a boost on opening day by inaugurating Lafayette Stadium. Their still unfinished stadium, which was soon to be known as [[Fisher Field]] and modeled after [[Harvard Stadium]], saw the Leopards defeat [[Muhlenberg University]] 35\u20130. Lafayette and Pittsburgh played another classic at [[Forbes Field]], a 17\u20137 Maroon victory. Entering their sixth game at 5\u20130 and averaging 34 points per game, Lafayette met Washington & Jefferson and legendary coach [[Andrew Kerr|Andy Kerr]] in what would soon become one of the greatest games in school history. Down 10\u20130 heading into halftime, [[Herb McCracken]] benched the entire starting 11 and had a starters-only closed-door meeting at halftime. The strategy worked, as Lafayette scored on the sixth play of the second half. Late in the fourth, down 10\u20139 and at their own 12 on third down, a fake punt handoff kept the drive alive.  After a long pass to the W&J 35, a reverse-lateral-forward pass put the Maroon on the four with seconds to play. Tuffy Guest punched in the winning score and sent the Presidents to their only loss in a 7\u20131\u20131 season. McCracken called the victory the most dramatic, spirited and determined of his career, while sportswriters dubbed the game among the top ten they had witnessed.<ref name=\"Lewis 1982 23\" />\n\nLafayette did not surrender a point the rest of the season and scored the least number of points in a 35\u20130 win over Lehigh.  Following the season and the nation\u2019s leading scorer [[George Wilson (American football halfback)|Mike \u201cGeorge\u201d Wilson]]\u2019s exploits, Lafayette was crowned Eastern champion.  The Associated Press also crowned Lafayette as the national 5-year champion, ahead of Michigan, Notre Dame, and the selected [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]] participant Alabama.<ref>{{cite news|last=Associated Press|title=Lafayette Elevens Hold 5-Year Record|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1926/12/03/118877614.pdf|accessdate=August 7, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 3, 1926}}</ref>\n\n===Conference championships===\nLafayette has won seven conference championships.<ref name=\"2018MG\" />{{rp|124\u2013132}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=Lafayette Leopards|Year|Conference|Coach|Overall record|Conference record}}\n|-\n| 1988 || [[Patriot League|Colonial League]] || [[Bill Russo (American football)|Bill Russo]] || 8\u20132\u20131 || 5\u20130\n|-\n| 1992 || [[Patriot League]] || Bill Russo || 8\u20133 || 5\u20130\n|-\n| 1994 || Patriot League || Bill Russo || 5\u20136 || 5\u20130\n|-\n| [[2004 Lafayette Leopards football team|2004]] || Patriot League || [[Frank Tavani]] || 8\u20134 || 5\u20131 \n|-\n| [[2005 Lafayette Leopards football team|2005]] || Patriot League || Frank Tavani || 8\u20134 || 5\u20131\n|-\n| [[2006 Lafayette Leopards football team|2006]] || Patriot League || Frank Tavani || 6\u20136 || 5\u20131 \n|-\n| [[2013 Lafayette Leopards football team|2013]] || Patriot League || Frank Tavani || 5\u20137 || 4\u20131 \n|-\n|}\n\n==Division I-AA/FCS Playoffs results==\nThe Leopards have appeared in the I-AA/FCS playoffs four times with an overall record of 0\u20134.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Field's west end was the site of the Easton City Dump. Fisher Field was made possible through a substantial donation by Thomas Fisher, Class of 1888, who almost single-handed raised the $445,000 for the Field's construction. The Field used to be known solely as Fisher Field until the 2006 season, when it was upgraded with FieldTurf, jogging track, new visitor stands, new bleacher seats, chairback seats, a video replay board, landscaping, lighting, press box, convenience stands, and the Bourger Varsity House.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goleopards.com/facilities/lafa-fisher.html|title=Page Redirection|author=|date=|website=www.goleopards.com|accessdate=April 11, 2018}}</ref> It acquired the name 'Fisher Stadium' to reflect the generosity of James Fisher, Class of 1977 (no relation), who donated a significant sum for the $23 million renovation. Fisher Field at Fisher Stadium is subsequently recognized as having one of the best FCS facilities in the country.\n\nPreviously, Fisher Field contained a six-lane running track and track and field competition areas adjacent to the playing surface.  The field was natural grass and a simple scoreboard at the west end of the stadium, which is the current location of the Bourger Varsity House. Additionally, the bleachers on the home side of the field were natural wood and thought to have been the original seats dating to the 1920s.  In the early 21st century, seating areas became dangerous as rotting wood seats and their loose screws were uncomfortable for spectators. The press box and coaches' boxes rested at the top of the grandstand and were constructed approximately in the 1950s, according to old photos. The visiting stands' dimension and capacity altered several times, with the last concrete grandstand being built in 1973 along with the construction of [[Kirby Sports Center|Allan P. Kirby Field House]].\n\n===March Field===\n[[File:March Field marker Lafayette College.JPG|thumb|245px|right|A marker currently stands between Farber and Ramer Hall dorms on March Field. None of the original structures remain, though the dimensions of the Field remain the same. DKE, Phi Psi, Ramer, Farber, Kunkel Hall, and portion of Hugel Hall occupy the former athletics grounds.]]March Field served as the primary venue from 1894 through 1925. The first organized athletic structure built at Lafayette was a small grandstand in front of Martien Hall (located on dormitory row, near the site of the current Kirby House), seating roughly 250 spectators.  The grandstand, built in 1890, was one of the first acts of the newly formed Alumni Advisory Committee. Though the grandstand was well received by the College at the time, the Alumni Advisory Committee wanted to establish a formal athletics grounds.\n\nThe site for the athletics grounds, which would be known as March Field, was identified as early as 1890.  \u201cThe ground lies on the historic Sullivan road, or as it is more commonly called, Lover\u2019s Lane, fronting 440 feet on that street, beginning  7 feet west of the reservoir, and extending southwest between parallel lines to the Bushkill Creek, and contains about 7 acres.\u201d<ref name=\"March 1926 272\"/>  Plans included a 440-yard circular track, 100-yard straight away track, baseball and football fields, grandstand, large bleachers, and carriage stand.  The entrance would be at the reservoir, which was at the time a reserve reservoir of the Easton Water Company.\n\nEngineers in the sophomore class surveyed the grounds in 1890, but financing was difficult. Originally anticipated to cost $2,000, the rocky subsurface on the upper half of the field and required grading on the lower half increased the cost to $3,000.  The [[Panic of 1893]], along with funds solicited mainly from the Alumni Advisory Committee members and alumni meetings, slowed progress on the field.  Professor Francis A. March Jr. enabled the field\u2019s completion in 1894 by writing an alumni fundraising letter and selling bonds on the field, with the new field\u2019s mortgage as collateral.\n\nThe field opened on June 19, 1894 with an all-Lafayette track meet that featured Olympic events, baseball throw, and tennis matches.  Before baseball and football games could be played, special soil had to be imported since the hard, clay soil was not suitable to grow grass. The first football game was hosted on October 3, with a 36\u20130 defeat of [[Gettysburg College]]. Ultimately, the cost of the field was $12,000.\n\nThe new field was soon unable to accommodate the athletics program. Since the football, baseball, and track configurations overlapped each other due the angle of the field and the reservoir, the Athletic Association had to spend money on contractors to build and disassemble the bleachers for each season.  The effort soon plunged the Alumni Advisory Committee into debt.  However, the Committee devised a permanent solution: purchase the reservoir, enlarge the grounds, and build a field house.  At commencement in 1904, the field house cornerstone was laid and work on the new field was completed towards the end of 1905 for a total cost of $9,000.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\"/>\n\n===The Quad===\nThe Quad is located in the center of Lafayette's campus and served as the venue of the first [[Lehigh-Lafayette football games (The Rivalry)|Lafayette-Lehigh]] in 1884 and other games through 1893. Baseball was also played on the Quad.  Sources from the period indicate that games were played on the level ground between McKeen Hall and college buildings to the south (known today as the Quad). Since football was a new sport and organized by the undergraduates, games were played on the open field in the central area of campus.  Small, but manageable crowds would attend the games, mostly consisting of students, alumni, and faculty.  Spectators stood or sat alongside the unenclosed field, while undergrads watched the games from their dormitories that flanked the Quad. Around 1888 and 1889, crowds at Lafayette football games began to surge.  Attempts were made to collect money for ticket revenues to offset the costs of athletic equipment, a trainer, and a training table.  Policemen would be stationed at the entrances of the College to enforce the new ticket policies, however, it was not difficult to avoid paying the small fee. Young boys and many citizens of Easton would easily gain admittance, with only alumni wishing to support the new, informal athletic association paid for tickets.  The need to raise revenue from ticket sales, as well as growing crowds, a few spectator incidents, and the persistent destruction of the Quad's grass, led to the formation of the Alumni Advisory Committee that soon raised funds for the new enclosed March Field.<ref name=\"March 1926 272\"/>\n\n==Tradition==\n\n===Nickname===\nThe Lafayette Student Council voted on the nickname \"Leopards\" since many other rival schools, such as Princeton, Pittsburgh, and Bucknell, had animal nicknames.  It is not clear why the nickname \"Leopards\" was selected, although it is reasonable to speculate that an 'L' nickname was ideal since other schools had animal nicknames that started with the school's first letter (Pittsburgh Panthers, Bucknell Bison).  The leopard was also selected because its 'cunning and physical strength, combined with the fact that it is irresistible when aroused, seemed to be typical of a Lafayette team.' The Leopard mascot made its debut against [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson]] at [[Yankee Stadium]] on October 25, 1924, a 20\u20136 Leopard victory.<ref name=\"Division I-AA All-Time Wins\"/>\n\n===Rivalries===\n\n====Lehigh====\n{{main|The Rivalry (Lafayette\u2013Lehigh)}}\n[[Lehigh Mountain Hawks football|Lehigh]] is Lafayette's primary rival and is the most played rivalry in college football (155 games as of the 2019 season). The rivalry is also the longest running annual college football series in the United States, with the two schools meeting every year since 1897.  Many publications, such as ESPN and Sports Illustrated, have dubbed the Lafayette-Lehigh rivalry as one of the most fierce and 'must-see' events in college football. The schools played twice annually from 1884 until 1902, with three games in 1891, one at a neutral site in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania]]. The schools also played two games annually during 1943 and 1944.\n\nThe series started in 1884 with Lehigh's first collegiate football game, a 56\u20130 loss in Easton. Lafayette dominated the series from the mid-1890s until 1949, including a 14\u20131 stretch from 1919 to 1933 and a 14\u20130\u20131 stretch from 1937 to 1949. From 1950 until 1980, Lehigh controlled the series as Lafayette won only eight games. The series regained competitive balance between 1981 and 1994, with no team winning more than two consecutive games. However, Lafayette's possible downgrade evaluation study of football in the late 1990s, along with Lehigh's rise as a Division I-AA power, led to seven consecutive Lehigh victories between 1995 and 2001. Since in 2002 and through 2010, the series has regained its competitive balance. The 150th (and most recent) game was held on November 22, 2014, and was attended by 48,256 people (the most attended of any Laf-Lehigh rivalry game). Lafayette emerged victorious with a score of 27\u20137.\n\nMany festivities, traditions, and pranks have surrounded 'The Rivalry' since the beginning. In recent years, the Patriot League Championship and FCS playoff berth have added a new dimension to the Rivalry and are often decided upon the outcome of the game.\n\nThe winner of the game is presented with the MVP trophy and the game ball. As of November 23, 2019, Lafayette leads 79\u201371\u20135.\n\n====Bucknell====\n[[Bucknell Bison football|Bucknell]] and Lafayette have met annually since 1945 have played 88 games (as of 2010) since the series began in 1883. Since the 1983 game, an outstanding player from each team is awarded the George McGaughey Memorial Award.  McGaughey was a star center on the 1933 Bucknell Orange Bowl team and was an athletic administrator at Lafayette for 32 years.\n\n====Penn====\nAlthough [[Penn Quakers football|Penn]] leads the all-time series 63\u201323\u20134, Lafayette has played Penn since the Leopards' first season in 1882. During the 1880s and 1890s, the two teams were a part of a fierce rivalry that often became boisterous and violent. Lafayette was awarded the 1896 national championship by ending Penn's 34-game winning streak in a 6\u20134 upset.\n\nDue to Lafayette's strong alumni base in Philadelphia, the large capacity of Franklin Field, and strong attendance at Penn football games, Lafayette has played a majority of its games against Penn at Franklin Field. From 1892 until 1973, which included only seven Lafayette victories, the two teams did not play a game on the Leopards' home field. The schools met for the 90th Game in 2013.\n\n===Defunct rivalries===\n\n====Rutgers====\nLafayette and [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers University]] played annually between 1921 and 1975. Along with Lehigh, Lafayette battled Rutgers for the Little Brass Cannon and the Middle Three Conference Championship. Through 1945, Lafayette went 27\u201314\u20131 against Rutgers but won only three games in the next 30 years to finish 30\u201341\u20131.\n\nLafayette's poor record and Rutgers increasing enrollment and dedication to major college football led to the end of the series. If not for the discontinuation of the rivalry in the 72nd meeting in 1975, the teams would be playing the 108th Game in 2011. As of 2011, there is a possibility that Rutgers and Lafayette will meet in a future season, contingent upon Lafayette instilling at least 57 football athletic scholarships or scholarship equivalencies.\n\nLafayette football played the first game in its history against Rutgers in 1882 and earned the program's first victory against Rutgers in 1883.\n\n====Washington & Jefferson====\nDuring the 1920s, Lafayette and [[Washington & Jefferson Presidents football|Washington & Jefferson College]] battled for supremacy of the Eastern football. The two schools played many dramatic, close games before large crowds at neutral sites such as the [[Polo Grounds]], [[Yankee Stadium]], and [[Franklin Field]]. Both schools have the distinction of playing the first night indoor football game in history at [[Atlantic City Convention Hall|Atlantic City Boardwalk Hall]] in 1930, a 7\u20130 Presidents victory, as well as the first non-New York City college football teams to play a game in the Big Apple.\n\nWashington & Jefferson, due to its small size, gradually de-emphasized football in the face of the Depression and alleged impropriety in the program. The series ended in 1948, with a 12\u20139\u20132 Lafayette advantage.\n\n===Colors===\nAlthough Lafayette traditionally wears maroon and white, the team occasionally wears black jerseys and pants separately or together for important games.  Lafayette first wore black jerseys for their 2004 'conference championship' game against Lehigh, where the winner would secure an automatic berth into the NCAA Tournament.  The Leopards mainly wear their black uniforms at home, though there have been rare instances of black pants being combined with white jerseys on the road, such as the 2007 game at Lehigh.  \nThe 'invincibility' of the black jerseys on white pants combination ended with Lehigh's upset of Lafayette during their 2008 meeting.  The coaching staff makes a decision before the game on which jerseys to wear.\n\nThe Leopards wore gray pants with their white jerseys for their 2011 game at Lehigh along with gray numbered and striped helmets.  It was the first time gray was sported in a Lafayette uniform for many years.\n\n==Individual Honors==\nThe Leopards have placed 13 players on the All-American team, two of which earned the distinction twice. Due to the division of college football between FBS (I-A) and FCS (I-AA), Lafayette's All-Americans are divided between different eras.\n\nAlthough Lafayette earned many All-America team selections from various publications, especially in the early half of the 20th century, the Leopards' major college football All-Americans are considered consensus selections by receiving the majority of votes at their respective position by the NCAA Football Records book.  Its FCS era selections were named first-team All-Americans by a variety of recognized publications.\n\n===Major college football First-Team All-Americans===\n* [[Walter Ellsworth Bachman, Sr.|Walter E.

In addition to being a standout player for the Leopards, Kirby was a dedicated alumnus who supported the program and was a recognized figure in the world of college football.  In 2000, he received the Gold Medal Award from the [[National Football Foundation]] and was a member of the NFF from its founding in 1958 and was a board member until his death in 2011.

A majority of the Leopards who played in the NFL were members of the early league, when Lafayette was a major college football power and possessed some of the top talent in the country.\n\nCurrently, Lafayette's only active NFL player is [[Blake Costanzo]] '06, who is a special teams player for the Chicago Bears.  Costanzo has established himself as one of the most tenacious and intense special teams and tackling players in the NFL, as reflected by his nickname 'Psycho.'  Costanzo had a career year in 2011 with the [[San Francisco 49ers]], garnering the second most tackles on special teams and helping the 49ers to an upset win of the [[New Orleans Saints]] with a forced fumble and fumble recovery.  He was named as an alternate to the [[Pro Bowl]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Biggs|first=Brad|title=Bears sign veteran linebacker Blake Costanzo|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-03-13/sports/chi-bears-sign-veteran-linebacker-blake-costanzo-20120313_1_bears-sign-veteran-veteran-linebacker-brad-seely|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}</ref>\n\nCostanzo was named to [[Sports Illustrated]]'s All-Pro team on special teams while playing with the [[Cleveland Browns]].

The Maroons are best known for their role in the well documented and infamous [[1925 NFL Championship controversy]].  Four players on the famous 1925 squad played for Lafayette:  [[Charlie Berry]], [[Jack Ernst]], [[Joe Mahrefka]], and [[Bob Millman]].  Berry played the largest role on the team, leading the NFL in scoring with 74 points and kicked the game-winning field goal against the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|University of Notre Dame]] All-Stars, the game which caused the NFL Championship controversy.  Berry's field goal was arguably one of the most famous moments in the early NFL since college football was considered superior to the NFL and Notre Dame featured the famed [[Four Horsemen (American football)|Four Horsemen]].

{"title_page": "Discrete-time Fourier transform", "text_new": "{{distinguish|text=the [[discrete Fourier transform]]}}\n{{short description|Fourier analysis technique applied to sequences}}\n{{Fourier transforms}}\n\nIn [[mathematics]], the '''discrete-time Fourier transform''' ('''DTFT''') is a form of [[Fourier analysis]] that is applicable to a sequence of values.\n\nThe DTFT is often used to analyze samples of a continuous function.  The term ''discrete-time'' refers to the fact that the transform operates on discrete data, often samples whose interval has units of time.  From uniformly spaced samples it produces a function of frequency that is a [[periodic summation]] of the [[continuous Fourier transform]] of the original continuous function.  Under certain theoretical conditions, described by the [[sampling theorem]], the original continuous function can be recovered perfectly from the DTFT and thus from the original discrete samples.  The DTFT itself is a continuous function of frequency, but discrete samples of it can be readily calculated via the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) (see {{slink|#Sampling the DTFT}}), which is by far the most common method of modern Fourier analysis.\n\nBoth transforms are invertible.  The inverse DTFT is the original sampled data sequence.  The inverse DFT is a periodic summation of the original sequence.  The [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) is an algorithm for computing one cycle of the DFT, and its inverse produces one cycle of the inverse DFT.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe discrete-time Fourier transform of a discrete set of real or complex numbers {{math|''x''[''n'']}}, for all [[Number#Integers|integers]] {{mvar|n}}, is a [[Fourier series]], which produces a periodic function of a frequency variable.

When the sequence is shifted into a ''DFT data window'', {{nowrap|[0 \u2264 n \u2264 2M],}} the DTFT is multiplied by a complex-valued phase function:  <math>e^{-i2\\pi f M}</math>.  But when sampled at frequencies <math>f = k/2M,</math> for integer values of <math>k,</math> the samples are all real-valued.  To achieve that goal, we can perform a <math>2M</math>-length DFT on a periodic summation with 1-sample of overlap. Specifically, the last sample of a data sequence is deleted and its value added to the first sample.  Then a window function, shortened by 1 sample, is applied, and the DFT is performed.

Therefore, the case {{math|''L'' < ''N''}} is often referred to as '''zero-padding'''.\n\nSpectral leakage, which increases as {{mvar|L}} decreases, is detrimental to certain important performance metrics, such as resolution of multiple frequency components and the amount of noise measured by each DTFT sample.  But those things don't always matter, for instance when the {{math|''x''[''n'']}} sequence is a noiseless sinusoid (or a constant), shaped by a window function.  Then it is a common practice to use ''zero-padding'' to graphically display and compare the detailed leakage patterns of window functions.

Also visible in '''Fig 2''' is the spectral leakage pattern of the {{math|''L'' {{=}} 64}} rectangular window.  The illusion in '''Fig 3''' is a result of sampling the DTFT at just its zero-crossings.  Rather than the DTFT of a finite-length sequence, it gives the impression of an infinitely long sinusoidal sequence.  Contributing factors to the illusion are the use of a rectangular window, and the choice of a frequency (1/8 = 8/64) with exactly 8 (an integer) cycles per 64 samples.  A [[Window function#Hann window|Hann window]] would produce a similar result, except the peak would be widened to 3 samples (see [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DFT-even_Hann_window_&_spectral_leakage.png DFT-even Hann window]).\n\n== Convolution ==\nThe [[convolution theorem]] for sequences is''':'''{{efn-la\n|[[#refOppenheim|Oppenheim and Schafer]], p 60, eq 2.169.\n}}\n\n:<math>x * y\\ =\\ \\scriptstyle \\text{DTFT}^{-1} \\displaystyle \\left[\\scriptstyle \\text{DTFT} \\displaystyle \\{x\\}\\cdot \\scriptstyle \\text{DTFT} \\displaystyle \\{y\\}\\right].</math>\n\nAn important special case is the [[circular convolution]] of sequences {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} defined by <math>x_{_N}*y,</math> where <math>x_{_N}</math> is a periodic summation.

The term ''discrete-time'' refers to the fact that the transform operates on discrete data, often samples whose interval has units of time.  From uniformly spaced samples it produces a function of frequency that is a [[periodic summation]] of the [[continuous Fourier transform]] of the original continuous function.  Under certain theoretical conditions, described by the [[sampling theorem]], the original continuous function can be recovered perfectly from the DTFT and thus from the original discrete samples.  The DTFT itself is a continuous function of frequency, but discrete samples of it can be readily calculated via the [[discrete Fourier transform]] (DFT) (see {{slink|#Sampling the DTFT}}), which is by far the most common method of modern Fourier analysis.\n\nBoth transforms are invertible.  The inverse DTFT is the original sampled data sequence.  The inverse DFT is a periodic summation of the original sequence.  The [[fast Fourier transform]] (FFT) is an algorithm for computing one cycle of the DFT, and its inverse produces one cycle of the inverse DFT.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe discrete-time Fourier transform of a discrete set of real or complex numbers {{math|''x''[''n'']}}, for all [[Number#Integers|integers]] {{mvar|n}}, is a [[Fourier series]], which produces a periodic function of a frequency variable.  When the frequency variable, \u03c9, has [[Normalized frequency (digital signal processing)|normalized units]] of ''radians/sample'', the periodicity is {{math|2\u03c0}}, and the Fourier series is''':'''<ref name=Oppenheim/>\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =\n|title=\n|equation = {{NumBlk|:|<math>X_{2\\pi}(\\omega) = \\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} x[n] \\,e^{-i \\omega n}.</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.1}}}}\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour=#F5FFFA}}\n\nThe utility of this frequency domain function is rooted in the [[Poisson summation formula]].  Let {{math|''X''(''f'')}} be the Fourier transform of any function, {{math|''x''(''t'')}}, whose samples at some interval {{mvar|T}} (''seconds'') are equal (or proportional) to the {{math|''x''[''n'']}} sequence, i.e. {{math|''T''\u22c5''x''(''nT'') {{=}} ''x''[''n'']}}.  Then the periodic function represented by the Fourier series is a periodic summation of {{math|''X''(''f'')}} in terms of frequency {{mvar|f}} in [[hertz]] (''cycles/sec'')''':'''{{efn-la\n|[[#refOppenheim|Oppenheim and Schafer]], p 147 (4.20) and p 694 (10.1), where: &nbsp;<math>T\\cdot X(e^{i\\omega}) \\triangleq X_{2\\pi}(\\omega),</math> &nbsp; <math>\\omega \\triangleq 2\\pi f T,</math>&nbsp; and &nbsp;<math>X_c(i 2\\pi f) \\triangleq X(f).</math>\n}}\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>\nX_{1/T}(f) = X_{2\\pi}(2\\pi f T)\\ \\triangleq\n\\sum_{n=-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\underbrace{T\\cdot x(nT)}_{x[n]}\\ e^{-i 2\\pi f T n}\\;\n\\stackrel{\\mathrm{Poisson\\;f.}}{=} \\;\n \\sum_{k=-\\infty}^{\\infty} X\\left(f - k/T\\right).\n</math>|{{EquationRef|Eq.2}}}}\n\n[[File:Fourier transform, Fourier series, DTFT, DFT.svg|thumb|400px|Fig 1.

The lower right corner depicts samples of the DTFT that are computed by a discrete Fourier transform (DFT).]]\n\nThe integer {{mvar|k}} has units of ''cycles/sample'', and {{math|1/''T''}} is the sample-rate, {{mvar|f<sub>s</sub>}} (''samples/sec'').  So {{math|''X''<sub>1/''T''</sub>(''f'')}} comprises exact copies of {{math|''X''(''f'')}} that are shifted by multiples of {{mvar|f<sub>s</sub>}} hertz and combined by addition. For sufficiently large {{mvar|f<sub>s</sub>}} the {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}} term can be observed in the region {{math|[\u2212''f<sub>s</sub>/2, f<sub>s</sub>/2'']}} with little or no distortion ([[aliasing]]) from the other terms.  In Fig.1, the extremities of the distribution in the upper left corner are masked by aliasing in the periodic summation (lower left).\n\nWe also note that {{math|''e''<sup>\u2212''i2\u03c0fTn''</sup>}} is the Fourier transform of {{math|''\u03b4''(''t'' \u2212 ''nT'')}}.

When the sequence is shifted into a ''DFT data window'', {{nowrap|[0 \u2264 n \u2264 2M],}} the DTFT is multiplied by a complex-valued phase function:  <math>e^{-i2\\pi f M}</math>.  But when sampled at frequencies <math>f = k/2M,</math> for integer values of <math>k,</math> the samples are all real-valued.  To achieve that goal, we can perform a <math>2M</math>-length DFT on a periodic summation with 1-sample of overlap. Specifically, the last sample of a data sequence is deleted and its value added to the first sample.  Then a window function, shortened by 1 sample, is applied, and the DFT is performed.  The shortened, even-length window function is sometimes called [[Window_function#DFT-even|DFT-even]].{{efn-ua\n|When the 2M+1 sequence is truncated, instead of overlapped, the DTFT changes, usually by a small amount.

Therefore, the case {{math|''L'' < ''N''}} is often referred to as '''zero-padding'''.\n\nSpectral leakage, which increases as {{mvar|L}} decreases, is detrimental to certain important performance metrics, such as resolution of multiple frequency components and the amount of noise measured by each DTFT sample.  But those things don't always matter, for instance when the {{math|''x''[''n'']}} sequence is a noiseless sinusoid (or a constant), shaped by a window function.  Then it is a common practice to use ''zero-padding'' to graphically display and compare the detailed leakage patterns of window functions.  To illustrate that for a rectangular window, consider the sequence:\n\n:<math>x[n] = e^{i 2\\pi \\frac{1}{8} n},\\quad </math> and <math>L=64.</math>\n\n'''Figures 2 and 3''' are plots of the magnitude of two different sized DFTs, as indicated in their labels.

Also visible in '''Fig 2''' is the spectral leakage pattern of the {{math|''L'' {{=}} 64}} rectangular window.  The illusion in '''Fig 3''' is a result of sampling the DTFT at just its zero-crossings.  Rather than the DTFT of a finite-length sequence, it gives the impression of an infinitely long sinusoidal sequence.  Contributing factors to the illusion are the use of a rectangular window, and the choice of a frequency (1/8 = 8/64) with exactly 8 (an integer) cycles per 64 samples.  A [[Window function#Hann window|Hann window]] would produce a similar result, except the peak would be widened to 3 samples (see [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:DFT-even_Hann_window_&_spectral_leakage.png DFT-even Hann window]).\n\n== Convolution ==\nThe [[convolution theorem]] for sequences is''':'''{{efn-la\n|[[#refOppenheim|Oppenheim and Schafer]], p 60, eq 2.169.\n}}\n\n:<math>x * y\\ =\\ \\scriptstyle \\text{DTFT}^{-1} \\displaystyle \\left[\\scriptstyle \\text{DTFT} \\displaystyle \\{x\\}\\cdot \\scriptstyle \\text{DTFT} \\displaystyle \\{y\\}\\right].</math>\n\nAn important special case is the [[circular convolution]] of sequences {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|y}} defined by <math>x_{_N}*y,</math> where <math>x_{_N}</math> is a periodic summation.

Following his time at Caltech, Van Essen then moved to Washington University in St. Louis in 1992, where he served as the Head of the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology for two decades. His earlier research included studies of simpler systems, including [[synapse]] elimination at the [[neuromuscular junction]]. Van Essen has hypothesized that tension along axons and dendrites accounts for many aspects of [[morphogenesis]], including how and why the cortex gets its folds and how cortical folding abnormalities arise in [[brain disorders]]. \n\n==  Current research ==\nVan Essen is employed at Washington University in St. Louis and manages a lab that examines the structure, function, connectivity, development, and evolution of the [[cerebral cortex]] in both humans and primates. His current research focuses primarily on cortical structure and function in disease models, such as [[autism]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[Williams syndrome|William Syndrome]]. With the use of neuroanatomical data collected through collaboration by Washington University and other private institutions, Van Essen's research has enhanced the development and utilization of different methods used in computerized brain mapping and [[neuroinformatics]] to enhance data findings and analysis.\n\nDavid Van Essen also serves as the Principal Investigator for the [[Human Connectome Project]] (HCP) a 5-year project designed to map the human brain circuitry. This project uses various methods, such as structural and functional imaging methods, to analyze parcellation and connectivity of both human and nonhuman brains. Through the usage of over 1,200 brain models, the project allows researchers to relate their findings to behavioral phenotypes and genetic markers. Most recently, in collaboration with the HCP, the [http://brainvis.wustl.edu/wiki/index.php/Main_Page Van Essen lab] has identified many visual areas in the [[Macaque|macaque monkey]] and has characterized a novel parcellation of the human neocortex. Additionally, with a leading role in the HCP's development, the Van Essen lab is creating a Connectome Workbench for data to be freely available and stored. \n\nVan Essen's laboratory also collaborates with Terrie Inder, Jeff Neil, Jason Hill, and other affiliates to conduct research on human cortical development. Here, the research team studies human cortical development in premature and mature infants to analyze normal cortical maturation and find cortical abnormalities that correspond to childhood developmental abnormalities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://neurosci.wustl.edu/People/Faculty/david-van-essen|title=Dr. David Van Essen|website=neurosci.wustl.edu|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dbbs.wustl.edu/faculty/Pages/faculty_bio.aspx?SID=1569|title=The Division of Biology & Biomedical Sciences|website=dbbs.wustl.edu|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n[[File:Basal ganglia circuits.svg|thumb|Brain Circuits]]\n\n==  Contributions ==\nDavid Van Essen's contributions towards the neurobiology field focus on the central nervous system as well as data sharing.
