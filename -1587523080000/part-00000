British [[reprisal]]s after the murder of a British officer in [[Najaf]] failed to restore order. The most striking problem facing the British was the growing anger of the nationalists, who continued to fight against the imposition of British authority. British administration had yet to be established in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early unrest===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nThree important anticolonial secret societies had been formed in Iraq during 1918 and 1919. The League of the Islamic Awakening (''Jam'iyya an-na\u1e25da al-isl\u0101miyya'') was organized at [[Najaf]]. The Muslim National League (''al-Jam'iyya al-wa\u1e6daniyya al-isl\u0101miyya'') was formed with the object of organizing and mobilizing the population for major resistance. In February 1919, in [[Baghdad]], a coalition of [[Shi'a Islam|Shia]] merchants, [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] teachers, and civil servants, Sunni and Shia [[ulama]], and Iraqi officers formed the [[Guardians of Independence]] (''Har\u0101s al-istiql\u0101l''). The Istiqlal had member groups in [[Karbala]], Najaf, [[Kut]], and [[Hillah]].\n\nThe Grand [[Glossary of Islamic terms in Arabic|Mujtahid]] of Karbala, [[Imam Shirazi]], and his son, [[Mirza Muhammad Riza]], began to organize the insurgent effort.  Shirazi then issued a [[fatwa]] (religious ruling), pointing out that it was against Islamic law for Muslims to countenance being ruled by non-Muslims, and he called for a [[jihad]] against the British. By July 1920, [[Mosul]] was in rebellion against British rule, and the insurrection moved south down the [[Euphrates]] River valley. The southern tribes, who cherished their long-held political autonomy, needed little inducement to join in the fray. They did not cooperate in an organized effort against the British, however, which limited the effect of the revolt. The country was in a state of anarchy for three months; the British restored order only with reinforcements from India.\n\nThe [[Iraqi revolt against the British]] of 1920 was a watershed event in contemporary Iraqi history. For the first time, Sunnis and Shias, tribes and cities, were brought together in a common effort. In the opinion of [[Hanna Batatu]], author of a seminal work on Iraq, the building of a nation-state in Iraq depended upon two major factors: the integration of Shias and Sunnis into the new body politic and the successful resolution of the age-old conflicts between the tribes and the riverine cities and among the tribes themselves over the food-producing flatlands of the [[Tigris]] and the [[Euphrates]]. The 1920 rebellion brought these groups together, if only briefly; this constituted an important first step in the long and arduous process of forging a [[nation-state]] out of Iraq's conflict-ridden social structure.\n\nOn 1 October 1922, the [[Royal Air Force]] in Iraq was reorganized as [[RAF Iraq Command]], and given control of all British forces in the kingdom.<ref>''Overseas commands: Iraq, India and the Far East'', section \"RAF Iraq.\" In: ''[http://www.rafweb.org/Menu.htm Air of authority: A history of RAF organization]''. Retrieved 2015-06-20.</ref> In order to impose the [[Hashemite monarchy]] on the people of Mesopotamia the British used violence, causing 98,000 casualties, gassing and bombing the local resistance into submission. During the  1920s and 1930s, the monarchy was engaged with the British in fighting one revolt after another.<ref>Hazelton, Fran 1989. \"Iraq to 1963\" in CARDRI, \"Saddam\u2019s Iraq: Revolution or Reaction?\" London 1989. p3</ref> The conservative and anti-nationalist British historian [[Elie Kedourie]] records that \"the North as a whole had to be coerced by the Royal Air Force.\"<ref>Kedourie, Elie 1970. \"The Chatham House Version and Other Middle-Eastern Studies\" London. p256</ref> When the Kurdish leader Sheikh Mahmud led another rebellion, the British used the newly established Iraqi army to quel the revolt, but that was ineffective. The British then resorted to the RAF.{{sfn|Kedourie|1970|p=438}} In the same period, rebellions by the Shia in the South had to be suppressed.{{sfn|Kedourie|1970|p=250}}\n\n===Coronation of Faisal===\nAt the [[Cairo Conference (1921)|Cairo Conference]] of March 1921, the British set the parameters for Iraqi political life that were to continue until the [[14 July Revolution|1958 revolution]]; they chose a [[Hashemite]], [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal ibn Husayn]], son of [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] former [[Sharif of Mecca]] as Iraq's first King; they established an Iraqi army (but kept [[Assyrian Levies]] under direct British command); and they proposed a new treaty. To confirm Faisal as Iraq's first monarch, a one-question [[plebiscite]] was carefully arranged that had a return of 96 percent in his favor. The British saw in Faisal a leader who possessed sufficient nationalist and Islamic credentials to have broad appeal, but who also was vulnerable enough to remain dependent on their support. Faisal traced his [[Banu Hashim|descent]] from the family of the Prophet [[Muhammad]].  His ancestors held political authority in the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] since the 10th century. The British believed these credentials would satisfy traditional Arab standards of political legitimacy; moreover, the British thought Faisal would be accepted by the growing Iraqi nationalist movement because of his role in the 1916 [[Arab Revolt]] against the Turks, his achievements as a leader of the Iraq emancipation movement, and his general leadership qualities. Faisal was instated as the Monarch of Iraq after the Naquib of Baghdad was disqualified as being too old (80 yrs) and Sayid Talib (a prominent Iraqi from the province of Basra) was deported on trumped up charges by the British. The voting was far from a reflection of the true feelings of the Iraqi people. Nevertheless, Faisal was considered the most effective choice for the throne by the British government.\n\nThe final major decision taken at the Cairo Conference related to the new [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty]] of 1922. Faisal was under pressure from the nationalists and the anti-British [[mujtahid]]s of Najaf and Karbala to limit both British influence in Iraq and the duration of the treaty. Recognizing that the monarchy depended on British support\u2014 and wishing to avoid a repetition of his experience in Syria \u2014 Faisal maintained a moderate approach in dealing with the UK. The treaty, which had been originally set as a 20-year engagement but later reduced to four years, was ratified in June 1924; it stated that the king would heed British advice on all matters affecting British interests and on fiscal policy as long as Iraq had a [[balance of payments]] deficit with the UK, and that British officials would be appointed to specified posts in 18 departments to act as advisers and inspectors. A subsequent financial agreement, which significantly increased the financial burden on Iraq, required Iraq to pay half the cost of supporting British resident officials, among other expenses. British obligations under the new treaty included providing various kinds of aid, notably military assistance, and proposing Iraq for membership in the League of Nations at the earliest moment. In effect, the treaty ensured that Iraq would remain politically and economically dependent on the UK. While unable to prevent the treaty, Faisal clearly felt that the British had gone back on their promises to him.\n\nThe British decision at the Cairo Conference to establish an indigenous Iraqi army was significant. In Iraq, as in most of the developing world, the military establishment has been the best organized institution in an otherwise weak political system.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Thus, while Iraq's body politic crumbled under immense political and economic pressure throughout the monarchic period, the military gained increasing power and influence; moreover, because the officers in the new army were by necessity Sunnis who had served under the Ottomans, while the lower ranks were predominantly filled by Shia tribal elements, Sunni dominance in the military was preserved.\n\n===Later years===\nThe [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (1930)|new Anglo-Iraqi Treaty]] was signed in June 1930. It provided for a \"close alliance,\" for \"full and frank consultations between the two countries in all matters of [[foreign policy]],\" and for mutual assistance in case of war. Iraq granted the British the use of air bases near [[Basra]] and at [[Al Habbaniyah]] and the right to move troops across the country. The treaty, of twenty-five years' duration, was to come into force upon Iraq's admission to the League of Nations.\n\nWith the signing of the 1930 Treaty and the settling of the [[Mosul Question]], Iraqi politics took on a new dynamic. The emerging class of Sunni and Shia landowning tribal sheikhs vied for positions of power with wealthy and prestigious urban-based Sunni families and with Ottoman-trained army officers and bureaucrats. Because Iraq's newly established political institutions were the creation of a foreign power, and because the concept of democratic government had no precedent in Iraqi history, the politicians in Baghdad lacked legitimacy and never developed deeply rooted constituencies. Thus, despite a constitution and an elected assembly, Iraqi politics was more a shifting alliance of important personalities and cliques than a [[democracy]] in the Western sense. The absence of broadly based political institutions inhibited the early nationalist movement's ability to make deep inroads into Iraq's diverse social structure.\n\nThe Mandatory administration continued to operate until 1932.<ref>Ongsotto et.al.

The main issues centered around agrarian issues and military conscription. Kedourie states that the British crushed protests against military conscription with the use of machine-gunning and bombing from the air. The \"killing, it seems, was indiscriminate, and old men, women and children were the victims.\" When in 1937 a revolt against agrarian and conscription issues broke out, it was also \u2018put down with the help of indiscriminate aerial bombing\u2019.{{sfn|Kedourie|1970|p=237-238}} and Shia religious leaders were expelled because they were Persians.{{sfn|Kedourie|1970|p=250}} Kedourie  describes the monarchy as despotic, with a record \"full of bloodshed, treason and rapine\" and \"however pitiful its end we may know that it was implicit in its beginning.\"{{sfn|Kedourie|1970|p=239}}\n\nIn his assessment of the British mandate and the Iraqi monarchy, author [[Kanan Makiya]] considers the British mandate and its institutions as 'agents of modernisation' more than colonisers:\n{{quote|The British mandate and the institutions it gave rise to in Iraq, were the agents of a modernisation that did not arise gradually or indigenously as the outcome of a population\u2019s own resourcefulness and engagement with the world. The British in Iraq were modernisers more than colonisers, despite acting out of self-interest.<ref>Samir al-Khalil, ''Republic of Fear'' London 1989 p. 174</ref>}}\n\nKedourie's judgement, however, is different:\n{{quote|When we consider the long experience of Britain in the government of Eastern countries, and set beside it the miserable polity which she bestowed on the populations of Mesopotamia, we are seized with rue- ful wonder. It is as though India and Egypt had never existed, as though Lord Cornwallis, Munro and Metcalf, John and Henry Lawrence, Milner and Cromer had attempted in vain to bring order, justice and security to the East, as though Burke and Macaulay, Bentham and James Mill had never addressed their intelligence to the problems and prospects of  oriental government. We  can never cease to marvel how, in the end, all this was discarded...[in] Mesopotamia.<ref>Ellie Kedourie, 2004, ''The Chatham House Version and Other Middle Eastern Studies'' https://archive.org/details/KedourieElieTheChathamHouseVersionAndOtherMiddleEasternStudies p.262</ref>}}\n\nIf Makiya is referring to economic development in his account of the British modernising legacy in Iraq, an authoritative study demonstrates that Iraq's productivity in agriculture, the most important sector at the time, in fact declined from 275&nbsp;kg per acre in 1920 to an average of 238&nbsp;kg per acre between 1953 and 1958.<ref>M.S.

The Iraqi Kingdom under the Hashemites lasted until 1958.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n===Oil concession===\nBefore the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the British-controlled [[Iraq Petroleum Company|Turkish Petroleum Company]] (TPC) had held concessionary rights to the Mosul ''[[wilaya]]'' (province). Under the 1916 [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] \u2014 an agreement in 1916 between Britain and France that delineated future control of the Middle East \u2014 the area would have fallen under French influence. In 1919, however, the French relinquished their claims to Mosul under the terms of the [[Long-Berenger Agreement]]. The 1919 agreement granted the French a 25 percent share in the TPC as compensation.\n\nBeginning in 1923, British and Iraqi negotiators held acrimonious discussions over the new oil concession. The major obstacle was Iraq's insistence on a 20 percent equity participation in the company; this figure had been included in the original TPC concession to the Turks and had been agreed upon at Sanremo for the Iraqis. In the end, despite strong nationalist sentiments against the concession agreement, the Iraqi negotiators acquiesced to it. The League of Nations was soon to vote on the disposition of Mosul, and the Iraqis feared that, without British support, Iraq would lose the area to Turkey. In March 1925, an agreement was concluded that contained none of the Iraqi demands. The TPC, now renamed the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), was granted a full and complete concession for a period of seventy-five years.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MDKDZHGbnOYC&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146&dq=The+major+obstacle+was+Iraq%27s+insistence+on+a+20+percent+equity+participation+in+the+company;+this+figure+had+been+included+in+the+original+TPC+concession+to+the+Turks+and+had+been+agreed+upon+at+Sanremo+for+the+Iraqis&source=bl&ots=nTGD8ugnm8&sig=wCkw0b0v0p-nq3D8nm6OOm-FgaI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZ6u_hzNrSAhXB7yYKHYj8AfYQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=The%20major%20obstacle%20was%20Iraq's%20insistence%20on%20a%2020%20percent%20equity%20participation%20in%20the%20company%3B%20this%20figure%20had%20been%20included%20in%20the%20original%20TPC%20concession%20to%20the%20Turks%20and%20had%20been%20agreed%20upon%20at%20Sanremo%20for%20the%20Iraqis&f=false Iraq: A Country Study], Helen Chapin Metz, in ''Iraq: Issues, Historical Background, Bibliography'', ed.

British [[reprisal]]s after the murder of a British officer in [[Najaf]] failed to restore order. The most striking problem facing the British was the growing anger of the nationalists, who continued to fight against the imposition of British authority. British administration had yet to be established in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Early unrest===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}\nThree important anticolonial secret societies had been formed in Iraq during 1918 and 1919. The League of the Islamic Awakening (''Jam'iyya an-na\u1e25da al-isl\u0101miyya'') was organized at [[Najaf]]. The Muslim National League (''al-Jam'iyya al-wa\u1e6daniyya al-isl\u0101miyya'') was formed with the object of organizing and mobilizing the population for major resistance. In February 1919, in [[Baghdad]], a coalition of [[Shi'a Islam|Shia]] merchants, [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] teachers, and civil servants, Sunni and Shia [[ulama]], and Iraqi officers formed the [[Guardians of Independence]] (''Har\u0101s al-istiql\u0101l''). The Istiqlal had member groups in [[Karbala]], Najaf, [[Kut]], and [[Hillah]].\n\nThe Grand [[Glossary of Islamic terms in Arabic|Mujtahid]] of Karbala, [[Imam Shirazi]], and his son, [[Mirza Muhammad Riza]], began to organize the insurgent effort.  Shirazi then issued a [[fatwa]] (religious ruling), pointing out that it was against Islamic law for Muslims to countenance being ruled by non-Muslims, and he called for a [[jihad]] against the British. By July 1920, [[Mosul]] was in rebellion against British rule, and the insurrection moved south down the [[Euphrates]] River valley. The southern tribes, who cherished their long-held political autonomy, needed little inducement to join in the fray. They did not cooperate in an organized effort against the British, however, which limited the effect of the revolt. The country was in a state of anarchy for three months; the British restored order only with reinforcements from India.\n\nThe [[Iraqi revolt against the British]] of 1920 was a watershed event in contemporary Iraqi history. For the first time, Sunnis and Shias, tribes and cities, were brought together in a common effort. In the opinion of [[Hanna Batatu]], author of a seminal work on Iraq, the building of a nation-state in Iraq depended upon two major factors: the integration of Shias and Sunnis into the new body politic and the successful resolution of the age-old conflicts between the tribes and the riverine cities and among the tribes themselves over the food-producing flatlands of the [[Tigris]] and the [[Euphrates]]. The 1920 rebellion brought these groups together, if only briefly; this constituted an important first step in the long and arduous process of forging a [[nation-state]] out of Iraq's conflict-ridden social structure.\n\nOn 1 October 1922, the [[Royal Air Force]] in Iraq was reorganized as [[RAF Iraq Command]], and given control of all British forces in the kingdom.<ref>''Overseas commands: Iraq, India and the Far East'', section \"RAF Iraq.\" In: ''[http://www.rafweb.org/Menu.htm Air of authority: A history of RAF organization]''. Retrieved 2015-06-20.</ref> In order to impose the [[Hashemite monarchy]] on the people of Mesopotamia the British used violence, causing 98,000 casualties, gassing and bombing the local resistance into submission. During the  1920s and 1930s, the monarchy was engaged with the British in fighting one revolt after another.<ref>Hazelton, Fran 1989. \"Iraq to 1963\" in CARDRI, \"Saddam\u2019s Iraq: Revolution or Reaction?\" London 1989. p3</ref> The conservative and anti-nationalist British historian [[Elie Kedourie]] records that \"the North as a whole had to be coerced by the Royal Air Force.\"<ref>Kedourie, Elie 1970. \"The Chatham House Version and Other Middle-Eastern Studies\" London. p256</ref> When the Kurdish leader Sheikh Mahmud led another rebellion, the British used the newly established Iraqi army to quel the revolt, but that was ineffective. The British then resorted to the RAF.{{sfn|Kedourie|1970|p=438}} In the same period, rebellions by the Shia in the South had to be suppressed.{{sfn|Kedourie|1970|p=250}}\n\n===Coronation of Faisal===\nAt the [[Cairo Conference (1921)|Cairo Conference]] of March 1921, the British set the parameters for Iraqi political life that were to continue until the [[14 July Revolution|1958 revolution]]; they chose a [[Hashemite]], [[Faisal I of Iraq|Faisal ibn Husayn]], son of [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] former [[Sharif of Mecca]] as Iraq's first King; they established an Iraqi army (but kept [[Assyrian Levies]] under direct British command); and they proposed a new treaty. To confirm Faisal as Iraq's first monarch, a one-question [[plebiscite]] was carefully arranged that had a return of 96 percent in his favor. The British saw in Faisal a leader who possessed sufficient nationalist and Islamic credentials to have broad appeal, but who also was vulnerable enough to remain dependent on their support. Faisal traced his [[Banu Hashim|descent]] from the family of the Prophet [[Muhammad]].  His ancestors held political authority in the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] since the 10th century. The British believed these credentials would satisfy traditional Arab standards of political legitimacy; moreover, the British thought Faisal would be accepted by the growing Iraqi nationalist movement because of his role in the 1916 [[Arab Revolt]] against the Turks, his achievements as a leader of the Iraq emancipation movement, and his general leadership qualities. Faisal was instated as the Monarch of Iraq after the Naquib of Baghdad was disqualified as being too old (80 yrs) and Sayid Talib (a prominent Iraqi from the province of Basra) was deported on trumped up charges by the British. The voting was far from a reflection of the true feelings of the Iraqi people. Nevertheless, Faisal was considered the most effective choice for the throne by the British government.\n\nThe final major decision taken at the Cairo Conference related to the new [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty]] of 1922. Faisal was under pressure from the nationalists and the anti-British [[mujtahid]]s of Najaf and Karbala to limit both British influence in Iraq and the duration of the treaty. Recognizing that the monarchy depended on British support\u2014 and wishing to avoid a repetition of his experience in Syria \u2014 Faisal maintained a moderate approach in dealing with the UK. The treaty, which had been originally set as a 20-year engagement but later reduced to four years, was ratified in June 1924; it stated that the king would heed British advice on all matters affecting British interests and on fiscal policy as long as Iraq had a [[balance of payments]] deficit with the UK, and that British officials would be appointed to specified posts in 18 departments to act as advisers and inspectors. A subsequent financial agreement, which significantly increased the financial burden on Iraq, required Iraq to pay half the cost of supporting British resident officials, among other expenses. British obligations under the new treaty included providing various kinds of aid, notably military assistance, and proposing Iraq for membership in the League of Nations at the earliest moment. In effect, the treaty ensured that Iraq would remain politically and economically dependent on the UK. While unable to prevent the treaty, Faisal clearly felt that the British had gone back on their promises to him.\n\nThe British decision at the Cairo Conference to establish an indigenous Iraqi army was significant. In Iraq, as in most of the developing world, the military establishment has been the best organized institution in an otherwise weak political system.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Thus, while Iraq's body politic crumbled under immense political and economic pressure throughout the monarchic period, the military gained increasing power and influence; moreover, because the officers in the new army were by necessity Sunnis who had served under the Ottomans, while the lower ranks were predominantly filled by Shia tribal elements, Sunni dominance in the military was preserved.\n\n===Later years===\nThe [[Anglo-Iraqi Treaty (1930)|new Anglo-Iraqi Treaty]] was signed in June 1930. It provided for a \"close alliance,\" for \"full and frank consultations between the two countries in all matters of [[foreign policy]],\" and for mutual assistance in case of war. Iraq granted the British the use of air bases near [[Basra]] and at [[Al Habbaniyah]] and the right to move troops across the country. The treaty, of twenty-five years' duration, was to come into force upon Iraq's admission to the League of Nations.\n\nWith the signing of the 1930 Treaty and the settling of the [[Mosul Question]], Iraqi politics took on a new dynamic. The emerging class of Sunni and Shia landowning tribal sheikhs vied for positions of power with wealthy and prestigious urban-based Sunni families and with Ottoman-trained army officers and bureaucrats. Because Iraq's newly established political institutions were the creation of a foreign power, and because the concept of democratic government had no precedent in Iraqi history, the politicians in Baghdad lacked legitimacy and never developed deeply rooted constituencies. Thus, despite a constitution and an elected assembly, Iraqi politics was more a shifting alliance of important personalities and cliques than a [[democracy]] in the Western sense. The absence of broadly based political institutions inhibited the early nationalist movement's ability to make deep inroads into Iraq's diverse social structure.\n\nThe Mandatory administration continued to operate until 1932.<ref>Ongsotto et.al.

The main issues centered around agarian issues and military conscription. Kedourie states that the British crushed protests against military conscription with the use of machine-gunning and bombing from the air. The \"killing, it seems, was indiscriminate, and old men, women and children were the victims.\" When in 1937 a revolt against agrarian and conscription issues broke out, it was also \u2018put down with the help of indiscriminate aerial bombing\u2019.{{sfn|Kedourie|1970|p=237-238}} and Shia religious leaders were expelled because they were Persians.{{sfn|Kedourie|1970|p=250}} Kedourie  describes the monarchy as despotic, with a record \"full of bloodshed, treason and rapine\" and \"however pitiful its end we may know that it was implicit in its beginning.\"{{sfn|Kedourie|1970|p=239}}\n\nIn his assessment of the British mandate and the Iraqi monarchy, author [[Kanan Makiya]] considers the British mandate and its institutions as 'agents of modernisation' more than colonisers:\n{{quote|The British mandate and the institutions it gave rise to in Iraq, were the agents of a modernisation that did not arise gradually or indigenously as the outcome of a population\u2019s own resourcefulness and engagement with the world. The British in Iraq were modernisers more than colonisers, despite acting out of self-interest.<ref>Samir al-Khalil, ''Republic of Fear'' London 1989 p. 174</ref>}}\n\nKedourie's judgement, however, is different:\n{{quote|When we consider the long experience of Britain in the government of Eastern countries, and set beside it the miserable polity which she bestowed on the populations of Mesopotamia, we are seized with rue- ful wonder. It is as though India and Egypt had never existed, as though Lord Cornwallis, Munro and Metcalf, John and Henry Lawrence, Milner and Cromer had attempted in vain to bring order, justice and security to the East, as though Burke and Macaulay, Bentham and James Mill had never addressed their intelligence to the problems and prospects of  oriental government. We  can never cease to marvel how, in the end, all this was discarded...[in] Mesopotamia.<ref>Ellie Kedourie, 2004, ''The Chatham House Version and Other Middle Eastern Studies'' https://archive.org/details/KedourieElieTheChathamHouseVersionAndOtherMiddleEasternStudies p.262</ref>}}\n\nIf Makiya is referring to economic development in his account of the British modernising legacy in Iraq, an authoritative study demonstrates that Iraq's productivity in agriculture, the most important sector at the time, in fact declined from 275&nbsp;kg per acre in 1920 to an average of 238&nbsp;kg per acre between 1953 and 1958.<ref>M.S.

The Iraqi Kingdom under the Hashemites lasted until 1958.\n\n== Economy ==\n\n===Oil concession===\nBefore the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]], the British-controlled [[Iraq Petroleum Company|Turkish Petroleum Company]] (TPC) had held concessionary rights to the Mosul ''[[wilaya]]'' (province). Under the 1916 [[Sykes-Picot Agreement]] \u2014 an agreement in 1916 between Britain and France that delineated future control of the Middle East \u2014 the area would have fallen under French influence. In 1919, however, the French relinquished their claims to Mosul under the terms of the [[Long-Berenger Agreement]]. The 1919 agreement granted the French a 25 percent share in the TPC as compensation.\n\nBeginning in 1923, British and Iraqi negotiators held acrimonious discussions over the new oil concession. The major obstacle was Iraq's insistence on a 20 percent equity participation in the company; this figure had been included in the original TPC concession to the Turks and had been agreed upon at Sanremo for the Iraqis. In the end, despite strong nationalist sentiments against the concession agreement, the Iraqi negotiators acquiesced to it. The League of Nations was soon to vote on the disposition of Mosul, and the Iraqis feared that, without British support, Iraq would lose the area to Turkey. In March 1925, an agreement was concluded that contained none of the Iraqi demands. The TPC, now renamed the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), was granted a full and complete concession for a period of seventy-five years.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MDKDZHGbnOYC&pg=PA146&lpg=PA146&dq=The+major+obstacle+was+Iraq%27s+insistence+on+a+20+percent+equity+participation+in+the+company;+this+figure+had+been+included+in+the+original+TPC+concession+to+the+Turks+and+had+been+agreed+upon+at+Sanremo+for+the+Iraqis&source=bl&ots=nTGD8ugnm8&sig=wCkw0b0v0p-nq3D8nm6OOm-FgaI&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZ6u_hzNrSAhXB7yYKHYj8AfYQ6AEIHDAA#v=onepage&q=The%20major%20obstacle%20was%20Iraq's%20insistence%20on%20a%2020%20percent%20equity%20participation%20in%20the%20company%3B%20this%20figure%20had%20been%20included%20in%20the%20original%20TPC%20concession%20to%20the%20Turks%20and%20had%20been%20agreed%20upon%20at%20Sanremo%20for%20the%20Iraqis&f=false Iraq: A Country Study], Helen Chapin Metz, in ''Iraq: Issues, Historical Background, Bibliography'', ed.

It was released on January 31, 2020, through [[RCA Records|RCA]] and [[Kemosabe Records]]. Announced in late 2019, the album saw the singer once again taking over the role of sole [[executive producer]], following ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017). She collaborated with various songwriters and record producers to achieve her desired sonority, combining elements of her career beginnings and ''Rainbow''. Musically, the record is primarily a [[Pop music|pop]], [[Country music|country]] and [[classic rock]] production, although it encompasses a variety of genres, including [[dance-pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]].\n\n''High Road'' was met with polarized reviews from music critics. The singer's reapproach of her partying personality was targeted by both positive and negative evaluations. The album debuted at number seven on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, making it Kesha's fourth top-ten album in the country. It was supported by four singles: \"[[Raising Hell (Kesha song)|Raising Hell]]\" featuring [[Big Freedia]], \"[[My Own Dance]]\", \"[[Resentment (Kesha song)|Resentment]]\", and \"[[Tonight (Kesha song)|Tonight]]\". Kesha will embark on the [[High Road Tour]] to promote the album.\n\n== Background and release ==\nAfter the release of [[Rainbow (Kesha album)|''Rainbow'']], her third studio album, Kesha issued a new single titled \"[[Rich, White, Straight Men]]\" in June 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Murphy |first1=Sarah |title=Kesha Calls Out \"Rich, White, Straight, Men\" on New Song |url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/kesha_calls_out_rich_white_straight_men_on_new_song |website=[[Exclaim!]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |language=en-ca |date=June 4, 2019}}</ref> It was initially uploaded onto her [[YouTube]] account on June 2 without prior announcement and was made available in [[online music store]]s and [[Streaming media|streaming]] platforms six days later.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pykeren |first1=Sam Van |title=Kesha gets her old weird sparkle back with her new single \"Rich, White, Straight, Men\" |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2019/06/keshas-gets-her-old-weird-sparkle-back-with-her-new-single-rich-white-straight-men/ |website=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |date=June 7, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rich, White, Straight Men - Single by Kesha |url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/rich-white-straight-men-single/1467282032 |website=[[Apple Music]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rich, White, Straight Men / Kesha |url=https://listen.tidal.com/album/110743402 |website=[[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020}}</ref> In September 2019, [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] published a cover story about the singer, in which she announced that her fourth studio album was in development and would be released in following December.<ref name=\"Billboard1\">{{cite web |last1=Havens |first1=Lindsey |title=Kesha Is Ready to 'Inspire Joy' -- And Write Huge Pop Songs Again |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/8530914/kesha-billboard-cover-story-interview-2019 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |date=September 26, 2019}}</ref> Whilst discussing the lyrics of the album, Kesha commented that it would emphasize \"the happiness that I began my career with\", although \"more earned and healthier than ever\".<ref name=\"Billboard1\" /> Musically, it would define a \"full return to Kesha's [[Pop music|pop]] roots, after leaning into a more [[Country music|country]]-[[Soul music|soul]] sound\" in ''Rainbow''.<ref name=\"Fader1\">{{cite web |last1=Maicki |first1=Salvatore |title=Kesha\u2019s new album is dropping in December |url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/26/kesha-new-album-december-2019 |website=[[The Fader]] |accessdate=March 31, 2020 |language=en |date=September 26, 2019}}</ref> Kesha worked with some previous partners, such as [[Wrabel]], [[Nate Ruess]], and her mother [[Pebe Sebert]], as well as new collaborators, including [[Justin Tranter]], [[Tayla Parx]], and [[Dan Reynolds (singer)|Dan Reynolds]] of [[Imagine Dragons]].<ref name=\"Fader1\"/>\n\nThe record's release date was postponed to January 10 and later to January 31, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Heller |first1=Corinne |title=Kesha Refuses to Wallow in ''Tragedy'' Amid Dr. Luke Legal Battle |url=https://www.eonline.com/news/1095414/why-kesha-refuses-to-wallow-in-tragedy-amid-dr-luke-legal-battle |website=[[E!

It was released on January 31, 2020, through [[RCA Records|RCA]] and [[Kemosabe Records]]. Announced in late 2019, the album saw the singer once again taking over the role of sole [[executive producer]], following ''[[Rainbow (Kesha album)|Rainbow]]'' (2017). She collaborated with various songwriters and record producers to achieve her desired sonority, combining elements of her career beginnings and ''Rainbow''. Musically, the record is primarily a [[Pop music|pop]], [[Country music|country]] and [[classic rock]] production, although it encompasses a variety of genres, including [[dance-pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[Gospel music|gospel]].\n\n''High Road'' was met with polarized reviews from music critics. The singer's reapproach of her partying personality was targeted by both positive and negative evaluations.

The union of the personas approached by Kesha throughout her career, which occurs musically and lyrically on the album, received polarizing responses, with some critics praising the artist's uniqueness, while others pointed out a false personality construction. At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album has an average score of 73 based on 19 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> Aggregator [[AnyDecentMusic?]]  gave it 7 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus.<ref name=\"AnyDecentMusic\" />\n\nAdam White of ''[[The Independent]]'' praised the singer's maturity and confidence.<ref name=\"IndependentReview\"/> ''[[The A.V.

Normally, ''DUX4'' is expressed during embryogenesis and throughout life in the testes, but otherwise is repressed. Two genetic elements are required for ''DUX4'' to be derepressed to the point of causing muscle damage. First, there must be a mutation that relieves epigenetic repression of ''DUX4'' by causing hypomethylation of the surrounding region, allowing transcription of ''DUX4'' into messenger RNA (mRNA). Several mutations cause hypomethylation, upon which FSHD is subclassified into FSHD type 1 (FSHD1) and FSHD type 2 (FSHD2).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe second genetic element needed is an allele downstream to ''DUX4'' that allows stability to ''DUX4'' mRNA by providing a polyadenylation sequence, which allows ''DUX4'' mRNA to persist long enough to be translated into ''DUX4'' protein, which is what causes muscle damage. The allele that allows stability to ''DUX4'' mRNA is called a 4qA allele, which is a [[haplotype]] polymorphism. The 4qB allele does not have a polyadenylation sequence.\n\n{{anchor|D4Z4}} <!-- Anchor point to allow easy linking to D4Z4 information, since this is not found in any other WP article. -->\n''DUX4'' resides within the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array, a series of tandemly repeated DNA segments in the [[subtelomeric]] region (4q35) of [[Chromosome 4 (human)|chromosome 4]].

''DUX4'' protein is a transcription factor that regulates many other genes. Some of these genes are involved in [[apoptosis]], such as p53, p21, MYC, and \u03b2-catenin. It seems that ''DUX4'' makes muscle cells more prone to apoptosis, although details of the mechanism are still unknown and contested. Other ''DUX4'' regulated genes are involved in oxidative stress, and it seems that ''DUX4'' expression lowers muscle cell tolerance of oxidative stress. Variation in the ability of individual muscles to handle oxidative stress could partially explain the muscle involvement patterns of FSHD. ''DUX4'' downregulates many genes involved in muscle development, including MyoD, myogenin, desmin, and Pax7. ''DUX4'' has shown to reduce muscle cell proliferation, differentiation, and fusion. Estrogen seems to play a role on in modifying ''DUX4'' effects on muscle differentiation, which could explain why females are less affected than males. ''DUX4'' regulates a few genes that are involved in RNA quality control, and ''DUX4'' expression has been shown to cause accumulation of RNA with subsequent apoptosis.<ref name=\"Lim2020PathogenesisReview\">{{cite journal |last1=Lim |first1=KRQ |last2=Nguyen |first2=Q |last3=Yokota |first3=T |title=DUX4 Signalling in the Pathogenesis of Facioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy. |journal=International journal of molecular sciences |date=22 January 2020 |volume=21 |issue=3 |doi=10.3390/ijms21030729 |pmid=31979100|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nThe cellular [[hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] response has been reported in a single study to be the main driver of ''DUX4''-induced muscle cell death.

FSHD-affected cells produce a full length transcript, DUX4-fl, whereas alternative splicing in unaffected individuals results in the production of a shorter, 3'-truncated transcript (DUX4-s). The low overall expression of both transcripts in muscle is attributed to relatively high expression in a small number of nuclei (~ 1 in 1000).

Normally, ''DUX4'' is expressed during embryogenesis and throughout life in the testes, but otherwise is repressed. Two genetic elements are required for ''DUX4'' to be derepressed to the point of causing muscle damage. First, there must be a mutation that relieves epigenetic repression of ''DUX4'' by causing hypomethylation of the surrounding region, allowing transcription of ''DUX4'' into messenger RNA (mRNA). Several mutations cause hypomethylation, upon which FSHD is subclassified into FSHD type 1 (FSHD1) and FSHD type 2 (FSHD2).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nThe second genetic element needed is an allele downstream to ''DUX4'' that allows stability to ''DUX4'' mRNA by providing a polyadenylation sequence, which allows ''DUX4'' mRNA to persist long enough to be translated into ''DUX4'' protein, which is what causes muscle damage. The allele that allows stability to ''DUX4'' mRNA is called a 4qA allele, which is a [[haplotype]] polymorphism. The 4qB allele does not have a polyadenylation sequence.\n\n''DUX4'' resides within the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array, a series of tandemly repeated DNA segments in the [[subtelomeric]] region (4q35) of [[Chromosome 4 (human)|chromosome 4]]. Each D4Z4 repeat is 3.2 [[base pair|kilobase pairs]] (kb) long and is the site of epigenetic regulation, containing both [[heterochromatin]] and [[euchromatin]] structures.<ref name=\"Quest March\u2013April 2007\"/><ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Dixit M, Ansseau E, Tassin A, etal |title=DUX4, a candidate gene of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, encodes a transcriptional activator of PITX1 |journal=Proc.

About 80% of FSHD2 cases are due to deactivating mutations in the ''SMCHD1'' gene on [[chromosome 18]], a gene responsible for DNA methylation. ''SMCHD1'' deactivation results in hypomethylation of the D4Z4 repeat array. Once ''DUX4'' is expressed, the molecular events are indistinguishable from FSHD1. Because ''SMCHD1'' is on a different chromosome than the 4qA allele, the two are inherited independently (they are [[Genetic linkage|unlinked]]), resulting in a digenic inheritance pattern. For example, one parent without FSHD can pass on the ''SMCHD1'' mutation, and the second parent without FSHD can pass on the 4qA allele, bearing a child with FSHD2. The remaining 20% of FSHD2 cases are presumably due to mutations at other unidentified genetic locations.<ref name=\"Lemmers 1370\u20131374\">{{Cite journal|title = Digenic inheritance of an SMCHD1 mutation and an FSHD-permissive D4Z4 allele causes facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2|last = Lemmers|first = RJ|date = Dec 2012|journal = Nature Genetics|doi = 10.1038/ng.2454|last2 = Tawil|first2 = R|volume = 44|pages = 1370\u20131374|last3 = Petek|first3 = LM|issue=12|display-authors=etal|pmid=23143600|pmc=3671095}}</ref><ref name=\"Wagner Review Article 2019\" />\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n[[File:DUX4 Signalling in FSHD.png|thumb|DUX4 signaling in FSHD-affected skeletal muscle.|400px]]\nAs of 2020, there seems to be a consensus that aberrant expression of ''DUX4'' in muscle is the cause of FSHD.<ref name=\"Lim2020PathogenesisReview\" /> ''DUX4'' is expressed in extremely small amounts, detectable in 1 out of every 1000 myoblast cells, which appears to increase after myoblast maturation, in part because the cells fuse as they mature, and a single nucleus expressing ''DUX4'' can provide ''DUX4'' protein to neighboring nuclei.<ref name=\"Bosnakovski2020DUX4FAP\">{{cite journal |last1=Bosnakovski |first1=Darko |last2=Shams |first2=Ahmed S. |last3=Yuan |first3=Ce |last4=da Silva |first4=Meiricris T. |last5=Ener |first5=Elizabeth T. |last6=Baumann |first6=Cory W. |last7=Lindsay |first7=Angus J. |last8=Verma |first8=Mayank |last9=Asakura |first9=Atsushi |last10=Lowe |first10=Dawn A. |last11=Kyba |first11=Michael |title=Transcriptional and cytopathological hallmarks of FSHD in chronic DUX4-expressing mice |journal=Journal of Clinical Investigation |date=6 April 2020 |doi=10.1172/JCI133303}}</ref>\n\nIt remains an area of active research how ''DUX4'' causes muscle damage. ''DUX4'' protein is a transcription factor that regulates many other genes. Some of these genes are involved in [[apoptosis]], such as p53, p21, MYC, and \u03b2-catenin. It seems that ''DUX4'' makes muscle cells more prone to apoptosis, although details of the mechanism are still unknown and contested. Other ''DUX4'' regulated genes are involved in oxidative stress, and it seems that ''DUX4'' expression lowers muscle cell tolerance of oxidative stress. Variation in the ability of individual muscles to handle oxidative stress could partially explain the muscle involvement patterns of FSHD. ''DUX4'' downregulates many genes involved in muscle development, including MyoD, myogenin, desmin, and Pax7. ''DUX4'' has shown to reduce muscle cell proliferation, differentiation, and fusion. Estrogen seems to play a role on in modifying ''DUX4'' effects on muscle differentiation, which could explain why females are less affected than males.

Higher levels of DUX4 expression in human testis (~100 fold higher than skeletal muscle) suggest a developmental role for DUX4 in human development. Higher levels of DUX4-s (vs DUX4-fl) are shown to correlate with a greater degree of DUX-4 H3K9me3-methylation.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy: incomplete suppression of a retrotransposed gene|last = Snider|first = L|date = Oct 2010|journal = PLoS Genetics|doi =10.1371/journal.pgen.1001181 |volume = 6|issue = 10|page = e1001181|last2 = Geng|first2 = LN|last3 = Lemmers|first3 = RJ|display-authors=etal|pmid=21060811|pmc=2965761}}</ref>     \n'''2012    '''\n* Some, but not all, instances of FSHD2 are linked to mutations in the SMCHD1 gene on [[chromosome 18]].
