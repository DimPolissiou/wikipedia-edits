In 1930's he served on carriers [[USS Lexington (CV-2)|Lexington]] and [[USS Saratoga (CV-3)|Saratoga]]. He was promoted to [[Lieutenant Commander]] on 1 July 1941 and became the [[commanding officer]] of [[VF-2|Fighter Squadron 2 (VF-2)]]. During the early stage of [[Pacific War]], his [[executive officer]] was [[Lieutenant (navy)|Lieutenant]] [[James H. Flatley|James Flatley]]. They both participated in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in May 1942, however Flatley was transferred to [[VF-42|Fighter Squadron 42 (VF-42)]] just prior to the battle but managed to get permission to participate in the operation. At the time of the battle, VF-2 was assigned to carrier Lexington.\n\n==Coral Sea==\nOn 7 May, Lieutenant Commander Ramsey led a group of [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]] fighters to escort [[Douglas TBD Devastator]] from [[VT-2]] in the attack that sank light carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sh\u014dh\u014d|''Sh\u014dh\u014d'']]. In response to sinking of ''Sh\u014dh\u014d'', [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) main carrier force launched a night strike on USN carriers composed of 15 [[Nakajima B5N]] and 12 [[Aichi D3A]] bombers. Ramsey led a group of F4F Wildcats to intercept. He set up an ambush in heavy overcast weather, which resulted in numerous losses of IJN aircraft and some of their most experience pilots. He personally destroyed two B5N [[torpedo bombers]].\n\nThe following day, on 8 May, Lieutenant Commander Ramsey was involved in Combat Air Patrol over friendly carriers. His group of F4F Wildcats spotted an approaching formation of D3A [[dive bombers]] at a higher altitude. However, they were unable to climb in time to intercept, due to the poor climb rate of F4F Wildcat and relatively high altitude difference. After the enemy dive bombers made their attack on the USN carriers, he and his wingman spotted [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] at a lower altitude and dived on it. They hit the Zero but he managed to escape into a cloud. Moments later, Ramsey spotted another lone Zero, which he managed to shot down.\n\n==Later career==\nAfter Coral Sea, he returned to the Washington, United States where in April 1943 he was appointed director of the flight test division at the Anacostia Naval Air Station. He later commanded the carrier [[USS Philippine Sea (CV-47)|Philippine Sea]] during the [[Korean War]].

Settled by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]] and [[Anglo-Saxons]], the area remained largely agricultural and mining grew in importance in the medieval era. [[Richard Arkwright]] built his [[cotton mill]]s at the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Quarrying became important as mining declined. Tourism grew after the advent of the railways, visitors attracted by the landscape, [[spa town]]s at [[Buxton]] and [[Matlock Bath]], [[Castleton, Derbyshire|Castleton]]'s show caves, and [[Bakewell]], the national park's only town. \n\nTourism remains important for its towns and villages and their varied attractions, [[country house]]s and heritage sites. Outside the towns, walking on the extensive network of public footpaths, cycle trails, rock climbing and caving are popular pursuits.

It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $103 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings were attributed to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an [[elf]] high-schooler lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco, whom both Ian and Barley dislike.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, legally named The Manticore, also known as \"Corey\". Arguing with Ian over the map, The Manticore realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends The Manticore, who agrees to help her. The Manticore warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]]. \n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixies]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=22 March 2020 |date=21 February 2020}}</ref>, relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements. Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide, blocking their pursuers. Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, surfacing to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian lashes out at Barley for leading them on a wild goose chase and walks away with Wilden. \n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse The Manticore spoke of, which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. The Manticore flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\", while they both improve their relationship with Colt. The Manticore reopens her tavern in its original spirit, drawing in customers with tales of past adventures, and Ian and Barley continue questing.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Ian Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /> a teenaged [[elf]] who is Barley's younger brother and Laurel and Wilden's son.\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Barley Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook>{{cite web |url=https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html |title=Breaking: First Look at Characters Ian and Barley Lightfoot from Pixar's Suburban Fantasy Film, 'Onward' (In Theaters March 6, 2020) |author=Pixar Post |publisher=|access-date=May 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529172427/https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html|archive-date=May 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ian's older brother, and Laurel and Wilden's son who longs for a magical quest.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Laurel Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /><ref name=\"Clips\">{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/ |title=D23: Pixar Brings New Onward Clips |last=White |first=James |date=August 25, 2019 |website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=August 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825105550/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/|archive-date=August 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the widowed mother of Ian and Barley.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as The \"Corey\" Manticore, a [[manticore]] restaurant owner and former adventurer whom Ian and Barley go to for help on their quest.\n* [[Mel Rodriguez]] as Colt Bronco, a [[centaur]] police officer and Laurel's new husband.<ref name=twit3600/>\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Wilden Lightfoot, Ian and Barley's late father and Laurel's late husband.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Specter, a [[cyclops]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|title=Disney-Pixar's \"Onward\" Will Feature the First Openly LGBTQ Character|date=February 22, 2020|via=Inside the Magic|access-date=February 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222040111/https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|archive-date=February 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|title=Pixar's first out gay character to be voiced by Lena Waithe in 'Onward'|last=Frishberg|first=Hannah|date=February 24, 2020|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=February 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225133013/https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Gore, a [[faun]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|title=Behold: Character posters for #PixarOnward, including newly-announced cast @AliWong, @LenaWaithe, and @_MelRodriguez_.\u2728 Check back tomorrow to see the brand-new trailer for the film|via=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217032256/https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|archive-date=December 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Dewdrop, a [[pixie]] and the leader of the Pixie Dusters [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]].\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Grecklin, a [[gremlin]] pawn shop owner.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Gaxton, an elf and college friend of Wilden.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* George Psarras as Avel, an elf police officer.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Fenwick, a cyclops construction worker.<ref name=\"WholeCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|title=Stars attended the world premiere of Disney Pixar's \"Onward\" at the El Capitan Theatre on Feb. 18, 2020 in Hollywood, Calif.|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221191311/https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|archive-date=February 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production ==\n===Development===\nIn July 2017, Pixar announced a \"suburban fantasy world\" film at the [[D23 Expo]], with Scanlon directing and Rae producing.<ref name=\"Synopsis\"/> The film was inspired by the death of Scanlon's father, when he and his brother were younger, and their relationship.

Ian and the goat girl come across a booth hosted by three evil mermaids. The mermaids sing their mesmerizing song to lure the two into staying in one of three houses put for rent. Ian tries to silence them with the staff but the spell is too weak. When Ian and the goat girl are finally in a trance, the mermaids place them in one of the houses. The house they are in starts to sink into the ground. \n\nThe goat girl was omitted because the filmmakers want the film to focus on the relationship between Ian and Barley.

Official trailers were released in October and December 2019.\n\n== Lawsuit ==\nIn January 2020, San Francisco tattoo artist Sweet Cecily Daniher filed a copyright lawsuit against Disney, Pixar, and ''Onward'' producer Kori Rae. In September 2018, Pixar rented Daniher's \"Vanicorn\", a van decorated with a unicorn-themed mural, for use in a one-day festival. She learned about the production of ''Onward'' in May 2019 and, after seeing images of the van used by Ian and Barley Lightfoot in the film, came to believe that Pixar had copied the design of the Vanicorn in violation of her rental agreement with the company, as well as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]], and the California Artists Protection Act. She sought in her suit to prohibit distribution of the film and any infringing advertisements or merchandise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|title=Artist Sues Disney, Pixar Over Unicorn-Adorned Van in 'Onward'|last=Cullins|first=Ashley|date=January 28, 2020|website=The Hollywood Reporter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129154442/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|archive-date=January 29, 2020|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Onward'' grossed $61.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $41.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $103.2 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> It was speculated the gross for the film was significantly [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|affected by the coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |title=Cinema audiences drop dramatically as coronavirus restrictions bite |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317010316/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |archive-date=March 17, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |title=Box Office: 'Onward' Leads as Coronavirus Stunts North American Sales |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314224942/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |archive-date=March 14, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |title=Bloodshot and Onward suffer during worst US box office weekend in 22 years |date=March 16, 2020 |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324144029/https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |archive-date=March 24, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside ''[[The Way Back (2020 film)|The Way Back]]'' and the wide expansion of ''[[Emma (2020 film)|Emma]]'', and was projected to gross $45\u201350 million from 4,200 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |title=Disney-Pixar's 'Onward' Eyes $100M Global Start, Even With Coronavirus Concerns |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |first2=Nancy |last2=Tartaglione |date=March 3, 2020 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304013005/https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |archive-date=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The film held early advance screenings on February 29, and made $650,000 from 470 theaters.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/#449321631858 |title= Weekend Box Office: 'Onward' Sells Out, 'My Hero Academia' Surprises And 'Wendy' Flops |author= Scott Mendleson |date= March 1, 2020 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |website= [[Forbes]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303203235/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/#449321631858 |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> It then made $12.1 million on its first day, including $2 million from Thursday night previews.

It received generally positive reviews from critics and has grossed $103 million worldwide. The film's financial shortcomings were attributed to the [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], which resulted in theaters around the globe being closed. Like several other films released in March, it was made available digitally two weeks after its theatrical release.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a world inhabited by [[Legendary creature|mythical creatures]], magic was once commonplace, though difficult to master. After technological advances over the years, magic became obsolete and was largely discarded.\n\nIn a time equivalent to the modern day, Ian Lightfoot, an [[elf]] high-schooler lacking self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a history and [[role-playing game]] fanatic, live in the city of New Mushroomton. Their father Wilden died shortly before Ian was born, and their mother Laurel has a new boyfriend, [[centaur]] police officer Colt Bronco, whom both Ian and Barley dislike.\n\nOn Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden: a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a \"visitation spell\" that can resurrect their father for a single day. Ian accidentally succeeds in casting the spell, but only the lower half of Wilden's body is reformed before the gem disintegrates. The brothers embark on a quest to acquire another gem and complete the spell, taking Barley's beloved [[van]] \"Guinevere\". Finding the boys gone, Laurel leaves to find them.\n\nIan and Barley visit the [[Manticore]]\u2019s Tavern, named for a monster possessing a map to the gem. The tavern has become a [[family restaurant]] managed by the Manticore, legally named The Manticore, also known as \"Corey\". Arguing with Ian over the map, The Manticore realizes how boring her life has become and drives the customers away in a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The brothers' only clue to the gem is a children's menu suggesting \"Raven's Point\", a nearby mountain. Laurel later arrives at the scene and befriends The Manticore, who agrees to help her. The Manticore warns that the brothers' journey may awaken a curse that can only be defeated by her special sword, which she and Laurel steal from a [[Pawnbroker|pawn shop]]. \n\nTraveling to the mountains, Ian and Barley narrowly escape the police and a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] of [[pixies]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sims |first1=David |title=Pixar Needs to Make More Movies Like 'Onward' |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/02/onward-movie-review-dan-scanlon-chris-pratt/606736/ |website=The Atlantic |accessdate=22 March 2020 |date=21 February 2020}}</ref>, relying on Ian's newly awakened spell-casting abilities and Barley's role-playing game instincts. \"Raven's Point\" leads them on a trail indicated by a series of [[raven]] statues, but Colt follows them, calling in reinforcements. Barley sacrifices Guinevere to cause a landslide, blocking their pursuers. Following the statues, the brothers descend through a cave and avoid a series of traps and deadly creatures, surfacing to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian lashes out at Barley for leading them on a wild goose chase and walks away with Wilden. \n\nRereading his list of things he always wished to do with his father, Ian realizes that Barley has been a father figure throughout his entire life, and returns to make amends. Barley discovers the gem inside a historic fountain and retrieves it, unwittingly triggering the curse The Manticore spoke of, which turns the high school into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian faces the artificial dragon, but his staff is knocked into the ocean; he reforms it from a splinter and continues the fight. The Manticore flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the artificial dragon's heart, buying Ian time to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden, and holds off the artificial dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden dissipates, Barley tells Ian that their father is proud of him, and the brothers share a hug.\n\nIan's confidence and spell-casting improve and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the \"Guinevere 2\", while they both improve their relationship with Colt. The Manticore reopens her tavern in its original spirit, drawing in customers with tales of past adventures, and Ian and Barley continue questing.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] as Ian Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /> a teenaged [[elf]] who is Barley's younger brother and Laurel and Wilden's son.\n* [[Chris Pratt]] as Barley Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook>{{cite web |url=https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html |title=Breaking: First Look at Characters Ian and Barley Lightfoot from Pixar's Suburban Fantasy Film, 'Onward' (In Theaters March 6, 2020) |author=Pixar Post |publisher=|access-date=May 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529172427/https://www.pixarpost.com/2019/05/pixar-onward-first-look.html|archive-date=May 29, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Ian's older brother, and Laurel and Wilden's son who longs for a magical quest.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Laurel Lightfoot,<ref name=VarietyDec2018/><ref name=firstlook /><ref name=\"Clips\">{{cite web |url=https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/ |title=D23: Pixar Brings New Onward Clips |last=White |first=James |date=August 25, 2019 |website=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]] |accessdate=August 26, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190825105550/https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/pixar-onward-chris-pratt-tom-holland/|archive-date=August 25, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the widowed mother of Ian and Barley.\n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as The \"Corey\" Manticore, a [[manticore]] restaurant owner and former adventurer whom Ian and Barley go to for help on their quest.\n* [[Mel Rodriguez]] as Colt Bronco, a [[centaur]] police officer and Laurel's new husband.<ref name=twit3600/>\n* [[Kyle Bornheimer]] as Wilden Lightfoot, Ian and Barley's late father and Laurel's late husband.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Lena Waithe]] as Specter, a [[cyclops]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|title=Disney-Pixar's \"Onward\" Will Feature the First Openly LGBTQ Character|date=February 22, 2020|via=Inside the Magic|access-date=February 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200222040111/https://insidethemagic.net/2020/02/onward-first-openly-lgbtq-bt1/|archive-date=February 22, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|title=Pixar's first out gay character to be voiced by Lena Waithe in 'Onward'|last=Frishberg|first=Hannah|date=February 24, 2020|website=[[New York Post]]|access-date=February 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225133013/https://nypost.com/2020/02/24/pixars-first-out-gay-character-to-be-voiced-by-lena-waithe-in-onward/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Ali Wong]] as Gore, a [[faun]] police officer.<ref name=twit3600>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|title=Behold: Character posters for #PixarOnward, including newly-announced cast @AliWong, @LenaWaithe, and @_MelRodriguez_.\u2728 Check back tomorrow to see the brand-new trailer for the film|via=[[Twitter]]|access-date=December 16, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191217032256/https://twitter.com/pixaronward/status/1206620188709273600|archive-date=December 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Grey DeLisle|Grey Griffin]] as Dewdrop, a [[pixie]] and the leader of the Pixie Dusters [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker gang]].\n* [[Tracey Ullman]] as Grecklin, a [[gremlin]] pawn shop owner.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[Wilmer Valderrama]] as Gaxton, an elf and college friend of Wilden.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* George Psarras as Avel, an elf police officer.<ref name=\"WholeCast\" />\n* [[John Ratzenberger]] as Fenwick, a cyclops construction worker.<ref name=\"WholeCast\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|title=Stars attended the world premiere of Disney Pixar's \"Onward\" at the El Capitan Theatre on Feb. 18, 2020 in Hollywood, Calif.|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=February 21, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221191311/https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-stars-attend-the-world-premiere-of-disney-pixar-onward-20200219-547inowgbnbhxnnziyywj3eu6a-photogallery.html|archive-date=February 21, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Production ==\n===Development===\nIn July 2017, Pixar announced a \"suburban fantasy world\" film at the [[D23 Expo]], with Scanlon directing and Rae producing.<ref name=\"Synopsis\"/> The film was inspired by the death of Scanlon's father, when he and his brother were younger, and their relationship.

Ian and the goat girl come across a booth hosted by three evil mermaids. The mermaids sing their mesmerizing song to lure the two into staying in one of three houses put for rent. Ian tries to silence them with the staff but the spell is too weak. When Ian and the goat girl are finally in a trance, the mermaids place them in one of the houses. The house they are in starts to sink into the ground. \n\nThe goat girl was omitted because the filmmakers want the film to focus on the relationship between Ian and Barley.

Official trailers were released in October and December 2019.\n\n== Lawsuit ==\nIn January 2020, San Francisco tattoo artist Sweet Cecily Daniher filed a copyright lawsuit against Disney, Pixar, and ''Onward'' producer Kori Rae. In September 2018, Pixar rented Daniher's \"Vanicorn\", a van decorated with a unicorn-themed mural, for use in a one-day festival. She learned about the production of ''Onward'' in May 2019 and, after seeing images of the van used by Ian and Barley Lightfoot in the film, came to believe that Pixar had copied the design of the Vanicorn in violation of her rental agreement with the company, as well as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]], the [[Visual Artists Rights Act]], and the California Artists Protection Act. She sought in her suit to prohibit distribution of the film and any infringing advertisements or merchandise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|title=Artist Sues Disney, Pixar Over Unicorn-Adorned Van in 'Onward'|last=Cullins|first=Ashley|date=January 28, 2020|website=The Hollywood Reporter|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200129154442/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/disney-sued-by-artist-unicorn-adorned-van-pixars-onward-1274131|archive-date=January 29, 2020|access-date=February 5, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Box office===\n''Onward'' grossed $61.6 million in the United States and Canada, and $41.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $103.2 million.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> It was speculated the gross for the film was significantly [[Impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic on cinema|affected by the coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |title=Cinema audiences drop dramatically as coronavirus restrictions bite |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200317010316/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/16/coronavirus-cinema-audiences-decline-film-industry |archive-date=March 17, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |title=Box Office: 'Onward' Leads as Coronavirus Stunts North American Sales |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314224942/https://variety.com/2020/film/news/onward-the-hunt-invisible-man-box-office-coronavirus-1203534409/ |archive-date=March 14, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |title=Bloodshot and Onward suffer during worst US box office weekend in 22 years |date=March 16, 2020 |access-date=March 16, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324144029/https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a31659709/onward-box-office-bloodshot-coronavirus-cinemas/ |archive-date=March 24, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nIn the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside ''[[The Way Back (2020 film)|The Way Back]]'' and the wide expansion of ''[[Emma (2020 film)|Emma]]'', and was projected to gross $45\u201350 million from 4,200 theaters in its opening weekend.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |title=Disney-Pixar's 'Onward' Eyes $100M Global Start, Even With Coronavirus Concerns |last=D'Alessandro |first=Anthony |first2=Nancy |last2=Tartaglione |date=March 3, 2020 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |access-date=March 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304013005/https://deadline.com/2020/03/onward-ben-affleck-the-way-back-box-office-coronavirus-1202873492/ |archive-date=March 4, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The film held early advance screenings on February 29, and made $650,000 from 470 theaters.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/#449321631858 |title= Weekend Box Office: 'Onward' Sells Out, 'My Hero Academia' Surprises And 'Wendy' Flops |author= Scott Mendleson |date= March 1, 2020 |accessdate= March 4, 2020 |website= [[Forbes]] |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200303203235/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2020/03/01/onward-pixar-my-hero-academia-impractical-jokers-wendy-weekend-box-office/#449321631858 |archive-date= March 3, 2020 |url-status= live }}</ref> It then made $12.1 million on its first day, including $2 million from Thursday night previews.

The event is held during each February in Winnipeg's French Quarter, [[Saint-Boniface, Manitoba|Saint-Boniface]], and is [[Western Canada]]'s largest winter festival. It celebrates Canada's fur-trading past and unique [[French Canadians|French heritage and culture]] through entertainment, arts and crafts, music, exhibits, and displays.\n\n==History==\n[[File: Festival du Voyageur.

He became the first official Voyageur. Voyageurs are people who promote the festival<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/people/forest_g.shtml|title=Memorable Manitobans: Georges Forest (1924-1990)|website=www.mhs.mb.ca|accessdate=April 24, 2019}}</ref> in 1967. The proposal was put forth to the city of St. Boniface, but the city's offer was insufficient.<ref name=FDVHistory>{{cite web|title=History of Festival du Voyageur inc.|url=http://festivalvoyageur.mb.ca/en/fdv-inc/about-us2/history/|publisher=FDV Inc|accessdate=January 23, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201181904/http://festivalvoyageur.mb.ca/en/fdv-inc/about-us2/history/|archive-date=February 1, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the summer of 1969, the [[mayor]], Ed Turner, and the [[city council]] of Saint-Boniface granted their support under the condition that Festival became an incorporated organization. Judge Robert Trudel became the first president of Festival du/of the Voyageur. \"[[Voyageurs|Voyageur]]\" refers to those who worked for a [[fur trade|fur trading]] company and usually travelled by [[canoe]]. Festival du/of the Voyageur Inc. was incorporated under the [[Companies Act of Manitoba]] on December 18, 1969. It received a city grant of $35,000 but had to give back all profits up to $35,000.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nAt a press conference held January 13, 1970, Mayor Turner announced that the city of Saint-Boniface would present a festival honouring the Voyageur of the fur trading era, in celebration of Manitoba's centennial. The first Festival du/of the Voyageur took place February 26 to March 1, 1970, at Provencher Park, with an estimated attendance of 50,000 people.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Georges Forest was in charge of promoting the event and did so by wearing clothing that represented the Voyageurs. This initiated the tradition of \"Official Voyageurs\", which continues to this day. The 1970 festival lasted four days and featured the walk down Provencher Boulevard, the Governor's Bal and the Voyageur Trading Post.<ref name=FDVHistory/>\n\nA large number of attendees required an unforeseen level of expenditure by festival organizers; by the festival's conclusion, the organization had debt in excess of C$40,000. To remedy their financial situation, the organizers held horse races as a fundraiser in conjunction with the 1971 festival. The 1971 festival was a success, drawing nearly 200,000 guests. However, instead of resolving the financial situation, the fundraiser pushed the organization further into debt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nThe snow sculpture that won the 1971 event was of a pair of boots and a toque. This sculpture inspired the creation of a mascot, L\u00e9o La Tuque, who was introduced in 1972 and became the trademark of Festival du Voyageur.<ref name=FDVHistory/>\n\nGrants from the city of Winnipeg and the Secretary of State allowed the Festival to make arrangements with their creditors. The name was changed to \"Festival du Voyageur\" (the \"of the\" was dropped). For the 1972 festival, Arthur D'Eschambault was elected president. He hired a number of financial and management directors (most of whom were [[English Canadian|anglophone]]). The festival ran from February 21 to 27, and the profits amounted to C$108.46.\n\nTwo \"school\" voyageurs were appointed in 1977, to visit schools and teach children about the voyageurs and Festival.\n\nIn 1977, construction began on wooden log cabins in Whittier Park to accommodate the festival. The log cabins were constructed to be left there year-round. In 1978, the organization had accumulated enough surplus funds to make Whittier Park the permanent site of the festival. Provencher Park had become too small for the growing number of attendees.  These cabins formed the foundation of the historic reconstruction that became known as Fort Gibraltar.<ref name=FDVHistory/>\n\nIn 1981, the Festival du Voyageur purchased an empty warehouse, located at 768 Tach\u00e9 Avenue, for administrative offices and to be used for an additional venue. The building became known as the Rendez-Vous and eventually came to include a bar named Le Canot.<ref name=FDVHistory/>\n\nFrom February to October 2001, a large house was constructed in Fort Gibraltar for the event. The house is called the Maison du Bourgeois.<ref name=FDVHistory/>\n\nThe Rendez-Vous building on Tach\u00e9 was put up for sale in 2003, and sold in 2006. New administrative offices were found in a building at 233 Provencher Avenue, and it came to also feature a store called the Boutique du voyageur.<ref name=FDVHistory/>\n\nIn 2005, a year-round interpretive centre was built in Fort Gibraltar.<ref name=FDVHistory/>\n\nIn 2011, The Festival was awarded the [[Award of Excellence \u2013 Promotion of Linguistic Duality]] by the [[Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages|Commissioner of Official Languages]] [[Graham Fraser]] for its contribution to the vitality of the Franco-Manitoban Community.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chrisd.ca/2012/02/22/festival-du-voyageur-award-of-excellence-promotion-of-linguistic-duality/|title=Festival du Voyageur Receives Linguistic Duality Award {{!}} ChrisD.ca|date=February 22, 2012|work=ChrisD.ca|access-date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Attendance ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Attendance levels at the Festival du Voyageur<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/festival-du-voyageur-attendance-numbers-down-from-last-year-1.2969639|title=Second coldest Festival means fewer daytime visit|publisher=CBC News|access-date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n|2018\n|93,400<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chrisd.ca/?s=festival+du+voyageur&submit=Search|title=You searched for festival du voyageur - ChrisD.ca|website=ChrisD.ca|access-date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|2017\n|94,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chrisd.ca/2017/02/27/festival-du-voyageur-2017-attendance/|title=Festival du Voyageur Sees Dip in Attendance {{!}} ChrisD.ca|date=February 27, 2017|work=ChrisD.ca|access-date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|2016\n|102,000<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/2532479/festival-du-voyageur-attendance-up-13-per-cent-over-last-year/|title=Festival du Voyageur attendance up 13 per cent over last year|work=Global News|access-date=March 14, 2018}}</ref>\n|-\n|2015\n|91,000\n|-\n|2014\n|100,000\n|-\n|2013\n|97,000\n|-\n|2012\n|95,000\n|-\n|2011\n|97,000\n|}\n\n==Current Operation==\n\nFestival du Voyageur Inc. received $438,174 in 2010 from Industry Canada's two-year Marquee Tourism Events Program (MTEP).

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''A'''C Current (A), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''4'''th generation (4). WAM4 though an indigenously produced loco was heavily inspired by French box design and naturally favoured a French TM which was the Alstom made TAO TM.A total of 500 WAM-4 were built at CLW between 1978 and 1983, which made them the most numerous class of mainline electric locomotive till it's successor the [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5.]]\n\nThis class proved so successful by virtue of its ruggedness suitable for Indian conditions and simplicity of maintenance, that IR used this basic design for a number of other locos later ([[Indian locomotive class WCAM 1|WCAM-1]], [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5A]], [[Indian locomotive class WCG-2|WCG-2]], and some [[Indian locomotive class WAP-1|WAP]] models). A single WAM-4 can generally haul up to a 24-coach passenger rake. However, with the advent of new 3-phase locos like WAP - 5 and WAP - 7, the WAM - 4 locomotives were relegated to hauling smaller passenger trains. Also, due to the aging fleet the WAM - 4 locomotives are being rapidly scrapped and withdrawn from mainline duties.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe history of WAM-4 begins in early 1970s with the aim of addressing the shortcomings of the previous [[Indian locomotive class WAM-1|WAM-1]]/[[Indian locomotive class WAM-2/3|2]] and [[Indian Railways WAG class|WAG(1-4)]] classes and remove [[Steam locomotive|steam locomotives]] from IR by a target date of 1990. The WAM1s were not great successes as some of their advanced features were unsuitable for Indian conditions \n\nso the designers at [[Research Design and Standards Organisation|RDSO]] and CLW decided to use the following\n\n* Instead of the Bo-Bo bogies of WAM-1/2, ALCO asymmetric Trimount bogies of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] were provided for better traction and power.\n* Silicon rectifiers with speed control by three series-parallel motor combinations and weak field operation.\n* Auxiliaries from Westinghouse and Kirloskar (compressors), S F India (blowers) and Northey (exhauster)\n* Air brakes for loco and vacuum train brakes fitted as original equipment with [[Rheostatic braking]] also provided\n* MU operation made possible up to 4 units possible.\n\nProduction of these locomotives started in 1970 with #20400 and exactly 500 WAM4s were built in 13 years with #21399 \u201cAnant\u201d being the last one. Production ended on August 3,1983.\n\n== Variants ==\nThis loco class has been seen in many variations, as a lot of workshops and sheds have carried out their own enhancements or modifications to the basic loco design. Although the code indicates a mixed-use loco, most WAM-4's ended up hauling passenger trains. \n\nVariants include\n\n* '''WAM4B or G:''' Freight only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4D''' or '''DB:''' Dual Braked (Air and Vacuum)\n* '''WAM4E:''' Air Brake only (for both loco and train)\n* '''WAM4H:''' Hitachi Traction Motors instead of Alstom\n* '''WAM4P:''' Passenger only (regeared version)\n* '''WAM4/2S3P:''' 2 TMs in Series, 3 in Parallel\n* '''WAM4/6P:''' 6 traction motors permanently in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PE:''' Air braked, 6 TMs perm. in parallel\n* '''WAM4/6PDBHS:''' 6 Traction Motors permanently in parallel, Dual Brakes, High Speed\n* '''WAM-4P D:''' Passenger only (dual brakes)\n*'''WAM-4P DB 6P''' and '''WAM-4 6P D:''' These are for superfast trains\n*'''WAM-4P DB 3P and WAM-4 2S-3P:'''  some superfasts, passengers\n\nThe 'DB' or 'D' generally, but perhaps not always, indicates dual-brake capability. 'HS' may be for 'high speed'.'2S', '3P', '6P', etc. indicate traction motors connected in series or parallel. The WAM-4 has six traction motors, and originally they were wired to be available in different configurations at different power settings. At notches up to 14, all motors were in series (at notch 14 all resistors dropping out); up to notch 21 in series-parallel combinations (three pairs of motors in series, the pairs themselves being in parallel); and further notches with all motors in parallel (at notch 30 all motors are in parallel with resistors dropping out). This is the original configuration of the WCAM-x series of locos too.\n\nThe WAM-4 locos were later reconfigured to have all motors always in parallel (6P variants) or with the three series-connected pairs in parallel (2S 3P variants). Some WAM-4 locos from CLW are thought to have had the 2S 3P configuration right from the start. The 2S 3P configuration was better for the mixed traffic loads especially as it allowed the locos to start hauling larger loads without stalling. With increasing use of the WAM-4 locos for passenger traffic the all-parallel configuration was deemed more desirable since it allowed higher speeds and higher acceleration.Now, most of these are used exclusively for passenger traffic.\n\n== Livery ==\nThis loco has the widest variety of liveries, with each loco shed having its own livery\n\nMost of the WAM-4 locos now have their MU capability disabled as [[Research Design and Standards Organization|RDSO]] disapproves of these locos running MU'd over 100&nbsp;km/h.\n<ref>http://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-loco2e.html</ref>\n\n== Named Locos<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/list?list_type=named&page=10|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster List|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref> ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Named Locos\n!Class\n!Loco Number\n!Name\n!Loco Shed\n!Current status\n!ref\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20401 \n|   <abbr>BIA</abbr>  \n|Rajatabha  \n|Condemned [07/08/2007]  \n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4489?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20420   \n|BZA\n|Sukh Sagar Naveen \n|Scrapped\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4508?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|20615    \n| <abbr>ASN</abbr>  \n|Surubhi \n|Condemned in November 2011\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4703?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21320 \n|<abbr>AJJ</abbr>\n|Garuda \n|Plinthed at Rail Soudha, SWR HQ, Hubli [January 2020]  \n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4908?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21380 \n|<abbr>ASN</abbr> \n|Navchetna  \n|In Inferior service\n|<ref>https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/4968?list_type=named&page=10</ref>\n|-\n|WAM-4\n|21399  \n| <abbr>BSL</abbr> \n|Anant \n|The last WAM-4 ever built.

The model name stands for [[5 ft 6 in gauge railway|broad gauge (W)]], '''A'''C Current (A), '''M'''ixed traffic (M) engine, '''4'''th generation (4). WAM4 though an indigenously produced loco was heavily inspired by French box design and naturally favoured a French TM which was the Alstom made TAO TM.A total of 500 WAM-4 were built at CLW between 1978 and 1983, which made them the most numerous class of mainline electric locomotive till it's successor the [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5.]]\n\nThis class proved so successful by virtue of its ruggedness suitable for Indian conditions and simplicity of maintenance, that IR used this basic design for a number of other locos later ([[Indian locomotive class WCAM 1|WCAM-1]], [[Indian locomotive class WAG-5|WAG-5A]], [[Indian locomotive class WCG-2|WCG-2]], and some [[Indian locomotive class WAP-1|WAP]] models). A single WAM-4 can generally haul up to a 24-coach passenger rake. However, with the advent of new 3-phase locos like WAP - 5 and WAP - 7, the WAM - 4 locomotives were relegated to hauling smaller passenger trains. Also, due to the aging fleet the WAM - 4 locomotives are being rapidly scrapped and withdrawn from mainline duties.\n\n== Origins ==\nThe history of WAM-4 begins in early 1970s with the aim of addressing the shortcomings of the previous [[Indian locomotive class WAM-1|WAM-1]]/[[Indian locomotive class WAM-2/3|2]] and [[Indian Railways WAG class|WAG(1-4)]] classes and remove [[Steam locomotive|steam locomotives]] from IR by a target date of 1990.

In 112 years of football, Florida has played in over 40 [[bowl game]]s; won three national championships ([[1997 Sugar Bowl|1996]], [[2007 BCS National Championship Game|2006]] and [[2009 BCS National Championship Game|2008]]) and eight [[Southeastern Conference]] championships ([[1991 Florida Gators football team|1991]], [[1993 Florida Gators football team|1993]], [[1994 Florida Gators football team|1994]], [[1995 Florida Gators football team|1995]], [[1996 Florida Gators football team|1996]], [[2000 Florida Gators football team|2000]], [[2006 Florida Gators football team|2006]] and [[2008 Florida Gators football team|2008]]) and have produced three [[Heisman Trophy]] winners, more than 90 first-team [[All-American]]s and 50 [[National Football League]] (NFL) first-round [[NFL Draft|draft]] choices.\n\nSince 1906, Florida Football has had 26 head coaches, including three who were inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] for their coaching success. Its first head coach was [[Jack Forsythe|Pee Wee Forsythe]] with [[Dan Mullen]] becoming the Gators' most recent head coach in 2018.\n\nFlorida Football competed for its first several seasons as an [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] before joining the [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] in 1912. They moved to the [[Southern Conference]] in 1922, then left with a dozen other schools to establish the new [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) in 1932. Florida is currently one of fourteen member institutions in the SEC, and the football team has competed in the SEC Eastern Division since the league began divisional play in 1992.\n\nFlorida plays an eight-game SEC schedule, with six games against the other Eastern Division teams: [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]], [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]], [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]], [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]], [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]] and [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]]. The schedule is filled out with an annual game against [[Louisiana State Tigers football|Louisiana State]] and a rotating SEC Western Division team. Until 2003, the Gators also played [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] every season, but contests in the rivalry are now infrequent events as part of the SEC's rotating opponent system.\n\nKey conference rivalries include the annual [[Florida\u2013Georgia football rivalry|Florida\u2013Georgia game]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] (usually around [[Halloween]]), the [[Florida\u2013Tennessee football rivalry|Florida\u2013Tennessee rivalry]] (usually mid-September), and the inter-divisional [[Florida\u2013LSU football rivalry|Florida\u2013LSU rivalry]] with their permanent SEC Western Division foe (in early to mid-October).\n\nFlorida has also played in-state rival [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] every year since 1958, usually facing off in the last game of the regular season. The two teams' emergence as perennial football powers during the 1980s and 1990s helped build the [[Florida\u2013Florida State football rivalry|Florida\u2013Florida State rivalry]] into a game which often has national-title implications. Before 1988, in-state rival [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] was also an annual opponent; due to expanded conference schedules, the [[Florida\u2013Miami football rivalry|Florida\u2013Miami rivalry]] has been renewed only three times in the regular season and twice in bowl games since then. The remaining dates on Florida's regular schedule are filled by non-conference opponents which vary from year to year.\n\n===Home fields===\n{{main|Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium}}\nFlorida's outdoor sports teams initially played most of their homes games at a municipal park near downtown Gainesville. In 1911, the university installed bleachers alongside a grassy area on the north edge of the campus and dubbed it University Athletic Field, which was expanded and renamed [[Fleming Field (Gainesville)|Fleming Field]] in 1915.\n\nThe football program finally moved into a modern stadium in 1930, when the university built 22,000 seat [[Florida Field]] just south of Fleming Field. In 1989, the name was extended to \"Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium\" to honor alumnus and sports benefactor [[Ben Hill Griffin]]. In 2016, former player and coach [[Steve Spurrier]] was honored by having his name added to the name of the field; it is now officially known as \"Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium\". The facility is also commonly known as \"The Swamp\", a nickname that Spurrier coined in 1992, when he was Florida's head ball coach. Florida Field has been renovated and expanded many times over the decades and has a capacity of almost 90,000.\n\nEven after Florida Field was constructed, Florida occasionally scheduled \"home\" game in other cities across the state, most often Tampa or Jacksonville. This practice was common in the early years of the program, when the Gators' home field was smaller and traveling to Gainesville was more difficult. The frequency of these rotating home games had decreased from one or two contests per season in the 1930s to one every few seasons by the 1980s. With the exception of the traditional rivalry game against Georgia, the Gators have not scheduled any home games outside of Gainesville since Florida Field expanded to become the largest football stadium in the state in 1990.\n\n== Conference affiliations ==\nFlorida's football program is a charter member of the [[Southeastern Conference]], which began play in 1933. Before that, the Gators were affiliated with two different conferences after having founded the program without a conference affiliation.<ref name=\"Gitlin2012\">{{cite book|author=Marty Gitlin|title=Florida Gators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aG90xCiBX8QC&pg=PA14|date=1 September 2012|publisher=ABDO Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-61480-310-2|page=14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://digital.la84.org/digital/collection/p17103coll10|title=CONTENTdm|website=digital.la84.org}}</ref><ref>''2009 Southern Conference Football Media Guide'', [http://www.soconsports.com/fls/4000/socon/files/09fbguide/74-77standings.pdf?SPSID=35576&SPID=1781&DB_OEM_ID=4000  Year-by-Year Standings], Southern Conference, Spartanburg, South Carolina, p. 74 (2009).

The 1985 and 1990 teams also finished atop the standings with conference records of 5\u20131 and 6\u20131, respectively, but Florida was ineligible for the championship due to its NCAA probation for rule violations by previous coaching staffs.

They play their home games in [[Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium]] (nicknamed \"The Swamp\") on the university's [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]] campus. The team's current head coach is [[Dan Mullen]]. The Gators have won three [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national championships]] and eight SEC titles in the 112-season history of Florida football.\n{{TOClimit|3}}\n\n==History ==\n{{main|History of Florida Gators football}}\n{{See also|History of the University of Florida|List of Florida Gators football seasons}}\n\nThe University of Florida was established in Gainesville in 1906 and fielded its first official [[varsity (sports)|varsity]] football team [[1906 Florida Gators football team|that fall]]. In 112 years of football, Florida has played in over 40 [[bowl game]]s; won three national championships ([[1997 Sugar Bowl|1996]], [[2007 BCS National Championship Game|2006]] and [[2009 BCS National Championship Game|2008]]) and eight [[Southeastern Conference]] championships ([[1991 Florida Gators football team|1991]], [[1993 Florida Gators football team|1993]], [[1994 Florida Gators football team|1994]], [[1995 Florida Gators football team|1995]], [[1996 Florida Gators football team|1996]], [[2000 Florida Gators football team|2000]], [[2006 Florida Gators football team|2006]] and [[2008 Florida Gators football team|2008]]) and have produced three [[Heisman Trophy]] winners, more than 90 first-team [[All-American]]s and 50 [[National Football League]] (NFL) first-round [[NFL Draft|draft]] choices.\n\nSince 1906, Florida Football has had 26 head coaches, including three who were inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] for their coaching success. Its first head coach was [[Jack Forsythe|Pee Wee Forsythe]] with [[Dan Mullen]] becoming the Gators' most recent head coach in 2018.\n\nFlorida Football competed for its first several seasons as an [[NCAA Division I FBS independent schools|independent]] before joining the [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] in 1912. They moved to the [[Southern Conference]] in 1922, then left with a dozen other schools to establish the new [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) in 1932. Florida is currently one of fourteen member institutions in the SEC, and the football team has competed in the SEC Eastern Division since the league began divisional play in 1992.\n\nFlorida plays an eight-game SEC schedule, with six games against the other Eastern Division teams: [[Georgia Bulldogs football|Georgia]], [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]], [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]], [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]], [[Missouri Tigers football|Missouri]] and [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]]. The schedule is filled out with an annual game against [[Louisiana State Tigers football|Louisiana State]] and a rotating SEC Western Division team. Until 2003, the Gators also played [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] every season, but contests in the rivalry are now infrequent events as part of the SEC's rotating opponent system.\n\nKey conference rivalries include the annual [[Florida\u2013Georgia football rivalry|Florida\u2013Georgia game]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]] (usually around [[Halloween]]), the [[Florida\u2013Tennessee football rivalry|Florida\u2013Tennessee rivalry]] (usually mid-September), and the inter-divisional [[Florida\u2013LSU football rivalry|Florida\u2013LSU rivalry]] with their permanent SEC Western Division foe (in early to mid-October).\n\nFlorida has also played in-state rival [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] every year since 1958, usually facing off in the last game of the regular season. The two teams' emergence as perennial football powers during the 1980s and 1990s helped build the [[Florida\u2013Florida State football rivalry|Florida\u2013Florida State rivalry]] into a game which often has national-title implications. Before 1988, in-state rival [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]] was also an annual opponent; due to expanded conference schedules, the [[Florida\u2013Miami football rivalry|Florida\u2013Miami rivalry]] has been renewed only three times in the regular season and twice in bowl games since then. The remaining dates on Florida's regular schedule are filled by non-conference opponents which vary from year to year.\n\n===Home fields===\n{{main|Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium}}\nFlorida's outdoor sports teams initially played most of their homes games at a municipal park near downtown Gainesville. In 1911, the university installed bleachers alongside a grassy area on the north edge of the campus and dubbed it University Athletic Field, which was expanded and renamed [[Fleming Field (Gainesville)|Fleming Field]] in 1915.\n\nThe football program finally moved into a modern stadium in 1930, when the university built 22,000 seat [[Florida Field]] just south of Fleming Field. In 1989, the name was extended to \"Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium\" to honor alumnus and sports benefactor [[Ben Hill Griffin]]. In 2016, former player and coach [[Steve Spurrier]] was honored by having his name added to the name of the field; it is now officially known as \"Steve Spurrier-Florida Field at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium\". The facility is also commonly known as \"The Swamp\", a nickname that Spurrier coined in 1992, when he was Florida's head ball coach. Florida Field has been renovated and expanded many times over the decades and has a capacity of almost 90,000.\n\nEven after Florida Field was constructed, Florida occasionally scheduled \"home\" game in other cities across the state, most often Tampa or Jacksonville. This practice was common in the early years of the program, when the Gators' home field was smaller and traveling to Gainesville was more difficult. The frequency of these rotating home games had decreased from one or two contests per season in the 1930s to one every few seasons by the 1980s. With the exception of the traditional rivalry game against Georgia, the Gators have not scheduled any home games outside of Gainesville since Florida Field expanded to become the largest football stadium in the state in 1990.\n\n== Conference affiliations ==\nFlorida's football program is a charter member of the [[Southeastern Conference]], which began play in 1933.

Florida's annual conference opponents are Kentucky, Tennessee, Vanderbilt, Georgia, Missouri, and South Carolina, usually scheduled in that order. Most of the Gators' SEC East opponents are played on a home-and-home basis, with Tennessee and Vanderbilt visiting Gainesville in odd numbered years and Kentucky, South Carolina, and Missouri visiting in even numbered years. The [[Florida\u2013Georgia football rivalry|Florida/Georgia game]] is played annually in Jacksonville.\n\n=== SEC West opponents ===\nIn addition to six games against eastern division opponents, Florida plays two games against western division opponents. Florida's permanent non-division opponent is Louisiana State (LSU), whom the Gators play annually.

The [[pre-Celtic]] people, \n[[Celts]] and [[Roman Republic|Romans]] were followed by the invasions of the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] [[Germanic peoples]]. After the [[Muslim]] conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], most of its territory was part of [[Al-Andalus]]. Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian ''[[Reconquista]]''. Founded in 868, the [[County of Portugal]] gained prominence after the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]] (1128). The [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was later proclaimed following the [[Battle of Ourique]] (1139), and independence from [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] was recognised by the [[Treaty of Zamora]] (1143).<ref>Brian Jenkins, Spyros A.

The name of the city is from the Latin word for [[port]] or harbor, ''portus'', but the second element of ''Portus Cale'' is less clear. The mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an [[ethnonym]] derived from the [[Castro culture|Castro people]], also known as the [[Callaeci]], Gallaeci or Gallaecia, who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref> https://www.academia.edu/31989410/Documentos_danca_portuguesa </ref> The names ''cactusi'' and ''Cale'' are the origin of today's ''[[Vila Nova de Gaia|Gaia]]'' and ''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]''.<ref> https://www.academia.edu/10819665/Origem_e_significado_dos_nomes_de_Portugal_e_da_Galiza </ref>\n\nAnother theory has it that Cala was the name of a Celtic goddess (drawing a comparison with the [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] ''[[Cailleach]]'' a supernatural hag). \nA further theory is that ''Cale'' or ''Calle'' is a derivation of the Celtic word for port, like the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''called'' or [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''call''. These explanations, would require the pre-Roman language of the area to have been a branch of Q-Celtic, which is not generally accepted. The region's pre-Roman language was Gallaecian Celtic, however, scholars like Jean Markale andTranoy, propose that the Celtic branches all share the same origin, and placenames such as Cale, Gal, Gaia, Calais, Galatia, Galicia, Gaelic, Gael, Gaul, Wales, Cornwall, Wallonia and others all stem from one linguistic root. <ref> https://www.academia.edu/10819665/Origem_e_significado_dos_nomes_de_Portugal_e_da_Galiza </ref><ref> https://helvia.uco.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10396/2852/9.3.pdf </ref>\n\nSome French scholars believe the name may have come from 'Portus Gallus',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MD8zAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA441&lpg=PA441&dq=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal#v=onepage&q=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal&f=false|title=Manuel g\u00e9ographique et statistique de l'Espagne et du Portugal ...|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Buisson|via=Google Books}}</ref> the port of the Gauls or Celts.\n\nAround 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] during the [[Second Punic War]], and in the process conquered Cale renaming it ''Portus Cale'' (''Port of Cale'') incorporating it to the province of [[Gaelicia|Gaellicia]] with capital in [[Bracara Augusta]] (modern day [[Braga]], Portugal). During the [[Middle Ages]], the region around ''Portus Cale'' became known by the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] as '''''Portucale'''''. The name ''Portucale'' evolved into '''''Portugale''''' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers [[Douro]] and [[Minho River|Minho]]. By the 11th and 12th centuries, ''Portugale'', ''Portugallia'', Portvgallo or ''Portvgalliae'' was already referred to as '''Portugal'''.\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!--many paragraphs without citations-->\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Main|Escoural Cave|History of Portugal}}\n[[File:Rock_Art_Foz_Coa_01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prehistoric Rock Art Sites in the C\u00f4a Valley]].]]\nThe early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] located in South Western Europe. [[The name of Portugal]] derives from the joined Romano-Celtic name [[Portus Cale]]. The region was [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|settled]] by Pre-[[Celts]] and Celts, giving origin to peoples like the [[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]], visited by [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Carthaginians]], incorporated in the [[Roman Republic]] dominions as [[Lusitania]] and part of [[Gallaecia]], after 45 BC until 298 AD.\n\nThe region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by [[Neanderthal]]s and then by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', who roamed the border-less region of the northern Iberian peninsula.<ref name=\"Birmp1\">David Birmingham (2003), p. 11</ref> These were subsistence societies and although they did not establish prosperous settlements, did form organized societies.

Another theory suggests that Celts inhabited Western Iberia / Portugal well before any large Celtic migrations from [[Central Europe]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Celtic from the West. Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature |  url =https://www.academia.edu/7336002 | author= Koch, John&al.}}</ref> In addition, a number of linguists expert in ancient Celtic have presented compelling evidence that the [[Tartessian language]], once spoken in parts of SW Spain and SW Portugal, is at least proto-Celtic in structure.

This designation refers to the characteristic Celtic populations called 'd\u00f9n', 'd\u00f9in' or 'don' in [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] and that the Romans called castrae in their chronicles.\n\nBased on the Roman chronicles about the [[Callaeci]] peoples, along with the [[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/leborgablare01macauoft|title=Lebor gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The book of the taking of Ireland|first=Robert Alexander Stewart|last=Macalister|publisher=Dublin : Published for the Irish texts Society by the Educational Company of Ireland|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> narrations and the interpretation of the abundant archaeological remains throughout the northern half of Portugal and Galicia, it is possible to infer that there was a matriarchal society, with a military and religious aristocracy probably of the feudal type. The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain (chefe tribal), of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, mainly referring to medical and religious functions that could be common to several castros. The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the [[druids]] to meet in councils with the druids of other areas, which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant events.\nThe first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as [[Strabo]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] among others, about the social organization, and describing the inhabitants of these territories, the [[Gallaecia|Gallaeci of Northern Portugal]] as:\n\"A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing under the moon.\"\n\nThere were other similar tribes, and chief among them were the [[Lusitanians]]; the core area of these people lay in inland central Portugal, while numerous other related tribes existed such as the [[Celtici|Celtici of Alentejo]], and the [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve]]. Among the tribes or sub-divisions were the [[Bracari]], [[Coelerni]], [[Equaesi]], [[Grovii]], [[Interamici]], [[Leuni]], [[Luanqui]], [[Limici]], [[Narbasi]], [[Nemetati]], [[Paesuri]], [[Quaquerni]], [[Seurbi]], [[Tamagani]], [[Tapoli]], [[Turduli]], [[Turduli Veteres]], [[Turdulorum Oppida]], [[Turodi]], and [[Zoelae]]. A few small, semi-permanent, commercial coastal settlements (such as [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]]) were also founded in the [[Algarve]] region by [[Phoenicians]]\u2013[[Carthaginians]].\n\n=== Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia ===\n\n{{Main|Lusitania|Gallaecia|Hispania}}\n\n[[File:Evora-RomanTemple edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Temple of \u00c9vora]], in the [[Alentejo]], is one of the best preserved [[Roman civilization|Roman]]-built structures in the country.]]\n\nRomans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's adversary in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies. During the last days of [[Julius Caesar]], almost the entire peninsula was annexed to the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nThe Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and\nthe lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. It suffered a severe setback in 155 BC, when a [[Lusitanian War|rebellion]] began in the north. The [[Lusitanians]] and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]], wrested control of all of western Iberia.\n\n[[File:Torre de Centum Cellas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.92|[[Centum Cellas]], in the [[Beira (Portugal)|Beira region]], is a Roman ''[[villa rustica]]'' from the 1st century CE.]]\n\nRome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion, but to no avail \u2013 the Lusitanians kept conquering territory. The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy. They bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him. In 139 BC, Viriathus was assassinated and [[Tautalus]] became leader of the Lusitanians.\n\nRome installed a colonial regime. The complete Romanization of Lusitania only took place in the [[Visigothic]] era.\n\nIn 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as [[Gallaecia]], with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's [[Braga]].\nThere are still many ruins of castros ([[hill forts]]) throughout modern Portugal and remains of the [[Castro culture]].\nSome urban remains are quite large, like [[Con\u00edmbriga]] and [[Mir\u00f3briga|Mirobriga]]. The former, beyond being one of the largest [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a [[Monuments of Portugal|National Monument]]. Con\u00edmbriga lies {{convert|16|km|abbr=off}} from [[Coimbra]], which in turn was the ancient ''[[Aeminium]]''. The site also has a museum that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations.\n\nSeveral works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres and laymen's homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, some coined in Lusitanian land, as well as numerous pieces of ceramics, were also found.

The [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] was the Germanic post-Roman kingdom, established in the former Roman provinces of [[Gallaecia]]-[[Lusitania]]. 5th-century vestiges of [[Alans|Alan]] settlements were found in [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]] (from old Germanic ''Alan kerk'', ''temple of the Alans''), [[Coimbra]] and Lisbon.<ref>Milhazes, Jos\u00e9.

In 448 Rechila died, leaving the state in expansion to [[Rechiar]].\nAfter the defeat against the Visigoths, the Suebian kingdom was divided, with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously. Both reigned from 456 to 457, the year in which Maldras (457\u2013459) reunified the kingdom to finish being assassinated after a failed Roman-Visigothic conspiracy.\nAlthough the conspiracy did not achieve its true purposes, the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between two kings:\n[[Frumar]] (Frumario 459\u2013463) and [[Remismund]] (Remismundo, son of [[Maldras]]) (459\u2013469) who would re-reunify his father's kingdom in 463 and that he would be forced to adopt [[Arianism]] in 465 due to the Visigoth influence.\nBy the year 500, the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] had been installed in Iberia, it was based in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and advancing westwards. They became a threat to the Suebian rule.\nAfter the death of Remismund in 469 a dark period set in, where virtually all written texts and accounts disappear. This period lasted until 550. The only thing known about this period is that [[Theodemund]] (Teodemundo) most probably ruled the Suebians.\nThe dark period ended with the reign of Karriarico (550\u2013559) who reinstalled [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]] in 550. He was succeed by [[Theodemir (Suebian king)|Theodemar]] (559\u2013570) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga (561) was held.\n\n[[File:Ariamirogaliza.jpg|thumb|left|Illustrated depiction of the [[First Council of Braga]] of 561 CE]]\n\nThe councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory (paroeciam suevorum (Suebian parish) and the [[Christianization]] of the pagan population (''[[De correctione rusticorum]]'') under the auspices of [[Saint Martin of Braga]] (S\u00e3o Martinho de Braga).\n\nAfter the death of Teodomiro, [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] (570\u2013583) was his successor. During his reign, the 2nd Council of Braga (572) was held.\nThe Visigothic civil war began in 577. Miro intervened. Later in 583 he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville. During the return from this failed operation Miro died.\n\nIn the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take place. [[Eborico]] (Eurico, 583\u2013584) was dethroned by [[Andeca]] (Audeca 584\u2013585), who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion led by Leovigildo. The Visigothic invasion, completed in 585, turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth province of the Gothic kingdom.\n[[Leovigild]] was crowned King of Gallaecia, Hispania and [[Gallia Narbonensis]].\n[[File:Cvp-00791-109v.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi King]] [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] and St. [[Martin of Braga]]; c. 1145]]\n\nFor the next 300 years and by the year 700, the entire Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Visigoths.

Both 'governors' [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] and [[Wittiza]] (Vitiza) acted as doge (they would later become kings in Toledo).  These two became known as the 'vitizians', who headquartered in the northwest and called on the Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in 711.\nKing [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing this invasion, thus becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia.\nFrom the various Germanic groups who settled in Western Iberia, the [[Suebi]] left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and western fringes of Asturias.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fim do Imp\u00e9rio Romano e Chegada dos Suevos|url=http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|website=notapositiva.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223112452/http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|archive-date=23 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Suevos|url=http://www.infoescola.com/povos-germanicos/suevos/|website=infoescola.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vest\u00edgios da presen\u00e7a sueva no noroeste da pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica: na etnologia, na arqueologia e na l\u00edngua|url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0807-89672013000200016|website=scielo.mec.pt|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref>\nAccording to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal.\nBracara Augusta, the modern city of [[Braga]] and former capital of [[Gallaecia]], became the capital of the Suebi.

This rule lasted from some decades in the North to five centuries in the South.\n\nAfter defeating the [[Visigoths]] in only a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of [[Damascus]], which stretched from the [[Indus]] river in the Indian sub-continent up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]] with the establishment of the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]]. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called [[Taifa]] kingdoms.\n\n[[File:Portugal DSC04496 - MERTOLA (34025572830).jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi]] outside the [[Castle of M\u00e9rtola]], in the [[Alentejo]]]]\n\nThe governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves [[Emir]] of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north.

One of the first cities Vimara Peres founded at this time is Vimaranes, known today as [[Guimar\u00e3es]] \u2013 the \"birthplace of the Portuguese nation\" or the \"cradle city\" (Cidade Ber\u00e7o in Portuguese).<ref name=\"QuidNovi\"/>\n\nAfter annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] knighted V\u00edmara Peres, in 868, as the First Count of Portus Cale (Portugal). The region became known as ''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', and simultaneously ''Portug\u00e1lia'' \u2013 the [[County of Portugal]].<ref name=\"QuidNovi\"/>\n\nLater the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of Christian Kingdoms in Northern Iberia due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the king's offspring. With the forced abdication of [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III \"the Great\" of Asturias]] by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 under the crown of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]].\n\nIn 1093, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n]] bestowed the county to [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] and married him to his daughter, [[Teresa of Le\u00f3n, Countess of Portugal|Teresa of Le\u00f3n]], for his role in reconquering the land from Moors.

This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal, as a fief of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, was transformed into the independent [[Kingdom of Portugal]].\n\nAfonso then established the first of the [[Portuguese Cortes]] at [[Lamego]], where he was crowned by the Archbishop of Braga, though the validity of the Cortes of Lamego has been disputed and called a myth created during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]].

Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], pushed southward to drive out the Moors. At this time, Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]] and complete expulsion of the last Moorish settlements on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present-day borders, with minor exceptions.\n\nIn one of these situations of conflict with the [[kingdom of Castile]], [[Dinis I of Portugal]] signed with the king [[Fernando IV of Castile]] (who was represented, when a minor, by his mother the queen [[Maria de Molina]]) the [[Treaty of Alca\u00f1ices (1297)]], which stipulated that Portugal abolished agreed treaties against the kingdom of Castile for supporting the infant [[Juan de Castilla]].

The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Mary Anne of Austria|Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria]], was fond of Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]], however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son, Joseph I of Portugal, was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the [[Queen Mother]]'s approval, he appointed Melo as [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs.\n\nAs the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo was made Prime Minister. Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from his time as an Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India, reorganized the army and the navy, restructured the [[University of Coimbra]], and ended discrimination against different [[Christianity|Christian]] sects in Portugal.\n\nSebasti\u00e3o de Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Ruinas da Pra\u00e7a da Patriarcal ap\u00f3s o Terramoto de 1755 - Jacques Philippe Le Bas, 1757.png  |width1= 1012 |height1= 716\n| image3 = Ruinas da Igreja de S.

We bury the dead and take care of the living.\"\n\nDespite the calamity and huge [[death toll]], Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt. The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes. Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline City Centre still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of [[seismology]] by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] gave his Prime Minister even more power, and Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo became a powerful, progressive dictator. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]] and the [[Dukes of Aveiro|Duke of Aveiro]] were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo prosecuted every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy. Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in 1759.\n\nIn 1762, [[Spanish\u2013Portuguese War, 1761\u20131763|Spain invaded Portuguese territory]] as part of the [[Seven Years' War]], but by 1763 the ''status quo'' between Spain and Portugal before the war had been restored.\n\nFollowing the T\u00e1vora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Made \"Marquis of Pombal\" in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1779.\n\nThe new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], disliked the Marquis because of the power he amassed, and never forgave him for the ruthlessness with which he dispatched the T\u00e1vora family, and upon her accession to the throne, she withdrew all his political offices. The Marquis of Pombal died on his estate at [[Pombal, Portugal|Pombal]] in 1782.\n\nHowever, historians also argue that Pombal's \"enlightenment,\" while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.<ref>Kenneth Maxwell, ''Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 83, 91\u2013108, 160\u201362.</ref>\n\n=== Napoleonic era ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1777\u20131834)|United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | footer =\n | image1 = Embarque da Fam\u00edlia Real para o Brasil - Nicolas-Louis-Albert Delerive, attrib.

This decline was hastened by the [[independence of Brazil]], the country's largest colonial possession.\n\nIn the autumn of 1807, [[Napoleon]] moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal. From 1807 to 1811, British-Portuguese forces would successfully fight against the French invasion of Portugal in the [[Peninsular War]], during which the royal family and the Portuguese [[nobility]], including Maria I, relocated to the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese territory of Brazil]], at that time a colony of the [[Portuguese Empire]], in South America. This episode is known as the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]].\n\nIn 1807, as Napoleon's army closed in on Lisbon, [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal]], the [[Prince Regent]], transferred his court to Brazil and established [[Rio de Janeiro]] as the capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it, forming a pluricontinental state, the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]].\n\n[[File:Portuguese Constitution of 1826.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The frontispiece of the 1826 Portuguese Constitution featuring King-Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro IV]] and his daughter Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]]]\nAs a result of the change in its status and the arrival of the Portuguese royal family, Brazilian administrative, civic, [[Economic history of Brazil#The economy at independence, 1822|economical]], military, [[Education in Brazil#History|educational]], and [[Brazilian science and technology#History|scientific]] apparatus were expanded and highly modernized. Portuguese and their allied British troops fought against the [[French Invasion of Portugal]] and by 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that Jo\u00e3o VI would have been able to return safely to Lisbon. However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]], which started in [[Porto]], demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.\n\nThus he returned to Portugal but left his son [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] in charge of Brazil. When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] from Portugal. [[Cisplatina]] (today's sovereign state of Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.\n\nBrazilian independence was recognized in 1825, whereby Emperor Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of ''Emperor of Brazil''. John VI's death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession. Though Pedro was his heir, and reigned briefly as Pedro IV, his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations. Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] (Mary II). However, Pedro's brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Infante Miguel]], claimed the throne in protest. After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed, Miguel seized power as King Miguel I, in 1828. In order to defend his daughter's rights to the throne, Pedro launched the [[Portuguese Civil War|Liberal Wars]] to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The war ended in 1834, with Miguel's defeat, the promulgation of a constitution, and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II.\n\n=== Constitutional monarchy ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1834\u20131910)}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = O Regic\u00eddio por Haenen (2).jpg\n | image2 = Aclama\u00e7\u00e3o de Dom Manuel II.jpg\n | image3 = Proclama\u00e7\u00e3o Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa.jpg\n | footer = Top to bottom: The [[Lisbon Regicide]] (1908), [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]]'s acclamation as King (1908) and the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Proclamation of the Republic]] (1910)\n }}\nQueen Maria II (Mary II) and King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II]]'s son, King [[Pedro V]] (Peter V) modernized the country during his short reign (1853\u20131861). Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the [[cholera]] outbreak of 1853\u20131856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro's reign was short, as he died of cholera in 1861, after a series of deaths in the royal family, including his two brothers [[Infante Fernando of Portugal|Infante Fernando]] and [[Infante Jo\u00e3o, Duke of Beja]], and his wife, [[Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]]. Pedro not having children, his brother, [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal]] (Louis I) ascended the throne and continued his modernization.\n\nAt the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia. [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]], [[Bissau]], [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]], [[Porto Amboim]] and the [[Island of Mozambique]] were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.\n\nWith the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Conference of Berlin]] of 1884, Portuguese territories in Africa had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Portuguese towns and cities in Africa like [[Nova Lisboa]], [[Lubango|S\u00e1 da Bandeira]], [[Kuito|Silva Porto]], [[Malanje]], [[Tete]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Vila Pery]] and [[Vila Cabral]] were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Namibe|Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes]], [[Lobito]], [[Jo\u00e3o Belo]], [[Nacala]] and [[Porto Am\u00e9lia]] were also founded. Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks as the [[Benguela railway]] in Angola, and the [[Beira railway]] in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.\n\nOther episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the [[1890 British Ultimatum]]. This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its \"[[Pink Map]]\", which clashed with British aspirations to create a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]].\n\nThe Portuguese territories in Africa were [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. The tiny fortress of [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]] on the coast of [[Dahomey]], was also under Portuguese rule. In addition, Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]] and [[Portuguese Macau]].\n\nOn February 1, 1908, King Dom [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his [[heir apparent]] and his eldest son, [[Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Prince Royal Dom Lu\u00eds Filipe]], [[Duke of Braganza]], [[Lisbon Regicide|were assassinated in Lisbon]] in the [[Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]] by two Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries, [[Alfredo Lu\u00eds da Costa]] and [[Manuel Bu\u00ed\u00e7a]]. Under his rule, Portugal had been declared [[bankrupt]]&nbsp;twice \u2013 first on June 14, 1892, and then again on May 10, 1902&nbsp;\u2013 causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, angry protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. His second and youngest son, [[Manuel II of Portugal]], became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the [[5 October 1910 revolution|5 October 1910 Portuguese republican revolution]], which abolished the monarchy and installed a [[republic]]an government in Portugal, causing him and his royal family to flee into [[exile]] in [[London]], [[England]].\n\n=== First Republic and Estado Novo ===\n[[File:Bernardino Machado, Te\u00f3filo Braga, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida e Afonso Costa, ap\u00f3s uma sess\u00e3o solene do Parlamento em homenagem aos mortos da revolu\u00e7\u00e3o republicana, 1911.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Left to right: President [[Bernardino Machado]], President [[Te\u00f3filo Braga]], President [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida]], and Prime Minister [[Afonso Costa]]; 1911]]\n{{Main|Portuguese First Republic|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}\nThe new republic had many problems. Portugal had 45 different governments in just 15 years. During [[World War I|World War 1]] (1914\u20131918), Portugal helped the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] fight the [[Central Powers]]. But the war hurt its weak economy. Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[Portuguese First Republic]]. These conditions would lead to the failed [[Monarchy of the North]], [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]], and the creation of the National Dictatorship (''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'').\nThis in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] under [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933.\n\nPortugal remained neutral in [[World War II]].\nFrom the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], as the largest and richest overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's status as a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] nation and not as a colonial empire.\n\nAfter India attained independence in 1947, pro-Indian residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organisations, separated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954.<ref name =lele>P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,</ref> In 1961, [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire.\n[[File:Antonio Salazar-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1968, within the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.]]\nAccording to the census of 1921 S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty.\n\nAnother forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]].\n\nThe [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations resulted in the defeat]] and surrender of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in Portugal's National Assembly until the military coup of 1974.\n\nAlso in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974).\n\nThroughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. However, the authoritarian and conservative [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, first installed and governed by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and from 1968 onwards led by [[Marcelo Caetano]], tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |title=Portugal N\u00e3o \u00c9 Um Pa\u00eds Pequeno |publisher=Purl.pt |accessdate=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141025060609/http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |archivedate=25 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Carnation Revolution and European integration ===\n{{Main|Carnation Revolution|Portuguese transition to democracy}}\n[[File:Portuguese colonial war blank map.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Portuguese Africa]] before independence in 1975]]\nThe Portuguese government and army resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in Lisbon, known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso]]''). This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]).<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], ''[[The Economist]]'', 16 August 1975</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 7 July 1975</ref>\n\nOver one million [[White African#Portuguese in Africa|Portuguese refugees]] fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. [[M\u00e1rio Soares]] and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] were charged with organising the independence of Portugal's overseas territories. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|its first democratic elections]] in 50 years.\n\nPortugal continued to be governed by a [[Junta de Salva\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional]] until the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]]. It was won by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]] (PS) and M\u00e1rio Soares, its leader, became Prime Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July. M\u00e1rio Soares would be Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985. In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution, during the last decade of the previous regime. He initiated the process of accession to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) by starting accession negotiations as early as 1977.\n[[File:Portugese minister Soares (voorzitter Socialistische Partij) op Schiphol aangeko, Bestanddeelnr 927-7110.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[M\u00e1rio Soares]] became Portugal's first democratically elected Prime-Minister in 1976.]]\nPortugal bounced between [[socialism]] and adherence to the [[neoliberal]] model. [[Land reform]] and [[nationalization]]s were enforced; the [[Portuguese Constitution]] (approved in 1976) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution was a document with numerous references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a [[socialist economy]]. Portugal's economic situation after its transition to democracy, obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilization programs in 1977\u201378 and 1983\u201385.\n\nIn 1986, Portugal joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that later became the European Union (EU). In the following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU [[structural and cohesion funds]] and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets.\n\nPortugal's last overseas and Asian colonial territory, [[Macau]], was peacefully handed over to the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] on December 20, 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of [[East Timor]] (Asia) was formally recognized by Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation Revolution, but interrupted by an [[Indonesia]]n armed invasion and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]].\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, when Portugal held the presidency for the [[European Council]].]]\nOn 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states. In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon. In 1996, [[Jorge Sampaio]] became president. He won [[2001 Portuguese presidential election|re-election]] in January 2001. [[Expo '98]] took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and the [[eurozone]]. On July 5, 2004, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]], then [[Prime Minister of Portugal]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]], the most powerful office in the European Union. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action. The [[Republic of Ireland]] was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. It was initially rejected by voters in 2008.\n\nEconomic disruption and an unsustainable growth in [[government debt]] during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (EFSM) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF), a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.\n\n== Geography ==\n<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: \"Geography of Portugal\" and \"Protected areas of Portugal\", your work there will be very appreciated. -->\n{{Main|Geography of Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer =\n | image1 = Portugal topographic map-pt.png\n | caption1 = Topography and administration.\n }}\nThe territory of Portugal includes an area on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (referred to as ''the continent'' by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores.

Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss, pollution and drought. Up-welling along the west coast of Portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish; the Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world. [[Marine fish]] species are more common, and include thousands of species, such as the [[sardine]] (''Sardina pilchardus''), [[tuna]] and [[Atlantic mackerel]].

Elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[Closed list|closed]] [[party-list proportional representation]], deputies serve four-year terms of office, unless the President dissolves the Assembly and calls for new elections.\n\nCurrently the Government ([[Socialist Party (Portugal)|PS]]) and the parties supporting it through a [[Confidence and supply|confidence-and-supply agreement]] ([[Left Bloc|BE]], [[Portuguese Communist Party|PCP]], [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"|PEV]]) control parliament with the most seats.

The main laws include the Constitution (1976, as amended), the [[Portuguese Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code of Portugal]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended).\n\nThe supreme national courts are the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Portugal)|Supreme Court of Justice]] and the [[Constitutional Court of Portugal|Constitutional Court]]. The [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]], headed by the Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors.\n\nPortuguese laws were applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continue to be major influences for those countries.\n\nPortugal was the first country in the world to abolish [[life imprisonment]] (in 1884) and was one of the first countries to [[Capital punishment in Portugal|abolish the death penalty]]. Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years.\n\nPortugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001, the first country in the world to do so. Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including [[cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[LSD]]. While possession is legal, trafficking and possession of more than \"10 days worth of personal use\" are still punishable by jail time and fines. People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with the number of [[HIV]] infection cases, which had dropped 50 percent by 2009. Drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined, however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group.<ref>Brian Vastag [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization 5 Years After: Portugal's Drug Decriminalization Policy Shows Positive Results].

New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal's distribution system is also now a two-way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like rooftop solar panels. The government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Portugal|}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = Viana_do_Castelo,_Portugal_(4922364383).jpg\n | image2 = Fado1 - Fadistas a los Jeronimos.JPG\n | footer = Young people in traditional attire from [[Minho (province)|Minho]] (top) and [[Fado|fadistas]] playing at [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] (bottom)\n }}\nThe Statistics Portugal ({{lang-pt|INE \u2013 [[Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]]}}) estimates that, according to the 2011 census, the population was 10,562,178 (of which 52% was female, 48% was male). In 2018 and according to more up-to-date figures, the population decreased to 10,276,617.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> This population has been relatively homogeneous for most of its history: a single religion (Roman Catholicism) and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and national unity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html |title=Portugal |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>\nMinorities of ''Crist\u00e3os Novos'' (New Christians) nevertheless, stayed in Portugal after converting to Catholicism. A very small number of former Jews may have continued to observe rabbinic Judaism in secret over many generations, namely the [[History of the Jews in Belmonte|Jews of Belmonte]], a town in the interior; where people now observe the [[Jewish]] faith openly. Some famous Portuguese New Christians were the mathematician [[Pedro Nunes]] and the physician and naturalist [[Garcia de Orta]]. Another interesting demographic feature relates to the Scandinavian expansion towards the West and strong activity in Northern Portugal where some coastline communities kept [[Scandinavia]]n ancestry in [[Aveiro District|Aveiro]], [[Porto District|Porto]] and [[Braga District|Braga]] regions.\n\nThe most important demographic influence in the modern Portuguese seems to be the oldest one; current interpretation of [[Y-chromosome]] and [[mtDNA]] data suggests that the Portuguese have their origin in [[Paleolithic]] peoples that began arriving to the European continent around 45,000 years ago. All subsequent migrations did leave an impact, genetically and culturally, but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic. Genetic studies show Portuguese populations not to be significantly different from other European populations.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmc=1852743 | year=2007 | last1=Bauchet | first1=M | last2=McEvoy | first2=B | last3=Pearson | first3=LN | last4=Quillen | first4=EE | last5=Sarkisian | first5=T | last6=Hovhannesyan | first6=K | last7=Deka | first7=R | last8=Bradley | first8=DG | last9=Shriver | first9=MD | title=Measuring European Population Stratification with Microarray Genotype Data | volume=80 | issue=5 | pages=948\u2013956 | journal=American Journal of Human Genetics | doi=10.1086/513477 | pmid=17436249 }}</ref> Portuguese people have a preponderancy of genetics (Iron Age Period)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eupedia.com/europe/autosomal_maps_dodecad.shtml|title=Eupedia Autosomal Maps|last=|first=|date=|website=Eupedia.com|access-date=}}</ref> which belong to R1b haplogroup family along with [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]], [[Alpine states|Alpine]] and [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] genetical markers.

Galicia is a consultative observer of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]].\n\nThe Portuguese language is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] spoken by the [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]] [[pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula]] around 2000 years ago \u2013 particularly the [[Celts]],<ref> https://www.academia.edu/10819665/Origem_e_significado_dos_nomes_de_Portugal_e_da_Galiza </ref> [[Conii]],<ref> https://www.academia.edu/3405973/Algumas_observa\u00e7\u00f5es_sobre_a_escrita_do_Sudoeste </ref> [[Lusitanians]]<ref> https://www.academia.edu/31989410/Documentos_danca_portuguesa </ref> and [[Turduli]].<ref> https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LXJQAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA117&lpg=RA1-PA117&dq=turdulos+origem+academia&source=bl&ots=0RaAScg92U&sig=ACfU3U3DxNJB-caxjSxe7mlw_gu6OsM12w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_kojpmOPoAhVrUxUIHcanDB4Q6AEwAXoECBIQLA#v=onepage&q=turdulos%20origem%20academia&f=false </ref>\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the language spread worldwide as Portugal established a colonial and commercial empire between 1415 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portugueselanguage.net/portuguese/history.asp|title=History of the Portuguese|website=Portugueselanguage.net|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\nPortuguese is spoken as a native language in five different continents, with Brazil accounting for the largest number of native Portuguese speakers of any country.\nIn 2013 the Portuguese language is the official language spoken in Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, and [[East Timor]]. These countries, plus [[Macau]] Special Administrative Region (People's Republic of China) where Portuguese is co-official with [[Cantonese]], make up the [[Lusosphere]], a term derived from the ancient [[Roman province]] of \"[[Lusitania]]\", which currently matches the Portuguese territory south of the [[Douro]] river.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:id=lusitania-geo|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854), Labanae Aquae\u00b4NIA|website=Tufts.edu|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] is also recognized as a co-official regional language in some municipalities of North-Eastern Portugal.

In addition to being a destination for [[international student]]s, Portugal is also among the top places of origin for international students. All higher education students, both domestic and international, totaled 380,937 in 2005.\n[[File:University of Evora (36815429156).jpg|thumb|252x252px|[[University of \u00c9vora|University of Evora]], Portugal's second oldest university.]]\nPortuguese universities have existed since 1290. The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]]<ref> https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-coimbra </ref> was first established in Lisbon before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Historically, within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the [[Americas]] (the ''[[Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortifica\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenho]]'' of [[Rio de Janeiro]]) in 1792, as well as the oldest medical college in Asia (the ''[[Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica de Goa|Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica]]'' of [[Goa]]) in 1842. Presently, the largest university in Portugal is the [[University of Lisbon]].\n\nThe [[Bologna process]] has been adopted by Portuguese universities and poly-technical institutes in 2006. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of ''[[numerus clausus]]'' is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), [[international students]], foreign students from the [[Lusosphere]], degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions ([[Transfer admissions in the United States|academic transfer]]), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.\n\nMost student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students (many as part-time students or in evening classes) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).\n\nPortugal has entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other US institutions]] to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.\n\n=== Health ===\n{{Main|Health in Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align    = right\n | image1 = Miragaia-Rua do Prof. Vicente Jose de Carvalho-Hospital Sto.

The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 25% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 10% by private insurance schemes and another 7% by mutual funds.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS. Five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives, developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, however, the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care.\n\nThe SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.\n[[File:FCM-UNL.JPG|thumb|left|The Medical Department of the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]]]]\nSimilar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from [[noncommunicable diseases]]. Mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]] (CVD) is higher than in the [[eurozone]], but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with [[cerebrovascular disease]] being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%). Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer are more frequent.\nPortugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.\n\nPortugal's [[infant mortality rate]] is around 2 deaths per 1000 newborns, with 2.4 deaths per 1000 live births.\n\nPeople are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health, and their use of health care services. Yet their perceptions of their health, can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations. Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at household level, complement other data on health status and the use of services.\n\nOnly one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |title=Highlights on health in Portugal 2004 |accessdate=25 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201122536/http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |archivedate=1 December 2009 }}.

Two other popular fish recipes are grilled [[sardines]] and [[caldeirada]], a tomato-based [[stew]] that can be made from several types of fish with a mix of onion, garlic, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, parsley or [[coriander]]. Typical Portuguese meat recipes made out of beef, pork, lamb, goat or chicken include ''[[cozido \u00e0 portuguesa]]'', ''[[feijoada]]'', ''[[frango de churrasco]]'', ''leit\u00e3o'' (roast [[suckling pig]]), ''[[chanfana]]'' and ''[[carne de porco \u00e0 alentejana]]''. A very popular northern dish is [[dobrada]], a tripe with white beans and carrots stew, often served with steamed white rice.  [[Piri-piri]] chicken is a spicy charcoal chicken dish served with rice and vegetables, a favourite throughout Portugal, but most common in the [[Algarve]] region.\n[[File: MargaretCafe PasteisDeNata.JPG|thumb|right|Pasteis de Nata in [[Lisboa]]]]\nTypical fast food dishes include the [[Francesinha]] (Frenchie) from Porto, \"Tripas \u00e0 moda do Porto\" which is also a traditional plate from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork) or ''prego'' (grilled beef) [[sandwich]]es, which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in the many [[medieval]] Catholic monasteries spread widely across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly almonds, [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]], flour, eggs and some liquor), managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries, of which [[past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m]] (or ''past\u00e9is de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and ''[[ovos moles]]'' from Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a culture of good food, and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and typical small ''tasquinhas''.\n\nPortuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the times of the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today, the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do D\u00e3o]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]], and the [[Moscatel]] from [[Set\u00fabal]] and [[Favaios]].

The traditional one is the Portuguese folk music which has deep roots in local customs having as instruments [[bagpipes]] (''[[Gaita (bagpipe)|gaita]]'') , drums, flutes, tambourines, accordions and ukuleles (''[[cavaquinho]]''). Within Portuguese folk music is the renowned genre of [[Fado]], a melancholic urban music originated in [[Lisbon]] in the 19th century, probably inside bohemian environments, usually associated with the [[Portuguese guitar]] and ''saudade'', or longing. [[Coimbra fado]], a unique type of \"[[troubadour]] serenading\" fado, is also noteworthy. Internationally notable performers include [[Am\u00e1lia Rodrigues]], [[Carlos Paredes]], [[Jos\u00e9 Afonso]], [[Mariza]], [[Carlos do Carmo]], [[Ant\u00f3nio Chainho]], [[M\u00edsia]], [[Dulce Pontes]] and [[Madredeus]].\n\nIn the classical music domain, Portugal is represented by names as the pianists [[Artur Pizarro]], [[Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires]], [[Sequeira Costa]], the violinists Carlos Damas, [[Gerardo Ribeiro]] and in the past by the great cellist [[Guilhermina Suggia]]. Notable composers include [[Jos\u00e9 Vianna da Motta]], [[Carlos Seixas]], [[Jo\u00e3o Domingos Bomtempo]], [[Jo\u00e3o de Sousa Carvalho]], [[Lu\u00eds de Freitas Branco]] and his student [[Joly Braga Santos]], [[Fernando Lopes-Gra\u00e7a]], [[Emmanuel Nunes]] and [[S\u00e9rgio Azevedo]].

Out of the summer season, Portugal has a large number of festivals, designed more to an urban audience, like Flowfest or Hip Hop Porto. Furthermore, one of the largest international [[Goa trance]] festivals takes place in central Portugal every two years, the Boom Festival, that is also the only festival in Portugal to win international awards: European Festival Award 2010 \u2013 Green'n'Clean Festival of the Year and the Greener Festival Award Outstanding 2008 and 2010.

The [[pre-Celtic]] people, \n[[Celts]] and [[Roman Republic|Romans]] were followed by the invasions of the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] [[Germanic peoples]]. After the [[Muslim]] conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], most of its territory was part of [[Al-Andalus]]. Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian ''[[Reconquista]]''. Founded in 868, the [[County of Portugal]] gained prominence after the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]] (1128). The [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was later proclaimed following the [[Battle of Ourique]] (1139), and independence from [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] was recognised by the [[Treaty of Zamora]] (1143).<ref>Brian Jenkins, Spyros A.

The name of the city is from the Latin word for [[port]] or harbor, ''portus'', but the second element of ''Portus Cale'' is less clear. The mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an [[ethnonym]] derived from the [[Castro culture|Castro people]], also known as the [[Callaeci]], Gallaeci or Gallaecia, who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula.<ref> https://www.academia.edu/31989410/Documentos_danca_portuguesa </ref> The names ''cactusi'' and ''Cale'' are the origin of today's ''[[Vila Nova de Gaia|Gaia]]'' and ''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]''.<ref> https://www.academia.edu/10819665/Origem_e_significado_dos_nomes_de_Portugal_e_da_Galiza </ref>\n\nAnother theory has it that Cala was the name of a Celtic goddess (drawing a comparison with the [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] ''[[Cailleach]]'' a supernatural hag). \nA further theory is that ''Cale'' or ''Calle'' is a derivation of the Celtic word for port, like the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''called'' or [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''call''. These explanations, would require the pre-Roman language of the area to have been a branch of Q-Celtic, which is not generally accepted. The region's pre-Roman language was Gallaecian Celtic, however, scholars like Jean Markale andTranoy, propose that the Celtic branches all share the same origin, and placenames such as Cale, Gal, Gaia, Calais, Galatia, Galicia, Gaelic, Gael, Gaul, Wales, Cornwall, Wallonia and others all stem from one linguistic root. <ref> https://www.academia.edu/10819665/Origem_e_significado_dos_nomes_de_Portugal_e_da_Galiza </ref><ref> https://helvia.uco.es/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10396/2852/9.3.pdf </ref>\n\nSome French scholars believe the name may have come from 'Portus Gallus',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MD8zAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA441&lpg=PA441&dq=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal#v=onepage&q=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal&f=false|title=Manuel g\u00e9ographique et statistique de l'Espagne et du Portugal ...|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Buisson|via=Google Books}}</ref> the port of the Gauls or Celts.\n\nAround 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] during the [[Second Punic War]], and in the process conquered Cale renaming it ''Portus Cale'' (''Port of Cale'') incorporating it to the province of [[Gaelicia|Gaellicia]] with capital in [[Bracara Augusta]] (modern day [[Braga]], Portugal). During the [[Middle Ages]], the region around ''Portus Cale'' became known by the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] as '''''Portucale'''''. The name ''Portucale'' evolved into '''''Portugale''''' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers [[Douro]] and [[Minho River|Minho]]. By the 11th and 12th centuries, ''Portugale'', ''Portugallia'', Portvgallo or ''Portvgalliae'' was already referred to as '''Portugal'''.\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!--many paragraphs without citations-->\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Main|Escoural Cave|History of Portugal}}\n[[File:Rock_Art_Foz_Coa_01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prehistoric Rock Art Sites in the C\u00f4a Valley]].]]\nThe early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] located in South Western Europe. [[The name of Portugal]] derives from the joined Romano-Celtic name [[Portus Cale]]. The region was [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|settled]] by Pre-[[Celts]] and Celts, giving origin to peoples like the [[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]], visited by [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Carthaginians]], incorporated in the [[Roman Republic]] dominions as [[Lusitania]] and part of [[Gallaecia]], after 45 BC until 298 AD.\n\nThe region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by [[Neanderthal]]s and then by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', who roamed the border-less region of the northern Iberian peninsula.<ref name=\"Birmp1\">David Birmingham (2003), p. 11</ref> These were subsistence societies and although they did not establish prosperous settlements, did form organized societies.

Another theory suggests that Celts inhabited Western Iberia / Portugal well before any large Celtic migrations from [[Central Europe]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Celtic from the West. Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature |  url =https://www.academia.edu/7336002 | author= Koch, John&al.}}</ref> In addition, a number of linguists expert in ancient Celtic have presented compelling evidence that the [[Tartessian language]], once spoken in parts of SW Spain and SW Portugal, is at least proto-Celtic in structure.

This designation refers to the characteristic Celtic populations called 'd\u00f9n', 'd\u00f9in' or 'don' in [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] and that the Romans called castrae in their chronicles.\n\nBased on the Roman chronicles about the [[Callaeci]] peoples, along with the [[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/leborgablare01macauoft|title=Lebor gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The book of the taking of Ireland|first=Robert Alexander Stewart|last=Macalister|publisher=Dublin : Published for the Irish texts Society by the Educational Company of Ireland|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> narrations and the interpretation of the abundant archaeological remains throughout the northern half of Portugal and Galicia, it is possible to infer that there was a matriarchal society, with a military and religious aristocracy probably of the feudal type. The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain (chefe tribal), of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, mainly referring to medical and religious functions that could be common to several castros. The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the [[druids]] to meet in councils with the druids of other areas, which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant events.\nThe first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as [[Strabo]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] among others, about the social organization, and describing the inhabitants of these territories, the [[Gallaecia|Gallaeci of Northern Portugal]] as:\n\"A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing under the moon.\"\n\nThere were other similar tribes, and chief among them were the [[Lusitanians]]; the core area of these people lay in inland central Portugal, while numerous other related tribes existed such as the [[Celtici|Celtici of Alentejo]], and the [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve]]. Among the tribes or sub-divisions were the [[Bracari]], [[Coelerni]], [[Equaesi]], [[Grovii]], [[Interamici]], [[Leuni]], [[Luanqui]], [[Limici]], [[Narbasi]], [[Nemetati]], [[Paesuri]], [[Quaquerni]], [[Seurbi]], [[Tamagani]], [[Tapoli]], [[Turduli]], [[Turduli Veteres]], [[Turdulorum Oppida]], [[Turodi]], and [[Zoelae]]. A few small, semi-permanent, commercial coastal settlements (such as [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]]) were also founded in the [[Algarve]] region by [[Phoenicians]]\u2013[[Carthaginians]].\n\n=== Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia ===\n\n{{Main|Lusitania|Gallaecia|Hispania}}\n\n[[File:Evora-RomanTemple edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Temple of \u00c9vora]], in the [[Alentejo]], is one of the best preserved [[Roman civilization|Roman]]-built structures in the country.]]\n\nRomans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's adversary in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies. During the last days of [[Julius Caesar]], almost the entire peninsula was annexed to the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nThe Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and\nthe lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. It suffered a severe setback in 155 BC, when a [[Lusitanian War|rebellion]] began in the north. The [[Lusitanians]] and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]], wrested control of all of western Iberia.\n\n[[File:Torre de Centum Cellas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.92|[[Centum Cellas]], in the [[Beira (Portugal)|Beira region]], is a Roman ''[[villa rustica]]'' from the 1st century CE.]]\n\nRome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion, but to no avail \u2013 the Lusitanians kept conquering territory. The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy. They bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him. In 139 BC, Viriathus was assassinated and [[Tautalus]] became leader of the Lusitanians.\n\nRome installed a colonial regime. The complete Romanization of Lusitania only took place in the [[Visigothic]] era.\n\nIn 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as [[Gallaecia]], with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's [[Braga]].\nThere are still many ruins of castros ([[hill forts]]) throughout modern Portugal and remains of the [[Castro culture]].\nSome urban remains are quite large, like [[Con\u00edmbriga]] and [[Mir\u00f3briga|Mirobriga]]. The former, beyond being one of the largest [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a [[Monuments of Portugal|National Monument]]. Con\u00edmbriga lies {{convert|16|km|abbr=off}} from [[Coimbra]], which in turn was the ancient ''[[Aeminium]]''. The site also has a museum that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations.\n\nSeveral works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres and laymen's homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, some coined in Lusitanian land, as well as numerous pieces of ceramics, were also found.

The [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] was the Germanic post-Roman kingdom, established in the former Roman provinces of [[Gallaecia]]-[[Lusitania]]. 5th-century vestiges of [[Alans|Alan]] settlements were found in [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]] (from old Germanic ''Alan kerk'', ''temple of the Alans''), [[Coimbra]] and Lisbon.<ref>Milhazes, Jos\u00e9.

In 448 Rechila died, leaving the state in expansion to [[Rechiar]].\nAfter the defeat against the Visigoths, the Suebian kingdom was divided, with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously. Both reigned from 456 to 457, the year in which Maldras (457\u2013459) reunified the kingdom to finish being assassinated after a failed Roman-Visigothic conspiracy.\nAlthough the conspiracy did not achieve its true purposes, the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between two kings:\n[[Frumar]] (Frumario 459\u2013463) and [[Remismund]] (Remismundo, son of [[Maldras]]) (459\u2013469) who would re-reunify his father's kingdom in 463 and that he would be forced to adopt [[Arianism]] in 465 due to the Visigoth influence.\nBy the year 500, the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] had been installed in Iberia, it was based in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and advancing westwards. They became a threat to the Suebian rule.\nAfter the death of Remismund in 469 a dark period set in, where virtually all written texts and accounts disappear. This period lasted until 550. The only thing known about this period is that [[Theodemund]] (Teodemundo) most probably ruled the Suebians.\nThe dark period ended with the reign of Karriarico (550\u2013559) who reinstalled [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]] in 550. He was succeed by [[Theodemir (Suebian king)|Theodemar]] (559\u2013570) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga (561) was held.\n\n[[File:Ariamirogaliza.jpg|thumb|left|Illustrated depiction of the [[First Council of Braga]] of 561 CE]]\n\nThe councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory (paroeciam suevorum (Suebian parish) and the [[Christianization]] of the pagan population (''[[De correctione rusticorum]]'') under the auspices of [[Saint Martin of Braga]] (S\u00e3o Martinho de Braga).\n\nAfter the death of Teodomiro, [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] (570\u2013583) was his successor. During his reign, the 2nd Council of Braga (572) was held.\nThe Visigothic civil war began in 577. Miro intervened. Later in 583 he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville. During the return from this failed operation Miro died.\n\nIn the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take place. [[Eborico]] (Eurico, 583\u2013584) was dethroned by [[Andeca]] (Audeca 584\u2013585), who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion led by Leovigildo. The Visigothic invasion, completed in 585, turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth province of the Gothic kingdom.\n[[Leovigild]] was crowned King of Gallaecia, Hispania and [[Gallia Narbonensis]].\n[[File:Cvp-00791-109v.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi King]] [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] and St. [[Martin of Braga]]; c. 1145]]\n\nFor the next 300 years and by the year 700, the entire Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Visigoths.

Both 'governors' [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] and [[Wittiza]] (Vitiza) acted as doge (they would later become kings in Toledo).  These two became known as the 'vitizians', who headquartered in the northwest and called on the Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in 711.\nKing [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing this invasion, thus becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia.\nFrom the various Germanic groups who settled in Western Iberia, the [[Suebi]] left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and western fringes of Asturias.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fim do Imp\u00e9rio Romano e Chegada dos Suevos|url=http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|website=notapositiva.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223112452/http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|archive-date=23 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Suevos|url=http://www.infoescola.com/povos-germanicos/suevos/|website=infoescola.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vest\u00edgios da presen\u00e7a sueva no noroeste da pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica: na etnologia, na arqueologia e na l\u00edngua|url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0807-89672013000200016|website=scielo.mec.pt|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref>\nAccording to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal.\nBracara Augusta, the modern city of [[Braga]] and former capital of [[Gallaecia]], became the capital of the Suebi.

This rule lasted from some decades in the North to five centuries in the South.\n\nAfter defeating the [[Visigoths]] in only a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of [[Damascus]], which stretched from the [[Indus]] river in the Indian sub-continent up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]] with the establishment of the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]]. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called [[Taifa]] kingdoms.\n\n[[File:Portugal DSC04496 - MERTOLA (34025572830).jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi]] outside the [[Castle of M\u00e9rtola]], in the [[Alentejo]]]]\n\nThe governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves [[Emir]] of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north.

One of the first cities Vimara Peres founded at this time is Vimaranes, known today as [[Guimar\u00e3es]] \u2013 the \"birthplace of the Portuguese nation\" or the \"cradle city\" (Cidade Ber\u00e7o in Portuguese).<ref name=\"QuidNovi\"/>\n\nAfter annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] knighted V\u00edmara Peres, in 868, as the First Count of Portus Cale (Portugal). The region became known as ''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', and simultaneously ''Portug\u00e1lia'' \u2013 the [[County of Portugal]].<ref name=\"QuidNovi\"/>\n\nLater the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of Christian Kingdoms in Northern Iberia due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the king's offspring. With the forced abdication of [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III \"the Great\" of Asturias]] by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 under the crown of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]].\n\nIn 1093, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n]] bestowed the county to [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] and married him to his daughter, [[Teresa of Le\u00f3n, Countess of Portugal|Teresa of Le\u00f3n]], for his role in reconquering the land from Moors.

This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal, as a fief of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, was transformed into the independent [[Kingdom of Portugal]].\n\nAfonso then established the first of the [[Portuguese Cortes]] at [[Lamego]], where he was crowned by the Archbishop of Braga, though the validity of the Cortes of Lamego has been disputed and called a myth created during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]].

Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], pushed southward to drive out the Moors. At this time, Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]] and complete expulsion of the last Moorish settlements on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present-day borders, with minor exceptions.\n\nIn one of these situations of conflict with the [[kingdom of Castile]], [[Dinis I of Portugal]] signed with the king [[Fernando IV of Castile]] (who was represented, when a minor, by his mother the queen [[Maria de Molina]]) the [[Treaty of Alca\u00f1ices (1297)]], which stipulated that Portugal abolished agreed treaties against the kingdom of Castile for supporting the infant [[Juan de Castilla]].

The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Mary Anne of Austria|Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria]], was fond of Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]], however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son, Joseph I of Portugal, was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the [[Queen Mother]]'s approval, he appointed Melo as [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs.\n\nAs the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo was made Prime Minister. Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from his time as an Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India, reorganized the army and the navy, restructured the [[University of Coimbra]], and ended discrimination against different [[Christianity|Christian]] sects in Portugal.\n\nSebasti\u00e3o de Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Ruinas da Pra\u00e7a da Patriarcal ap\u00f3s o Terramoto de 1755 - Jacques Philippe Le Bas, 1757.png  |width1= 1012 |height1= 716\n| image3 = Ruinas da Igreja de S.

We bury the dead and take care of the living.\"\n\nDespite the calamity and huge [[death toll]], Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt. The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes. Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline City Centre still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of [[seismology]] by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] gave his Prime Minister even more power, and Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo became a powerful, progressive dictator. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]] and the [[Dukes of Aveiro|Duke of Aveiro]] were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo prosecuted every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy. Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in 1759.\n\nIn 1762, [[Spanish\u2013Portuguese War, 1761\u20131763|Spain invaded Portuguese territory]] as part of the [[Seven Years' War]], but by 1763 the ''status quo'' between Spain and Portugal before the war had been restored.\n\nFollowing the T\u00e1vora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Made \"Marquis of Pombal\" in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1779.\n\nThe new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], disliked the Marquis because of the power he amassed, and never forgave him for the ruthlessness with which he dispatched the T\u00e1vora family, and upon her accession to the throne, she withdrew all his political offices. The Marquis of Pombal died on his estate at [[Pombal, Portugal|Pombal]] in 1782.\n\nHowever, historians also argue that Pombal's \"enlightenment,\" while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.<ref>Kenneth Maxwell, ''Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 83, 91\u2013108, 160\u201362.</ref>\n\n=== Napoleonic era ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1777\u20131834)|United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | footer =\n | image1 = Embarque da Fam\u00edlia Real para o Brasil - Nicolas-Louis-Albert Delerive, attrib.

This decline was hastened by the [[independence of Brazil]], the country's largest colonial possession.\n\nIn the autumn of 1807, [[Napoleon]] moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal. From 1807 to 1811, British-Portuguese forces would successfully fight against the French invasion of Portugal in the [[Peninsular War]], during which the royal family and the Portuguese [[nobility]], including Maria I, relocated to the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese territory of Brazil]], at that time a colony of the [[Portuguese Empire]], in South America. This episode is known as the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]].\n\nIn 1807, as Napoleon's army closed in on Lisbon, [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal]], the [[Prince Regent]], transferred his court to Brazil and established [[Rio de Janeiro]] as the capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it, forming a pluricontinental state, the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]].\n\n[[File:Portuguese Constitution of 1826.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The frontispiece of the 1826 Portuguese Constitution featuring King-Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro IV]] and his daughter Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]]]\nAs a result of the change in its status and the arrival of the Portuguese royal family, Brazilian administrative, civic, [[Economic history of Brazil#The economy at independence, 1822|economical]], military, [[Education in Brazil#History|educational]], and [[Brazilian science and technology#History|scientific]] apparatus were expanded and highly modernized. Portuguese and their allied British troops fought against the [[French Invasion of Portugal]] and by 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that Jo\u00e3o VI would have been able to return safely to Lisbon. However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]], which started in [[Porto]], demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.\n\nThus he returned to Portugal but left his son [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] in charge of Brazil. When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] from Portugal. [[Cisplatina]] (today's sovereign state of Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.\n\nBrazilian independence was recognized in 1825, whereby Emperor Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of ''Emperor of Brazil''. John VI's death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession. Though Pedro was his heir, and reigned briefly as Pedro IV, his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations. Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] (Mary II). However, Pedro's brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Infante Miguel]], claimed the throne in protest. After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed, Miguel seized power as King Miguel I, in 1828. In order to defend his daughter's rights to the throne, Pedro launched the [[Portuguese Civil War|Liberal Wars]] to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The war ended in 1834, with Miguel's defeat, the promulgation of a constitution, and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II.\n\n=== Constitutional monarchy ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1834\u20131910)}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = O Regic\u00eddio por Haenen (2).jpg\n | image2 = Aclama\u00e7\u00e3o de Dom Manuel II.jpg\n | image3 = Proclama\u00e7\u00e3o Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa.jpg\n | footer = Top to bottom: The [[Lisbon Regicide]] (1908), [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]]'s acclamation as King (1908) and the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Proclamation of the Republic]] (1910)\n }}\nQueen Maria II (Mary II) and King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II]]'s son, King [[Pedro V]] (Peter V) modernized the country during his short reign (1853\u20131861). Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the [[cholera]] outbreak of 1853\u20131856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro's reign was short, as he died of cholera in 1861, after a series of deaths in the royal family, including his two brothers [[Infante Fernando of Portugal|Infante Fernando]] and [[Infante Jo\u00e3o, Duke of Beja]], and his wife, [[Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]]. Pedro not having children, his brother, [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal]] (Louis I) ascended the throne and continued his modernization.\n\nAt the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia. [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]], [[Bissau]], [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]], [[Porto Amboim]] and the [[Island of Mozambique]] were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.\n\nWith the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Conference of Berlin]] of 1884, Portuguese territories in Africa had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Portuguese towns and cities in Africa like [[Nova Lisboa]], [[Lubango|S\u00e1 da Bandeira]], [[Kuito|Silva Porto]], [[Malanje]], [[Tete]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Vila Pery]] and [[Vila Cabral]] were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Namibe|Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes]], [[Lobito]], [[Jo\u00e3o Belo]], [[Nacala]] and [[Porto Am\u00e9lia]] were also founded. Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks as the [[Benguela railway]] in Angola, and the [[Beira railway]] in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.\n\nOther episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the [[1890 British Ultimatum]]. This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its \"[[Pink Map]]\", which clashed with British aspirations to create a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]].\n\nThe Portuguese territories in Africa were [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. The tiny fortress of [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]] on the coast of [[Dahomey]], was also under Portuguese rule. In addition, Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]] and [[Portuguese Macau]].\n\nOn February 1, 1908, King Dom [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his [[heir apparent]] and his eldest son, [[Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Prince Royal Dom Lu\u00eds Filipe]], [[Duke of Braganza]], [[Lisbon Regicide|were assassinated in Lisbon]] in the [[Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]] by two Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries, [[Alfredo Lu\u00eds da Costa]] and [[Manuel Bu\u00ed\u00e7a]]. Under his rule, Portugal had been declared [[bankrupt]]&nbsp;twice \u2013 first on June 14, 1892, and then again on May 10, 1902&nbsp;\u2013 causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, angry protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. His second and youngest son, [[Manuel II of Portugal]], became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the [[5 October 1910 revolution|5 October 1910 Portuguese republican revolution]], which abolished the monarchy and installed a [[republic]]an government in Portugal, causing him and his royal family to flee into [[exile]] in [[London]], [[England]].\n\n=== First Republic and Estado Novo ===\n[[File:Bernardino Machado, Te\u00f3filo Braga, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida e Afonso Costa, ap\u00f3s uma sess\u00e3o solene do Parlamento em homenagem aos mortos da revolu\u00e7\u00e3o republicana, 1911.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Left to right: President [[Bernardino Machado]], President [[Te\u00f3filo Braga]], President [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida]], and Prime Minister [[Afonso Costa]]; 1911]]\n{{Main|Portuguese First Republic|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}\nThe new republic had many problems. Portugal had 45 different governments in just 15 years. During [[World War I|World War 1]] (1914\u20131918), Portugal helped the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] fight the [[Central Powers]]. But the war hurt its weak economy. Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[Portuguese First Republic]]. These conditions would lead to the failed [[Monarchy of the North]], [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]], and the creation of the National Dictatorship (''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'').\nThis in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] under [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933.\n\nPortugal remained neutral in [[World War II]].\nFrom the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], as the largest and richest overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's status as a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] nation and not as a colonial empire.\n\nAfter India attained independence in 1947, pro-Indian residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organisations, separated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954.<ref name =lele>P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,</ref> In 1961, [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire.\n[[File:Antonio Salazar-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1968, within the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.]]\nAccording to the census of 1921 S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty.\n\nAnother forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]].\n\nThe [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations resulted in the defeat]] and surrender of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in Portugal's National Assembly until the military coup of 1974.\n\nAlso in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974).\n\nThroughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. However, the authoritarian and conservative [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, first installed and governed by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and from 1968 onwards led by [[Marcelo Caetano]], tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |title=Portugal N\u00e3o \u00c9 Um Pa\u00eds Pequeno |publisher=Purl.pt |accessdate=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141025060609/http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |archivedate=25 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Carnation Revolution and European integration ===\n{{Main|Carnation Revolution|Portuguese transition to democracy}}\n[[File:Portuguese colonial war blank map.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Portuguese Africa]] before independence in 1975]]\nThe Portuguese government and army resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in Lisbon, known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso]]''). This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]).<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], ''[[The Economist]]'', 16 August 1975</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 7 July 1975</ref>\n\nOver one million [[White African#Portuguese in Africa|Portuguese refugees]] fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. [[M\u00e1rio Soares]] and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] were charged with organising the independence of Portugal's overseas territories. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|its first democratic elections]] in 50 years.\n\nPortugal continued to be governed by a [[Junta de Salva\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional]] until the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]]. It was won by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]] (PS) and M\u00e1rio Soares, its leader, became Prime Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July. M\u00e1rio Soares would be Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985. In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution, during the last decade of the previous regime. He initiated the process of accession to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) by starting accession negotiations as early as 1977.\n[[File:Portugese minister Soares (voorzitter Socialistische Partij) op Schiphol aangeko, Bestanddeelnr 927-7110.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[M\u00e1rio Soares]] became Portugal's first democratically elected Prime-Minister in 1976.]]\nPortugal bounced between [[socialism]] and adherence to the [[neoliberal]] model. [[Land reform]] and [[nationalization]]s were enforced; the [[Portuguese Constitution]] (approved in 1976) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution was a document with numerous references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a [[socialist economy]]. Portugal's economic situation after its transition to democracy, obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilization programs in 1977\u201378 and 1983\u201385.\n\nIn 1986, Portugal joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that later became the European Union (EU). In the following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU [[structural and cohesion funds]] and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets.\n\nPortugal's last overseas and Asian colonial territory, [[Macau]], was peacefully handed over to the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] on December 20, 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of [[East Timor]] (Asia) was formally recognized by Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation Revolution, but interrupted by an [[Indonesia]]n armed invasion and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]].\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, when Portugal held the presidency for the [[European Council]].]]\nOn 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states. In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon. In 1996, [[Jorge Sampaio]] became president. He won [[2001 Portuguese presidential election|re-election]] in January 2001. [[Expo '98]] took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and the [[eurozone]]. On July 5, 2004, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]], then [[Prime Minister of Portugal]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]], the most powerful office in the European Union. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action. The [[Republic of Ireland]] was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. It was initially rejected by voters in 2008.\n\nEconomic disruption and an unsustainable growth in [[government debt]] during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (EFSM) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF), a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.\n\n== Geography ==\n<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: \"Geography of Portugal\" and \"Protected areas of Portugal\", your work there will be very appreciated. -->\n{{Main|Geography of Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer =\n | image1 = Portugal topographic map-pt.png\n | caption1 = Topography and administration.\n }}\nThe territory of Portugal includes an area on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (referred to as ''the continent'' by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores.

Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss, pollution and drought. Up-welling along the west coast of Portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish; the Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world. [[Marine fish]] species are more common, and include thousands of species, such as the [[sardine]] (''Sardina pilchardus''), [[tuna]] and [[Atlantic mackerel]].

Elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[Closed list|closed]] [[party-list proportional representation]], deputies serve four-year terms of office, unless the President dissolves the Assembly and calls for new elections.\n\nCurrently the Government ([[Socialist Party (Portugal)|PS]]) and the parties supporting it through a [[Confidence and supply|confidence-and-supply agreement]] ([[Left Bloc|BE]], [[Portuguese Communist Party|PCP]], [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"|PEV]]) control parliament with the most seats.

The main laws include the Constitution (1976, as amended), the [[Portuguese Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code of Portugal]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended).\n\nThe supreme national courts are the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Portugal)|Supreme Court of Justice]] and the [[Constitutional Court of Portugal|Constitutional Court]]. The [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]], headed by the Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors.\n\nPortuguese laws were applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continue to be major influences for those countries.\n\nPortugal was the first country in the world to abolish [[life imprisonment]] (in 1884) and was one of the first countries to [[Capital punishment in Portugal|abolish the death penalty]]. Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years.\n\nPortugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001, the first country in the world to do so. Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including [[cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[LSD]]. While possession is legal, trafficking and possession of more than \"10 days worth of personal use\" are still punishable by jail time and fines. People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with the number of [[HIV]] infection cases, which had dropped 50 percent by 2009. Drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined, however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group.<ref>Brian Vastag [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization 5 Years After: Portugal's Drug Decriminalization Policy Shows Positive Results].

New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal's distribution system is also now a two-way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like rooftop solar panels. The government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Portugal|}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = Viana_do_Castelo,_Portugal_(4922364383).jpg\n | image2 = Fado1 - Fadistas a los Jeronimos.JPG\n | footer = Young people in traditional attire from [[Minho (province)|Minho]] (top) and [[Fado|fadistas]] playing at [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] (bottom)\n }}\nThe Statistics Portugal ({{lang-pt|INE \u2013 [[Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]]}}) estimates that, according to the 2011 census, the population was 10,562,178 (of which 52% was female, 48% was male). In 2018 and according to more up-to-date figures, the population decreased to 10,276,617.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> This population has been relatively homogeneous for most of its history: a single religion (Roman Catholicism) and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and national unity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html |title=Portugal |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>\nMinorities of ''Crist\u00e3os Novos'' (New Christians) nevertheless, stayed in Portugal after converting to Catholicism. A very small number of former Jews may have continued to observe rabbinic Judaism in secret over many generations, namely the [[History of the Jews in Belmonte|Jews of Belmonte]], a town in the interior; where people now observe the [[Jewish]] faith openly. Some famous Portuguese New Christians were the mathematician [[Pedro Nunes]] and the physician and naturalist [[Garcia de Orta]]. Another interesting demographic feature relates to the Scandinavian expansion towards the West and strong activity in Northern Portugal where some coastline communities kept [[Scandinavia]]n ancestry in [[Aveiro District|Aveiro]], [[Porto District|Porto]] and [[Braga District|Braga]] regions.\n\nThe most important demographic influence in the modern Portuguese seems to be the oldest one; current interpretation of [[Y-chromosome]] and [[mtDNA]] data suggests that the Portuguese have their origin in [[Paleolithic]] peoples that began arriving to the European continent around 45,000 years ago. All subsequent migrations did leave an impact, genetically and culturally, but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic. Genetic studies show Portuguese populations not to be significantly different from other European populations.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmc=1852743 | year=2007 | last1=Bauchet | first1=M | last2=McEvoy | first2=B | last3=Pearson | first3=LN | last4=Quillen | first4=EE | last5=Sarkisian | first5=T | last6=Hovhannesyan | first6=K | last7=Deka | first7=R | last8=Bradley | first8=DG | last9=Shriver | first9=MD | title=Measuring European Population Stratification with Microarray Genotype Data | volume=80 | issue=5 | pages=948\u2013956 | journal=American Journal of Human Genetics | doi=10.1086/513477 | pmid=17436249 }}</ref> Portuguese people have a preponderancy of genetics (Iron Age Period)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eupedia.com/europe/autosomal_maps_dodecad.shtml|title=Eupedia Autosomal Maps|last=|first=|date=|website=Eupedia.com|access-date=}}</ref> which belong to R1b haplogroup family along with [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]], [[Alpine states|Alpine]] and [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] genetical markers.

Galicia is a consultative observer of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]].\n\nThe Portuguese language is derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] spoken by the [[Romanization (cultural)|romanized]] [[pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula]] around 2000 years ago \u2013 particularly the [[Celts]],<ref> https://www.academia.edu/10819665/Origem_e_significado_dos_nomes_de_Portugal_e_da_Galiza </ref> [[Conii]],<ref> https://www.academia.edu/3405973/Algumas_observa\u00e7\u00f5es_sobre_a_escrita_do_Sudoeste </ref> [[Lusitanians]]<ref> https://www.academia.edu/31989410/Documentos_danca_portuguesa </ref> and [[Turduli]].<ref> https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=LXJQAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA117&lpg=RA1-PA117&dq=turdulos+origem+academia&source=bl&ots=0RaAScg92U&sig=ACfU3U3DxNJB-caxjSxe7mlw_gu6OsM12w&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj_kojpmOPoAhVrUxUIHcanDB4Q6AEwAXoECBIQLA#v=onepage&q=turdulos%20origem%20academia&f=false </ref>\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the language spread worldwide as Portugal established a colonial and commercial empire between 1415 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portugueselanguage.net/portuguese/history.asp|title=History of the Portuguese|website=Portugueselanguage.net|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\nPortuguese is spoken as a native language in five different continents, with Brazil accounting for the largest number of native Portuguese speakers of any country.\nIn 2013 the Portuguese language is the official language spoken in Brazil, Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial Guinea, and [[East Timor]]. These countries, plus [[Macau]] Special Administrative Region (People's Republic of China) where Portuguese is co-official with [[Cantonese]], make up the [[Lusosphere]], a term derived from the ancient [[Roman province]] of \"[[Lusitania]]\", which currently matches the Portuguese territory south of the [[Douro]] river.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0064:id=lusitania-geo|title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854), Labanae Aquae\u00b4NIA|website=Tufts.edu|accessdate=14 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Mirandese language|Mirandese]] is also recognized as a co-official regional language in some municipalities of North-Eastern Portugal.

In addition to being a destination for [[international student]]s, Portugal is also among the top places of origin for international students.

The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]]<ref> https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-coimbra </ref> was first established in Lisbon before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Historically, within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the [[Americas]] (the ''[[Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortifica\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenho]]'' of [[Rio de Janeiro]]) in 1792, as well as the oldest medical college in Asia (the ''[[Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica de Goa|Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica]]'' of [[Goa]]) in 1842. Presently, the largest university in Portugal is the [[University of Lisbon]].\n\nThe [[Bologna process]] has been adopted by Portuguese universities and poly-technical institutes in 2006. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of ''[[numerus clausus]]'' is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), [[international students]], foreign students from the [[Lusosphere]], degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions ([[Transfer admissions in the United States|academic transfer]]), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.\n\nMost student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students (many as part-time students or in evening classes) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).\n\nPortugal has entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other US institutions]] to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.\n\n=== Health ===\n{{Main|Health in Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align    = right\n | image1 = Miragaia-Rua do Prof. Vicente Jose de Carvalho-Hospital Sto.

The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 25% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 10% by private insurance schemes and another 7% by mutual funds.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS. Five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives, developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, however, the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care.\n\nThe SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.\n[[File:FCM-UNL.JPG|thumb|left|The Medical Department of the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]]]]\nSimilar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from [[noncommunicable diseases]]. Mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]] (CVD) is higher than in the [[eurozone]], but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with [[cerebrovascular disease]] being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%). Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer are more frequent.\nPortugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.\n\nPortugal's [[infant mortality rate]] is around 2 deaths per 1000 newborns, with 2.4 deaths per 1000 live births.\n\nPeople are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health, and their use of health care services. Yet their perceptions of their health, can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations. Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at household level, complement other data on health status and the use of services.\n\nOnly one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |title=Highlights on health in Portugal 2004 |accessdate=25 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201122536/http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |archivedate=1 December 2009 }}.

Two other popular fish recipes are grilled [[sardines]] and [[caldeirada]], a tomato-based [[stew]] that can be made from several types of fish with a mix of onion, garlic, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, parsley or [[coriander]]. Typical Portuguese meat recipes made out of beef, pork, lamb, goat or chicken include ''[[cozido \u00e0 portuguesa]]'', ''[[feijoada]]'', ''[[frango de churrasco]]'', ''leit\u00e3o'' (roast [[suckling pig]]), ''[[chanfana]]'' and ''[[carne de porco \u00e0 alentejana]]''. A very popular northern dish is [[dobrada]], a tripe with white beans and carrots stew, often served with steamed white rice.  [[Piri-piri]] chicken is a spicy charcoal chicken dish served with rice and vegetables, a favourite throughout Portugal, but most common in the [[Algarve]] region.\n[[File: MargaretCafe PasteisDeNata.JPG|thumb|right|Pasteis de Nata in [[Lisboa]]]]\nTypical fast food dishes include the [[Francesinha]] (Frenchie) from Porto, \"Tripas \u00e0 moda do Porto\" which is also a traditional plate from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork) or ''prego'' (grilled beef) [[sandwich]]es, which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in the many [[medieval]] Catholic monasteries spread widely across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly almonds, [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]], flour, eggs and some liquor), managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries, of which [[past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m]] (or ''past\u00e9is de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and ''[[ovos moles]]'' from Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a culture of good food, and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and typical small ''tasquinhas''.\n\nPortuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the times of the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today, the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do D\u00e3o]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]], and the [[Moscatel]] from [[Set\u00fabal]] and [[Favaios]].

The traditional one is the Portuguese folk music which has deep roots in local customs having as instruments [[bagpipes]] (''[[gaita]]'') , drums, flutes, tambourines, accordions and ukuleles (''[[cavaquinho]]''). Within Portuguese folk music is the renowned genre of [[Fado]], a melancholic urban music originated in [[Lisbon]] in the 19th century, probably inside bohemian environments, usually associated with the [[Portuguese guitar]] and ''saudade'', or longing. [[Coimbra fado]], a unique type of \"[[troubadour]] serenading\" fado, is also noteworthy.

Out of the summer season, Portugal has a large number of festivals, designed more to an urban audience, like Flowfest or Hip Hop Porto. Furthermore, one of the largest international [[Goa trance]] festivals takes place in central Portugal every two years, the Boom Festival, that is also the only festival in Portugal to win international awards: European Festival Award 2010 \u2013 Green'n'Clean Festival of the Year and the Greener Festival Award Outstanding 2008 and 2010.
