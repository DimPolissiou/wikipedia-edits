It is the largest island of the country [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] island chain. It is located in the [[Caribbean Sea]], between [[Saint Lucia]] and [[Grenada]]. It is composed of partially submerged volcanic mountains. Its largest volcano and the country's highest peak, [[Soufri\u00e8re (volcano)|La Soufri\u00e8re]], is active, having last erupted in 1979.<ref>{{cite book| first= Jan| last= Rogozinski| year= 1999| title= A Brief History of the Caribbean| edition= Revised| publisher= Facts on File,  Inc.| location= New York| pages= [https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofca00rogo_0/page/358 358\u2013359]| isbn= 0-8160-3811-2| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofca00rogo_0/page/358}}</ref>\n\nThere were major territory wars between the indigenous population of the [[Black Caribs]], also called the [[garifuna]], the [[United Kingdom]] in the 18th century, before the island was ceded to the British in 1763 and again in 1783. [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] gained independence from the British on October 27, 1979 and became part of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]] thereafter. Approximately 130,000 people currently live on the island, and the population saw significant migration to the [[United Kingdom]] in the early 1900s and between the 1940s & 1980s. There has also been significant migration to [[Canada]] and other larger neighbouring [[Anglo-Caribbean]] islands. The main island consists of [[Kingstown]] the capital, with the rest of the island divided into the five main coastal strip towns of [[Layou]], [[Barrouallie]], [[Chateaubelair]], [[Georgetown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Georgetown]], and [[Calliaqua]].\n\n==People==\n[[File:Kingstown Saint Vincent.jpg|thumb|Kingstown, Saint Vincent]]\nThe people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are formally called Vincentians, colloquially they are known as ''Vincies'' or Vincys. The majority of the island's population is of Afro-Vincentian descent. However, a sizable portion of the population consists of black charibe descendants, white descendants of English colonists, Portuguese descendants of indentured servants and a significant number of Indo-Vincentians, descendants of [[indentured workers]] with [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian heritage]]. There is also a sizable mixed-race minority (19%).\n\nIn 2012, the population of the island was approximately 130,000. The main religions are [[Anglican]] (47%), [[Methodist]] (10%), [[Roman Catholic]] (13%), and other [[Protestant]] denominations such as [[Seventh-day Adventist|Seventh-day Adventism]], [[Spiritual Baptist|Spiritual baptism]] and [[Hinduism]].\n\nAdult [[literacy]] was 88.1% in 2004. Infant mortality in 2006 was 17 per 1,000 live births and life expectancy for men stood at 69 years, 74 years for women. The active workforce in 2006 was 57,695 and unemployment in 2004 was 12%.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines}}\nBefore 1498, the island was called ''Hairouna'' by its indigenous inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indigenousreview.blogspot.com.au/#stash.9WFLBXgH.dpuf|title=Review of the Indigenous Caribbean|author=|date=|website=indigenousreview.blogspot.com.au|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> Columbus named the island Saint Vincent, since it is said to have been discovered on 22 January, the feast day of the patron saint of Lisbon and Valencia, [[Vincent of Saragossa]].\n\nColumbus and the Spanish [[conquistadors]] embarked on slaving expeditions in and around St. Vincent following royal sanction in 1511, driving the inhabitants to the rugged interior, but the Spanish were not able to settle the island.<ref>Rogozinski, January  2000. ''A Brief History of the Caribbean: From the Arawak to the Present''. Plume, New York, New York.</ref> \nIn the 1500s Columbus and the conquistadors noted there was a significantly large African population living amongst the native population, whom they assumed had come from  shipwrecked slave ships or escaped from [[St. Lucia]] or [[Grenada]] to seek refuge in St. Vincent. They were called \"Black Caribs,\" but are now known as ''[[Garifuna people|Garifuna]]''.\n\nThe large population aggressively prevented [[Europe]]an settlement on St. Vincent until the 18th century.\n\n===French colony===\nThe first Europeans to occupy St. Vincent were the French. However, following a series of wars and peace treaties, these islands were eventually ceded to the British. While the English were the first to lay claim to St. Vincent in 1627, the French, centered on the island of [[Martinique]], became the first Europeans to invade the island, establishing their first colony at [[Barrouallie]] on the Leeward side of St. Vincent in 1719.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://svgancestry.com/index.php/st-vincent-timeline/|title=Attention * St. Vincent Genealogy Resources|author=|date=|website=St. Vincent Genealogy Resources|access-date=26 March 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321165131/http://svgancestry.com/index.php/st-vincent-timeline|archive-date=21 March 2012|df=}}</ref> African slaves were made to cultivate coffee, tobacco, indigo, corn, and sugar on plantations operated by the French colonizers.

Upon taking control of the island in 1763, the British laid the foundations of [[Fort Charlotte, Saint Vincent|Fort Charlotte]] which was completed in 1806. The island was [[French capture of Saint Vincent|reverted to French rule in 1779]], then regained by the British under the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)]]. Between 1793 and 1796, the Black Caribs, led by their chief, [[Joseph Chatoyer]], fought a series of battles against the British. The combat ultimately ended in a treaty, after which 5,000 Garifuna were exiled to the smaller island of [[Baliceaux]] off the coast of [[Bequia]]. Conflict between the British and the indigenous peoples continued until 1796, when General [[Ralph Abercromby]] [[Second Carib War|ended a revolt]] fomented by the radical [[Victor Hugues]]. The British deported more than 5,000 Black Caribs to [[Roat\u00e1n]], an island off the coast of [[Honduras]].\n\nLike the French before them, the British also made African slaves work plantations of sugar, coffee, indigo, tobacco, cotton and cocoa until full emancipation in 1838. The economy then went into a period of decline, with many landowners abandoning their estates and leaving the land to be cultivated by liberated slaves. Life was made even harder following two eruptions of the [[La Soufriere (volcano)|La Soufriere]] volcano in 1812 and 1902 when much of the island was destroyed and many people were killed. The volcano erupted once more in 1979, with no fatalities. In the same year, St Vincent & The Grenadines gained full independence from Britain, though it remains a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\n===British colony===\n[[File:A Negro Festival drawn from Nature in the Island of St Vincent.JPG|thumb|upright|Engraving 'after Agostino Brunias' (ca 1801) entitled ''A Negro Festival drawn from Nature in the Island of St Vincent''. [[National Maritime Museum]], Greenwich]]\n\nFrom 1763 until independence, St. Vincent passed through various stages of colonial status under the British. A representative assembly was authorized in 1776. The British abolished slavery in 1834. The resulting labour shortages on the plantations attracted [[Portugal|Portuguese]] immigrants in the 1840s and [[Indo-Caribbean|East Indians]] in the 1860s as laborers. Conditions remained harsh for both former slaves and immigrant agricultural workers, as depressed world sugar prices kept the economy stagnant until the turn of the 20th century. The [[Opobo]] king [[Jaja of Opobo|Jaja]] was exiled to St. Vincent after his 1887 arrest by the British for shipping cargoes of [[palm oil]] directly to [[Liverpool]] without the intermediation of the [[National African Company]].\n\nA [[Crown Colony]] government was installed in 1877, a Legislative Council created in 1925, and universal adult [[suffrage]] granted in 1951. During this period, the British made several unsuccessful attempts to affiliate St. Vincent with other [[Windward Islands]] in order to govern the region through a unified administration. The most notable was the [[West Indies Federation]], which collapsed in 1962.\n\n==Self-rule and independence==\nSt. Vincent was granted [[Associated state|associate statehood status]] by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] on 27 October 1969, giving it complete control over its internal affairs. Following a referendum in 1979, St. Vincent and the Grenadines became the last of the Windward Islands to gain independence. It celebrates independence every year on 27 October.\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe island of Saint Vincent is {{convert|29|km|mi}} long and {{convert|18|km|mi}} wide and is located {{convert|160|km|mi}} west of Barbados.\n\nOn the island of Saint Vincent, there is a {{convert|1234|m|ft|adj=on}} active volcano, [[La Soufri\u00e8re (volcano)|La Soufriere]], that erupted violently in 1812 and 1902. The most recent eruption was on April 13, 1979, falling on [[Good Friday]].\n\nThe island is very mountainous and well-forested.\n\nSaint Vincent island belongs to the [[Lesser Antilles]] chain.\n\nThe island has a total surface area of {{convert|344|km2|sqmi}}, or about 88% of the total country area, 19 times that of the country's second largest island [[Bequia]]. The coastline measures about {{convert|84|km|mi}}.\n\nThe island's climate is tropical and humid, with an average of between {{convert|18|and|31|\u00b0C}} depending on the altitude.\n\nMore than 95% of the beaches on the mainland have black sand, while most of the beaches in the Grenadines have white sand.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}\n\nFor many years,{{when|date=April 2013}} the black sand was used in the building industry.

It is the largest island of the country [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] island chain. It is located in the [[Caribbean Sea]], between [[Saint Lucia]] and [[Grenada]]. It is composed of partially submerged volcanic mountains. Its largest volcano and the country's highest peak, [[Soufri\u00e8re (volcano)|La Soufri\u00e8re]], is active, having last erupted in 1979.<ref>{{cite book| first= Jan| last= Rogozinski| year= 1999| title= A Brief History of the Caribbean| edition= Revised| publisher= Facts on File,  Inc.| location= New York| pages= [https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofca00rogo_0/page/358 358\u2013359]| isbn= 0-8160-3811-2| url-access= registration| url= https://archive.org/details/briefhistoryofca00rogo_0/page/358}}</ref>\n\nThere were major territory wars between the indigenous population of the [[Black Caribs]], also called the [[garifuna]], the [[United Kingdom]] in the 18th century, before the island was ceded to the British in 1763 and again in 1783. [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] gained independence from the British on October 27, 1979 and became part of the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]] thereafter. Approximately 130,000 people currently live on the island, and the population saw significant migration to the [[United Kingdom]] in the early 1900s and between the 1940s & 1980s. There has also been significant migration to [[Canada]] and other larger neighbouring [[Anglo-Caribbean]] islands. The main island consists of [[Kingstown]] the capital, with the rest of the island divided into the five main coastal strip towns of [[Layou]], [[Barrouallie]], [[Chateaubelair]], [[Georgetown, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines|Georgetown]], and [[Calliaqua]].\n\n==People==\n[[File:Kingstown Saint Vincent.jpg|thumb|Kingstown, Saint Vincent]]\nThe people of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are formally called Vincentians, colloquially they are known as ''Vincies'' or Vincys. The majority of the island's population is of Afro-Vincentian descent. However, a sizable portion of the population consists of black charibe descendants, white descendants of English colonists, Portuguese descendants of indentured servants and a significant number of Indo-Vincentians, descendants of [[indentured workers]] with [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian heritage]]. There is also a sizable mixed-race minority (19%).\n\nIn 2012, the population of the island was approximately 130,000. The main religions are [[Anglican]] (47%), [[Methodist]] (10%), [[Roman Catholic]] (13%), and other [[Protestant]] denominations such as [[Seventh-day Adventist|Seventh-day Adventism]], [[Spiritual Baptist|Spiritual baptism]] and [[Hinduism]].\n\nAdult [[literacy]] was 88.1% in 2004. Infant mortality in 2006 was 17 per 1,000 live births and life expectancy for men stood at 69 years, 74 years for women. The active workforce in 2006 was 57,695 and unemployment in 2004 was 12%.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines}}\nBefore 1498, the island was called ''Hairouna'' by its indigenous inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indigenousreview.blogspot.com.au/#stash.9WFLBXgH.dpuf|title=Review of the Indigenous Caribbean|author=|date=|website=indigenousreview.blogspot.com.au|accessdate=26 March 2018}}</ref> Columbus named the island Saint Vincent, since it is said to have been discovered on 22 January, the feast day of the patron saint of Lisbon and Valencia, [[Vincent of Saragossa]].\n\nColumbus and the Spanish [[conquistadors]] embarked on slaving expeditions in and around St. Vincent following royal sanction in 1511, driving the inhabitants to the rugged interior, but the Spanish were not able to settle the island.<ref>Rogozinski, January  2000. ''A Brief History of the Caribbean: From the Arawak to the Present''. Plume, New York, New York.</ref> \nIn the 1500s Columbus and the conquistadors noted there was a significantly large African population living amongst the native population, whom they assumed had come from  shipwrecked slave ships or escaped from [[St. Lucia]] or [[Grenada]] to seek refuge in St. Vincent. They were called \"Black Caribs,\" but are now known as ''[[Garifuna people|Garifuna]]''.\n\nThe large population aggressively prevented [[Europe]]an settlement on St. Vincent until the 18th century.\n\n===French colony===\nThe first Europeans to occupy St. Vincent were the French. However, following a series of wars and peace treaties, these islands were eventually ceded to the British. While the English were the first to lay claim to St. Vincent in 1627, the French, centered on the island of [[Martinique]], became the first Europeans to invade the island, establishing their first colony at [[Barrouallie]] on the Leeward side of St. Vincent in 1719.<ref>{{cite webtp://svgancestry.com/index.php/st-vincent-timeline/|title=Attention * St. Vincent Genealogy Resources|author=|date=|website=St. Vincent Genealogy Resources|access-date=26 March 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321165131/http://svgancestry.com/index.php/st-vincent-timeline|archive-date=21 March 2012|df=}}</ref> African slaves were made to cultivate coffee, tobacco, indigo, corn, and sugar on plantations operated by the French colonizers.

Upon taking control of the island in 1763, the British laid the foundations of [[Fort Charlotte, Saint Vincent|Fort Charlotte]] which was completed in 1806. The island was [[French capture of Saint Vincent|reverted to French rule in 1779]], then regained by the British under the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)]]. Between 1793 and 1796, the Black Caribs, led by their chief, [[Joseph Chatoyer]], fought a series of battles against the British. The combat ultimately ended in a treaty, after which 5,000 Garifuna were exiled to the smaller island of [[Baliceaux]] off the coast of [[Bequia]]. Conflict between the British and the indigenous peoples continued until 1796, when General [[Ralph Abercromby]] [[Second Carib War|ended a revolt]] fomented by the radical [[Victor Hugues]]. The British deported more than 5,000 Black Caribs to [[Roat\u00e1n]], an island off the coast of [[Honduras]].\n\nLike the French before them, the British also made African slaves work plantations of sugar, coffee, indigo, tobacco, cotton and cocoa until full emancipation in 1838. The economy then went into a period of decline, with many landowners abandoning their estates and leaving the land to be cultivated by liberated slaves. Life was made even harder following two eruptions of the [[La Soufriere (volcano)|La Soufriere]] volcano in 1812 and 1902 when much of the island was destroyed and many people were killed. The volcano erupted once more in 1979, with no fatalities. In the same year, St Vincent & The Grenadines gained full independence from Britain, though it remains a member of the Commonwealth of Nations.\n\n===British colony===\n[[File:A Negro Festival drawn from Nature in the Island of St Vincent.JPG|thumb|upright|Engraving 'after Agostino Brunias' (ca 1801) entitled ''A Negro Festival drawn from Nature in the Island of St Vincent''. [[National Maritime Museum]], Greenwich]]\n\nFrom 1763 until independence, St. Vincent passed through various stages of colonial status under the British. A representative assembly was authorized in 1776. The British abolished slavery in 1834. The resulting labour shortages on the plantations attracted [[Portugal|Portuguese]] immigrants in the 1840s and [[Indo-Caribbean|East Indians]] in the 1860s as laborers. Conditions remained harsh for both former slaves and immigrant agricultural workers, as depressed world sugar prices kept the economy stagnant until the turn of the 20th century. The [[Opobo]] king [[Jaja of Opobo|Jaja]] was exiled to St. Vincent after his 1887 arrest by the British for shipping cargoes of [[palm oil]] directly to [[Liverpool]] without the intermediation of the [[National African Company]].\n\nA [[Crown Colony]] government was installed in 1877, a Legislative Council created in 1925, and universal adult [[suffrage]] granted in 1951. During this period, the British made several unsuccessful attempts to affiliate St. Vincent with other [[Windward Islands]] in order to govern the region through a unified administration. The most notable was the [[West Indies Federation]], which collapsed in 1962.\n\n==Self-rule and independence==\nSt. Vincent was granted [[Associated state|associate statehood status]] by [[United Kingdom|Britain]] on 27 October 1969, giving it complete control over its internal affairs. Following a referendum in 1979, St. Vincent and the Grenadines became the last of the Windward Islands to gain independence. It celebrates independence every year on 27 October.\n\n==Geography==\n\nThe island of Saint Vincent is {{convert|29|km|mi}} long and {{convert|18|km|mi}} wide and is located {{convert|160|km|mi}} west of Barbados.\n\nOn the island of Saint Vincent, there is a {{convert|1234|m|ft|adj=on}} active volcano, [[La Soufri\u00e8re (volcano)|La Soufriere]], that erupted violently in 1812 and 1902.

The countywide tax was initiated to increase funding for the money-losing [[Natividad Medical Center]], a county-run hospital. Although the proponents for the sales tax increase spent almost 100 times as much as the opponents (approximately $500,000), the measure lost. Natividad Medical Center remained open, despite claims during the campaign that it would close, making record profits of nearly $13 million in the 2009-2010 financial year.<ref>Jim Johnson, \"Salinas' Natividad Medical Center post record profits,\"Monterey Herald, Aug. 5, 2010.</ref> Once a columnist for \"Libertarian Perspective,\" Samuels is one of the founders and the vice chair of the Seaside Taxpayers Association.\n\nIn 2008 he was elected chairman of the Project Area Committee (PAC), a citizens committee to advise the Seaside Redevelopment Agency and the city of Seaside over eminent domain issues.<ref>Laith Agha, \"Seaside revisits eminent domain,\" Monterey Herald, May 15, 2008.</ref> Samuels is the winner of the 2007 Karl Bray Memorial Award, presented by the Samuel Adams Society.<ref>Jack Dean, \"Lawrence K.
