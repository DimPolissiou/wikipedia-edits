Tile is a manufactured piece of hard-wearing material such as [[ceramic]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], metal, baked clay, or even [[glass]], generally used for covering roofs, floors, walls, or other objects such as tabletops.  Alternatively, tile can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as [[perlite]], [[wood]], and [[mineral wool]], typically used for wall and ceiling applications. In another sense, a tile is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see [[tile-based game]]). The word is derived from the [[French Language|French]] word ''tuile'', which is, in turn, from the [[Latin Language|Latin]] word ''tegula'', meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay.\n\nTiles are often used to form wall and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex or [[mosaic]]s.  Tiles are most often made of [[pottery|ceramic]], typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, [[concrete]] and other composite materials, and stone. Tiling stone is typically marble, onyx, granite or slate. Thinner tiles can be used on walls than on floors, which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts.\n\n== Decorative tile work and coloured brick ==\n[[File:Grande Maison de Blanc Fleurs.JPG|thumb|[[Art Nouveau]] tiles in [[Bruxelles]] ([[Belgium]])]]\n\nDecorative tilework or [[tile art]] should be distinguished from [[mosaic]], where forms are made of great numbers of tiny irregularly positioned [[tesserae]], each of a single color, usually of glass or sometimes ceramic or stone.\n\n== History ==\n{{globalize|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Ancient Middle East===\nThe earliest evidence of glazed brick is the discovery of glazed bricks in the [[Elamite language|Elamite]] Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC. Glazed and colored bricks were used to make low reliefs in Ancient [[Mesopotamia]], most famously the [[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] (ca. 575 BC), now partly reconstructed in [[Berlin]], with sections elsewhere. Mesopotamian craftsmen were imported for the palaces of the [[Persian Empire]] such as [[Persepolis]].\n\nThe use of sun-dried bricks or adobe was the main method of building in [[Mesopotamia]] where river mud was found in abundance along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]. Here the scarcity of stone may have been an incentive to develop the technology of making kiln-fired bricks to use as an alternative. To strengthen walls made from sun-dried bricks, fired bricks began to be used as an outer protective skin for more important buildings like temples, palaces, city walls and gates. Making fired bricks is an advanced pottery technique. Fired bricks are solid masses of [[clay]] heated in kilns to temperatures of between 950\u00b0 and 1,150\u00b0[[Celsius|C]], and a well-made fired brick is an extremely durable object. Like sun-dried bricks they were made in wooden molds but for bricks with relief decorations special molds had to be made.\n\n=== Ancient Indian subcontinent ===\nRooms with tiled floors made of clay decorated with geometric circular patterns have been discovered from the ancient remains of [[Kalibangan]], [[Kot Bala|Balakot]] and Ahladino<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.202140|quote=kalibangan tiles.|title=Indian History|year=1926|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259063237|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218&dq=balakot+tiles+indus+valley&source=bl&ots=jcjUAvvfQ1&sig=eBjMQ80bDuX8BiWjyb6_VdkPPEU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjY9MTI_PHcAhVJYo8KHWZ6A8IQ6AEwDnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=balakot%20tiles%20indus%20valley&f=false|title=The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives|last=McIntosh|first=Jane|date=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576079072|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTiling was used in the second century by the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] kings of ancient [[Sri Lanka]], using smoothed and polished stone laid on floors and in swimming pools.

First half of the 15th century, [[Shah-i-Zinda]]]]\nThe golden age of Persian tilework began during the [[Timurid Empire]]. In the [[moraq]] technique, single-color tiles were cut into small geometric pieces and assembled by pouring liquid plaster between them. After hardening, these panels were assembled on the walls of buildings. But the mosaic was not limited to flat areas. Tiles were used to cover both the interior and exterior surfaces of domes. Prominent Timurid examples of this technique include the [[Jame mosque of Yazd|Jame Mosque]] of [[Yazd]] (AD 1324\u20131365), [[Goharshad Mosque]] (AD 1418), the Madrassa of Khan in Shiraz (AD 1615), and the [[Molana Mosque]] (AD 1444).<ref name=\"HistoryOfIranianTile\" />\n\nOther important tile techniques of this time include [[girih tiles]], with their characteristic white girih, or straps.\n\n[[Mihrab]]s, being the focal points of mosques, were usually the places where most sophisticated tilework was placed. The 14th-century mihrab at Madrasa Imami in [[Isfahan]] is an outstanding example of aesthetic union between the [[Islamic calligraphy|Islamic calligrapher's art]] and abstract ornament. The [[Ogive#Architecture|pointed arch]], framing the mihrab's niche, bears an inscription in Kufic script used in 9th-century [[Qur'an]].<ref name=\"Gardner\">{{cite book\n| title  = Gardner's Art Through The Ages, A Global History\n| author = Fred S.

Its dome is a prime example of tile mosaic and its winter praying hall houses one of the finest ensembles of ''[[cuerda seca]]'' tiles in the world. A wide variety of tiles had to be manufactured in order to cover complex forms of the hall with consistent mosaic patterns. The result was a technological triumph as well as a dazzling display of abstract ornament.<ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\nDuring the [[Safavid Empire|Safavid period]], mosaic ornaments were often replaced by a ''haft rang'' (seven colors) technique. Pictures were painted on plain rectangle tiles, glazed and fired afterwards. Besides economic reasons, the seven colors method gave more freedom to artists and was less time-consuming. It was popular until the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar period]], when the palette of colors was extended by yellow and orange.<ref name=\"HistoryOfIranianTile\" /> The seven colors of Haft Rang tiles were usually [[black]], [[white]], [[ultramarine]], [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[red]], [[yellow]] and [[Fawn (colour)|fawn]].\n\n[[File:001117 15-44-2002-To-grupper-rosa-Qajar-Fliser2.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Two panels of [[earthenware]] tiles painted with [[polychrome]] [[Ceramic glaze|glazes]] over a white glaze. (Iran 19thC)]]\nThe [[Persianate]] tradition continued and spread to much of the Islamic world, notably the [[\u0130znik pottery]] of [[Turkey]] under the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Palaces, public buildings, [[mosque]]s and [[t\u00fcrbe]] mausoleums were heavily decorated with large brightly colored patterns, typically with floral motifs, and [[frieze]]s of astonishing complexity, including floral motifs and calligraphy as well as geometric patterns.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nTile at Topkapi Palace Istanbul.jpg|Tile in the [[Topkapi Palace]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]\nEnderun library Topkapi 42.JPG|Enderun library, Topkapi Palace\nWindow Apartments of the Crown Prince.JPG|Window Apartments of the Crown Prince, Topkapi Palace\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Nadir Madrasah Phoenix.JPG|thumb|Phoenix on the portal of Nadir Divan-Beghi Madrasah, [[Bukhara]], [[Uzbekistan]]]]\nIslamic buildings in [[Bukhara]] in central Asia (16th-17th century) also exhibit very sophisticated floral ornaments. In [[South Asia]] monuments and shrines adorned with [[Qashani|Kashi]] tile work from Persia became a distinct feature of the shrines of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]]. The [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore stands out as one of the masterpieces of Kashi time work from the [[Mughal period]].\n\n[[File:Mekhnes Place El-Hedine Mosaique2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zellige]] tilework in the [[Palace El-Hedine]], [[Meknes]], [[Morocco]]]]\nThe [[zellige]] tradition of Arabic [[North Africa]] uses small colored tiles of various shapes to make very complex geometric patterns. It is halfway to mosaic, but as the different shapes must be fitted precisely together, it falls under tiling. The use of small coloured glass fields also make it rather like [[enamelling]], but with ceramic rather than metal as the support.\n\n[[File:WindowCrestAzulejos.JPG|thumb|right|[[Casa de los Azulejos]], [[Mexico City]], 18th century, with [[azulejo]]s]]\n[[Azulejo]]s are derived from [[zellige]], and the name is likewise derived. The term is both a simple Portuguese and Spanish term for zellige, and a term for later tilework following the tradition. Some azujelos are small-scale geometric patterns or vegetative motifs, some are blue monochrome and highly pictorial, and some are neither. The [[Baroque]] period produced extremely large painted scenes on tiles, usually in blue and white, for walls. [[Azulejo]]s were also used in Latin American architecture.\n\n<gallery>\nBeja26.jpg|[[Quadra (architecture)]] of [[St. John the Baptist]] covered with azulejos in carpet style (17th c.); [[Museu da Reinha D.

Religious and secular stories were depicted. The imaginary tiles with [[Old testament]] scenes shown on the floor in [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|''Annunciation'' in Washington]] are an example.

Several 18th century royal palaces had porcelain rooms with the walls entirely covered in porcelain in tiles or panels.  Surviving examples include ones at [[Museo di Capodimonte|Capodimonte]], Naples, the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] and the nearby [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]].\n\n=== Far East ===\nThere are several other types of traditional tiles that remain in manufacture, for example the small, almost mosaic, brightly colored zellige tiles of [[Morocco]] and the surrounding countries. With exceptions, notably the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing]], decorated tiles or glazed bricks do not feature largely in East Asian ceramics.\n[[File:Demorganducks.jpg|right|thumb|[[William de Morgan]], fantastic ducks on 6-inch tile with luster highlights, Fulham period]]\n\n=== Modern Europe ===\nThe Victorian period saw a great revival in tilework, largely as part of the [[Gothic Revival]], but also the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]]. Patterned tiles, or tiles making up patterns, were now mass-produced by machine and reliably level for floors and cheap to produce, especially for churches, schools and public buildings, but also for domestic hallways and bathrooms. For many uses the tougher [[encaustic tile]] was used. Wall tiles in various styles also revived; the rise of the bathroom contributing greatly to this, as well as greater appreciation of the benefit of [[hygiene]] in kitchens. [[William De Morgan]] was the leading English designer working in tiles, strongly influenced by Islamic designs.\n\nSince the Victorian period tiles have remained standard for kitchens and bathrooms, and many types of public area.\n\n[[File:Quiosco modernista Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A late [[Art Nouveau]] kiosk (1923) in [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] covered with tiles from [[Manises]], Spain.]]\n\nPortugal and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]] continue their tradition of ''azulejo'' tilework today, with [[azulejo]]s used to decorate buildings, ships,<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://installationmag.com/trafaria-praia-on-the-waterfront/\n| title       = Archived copy\n| accessdate  = 18 August 2016\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170109050534/http://installationmag.com/trafaria-praia-on-the-waterfront/\n| archivedate = 9 January 2017\n}}</ref> and even rocks.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Casa da M\u00fasica.

Modern materials such as [[concrete]], glass and [[plastic]] are also used and some clay tiles have a waterproof glaze. A large number of shapes (or \"profiles\") of roof tiles have evolved.\n\n== Floor tiles ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Symmetry]] -->\n[[File:Making mosaic tiles.webm|thumb|Making mosaic tiles]]\n[[File:QVB mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|The elaborate floor pattern of the Sydney [[Queen Victoria Building]]]]\n[[File:Cyprus floor tile.jpg|thumb|right|Floor tile in Karpas, northeastern [[Cyprus]]]]\n[[File:6\"x6\" porcelain floor tiles.jpg|thumb|right|6\"x6\" porcelain floor tiles]]\n[[File:Stone tile patio, Hawaii, 1960.JPG|thumb|left|[[Patio]] with stone tile, [[Hawaii]], US 1960]]\nThese are commonly made of ceramic or stone, although recent technological advances have resulted in rubber or [[glass tiles]] for floors as well. Ceramic tiles may be painted and glazed. Small mosaic tiles may be laid in various patterns. Floor tiles are typically set into [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] consisting of [[sand]], [[cement]] and often a [[latex]] additive for extra adhesion. The spaces between the tiles are commonly filled with sanded or unsanded floor [[grout]], but traditionally mortar was used.<ref>https://goodguyflooring.com/blogs/home-improvement-blog/diy-guide-how-to-install-tile-flooring</ref>\n\nNatural stone tiles can be beautiful but as a natural product they are less uniform in color and pattern, and require more planning for use and installation. Mass-produced stone tiles are uniform in width and length. Granite or marble tiles are sawn on both sides and then polished or finished on the top surface so that they have a uniform thickness. Other natural stone tiles such as slate are typically \"riven\" (split) on the top surface so that the thickness of the tile varies slightly from one spot on the tile to another and from one tile to another. Variations in tile thickness can be handled by adjusting the amount of mortar under each part of the tile, by using wide grout lines that \"ramp\" between different thicknesses, or by using a cold chisel to knock off high spots.\n\nSome stone tiles such as polished granite, marble, and travertine are very slippery when wet. Stone tiles with a riven (split) surface such as slate or with a sawn and then sandblasted or honed surface will be more slip-resistant. Ceramic tiles for use in wet areas can be made more slip-resistant either by using very small tiles so that the grout lines acts as grooves or by imprinting a contour pattern onto the face of the tile.\n\nThe hardness of natural stone tiles varies such that some of the softer stone (e.g. limestone) tiles are not suitable for very heavy-traffic floor areas. On the other hand, ceramic tiles typically have a glazed upper surface and when that becomes scratched or pitted the floor looks worn, whereas the same amount of wear on natural stone tiles will not show, or will be less noticeable.\n\nNatural stone tiles can be stained by spilled liquids; they must be sealed and periodically resealed with a sealant in contrast to ceramic tiles which only need their grout lines sealed. However, because of the complex, nonrepeating patterns in natural stone, small amounts of dirt on many natural stone floor tiles do not show.\n\nThe tendency of floor tiles to stain depends not only on a sealant being applied, and periodically reapplied, but also on their porosity or how porous the stone is. Slate is an example of a less porous stone while limestone is an example of a more porous stone. Different granites and marbles have different porosities with the less porous ones being more valued and more expensive.\n\nMost vendors of stone tiles emphasize that there will be variation in color and pattern from one batch of tiles to another of the same description and variation within the same batch. Stone floor tiles tend to be heavier than ceramic tiles and somewhat more prone to breakage during shipment.\n\nRubber floor tiles have a variety of uses, both in residential and commercial settings. They are especially useful in situations where it is desired to have high-traction floors or protection for an easily breakable floor. Some common uses include flooring of garage, workshops, patios, swimming pool decks, sport courts, gyms, and dance floors. These tiles can also be useful as impact resistance flooring for senior citizens and those who have sensitive joints.\n\nPlastic floor tiles including interlocking floor tiles that can be installed without adhesive or glue are a recent innovation and are suitable for areas subject to heavy traffic, wet areas and floors that are subject to movement, damp or contamination from oil, grease or other substances that may prevent adhesion to the substrate. Common uses include old factory floors, garages, gyms and sports complexes, schools and shops.\n\n== Ceiling tiles ==\n{{main|Ceiling tile}}\nCeiling tiles are lightweight tiles used inside buildings. They are placed in an aluminium grid; they provide little thermal insulation but are generally designed either to improve the acoustics of a room or to reduce the volume of air being heated or cooled.\n\nMineral fiber tiles are fabricated from a range of products; wet felt tiles can be manufactured from perlite, mineral wool, and fibers from recycled paper; stone wool tiles are created by combining molten stone and binders which is then spun to create the tile; gypsum tiles are based on the soft mineral and then finished with vinyl, paper or a decorative face.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nCeiling tiles very often have patterns on the front face; these are there in most circumstances to aid with the tiles ability to improve acoustics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nCeiling tiles also provide a barrier to the spread of smoke and fire. Breaking, displacing, or removing ceiling tiles enables hot gases and smoke from a fire to rise and accumulate above detectors and sprinklers. Doing so delays their activation, enabling fires to grow more rapidly.<ref>[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo16742 Missing Ceiling Tiles.] Washington, D.C.: [[United States Congress Office of Compliance]], 2008.</ref>\n\nCeiling tiles, especially in old Mediterranean houses, were made of terracotta and were placed on top of the wooden ceiling beams and upon those were placed the roof tiles. They were then plastered or painted, but nowadays are usually left bare for decorative purposes.\n\nModern-day tile ceilings may be flush mounted (nail up or glue up) or installed as [[dropped ceiling]]s.\n\n== Materials and processes ==\n=== Ceramic ===\nCeramic materials for tiles include [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]] and [[porcelain]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Terracotta]] is a traditional material used for roof tiles.<ref>{{Cite book\n| url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=xaKWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA271\n| title       = Environmentally Friendly Cities: Proceedings of Plea 1998, Passive and Low Energy Architecture, 1998, Lisbon, Portugal, June 1998\n| last        = Maldonado\n| first       = Eduardo\n| date        = 19 November 2014\n| publisher   = Routledge\n| isbn        = 978-1-134-25622-8\n| language    = en\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180506165629/https://books.google.com/books?id=xaKWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA271&dq=Terracotta+is+a+traditional+material+used+for+roof+tiles.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi49vD_h93XAhUN0mMKHUFrA9gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Terracotta%20is%20a%20traditional%20material%20used%20for%20roof%20tiles.&f=false\n| archivedate = 6 May 2018\n}}</ref>\n\n==== Porcelain tiles ====\n{{Main|Porcelain tile}}\n\nThis is a US term, and defined in [[ASTM]] standard C242 as a ceramic mosaic tile or paver that is generally made by dust-pressing and of a composition yielding a tile that is dense, fine-grained, and smooth, with sharply-formed face, usually impervious.

Tile is a manufactured piece of hard-wearing material such as [[ceramic]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], metal, baked clay, or even [[glass]], generally used for covering roofs, floors, walls, or other objects such as tabletops.  Alternatively, tile can sometimes refer to similar units made from lightweight materials such as [[perlite]], [[wood]], and [[mineral wool]], typically used for wall and ceiling applications. In another sense, a tile is a construction tile or similar object, such as rectangular counters used in playing games (see [[tile-based game]]). The word is derived from the [[French Language|French]] word ''tuile'', which is, in turn, from the [[Latin Language|Latin]] word ''tegula'', meaning a roof tile composed of fired clay.\n\nTiles are often used to form wall and floor coverings, and can range from simple square tiles to complex or [[mosaic]]s.  Tiles are most often made of [[pottery|ceramic]], typically glazed for internal uses and unglazed for roofing, but other materials are also commonly used, such as glass, cork, [[concrete]] and other composite materials, and stone. Tiling stone is typically marble, onyx, granite or slate. Thinner tiles can be used on walls than on floors, which require more durable surfaces that will resist impacts.\n\n== Decorative tile work and coloured brick ==\n[[File:Grande Maison de Blanc Fleurs.JPG|thumb|[[Art Nouveau]] tiles in [[Bruxelles]] ([[Belgium]])]]\n\nDecorative tilework or [[tile art]] should be distinguished from [[mosaic]], where forms are made of great numbers of tiny irregularly positioned [[tesserae]], each of a single color, usually of glass or sometimes ceramic or stone.\n\n== History ==\n{{globalize|date=August 2016}}\n\n===Ancient Middle East===\nThe earliest evidence of glazed brick is the discovery of glazed bricks in the [[Elamite language|Elamite]] Temple at [[Chogha Zanbil]], dated to the 13th century BC. Glazed and colored bricks were used to make low reliefs in Ancient [[Mesopotamia]], most famously the [[Ishtar Gate]] of [[Babylon]] (ca. 575 BC), now partly reconstructed in [[Berlin]], with sections elsewhere. Mesopotamian craftsmen were imported for the palaces of the [[Persian Empire]] such as [[Persepolis]].\n\nThe use of sun-dried bricks or adobe was the main method of building in [[Mesopotamia]] where river mud was found in abundance along the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]]. Here the scarcity of stone may have been an incentive to develop the technology of making kiln-fired bricks to use as an alternative. To strengthen walls made from sun-dried bricks, fired bricks began to be used as an outer protective skin for more important buildings like temples, palaces, city walls and gates. Making fired bricks is an advanced pottery technique. Fired bricks are solid masses of [[clay]] heated in kilns to temperatures of between 950\u00b0 and 1,150\u00b0[[Celsius|C]], and a well-made fired brick is an extremely durable object. Like sun-dried bricks they were made in wooden molds but for bricks with relief decorations special molds had to be made.\n\n=== Ancient Indian subcontinent ===\nRooms with tiled floors made of clay decorated with geometric circular patterns have been discovered from the ancient remains of [[Kalibangan]], [[Kot Bala|Balakot]] and Ahladino<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.202140|quote=kalibangan tiles.|title=Indian History|year=1926|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259063237|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1AJO2A-CbccC&pg=PA218&lpg=PA218&dq=balakot+tiles+indus+valley&source=bl&ots=jcjUAvvfQ1&sig=eBjMQ80bDuX8BiWjyb6_VdkPPEU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjY9MTI_PHcAhVJYo8KHWZ6A8IQ6AEwDnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&q=balakot%20tiles%20indus%20valley&f=false|title=The Ancient Indus Valley: New Perspectives|last=McIntosh|first=Jane|date=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781576079072|language=en}}</ref>\n\nTiling was used in the second century by the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] kings of ancient [[Sri Lanka]], using smoothed and polished stone laid on floors and in swimming pools.

First half of the 15th century, [[Shah-i-Zinda]]]]\nThe golden age of Persian tilework began during the [[Timurid Empire]]. In the [[moraq]] technique, single-color tiles were cut into small geometric pieces and assembled by pouring liquid plaster between them. After hardening, these panels were assembled on the walls of buildings. But the mosaic was not limited to flat areas. Tiles were used to cover both the interior and exterior surfaces of domes. Prominent Timurid examples of this technique include the [[Jame mosque of Yazd|Jame Mosque]] of [[Yazd]] (AD 1324\u20131365), [[Goharshad Mosque]] (AD 1418), the Madrassa of Khan in Shiraz (AD 1615), and the [[Molana Mosque]] (AD 1444).<ref name=\"HistoryOfIranianTile\" />\n\nOther important tile techniques of this time include [[girih tiles]], with their characteristic white girih, or straps.\n\n[[Mihrab]]s, being the focal points of mosques, were usually the places where most sophisticated tilework was placed. The 14th-century mihrab at Madrasa Imami in [[Isfahan]] is an outstanding example of aesthetic union between the [[Islamic calligraphy|Islamic calligrapher's art]] and abstract ornament. The [[Ogive#Architecture|pointed arch]], framing the mihrab's niche, bears an inscription in Kufic script used in 9th-century [[Qur'an]].<ref name=\"Gardner\">{{cite book\n| title  = Gardner's Art Through The Ages, A Global History\n| author = Fred S.

Its dome is a prime example of tile mosaic and its winter praying hall houses one of the finest ensembles of ''[[cuerda seca]]'' tiles in the world. A wide variety of tiles had to be manufactured in order to cover complex forms of the hall with consistent mosaic patterns. The result was a technological triumph as well as a dazzling display of abstract ornament.<ref name=\"Gardner\" />\n\nDuring the [[Safavid Empire|Safavid period]], mosaic ornaments were often replaced by a ''haft rang'' (seven colors) technique. Pictures were painted on plain rectangle tiles, glazed and fired afterwards. Besides economic reasons, the seven colors method gave more freedom to artists and was less time-consuming. It was popular until the [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar period]], when the palette of colors was extended by yellow and orange.<ref name=\"HistoryOfIranianTile\" /> The seven colors of Haft Rang tiles were usually [[black]], [[white]], [[ultramarine]], [[Turquoise (color)|turquoise]], [[red]], [[yellow]] and [[Fawn (colour)|fawn]].\n\n[[File:001117 15-44-2002-To-grupper-rosa-Qajar-Fliser2.jpg|200px|thumbnail|right|Two panels of [[earthenware]] tiles painted with [[polychrome]] [[Ceramic glaze|glazes]] over a white glaze. (Iran 19thC)]]\nThe [[Persianate]] tradition continued and spread to much of the Islamic world, notably the [[\u0130znik pottery]] of [[Turkey]] under the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the 16th and 17th centuries. Palaces, public buildings, [[mosque]]s and [[t\u00fcrbe]] mausoleums were heavily decorated with large brightly colored patterns, typically with floral motifs, and [[frieze]]s of astonishing complexity, including floral motifs and calligraphy as well as geometric patterns.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\" perrow=\"4\">\nTile at Topkapi Palace Istanbul.jpg|Tile in the [[Topkapi Palace]], [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]]\nEnderun library Topkapi 42.JPG|Enderun library, Topkapi Palace\nWindow Apartments of the Crown Prince.JPG|Window Apartments of the Crown Prince, Topkapi Palace\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Nadir Madrasah Phoenix.JPG|thumb|Phoenix on the portal of Nadir Divan-Beghi Madrasah, [[Bukhara]], [[Uzbekistan]]]]\nIslamic buildings in [[Bukhara]] in central Asia (16th-17th century) also exhibit very sophisticated floral ornaments. In [[South Asia]] monuments and shrines adorned with [[Qashani|Kashi]] tile work from Persia became a distinct feature of the shrines of [[Multan]] and [[Sindh]]. The [[Wazir Khan Mosque]] in Lahore stands out as one of the masterpieces of Kashi time work from the [[Mughal period]].\n\n[[File:Mekhnes Place El-Hedine Mosaique2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Zellige]] tilework in the [[Palace El-Hedine]], [[Meknes]], [[Morocco]]]]\nThe [[zellige]] tradition of Arabic [[North Africa]] uses small colored tiles of various shapes to make very complex geometric patterns. It is halfway to mosaic, but as the different shapes must be fitted precisely together, it falls under tiling. The use of small coloured glass fields also make it rather like [[enamelling]], but with ceramic rather than metal as the support.\n\n[[File:WindowCrestAzulejos.JPG|thumb|right|[[Casa de los Azulejos]], [[Mexico City]], 18th century, with [[azulejo]]s]]\n[[Azulejo]]s are derived from [[zellige]], and the name is likewise derived. The term is both a simple Portuguese and Spanish term for zellige, and a term for later tilework following the tradition. Some azujelos are small-scale geometric patterns or vegetative motifs, some are blue monochrome and highly pictorial, and some are neither. The [[Baroque]] period produced extremely large painted scenes on tiles, usually in blue and white, for walls. [[Azulejo]]s were also used in Latin American architecture.\n\n<gallery>\nBeja26.jpg|[[Quadra (architecture)]] of [[St. John the Baptist]] covered with azulejos in carpet style (17th c.); [[Museu da Reinha D.

Religious and secular stories were depicted. The imaginary tiles with [[Old testament]] scenes shown on the floor in [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 [[Annunciation (van Eyck, Washington)|''Annunciation'' in Washington]] are an example.

Several 18th century royal palaces had porcelain rooms with the walls entirely covered in porcelain in tiles or panels.  Surviving examples include ones at [[Museo di Capodimonte|Capodimonte]], Naples, the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]] and the nearby [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez]].\n\n=== Far East ===\nThere are several other types of traditional tiles that remain in manufacture, for example the small, almost mosaic, brightly colored zellige tiles of [[Morocco]] and the surrounding countries. With exceptions, notably the [[Porcelain Tower of Nanjing]], decorated tiles or glazed bricks do not feature largely in East Asian ceramics.\n[[File:Demorganducks.jpg|right|thumb|[[William de Morgan]], fantastic ducks on 6-inch tile with luster highlights, Fulham period]]\n\n=== Modern Europe ===\nThe Victorian period saw a great revival in tilework, largely as part of the [[Gothic Revival]], but also the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]]. Patterned tiles, or tiles making up patterns, were now mass-produced by machine and reliably level for floors and cheap to produce, especially for churches, schools and public buildings, but also for domestic hallways and bathrooms. For many uses the tougher [[encaustic tile]] was used. Wall tiles in various styles also revived; the rise of the bathroom contributing greatly to this, as well as greater appreciation of the benefit of [[hygiene]] in kitchens. [[William De Morgan]] was the leading English designer working in tiles, strongly influenced by Islamic designs.\n\nSince the Victorian period tiles have remained standard for kitchens and bathrooms, and many types of public area.\n\n[[File:Quiosco modernista Gran Canaria.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A late [[Art Nouveau]] kiosk (1923) in [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]] covered with tiles from [[Manises]], Spain.]]\n\nPortugal and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]] continue their tradition of ''azulejo'' tilework today, with [[azulejo]]s used to decorate buildings, ships,<ref>{{cite web\n| url         = http://installationmag.com/trafaria-praia-on-the-waterfront/\n| title       = Archived copy\n| accessdate  = 18 August 2016\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20170109050534/http://installationmag.com/trafaria-praia-on-the-waterfront/\n| archivedate = 9 January 2017\n}}</ref> and even rocks.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Casa da M\u00fasica.

Modern materials such as [[concrete]], glass and [[plastic]] are also used and some clay tiles have a waterproof glaze. A large number of shapes (or \"profiles\") of roof tiles have evolved.\n\n== Floor tiles ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Symmetry]] -->\n[[File:Making mosaic tiles.webm|thumb|Making mosaic tiles]]\n[[File:QVB mosaic.jpg|thumb|left|The elaborate floor pattern of the Sydney [[Queen Victoria Building]]]]\n[[File:Cyprus floor tile.jpg|thumb|right|Floor tile in Karpas, northeastern [[Cyprus]]]]\n[[File:6\"x6\" porcelain floor tiles.jpg|thumb|right|6\"x6\" porcelain floor tiles]]\n[[File:Stone tile patio, Hawaii, 1960.JPG|thumb|left|[[Patio]] with stone tile, [[Hawaii]], US 1960]]\nThese are commonly made of ceramic or stone, although recent technological advances have resulted in rubber or [[glass tiles]] for floors as well. Ceramic tiles may be painted and glazed. Small mosaic tiles may be laid in various patterns. Floor tiles are typically set into [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]] consisting of [[sand]], [[cement]] and often a [[latex]] additive for extra adhesion. The spaces between the tiles are commonly filled with sanded or unsanded floor [[grout]], but traditionally mortar was used.\n\nNatural stone tiles can be beautiful but as a natural product they are less uniform in color and pattern, and require more planning for use and installation. Mass-produced stone tiles are uniform in width and length. Granite or marble tiles are sawn on both sides and then polished or finished on the top surface so that they have a uniform thickness. Other natural stone tiles such as slate are typically \"riven\" (split) on the top surface so that the thickness of the tile varies slightly from one spot on the tile to another and from one tile to another. Variations in tile thickness can be handled by adjusting the amount of mortar under each part of the tile, by using wide grout lines that \"ramp\" between different thicknesses, or by using a cold chisel to knock off high spots.\n\nSome stone tiles such as polished granite, marble, and travertine are very slippery when wet. Stone tiles with a riven (split) surface such as slate or with a sawn and then sandblasted or honed surface will be more slip-resistant. Ceramic tiles for use in wet areas can be made more slip-resistant either by using very small tiles so that the grout lines acts as grooves or by imprinting a contour pattern onto the face of the tile.\n\nThe hardness of natural stone tiles varies such that some of the softer stone (e.g. limestone) tiles are not suitable for very heavy-traffic floor areas. On the other hand, ceramic tiles typically have a glazed upper surface and when that becomes scratched or pitted the floor looks worn, whereas the same amount of wear on natural stone tiles will not show, or will be less noticeable.\n\nNatural stone tiles can be stained by spilled liquids; they must be sealed and periodically resealed with a sealant in contrast to ceramic tiles which only need their grout lines sealed. However, because of the complex, nonrepeating patterns in natural stone, small amounts of dirt on many natural stone floor tiles do not show.\n\nThe tendency of floor tiles to stain depends not only on a sealant being applied, and periodically reapplied, but also on their porosity or how porous the stone is. Slate is an example of a less porous stone while limestone is an example of a more porous stone. Different granites and marbles have different porosities with the less porous ones being more valued and more expensive.\n\nMost vendors of stone tiles emphasize that there will be variation in color and pattern from one batch of tiles to another of the same description and variation within the same batch. Stone floor tiles tend to be heavier than ceramic tiles and somewhat more prone to breakage during shipment.\n\nRubber floor tiles have a variety of uses, both in residential and commercial settings. They are especially useful in situations where it is desired to have high-traction floors or protection for an easily breakable floor. Some common uses include flooring of garage, workshops, patios, swimming pool decks, sport courts, gyms, and dance floors.\n\nPlastic floor tiles including interlocking floor tiles that can be installed without adhesive or glue are a recent innovation and are suitable for areas subject to heavy traffic, wet areas and floors that are subject to movement, damp or contamination from oil, grease or other substances that may prevent adhesion to the substrate. Common uses include old factory floors, garages, gyms and sports complexes, schools and shops.\n\n== Ceiling tiles ==\n{{main|Ceiling tile}}\nCeiling tiles are lightweight tiles used inside buildings. They are placed in an aluminium grid; they provide little thermal insulation but are generally designed either to improve the acoustics of a room or to reduce the volume of air being heated or cooled.\n\nMineral fiber tiles are fabricated from a range of products; wet felt tiles can be manufactured from perlite, mineral wool, and fibers from recycled paper; stone wool tiles are created by combining molten stone and binders which is then spun to create the tile; gypsum tiles are based on the soft mineral and then finished with vinyl, paper or a decorative face.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nCeiling tiles very often have patterns on the front face; these are there in most circumstances to aid with the tiles ability to improve acoustics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nCeiling tiles also provide a barrier to the spread of smoke and fire. Breaking, displacing, or removing ceiling tiles enables hot gases and smoke from a fire to rise and accumulate above detectors and sprinklers. Doing so delays their activation, enabling fires to grow more rapidly.<ref>[https://purl.fdlp.gov/GPO/gpo16742 Missing Ceiling Tiles.] Washington, D.C.: [[United States Congress Office of Compliance]], 2008.</ref>\n\nCeiling tiles, especially in old Mediterranean houses, were made of terracotta and were placed on top of the wooden ceiling beams and upon those were placed the roof tiles. They were then plastered or painted, but nowadays are usually left bare for decorative purposes.\n\nModern-day tile ceilings may be flush mounted (nail up or glue up) or installed as [[dropped ceiling]]s.\n\n== Materials and processes ==\n=== Ceramic ===\nCeramic materials for tiles include [[earthenware]], [[stoneware]] and [[porcelain]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} [[Terracotta]] is a traditional material used for roof tiles.<ref>{{Cite book\n| url         = https://books.google.com/books?id=xaKWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA271\n| title       = Environmentally Friendly Cities: Proceedings of Plea 1998, Passive and Low Energy Architecture, 1998, Lisbon, Portugal, June 1998\n| last        = Maldonado\n| first       = Eduardo\n| date        = 19 November 2014\n| publisher   = Routledge\n| isbn        = 978-1-134-25622-8\n| language    = en\n| url-status     = live\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180506165629/https://books.google.com/books?id=xaKWBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA271&dq=Terracotta+is+a+traditional+material+used+for+roof+tiles.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi49vD_h93XAhUN0mMKHUFrA9gQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Terracotta%20is%20a%20traditional%20material%20used%20for%20roof%20tiles.&f=false\n| archivedate = 6 May 2018\n}}</ref>\n\n==== Porcelain tiles ====\n{{Main|Porcelain tile}}\n\nThis is a US term, and defined in [[ASTM]] standard C242 as a ceramic mosaic tile or paver that is generally made by dust-pressing and of a composition yielding a tile that is dense, fine-grained, and smooth, with sharply-formed face, usually impervious.

Compared with the [[laser engraving]]s, diamond etching is in almost every circumstance more permanent.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\n== Mathematics of tiling ==\nCertain shapes of tiles, most obviously [[rectangle]]s, can be replicated to cover a surface with no gaps. These shapes are said to ''[[Tessellation|tessellate]]'' (from the [[Latin]] ''tessella'', 'tile') and such a tiling is called a [[tessellation]]. Geometric patterns of some Islamic polychrome decorative tilings are rather complicated (see [[Islamic geometric patterns]] and, in particular, [[Girih tiles]]), even up to supposedly quaziperiodic ones, similar to [[Penrose tiling#Penrose tilings and art|Penrose tilings]].\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book\n| author1       = Carboni, S.\n| author2       = Masuya, T.\n| lastauthoramp = yes\n| title         = ''Persian tiles''\n| location      = New York\n| publisher     = The Metropolitan Museum of Art\n| year          = 1993\n| url           = http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/90309\n}}\n* Marilyn Y.

It met in [[Washington, D.C.]], from March 4, 1889, to March 4, 1891, during the first two years of the [[Presidency of Benjamin Harrison|administration]] of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Benjamin Harrison]].\n\nThe apportionment of seats in this [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was based on the [[United States Census, 1880|Tenth Census of the United States in 1880]]. Both chambers had a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] majority. This marked the first time since the [[43rd United States Congress]] that both chambers were controlled by the president's party.\n\n{{TOCLimit|2}}\n\n== Major events ==\n{{Main|1889 in the United States|1890 in the United States|1891 in the United States}}\n* March 4, 1889: [[Benjamin Harrison]] became [[President of the United States]]\n* December 29, 1890: [[Wounded Knee Massacre]]\n\n== Major legislation ==\n[[Image:Billion dollar Congress.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Harrison]] and the Congress are portrayed as a \"Billion-Dollar Congress,\" wasting the surplus in this cartoon from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]''.]]\n{{Main|List of United States federal legislation#51st United States Congress}}\nIt was responsible for a number of pieces of landmark legislation, many of which asserted the authority of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].\n\nEmboldened by their success in the elections of 1888, the Republicans enacted virtually their entire platform during their first 303-day session, including a measure that provided [[American Civil War]] veterans with generous pensions and expanded the list of eligible recipients to include noncombatants and the children of veterans. [[Grover Cleveland]] had vetoed a similar bill in 1887. It was criticized as the \"Billion Dollar Congress'\" for its lavish spending and, for this reason it incited drastic reversals in public support that led to [[1892 United States presidential election|Cleveland's reelection in 1892]].\n\nOther important legislation passed into law by the Congress included the [[McKinley tariff]], authored by Representative, and future President, [[William McKinley]]; the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], which prohibited business combinations that restricted trade; and the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], which required the U.S. government to mint [[silver]]. The last two were concessions to Western farmer interests in exchange for support of the tariff and would become central tenets of the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] later in the decade. They were authored by Senator [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]].\n\nThe Fifty-first Congress was also responsible for passing the [[Land Revision Act of 1891]], which created the [[U.S. National Forest|national forests]]. Harrison authorized America's first forest reserve in [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], [[Wyoming]], the same year.\n\nOther bills were discussed but failed to pass, including two significant pieces of legislation focused on ensuring African Americans the right to vote. [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] sponsored a so-called [[Lodge Bill]] that would have established federal supervision of Congressional elections so as to prevent the disfranchisement of southern blacks. [[Henry W. Blair]] sponsored the [[Blair Education Bill]], which advocated the use of federal aid for education in order to frustrate southern whites employing literacy tests to prevent blacks from registering to vote.\n\n* June 27, 1890: [[Dependent Pension Act]]\n* July 2, 1890: [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], ch. 647, {{USStat|26|209}}\n* July 14, 1890: [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], ch. 708, {{USStat|26|289}}\n* August 30, 1890: [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]]\n* October 1, 1890: [[McKinley Tariff]], ch. 1244, {{USStat|26|567}}\n* March 3, 1891: [[Forest Reserve Act of 1891]]\n* March 3, 1891: [[Land Revision Act of 1891]]\n* March 3, 1891: [[Immigration Act of 1891]]\n* March 3, 1891: [[Merchant Marine Act of 1891]]\n* March 3, 1891: [[International Copyright Act of 1891|International Copyright Act (The Chace Act)]]\n\n== States admitted and territories organized ==\n* November 2, 1889: [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]] were admitted as the 39th and 40th states.\n* November 8, 1889: [[Montana]] was admitted as the 41st state.\n* November 11, 1889: [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] was admitted as the 42nd state.\n* May 2, 1890: [[Oklahoma Territory]] was organized.\n* July 3, 1890: [[Idaho]] was admitted as the 43rd state.\n* July 10, 1890: [[Wyoming]] was admitted as the 44th state.\n\n== Party summary ==\n\nThe count below identifies party affiliations at the beginning of this Congress.

It met in [[Washington, D.C.]], from March 4, 1889, to March 4, 1891, during the first two years of the [[Presidency of Benjamin Harrison|administration]] of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Benjamin Harrison]].\n\nThe apportionment of seats in this [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] was based on the [[United States Census, 1880|Tenth Census of the United States in 1880]]. Both chambers had a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] majority. This marked the first time since the [[43rd United States Congress]] that both chambers were controlled by the president's party.\n\n{{TOCLimit|2}}\n\n== Major events ==\n{{Main|1889 in the United States|1890 in the United States|1891 in the United States}}\n* March 4, 1889: [[Benjamin Harrison]] became [[President of the United States]]\n* December 29, 1890: [[Wounded Knee Massacre]]\n\n== Major legislation ==\n[[Image:Billion dollar Congress.jpg|thumb|[[Benjamin Harrison]] and the Congress are portrayed as a \"Billion-Dollar Congress,\" wasting the surplus in this cartoon from ''[[Puck (magazine)|Puck]]''.]]\n{{Main|List of United States federal legislation#51st United States Congress}}\nIt was responsible for a number of pieces of landmark legislation, many of which asserted the authority of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]].\n\nEmboldened by their success in the elections of 1888, the Republicans enacted virtually their entire platform during their first 303-day session, including a measure that provided [[American Civil War]] veterans with generous pensions and expanded the list of eligible recipients to include noncombatants and the children of veterans. [[Grover Cleveland]] had vetoed a similar bill in 1887. It was criticized as the \"Billion Dollar Congress'\" for its lavish spending and, for this reason it incited drastic reversals in public support that led to [[1892 United States presidential election|Cleveland's reelection in 1892]].\n\nOther important legislation passed into law by the Congress included the [[McKinley tariff]], authored by Representative, and future President, [[William McKinley]]; the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], which prohibited business combinations that restricted trade; and the [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], which required the U.S. government to mint [[silver]]. The last two were concessions to Western farmer interests in exchange for support of the tariff and would become central tenets of the [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist Party]] later in the decade. They were authored by Senator [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]].\n\nThe Fifty-first Congress was also responsible for passing the [[Land Revision Act of 1891]], which created the [[U.S. National Forest|national forests]]. Harrison authorized America's first forest reserve in [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]], [[Wyoming]], the same year.\n\nOther bills were discussed but failed to pass, including two significant pieces of legislation focused on ensuring African Americans the right to vote. [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] sponsored a so-called [[Lodge Bill]] that would have established federal supervision of Congressional elections so as to prevent the disfranchisement of southern blacks. [[Henry W. Blair]] sponsored the [[Blair Education Bill]], which advocated the use of federal aid for education in order to frustrate southern whites employing literacy tests to prevent blacks from registering to vote.\n\n* June 27, 1890: [[Dependent Pension Act]]\n* July 2, 1890: [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], ch. 647, {{USStat|26|209}}\n* July 14, 1890: [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]], ch. 708, {{USStat|26|289}}\n* August 30, 1890: [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]]\n* October 1, 1890: [[McKinley Tariff]], ch. 1244, {{USStat|26|567}}\n* March 3, 1891: [[Forest Reserve Act of 1891]]\n* March 3, 1891: [[Land Revision Act of 1891]]\n* March 3, 1891: [[Immigration Act of 1891]]\n* March 3, 1891: [[Merchant Marine Act of 1891]]\n* March 3, 1891: [[International Copyright Act of 1891|International Copyright Act (The Chace Act)]]\n\n== States admitted and territories organized ==\n* November 2, 1889: [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]] were admitted as the 39th and 40th states.\n* November 8, 1889: [[Montana]] was admitted as the 41st state.\n* November 11, 1889: [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] was admitted as the 42nd state.\n* May 2, 1890: [[Oklahoma Territory]] was organized.\n* July 3, 1890: [[Idaho]] was admitted as the 43rd state.\n* July 10, 1890: [[Wyoming]] was admitted as the 44th state.\n\n== Party summary ==\n\nThe count below identifies party affiliations at the beginning of this Congress.

Wood is a common choice as a flooring material and can come in various styles, colors, cuts, and species. [[Bamboo floor]]ing is often considered a form of wood flooring, although it is made from a [[grass]] ([[bamboo]]) rather than a timber.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.utk.edu/~mtaylo29/pages/Bamboo%20flooring.htm|title=Bamboo Flooring: Better than wood? |last=Taylor|first=Adam M.|year=2003|publisher=University of Tennessee|accessdate=6 March 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\n1) Single joist timber flooring\n2)Double joist timber flooring\n3)Framed or Triple joist timber flooring\n=== Solid ===\n\n==== Hardwood flooring ====\nSolid [[hardwood]] floors are made of planks milled from a single piece of timber. Solid hardwood floors were originally used for structural purposes, being installed perpendicular to the wooden support beams of a building known as joists or bearers. With the increased use of concrete as a subfloor in some parts of the world and typically lower material cost, engineered wood flooring has gained some popularity. However, solid wood floors are still common and popular. Solid wood floors have a thicker wear surface and can be sanded and finished more times than an engineered wood floor.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vaglica |first1=Sal |title=All About Engineered Wood Floors |url=https://www.thisoldhouse.com/ideas/all-about-engineered-wood-floors |website=This Old House |publisher=This Old House Ventures, LLC |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref> It is not uncommon for homes in New England, Eastern Canada, USA, and Europe to have the original solid wood floor still in use today.\n[[File:Custom Showroom.jpg|thumb|Custom showroom]]\n\n==== Solid wood manufacturing ====\nSolid wood flooring is milled from a single piece of timber that is [[kiln]] or air dried before sawing. Depending on the desired look of the floor, the timber can be cut in three ways: flat-sawn, quarter-sawn, and rift-sawn. The timber is cut to the desired dimensions and either packed unfinished for a site-finished installation or finished at the factory. The moisture content at time of manufacturing is carefully controlled to ensure the product does not warp during transport and storage.\n\nA number of proprietary features for solid wood floors are available. Many solid woods come with grooves cut into the back of the wood that run the length of each plank, often called 'absorption strips,' that are intended to reduce cupping.

Typically, engineered wood flooring uses a thin layer ([[Lamella (materials)|lamella]]) of a more expensive wood bonded to a core constructed from cheaper wood. The increased stability of engineered wood is achieved by running each layer at a 90\u00b0 angle to the layer above. This stability makes it a universal product that can be installed over all types of subfloors above, below or on grade. Engineered wood is the most common type of wood flooring in Europe and has been growing in popularity in North America.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blanchet|first=Pierre|last2=Beauregard|first2=Robert|last3=Cloutier|first3=Alain|last4=Gendron|first4=Guy|last5=Lefebvre|first5=Marcel|date=May 2003|title=Evaluation of various engineered wood flooring constructions|url=|journal=Forest Products Journal|publication-place=Madison|volume=53|issue=5|pages=30-37|issn=00157473|via=ProQuest}}</ref>\n\n[[Laminate flooring|Laminate]] and [[Vinyl composition tile|vinyl]] floors are often confused with engineered wood floors, but are not. Laminate flooring uses an image of wood on its surface, while vinyl flooring is plastic formed to look like wood.\n\nThe several different categories of engineered wood flooring include:\n* All-timber-wood floors made from multiple layers of sawn wood. Most engineered wood flooring is in this category, and does not use rotary-peeled veneer, composite wood (such as HDF), or plastic in their construction.\n* [[Wood veneer|Veneer]] floors use a thin layer of wood over a core that is commonly a composite wood product.\n* Acrylic-impregnated wood flooring uses a layer of wood that is impregnated with liquid acrylic then hardened using a proprietary process.\n\n== Comparison of solid wood with engineered wood ==\nIt is difficult to compare solid wood flooring to engineered wood flooring due to the wide range of quality in both product categories and each type has its limitations. Solid hardwood is more prone than engineered wood flooring to \"gapping\" (excessive space between planks), \"crowning\" (convex curving upwards when humidity increases) and \"cupping\" (a [[wikt:concave|concave]] or \"dished\" appearance of the plank, with the height of the plank along its longer edges being higher than the centre) with increased plank size. Patented installation systems for engineered wood may allow for faster installation and easy replacement of boards.  The fabrication of engineered wood also allows for a floating installation where the planks are not fastened to the subfloor, but to each other using tongue-and-groove edges.

The tongue and groove fit snugly together, thus joining or aligning the planks, and are not visible once joined.  Tongue-and-groove flooring can be installed by glue-down (both engineered and solid), floating (engineered only), or nail-down (both solid and engineered).\n#\"Click\" or Woodloc systems: there are a number of patented \"click\" systems that now exist.  These click systems are either \"unilin\" or \"fiboloc\"  A \"click\" floor is similar to tongue-and-groove, but instead of fitting directly into the groove, the board must be angled or \"tapped\" in to make the curved or barbed tongue fit into the modified groove.  No adhesive is used when installing a \"click\" floor, making board replacement easier.  This system not only exists for engineered wood floors but also [[engineered bamboo]] and a small number of solid floors (such as \"parador solido click\") and is designed to be used for floating installations.  It is beneficial for the Do-It-Yourself market.\n#Floor connection system: There are a wide range of connection systems, as most of them are mill-specific manufacturing techniques.  The general principle is to have grooves on all four sides of the plank with a separate, unconnected, piece that is inserted into the grooves of two planks to join them.  The piece used for the connection can be made from wood, rubber, or plastic.  This installation system allows for different materials (i.e. wood and metal) to be installed together if they have the same connection system.\n#Wood flooring can also be installed utilizing the glue-down method.  This is an especially popular method for solid parquet flooring installations on concrete sub-floors.  Additionally, engineered wood flooring may use the glue-down method as well.  A layer of mastic is placed onto the sub-floor using a trowel similar to those used in laying ceramic tile.  The wood pieces are then laid on top of the glue and hammered into place using a rubber mallet and a protected 2x4 to create a level floor.  Traditionally, parquet floors will require sanding and re-finishing after the glue-down installation method due to the small size pieces. However, most new Engineered Parquet blocks don't require this extra step. \n#Floating installation: A floating installation is where the flooring is installed on top of a layer of underlayment or moisture barrier. The individual planks are glued together using a tongue and groove adhesive such as [[polyvinyl acetate|PVA wood glue]].  Space for expansion should be left at the edges of the room.  Cabinets and walls should not be installed on top of floating floors.

The wood is then oiled.\n\n=== Buffing ===\nGenerally, older solid hardwood floors need to be buffed every 3\u20135 years. The process usually takes about one day. Buffing refers to the process of using a stand up floor buffer. The floor is abraded with 180 grit screen on the buffer. This allows for the new coat of finish to mechanically adhere to the floor.

The timber is cut to the desired dimensions and either packed unfinished for a site-finished installation or finished at the factory. The moisture content at time of manufacturing is carefully controlled to ensure the product does not warp during transport and storage.\n\nA number of proprietary features for solid wood floors are available.

The company developed a [[lobbying|lobby]] in the English parliament.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million.

Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade.

Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

The great expansion came after 1750, when it had 3,000 regular troops. By 1763, it had 26,000; by 1778, it had 67,000. It recruited largely [[sepoy|Indian troops]] and trained them along European lines.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Gerald Bryant |year=1978 |title=Officers of the East India Company's army in the days of Clive and Hastings |journal=The Journal of Imperial and Commonwealth History |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=203\u2013227 |doi=10.1080/03086537808582508}}</ref> The military arm of the East India Company quickly developed into a private corporate armed force used as an instrument of geo-political power and expansion instead of its original purpose as a guard force. Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\n\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The growth of tensions between the EIC and the local religious and cultural groups grew in the 19th century as the Protestant revival grew in Great Britain.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling. This resulted in the [[First Opium War]] (1839\u201342).

The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991). ''The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company''.

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which, among other things:\n* asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the company;\n* renewed the charter of the company for a further twenty years, but\n** deprived the company of its Indian trade monopoly except for trade in tea and the trade with China\n** required the company to maintain separate and distinct its commercial and territorial accounts\n* opened India to missionaries\n\n==== Government of India Act 1833 ====\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic ideology form the background to the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Government of India Act 1833]] (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\n* removed the company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions\n* renewed for another twenty years the company's political and administrative authority\n* invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company.

After occupying premises in [[Philpot Lane]] from 1600 to 1621; in [[Crosby Hall, London|Crosby House]], [[Bishopsgate]], from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726\u20131729; and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796\u20131800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861\u20131862. The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service.

In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India.

In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\n\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London, a private [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired.

The company opened a [[factory (trading post)|factory]] in [[Bantam (city)|Bantam]] on the first voyage, and imports of [[Black pepper|pepper]] from [[Java]] were an important part of the company's trade for twenty years. The factory in Bantam was closed in 1683. During this time ships belonging to the company arriving in India docked at [[Surat]], which was established as a trade transit point in 1608.\n\nIn the next two years, the company established its first factory in south India in the town of [[Machilipatnam]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]] of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. But in 1609 he renewed the charter given to the company for an indefinite period, including a clause that specified that the charter would cease to be in force if the trade turned unprofitable for three consecutive years.\n\n== Foothold in India ==\n{{See also|History of Kolkata#Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)|label 1=Establishment of English trade in Bengal (1600\u20131700)}}\n[[File:Reddragonship.jpg|thumb|{{ship||Red Dragon|1595|2}} fought the Portuguese at the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, and made several voyages to the [[East Indies]]]]\n[[File:Jahangir investing a courtier with a robe of honour watched by Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615-18, and others.jpg|thumb|275px|The emperor [[Jahangir]] investing a courtier with a robe of honour, watched by [[Sir Thomas Roe]], English ambassador to the court of Jahangir at Agra from 1615 to 1618, and others]]\n\nEnglish traders frequently engaged in hostilities with their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the [[Battle of Swally]] in 1612, at [[Suvali]] in [[Surat]]. The company decided to explore the feasibility of gaining a territorial foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the [[Mughal Empire]], and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.<ref name=\"fordham1\">The battle of Plassey ended the tax on the Indian goods.

In return, the company offered to provide the Emperor with goods and rarities from the European market.

It eclipsed the Portuguese [[Estado da \u00cdndia]], which had established bases in [[Goa]], [[Chittagong]], and [[Bombay]] - Portugal later ceded Bombay to England as part of the [[dowry]] of [[Catherine of Braganza]] on her marriage to King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].

With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the [[Anglo-Dutch Wars]] of the 17th and 18th centuries.\n\nWithin the first two decades of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company or ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'', (VOC) was the wealthiest commercial operation in the world with 50,000&nbsp;employees worldwide and a private fleet of 200&nbsp;ships.

The company developed a [[lobbying|lobby]] in the English parliament. Under pressure from ambitious tradesmen and former associates of the company (pejoratively termed ''Interlopers'' by the company), who wanted to establish private trading firms in India, a deregulating act was passed in 1694.<ref name=\"victorianweb.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://victorianweb.org/history/empire/india/eic.html|title=The British East India Company \u2014 the Company that Owned a Nation (or Two)|website=victorianweb.org}}</ref>\n\nThis allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years.

The companies merged in 1708, by a tripartite indenture involving both companies and the state, with the charter and agreement for the new ''United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies'' being awarded by the [[Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3t0TAAAAQAAJ|title=Charters Relating to the East India Company from 1600 to 1761: Reprinted from a Former Collection with Some Additions and a Preface for the Government of Madras|last=Company|first=East India|last2=Shaw|first2=John|date=1887|publisher=R.

The company sought a permanent establishment, while the Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company's profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.\n\nAt this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of \u00a31&nbsp;million. Between 1756 and 1763, the [[Seven Years' War]] diverted the state's attention towards consolidation and [[French and Indian War|defence of its territorial possessions]] in Europe and its [[English colonization of the Americas|colonies in North America]].<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\">Thomas, P.

In 1757, the [[Law Officers of the Crown]] delivered the [[Pratt\u2013Yorke opinion]] distinguishing overseas territories acquired by [[right of conquest]] from those acquired by private [[treaty]]. The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.<ref name=\"oxforddnb.com\" />\n\nWith the advent of the [[Industrial Revolution]], Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain the troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its spiralling cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade.

Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondich\u00e9ry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.\n\nThe East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the [[Boston Tea Party]] in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor [[Thomas Hutchinson (governor)|Thomas Hutchinson]] of the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]] refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain.

Because of this, the EIC became the most powerful military force in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. As it increased in size, the army was divided into the [[Presidency Armies]] of [[Bengal Army|Bengal]], [[Madras Army|Madras]] and [[Bombay Army|Bombay]], each of which recruited its own [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] [[:Category:Honourable East India Company regiments|units]]. The navy also grew significantly, vastly expanding its [[:Category:Ships of the British East India Company|fleet]]. Although heavily armed merchant vessels, called East Indiamen, composed most of the fleet, it also included warships.\n\n==== Expansion and conquest ====\nThe company, fresh from a colossal victory, and with the backing of its own private, well-disciplined, and experienced army, was able to assert its interests in the [[Carnatic (region)|Carnatic region]] from its base at [[Madras]] and in Bengal from Calcutta, without facing any further obstacles from other colonial powers.<ref>{{cite book|author1=James Stuart Olson |author2=Robert Shadle |title=Historical Dictionary of the British Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-X-XYB_ZkIC&pg=PA252|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |pages=252\u2013254|isbn=978-0-313-29366-5}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Shah Alam II, 1790s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Mughal Emperor [[Shah Alam II]], who with his allies fought against the East India Company during his early years (1760\u20131764), accepted the protection of the British in the year 1803, only after he had been blinded by his enemies and deserted by his subjects]]\n\nIt continued to experience resistance from local rulers during its expansion. Robert Clive led company forces against [[Siraj Ud Daulah]], the last independent [[Nawab]] of Bengal, [[Bihar]], and Midnapore district in Odisha to victory at the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, resulting in the conquest of Bengal. This victory estranged the British and the Mughals, since Siraj Ud Daulah was a Mughal feudatory ally. That led to the [[Battle of Buxar]].\n\nWith the gradual weakening of the [[Maratha]]s in the aftermath of the three [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], the British also secured the Ganges-Jumna Doab, the Delhi-Agra region, parts of Bundelkhand, Broach, some districts of Gujarat, the fort of [[Ahmednagar]], [[Cuttack district|province of Cuttack]] (which included Mughalbandi/the coastal part of [[Odisha]], Garjat/the princely states of Odisha, [[Balasore]] Port, parts of [[Midnapore]] district of West Bengal), Bombay ([[Mumbai]]) and the surrounding areas, leading to a formal end of the Maratha empire and firm establishment of the British East India Company in India.\n\n[[Hyder Ali]] and [[Tipu Sultan]], the rulers of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]], offered much resistance to the British forces. Having sided with the French during the Revolutionary War, the rulers of Mysore continued their struggle against the company with the four [[Anglo-Mysore Wars]]. Mysore finally fell to the company forces in 1799, in the fourth Anglo-Mysore war during which Tipu Sultan was killed.\n\n[[File:2-12th Madras Native Infantry at the Battle of Assaye, 1803.

The highest rank to which an Indian soldier could aspire was Subadar-Major (or Risaldar-Major in cavalry units), effectively a senior [[subaltern]] equivalent. Promotion for both British and Indian soldiers was strictly by seniority, so Indian soldiers rarely reached the commissioned ranks of Jamadar or Subadar before they were middle aged at best. They received no training in administration or leadership to make them independent of their British officers.\n\nDuring the wars against the French and their allies in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the East India Company's armies were used to seize the colonial possessions of other European nations, including the islands of [[R\u00e9union]] and [[Mauritius]]. Many [[East Indiaman|East India ships]] were seized by the French based on these islands during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. They were taken by the British in a [[Mauritius campaign of 1809\u20131811|hard fought campaign]] by 1811 and the French threat defeated. In the middle of 1809 the Colonial Governor of India, the [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 1st Earl of Minto|1st Earl of Minto]] wanted to conquer the lucrative Dutch owned [[Spice islands]] famous for nutmeg, mace and cloves. For the EIC the occupation of these islands meant not only a curtailment of Dutch and French trade and power in the East Indies but also an equivalent gain to the company of the rich trade in spice. In 1810 the islands including [[Banda Neira]], [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Ternate]] fell to a [[Invasion of the Spice Islands|British invasion]] with little loss. The following year [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Java fell to the British]] which completed the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. Minto appointed Sir [[Thomas Stamford Raffles]] as lieutenant governor of Java. The British held on to the islands until the end of the war - the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|Anglo-Dutch Treaty]] of 1814 meant that they were handed back to the Dutch. The EIC nevertheless had uprooted a lot of the spice trees for [[Transplanting|transplantation]] throughout the [[British Empire]]. By the 1790s the EIC had established a number of spice gardens in [[Penang]]; by 1815 the gardens had significantly expanded to 13,000 nutmeg trees and as many as 20,000 clove trees.<ref name=\"Milne\">{{cite news |title=Banda, the nutmeg treasure islands |first=Peter |last=Milne |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/01/16/banda-nutmeg-treasure-islands.html |newspaper=Jakarta Post |location=Jakarta |date=16 Jan 2011 |pages=10\u201311 |accessdate=22 Dec 2011 |quote=But the economic importance of the Bandas was only fleeting.

The proceeds of the drug-smugglers landing their cargoes at [[Lintin Island]] were paid into the company's factory at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] and by 1825, most of the money needed to buy tea in China was raised by the illegal opium trade.\n\nThe company established a group of trading settlements centred on the Straits of Malacca called the [[Straits Settlements]] in 1826 to protect its trade route to China and to combat local piracy. The settlements were also used as penal settlements for Indian civilian and military prisoners.\n\nIn 1838 with the amount of smuggled opium entering China approaching 1,400 tons a year, the Chinese imposed a death penalty for opium smuggling and sent a Special Imperial Commissioner, [[Lin Zexu]], to curb smuggling. This resulted in the [[First Opium War]] (1839\u201342). After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the [[Treaty of Nanking]] and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations.<ref name=\"Windle 2012 55\u201374\" /> The Jardines and [[Apcar and Company]] dominated the trade, although [[Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company|P&O]] also tried to take a share.<ref>{{cite book|page=103|last=Harcourt|first=Freda|title=Flagships of Imperialism: The P & O Company and the Politics of Empire from Its Origins to 1867 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HmMLqQXmIkMC&pg=PA103|year=2006|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-1-84779-145-0}}</ref> A [[Second Opium War]] fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the [[Treaty of Tientsin]], which legalised the importation of opium.

The [[Bengal famine of 1770]], in which one-third of the local population died, caused distress in Britain. Military and administrative costs mounted beyond control in British-administered regions in Bengal because of the ensuing drop in labour productivity.\n\nAt the same time, there was commercial stagnation and trade depression throughout Europe. The directors of the company attempted to avert bankruptcy by appealing to Parliament for financial help. This led to the passing of the [[Tea Act]] in 1773, which gave the company greater autonomy in running its trade in the American colonies, and allowed it an exemption from tea import duties which its colonial competitors were required to pay.\n\nWhen the American colonists and tea merchants were told of this Act, they boycotted the company tea. Although the price of tea had dropped because of the Act, it also validated the [[Townshend Acts]], setting the precedent for the king to impose additional taxes in the future. The arrival of tax-exempt Company tea, undercutting the local merchants, triggered the [[Boston Tea Party]] in the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], one of the major events leading up to the [[American Revolution]].\n\n=== Regulating Acts of Parliament ===\n\n==== East India Company Act 1773 ====\nBy the [[Regulating Act of 1773]] (later known as the East India Company Act 1773), the [[Parliament of Great Britain]] imposed a series of administrative and economic reforms; this clearly established Parliament's sovereignty and ultimate control over the company. The Act recognised the company's political functions and clearly established that the \"[[acquisition of sovereignty]] by the subjects of the Crown is on behalf of the Crown and not in its own right\".\n\n[[File:Nawab Mubarak al-Daula of Murshidabad (1770-93) enthroned in durbar.jpg|thumb|Nawab [[Mubarak Ali Khan (Nawab of Bengal)|Mubarak Ali Khan]] with his son in the Nawab's ''[[Durbar (court)|Durbar]]'' with [[British Resident]], Sir [[Sir John D'Oyly, 6th Baronet|John Hadley]]]]\n\nDespite stiff resistance from the East India lobby in Parliament and from the company's shareholders, the Act passed. It introduced substantial governmental control and allowed British India to be formally under the control of the Crown, but leased back to the company at \u00a340,000 for two years. Under the Act's most important provision, a governing Council composed of five members was created in Calcutta. The three members nominated by Parliament and representing the government's interest could, and invariably would, outvote the two Company members. The Council was headed by [[Warren Hastings]], the incumbent governor, who became the first [[governor-general of Bengal]], with an ill-defined authority over the Bombay and Madras Presidencies.<ref>Keay, John (1991). ''The Honourable Company: A History of the English East India Company''. Macmillan Publishing Company, New York p. 385.</ref> His nomination, made by the Court of Directors, would in future be subject to the approval of a [[Council of Four from India|Council of Four]] appointed by the Crown.

British judges and magistrates would also be sent to India to administer the legal system. The governor-general and the council would have complete legislative powers. The company was allowed to maintain its virtual monopoly over trade in exchange for the biennial sum and was obligated to export a minimum quantity of goods yearly to Britain. The costs of administration were to be met by the company. The company initially welcomed these provisions, but the annual burden of the payment contributed to the steady decline of its finances.<ref name=\"Anthony, Frank Pages 18- 19\" />\n\n==== East India Company Act 1784 (Pitt's India Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe East India Company Act 1784 ([[Pitt's India Act]]) had two key aspects:\n* Relationship to the British government: the bill differentiated the East India Company's political functions from its commercial activities. In political matters the East India Company was subordinated to the British government directly. To accomplish this, the Act created a [[India Board|Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India]], usually referred to as the Board of Control. The members of the Board were the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]], and four [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillors]], nominated by the King. The act specified that the Secretary of State \"shall preside at, and be [[President of the Board of Control|President of the said Board]]\".\n* Internal Administration of British India: the bill laid the foundation for the centralised and bureaucratic British administration of India which would reach its peak at the beginning of the 20th century during the governor-generalship of [[George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|George Nathaniel Curzon, 1st Baron Curzon]].\n\nPitt's Act was deemed a failure because it quickly became apparent that the boundaries between government control and the company's powers were nebulous and highly subjective. The government felt obliged to respond to humanitarian calls for better treatment of local peoples in British-occupied territories. [[Edmund Burke]], a former East India Company shareholder and diplomat, was moved to address the situation and introduced a new Regulating Bill in 1783. The bill was defeated amid lobbying by company loyalists and accusations of nepotism in the bill's recommendations for the appointment of councillors.\n\n==== Act of 1786 ====\n[[File:Surrender of Tipu Sultan.jpg|thumb|General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Lord Cornwallis]], receiving two of [[Tipu Sultan]]'s sons as hostages in the year 1793]]\n\nThe Act of 1786 (26 Geo. 3 c. 16) enacted the demand of [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Earl Cornwallis]] that the powers of the governor-general be enlarged to empower him, in special cases, to override the majority of his Council and act on his own special responsibility. The Act enabled the offices of the governor-general and the commander-in-chief to be jointly held by the same official.\n\nThis Act clearly demarcated borders between the Crown and the company. After this point, the company functioned as a regularised subsidiary of the Crown, with greater accountability for its actions and reached a stable stage of expansion and consolidation. Having temporarily achieved a state of truce with the Crown, the company continued to expand its influence to nearby territories through threats and coercive actions. By the middle of the 19th century, the company's rule extended across most of India, [[British rule in Burma|Burma]], [[British Malaya|Malaya]], [[Singapore in the Straits Settlements|Singapore]], and [[British Hong Kong|Hong Kong]], and a fifth of the world's population was under its trading influence. In addition, [[Penang Island]], ceded from the [[Kedah Sultanate]] in Malaya, became the fourth most important settlement, a presidency, of the company's Indian territories.<ref>Langdon, Marcus; [http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ \"Penang: The Fourth Presidency of India 1805\u20131830, Volume One: Ships, Men and Mansions\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703023731/http://arecabooks.com/product/penang-the-fourth-presidency-of-india-vol-1/ |date=3 July 2014 }}, Areca Books, 2013. {{ISBN|978-967-5719-07-3}}</ref>\n\n==== East India Company Act 1793 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe company's charter was renewed for a further 20&nbsp;years by the [[Charter Act of 1793]]. In contrast with the legislative proposals of the previous two decades, the 1793 Act was not a particularly controversial measure, and made only minimal changes to the system of government in India and to British oversight of the company's activities. Sale of liquor was forbidden without licence. It was pointed that the payment of the staff of the board of council should not be made from the Indian revenue.\n\n==== East India Company Act 1813 (Charter Act) ====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n[[File:Major-General the Hon.

The Indian princes had become vassals of the company. But the expense of wars leading to the total control of India strained the company's finances. The company was forced to petition Parliament for assistance. This was the background to the [[Charter Act of 1813]] which, among other things:\n* asserted the sovereignty of the British Crown over the Indian territories held by the company;\n* renewed the charter of the company for a further twenty years, but\n** deprived the company of its Indian trade monopoly except for trade in tea and the trade with China\n** required the company to maintain separate and distinct its commercial and territorial accounts\n* opened India to missionaries\n\n==== Government of India Act 1833 ====\nThe Industrial Revolution in Britain, the consequent search for markets, and the rise of ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic ideology form the background to the [[Saint Helena Act 1833|Government of India Act 1833]] (3 & 4 Will. 4 c. 85). The Act:\n* removed the company's remaining trade monopolies and divested it of all its commercial functions\n* renewed for another twenty years the company's political and administrative authority\n* invested the Board of Control with full power and authority over the company.

The site is now occupied by the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\nIn 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the [[River Thames]] at [[Deptford]]. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at [[Blackwall Yard|Blackwall]]: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.\n\nIn 1803, an Act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the [[East India Docks]]) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the [[West India Docks|West India Dock Company]]. The docks were taken over by the [[Port of London Authority]] in 1909, and closed in 1967.\n\n[[File:Addiscombe Seminary photo c.1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Addiscombe Military Seminary|Addiscombe Seminary]], photographed in ''c''.1859, with cadets in the foreground]]\n\nThe [[East India Company College|East India College]] was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for \"writers\" (i.e. clerks) in the company's service. It was initially located in [[Hertford Castle]], but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at [[Hertford Heath]], Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], now [[Haileybury and Imperial Service College]].\n\nThe [[Addiscombe Military Seminary|East India Company Military Seminary]] was founded in 1809 at [[Addiscombe]], near [[Croydon]], Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company's armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858, and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.\n\nIn 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]], London, a private [[History of psychiatric institutions|lunatic asylum]] run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams. The arrangement outlasted the company itself, continuing until 1870, when the India Office opened its own asylum, the [[Hanwell#Healthcare|Royal India Asylum]], at [[Hanwell]], Middlesex.<ref>Farrington 1976, pp. 125\u2013132.</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Diane K. |last1=Bolton |first2=Patricia E.

Although dissolved by the [[East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873]] following the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|rebellion of 1857]], it stimulated the growth of the [[British Empire]]. Its professionally trained armies rose to dominate the sub-continent and were to become the armies of British India after 1857. It played a key role in introducing English as an official language in India. This also led to [[Macaulayism]] in the Indian subcontinent.\n[[File:Panorama of a durbar procession of Akbar II (Retouched).jpg|thumb|Panorama of a [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] procession of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] Emperor [[Akbar II]], 1806-37. The Emperor is followed by the British Resident.]]\nOnce the East India Company took over Bengal in the [[treaty of Allahabad]] (1765) it collected taxes which it used to further its expansion to the rest of India and did not have to rely on venture capital from London. It returned a high profit to those who risked original money for earlier ventures into Bengal.\n\nDuring the first century of the East India Company's expansion in India, most people in India lived under regional kings or Nawabs. By the late 18th century many Moghuls were weak in comparison to the rapidly expanding Company as it took over cities and land, built railways, roads and bridges. The first railway of 21 mile (33.8&nbsp;km),<ref>Rao, M.A. (1988). ''Indian Railways'', New Delhi: National Book Trust, p.15</ref> known as the [[Great Indian Peninsula Railway]] ran between Bombay (Mumbai) and Tannah (Thane) in 1849. The Company sought quick profits because the financial backers in England took high risks: their money for possible profits or losses through shipwrecks, wars or calamities.\n\nThe increasingly large territory the Company was annexing and collecting taxes was also run by the local Nawabs. In essence, it was a dual administration. Between 1765 and 1772 [[Robert Clive]] gave the responsibility of tax collecting, [[diwani]], to the Indian deputy and judicial and police responsibilities to other Indian deputies. The Company concentrated its new power of collecting revenue and left the responsibilities to the Indian agencies. The East India Company took the beginning steps of British takeover of power in India for centuries to come. In 1772, the Company made [[Warren Hastings]], who had been in India with the Company since 1750, its first governor-general to manage and overview all of the annexed lands. The dual administration system came to an end.\n\nHastings learned Urdu and Persian and took great interest in preserving ancient Sanskrit manuscripts and having them translated into English. He employed many Indians as officials.<ref>{{cite AV media | people=Suijk, Paul (Director) | date=2015 | title=The British East India Company | trans-title = The Great Courses (Episode 24,19:11) | medium=on-line video | location=Brentwood Associates/The Teaching Company Sales.

This is still used in Pakistani and Bangladeshi courts today in civil law. Hastings also annexed lands and kingdoms and enriched himself in the process.

Cornwallis distrusted Indians and replaced Indians with Englishmen. He introduced a system of personal land ownership for Indians.

With the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the canton was changed to the new [[Evolution of UK Flag|Union Flag]]\u2014consisting of an English St George's Cross combined with a Scottish [[Flag of Scotland|St Andrew's cross]]\u2014representing the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. After the [[Acts of Union 1800]] that joined Ireland with Great Britain to form the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], the canton of the East India Company flag was altered accordingly to include a [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]].\n\nThere has been much debate about the number and order of stripes in the field of the flag.

This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, the ''Earl of Mornington'', an East India Company [[packet ship]] of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.\n\nIn addition, the company had its own navy, the [[History of the Indian Navy|Bombay Marine]], equipped with warships such as {{ship|HCS|Grappler|1804|2}}. These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the [[Invasion of Java (1811)|Invasion of Java]].\n\nAt the [[Battle of Pulo Aura]], which was probably the company's most notable naval victory, [[Nathaniel Dance]], Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the {{ship||Warley|1796 ship|2}}, led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, the ''Woodford'', under Captain Charles Lennox, the ''Taunton-Castle'', Captain Edward Studd, ''Canton'', Captain Abel Vyvyan, ''Boddam'', Captain George Palmer, and {{ship||Ocean|1788 EIC ship|2}}, Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral [[Pierre C\u00e9sar Charles de Sercey|de Sercey]] and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen also succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, the ''General Goddard'' played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off [[Saint Helena|St Helena]].\n\n[[East Indiamen]] were large and strongly built and when the [[Royal Navy]] was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys it bought several of them to convert to warships. ''Earl of Mornington'' became HMS ''Drake''.
