The region is Alpine in geography and climate, with forests and meadows dominating the landscape below peaks that reach over 17,000 feet.\n\n{{Weather box\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|location=Naran, Kaghan Valley\n|Jan record high C=11\n|Feb record high C=15\n|Mar record high C=21\n|Apr record high C=30\n|May record high C=35\n|Jun record high C=32\n|Jul record high C=32\n|Aug record high C=32\n|Sep record high C=34\n|Oct record high C=31\n|Nov record high C=19\n|Dec record high C=15\n\n|year record high C= 32\n\n|Jan high C=-0.2\n|Feb high C=3.5\n|Mar high C=8.3\n|Apr high C=14.4\n|May high C=19.4\n|Jun high C=24.6\n|Jul high C=25.2\n|Aug high C=24.3\n|Sep high C=21.7\n|Oct high C=17.4\n|Nov high C=11.6\n|Dec high C=4\n\n|Jan mean C=-2.3\n|Feb mean C=-2\n|Mar mean C=3.3\n|Apr mean C=10\n|May mean C=14.1\n|Jun mean C=18.9\n|Jul mean C=19.8\n|Aug mean C=19.3\n|Sep mean C=16.2\n|Oct mean C=11.9\n|Nov mean C=6.6\n|Dec mean C=1.5\n\n|Jan low C=-6\n|Feb low C=-4\n|Mar low C=0\n|Apr low C=5.6\n|May low C=8.9\n|Jun low C=13.3\n|Jul low C=14.5\n|Aug low C=14.4\n|Sep low C=10.8\n|Oct low C=6.4\n|Nov low C=1.7\n|Dec low C=-4\n\n|Jan record low C=-18\n|Feb record low C=-11\n|Mar record low C=-8\n|Apr record low C=-3\n|May record low C=-2\n|Jun record low C=5\n|Jul record low C=11\n|Aug record low C=11\n|Sep record low C=6\n|Oct record low C=-1\n|Nov record low C=-11\n|Dec record low C=-17\n\n|year record low C = -18\n\n|precipitation colour=green\n|Jan precipitation mm=59\n|Feb precipitation mm=72\n|Mar precipitation mm=94\n|Apr precipitation mm=101\n|May precipitation mm=79\n|Jun precipitation mm=48\n|Jul precipitation mm=102\n|Aug precipitation mm=107\n|Sep precipitation mm=56\n|Oct precipitation mm=37\n|Nov precipitation mm=18\n|Dec precipitation mm=30\n\n|Jan rain days=5\n|Feb rain days=9\n|Mar rain days=10\n|Apr rain days=10\n|May rain days=10\n|Jun rain days=8\n|Jul rain days=8\n|Aug rain days=8\n|Sep rain days=5\n|Oct rain days=5\n|Nov rain days=3\n|Dec rain days=5\n\n|Jan snow days=14\n|Feb snow days=7\n|Mar snow days=10\n|Apr snow days=2\n|May snow days=0\n|Jun snow days=0\n|Jul snow days=0\n|Aug snow days=0\n|Sep snow days=0\n|Oct snow days=0\n|Nov snow days=5\n|Dec snow days=9\n\n|Jan humidity=\n|Feb humidity=\n|Mar humidity=\n|Apr humidity=\n|May humidity=\n|Jun humidity=\n|Jul humidity=\n|Aug humidity=\n|Sep humidity=\n|Oct humidity=\n|Nov humidity=\n|Dec humidity=\n|year humidity=\n\n|Jand sun=\n|Febd sun=\n|Mard sun=\n|Aprd sun=\n|Mayd sun=\n|Jund sun=\n|Juld sun=\n|Augd sun=\n|Sepd sun=\n|Octd sun=\n|Novd sun=\n|Decd sun=\n\n|source 1= Climate-Data.org (altitude: 2409m)<ref name=\"Climate-Data.org\">{{Cite web |url=https://en.climate-data.org/location/199577/ |title=Temperature, Climate graph, Climate table for Naran |publisher=Climate-Data.org |accessdate=2017-08-30 }}</ref>\n\n|source 2= My Weather 2<ref name=\"My Weather 2\">{{cite web|title=Weather|url=http://www.myweather2.com/City-Town/Pakistan/Naran/climate-profile.aspx?month=1|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Saiful Muluk]] Lake\n* [[Lulusar]] Lake\n* [[Dudipatsar]] Lake\n* [[Pyala Lake]]\n{{commons category|Naran}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Populated places in Mansehra District]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]\n", "name_user": "MickelClark", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naran_(town)"}

In ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud is a [[mercenary]] claiming to be formerly of SOLDIER, a group of elite [[supersoldier]]s employed by the [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra Electric Power Company]], a [[megacorporation]] responsible for draining the life from the planet. Fighting against Shinra in the resistance group [[AVALANCHE]], and driven by a feud with the primary [[antagonist]], [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], Cloud learns to accept his troubled past and adapts to his role as a leader.\n\nCloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 [[List of computer-animated films|computer-animated]] sequel film, ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'', in which he fights a new threat to the world while dealing with a seemingly terminal illness. He acts in a supporting role in other ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' titles, and is featured in several other games outside the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. Additionally, he has been featured in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series by Square Enix, and in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series by [[Nintendo]]. Starting ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'', Cloud has been voiced by multiple actors in Japanese and English languages.\n\nCloud was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a character artist for the ''Final Fantasy'' series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. [[Yoshinori Kitase]], director of ''VII'', and [[Kazushige Nojima]], one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After ''VII'', Nomura assumed greater responsibility for Cloud's development, and his design was revised to better conform with the series' shift to a more realistic style.\n\nCloud has garnered a primarily positive reception from critics. Described as iconic, Cloud has been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first [[unreliable narrator]]s, and for the game's depiction of his [[mental disorder]]. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications, and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by ''[[Famitsu]]'', ''[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition|Guinness]]'', and other organizations. His characterization and design have also served as a trope for other characters, most notably [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as [[action figure]]s and jewelry. [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] and [[Cody Christians]]'s English vocal performances were also the subject of praise. \n\n==Concept and creation==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=There wasn't really much controversy or criticism about having him as the hero from within Square, but he is definitely a mysterious character. That's one of the game's main themes, the fact that the protagonist has all these secrets to unravel. He isn't a straightforward hero like [[Superman]]; rather, he has many mysteries, self-doubts, and a real dark side.

In ''Final Fantasy VII'', Cloud is a [[mercenary]] claiming to be formerly of SOLDIER, a group of elite [[supersoldier]]s employed by the [[Gaia (Final Fantasy VII)#Shinra Electric Power Company|Shinra Electric Power Company]], a [[megacorporation]] responsible for draining the life from the planet. Fighting against Shinra in the resistance group [[AVALANCHE]], and driven by a feud with the primary [[antagonist]], [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], Cloud learns to accept his troubled past and adapts to his role as a leader.\n\nCloud reappears as the protagonist in the 2005 [[List of computer-animated films|computer-animated]] sequel film, ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'', in which he fights a new threat to the world while dealing with a seemingly terminal illness. He acts in a supporting role in other ''Compilation of Final Fantasy VII'' titles, and is featured in several other games outside the ''Final Fantasy VII'' continuity. Additionally, he has been featured in the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series by Square Enix, and in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series by [[Nintendo]]. Starting ''[[Ehrgeiz]]'', Cloud has been voiced by multiple actors in Japanese and English languages.\n\nCloud was designed by [[Tetsuya Nomura]], a character artist for the ''Final Fantasy'' series, whose role expanded during the title's development to include supervision over Cloud's personality. [[Yoshinori Kitase]], director of ''VII'', and [[Kazushige Nojima]], one of the game's events planners, developed the story and wanted to create a mysterious character who acted atypically for a hero. After ''VII'', Nomura assumed greater responsibility for Cloud's development, and his design was revised to better conform with the series' shift to a more realistic style.\n\nCloud has garnered a primarily positive reception from critics. Described as iconic, Cloud has been cited favorably as an example of complex character writing in video games, as one of its first [[unreliable narrator]]s, and for the game's depiction of his [[mental disorder]]. He has ranked highly in various character lists compiled by video game publications, and remains popular among fans, continuing to place highly in popularity polls conducted by ''[[Famitsu]]'', ''[[Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition|Guinness]]'', and other organizations. His characterization and design have also served as a trope for other characters, most notably [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]] from ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]''. He has also become the basis for a variety of merchandise, such as [[action figure]]s and jewelry. [[Steve Burton (actor)|Steve Burton]] and [[Cory Christians]]'s English vocal performances were also the subject of praise. \n\n==Concept and creation==\n{{quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=There wasn't really much controversy or criticism about having him as the hero from within Square, but he is definitely a mysterious character. That's one of the game's main themes, the fact that the protagonist has all these secrets to unravel. He isn't a straightforward hero like [[Superman]]; rather, he has many mysteries, self-doubts, and a real dark side.

The Eastern Highlands extend north and south for about {{convert|300|km|mi}} through Zimbabwe's [[Manicaland Province]] and Mozambique's [[Manica Province]].<ref name=\"EnZim\">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia Zimbabwe|publisher=Arlington Business Corporation|location=Worcester|date=1989|edition=2nd|isbn=0-9514505-0-6}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe highlands consist of three main mountain groups \u2013 The Nyanga, Bvumba, and Chimanimani mountains - and several smaller ranges. The mountains are mostly sparsely populated, covered in rich grasslands, shrublands, woodlands and forests.<ref name=\"EnZim\" />\n\nThe [[Nyanga Mountains]] in the north contain Zimbabwe's highest mountain [[Mount Nyangani]] (2,592 m), and [[Mutarazi Falls]], Africa's second-longest waterfall. Zimbabwe's agricultural [[Honde Valley]] lies southeast of the Nyanga range, and leads into Mozambique.\n\n[[Mutare]] is the largest city in the highlands. It is located on the Zimbabwean side of the Mutare Gap, a saddle between the Nyanga and Bvumba mountains. The main east-west road through the highlands is the [[R5 road (Zimbabwe)|A3]] (Zimbabwe) - N6 (Mozambique), which connects the port of [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]] in Mozambique to Zimbabwe's capital [[Harare]] via [[Chimoio]], [[Manica, Mozambique|Manica]], and Mutare, with a border crossing at [[Machipanda]]. The [[Beira\u2013Bulawayo railway]] also crosses the highlands at Machipanda.\n\nThe [[Bvumba Mountains]] are centrally situated south of [[Mutare]]. They lie mostly in Zimbabwe, but a northeastern spur, Monte Vumba, reaches into Mozambique. Agricultural [[Burma Valley]] lies south and east of the Bvumba Mountains. \n\nSouth of Burma Valley, the Tsetsera, Gweni, and Tandara plateaus lie along the border, separated by east-west river valleys lying in fault rifts.<ref>Lister, L.A.

The Chimanimani range consists of a high plateau with several ridges running north and south. [[Monte Binga]] on the border is the highest peak in Mozambique and the second-highest in Zimbabwe. Mussapa Gap is a pass through the mountains that follows the eastward-flowing Mussapa Grande River and westward-flowing Nyanyadzi River. Mussapa Gap was an important trade and migration route through the higlands for centuries.<ref>Ghiurghi, Andrea & Dondeyne, S. & Bannerman, J.. (2010). Chimanimani national reserve: management plan. 10.13140/2.1.1734.6240.</ref>\n\nThe Rusitu-Tanganda fault, an east-west rift that carries the eastward-flowing Rusitu River and the westward flowing Tanganda River, marks the southern end of the Chimanimani Mountains. A hilly upland extends south from the fault into Chipinge District, and the highest point is [[Mount Selinda]] at 1230 meters.<Mapure, Isaac (2012). \"Determinants of vegetation composition and diversity of a moist forest-savanna boundary in south-eastern Zimbabwe\". International Journal of Biodiversity and Conservation Vol. 4(14), pp. 584-591, November, 2012</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Highlands are part of the '''East African Highlands''', one of four distinct physiographic divisions on the African continent. The East African Highlands physiographic division consists of the [[East African Rift]] and [[Ethiopian Highlands|Abyssinian]] physiographic provinces, part of the long chain of mountains that runs down [[East Africa]]. The mountains and mountain ranges that make up the East African Highlands share many common plant and animal species and communities, known as [[Afromontane]] flora and fauna.\n\n==Climate==\nThe Highlands have a more equable climate than Zimbabwe's central plateau, with higher rainfall, low cloud and heavy mists and dew as moisture moves inland from the [[Indian Ocean]]. Many streams and rivers originate in these mountains. The northern portion is drained by tributaries of the  [[Zambezi River]], while the southern portion is drained by tributaries of the [[Save River (Africa)|Save River]].<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\">\"Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic\".

The ecoregion includes the portion of the highlands above 1000 meters elevation, including the Inyangani Mountains, Bvumba Mountains, [[Chimanimani Mountains]], Chipinge Uplands, and the isolated [[Mount Gorongosa]] further east in Mozambique. The [[Southern Miombo woodlands]] ecoregion lies at lower elevations east and west of the highlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nThe highlands have a cooler, moister climate than the surrounding lowlands, which support distinct communities of plants and animals. The ecoregion is home to several plant communities: submontane and montane grasslands, moist evergreen forest, dry montane forest, miombo woodlands, and [[heathland]]s.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\n==Flora==\nMuch of the small area consists of rolling hills covered with grassland, which are renewed annually following the fires that occur at the end of the dry season. At lower elevations, ''[[Themeda triandra]]'' is the predominant grass on the more fertile red soils, and ''[[Loudetia simplex]]'' is common on less-fertile white sandy soils. At higher elevations are montane grasslands made up mostly of short, tufted grasses, including ''[[Loudetia simplex]], [[Trachypogon spicatus]], [[Exotheca abyssinica]],'' and ''[[Monocymbium ceresiiforme]]''.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nSome valleys and east-facing slopes contain areas of tropical rainforest, with a high canopy, [[liana]]s, and a rich undergrowth. There are larger areas of dry forest at higher altitudes in places where the ground is well watered and on drier slopes patches of [[miombo]] woodland ''([[Brachystegia spiciformis]]'', ''[[Brachystegia tamarindoides]]'' and ''[[Uapaca kirkiana]]'') and areas of heathland at higher elevations. There are patches of the tall evergreen Mobola Plum ''[[Parinari curatellifolia]]'' near the town of [[Chipinge]] and on the western slopes of the Nyanga Highlands.\n\nIn the Chimanimani Mountains and [[Mount Gorongosa]], heathlands are found on poor, acidic sandy soils derived from [[quartzite]]. The heathlands are of two types, [[Ericaceae|ericaceous]] and [[proteaceous]]. The ericaceous heathlands are dominated by ''Philippia pallidiflora, P. hexandra, Phylica ericoides, Passerina montana, Erica eylesii, E. pleiotricha, E. gazensis,'' and ''E. johnstoniana. Protea gazensis, P. welwitschii'', and ''[[Leucospermum saxosum]]'' are common in the proteaceous heathlands.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nA number of indigenous monocot lilies with small distribution ranges occur in the highlands. ''Cryptostephanotis vansonii'', ''Cyrtanthus rhodesianus'', and ''Scadoxus pole-evansi'' are popular with rare plant collectors.\n\n==Fauna==\nThis variety of different types of habitat results in a richness of animal life too. Animals found in the highlands include [[blue monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus mitis)'' [[Sykes' monkey]] ''(Cercopithecus albogularis)'', [[East African little collared fruit bat]] ''(Myonycteris relicta)'' and [[Marshall's pygmy chameleon]] ''([[Rhampholeon]] marshalli)''. Many of these animals are found throughout East Africa.<ref>{{WWF ecoregion|id=at1006|name=Eastern Zimbabwe montane forest-grassland mosaic}}</ref>\n\nThe highlands are also rich in birdlife<ref>Ian Sinclair, Birds of Southern Africa, Struik Publishers 1996</ref> including [[trumpeter hornbill]] ''(Bycanistes bucinator)'', [[Knysna turaco]] ''(Tauraco corythaix)'', [[purple-crested turaco]] ''(Tauraco porphyreolophus)'', [[crested guineafowl]] ''(Guttera pucherani)'' and [[crowned eagle]] ''(Stephanoaetus coronatus)''. Two species, the [[Chirinda apalis]] ''(Apalis chirindensis)'' and [[Roberts's warbler]] ''(Oreophilais robertsi)'', are endemic to the Eastern Highlands. The Chirinda apalis lives deep in the evergreen forests, while Roberts's warbler inhabits the forest edge.<ref name=\"worldwildlife.org\"/>\n\nThe forests are also full of butterflies, most notably [[Papilio|swallowtails]] such as the emperor swallowtail ''([[Papilio ophidicephalus]])'' and the citrus swallowtail ''([[Papilio demodocus]])'' and the forest undergrowth in particular shelters a variety of reptiles including [[skink]]s, [[gecko]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[frog]]s, [[toad]]s, and [[snake]]s.\n{{See also|Reptiles and frogs of the Eastern Highlands}}\n\n==Threats and preservation==\nThe mountain forests are vulnerable to logging and the grasslands susceptible to fire and the rainforests, which by definition grow on well-watered fertile land, to clearance for agriculture. The moist climate is ideal for planting tea, coffee and hardwoods. However, much of the original vegetation remains, especially at higher altitudes, which are not suitable for farming. \n\nLarge areas of the highlands are protected, including [[Nyanga National Park]] in the Nyanga Mountains, [[Bunga Forest Botanical Reserve]] in the Bvumba Mountains, and Zimbabwe's 171km<sup>2</sup> [[Chimanimani National Park]] and Mozambique's [[Chimanimani National Reserve]] in the Chimanimani Mountains.

The ceramics used a simple form ornamented with matte enamel using shades of yellow, green, and brown, often with the effect of crystallization. In 1895, he participated in the inaugural exposition of Siegfried Bing's La Maison de l'Art Nouveau, which gave its name to the style.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite book|language=fr|author=Arlette Barr\u00e9-Despond|title=Dictionnaire international des arts appliqu\u00e9s et du design|location=Paris|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions du Regard]]|date=1996|isbn=2-84105-024-6}}</ref>\n\nThe year 1897 marked a turning point. Architectural ceramics were reaching the pinnacle of their popularity and Bigot took the opportunity to found his own company, ''A. Bigot et Cie''. This enterprise, which employed up to 150 workers and counted 10 industrial kilns, produced numerous trinkets, vases and vessels which were on display in his shop, which he transferred in Paris from the rue d'Assas to the rue des Petites-\u00c9curies.\n\nAlong with Emile Muller, Bigot thus became the principal figure in architectural ceramics in France, and from 1898 he worked to integrate ceramics with fa\u00e7ades of reinforced concrete. This architectural outlet explains, by implication, the membership of his company in the Union Syndicale des architetes, but also the relaxation of the urban regulations of 1882 which favored the appearance of projecting elements, such as oriel bays, that broke up the uniformity of fa\u00e7ades.\n\nThe collaboration with [[Hector Guimard]] at the end of the decade marked the beginning of Bigot's fame with architectural ceramics. Before then his work had been confined essentially to baths and restaurants. But in 1898, Guimard's Castel Beranger emerged as the manifesto of Art Nouveau in architecture and its ceramics were commissioned from Bigot, who decorated the fa\u00e7ade with picturesque details and covered the entrance breezeway with highly plastic molded panels designed to evoke the atmosphere of a grotto. The material became thus emblematic of the new style before Art Nouveau's decline about 1910.\n\n==Selected works==\n===Castel B\u00e9ranger, 1894-5===\nArchitect: Hector Guimard\n\n===Paris Exhibition of 1900===\nBigot fabricated Ren\u00e9 Binet\u2019s designs for the main gateway to the Paris Exhibition of 1900.<ref>Madsen 1967, p. 116</ref>  Bigot's work was acquired in its entirety by Jen\u0151 Radisics, the director of the [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Budapest Museum of Applied Arts]] and remained in store until 2013, when much of it was displayed at the Museum.\n\n===Avenue Rapp No. 29, 1901===\nThe [[Lavirotte Building]], designed by Jules Lavirotte, Avenue Rapp no. 29, Paris was the residence of Alexandre Bigot.\n<blockquote>\nIn 1901, Jules Lavirotte\u2019s design for this won a municipal competition as the year\u2019s best.

The ceramics used a simple form ornamented with matte enamel using shades of yellow, green, and brown, often with the effect of crystallization. In 1895, he participated in the inaugural exposition of Siegfried Bing's La Maison de l'Art Nouveau, which gave its name to the style.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite book|language=fr|name=Arlette Barr\u00e9-Despond|title=Dictionnaire international des arts appliqu\u00e9s et du design|location=Paris|publisher=[[\u00c9ditions du Regard]]|date=1996|isbn=2-84105-024-6}}</ref>\n\nThe year 1897 marked a turning point. Architectural ceramics were reaching the pinnacle of their popularity and Bigot took the opportunity to found his own company, ''A. Bigot et Cie''. This enterprise, which employed up to 150 workers and counted 10 industrial kilns, produced numerous trinkets, vases and vessels which were on display in his shop, which he transferred in Paris from the rue d'Assas to the rue des Petites-\u00c9curies.\n\nAlong with Emile Muller, Bigot thus became the principal figure in architectural ceramics in France, and from 1898 he worked to integrate ceramics with fa\u00e7ades of reinforced concrete. This architectural outlet explains, by implication, the membership of his company in the Union Syndicale des architetes, but also the relaxation of the urban regulations of 1882 which favored the appearance of projecting elements, such as oriel bays, that broke up the uniformity of fa\u00e7ades.\n\nThe collaboration with [[Hector Guimard]] at the end of the decade marked the beginning of Bigot's fame with architectural ceramics. Before then his work had been confined essentially to baths and restaurants. But in 1898, Guimard's Castel Beranger emerged as the manifesto of Art Nouveau in architecture and its ceramics were commissioned from Bigot, who decorated the fa\u00e7ade with picturesque details and covered the entrance breezeway with highly plastic molded panels designed to evoke the atmosphere of a grotto. The material became thus emblematic of the new style before Art Nouveau's decline about 1910.\n\n==Selected works==\n===Castel B\u00e9ranger, 1894-5===\nArchitect: Hector Guimard\n\n===Paris Exhibition of 1900===\nBigot fabricated Ren\u00e9 Binet\u2019s designs for the main gateway to the Paris Exhibition of 1900.<ref>Madsen 1967, p. 116</ref>  Bigot's work was acquired in its entirety by Jen\u0151 Radisics, the director of the [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Budapest Museum of Applied Arts]] and remained in store until 2013, when much of it was displayed at the Museum.\n\n===Avenue Rapp No. 29, 1901===\nThe [[Lavirotte Building]], designed by Jules Lavirotte, Avenue Rapp no. 29, Paris was the residence of Alexandre Bigot.\n<blockquote>\nIn 1901, Jules Lavirotte\u2019s design for this won a municipal competition as the year\u2019s best.

The company also achieved recognition as one of the first publishers of dollar fiction. After Farrah & Rinehart acquired the Cosmopolitan Book Corporation from [[William Randolph Hearst]] in 1931, the company began to  publish college textbooks. In 1943, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' awarded Farrah & Rinehart its first [[Carey\u2013Thomas Award]] for publication of the [[Rivers of America Series]] by literary figures.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\n==Rinehart & Co==\n\nAfter Farrah left to start Farrar & Straus (now [[Farrar, Straus, and Giroux]]) in 1946, Farrar & Rinehart changes its name to [[Rinehart & Company]].<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Books\u2014Authors | date=January 1, 1946}}</ref> The new name reflected joint corporate leadership of Rinehart and Frederick Rinehart. During this period, Rinehart & Company achieved recognition for publishing the first books in [[Charles Schulz]]'s [[Peanuts]] series, as well as works by [[Faith Baldwin]], [[Stephen Vincent Benet]], [[Norman Mailer]], and [[Erich Fromm]].<ref name=\"nyt\" /> In 1953, the company published ''The Wonderful World of Insects'' <ref>{{cite book | title=The Wonderful World of Insects | publisher=Rinehart and Company | year=1953 | last=Gaul | first=Albro}}</ref>  as the first book printed by the Photon (known as the Lumitype in France), a photographic type composing machine invented by  [[Ren\u00e9 Alphonse Higonnet]] and [[Louis Moyroud]].<ref name=\"nyt\" /> The Photon machine (known as the Lumitype in France) used a [[photoengraving]] process to print text and images on paper, which made [[hot metal typesetting]] obsolete.\n\nSeven years later, Rinehart & Company merged with [[Henry Holt and Company]] and John C. Winston Co. to form [[Holt, Rinehart, and Winston]] (now the [[Holt McDougal]] Division of [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]). Holt, Rinehart, and Winston named Rinehart and Charles F. Kindt Jr. (president of Winston) as the company's senior vice presidents.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=President Is Elected By Merged Publisher | date=March 4, 1960}}</ref> Rinehart served in that role until retiring in 1963. During his career, he also served as a president of the National Association of Book Publishers.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\n==Military service==\nRinehart enlisted in the [[U.S. Army]] as a private. Rising to the rank of [[lieutenant]], he trained troops in the tactics of [[trench warfare]]. Rinehart later requested a transfer to the front lines to see his mother, who then worked as a wartime [[correspondent]] for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\n==Rescuing motorists on Bronx River Parkway==\nOn April 1, 1940, Rinehart rescued two individuals from a dangerous driving situation on the [[Bronx River Parkway]]. A defective muffler in the car of Fred Lindsey and his wife had begun leaking [[carbon monoxide]] fumes during their drive from [[Scotia, New York]]. After the fumes knocked Lindsey semi-unconscious and his wife fully unconscious, their car began swerving from one side of the Parkway to the other, and it narrowly missed several head-on collisions. Risking a collision himself by driving alongside, Rinehart shouted to Lindsey to turn off the car ignition and steer the car toward the grass shoulder. The shouting aroused Lindsey from his semi-conscious state, which enabled him to do the actions requested by Rinehart. Running to the now halted car, Rinehart pulled Lindsey and his wife to the safety of fresh air. The [[New York State Police]] later drove them to Ossining Hospital.<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Publisher Saves Two from Auto Fumes; Stanley M.

During this period, Rinehart & Company achieved recognition for publishing the first books in [[Charles Schulz]]'s [[Peanuts]] series, as well as works by [[Faith Baldwin]], [[Stephen Vincent Benet]], [[Norman Mailer]], and [[Erich Fromm]].<ref name=\"nyt\" /> In 1953, the company published ''The Wonderful World of Insects'' <ref>{{cite book | title=The Wonderful World of Insects | publisher=Rinehart and Company | year=1953 | last=Gaul | first=Albro}}</ref>  as the first book printed by the Photon (known as the Lumitype in France), a photographic type composing machine invented by  [[Ren\u00e9 Alphonse Higonnet]] and [[Louis Moyroud]].<ref name=\"nyt\" /> The Photon machine (known as the Lumitype in France) used a [[photoengraving process]] to print text and images on paper, which made [[hotel metal typesetting]] obsolete.\n\nSeven years later, Rinehart & Company merged with [[Henry Holt and Company]] and John C. Winston Co. to form [[Holt, Rinehart, and Winston]] (now the [[Holt McDougal]] Division of [[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]). Holt, Rinehart, and Winston named Rinehart and Charles F.

Rising to the rank of [[lieutenant]], he trained troops in the tactics of [[trench warfare]]. Rinehart later requested a transfer to the front lines to see his mother, who then worked as a wartime [[correspondent]] for ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.<ref name=\"nyt\" />\n\n==Rescuing motorists on Bronx River Parkway==\nOn April 1, 1940, Rinehart rescued two individuals from a dangerous driving situation on the [[Bronx River Parkway]]. A defective muffler in the car of Fred Lindsey and his wife had begun leaking [[carbon monoxide]] fumes during their drive from [[Scotia, New York]]. After the fumes knocked Lindsey semi-unconscious and his wife fully unconscious, their car began swerving from one side of the Parkway to the other, and it narrowly missed several head-on collisions. Risking a collision himself by driving alongside, Rinehart shouted to Lindsey to turn off the car ignition and steer the car toward the grass shoulder. The shouting aroused Lindsey from his semi-conscious state, which enabled him to do the actions requested by Rinehart. Running to the now halted car, Rinehart pulled Lindsey and his wife to the safety of fresh air. The [[New York State Police]] later drove them to [[Ossining Hospital]].<ref>{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Publisher Saves Two from Auto Fumes; Stanley M.

He was repeatedly punished for his social-critical writing and spent ten years in severe conditions in jail.\n\n==Life==\nBorn at [[Obersontheim]] in [[Swabia]], he entered the [[University of Erlangen]] in 1758 as a student of [[theology]]. He led a dissolute life, and after two years' stay was summoned home by his parents. After attempting to earn a livelihood as private tutor and as assistant preacher, his musical talents gained him the appointment of organist in [[Geislingen an der Steige]]. Meeting Schubart in [[Ludwigsburg]] in 1772, [[Charles Burney]] called him \"the first, real great [[harpsichord]] player that I had hitherto met with in Germany ... He is formed on the Bach school; but is an enthusiast, and original in genius. Many of his pieces are printed in Holland; they are full of taste and fire. He played on the [[Clavichord]], with great delicacy and expression; his finger is brilliant, and fancy rich.\"<ref>Charles Burney, (1773) ''The Present State of Music in Germany, the Netherlands and United Provinces'', London, T.
