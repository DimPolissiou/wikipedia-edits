On the first round, the group winners qualify to a knockout stage; the winner qualifies to the championship, all other teams, including those eliminated in the group stages, participate in the second round, where the group winners and the runners-up, except for the team with worst record, qualifies to the final tournament. European teams that participated in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup also Qualify to the final tournament. Hosts Ukraine were stripped off the hosting duties, but still were retained by virtue of participating in the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup; instead hosting rights were awarded to four countries: Croatia, France, Germany and Latvia, each hosting a preliminary round group, with France hosting the final round. \n\n====First round====\n{{col-start}}{{col-2}}\n=====Group A=====\n{|class=wikitable

This may stem from Phil's having found a dead clown in the woods when he was a child. Phil appears to love home repair yet never seems to get around to any of the jobs requested by Claire. Throughout season 1, his ongoing project is fixing the step. He at times shows a sort of crush-like affection for Gloria. However, he says he \"would never stray from Claire,\" although Gloria did kiss him during a \"kisscam\" segment at a basketball game in the final episode of season 1, \"[[Family Portrait (Modern Family)|Family Portrait]]\".

Phil is always reminding Jay of when he fixed his wireless printer, trying to show Jay that he can be manly. In the Season 3 episode \"[[Dude Ranch (Modern Family)|Dude Ranch]]\", Phil shows considerable skill both on horseback and with a shotgun.\n\nIn moments of acute adversity or shock in which most people would curse or swear, Phil utters humorous exclamations: references to food such as, \"Sweet Potato Fries!\" or \"Chicken in a basket!\", etc. or he might make a historical reference such as \"[[John Philip Sousa]]!\". It is revealed in \"[[Tableau Vivant (Modern Family)|Tableau Vivant]]\" that Phil had once tried to break up with Claire but didn't have the courage to do so.\n\nA running gag in the show has Phil is running up the stairs (often when carrying an object) and tripping on a loose step, which causes him to quickly and hastily say: \"Gotta fix that step!\"\n\n==== Critical reception ====\nTy Burrell had received many positive reviews for his performance.

At the end of Season 7, Andy is offered a job in his hometown in [[Utah]] and initially turns it down, but Haley encourages him to pursue it, insisting that they will figure out a way to be together. As they say goodbye at the airport, she admits that Andy is the first man she has ever really loved. As of \"[[Weathering Heights]]\", she is dating weatherman Rainer Shine, though they broke up later in the season after he proposed and they both realized they weren't ready. In thirteen episode of season 9, \"In Your Head\", she starts dating Dr. Arvin Fennerman, Alex's [[astrophysics]] teacher at [[Caltech]]. However, a divorced Dylan reappears in the season 10 premiere and confesses he's still in love with her and wants to be worthy of her. They sleep together, and Haley finds herself in love with both men. In the fourth episode of the season, \"Torn Between Two Lovers\", she finally decides Dylan is \"the one\" and breaks up with Arvin.\n\nIn the episode \"Did the Chicken Cross the Road?\", she finds out she is pregnant. In the episode \"Can't Elope\", she marries Dylan.

Characteristically nerdy but still cute nonetheless, Alex is the most intelligent of the three siblings and a polar opposite of Haley. She is very bright and cares much more about her studies than friends/social life and boys.<ref name=\"Alex's bio on ABC\">{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/shows/modern-family/bio/alex/274503 |title=Alex (Ariel Winter) Bio\u2014Modern Family\u2014ABC.com |publisher=Abc.go.com |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=February 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918031044/http://abc.go.com/shows/modern-family/bio/alex/274503 |archivedate=September 18, 2010}}</ref> As the middle child to a shallow big sister and a goofy younger brother, she enjoys messing with them.<ref name=\"Alex's bio on ABC\" /> Often taking advantage of their na\u00efvet\u00e9 by fooling them into believing unrealistic things, she at one time convinced Haley and Luke that they could charge electronics by rubbing the battery on their heads (Haley) and putting it in their mouths (Luke).<ref name=\"Haley's Bio on ABC\" /> She also convinced Luke that he was actually Phil's old girlfriend's son and that Jay was dying.\n\n[[File:Ariel Winter PaleyFest 2015 (16859744400).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|Ariel Winter portrays Alex Dunphy, one of the daughters]]\nAs a stereotypical precocious kid, Alex displays a sense of superiority due to her intelligence, constantly putting her accomplishments on display and demanding recognition for them. An overachiever, she plays the [[cello]]; she chose to play the cello because she would have a better chance at being in a university orchestra than if she played the violin as cellos are more in demand. While she has sometimes felt isolated from her peers (once sadly telling her parents \"I have no friends\"), she has a group of nerdy fans at school who idolize her. Haley sincerely tells Alex at one point she is smart and attractive in a successful effort to get her to give a light-hearted graduation speech instead of a harsh one (it worked well enough that her classmates invited her to a post-ceremony party). At the beginning of Season 3, she was in a long-distance relationship with a boy she met in Wyoming. Later in the season, she went to her prom with a classmate who everyone but himself knows is gay.\n\nIt was established in the episode \"[[Tableau Vivant (Modern Family)|Tableau Vivant]]\" that Alex is a light sleeper, as she was surprisingly energetic when staying awake nearly a whole night thinking about her upcoming art project. The episode \"[[Heart Broken]]\" reveals that Alex suffers from [[hemophobia]]. In the [[First Days (Modern Family)|second episode of Season 5]] onwards, she started wearing new glasses. In Season 6, Alex is currently seeking the best college to enroll in and have a thought about getting away from her family for a while. While Alex was not accepted into [[Harvard University|Harvard]], she was accepted into [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], where she has been attending since the start of Season 7. She had to leave for a little due to getting [[Mononucleosis|mono]]. She was seen to be dating Sanjay Patel until he broke up with her in \"The Closet Case\".\n\nIn season 8, she has a relationship with Ben ([[Joe Mande]]), who works at Pritchett's Closets & Blinds, but later breaks up with him. As of the season 9 episode \"Royal Visit\", she's dating Bill ([[Jimmy Tatro]]), a firefighter who rescued her when she burned a bagel in her room's microwave.

At times, he can be a troublemaker, once shooting his sister with a toy gun and getting into a fight with Manny at school.

A psychologist who evaluated him said his type of behavior was normal for someone with above-average intelligence; afterwards, Phil and Claire accidentally left a wandering Luke behind when they left the psychologist's office, but they ended up being impressed by how calmly he made his way back home (in a limo) and decided he would do just fine in life. Subsequent events have borne this out, as he only got into one college he applied to (and did so because Phil gave up some magic secrets to his former rival-turned-Dean of Admissions) but has become a well-paid social fixture at Jay's country club and shows he can use his connections to help his family. He is frequently seen playing a [[Nintendo 3DS]]. Throughout the series, he is often seen playing with Manny. Often, they do not just play, but develop plans, plots, and ploys. Being that Luke's birthday is November 28, it sometimes coincides with Thanksgiving.<ref name=\"mobile.twitter.com\">{{cite web |url=https://mobile.twitter.com/nolan_gould/status/538390900087746560 |title=Twitter |website=mobile.twitter.com}}</ref><ref>[[Fizbo]]</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Dylan Marshall ===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour           = #f68246\n| portrayer        = [[Reid Ewing]]\n| name             = Dylan Marshall\n| first            = \"[[Pilot (Modern Family)|Pilot]]\"<br />1x01, September 23, 2009\n| last = \"[[Finale (Modern Family)|Finale]]\"<br />11x18, April 8, 2020\n| gender           = Male\n| family           = Mr. Marshall (father) <br /> Farrah Marshall (mother) <br /> Unnamed sibling(s) <br /> 1 unnamed nephew \n| spouse           = {{Marriage|Haley Dunphy|2019-04-10}}\n| children         = Poppy and George\n| relatives        = Phil Dunphy (father-in-law)<br />Claire Dunphy (mother-in-law)<br />Alex Dunphy (sister-in-law)<br />Luke Dunphy (brother-in-law)\n| occupation       = Musician, cowboy (formerly), Disneyland employee (formerly), limo driver (formerly), sign spinner (formerly), T-shirt designer (formerly) <br> Nursing student\n}}\n\n'''Dylan Stardust Marshall''' ([[Reid Ewing]]), sometimes called \"D-Money\" by Phil, is Haley's on-and-off boyfriend (and now the new husband) of Haley Dunphy, introduced as a senior in high school who plays guitar, sings in a band, and has no plans for college. He is often put into awkward situations by Phil, who wishes for the two to be friends.<ref name=\"Haley's Bio on ABC\" /> He has diverse interests that are often surprising such as his love of old [[Western (genre)|western films]]. He also sometimes reveals a sort-of attraction to Claire when he gives her a rose on Valentine's Day saying that \"every mom should look as tasty as you when they're old.\" He also had a dream involving a (suggested) sexual encounter involving himself, Haley, and Claire. Claire strongly dislikes him, to the point of trying to introduce other boys to Haley just so that they break up or don't get back together. He loves the confidence Haley gets from being part of such a loving family and does not mind hanging around during family get-togethers.<ref name=\"Haley's Bio on ABC\" /> He wrote a song for Haley, \"In the Moonlight (Do Me)\", and performed it for her extended family. The song was about sex and most of the family were surprised by the suggestive lyrics, but it became stuck in all of their heads the next day. He finds inspiration for his music from [[Bob Dylan]], [[Sum 41]], [[Blink-182]] and [[New Kids on the Block]].\n\nDylan temporarily leaves the cast to work on a ranch after Haley rejects his marriage proposal in the first episode of season three, \"[[Dude Ranch (Modern Family)|Dude Ranch]]\". In the episode \"[[Virgin Territory (Modern Family)|Virgin Territory]]\", Alex reveals that Haley had lost her virginity to Dylan before they broke up; she told Claire three months earlier, but not Phil. In the episode \"Disneyland,\" Dylan reveals he lost his job on the ranch and moved back to California, taking a job at Disneyland as a [[The Dapper Dans|Dapper Dan]]. He and Haley get back together to Claire's dismay and to Phil's delight. In the season finale, \"Baby on Board\", Haley discovers she was accepted to college. She and Dylan maintain their relationship, and Dylan lives with the Dunphys for a few months. In Season 4, Dylan is invited to move in with Cam and Mitch after his job as a limo driver led him to their Valentine's Day party.  He ends up getting fired and while Cam and Mitch separately tell him he can stick around, Lily angrily tells him he isn't welcome there and shouts at him until he leaves the house. In Season 8, he gets married to a doctor named Elaine Kolchek and has three step-kids much to Haley's dismay as she feels she lost her \"romantic safety net\". Dylan finally married Haley in the season 10 episode \"Can't Elope\", and in the episode \"A Year of Birthdays\", delivered twins, Poppy and George.\n\n== The Pritchett-Delgado family ==\n\n=== Jay Pritchett ===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour     = #f68246\n| name       = Jay Pritchett\n| first = \"[[Pilot (Modern Family)|Pilot]]\"<br />1x01, September 23, 2009\n| last = \"[[Finale (Modern Family)|Finale]]\"<br />11x18, April 8, 2020\n| gender     = Male\n| occupation = Retired business owner\n| portrayer  = [[Ed O'Neill]]\n| family     = Mr. Pritchett (father; deceased)<br />Mrs. Pritchett (mother; deceased)<br />Donnie Pritchett (brother)<br />Becky Pritchett (sister)\n| spouse     = {{Marriage|DeDe Pritchett|1968|2003|end=div}}<ref group=\"note\">In an episode from the second season that aired in 2011, Claire and Mitchell recalled a childhood incident that occurred twenty years prior, and later said that their parents divorced \"twelve years later\".

He is the owner of a closet company and is presumably the wealthiest family member as well occasionally the chieftain of the family in many situations. Jay has a dry and sarcastic sense of humor. Like his son and daughter, Jay is generally more realistic, mild-mannered, and sensible than his partner, Gloria, who is unashamed of the fact Jay is [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|many years her senior]]. A recurring plot involves Jay's relationship with his son Mitchell, which became more complicated due to Jay's reaction to Mitchell's sexual orientation. Humor and plot points are also derived from Jay's relationship with his son-in-law Phil; Jay often mistreats and antagonizes him despite Phil's constant attempts to gain Jay's approval. Nevertheless, Jay thinks very highly of Phil, despite their differences, and said so in Season 3.\n\n[[File:Ed O'Neill at 2015 PaleyFest.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Ed O'Neill]] portrays Jay Pritchett, the father of four, husband of his second wife Gloria.]]\nJay has several masculine character attributes including fondness for sports and model airplanes. Jay is shown also to occasionally be compassionate, showing affection for members of the extended family particularly to Manny, his step-son; their relationship seems to become more positive as the series progresses, eventually becoming a typical father-son relationship. In the finale of the third season, it is revealed that Gloria is pregnant, but Jay does not know yet. In the first episode of the fourth season, Gloria tells Jay and he tells her that it's the greatest news he has heard. The baby was male, which relieved Jay because it says in the episode \"Snip\" that he was afraid of having a girl. Jay is a dog-lover. He sometimes goes overboard in treating his dog Stella as his favorite member of the family much to Gloria's chagrin, and Jay was extremely happy when he realized that Joe was not allergic to Stella, but to Gloria's face cream, in the episode \"Rash Decisions\". Jay is farsighted ([[hyperopia]]). Jay evidently served in the United States Navy during the [[Vietnam War]]. His birthday is April 1, as shown in the episode \"Grill, Interrupted\".\n\n==== Accolades ====\nO'Neill was consecutively nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

However, she does occasionally display some odd parenting techniques. For example, when Manny was first born, she had wanted a daughter, and therefore for the first year of his life dressed him like one and told all her friends he was a girl. She later told Manny (after he found the pictures of himself like this) that the child in question was his \"twin sister who died at the age of one.\" In the sixth episode of Season One, she chastizes Jay for forcing Manny to remove his poncho for school. When they get to the school to return the poncho and realize that Manny has a plan to play folk music to his classmates with his pan flute (which was inside the poncho), Gloria tells Jay to break the flute, saying in her interview that \"the poncho by itself is fine. The poncho, plus the flute, plus the stupid dance? My son will die a virgin.\"\n\nGloria is a terrible driver, though she is oblivious to this. She is also very comfortable with death (on one occasion killing and beheading a rat with a shovel right before she left for [[local church|church]] and leaving the head \"as a warning to the other rats\"), on account of a couple of her relatives being butchers.<ref name=\"Gloria's Bio on ABC\" /> She is an excellent markswoman, often just using one hand and never misses a shot, even saying to Manny that she could have unbuttoned his shirt if she wanted to with her gun (formerly Manny's BB gun). She has a very high tolerance for spicy food, and has perhaps the strongest religious views of any member of the family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} She loves her family and spends a great deal of time with Lily because of her fixation in having a daughter. Mitchell and Cameron asked her and Jay to become guardians of Lily if anything were to happen to them.\n\nGloria has something of a shady past. Doubts have also been raised as to her income: her only mentioned employment was as a hairdresser (and later as a taxi driver), and Claire, Jay's daughter, originally labeled Gloria as a \"gold-digger\" for marrying her wealthy father. It seems likely that Jay is her major source of income. However, in the Season 5 episode \"[[A Hard Jay's Night]]\", the hairshop where she used to work is shown, and it is clarified that Jay is indeed her current major source of income. In the final episode of Season 3, it was revealed that she is pregnant. Her newest son Fulgencio a.k.a. Joe was born in the Season 4 episode \"Party Crasher\". In the episode \"[[Fifteen Percent]]\", she reveals that she comes from a neighborhood of [[Prostitution#Survival sex|prostitutes]] after she said her neighborhood had a saying that \"Love is just around the corner\". The [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]] character of Gloria was based on the character of Angela in the [[Jim Jarmusch]] film ''[[Night on Earth]]'' (1991), played by American actress [[Rosie Perez]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/348237/Yo-Soy-Boricua-Pa-que-Tu-Lo-Sepas-/overview |title=Yo Soy Boricua Pa'que Tu Lo Sepas!

Jay wanted to get rid of her but eventually came around. She is very problematic, and often destroys things, mostly Gloria's belongings.

He was a starting [[Center (American football)|center]] for the [[University of Illinois]] football team (which he and Jay bond over, much to Mitchell's envy) and is a very big sports fan.<ref name=\"Cameron's Bio on ABC\" /> Because of this, he is physically quite imposing, and capable of scaring off anyone who threatens Mitchell. Cameron also fosters many unusual hobbies such as collecting antique fountain pens, being adept in Japanese flower arrangement, and is a classically trained [[Auguste clown]] named Fizbo.<ref name=\"Cameron's Bio on ABC\" /> Cameron prides himself in shooting home films, not movies, and takes that role very seriously. At the beginning of the series he acts as a stay-at-home dad to Lily, though it is mentioned that he had taught music prior to this. In the later seasons Cameron begins working as a football coach. Cameron is also an experienced rock drummer and as a result was brought in at the last minute to play in Dylan's band when they needed a replacement percussionist.\n\n[[File:Eric Stonestreet at 2015 PaleyFest.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|[[Eric Stonestreet]] portrays Cameron Tucker, Mitchell's husband and father of one]]\nIt is also mentioned that Cameron was considerably thinner and in better shape when he first started dating Mitchell. For the first few episodes, his relationship with Mitchell was somewhat strained (as they disagreed on almost everything and showed very different parenting techniques). But in more recent episodes the relationship is much happier.<ref name=\"Cameron's Bio on ABC\" /> Cameron and Mitchell met at one of Pepper Saltzman's \"legendary\" soirees, where during a game of charades, Cameron immediately knew the answer, \"Casablanca,\" based on a subtle gesture Mitchell made with his hands.

In season 5, his music teacher job is eliminated, but he becomes the freshman football coach and physical education teacher. In season 6, he is promoted to varsity coach and his undefeated record and open homosexuality earned him a story on the local television news.\n\n==== Critical reception ====\nEric Stonestreet has received positive reviews for his characters. In a review of the first season, Robert Canning of [[IGN]] named Cameron Tucker the best character of the season saying, \"Cameron's many talents and passions revealed over the course of this first year became an ever-building running gag. But it will be hard to top the sheer joy that was 'Fizbo'.\" He also called Fizbo, the episode and the clown, the highlight of the season.<ref name=\"ign\" /> The reception of Cameron and Mitchell has led to the idea of a spin-off of the two titled ''Mitchell and Cam''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118026163.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 |title='Modern Family' is a 'Cosby' celebre |author=Weisman, Jon |date=October 21, 2010 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Accolades ====\nIn 2010, Eric Stonestreet was nominated for the [[TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy|Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy]].<ref name=\"tca10\">[http://tvcritics.org/2010/the-television-critics-association-announces-2010-tca-awards-nominees/ The Television Critics Association Announces 2010 TCA Awards Nominees | Television Critics Association<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608143141/http://tvcritics.org/2010/the-television-critics-association-announces-2010-tca-awards-nominees/ |date=June 8, 2010 }}</ref> Stonestreet has won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] twice in 2010 and 2012.

Pritchett''' ([[Shelley Long]]) was Claire and Mitchell's mother, Haley, Alex and Luke's maternal grandmother, Lily's adoptive grandmother, Phil and Cam's mother-in-law and Jay's ex-wife. It had been implied that she may be mentally ill due to her somewhat manipulative and sometimes aggressive ways. It is implied that she was initially more accepting of Mitchell's sexual orientation than Jay was when he first [[came out]]. She often uses her close relationship with Mitchell to get him to do things he does not want to do. Jay wanted to divorce her after a spectacular fight they had while their kids were still in school (he taped over an episode of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' to record an [[National Football League|NFL]] game that, ironically, featured the [[Dallas Cowboys]]) but was inspired by [[Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln|an animatronic Abraham Lincoln exhibit]] at [[Disneyland]] to stick things out until Claire and Mitchell reached adulthood. She is still bitter over Jay's remarriage to Gloria and even attempted to ruin their wedding, which she convinced Mitchell to talk Jay and Gloria into inviting her to; she got drunk and made rude and inappropriate toasts and eventually had to be dragged out of the reception, in the process ruining the wedding cake. She is very aggressive towards Gloria, often trying to physically attack her. DeDe is also passive aggressive toward Cameron about his weight, and is often critical of Claire, especially her appearance. She also seems to be very good friends with Manny as they write letters to each other talking about their personal issues. DeDe is also a famous author and poet. A running gag throughout the series is that DeDe's arrival is always forewarned by bad omens, (birds crashing into the window or peaceful scenarios spontaneously turning chaotic).\n\nHer relationship with Gloria improved in the episode \"[[Arrested (Modern Family)|Arrested]].\" When DeDe sees that Gloria is pregnant, she finds it hilarious that Jay's marriage to a much younger [[trophy wife]] has forced him to raise a child in his 60s. She found new sympathy for Gloria, and the two bonded over Jay-bashing when DeDe tells Gloria that she was always the one having to change diapers, clean spit-up, and buy things for the baby. Gloria, in turn, found new sympathy for DeDe, suggesting that her lack of support from Jay was what caused her to become \"so crazy\".\n\nIn the season 10 episode, \"Good Grief\", DeDe was revealed to have passed away peacefully in her sleep, while on a trip with her women's group.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roots |first1=Kimberly |title=Which Modern Family Member Died? |url=https://tvline.com/2018/10/24/modern-family-dede-dies-dead-death-season-10-episode-5-shelley-long-good-grief/ |website=TVLine |accessdate=October 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Frank Dunphy ===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour    = #f68246\n| name      = Frank Dunphy\n| image     = FredWillardApr2011.jpg\n| first     = \"[[Undeck the Halls (Modern Family)|Undeck the Halls]]\"<br />1x10, December 9, 2009\n| last      = \"[[Legacy (Modern Family)|Legacy]]\"<br />11x11, January 15, 2020\n| gender    = Male\n| portrayer = [[Fred Willard]]\n| spouse    = Grace Dunphy ({{Abbrv|d.|died}} 2013)<br />{{Marriage|Lorraine Dunphy|2017}}\n| children  = Phil Dunphy (son)<br />Ray (stepson)\n| relatives = Claire Dunphy (daughter-in-law)<br />Haley Dunphy (granddaughter)<br />Alex Dunphy (granddaughter)<br />Luke Dunphy (grandson)<br />Dylan Marshall (grandson-in-law)<br />George (great-grandson)<br />Poppy (great-granddaughter)\n}}\n\n'''Francis Allen \"Frank\" Dunphy''' ([[Fred Willard]]) is Phil's father and Haley, Alex and Luke's paternal grandfather.

A doctor comes in and tells the family that the stroke may have scrambled some of Becky's memories. She doesn't remember Mitchell coming out as gay and asks Jay if that summer if she could borrow his fishing cabin (It was originally Jay's father's cabin and he had also promised that it would go to Jay, but instead he gave it to Becky, so it's actually hers). Claire sees a necklace which Becky says she got from the prince of Liechtenstein, but in actuality, it is Claire's necklace which Becky stole from Claire when Claire had lent it to Becky for Jay and Gloria's wedding and she never gave it back to Claire. Claire takes the soup to heat it up so maybe the smell would jog her memory.\n\nAt the end, Becky reveals that her brain is fine, that her memories didn't get messed up at all and that the doctor who was tending to her is actually just a guy named Fred who was a friend of hers from next door who played a doctor on a soap opera once and he had kept the coat. Claire and Mitchell come back in and then Claire attempts to fool Becky again to get the necklace back by saying that she got off the phone with the prince of Liechtenstein who said he's been having some financial troubles and that he's gonna need the necklace back to feed his people, but Becky stops her. Jay then reveals to Claire and Mitchell that there was nothing wrong with her memory and that she was messing with them. They are really furious and Claire demands Becky to give her necklace back, but Becky refuses to give it back until Claire fixes the dent she put on Becky's Bonneville car which is still on it and she keeps the necklace when Claire doesn't sound like she denies it. In the ending scene during the credits, Claire is in her car and Phil comes running really quickly. When he gets inside, it is revealed that he gave Becky a hug goodbye, used his sleight-of-hand and on the third try, got the necklace back, which makes Claire really happy.

She begins a fashion blog and goes to community college to study business and photography, eventually showing her photos in an exhibit at which she sells them. In Season 6, she gets a job working for fashion designer Gavin Sinclair as his assistant, doing some of her own design work. In season 9 episode 13, she starts working at lifestyle company Nerp.\n\nThroughout Season 6, Haley develops feelings for Andy (Jay and Gloria's hired nanny) and they begin hanging out often. In the episode \"White Christmas\", Andy and Haley begin a relationship. At the end of Season 7, Andy is offered a job in his hometown in [[Utah]] and initially turns it down, but Haley encourages him to pursue it, insisting that they will figure out a way to be together. As they say goodbye at the airport, she admits that Andy is the first man she has ever really loved. As of \"[[Weathering Heights]]\", she is dating weatherman Rainer Shine, though they broke up later in the season after he proposed and they both realized they weren't ready. In thirteen episode of season 9, \"In Your Head\", she starts dating Dr. Arvin Fennerman, Alex's [[astrophysics]] teacher at [[Caltech]]. However, a divorced Dylan reappears in the season 10 premiere and confesses he's still in love with her and wants to be worthy of her. They sleep together, and Haley finds herself in love with both men. In the fourth episode of the season, \"Torn Between Two Lovers\", she finally decides Dylan is \"the one\" and breaks up with Arvin.\n\nIn the episode \"Did the Chicken Cross the Road?\", she finds out she is pregnant. In the episode \"Can't Elope\", she marries Dylan. In the episode \"A Year of Birthdays\", she gives birth to twins, Poppy and George.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Alex Dunphy ===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour           = #f68246\n| name             = Alex Dunphy\n| first = \"[[Pilot (Modern Family)|Pilot]]\"<br />1x01, September 23, 2009\n| last = \"[[Finale (Modern Family)|Finale]]\"<br />11x18, April 8, 2020\n| gender           = Female\n| family           = Phil Dunphy (father)<br />Claire Dunphy (mother)<br />Haley Dunphy (sister)<br />Luke Dunphy (brother)\n| occupation       = Student\n| portrayer        = [[Ariel Winter]]\n| significant_other = Sanjay Patel (ex-boyfriend)<br />Ben (ex-boyfriend)\n| relatives        = Frank Dunphy (paternal grandfather; deceased)<br />Grace Dunphy (paternal grandmother; deceased)<br />Jay Pritchett (maternal grandfather)<br />DeDe Pritchett (maternal grandmother; deceased)<br />Lorraine Dunphy (paternal step-grandmother)<br />Ray (paternal step-uncle)<br />Gloria Pritchett (maternal step-grandmother)<br />Mitchell Pritchett (maternal uncle)<br />Joe Pritchett (maternal half-uncle)<br />Manny Delgado-Pritchett (maternal step-uncle)<br />Cameron Tucker-Pritchett (maternal uncle by marriage)<br />Lily Tucker-Pritchett (maternal adoptive cousin) Dylan Marshall (brother-in-law)<br />George (nephew)<br />Poppy (niece)\n}}\n\n'''Alexandria Anastasia \"Alex\" Dunphy''' ([[Ariel Winter]]) (born January 14, 1997) begins as the almost 13-year-old daughter of Claire and Phil and turns 16 in season five. Characteristically nerdy but still cute nonetheless, Alex is the most intelligent of the three siblings and a polar opposite of Haley. She is very bright and cares much more about her studies than friends/social life and boys.<ref name=\"Alex's bio on ABC\">{{cite web |url=http://abc.go.com/shows/modern-family/bio/alex/274503 |title=Alex (Ariel Winter) Bio\u2014Modern Family\u2014ABC.com |publisher=Abc.go.com |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=February 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918031044/http://abc.go.com/shows/modern-family/bio/alex/274503 |archivedate=September 18, 2010}}</ref> As the middle child to a shallow big sister and a goofy younger brother, she enjoys messing with them.<ref name=\"Alex's bio on ABC\" /> Often taking advantage of their na\u00efvet\u00e9 by fooling them into believing unrealistic things, she at one time convinced Haley and Luke that they could charge electronics by rubbing the battery on their heads (Haley) and putting it in their mouths (Luke).<ref name=\"Haley's Bio on ABC\" /> She also convinced Luke that he was actually Phil's old girlfriend's son and that Jay was dying.\n\n[[File:Ariel Winter PaleyFest 2015 (16859744400).jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|Ariel Winter portrays Alex Dunphy, one of the daughters]]\nAs a stereotypical precocious kid, Alex displays a sense of superiority due to her intelligence, constantly putting her accomplishments on display and demanding recognition for them. An overachiever, she plays the [[cello]]; she chose to play the cello because she would have a better chance at being in a university orchestra than if she played the violin as cellos are more in demand. While she has sometimes felt isolated from her peers (once sadly telling her parents \"I have no friends\"), she has a group of nerdy fans at school who idolize her. Haley sincerely tells Alex at one point she is smart and attractive in a successful effort to get her to give a light-hearted graduation speech instead of a harsh one (it worked well enough that her classmates invited her to a post-ceremony party). At the beginning of Season 3, she was in a long-distance relationship with a boy she met in Wyoming. Later in the season, she went to her prom with a classmate who everyone but himself knows is gay.\n\nIt was established in the episode \"[[Tableau Vivant (Modern Family)|Tableau Vivant]]\" that Alex is a light sleeper, as she was surprisingly energetic when staying awake nearly a whole night thinking about her upcoming art project. The episode \"[[Heart Broken]]\" reveals that Alex suffers from [[hemophobia]]. In the [[First Days (Modern Family)|second episode of Season 5]] onwards, she started wearing new glasses. In Season 6, Alex is currently seeking the best college to enroll in and have a thought about getting away from her family for a while. While Alex was not accepted into [[Harvard University|Harvard]], she was accepted into [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], where she has been attending since the start of Season 7. She had to leave for a little due to getting [[Mononucleosis|mono]]. She was seen to be dating Sanjay Patel until he broke up with her in \"The Closet Case\".\n\nIn season 8, she has a relationship with Ben ([[Joe Mande]]), who works at Pritchett's Closets & Blinds, but later breaks up with him. As of the season 9 episode \"Royal Visit\", she's dating Bill ([[Jimmy Tatro]]), a firefighter who rescued her when she burned a bagel in her room's microwave.

At times, he can be a troublemaker, once shooting his sister with a toy gun and getting into a fight with Manny at school. Luke is playful, very innocent and does not always understand the repercussions of his actions, like most children; he once announced at a family gathering that his mom thought her dad's new wife was a \"[[gold digger]]\", although he had misheard it as \"coal digger\".<ref name=\"Luke's Bio on ABC\" />\n\n[[File:Nolan Gould at 2015 PaleyFest.jpg|left|thumb|upright=.75|Nolan Gould portrays Lucas Dunphy, the son]]\nLuke is also thought to be rather vacuous because of many questionable actions, such as getting his head stuck in the banister and jumping on the trampoline wearing only underwear and a box on his head.<ref name=\"Luke's Bio on ABC\" /> Both parents agree that they \"dropped the ball\" in regard to raising Luke; Phil once tells Claire that he considers Luke to be their dumbest child (although he conceded to Claire's assertion that Haley was, in fact, dumber than Luke). A psychologist who evaluated him said his type of behavior was normal for someone with above-average intelligence; afterwards, Phil and Claire accidentally left a wandering Luke behind when they left the psychologist's office, but they ended up being impressed by how calmly he made his way back home (in a limo) and decided he would do just fine in life. Subsequent events have borne this out, as he only got into one college he applied to (and did so because Phil gave up some magic secrets to his former rival-turned-Dean of Admissions) but has become a well-paid social fixture at Jay's country club and shows he can use his connections to help his family. He is frequently seen playing a [[Nintendo 3DS]]. Throughout the series, he is often seen playing with Manny. Often, they do not just play, but develop plans, plots, and ploys. Being that Luke's birthday is November 28, it sometimes coincides with Thanksgiving.<ref name=\"mobile.twitter.com\">{{cite web |url=https://mobile.twitter.com/nolan_gould/status/538390900087746560 |title=Twitter |website=mobile.twitter.com}}</ref><ref>[[Fizbo]]</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Dylan Marshall ===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour           = #f68246\n| portrayer        = [[Reid Ewing]]\n| name             = Dylan Marshall\n| first            = \"[[Pilot (Modern Family)|Pilot]]\"<br />1x01, September 23, 2009\n| last = \"[[Finale (Modern Family)|Finale]]\"<br />11x18, April 8, 2020\n| gender           = Male\n| family           = Mr. Marshall (father) <br /> Farrah Marshall (mother) <br /> Unnamed sibling(s) <br /> 1 unnamed nephew \n| spouse           = {{Marriage|Haley Dunphy|2019-04-10}}\n| children         = Poppy and George\n| relatives        = Phil Dunphy (father-in-law)<br />Claire Dunphy (mother-in-law)<br />Alex Dunphy (sister-in-law)<br />Luke Dunphy (brother-in-law)\n| occupation       = Musician, cowboy (formerly), Disneyland employee (formerly), limo driver (formerly), sign spinner (formerly), T-shirt designer (formerly) <br> Nursing student\n}}\n\n'''Dylan Stardust Marshall''' ([[Reid Ewing]]), sometimes called \"D-Money\" by Phil, is Haley's on-and-off boyfriend and now the new husband of Haley Dunphy, a senior in high school who plays guitar and sings in a band and has no plans for college. He is often put into awkward situations by Phil, who wishes for the two to be friends.<ref name=\"Haley's Bio on ABC\" /> He has diverse interests that are often surprising, such as his love of old [[Western (genre)|western films]]. He also sometimes reveals a sort-of attraction to Claire, when he gives her a rose on Valentine's Day, saying that \"every mom should look as tasty as you when they're old.\" He also had a dream involving a (suggested) sexual encounter involving himself, Haley and Claire. Claire strongly dislikes him, to the point of trying to introduce other boys to Haley just so that they break up or don't get back together. He loves the confidence Haley gets from being part of such a loving family and does not mind hanging around during family get togethers.<ref name=\"Haley's Bio on ABC\" /> He wrote a song for Haley, \"In the Moonlight (Do Me)\", and performed it for her extended family. The song was about sex and most of the family were surprised by the suggestive lyrics, but it became stuck in all of their heads the next day. He finds inspiration for his music from [[Bob Dylan]], [[Sum 41]], [[Blink-182]] and [[New Kids on the Block]].\n\nDylan temporarily leaves the cast to work on a ranch after Haley rejects his marriage proposal in the first episode of season three, \"[[Dude Ranch (Modern Family)|Dude Ranch]]\". In the episode \"[[Virgin Territory (Modern Family)|Virgin Territory]]\", Alex reveals that Haley had lost her virginity to Dylan before they broke up; she told Claire three months earlier, but not Phil. In the episode \"Disneyland,\" Dylan reveals he lost his job on the ranch and moved back to California, taking a job at Disneyland as a [[The Dapper Dans|Dapper Dan]]. He and Haley get back together to Claire's dismay and to Phil's delight. In the season finale, \"Baby on Board\", Haley discovers she was accepted to college. She and Dylan maintain their relationship, and Dylan lives with the Dunphys for a few months. In Season 4, Dylan is invited to move in with Cam and Mitch after his job as a limo driver led him to their Valentine's Day party.  He ends up getting fired and while Cam and Mitch separately tell him he can stick around, Lily angrily tells him he isn't welcome there and shouts at him until he leaves the house. In Season 8, he gets married to a doctor named Elaine Kolchek and has three step-kids much to Haley's dismay as she feels she lost her \"romantic safety net\". Dylan finally married Haley in the season 10 episode \"Can't Elope\", and in the episode \"A Year of Birthdays\", delivered twins, Poppy and George.\n\n== The Pritchett-Delgado family ==\n\n=== Jay Pritchett ===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour     = #f68246\n| name       = Jay Pritchett\n| first = \"[[Pilot (Modern Family)|Pilot]]\"<br />1x01, September 23, 2009\n| last = \"[[Finale (Modern Family)|Finale]]\"<br />11x18, April 8, 2020\n| gender     = Male\n| occupation = Retired business owner\n| portrayer  = [[Ed O'Neill]]\n| family     = Mr. Pritchett (father; deceased)<br />Mrs. Pritchett (mother; deceased)<br />Donnie Pritchett (brother)<br />Becky Pritchett (sister)\n| spouse     = {{Marriage|DeDe Pritchett|1968|2003|end=div}}<ref group=\"note\">In an episode from the second season that aired in 2011, Claire and Mitchell recalled a childhood incident that occurred twenty years prior, and later said that their parents divorced \"twelve years later\".

He is the owner of a closet company and is presumably the wealthiest family member as well occasionally the chieftain of the family in many situations. Jay has a dry and sarcastic sense of humor. Like his son and daughter, Jay is generally more realistic, mild-mannered, and sensible than his partner, Gloria, who is unashamed of the fact Jay is [[Age disparity in sexual relationships|many years her senior]]. A recurring plot involves Jay's relationship with his son Mitchell, which became more complicated due to Jay's reaction to Mitchell's sexual orientation. Humor and plot points are also derived from Jay's relationship with his son-in-law Phil; Jay often mistreats and antagonizes him despite Phil's constant attempts to gain Jay's approval. Nevertheless, Jay thinks very highly of Phil, despite their differences, and said so in Season 3.\n\n[[File:Ed O'Neill at 2015 PaleyFest.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Ed O'Neill]] portrays Jay Pritchett, the father of four, husband of his second wife Gloria.]]\nJay has several masculine character attributes including fondness for sports and model airplanes. Jay is shown also to occasionally be compassionate, showing affection for members of the extended family particularly to Manny, his step-son; their relationship seems to become more positive as the series progresses, eventually becoming a typical father-son relationship. In the finale of the third season, it is revealed that Gloria is pregnant, but Jay does not know yet. In the first episode of the fourth season, Gloria tells Jay and he tells her that it's the greatest news he has heard. The baby was male, which relieved Jay because it says in the episode \"Snip\" that he was afraid of having a girl. Jay is a dog-lover. He sometimes goes overboard in treating his dog Stella as his favorite member of the family much to Gloria's chagrin, and Jay was extremely happy when he realized that Joe was not allergic to Stella, but to Gloria's face cream, in the episode \"Rash Decisions\". Jay is farsighted ([[hyperopia]]). Jay evidently served in the United States Navy during the [[Vietnam War]]. His birthday is April 1, as shown in the episode \"Grill, Interrupted\".\n\n==== Accolades ====\nO'Neill was consecutively nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

However, she does occasionally display some odd parenting techniques. For example, when Manny was first born, she had wanted a daughter, and therefore for the first year of his life dressed him like one and told all her friends he was a girl. She later told Manny (after he found the pictures of himself like this) that the child in question was his \"twin sister who died at the age of one.\" In the sixth episode of Season One, she chastizes Jay for forcing Manny to remove his poncho for school. When they get to the school to return the poncho and realize that Manny has a plan to play folk music to his classmates with his pan flute (which was inside the poncho), Gloria tells Jay to break the flute, saying in her interview that \"the poncho by itself is fine. The poncho, plus the flute, plus the stupid dance? My son will die a virgin.\"\n\nGloria is a terrible driver, though she is oblivious to this. She is also very comfortable with death (on one occasion killing and beheading a rat with a shovel right before she left for [[local church|church]] and leaving the head \"as a warning to the other rats\"), on account of a couple of her relatives being butchers.<ref name=\"Gloria's Bio on ABC\" /> She is an excellent markswoman, often just using one hand and never misses a shot, even saying to Manny that she could have unbuttoned his shirt if she wanted to with her gun (formerly Manny's BB gun). She has a very high tolerance for spicy food, and has perhaps the strongest religious views of any member of the family.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} She loves her family and spends a great deal of time with Lily because of her fixation in having a daughter. Mitchell and Cameron asked her and Jay to become guardians of Lily if anything were to happen to them.\n\nGloria has something of a shady past. Doubts have also been raised as to her income: her only mentioned employment was as a hairdresser (and later as a taxi driver), and Claire, Jay's daughter, originally labeled Gloria as a \"gold-digger\" for marrying her wealthy father. It seems likely that Jay is her major source of income. However, in the Season 5 episode \"[[A Hard Jay's Night]]\", the hairshop where she used to work is shown, and it is clarified that Jay is indeed her current major source of income. In the final episode of Season 3, it was revealed that she is pregnant. Her newest son Fulgencio a.k.a. Joe was born in the Season 4 episode \"Party Crasher\". In the episode \"[[Fifteen Percent]]\", she reveals that she comes from a neighborhood of [[Prostitution#Survival sex|prostitutes]] after she said her neighborhood had a saying that \"Love is just around the corner\". The [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]] character of Gloria was based on the character of Angela in the [[Jim Jarmusch]] film ''[[Night on Earth]]'' (1991), played by American actress [[Rosie Perez]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/348237/Yo-Soy-Boricua-Pa-que-Tu-Lo-Sepas-/overview |title=Yo Soy Boricua Pa'que Tu Lo Sepas!

Jay wanted to get rid of her but eventually came around. She is very problematic, and often destroys things, mostly Gloria's belongings.

Cameron acts as a counterbalance to Mitchell's uptight, worrying ways. Because of his mild-mannered, uptight nature, he is sometimes embarrassed by Cameron's flamboyance. He is uncomfortable with public displays of affection, as well as invasion of his personal space. He is an overprotective and cautious father.

He was a starting [[Center (American football)|center]] for the [[University of Illinois]] football team (which he and Jay bond over, much to Mitchell's envy) and is a very big sports fan.<ref name=\"Cameron's Bio on ABC\" /> Because of this, he is physically quite imposing, and capable of scaring off anyone who threatens Mitchell. Cameron also fosters many unusual hobbies such as collecting antique fountain pens, being adept in Japanese flower arrangement, and is a classically trained [[Auguste clown]] named Fizbo.<ref name=\"Cameron's Bio on ABC\" /> Cameron prides himself in shooting home films, not movies, and takes that role very seriously. At the beginning of the series he acts as a stay-at-home dad to Lily, though it is mentioned that he had taught music prior to this. In the later seasons Cameron begins working as a football coach. Cameron is also an experienced rock drummer and as a result was brought in at the last minute to play in Dylan's band when they needed a replacement percussionist.\n\n[[File:Eric Stonestreet at 2015 PaleyFest.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.75|[[Eric Stonestreet]] portrays Cameron Tucker, Mitchell's husband and father of one]]\nIt is also mentioned that Cameron was considerably thinner and in better shape when he first started dating Mitchell. For the first few episodes, his relationship with Mitchell was somewhat strained (as they disagreed on almost everything and showed very different parenting techniques). But in more recent episodes the relationship is much happier.<ref name=\"Cameron's Bio on ABC\" /> Cameron and Mitchell met at one of Pepper Saltzman's \"legendary\" soirees, where during a game of charades, Cameron immediately knew the answer, \"Casablanca,\" based on a subtle gesture Mitchell made with his hands.

In season 5, his music teacher job is eliminated, but he becomes the freshman football coach and physical education teacher. In season 6, he is promoted to varsity coach and his undefeated record and open homosexuality earned him a story on the local television news.\n\n==== Critical reception ====\nEric Stonestreet has received positive reviews for his characters. In a review of the first season, Robert Canning of [[IGN]] named Cameron Tucker the best character of the season saying, \"Cameron's many talents and passions revealed over the course of this first year became an ever-building running gag. But it will be hard to top the sheer joy that was 'Fizbo'.\" He also called Fizbo, the episode and the clown, the highlight of the season.<ref name=\"ign\" /> The reception of Cameron and Mitchell has led to the idea of a spin-off of the two titled ''Mitchell and Cam''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118026163.html?categoryid=14&cs=1 |title='Modern Family' is a 'Cosby' celebre |author=Weisman, Jon |date=October 21, 2010 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Accolades ====\nIn 2010, Eric Stonestreet was nominated for the [[TCA Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy|Television Critics Association Award for Individual Achievement in Comedy]].<ref name=\"tca10\">[http://tvcritics.org/2010/the-television-critics-association-announces-2010-tca-awards-nominees/ The Television Critics Association Announces 2010 TCA Awards Nominees | Television Critics Association<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608143141/http://tvcritics.org/2010/the-television-critics-association-announces-2010-tca-awards-nominees/ |date=June 8, 2010 }}</ref> Stonestreet has won the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series]] twice in 2010 and 2012.

Pritchett''' ([[Shelley Long]]) was Claire and Mitchell's mother, Haley, Alex and Luke's maternal grandmother, Lily's adoptive grandmother, Phil and Cam's mother-in-law and Jay's ex-wife. It had been implied that she may be mentally ill due to her somewhat manipulative and sometimes aggressive ways. It is implied that she was initially more accepting of Mitchell's sexual orientation than Jay was when he first [[came out]]. She often uses her close relationship with Mitchell to get him to do things he does not want to do. Jay wanted to divorce her after a spectacular fight they had while their kids were still in school (he taped over an episode of ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' to record an [[National Football League|NFL]] game that, ironically, featured the [[Dallas Cowboys]]) but was inspired by [[Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln|an animatronic Abraham Lincoln exhibit]] at [[Disneyland]] to stick things out until Claire and Mitchell reached adulthood. She is still bitter over Jay's remarriage to Gloria and even attempted to ruin their wedding, which she convinced Mitchell to talk Jay and Gloria into inviting her to; she got drunk and made rude and inappropriate toasts and eventually had to be dragged out of the reception, in the process ruining the wedding cake. She is very aggressive towards Gloria, often trying to physically attack her. DeDe is also passive aggressive toward Cameron about his weight, and is often critical of Claire, especially her appearance. She also seems to be very good friends with Manny as they write letters to each other talking about their personal issues. DeDe is also a famous author and poet. A running gag throughout the series is that DeDe's arrival is always forewarned by bad omens, (birds crashing into the window or peaceful scenarios spontaneously turning chaotic).\n\nHer relationship with Gloria improved in the episode \"[[Arrested (Modern Family)|Arrested]].\" When DeDe sees that Gloria is pregnant, she finds it hilarious that Jay's marriage to a much younger [[trophy wife]] has forced him to raise a child in his 60s. She found new sympathy for Gloria, and the two bonded over Jay-bashing when DeDe tells Gloria that she was always the one having to change diapers, clean spit-up, and buy things for the baby. Gloria, in turn, found new sympathy for DeDe, suggesting that her lack of support from Jay was what caused her to become \"so crazy\".\n\nIn the season 10 episode, \"Good Grief\", DeDe was revealed to have passed away peacefully in her sleep, while on a trip with her women's group.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Roots |first1=Kimberly |title=Which Modern Family Member Died? |url=https://tvline.com/2018/10/24/modern-family-dede-dies-dead-death-season-10-episode-5-shelley-long-good-grief/ |website=TVLine |accessdate=October 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Frank Dunphy ===\n{{Infobox character\n| colour    = #f68246\n| name      = Frank Dunphy\n| image     = FredWillardApr2011.jpg\n| first     = \"[[Undeck the Halls (Modern Family)|Undeck the Halls]]\"<br />1x10, December 9, 2009\n| last      = \"[[Legacy (Modern Family)|Legacy]]\"<br />11x11, January 15, 2020\n| gender    = Male\n| portrayer = [[Fred Willard]]\n| spouse    = Grace Dunphy ({{Abbrv|d.|died}} 2013)<br />{{Marriage|Lorraine Dunphy|2017}}\n| children  = Phil Dunphy (son)<br />Ray (stepson)\n| relatives = Claire Dunphy (daughter-in-law)<br />Haley Dunphy (granddaughter)<br />Alex Dunphy (granddaughter)<br />Luke Dunphy (grandson)<br />Dylan Marshall (grandson-in-law)<br />George (great-grandson)<br />Poppy (great-granddaughter)\n}}\n\n'''Francis Allen \"Frank\" Dunphy''' ([[Fred Willard]]) is Phil's father and Haley, Alex and Luke's paternal grandfather.

This is clearly mentioned by Claire in \"Closet, You'll Love it !\" when most family members refer to Jay as 'Grump-pa' while Frank is referred to as 'Fun-pa'. His attitude is a near carbon copy of Phil's personality.

Jay, Gloria, Mitchell, Cam, Claire and Phil all go to visit Becky in her room where she is fast asleep with the \"same mean old puss on her face.\" She then wakes up to find her relatives in her room. A doctor comes in and tells the family that the stroke may have scrambled some of Becky's memories. She doesn't remember Mitchell coming out as gay and asks Jay if that summer if she could borrow his fishing cabin (It was originally Jay's father's cabin and he had also promised that it would go to Jay, but instead he gave it to Becky, so it's actually hers). Claire sees a necklace which Becky says she got from the prince of Liechtenstein, but in actuality, it is Claire's necklace which Becky stole from Claire when Claire had lent it to Becky for Jay and Gloria's wedding and she never gave it back to Claire. Claire takes the soup to heat it up so maybe the smell would jog her memory.\n\nAt the end, Becky reveals that her brain is fine, that her memories didn't get messed up at all and that the doctor who was tending to her is actually just a guy named Fred who was a friend of hers from next door who played a doctor on a soap opera once and he had kept the coat. Claire and Mitchell come back in and then Claire attempts to fool Becky again to get the necklace back by saying that she got off the phone with the prince of Liechtenstein who said he's been having some financial troubles and that he's gonna need the necklace back to feed his people, but Becky stops her. Jay then reveals to Claire and Mitchell that there was nothing wrong with her memory and that she was messing with them. They are really furious and Claire demands Becky to give her necklace back, but Becky refuses to give it back until Claire fixes the dent she put on Becky's Bonneville car which is still on it and she keeps the necklace when Claire doesn't sound like she denies it. In the ending scene during the credits, Claire is in her car and Phil comes running really quickly. When he gets inside, it is revealed that he gave Becky a hug goodbye, used his sleight-of-hand and on the third try, got the necklace back, which makes Claire really happy. As they prepare to leave, Claire opens up her camera from behind the car to reveal Becky riding along on her electric scooter telling them to give her the necklace.

Tokat from east, [[Tokat]] and [[Yozgat]] from south, [[\u00c7orum]] from west, [[Samsun]] from north.\n\nThe city of Amasya ({{IPA-tr|a\u02c8masja}}), the '''Amaseia''' or '''Amasia''' of antiquity,<ref name=Brit>\"Amasya\" in ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''. Chicago: [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.]], 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 313.</ref> stands in the mountains above the [[Black Sea]] coast, set apart from the rest of Anatolia in a narrow valley along the banks of the [[Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak (river)|Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak]] River. Although near the Black Sea, this area is high above the coast and has an inland climate, well-suited to growing apples, for which Amasya province, one of the provinces in north-central Anatolia Turkey, is famed. It was the home of the geographer [[Strabo]] and the birthplace of the 15th century scholar and physician [[Amirdovlat Amasiatsi]]. Located in a narrow cleft of the Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak (Iris) river, it has a history of 7,500 years which has left many traces still evident today.\n\nIn antiquity, Amaseia was a fortified city high on the cliffs above the river. It has a long history as a wealthy provincial capital, producing kings and princes, artists, scientists, poets and thinkers, from the kings of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], through [[Strabo]] the geographer, to many generations of the Ottoman imperial dynasty. With its Ottoman-period wooden houses and the tombs of the Pontus kings carved into the cliffs overhead, Amasya is attractive to visitors. In recent years there has been a lot of investment in tourism and more foreign and Turkish tourists visit the city.\n\nDuring the early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, it was customary for young Ottoman princes to be sent to Amasya to govern and gain experience. Amasya was also the birthplace of the [[Ottoman sultans]] [[Murad I]] and [[Selim I]]. It is thus of great importance in terms of Ottoman history. Traditional [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman houses]] near the Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak and the other main historical buildings have been restored; these traditional Yal\u0131boyu houses are now used as cafes, restaurants, pubs and hotels. Behind the Ottoman wooden houses one can see the rock tombs of the Pontic kings.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:\u015eehzadeler \u015fehri Amasya....jpg|thumb|200px|Amasya and [[Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak River]]]]\nAccording to [[Strabo]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] name \u1f08\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 comes from Amasis, the queen of the [[Amazons]], who were said to have lived here. The name has changed little throughout history: \u1f08\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, ''Amaseia'', ''Amassia'' and ''Amasia'' are all found on ancient Greek and Roman coinage and continue to be used in modern Greek. {{lang-hy|\u0531\u0574\u0561\u057d\u056b\u0561}}, [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0627, and modern Turkish ''Amasya'' all represent the same pronunciation.\n\n==Population==\nIn 2012, the permanent population of the city was 91,874. The birth rate of Amasya is low, so its population has been increasing slowly. The population varies seasonally, most people are here during the summer tourist season.\n\n{| border=1 align=right cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 width=200 style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n              \n|-                            \n|  align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|'''Downtown population''' <br />\n|-\n| 2015\n| 101,800\n|-\n| 2014\n| 98,930\n|-\n| 2013\n| 96,670\n|-\n| 2012\n| 91,874\n|-\n| 2011\n| 90,665\n|-\n| 2010\n| 99,900\n|-\n| 2009\n| 86,667\n|-\n| 2008\n| 82,200\n|-                  \n| 2007\n| 85,851\n|-                         \n| 2000\n| 75,393 \n|-\n| 1997\n| 62,668\n|-\n| 1990\n| 57,288\n|-\n| 1985\n| 53,431\n|-\n| 1980\n| 48,066\n|-\n| 1975\n| 41,496\n|-\n| 1970\n| 36,646\n|-\n| 1965\n| 34,168\n|-\n| 1960\n| 28,525\n|-\n| 1955\n| -\n|-\n| 1950\n| 14,470\n|-\n| 1945\n| -\n|-\n| 1940\n| -\n|-\n| 1935\n| 11,981\n|-\n| 1927\n| -\n|-\n| colspan=7 | <small>'''Y & G''' </small>\n|}\n\n== Geography ==\nSituated between the [[Black Sea]] and inner [[Anatolia]] in a region of fertile plains irrigated by the [[Tersakan]], [[\u00c7ekerek]] and [[Ye\u015fil River|Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak]] rivers, Amasya lies in a beautiful narrow river valley, bounded by almost vertical cliffs and the high peaks of the [[Canik]] and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] mountains. Despite the mountainous location, it is not far above sea level. This makes its climate more temperate.\n\nFive bridges cross the river, and most of the town lies on the southern bank, spread along the river. The climb up to the higher ground is very steep, making the valley walls virtually uninhabitable. The town is shaped like the letter 'v' as it follows a sharp bend in the river.\n\n==Settlements in the district==\n===Townships===\n* [[Ayd\u0131nca, Amasya|Ayd\u0131nca]]\n* [[Do\u011fantepe,

[[Hittites]] and subsequently by [[Phrygians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Lydians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], and [[Armenians]].\n\n===Hellenistic period===\nAn independent [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic kingdom]] with its capital at Amaseia was established by the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Mithridatic dynasty]] at the end of the 4th century BC, in the wake of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s conquests.  In the 1st century BC, it briefly contested Rome's hegemony in Anatolia. By 183&nbsp;BC, the city was settled by Hellenistic people, eventually becoming the capital of the kings of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] from 333&nbsp;BC to 26&nbsp;BC. Today, there are prominent ruins including the [[Tombs of the kings of Pontus|royal tombs of Pontus]] in the rocks above the riverbank in the centre of the city. Ancient district in northeastern Anatolia adjoining the Black Sea.\n\n===Roman-Byzantine period===\nAmaseia was captured by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Lucullus]] in 70&nbsp;BC from [[Armenia]] and was quickly made a free city and administrative center of his new province of [[Bithynia]] and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] by [[Pompey]]. By this time, Amaseia was a thriving city, the home of thinkers, writers and poets, and one of them, [[Strabo]], left a full description of Amaseia as it was between 60&nbsp;BC and 19&nbsp;AD. Around 2 or 3 BC, it was incorporated into the Roman province of [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]], in the district of Pontus Galaticus. Around the year 112, the emperor [[Trajan]] designated it a part of the province of [[Cappadocia]].<ref>[[Strabo]] ''[[Geographica]]'', (12.561).</ref><ref name=\"OCD\">{{Citation  | last = Mitchell | first = Stephen  | contribution = Amaseia  | year = 1996  | title = Oxford Classical Dictionary  | editor1-last = Hornblower  | editor1-first = Simon  | editor1-link =Simon Hornblower  | editor2-last = Spawforth  | editor2-first = Anthony  | editor2-link =Anthony Spawforth  | edition = 3rd  | place = Oxford  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | isbn = 978-0-19-521693-6| title-link = Oxford Classical Dictionary }}</ref> Later in the 2nd century it gained the titles '[[metropolis]]' and 'first city'.

At this time it had a predominantly Greek-speaking population.\n\nAmaseia was also referenced in the first book of the [[Alexiad]]. Amaseia was the town where [[Alexios I Komnenos|Emperor Alexios I Komnenos]] received the foreign general Ursel as a captive from the Turkic general Tutach. Ursel had, according to the book, looted and pillaged the Eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire until the at-the-time General Alexios convinced Tutach to capture him. Alexios agreed that he would pay \"...such a sum of money as no one ever gained before.\" to Tutach for the capture of Ursel, however Alexios had no cash to give and the Emperor was unable to fund it, so he attempted to raise money from the people of Amaseia, however this caused serious unrest. However, after a speech by Alexios, he arranged a mock-blinding of Ursel which promptly caused the people to contribute funds.

It was here that Mustafa Kemal made the announcement of the [[Turkish War of Independence]] in the [[Amasya Circular]]. This circular is considered as the first written document putting the Turkish War of Independence in motion. The circular, distributed across Anatolia, declared Turkey's independence and integrity to be in danger and called for a national conference to be held in [[Sivas]] ([[Sivas Congress]]) and before that, for a preparatory congress comprising representatives from the eastern provinces of Anatolia to be held in [[Erzurum]] in July ([[Erzurum Congress]]).\n\nDuring the years of [[World War I]] and the [[Turkish War of Independence]], the Christian inhabitants of Amasya (Armenian and Greek) suffered from atrocities. Many Armenian civilians fleeing the attacks sought refuge at the American missionary school [[Anatolia College]], located in [[Merzifon]] outside Amasya. In 1921, Turkish troops closed down the school, and the local population relocated to [[Thessaloniki]] after the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].<ref>Carl C.

The nearby mountain ''Ferhat'' is named for [[Farhad]] (Turkish spelling Ferhat), the hero of the legend, who for love of the princess [[Shirin]] (Turkish spelling \u015eirin) tried to win her father's favour and permission by tunnelling through the mountain to bring spring water to his palace. Sadly, while he was working he was sent the false information that Shirin had died; upon which he threw himself onto the rocks in his grief. And his beloved princess died soon after.\nThe story has since become a play by [[N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet]], a novel by [[Talip Apayd\u0131n]], and an opera by [[Arif Melikov]].\n\n== Climate ==\nAmasya has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] (Csa) under [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] classification and a hot summer oceanic climate (Doa) under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] classification. Also, Amasya is warmer than central Anatolia, and its weather is not as cold in winter months. It has a transitional climate between the oceanic climate of the Black Sea and a continental and Mediterranean climate. However, this narrow valley causes Amasya to have a temperate climate. This effect is due to the Ye\u015filirmak river that moderates its climate.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Amasya (1950 - 2014)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C= 21.3\n| Feb record high C= 24.8\n| Mar record high C= 31.2\n| Apr record high C= 35.8\n| May record high C= 37.5\n| Jun record high C= 41.8\n| Jul record high C= 45.0\n| Aug record high C= 42.2\n| Sep record high C= 40.3\n| Oct record high C= 36.0\n| Nov record high C= 29.7\n| Dec record high C= 22.9\n| Jan high C = 6.9\n| Feb high C = 9.5\n| Mar high C = 14.4\n| Apr high C = 20.2\n| May high C = 24.9\n| Jun high C = 28.6\n| Jul high C = 31.0\n| Aug high C = 31.3\n| Sep high C = 27.6\n| Oct high C = 21.7\n| Nov high C = 14.4\n| Dec high C = 8.7\n| Jan mean C = 2.7\n| Feb mean C = 4.5\n| Mar mean C = 8.4\n| Apr mean C = 13.6\n| May mean C = 17.9\n| Jun mean C = 21.6\n| Jul mean C = 24.1\n| Aug mean C = 24.0\n| Sep mean C = 20.0\n| Oct mean C = 14.6\n| Nov mean C = 8.6\n| Dec mean C = 4.7\n| Jan low C = -0.9\n| Feb low C = 0.1\n| Mar low C = 3.0\n| Apr low C = 7.2\n| May low C = 11.0\n| Jun low C = 14.3\n| Jul low C = 16.6\n| Aug low C = 16.5\n| Sep low C = 12.7\n| Oct low C = 8.5\n| Nov low C = 3.8\n| Dec low C = 1.2\n| Jan record low C= -21.0\n| Feb record low C= -20.4\n| Mar record low C= -15.3\n| Apr record low C= -5.1\n| May record low C= -0.1\n| Jun record low C= 4.8\n| Jul record low C= 8.5\n| Aug record low C= 8.8\n| Sep record low C= 3.0\n| Oct record low C= -2.9\n| Nov record low C= -9.5\n| Dec record low C= -12.7\n| Jan precipitation mm = 48.4\n| Feb precipitation mm = 38.0\n| Mar precipitation mm = 46.6\n| Apr precipitation mm = 56.8\n| May precipitation mm = 51.4\n| Jun precipitation mm = 36.9\n| Jul precipitation mm = 14.9\n| Aug precipitation mm = 9.1\n| Sep precipitation mm = 20.6\n| Oct precipitation mm = 35.7\n| Nov precipitation mm = 45.2\n| Dec precipitation mm = 55.4\n| Jan precipitation days= 12.1\n| Feb precipitation days= 11.0\n| Mar precipitation days= 12.5\n| Apr precipitation days= 13.3\n| May precipitation days= 12.7\n| Jun precipitation days= 8.7\n| Jul precipitation days= 3.3\n| Aug precipitation days= 2.6\n| Sep precipitation days= 4.8\n| Oct precipitation days= 8.0\n| Nov precipitation days= 9.5\n| Dec precipitation days= 12.6\n|Jand sun= 2.1\n|Febd sun= 3.1\n|Mard sun= 4.3\n|Aprd sun= 5.5\n| Mayd sun= 7.3\n|Jund sun= 9.0\n|Juld sun= 9.5\n|Augd sun= 9.2\n|Sepd sun= 7.4\n|Octd sun= 5.6\n|Novd sun= 3.1\n|Decd sun= 2.6\n|source 1 = [[Turkish State Meteorological Service]]<ref name=eather1>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.mgm.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?m=AMASYA | title = Meteoroloji | accessdate = 8 January 2016\n| publisher = | language = Turkish}}</ref>\n|date=January 2016\n}}\n\n== Amasya today ==\nThe province of Amasya is known for producing high-quality, small, well-flavoured apples. The Amasya-Tokat region the main area of production. The city is not so developed industrial terms, but is attractive and well-preserved, especially when sitting by the river, which has a particular mystique on a winter evening when fog fills the valley. Tourists (and soldiers from the local base) contribute valuable income to the shopkeepers. The railway line from [[Sivas]] to [[Samsun]] runs through Amasya, and there is an attractive Ottoman-era railway station.\n\nThe city of Amasya has some nightlife, mainly bars and cafes for visitors, and some basic restaurants. It is not a very conservative city, unlike other central and eastern Anatolian cities. Social life in this city, partly owing to tourism, becomes more animated especially during the summer period. Many international circus groups visit this city. June 12 is a festival date for Amasya during this time, with many cultural and sporting activities on offer.\n\nThe local cuisine includes the local specialty ''toyga \u00e7orbas\u0131'', a soup containing [[yogurt]], drunk hot or cold. Other specialties include pastries with poppy seeds and tea, served by the riverbank.\n\nThere is an airport in the district, open for civilian flights since 2008. Previously, it was used only for military purposes. There are daily one-hour flights from/to [[Istanbul]].\n[[File:Amasya-Panorama1.jpg|1000px|center|thumb|<center>Panorama of Amasya</center>]]\n\n=== Tourism ===\n[[File:Ferhat ile \u015eirin, Amasya.jpg|thumb|right|\"Ferhat and \u015eirin\" statue.]]\nTourism has been increasing.

Foreign tourists are mostly Germans and East Asians, notably Japan and South Korea. In consequence, many hotels, especially boutique hotels, are opening. Many traditional Ottoman wooden houses have been restored and are now used as boutique hotels, cafes, bars.\n\nThe ruins of the citadel on the rock face of the cleft shelters 2000-year-old water-channels, 1000-year-old bridges, a mental hospital, an Ottoman Pontus kings, which contribute very much to the attractiveness of the city. At night, when they are illuminated, the view is unforgettable. Palace and a secret underground passageway. On the rock faces there are impressive rock tombs.\nThe city also has many historically and architecturally precious buildings; the Ferhat water channel, the 13th century Seljuk Burmali Mosque, the 15th century Yildirim Beyazit Mosque and Complex; the 14th century Ilhanli Bimarhane Mental Hospital with lovely relieves around its portal, the extraordinary octagonal Kapi Aga Medrese (theological school), the Torumtay Mausoleum and the G\u00f6k Medrese. There are traditional Turkish mansions which have been well-preserved showing the best examples of [[Architecture of Turkey|Turkish architecture]]. The 19th century Hazeranlar Mansion has been restored perfectly and now it is of great interest with an art gallery on its first floor and an ethnographical museum on the second. The [[Archaeological Museum of Amasya]] has an interesting collection including the mummies of the [[Ilkhanate|Ilhanli rulers]] of Amasya.\n[[File:Tombs of the kings of Pontus at night in Amsaya, Turkey.JPG|thumb|right|Tombs of the kings of Pontus]]\n\n* On the rock of Har\u015fena above the town is the terraced site of the royal palace and the tombs of the kings of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] (illuminated at night) which, although not kept in the best condition, are an impressive sight from the town. There are five unit tombs placed at slope of Amasya Castle that all are engraved on the limestone rocks. They extend like a straight wall with the construction and location properties they take attention at the first sight. Their surroundings engraved until they completely separated from the main rock, than they reunite to the main rock with stairs There are some ones large and some ones small totally 18 rock tomb units present The famous geographer Strabon (BC 63 - AC 5) whom born at Amasya, delivers an information that Rock tombs was belonged to Pontus Kings.\n* Aynal\u0131 Cave (Rock Tomb) is approximately three kilometres away from city centre, and on the way of Ziyaret district which way separated to the right from surrounding high way towards Samsun It is the best- decorated and completed tomb among other King Rock Tombs. At the vault section there are six pictures on each right and left walls, which figure out 12 disciple And there are some figures that include men and women on the west and east walls, although there is a composition figure contains the Jesus, the Virgin Mary and Disciple on east wall.\n* ''Harsene Kalesi'' \u2013 A fortification, mentioned by Strabo and largely rebuilt in medieval times also lies in ruins on a rocky outcrop above the town. And in the district of Nerkis lies some remainsN of another castle, ''Enderun Kalesi''. It is placed on precious rocks named Har\u015fane Mountain at the west of Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak river and the city centre. There are four main gates in the castle, which are named Belk\u0131s, Saray (palace), Maydonos, and Meydan (Public Square). There is a water well named Cilanbolu in castle too, moreover water hole and dungeon present in castle A laddered under ground way from the castle that reach to 70 meter below river towards the kings tombs dated to the 3rd century BC.\n* The town itself has many historically and architecturally valuable buildings, including the Ferhat aqueduct, the 13th century Seljuk Burmali Mosque, the 14th century [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhan]] ''Bimarhane'' Mental Hospital with lovely reliefs around its portal, the tomb of 15th century scholar [[Pir Ilyas]] and the 15th-century mosque of Yildirim Beyazit. Unfortunately, Amasya is vulnerable to earthquakes which have damaged many monuments (most recently in 1939).\n* There are a number of well-preserved traditional Ottoman Turkish mansions, some of the best examples of Turkish domestic architecture.

({{lang-el|\u1f08\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1}}) is a city in northern [[Turkey]] and is the capital of [[Amasya Province]], in the [[Black Sea Region]]. Tokat from east, [[Tokat]] and [[Yozgat]] from south, [[\u00c7orum]] from west, [[Samsun]] from north.\n\nThe city of Amasya ({{IPA-tr|a\u02c8masja}}), the '''Amaseia''' or '''Amasia''' of antiquity,<ref name=Brit>\"Amasya\" in ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''. Chicago: [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Inc.]], 15th edn., 1992, Vol. 1, p. 313.</ref> stands in the mountains above the [[Black Sea]] coast, set apart from the rest of Anatolia in a narrow valley along the banks of the [[Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak (river)|Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak]] River. Although near the Black Sea, this area is high above the coast and has an inland climate, well-suited to growing apples, for which Amasya province, one of the provinces in north-central Anatolia Turkey, is famed. It was the home of the geographer [[Strabo]] and the birthplace of the 15th century scholar and physician [[Amirdovlat Amasiatsi]]. Located in a narrow cleft of the Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak (Iris) river, it has a history of 7,500 years which has left many traces still evident today.\n\nIn antiquity, Amaseia was a fortified city high on the cliffs above the river. It has a long history as a wealthy provincial capital, producing kings and princes, artists, scientists, poets and thinkers, from the kings of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], through [[Strabo]] the geographer, to many generations of the Ottoman imperial dynasty. With its Ottoman-period wooden houses and the tombs of the Pontus kings carved into the cliffs overhead, Amasya is attractive to visitors. In recent years there has been a lot of investment in tourism and more foreign and Turkish tourists visit the city.\n\nDuring the early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule, it was customary for young Ottoman princes to be sent to Amasya to govern and gain experience. Amasya was also the birthplace of the [[Ottoman sultans]] [[Murad I]] and [[Selim I]]. It is thus of great importance in terms of Ottoman history. Traditional [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman houses]] near the Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak and the other main historical buildings have been restored; these traditional Yal\u0131boyu houses are now used as cafes, restaurants, pubs and hotels. Behind the Ottoman wooden houses one can see the rock tombs of the Pontic kings.\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:\u015eehzadeler \u015fehri Amasya....jpg|thumb|200px|Amasya and [[Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak River]]]]\nAccording to [[Strabo]] the [[Greek language|Greek]] name \u1f08\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 comes from Amasis, the queen of the [[Amazons]], who were said to have lived here. The name has changed little throughout history: \u1f08\u03bc\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, ''Amaseia'', ''Amassia'' and ''Amasia'' are all found on ancient Greek and Roman coinage and continue to be used in modern Greek. {{lang-hy|\u0531\u0574\u0561\u057d\u056b\u0561}}, [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] \u0623\u0645\u0627\u0635\u064a\u0627, and modern Turkish ''Amasya'' all represent the same pronunciation.\n\n==Population==\nIn 2012, the permanent population of the city was 91,874. The birth rate of Amasya is low, so its population has been increasing slowly. The population varies seasonally, most people are here during the summer tourist season.\n\n{| border=1 align=right cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 width=200 style=\"margin: 0 0 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n              \n|-                            \n|  align=\"center\" colspan=\"2\"|'''Downtown population''' <br />\n|-\n| 2015\n| 101,800\n|-\n| 2014\n| 98,930\n|-\n| 2013\n| 96,670\n|-\n| 2012\n| 91,874\n|-\n| 2011\n| 90,665\n|-\n| 2010\n| 99,900\n|-\n| 2009\n| 86,667\n|-\n| 2008\n| 82,200\n|-                  \n| 2007\n| 85,851\n|-                         \n| 2000\n| 75,393 \n|-\n| 1997\n| 62,668\n|-\n| 1990\n| 57,288\n|-\n| 1985\n| 53,431\n|-\n| 1980\n| 48,066\n|-\n| 1975\n| 41,496\n|-\n| 1970\n| 36,646\n|-\n| 1965\n| 34,168\n|-\n| 1960\n| 28,525\n|-\n| 1955\n| -\n|-\n| 1950\n| 14,470\n|-\n| 1945\n| -\n|-\n| 1940\n| -\n|-\n| 1935\n| 11,981\n|-\n| 1927\n| -\n|-\n| colspan=7 | <small>'''Y & G''' </small>\n|}\n\n== Geography ==\nSituated between the [[Black Sea]] and inner [[Anatolia]] in a region of fertile plains irrigated by the [[Tersakan]], [[\u00c7ekerek]] and [[Ye\u015fil River|Ye\u015fil\u0131rmak]] rivers, Amasya lies in a beautiful narrow river valley, bounded by almost vertical cliffs and the high peaks of the [[Canik]] and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] mountains. Despite the mountainous location, it is not far above sea level. This makes its climate more temperate.\n\nFive bridges cross the river, and most of the town lies on the southern bank, spread along the river. The climb up to the higher ground is very steep, making the valley walls virtually uninhabitable. The town is shaped like the letter 'v' as it follows a sharp bend in the river.\n\n==Settlements in the district==\n===Townships===\n* [[Ayd\u0131nca, Amasya|Ayd\u0131nca]]\n* [[Do\u011fantepe,

[[Hittites]] and subsequently by [[Phrygians]], [[Cimmerians]], [[Lydians]], [[Persian people|Persians]], and [[Armenians]].\n\n===Hellenistic period===\nAn independent [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic kingdom]] with its capital at Amaseia was established by the [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Mithridatic dynasty]] at the end of the 4th century BC, in the wake of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s conquests.  In the 1st century BC, it briefly contested Rome's hegemony in Anatolia. By 183&nbsp;BC, the city was settled by Hellenistic people, eventually becoming the capital of the kings of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] from 333&nbsp;BC to 26&nbsp;BC. Today, there are prominent ruins including the [[Tombs of the kings of Pontus|royal tombs of Pontus]] in the rocks above the riverbank in the centre of the city. Ancient district in northeastern Anatolia adjoining the Black Sea.\n\n===Roman-Byzantine period===\nAmaseia was captured by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Lucullus]] in 70&nbsp;BC from [[Armenia]] and was quickly made a free city and administrative center of his new province of [[Bithynia]] and [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]] by [[Pompey]]. By this time, Amaseia was a thriving city, the home of thinkers, writers and poets, and one of them, [[Strabo]], left a full description of Amaseia as it was between 60&nbsp;BC and 19&nbsp;AD. Around 2 or 3 BC, it was incorporated into the Roman province of [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]], in the district of Pontus Galaticus. Around the year 112, the emperor [[Trajan]] designated it a part of the province of [[Cappadocia]].<ref>[[Strabo]] ''[[Geographica]]'', (12.561).</ref><ref name=\"OCD\">{{Citation  | last = Mitchell | first = Stephen  | contribution = Amaseia  | year = 1996  | title = Oxford Classical Dictionary  | editor1-last = Hornblower  | editor1-first = Simon  | editor1-link =Simon Hornblower  | editor2-last = Spawforth  | editor2-first = Anthony  | editor2-link =Anthony Spawforth  | edition = 3rd  | place = Oxford  | publisher = Oxford University Press  | isbn = 978-0-19-521693-6| title-link = Oxford Classical Dictionary }}</ref> Later in the 2nd century it gained the titles '[[metropolis]]' and 'first city'.

At this time it had a predominantly Greek-speaking population.\n\nAmaseia was also referenced in the first book of the [[Alexiad]]. Amaseia was the town where [[Alexios I Komnenos|Emperor Alexios I Komnenos]] received the foreign general Ursel as a captive from the Turkic general Tutach. Ursel had, according to the book, looted and pillaged the Eastern provinces of the Byzantine Empire until the at-the-time General Alexios convinced Tutach to capture him. Alexios agreed that he would pay \"...such a sum of money as no one ever gained before.\" to Tutach for the capture of Ursel, however Alexios had no cash to give and the Emperor was unable to fund it, so he attempted to raise money from the people of Amaseia, however this caused serious unrest. However, after a speech by Alexios, he arranged a mock-blinding of Ursel which promptly caused the people to contribute funds.

This effect is due to the Ye\u015filirmak river that moderates its climate.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Amasya (1950 - 2014)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C= 21.3\n| Feb record high C= 24.8\n| Mar record high C= 31.2\n| Apr record high C= 35.8\n| May record high C= 37.5\n| Jun record high C= 41.8\n| Jul record high C= 45.0\n| Aug record high C= 42.2\n| Sep record high C= 40.3\n| Oct record high C= 36.0\n| Nov record high C= 29.7\n| Dec record high C= 22.9\n| Jan high C = 6.9\n| Feb high C = 9.5\n| Mar high C = 14.4\n| Apr high C = 20.2\n| May high C = 24.9\n| Jun high C = 28.6\n| Jul high C = 31.0\n| Aug high C = 31.3\n| Sep high C = 27.6\n| Oct high C = 21.7\n| Nov high C = 14.4\n| Dec high C = 8.7\n| Jan mean C = 2.7\n| Feb mean C = 4.5\n| Mar mean C = 8.4\n| Apr mean C = 13.6\n| May mean C = 17.9\n| Jun mean C = 21.6\n| Jul mean C = 24.1\n| Aug mean C = 24.0\n| Sep mean C = 20.0\n| Oct mean C = 14.6\n| Nov mean C = 8.6\n| Dec mean C = 4.7\n| Jan low C = -0.9\n| Feb low C = 0.1\n| Mar low C = 3.0\n| Apr low C = 7.2\n| May low C = 11.0\n| Jun low C = 14.3\n| Jul low C = 16.6\n| Aug low C = 16.5\n| Sep low C = 12.7\n| Oct low C = 8.5\n| Nov low C = 3.8\n| Dec low C = 1.2\n| Jan record low C= -21.0\n| Feb record low C= -20.4\n| Mar record low C= -15.3\n| Apr record low C= -5.1\n| May record low C= -0.1\n| Jun record low C= 4.8\n| Jul record low C= 8.5\n| Aug record low C= 8.8\n| Sep record low C= 3.0\n| Oct record low C= -2.9\n| Nov record low C= -9.5\n| Dec record low C= -12.7\n| Jan precipitation mm = 48.4\n| Feb precipitation mm = 38.0\n| Mar precipitation mm = 46.6\n| Apr precipitation mm = 56.8\n| May precipitation mm = 51.4\n| Jun precipitation mm = 36.9\n| Jul precipitation mm = 14.9\n| Aug precipitation mm = 9.1\n| Sep precipitation mm = 20.6\n| Oct precipitation mm = 35.7\n| Nov precipitation mm = 45.2\n| Dec precipitation mm = 55.4\n| Jan precipitation days= 12.1\n| Feb precipitation days= 11.0\n| Mar precipitation days= 12.5\n| Apr precipitation days= 13.3\n| May precipitation days= 12.7\n| Jun precipitation days= 8.7\n| Jul precipitation days= 3.3\n| Aug precipitation days= 2.6\n| Sep precipitation days= 4.8\n| Oct precipitation days= 8.0\n| Nov precipitation days= 9.5\n| Dec precipitation days= 12.6\n|Jand sun= 2.1\n|Febd sun= 3.1\n|Mard sun= 4.3\n|Aprd sun= 5.5\n| Mayd sun= 7.3\n|Jund sun= 9.0\n|Juld sun= 9.5\n|Augd sun= 9.2\n|Sepd sun= 7.4\n|Octd sun= 5.6\n|Novd sun= 3.1\n|Decd sun= 2.6\n|source 1 = [[Turkish State Meteorological Service]]<ref name=eather1>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.mgm.gov.tr/veridegerlendirme/il-ve-ilceler-istatistik.aspx?m=AMASYA | title = Meteoroloji | accessdate = 8 January 2016\n| publisher = | language = Turkish}}</ref>\n|date=January 2016\n}}\n\n== Amasya today ==\nThe province of Amasya is known for producing high-quality, small, well-flavoured apples.

The treatment, during which Candace was suffocated, included a rebirthing script.\n\n==History==\nCandace was born in [[Lincolnton, North Carolina]], to Angela and Todd Elmore. At a young age, she and her younger brother Michael and sister Chelsea were removed from the home for neglect and separated by [[social services]]. When she was five, her parents' parental rights were terminated. Two years later she was adopted by Jeane Elizabeth Newmaker, a single woman and [[pediatric nurse practitioner]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]].\n\nWithin months of the adoption, Jeane began taking Candace to a [[psychiatrist]], complaining about her behavior and attitude at home. Though Candace was treated with medications, Jeane reported that Candace's behavior got worse during the ensuing two years, a period supposedly including her playing with matches and killing goldfish.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_691211,00.html|title=Her name was Candace|last1=Crowder|first1=Carla|last2=Lowe|first2=Peggy|date=October 29, 2000|work=[[Rocky Mountain News]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616035739/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0%2C1299%2CDRMN_15_691211%2C00.html| archivedate=June 16, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Attachment therapy and Candace's death==\n{{See also|Attachment therapy|Reactive attachment disorder}}\nCandace and Jeane Newmaker traveled to [[Evergreen, Colorado]], in April 2000, for a $7,000 two-week \"intensive\" session of [[attachment therapy]] with Connell Watkins (who was without license) upon a referral from William Goble, a licensed psychologist in North Carolina.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite news|last=Siegel|first=Barry|date=February 4, 2001|title=Seeking child's love, a child's life is lost|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|pages=A1, A22-A24}}</ref><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite news|url=http://extras.denverpost.com/news/news0617d.htm|title=Alternative therapies not new in Evergreen|last=Auge|first=Karen|date=June 17, 2000|work=[[The Denver Post]]|accessdate=March 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nCandace died during the second week of the intensive sessions with Watkins during what has been called a \"rebirthing\" session.

Four of the adults (weighing a combined total of 673 pounds) used their hands and feet to push on Candace's head, chest and 70-pound body to resist her attempts to free herself, while she complained, pleaded, and even screamed for help and air, unable to escape from the sheet. Candace stated eleven times during the session that she was dying, to which Ponder responded, \"Go ahead, die right now, for real.

After talking for five minutes, the two unwrapped Candace and found that she was motionless, blue on the fingertips and lips, and not breathing. Upon seeing this, Watkins declared, \"Oh there she is; she's sleeping in her vomit,\" whereupon Newmaker, who had been watching on a monitor in another room, rushed into the room, remarked on Candace's color, and began [[CPR]] while Watkins called [[9-1-1]]. When [[paramedic]]s arrived ten minutes later, McDaniel told them that Candace had been left alone for five minutes during a rebirthing session and was not breathing. The paramedics surmised that Candace had been [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] and possibly not breathing for some time.
