The apex is light ochraceous brown with a large black spot in outer half of interspace 1 and another quadrate black spot at base of interspace 3. The hindwing is light ochraceous brown, closely irrorated with minute black scales.  The subcostal black spot before the apex shows through from the upperside.

The black area on apex and termen of forewing is broader, its inner margin less evenly curved.  A conspicuous large, black spot also exists in the outer half of interspace 1 near the base of interspace 3. On the hindwing the subcostal black spot before the apex is much larger and more prominent. The underside is similar to that of the male but the apex of the forewing and the whole surface of the hindwing is a light ochraceous yellow, not ochraceous brown.  The black discal spots on forewing are much larger. The antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen of the females are the same as for the male.<ref name=\"Bingham\" />\n\n==Habitat==\nThe large white butterfly's habitat consists of large, open spaces, as well as farms and vegetable gardens, because of the availability of its food source. Some favoured locations include walls, fences, tree trunks, and often their food plant, which is important for large white survival since they need to have access to their food source for survival. They primarily hover around these locations, which should contain both wild and cultivated [[Cruciferous vegetables|crucifer]], as well as [[oil-seed rape]], cabbages, and [[Brussels sprouts]].<ref name=\":0\">Carter, D.

Web. 24 Oct. 2013.</ref>\n\n===Life cycle===\n\n====Oviposition====\nThese female butterflies oviposit in clusters on the undersides of leaves because the larvae prefer the morphology of leaf undersides over the upper surface of leaves. To oviposit, the female butterflies use the tip of the abdomen and arrange the ova in specific batches.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe pre-oviposition period, which lasts three to eight days, provides ample time for these butterflies to mate.<ref>Scott, James A. \"Mate-Locating Behavior of Butterflies.\" American Midland Naturalist 91.1 (1974): 103-17. Print.</ref> Females tend to use their forelegs to drum on the surfaces of their intended leaves as a test of the plant's suitability for breeding. If they find a suitable surface, female large whites oviposit two to three days following [[copulation (zoology)|copulation]]. They oviposit approximately six to seven times in eight days. The females can pair up to mate again approximately five or more days after the previous mating.<ref name=\":5\">W. A. L. David and B. O. C. Gardiner (1962).

They favour green surfaces in particular to display [[oviposition]] behaviour. This colour preference could be due to the fact that the large white's food source also acts as a host plant for oviposition.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nMost females choose nectar plants like [[buddleia]] or [[thistles]],<ref name=\":7\">Rowlings, Matt. \"Large White.\" Pieris Brassicae - Field Notes.

Upon hatching, they cause a lot of damage to the host plant by eating away at and destroying the host plant.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Caterpillars and eggs of Large White butterfly - geograph.org.uk - 1009228.jpg|thumb|Eggs and newly hatched caterpillars]]\n[[File:Pieris brassicae (caterpillar).jpg|thumb|Caterpillar]]\n[[File:Pieris brassicae (caterpillar) Portrait.jpg|thumb|Caterpillar]]\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Migration===\nThe large whites are found throughout most of [[Eurasia]], though there are some seasonal fluctuations present due to migration. The northern populations tend to be augmented during the summer migration season from butterflies from southern areas. The large whites fly starting early spring, and keep migrating until seasons shift to autumn and the resultant cold weather. This means the large whites typically take two to three flights per butterfly reproductive season.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n\nLarge white butterfly migration patterns are typically observed only when there is a disturbance. In general, the large white butterfly's migratory patterns are atypical; normally, butterflies fly towards the poles in the spring, and towards the more temperate [[Equator]] during the fall. However, they fly in random directions, excluding north, in the spring, and there is little return migration observed.<ref name=\":4\">Feltwell, John. Large White Butterfly: The Biology, Biochemistry, and Physiology of Pieris Brassicae (Linnaeus). The Hague: W. Junk, 1982. Print.</ref> However, it has been hard to track entire migratory paths, since these butterflies can migrate more than 800 kilometres; thus, individual butterflies may not migrate the 800 kilometres, but rather that other butterflies start their migrations from where the other butterflies ended.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Hibernation===\nLarge white broods in the north have not been seen to [[Overwintering|overwinter]], or hibernate over the winter, successfully. However, they have been observed to hibernate in the south.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref>Pullin, A. S., J. S. Bale, and X. L. R. Fontaine. \"Physiological Aspects of Diapause and Cold Tolerance during Overwintering in Pieris Brassicae.\" Physiological Entomology 16.4 (1991): 447-56. Print.</ref>\n\n===Territorial behaviour===\nMales do not display considerable amounts of territorial behaviour. It has been suggested that this could be a reason why there is no observed significant [[sexual dimorphism]] between the male and female large white butterflies.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Diet and food selection===\n\nLarge white butterflies have a preference for what types of food plant they usually eat. Studies have shown that the preference for certain plants is reliant upon the butterflies' previous experiences. The large white butterflies, then, are shown to rely on the species of food plants, the time of experience, and the choice-situation. Thus, the large white butterflies learn what types of foods they prefer, rather than relying on their sense organs or physiological changes.<ref name=\":3\" /> In contrast, this preference for adult food plant differs from the preference of female large whites using visual cues such as plant colour to determine the best host plants for oviposition.<ref name=\":5\" />\n \nPlants with [[Glucosinolate|mustard-oil glucosides]] are important for this butterfly because it dictates their eating behaviours,<ref name=\":3\" /> and resultant survival rates, as specified in the section regarding oviposition. This is so beneficial for large whites because their large consumption of plants containing mustard oils is the specific reason they are so distasteful to predators, such as birds. Thus, caterpillars are protected from attack, despite them being brightly coloured; in fact, the bright colouration is to signal to predators that they taste bad.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> \n \nHowever, there is more benefit to this species' use of mustard oil glucosides. In addition to predator protection, these glucosides belong to a class of stimuli that produce the biting responses associated with eating. Some plants contain [[alkaloid]]s and [[steroid]]s; these reduce and inhibit the butterflies' responsiveness to mustard oil glucosides. Thus, this utilization of mustard oil glucosides dramatically affects the behaviour of the butterfly, and the resulting food selection for survival.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe food source of the larva of the white butterfly are cabbages, radishes, and the undersides of leaves. Adults feed on flower [[nectar]].\n\n===Predators===\nLarge white butterflies do not have a specific group of predators. Instead, they are preyed upon by a wide range of animals, and even the occasional plant. This butterfly's main predators include birds; however, large whites can also be preyed upon by species in orders such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[Hemiptera]], [[Coleoptera]], [[Diptera]], [[Arachnid]]; some species of [[mammal]]s, one of [[reptile]]s, one species of [[insectivorous plant]], and species in [[amphibian]] orders, as well as other miscellaneous insect species. The butterflies are typically preyed upon as eggs, larvae, and imagines.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Aposematism===\nLarge white butterflies emit an unpleasant smell which deters predators. In addition, large whites are an [[aposematic]] species, meaning that they display warning colours, which benefits the large whites against predation. This aposematic colouration occurs in the [[larval]], [[pupal]], and [[imago]] stages, where toxic mustard oil glycosides from food plants are stored in the individuals' bodies.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=aposem2>{{cite journal|last=Lyytinen|first=Anne|author2=Alatalo, Rauno V. |author3=Lindstr\u00f6m, Leena |author4= Mappes, Johanna |title=Are European White Butterflies Aposematic?|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|date=November 1999|volume=13|issue=7/8|pages=709\u2013719|doi=10.1023/A:1011081800202|url=http://users.jyu.fi/~mappes/publications/Lyytinen_etal_01_evoeco.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> Aposematism is not entirely related to [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]]; however, large white larvae often benefit from multiple other aposematic larvae from other species, such as the larvae of ''[[Papilio machaon]]''.<ref name=aposematism>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=edited by David L.|title=Insect defenses: adaptive mechanisms and strategies of prey and predators|year=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0791406168|pages=182\u2013183|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jpxkhS7O0p0C&pg=PA175&dq=pieris+brassicae+mullerian+mimicry#v=snippet&q=brassicae&f=false|author2=Schmidt, Justin O.}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship to people==\n\n===Role as pests===\nThe crops most susceptible to ''P. brassicae'' damage in areas in Europe are those in the genus ''[[Brassica]]'' ([[cabbage]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], and their allies), particularly [[Brussels sprout]]s, [[cabbage]], [[cauliflower]], [[kohlrabi]], [[Rapeseed|rape]], [[Rutabaga|swede]], and [[turnip]]. The attacks to crops are rather localized and can lead to 100% crop loss in a certain area. In addition, because of its strong inclination to migrate, adults may infest new areas that were previously free from attack. Because many of the host plants of ''P. brassicae'' are sold for consumption, damage by these butterflies can cause a great reduction of crop value. Larvae may also bore into the vegetable heads of cabbage and cauliflower and cause damage. High populations of these larvae may also skeletonise their host plants. In present-day areas such as Great Britain, ''P. brassicae'' are now less threatening as pests because of natural and chemical control reasons. However, it is still considered a pest in other European countries, in China, India, Nepal, and Russia. In fact, it is estimated to cause over 40% yield loss annually on different crop vegetables in India and Turkey.<ref name=purdue>{{cite web|title=Pieris brassicae|url=http://caps.ceris.purdue.edu/webfm_send/1177|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Subspecies==\n* ''Pieris brassicae azorensis'' \n* ''Pieris brassicae brassicae''\n* ''Pieris brassicae ottonis''\n* ''[[Pieris brassicae wollastoni]]'' [[extinction | \u2020]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Madeiran large white]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|26em}}\n{{Commons category|position=left|Pieris brassicae}}\n{{Wikispecies|Pieris brassicae}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q26764}}\n\n[[Category:Pieris (butterfly)|brassicae]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Africa]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Asia]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Europe]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of India]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Iran]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Butterflies described in 1758]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pest insects]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|the breed of swine|Large White pig}}\n{{Italic title}}\n{{Use British English|date=September 2016}}\n{{Speciesbox\n| name = Large white\n| image = Large White.

The underside of the forewing is white, slightly irrorated with black scales at the base of cell and along costa.  The apex is light ochraceous brown with a large black spot in outer half of interspace 1 and another quadrate black spot at base of interspace 3. The hindwing is light ochraceous brown, closely irrorated with minute black scales.  The subcostal black spot before the apex shows through from the upperside.

The antennae, head, thorax, and abdomen of the females are the same as for the male.<ref name=\"Bingham\" />\n\n==Habitat==\nThe large white butterfly's habitat consists of large, open spaces, as well as farms and vegetable gardens, because of the availability of its food source. Some favoured locations include walls, fences, tree trunks, and often their food plant, which is important for large white survival since they need to have access to their food source for survival. They primarily hover around these locations, which should contain both wild and cultivated [[Cruciferous vegetables|crucifer]], as well as [[oil-seed rape]], cabbages, and [[Brussels sprouts]].<ref name=\":0\">Carter, D.

Upon hatching, they cause a lot of damage to the host plant by eating away at and destroying the host plant.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Caterpillars and eggs of Large White butterfly - geograph.org.uk - 1009228.jpg|thumb|Eggs and newly hatched caterpillars]]\n[[File:Pieris brassicae (caterpillar).jpg|thumb|Caterpillar]]\n[[File:Pieris brassicae (caterpillar) Portrait.jpg|thumb|Caterpillar]]\n\n==Behaviour==\n\n===Migration===\nThe large whites are found throughout most of [[Eurasia]], though there are some seasonal fluctuations present due to migration. The northern populations tend to be augmented during the summer migration season from butterflies from southern areas. The large whites fly starting early spring, and keep migrating until seasons shift to autumn and the resultant cold weather. This means the large whites typically take two to three flights per butterfly reproductive season.<ref name=\":9\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":10\" />\n\nLarge white butterfly migration patterns are typically observed only when there is a disturbance. In general, the large white butterfly's migratory patterns are atypical; normally, butterflies fly towards the poles in the spring, and towards the more temperate [[Equator]] during the fall. However, they fly in random directions, excluding north, in the spring, and there is little return migration observed.<ref name=\":4\">Feltwell, John. Large White Butterfly: The Biology, Biochemistry, and Physiology of Pieris Brassicae (Linnaeus). The Hague: W. Junk, 1982. Print.</ref> However, it has been hard to track entire migratory paths, since these butterflies can migrate more than 800 kilometres; thus, individual butterflies may not migrate the 800 kilometres, but rather that other butterflies start their migrations from where the other butterflies ended.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Hibernation===\nLarge white broods in the north have not been seen to [[Overwintering|overwinter]], or hibernate over the winter, successfully. However, they have been observed to hibernate in the south.<ref name=\":8\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref>Pullin, A. S., J. S. Bale, and X. L. R. Fontaine. \"Physiological Aspects of Diapause and Cold Tolerance during Overwintering in Pieris Brassicae.\" Physiological Entomology 16.4 (1991): 447-56. Print.</ref>\n\n===Territorial behaviour===\nMales do not display considerable amounts of territorial behaviour. It has been suggested that this could be a reason why there is no observed significant [[sexual dimorphism]] between the male and female large white butterflies.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n==Ecology==\n\n===Diet and food selection===\n\nLarge white butterflies have a preference for what types of food plant they usually eat. Studies have shown that the preference for certain plants is reliant upon the butterflies' previous experiences. The large white butterflies, then, are shown to rely on the species of food plants, the time of experience, and the choice-situation. Thus, the large white butterflies learn what types of foods they prefer, rather than relying on their sense organs or physiological changes.<ref name=\":3\" /> In contrast, this preference for adult food plant differs from the preference of female large whites using visual cues such as plant colour to determine the best host plants for oviposition.<ref name=\":5\" />\n \nPlants with [[Glucosinolate|mustard-oil glucosides]] are important for this butterfly because it dictates their eating behaviours,<ref name=\":3\" /> and resultant survival rates, as specified in the section regarding oviposition. This is so beneficial for large whites because their large consumption of plants containing mustard oils is the specific reason they are so distasteful to predators, such as birds. Thus, caterpillars are protected from attack, despite them being brightly coloured; in fact, the bright colouration is to signal to predators that they taste bad.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> \n \nHowever, there is more benefit to this species' use of mustard oil glucosides. In addition to predator protection, these glucosides belong to a class of stimuli that produce the biting responses associated with eating. Some plants contain [[alkaloid]]s and [[steroid]]s; these reduce and inhibit the butterflies' responsiveness to mustard oil glucosides. Thus, this utilization of mustard oil glucosides dramatically affects the behaviour of the butterfly, and the resulting food selection for survival.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nThe food source of the larva of the white butterfly are cabbages, radishes, and the undersides of leaves. Adults feed on flower [[nectar]].\n\n===Predators===\nLarge white butterflies do not have a specific group of predators. Instead, they are preyed upon by a wide range of animals, and even the occasional plant. This butterfly's main predators include birds; however, large whites can also be preyed upon by species in orders such as [[Hymenoptera]], [[Hemiptera]], [[Coleoptera]], [[Diptera]], [[Arachnid]]; some species of [[mammal]]s, one of [[reptile]]s, one species of [[insectivorous plant]], and species in [[amphibian]] orders, as well as other miscellaneous insect species. The butterflies are typically preyed upon as eggs, larvae, and imagines.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Aposematism===\nLarge white butterflies emit an unpleasant smell which deters predators. In addition, large whites are an [[aposematic]] species, meaning that they display warning colours, which benefits the large whites against predation. This aposematic colouration occurs in the [[larval]], [[pupal]], and [[imago]] stages, where toxic mustard oil glycosides from food plants are stored in the individuals' bodies.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=aposem2>{{cite journal|last=Lyytinen|first=Anne|author2=Alatalo, Rauno V. |author3=Lindstr\u00f6m, Leena |author4= Mappes, Johanna |title=Are European White Butterflies Aposematic?|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|date=November 1999|volume=13|issue=7/8|pages=709\u2013719|doi=10.1023/A:1011081800202|url=http://users.jyu.fi/~mappes/publications/Lyytinen_etal_01_evoeco.pdf|accessdate=1 December 2013}}</ref> Aposematism is not entirely related to [[M\u00fcllerian mimicry]]; however, large white larvae often benefit from multiple other aposematic larvae from other species, such as the larvae of ''[[Papilio machaon]]''.<ref name=aposematism>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=edited by David L.|title=Insect defenses: adaptive mechanisms and strategies of prey and predators|year=1990|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany|isbn=978-0791406168|pages=182\u2013183|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jpxkhS7O0p0C&pg=PA175&dq=pieris+brassicae+mullerian+mimicry#v=snippet&q=brassicae&f=false|author2=Schmidt, Justin O.}}</ref>\n\n==Relationship to people==\n\n===Role as pests===\nThe crops most susceptible to ''P. brassicae'' damage in areas in Europe are those in the genus ''[[Brassica]]'' ([[cabbage]], [[mustard plant|mustard]], and their allies), particularly [[Brussels sprout]]s, [[cabbage]], [[cauliflower]], [[kohlrabi]], [[Rapeseed|rape]], [[Rutabaga|swede]], and [[turnip]]. The attacks to crops are rather localized and can lead to 100% crop loss in a certain area. In addition, because of its strong inclination to migrate, adults may infest new areas that were previously free from attack. Because many of the host plants of ''P. brassicae'' are sold for consumption, damage by these butterflies can cause a great reduction of crop value. Larvae may also bore into the vegetable heads of cabbage and cauliflower and cause damage. High populations of these larvae may also skeletonise their host plants. In present-day areas such as Great Britain, ''P. brassicae'' are now less threatening as pests because of natural and chemical control reasons. However, it is still considered a pest in other European countries, in China, India, Nepal, and Russia. In fact, it is estimated to cause over 40% yield loss annually on different crop vegetables in India and Turkey.<ref name=purdue>{{cite web|title=Pieris brassicae|url=http://caps.ceris.purdue.edu/webfm_send/1177|accessdate=21 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Subspecies==\n* ''Pieris brassicae azorensis'' \n* ''Pieris brassicae brassicae''\n* ''Pieris brassicae ottonis''\n* ''[[Pieris brassicae wollastoni]]'' [[extinction | \u2020]]\n\n==See also==\n* [[Madeiran large white]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|26em}}\n{{Commons category|position=left|Pieris brassicae}}\n{{Wikispecies|Pieris brassicae}}\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q26764}}\n\n[[Category:Pieris (butterfly)|brassicae]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Africa]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Asia]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Europe]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of India]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Iran]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Butterflies of Turkey]]\n[[Category:Butterflies described in 1758]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus]]\n[[Category:Agricultural pest insects]]\n", "name_user": "Stavast22", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOviposition", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieris_brassicae"}

The U.S. federal voting district boundaries that produce a majority of constituents representative of African-American or other racial minorities are known as \"[[Majority minority|majority-minority districts]]\". Gerrymandering can also be used to protect [[incumbent]]s.

Federalist newspaper editors and others at the time likened the district shape to a salamander, and the word ''gerrymander'' was a [[portmanteau]] of that word and Governor Gerry's last name.]]\n\nThe word gerrymander (originally written Gerry-mander) was used for the first time in the Boston Gazette (not to be confused with the original ''[[Boston Gazette]]'') on 26 March 1812. The word was created in reaction to a redrawing of [[Massachusetts]] state senate election districts under Governor [[Elbridge Gerry]].

When the party controlling the districting process has a statewide majority, packing is usually not necessary to attain partisan advantage; the minority party can generally be \"cracked\" everywhere. Packing is therefore more likely to be used for partisan advantage when the party controlling the districting process has a statewide minority, because by forfeiting a few districts packed with the opposition, cracking can be used in forming the remaining districts.\n* \"Hijacking\" redraws two districts in such a way as to force two incumbents to run against each other in one district, ensuring that one of them will be eliminated.<ref name=\"ProP201111022\" />\n* \"Kidnapping\" moves an incumbent's home address into another district.<ref name=\"ProP201111022\" /> Reelection can become more difficult when the incumbent no longer resides in the district, or possibly faces reelection from a new district with a new voter base. This is often employed against politicians who represent multiple urban areas, in which larger cities will be removed from the district in order to make the district more rural.\n\nThese tactics are typically combined in some form, creating a few \"forfeit\" seats for packed voters of one type in order to secure more seats and greater representation for voters of another type. This results in candidates of one party (the one responsible for the gerrymandering) winning by small majorities in most of the districts, and another party winning by a large majority in only a few of the districts.\n\n==Effects==\n\nGerrymandering is effective because of the [[wasted vote|wasted vote effect]]. ''Wasted votes'' are votes that did not contribute to electing a candidate, either because they were in excess of the bare minimum needed for victory or because the candidate lost. By moving geographic boundaries, the incumbent party packs opposition voters into a few districts they will already win, wasting the extra votes. Other districts are more tightly constructed with the opposition party allowed a bare minority count, thereby wasting all the minority votes for the losing candidate. These districts constitute the majority of districts and are drawn to produce a result favoring the incumbent party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/231865/gerrymandering|title=gerrymandering - politics|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nA quantitative measure of the effect of gerrymandering is the [[efficiency gap]], computed from the difference in the wasted votes for two different political parties summed over all the districts.<ref name=\"82UofCLawReview\">{{Cite journal|last=Stephanopoulos|first=Nicholas|last2=McGhee|first2=Eric|year=2014|title=Partisan Gerrymandering and the Efficiency Gap|journal=University of Chicago Law Review|volume=82|page=831|ssrn=2457468}}</ref><ref name=\"NewRepublic20140702\">{{Cite magazine|last=Stephanopoulos|first=Nicholas|date=2 July 2014|title=Here's How We Can End Gerrymandering Once and for All|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118534/gerrymandering-efficiency-gap-better-way-measure-gerrymandering|magazine=The New Republic|access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref>  Citing in part an efficiency gap of 11.69% to 13%, a U.S. District Court in 2016 ruled against the 2011 drawing of Wisconsin legislative districts.

To minimize the risk of demographic or political shifts swinging a district to the opposition, politicians can create more packed districts, leading to more comfortable margins in unpacked ones.\n\n===Effect on electoral competition===\n\n[[File:Gerrymandering 9-6.png|thumb|How gerrymandering can influence electoral results on a [[Voting system#Nonproportional and semiproportional methods|non-proportional system]].

Some say that, rather than packing the voters of their party into uncompetitive districts, party leaders tend to prefer to spread their party's voters into multiple districts, so that their party can win a larger number of races.<ref>Seth E. Masket, Jonathan Winburn and Gerald C. Wright, [https://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8469145&fulltextType=RA&fileId=S1049096511001703 The Gerrymanderers Are Coming! Legislative Redistricting Won't Affect Competition or Polarization Much, No Matter Who Does It].</ref> (See scenario '''(c)''' in the box.) This may lead to increased competition. Instead of gerrymandering, some researchers find that other factors, such as partisan polarization and the incumbency advantage, have driven the recent decreases in electoral competition.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forgette|first1=Richard|last2=Winkle|first2=John W.|date=March 2006|title=Partisan Gerrymandering and the Voting Rights Act*|journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=87|issue=1|pages=155\u2013173|doi=10.1111/j.0038-4941.2006.00374.x}}</ref> Similarly, a 2009 study found that \"congressional polarization is primarily a function of the differences in how Democrats and Republicans represent the same districts rather than a function of which districts each party represents or the distribution of constituency preferences.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McCarty|first1=Nolan|last2=Poole|first2=Keith T.|last3=Rosenthal|first3=Howard|date=July 2009|title=Does Gerrymandering Cause Polarization?|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~miaryc/PEW/Nolan_McCarty_PEWCaltech.pdf|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=53|issue=3|pages=666\u2013680|citeseerx=10.1.1.491.3072|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x}}</ref>\n\nThese findings are, however, a matter of some dispute. While gerrymandering may not decrease electoral competition in all cases, there are certainly instances where gerrymandering does reduce such competition.\n\nOne state in which gerrymandering has arguably had an adverse effect on electoral competition is California. In 2000, a bipartisan redistricting effort redrew congressional district lines in ways that all but guaranteed incumbent victories; as a result, California saw only one congressional seat change hands between 2000 and 2010. In response to this obvious gerrymandering, a 2010 referendum in California gave the power to redraw congressional district lines to the [[California Citizens Redistricting Commission]], which had been created to draw California State Senate and Assembly districts by another referendum in 2008. In stark contrast to the redistricting efforts that followed the 2000 census, the redistricting commission has created a number of the most competitive congressional districts in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/us/california-congressional-delegation-braces-for-change.html|title=New Faces Set For California in the Capitol|last=Nagourney|first=Adam|date=14 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Increased incumbent advantage and campaign costs===\nThe effect of gerrymandering for incumbents is particularly advantageous, as incumbents are far more likely to be reelected under conditions of gerrymandering. For example, in 2002, according to political scientists [[Norman Ornstein]] and [[Thomas E. Mann|Thomas Mann]], only four challengers were able to defeat incumbent members of the U.S. Congress, the lowest number in modern American history.<ref name=\"7_buck_trust.html\">{{cite web|url=http://www.centrists.org/pages/2004/07/7_buck_trust.html|title=Iowa's Redistricting Process: An Example of the Right Way to Draw Legislative|date=22 July 2004|publisher=Centrists.Org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107114029/http://www.centrists.org/pages/2004/07/7_buck_trust.html|archivedate=7 November 2009|accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref> Incumbents are likely to be of the majority party orchestrating a gerrymander, and incumbents are usually easily renominated in subsequent elections, including incumbents among the minority.\n\nMann, a Senior Fellow of Governance Studies at the [[Brookings Institution]], has also noted that \"Redistricting is a deeply political process, with incumbents actively seeking to minimize the risk to themselves (via bipartisan gerrymanders) or to gain additional seats for their party (via partisan gerrymanders)\".<ref>Mann, Thomas E. \"Redistricting Reform.\" The Brookings Institution. Brookings.edu, 1 June 2005. Web. 5 February 2013. <http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2005/06/01politics-mann></ref> The bipartisan gerrymandering that Mann mentions refers to the fact that legislators often also draw distorted legislative districts even when such redistricting does not provide an advantage to their party.\n\nGerrymandering of state legislative districts can effectively guarantee an incumbent's victory by 'shoring up' a district with higher levels of partisan support, without disproportionately benefiting a particular political party. This can be highly problematic from a governance perspective, because forming districts to ensure high levels of partisanship often leads to higher levels of partisanship in legislative bodies. If a substantial number of districts are designed to be polarized, then those districts' representation will also likely act in a heavily partisan manner, which can create and perpetuate partisan gridlock.\n\nThis demonstrates that gerrymandering can have a deleterious effect on the principle of democratic accountability. With uncompetitive seats/districts reducing the fear that incumbent politicians may lose office, they have less incentive to represent the interests of their constituents, even when those interests conform to majority support for an issue across the electorate as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Incumbent politicians may look out more for their party's interests than for those of their constituents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nGerrymandering can affect campaign costs for district elections. If districts become increasingly stretched out, candidates must pay increased costs for transportation and trying to develop and present [[campaign advertising]] across a district.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ced.org/reports/solving-the-problem-of-partisan-gerrymandering|title=Let the Voters Choose|last=CED|first=|date=13 March 2018|work=Committee for Economic Development|access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref> The incumbent's advantage in securing campaign funds is another benefit of his or her having a gerrymandered secure seat.\n\n===Less descriptive representation===\nGerrymandering also has significant effects on the [[representation (politics)|representation]] received by voters in gerrymandered districts. Because gerrymandering can be designed to increase the number of wasted votes among the electorate, the relative representation of particular groups can be drastically altered from their actual share of the voting population. This effect can significantly prevent a gerrymandered system from achieving proportional and [[descriptive representation]], as the winners of elections are increasingly determined by who is drawing the districts rather than the preferences of the voters.\n\nGerrymandering may be advocated to improve representation within the legislature among otherwise underrepresented minority groups by packing them into a single district. This can be controversial, as it may lead to those groups' remaining marginalized in the government as they become confined to a single district. Candidates outside that district no longer need to represent them to win elections.\n\nAs an example, much of the redistricting conducted in the United States in the early 1990s involved the intentional creation of additional \"majority-minority\" districts where racial minorities such as African Americans were packed into the majority. This \"maximization policy\" drew support by both the Republican Party (who had limited support among African Americans and could concentrate their power elsewhere) and by minority representatives elected as Democrats from these constituencies, who then had safe seats. <!-- cite a famous politician or political scientist that has a good quote of this here -->\n\nThe 2012 election provides a number of examples as to how partisan gerrymandering can adversely affect the descriptive function of states' congressional delegations. In Pennsylvania, for example, Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives received 83,000 more votes than Republican candidates, yet the Republican-controlled redistricting process in 2010 resulted in Democrats losing to their Republican counterparts in 13 out of Pennsylvania's 18 districts.<ref>Ting, Jan C. \"Boehner and House Republicans Lack Mandate to Oppose Obama.\" NewsWorks.

Web. 5 February 2013.\n[https://whyy.org/articles/boehner-and-house-republicans-lack-mandate-to-oppose-obama/]\n</ref>\n\nIn the seven states where Republicans had complete control over the redistricting process, Republican House candidates received 16.7 million votes and Democratic House candidates received 16.4 million votes. The redistricting resulted in Republican victories in 73 out of the 107 affected seats; in those 7 states, Republicans received 50.4% of the votes but won in over 68% of the congressional districts.<ref>Wang, Sam. \"The Great Gerrymander of 2012.\" The New York Times. 2 February 2013.

If only a Democratic landslide were needed, why wouldn't a majority vote do the trick? I think editor means \"landslide in the respective cities to offset the outlying vote.\"|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Incumbent gerrymandering===\nGerrymandering can also be done to help incumbents as a whole, effectively turning every district into a packed one and greatly reducing the potential for competitive elections. This is particularly likely to occur when the minority party has significant obstruction power\u2014unable to enact a partisan gerrymander, the legislature instead agrees on ensuring their own mutual reelection.\n\nIn an unusual occurrence in 2000, for example, the two dominant parties in the state of California [[Redistricting in California|cooperatively redrew]] both state and Federal legislative districts to preserve the status quo, ensuring the electoral safety of the politicians from unpredictable voting by the electorate. This move proved completely effective, as no State or Federal legislative office changed party in the [[2004 U.S. House election|2004 election]], although 53 congressional, 20 state senate, and 80 state assembly seats were potentially at risk.\n\nIn 2006, the term \"70/30 District\" came to signify the equitable split of two evenly split (i.e. 50/50) districts. The resulting districts gave each party a guaranteed seat and retained their respective power base.\n\n===Prison-based gerrymandering===\nPrison-based gerrymandering occurs when prisoners are counted as residents of a particular district, increasing the district's population with non-voters when assigning political apportionment. This phenomenon violates the principle of [[one person, one vote]] because, although many prisoners come from (and return to) urban communities, they are counted as \"residents\" of the rural districts that contain large prisons, thereby artificially inflating the political representation in districts with prisons at the expense of voters in all other districts without prisons.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/news/2006/05/20/NYT-gerrymandering|title=Prison-Based Gerrymandering|date=20 May 2006|newspaper=The New York Times|type=Editorial}}</ref> Others contend that prisoners should not be counted as residents of their original districts when they do not reside there and are [[disenfranchisement|not legally eligible to vote]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A9710-D.html|title=New York Prison-Based Gerrymandering Bill|last=Initiative|first=Prison Policy|date=|website=www.prisonersofthecensus.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A11597.html|title=New York Prison-Based Gerrymandering Technical Amendment|last=Initiative|first=Prison Policy|date=|website=www.prisonersofthecensus.org}}</ref>\n\n==Changes to achieve competitive elections==\n[[File:map22007.gif|thumb|250px|Electoral divisions in the Sydney area, drawn by the politically independent [[Australian Electoral Commission]]]]\nDue to the perceived issues associated with gerrymandering and its effect on competitive elections and democratic accountability, numerous countries have enacted reforms making the practice either more difficult or less effective. Countries such as the U.K., Australia, Canada and most of those in Europe have transferred responsibility for defining constituency boundaries to neutral or cross-party bodies. In Spain, they are constitutionally fixed since 1978.<ref name=\"ES_Const\" />\n\nIn the United States, however, such reforms are controversial and frequently meet particularly strong opposition from groups that benefit from gerrymandering. In a more neutral system, they might lose considerable influence.\n\n=== Redistricting by neutral or cross-party agency ===\nThe most commonly advocated electoral reform proposal targeted at gerrymandering is to change the redistricting process. Under these proposals, an independent and presumably objective commission is created specifically for redistricting, rather than having the legislature do it.\n\nThis is the system used in the United Kingdom, where the independent [[boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|boundary commissions]] determine the boundaries for [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved legislatures]], subject to ratification by the body in question (almost always granted without debate). A similar situation exists in Australia where the independent [[Australian Electoral Commission]] and its state-based counterparts determine electoral boundaries for federal, state and local jurisdictions.\n\nTo help ensure neutrality, members of a redistricting agency may be appointed from relatively apolitical sources such as retired judges or longstanding members of the civil service, possibly with requirements for adequate representation among competing political parties. Additionally, members of the board can be denied access to information that might aid in gerrymandering, such as the demographic makeup or voting patterns of the population.\n\nAs a further constraint, [[consensus]] requirements can be imposed to ensure that the resulting district map reflects a wider perception of fairness, such as a requirement for a supermajority approval of the commission for any district proposal. Consensus requirements, however, can lead to deadlock, such as occurred in [[Missouri]] following the 2000 census. There, the equally numbered partisan appointees were unable to reach consensus in a reasonable time, and consequently the courts had to determine district lines.\n\nIn the U.S. state of [[Iowa]], the nonpartisan Legislative Services Bureau (LSB, akin to the [[U.S. Congressional Research Service]]) determines boundaries of electoral districts. Aside from satisfying federally mandated contiguity and population equality criteria, the LSB mandates unity of counties and cities. Consideration of political factors such as location of incumbents, previous boundary locations, and political party proportions is specifically forbidden. Since Iowa's counties are chiefly regularly shaped [[polygons]], the LSB process has led to districts that follow county lines.<ref name=\"7_buck_trust.html\" />\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. state of [[Ohio]] had a ballot measure to create an independent commission whose first priority was competitive districts, a sort of \"reverse gerrymander\". A complex mathematical formula was to be used to determine the competitiveness of a district. The measure failed voter approval chiefly due to voter concerns that communities of interest would be broken up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/2005/11/08/oh/state/issue/4/|title=Issue 4: Independent Redistricting Process \u2013 Ohio State Government|date=|publisher=Smartvoter.org|accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the [[Open Our Democracy Act of 2017]] was submitted to the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] by [[John Delaney (Maryland politician)|Rep. Delaney]] as a means to implement non-partisan redistricting.\n\n===Transparency regulations===\nWhen a single political party controls both legislative houses of a state during redistricting, both Democrats and Republicans have displayed a marked propensity for couching the process in secrecy; in May 2010, for example, the Republican National Committee held a redistricting training session in Ohio where the theme was \"Keep it Secret, Keep it Safe\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2011/12/13/study-of-gop-maps-points-to-politics.html|title=Study of GOP Maps Points to Politics|last1=Siegel|first1=Jim|date=13 December 2011|publisher=Dispatch.com|access-date=5 March 2013}}</ref> The need for increased transparency in redistricting processes is clear; a 2012 investigation by The Center for Public Integrity reviewed every state's redistricting processes for both transparency and potential for public input, and ultimately assigned 24 states grades of either D or F.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://openchannel.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/01/14839356-behind-closed-doors-gop-and-dems-alike-cloaked-redistricting-in-secrecy|title=Behind Closed Doors: GOP and Dems Alike Cloaked Redistricting in Secrecy|last=Kusnetz|first=Nicholas|date=1 November 2012|work=NBC News}}</ref>\n\nIn response to these types of problems, redistricting transparency legislation has been introduced to US Congress a number of times in recent years, including the Redistricting Transparency Acts of 2010, 2011, and 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr4918|title=Redistricting Transparency Act of 2010 (2010; 111th Congress H.R. 4918) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr419|title=Redistricting Transparency Act of 2011 (2011; 112th Congress H.R. 419) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr337|title=Redistricting Transparency Act of 2013 (2013; 113th Congress H.R. 337) - GovTrack.us|work=GovTrack.us}}</ref> Such policy proposals aim to increase the transparency and responsiveness of the redistricting systems in the US. The merit of increasing transparency in redistricting processes is based largely on the premise that lawmakers would be less inclined to draw gerrymandered districts if they were forced to defend such districts in a public forum.\n\n===Changing the voting system===\nBecause gerrymandering relies on the [[wasted vote|wasted-vote effect]], the use of a different voting system with fewer wasted votes can help reduce gerrymandering. In particular, the use of [[multimember district|multi-member districts]] alongside voting systems establishing proportional representation such as [[Single Transferable Voting|single transferable voting]] can reduce wasted votes and gerrymandering. Semi-proportional voting systems such as [[single non-transferable vote]] or [[cumulative voting]] are relatively simple and similar to ''first past the post'' and can also reduce the proportion of wasted votes and thus potential gerrymandering. Electoral reformers have advocated all three as replacement systems.<ref>See, e.g., Richard L. Engstrom, The Single Transferable Vote: An Alternative Remedy for Minority Vote Dilution, 27 U.S.F.L.Rev. 781, 806 (1993) (arguing that the Single Transferable Voting systems maintain minority electoral opportunities); Steven J. Mulroy, Alternative Ways Out: A Remedial Road Map for the Use of Alternative Electoral Systems as Voting Rights Act Remedies, 77 N.C.L.Rev. 1867, 1923 (1999) (concluding that ranked-ballot voting systems avoid minority vote dilution); Steven J. Mulroy, The Way Out: A Legal Standard for Imposing Alternative Electoral Systems as Voting Rights Remedies, 33 Harv.C.R.-C.L.L.Rev. 333, 350 (1998) (arguing that preferential voting systems enhance minority representation); and Alexander Athan Yanos, Note, Reconciling the Right to Vote With the Voting Rights Act, 92 Colum.L.Rev. 1810, 1865\u201366 (1992) (arguing that Single Transferable Voting serves to preserve the minority party's right to representation).</ref>\n\nElectoral systems with various forms of proportional representation are now found in nearly all European countries, resulting in multi-party systems (with many parties represented in the parliaments) with higher voter attendance in the elections,<ref>{{Citation|last1=Pintor|first1=Rafael L\u00f3pez|title=Voter Turnout Rates from a Comparative Perspective|url=http://www.idea.int/publications/vt/upload/Voter%20turnout.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2014|last2=Gratschew|first2=Maria|last3=Sullivan|first3=Kate}}</ref> fewer wasted votes, and a wider variety of political opinions represented.\n\nElectoral systems with election of just one winner in each district (i.e., \"winner-takes-all\" electoral systems) and no proportional distribution of extra mandates to smaller parties tend to create two-party systems ([[Duverger's law]]). In these, just two parties effectively compete in the national elections and thus the national political discussions are forced into a narrow two-party frame, where loyalty and forced statements inside the two parties distort the political debate.{{According to whom|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Changing the size of districts and the elected body===\nIf a proportional or semi-proportional voting system is used then increasing the number of winners in any given district will reduce the number of wasted votes. This can be accomplished both by merging separate districts together and by increasing the total size of the body to be elected. Since gerrymandering relies on exploiting the wasted vote effect, increasing the number of winners per district can reduce the potential for gerrymandering in proportional systems. Unless all districts are merged, however, this method cannot eliminate gerrymandering entirely.\n\nIn contrast to proportional methods, if a nonproportional voting system with multiple winners (such as [[plurality-at-large voting|block voting]]) is used, then increasing the size of the elected body while keeping the number of districts constant will not reduce the amount of wasted votes, leaving the potential for gerrymandering the same. While merging districts together under such a system can reduce the potential for gerrymandering, doing so also amplifies the tendency of block voting to produce [[landslide victory|landslide victories]], creating a similar effect to gerrymandering by concentrating wasted votes among the opposition and denying them representation.\n\nIf a system of single-winner elections is used, then increasing the size of the elected body will implicitly increase the number of districts to be created. This change can actually make gerrymandering easier when raising the number of single-winner elections, as opposition groups can be more efficiently packed into smaller districts without accidentally including supporters, further increasing the number of wasted votes amongst the opposition.\n\n===Using fixed districts===\nAnother way to avoid gerrymandering is simply to stop redistricting altogether and use existing political boundaries such as state, county, or provincial lines. While this prevents future gerrymandering, any existing advantage may become deeply ingrained. The [[United States Senate]], for instance, has more competitive elections than the House of Representatives due to the use of existing state borders rather than gerrymandered districts\u2014Senators are elected by their entire state, while Representatives are elected in legislatively drawn districts.\n\nThe use of fixed districts creates an additional problem, however, in that fixed districts do not take into account changes in population. Individual voters can come to have very different degrees of influence on the legislative process. This [[malapportionment]] can greatly affect representation after long periods of time or large population movements. In the United Kingdom during the [[Industrial Revolution]], several constituencies that had been fixed since they gained representation in the Parliament of England became so small that they could be won with only a handful of voters (''[[rotten borough]]s''). Similarly, in the U.S. the state legislature of Alabama refused to redistrict for more than 60 years, despite major changes in population patterns. By 1960 less than a quarter of the state's population controlled the majority of seats in the legislature.<ref>Dr. Michael McDonald, U.S. Elections Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary [http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm Dept. of Public and International Affairs George Mason University]. Retrieved 6 April 2008. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624024455/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm|date=24 June 2008}}</ref> However, this practice of using fixed districts for state legislatures was effectively banned in the United States after the ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' Supreme Court decision in 1964, establishing a rule of [[one man, one vote]].\n\n===Objective rules to create districts===\nAnother means to reduce gerrymandering is to create objective, precise criteria to which any district map must comply. Courts in the United States, for instance, have ruled that congressional districts must be contiguous in order to be constitutional.<ref>[[wikisource:Reynolds v. Sims|Reynolds v. Sims]] states that \"a state legislative apportionment scheme may properly give representation to various political subdivisions and provide for compact districts of contiguous territory if substantial equality among districts is maintained.\" See also [[Reynolds v. Sims|the Wikipedia article]].</ref> This, however, is not a particularly binding constraint, as very narrow strips of land with few or no voters in them may be used to connect separate regions for inclusion in one district, as is the case in [[Illinois's 4th congressional district]].\n\nDepending on the distribution of voters for a particular party, metrics that maximize compactness can be opposed to metrics that minimize the efficiency gap.  For example, in the United States, voters registered with the Democratic Party tend to be concentrated in cities, potentially resulting in a large number of \"wasted\" votes if compact districts are drawn around city populations.  Neither of these metrics take into consideration other possible goals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hating-gerrymandering-is-easy-fixing-it-is-harder/|title=Hating Gerrymandering Is Easy. Fixing It Is Harder.|last=Wasserman|first=David|date=25 January 2018|website=fivethirtyeight.com}}</ref> such as proportional representation based on other demographic characteristics (such as race, ethnicity, gender, or income), maximizing competitiveness of elections (the greatest number of districts where party affiliation is 50/50), avoiding splits of existing government units (like cities and counties), and ensuring representation of major interest groups (like farmers or voters in a specific transportation corridor), though any of these could be incorporated into a more complicated metric.\n\n====Minimum district to convex polygon ratio====\nOne method is to define a minimum district to [[convex polygon]] ratio {{Definition needed|date=July 2016}} . To use this method, every proposed district is circumscribed by the smallest possible convex polygon (its [[convex hull]]; think of stretching a rubberband around the outline of the district). Then, the area of the district is divided{{elucidate|date=December 2015}} by the area of the polygon; or, if at the edge of the state, by the portion of the area of the polygon within state boundaries.\n[[File:GeorgiaDistricts8and10.png|frame|right|Minimal convex polygon, showing how to rate district shape irregularity.]]\nThe advantages of this method are that it allows a certain amount of human intervention to take place (thus solving the Colorado problem of [[#Shortest splitline algorithm|splitline districting]]); it allows the borders of the district to follow existing jagged subdivisions, such as neighbourhoods or voting districts (something isoperimetric rules would discourage); and it allows concave coastline districts, such as the Florida gulf coast area. It would mostly eliminate bent districts, but still permit long, straight ones. However, since human intervention is still allowed, the gerrymandering issues of packing and cracking would still occur, just to a lesser extent.\n\n====Shortest splitline algorithm====\nThe [[Center for Range Voting]] has proposed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org/GerryExamples.html|title=Gerrymandering and a cure\u2014shortest splitline algorithm|date=|publisher=RangeVoting.org|accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref> a way to draw districts by a simple [[algorithm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org|title=RangeVoting.org \u2013 Center for Range Voting}}</ref> The algorithm uses only the shape of the state, the number N of districts wanted, and the population distribution as inputs. The algorithm (slightly simplified) is:\n\n# Start with the boundary outline of the state.\n# Let N=A+B where N is the number of districts to create, and A and B are two whole numbers, either equal (if N is even) or differing by exactly one (if N is odd). For example, if N is 10, each of A and B would be 5. If N is 7, A would be 4 and B would be 3.\n# Among all possible straight lines that split the state into two parts with the population ratio A:B, choose the ''shortest''. If there are two or more such shortest lines, choose the one that is most north-south in direction; if there is still more than one possibility, choose the westernmost.\n# We now have two hemi-states, each to contain a specified number (namely A and B) of districts. Handle them recursively via the same splitting procedure.\n# Any human residence that is split in two or more parts by the resulting lines is considered to be a part of the most north-eastern of the resulting districts; if this does not decide it, then of the most northern.\n\nThis district-drawing algorithm has the advantages of simplicity, ultra-low cost, a single possible result (thus no possibility of human interference), lack of intentional bias, and it produces simple boundaries that do not meander needlessly. It has the disadvantage of ignoring geographic features such as rivers, cliffs, and highways and cultural features such as tribal boundaries. This landscape oversight causes it to produce districts different from those a human would produce. Ignoring geographic features can induce very simple boundaries.\n\nWhile most districts produced by the method will be fairly compact and either roughly rectangular or triangular, some of the resulting districts can still be long and narrow strips (or triangles) of land.\n\nLike most automatic redistricting rules, the shortest splitline algorithm will fail to create majority-minority districts, for both ethnic and political minorities, if the minority populations are not very compact. This might reduce minority representation.\n\nAnother criticism of the system is that splitline districts sometimes divide and diffuse the voters in a large metropolitan area. This condition is most likely to occur when one of the first splitlines cuts through the metropolitan area. It is often considered a drawback of the system because residents of the same agglomeration are assumed to be a community of common interest. This is most evident in the splitline allocation of [[Colorado]].<ref>http://www.rangevoting.org/SSHR/co_final.png</ref>\n\nAs of July 2007, shortest-splitline redistricting pictures, based on the results of the 2000 census, are available for all 50 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org/SplitLR.html|title=Splitline districtings of all 50 states + DC + PR|date=|publisher=RangeVoting.org|accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Minimum isoperimetric quotient====\n{{See also|Compactness measure of a shape|Polsby\u2013Popper test}}\nIt is possible to define a specific minimum [[Isoperimetric inequality|isoperimetric quotient]],<ref name=\"siam.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siam.org/pdf/news/1237.pdf|title=James Case \"Flagrant Gerrymandering: Help from the Isoperimetric Theorem?\"|date=|accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref> proportional to the ratio between the area and the square of the perimeter of any given congressional voting district. Although technologies presently exist to define districts in this manner, there are no rules in place mandating their use, and no national movement to implement such a policy. One problem with the simplest version of this rule is that it would prevent incorporation of jagged natural boundaries, such as rivers or mountains; when such boundaries are required, such as at the edge of a state, certain districts may not be able to meet the required minima. One way of avoiding this problem is to allow districts which share a border with a state border to replace that border with a polygon or semi-circle enclosing the state boundary as a kind of virtual boundary definition, but using the actual perimeter of the district whenever this occurs inside the state boundaries. Enforcing a minimum isoperimetric quotient would encourage districts with a high ratio between area and perimeter.<ref name=\"siam.org\" />\n\n====Efficiency gap calculation====\n{{see also|Wasted vote#Efficiency gap}}\nThe efficiency gap is a simply-calculable measure that can show the effects of gerrymandering.<ref name=\"TheNewRepublic\">{{cite journal|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118534/gerrymandering-efficiency-gap-better-way-measure-gerrymandering|title=Here's How We Can End Gerrymandering Once and for All|journal=The New Republic|author=Nicholas Stephanopoulas|date=3 July 2014|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> It measures wasted votes for each party: the sum of votes cast in losing districts (losses due to cracking) and excess votes cast in winning districts (losses due to packing).  The difference in these wasted votes are divided by total votes cast, and the resulting percentage is the efficiency gap.\n\n==Use of databases and computer technology==\n{{See also|Geographic information system}}\nThe introduction of modern computers alongside the development of elaborate [[voter database]]s and special districting software has made gerrymandering a far more precise science. Using such databases, political parties can obtain detailed information about every household including political party registration, previous campaign donations, and the number of times residents voted in previous elections and combine it with other predictors of voting behavior such as age, income, race, or education level. With this data, gerrymandering politicians can predict the voting behavior of each potential district with an astonishing degree of precision, leaving little chance for creating an accidentally competitive district.\n\nOn the other hand, the introduction of modern computers would let the United States Census Bureau to calculate more equal populations in every voting district that are based only on districts being the most compact and equal populations. This could be done easily using their Block Centers based on the Global Positioning System rather than street addresses.  With this data, gerrymandering politicians will not be in charge, thus allowing competitive districts again.\n\nOnline web apps such as [[Dave's Redistricting]] have allowed users to simulate redistricting states into legislative districts as they wish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gardow.com/davebradlee/default.html|title=Dave Bradlee|last1=Bradlee|first1=Dave|website=Gardow.com|accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/the-great-gerrymander-of-2012.html|title=The Great Gerrymander of 2012|last1=Wang|first1=Sam|accessdate=3 September 2018|website=The New York Times}}</ref> According to Bradlee, the software was designed to \"put power in people's hands,\" and so that they \"can see how the process works, so it's a little less mysterious than it was 10 years ago.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-03-21-redistricting21_ST_N.htm|title=Technology allows citizens to be part of redistricting process|last1=Korte|first1=Gregory|website=USA Today|accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Markov chain Monte Carlo|Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)]] can measure the extent to which redistricting plans favor a particular party or group in election, and can support automated redistricting simulators.<ref name=\"B Fifield, M Higgins, K Imai, A Tarr, 2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Fifield|first1=B.|last2=Higgins|first2=M.|last3=Imai|first3=K.|last4=Tarr|first4=A.|date=2015|title=A new automated redistricting simulator using markov chain monte carlo|url=https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/redist|type=Working Paper}}</ref>\n\n==Voting systems==\n\n===First-past-the-post===\nGerrymandering is most likely to emerge, in majoritarian systems, where the country is divided into several voting districts and the candidate with the most votes wins the district. If the ruling party is in charge of drawing the district lines, it can abuse the fact that in a majoritarian system all votes that do not go to the winning candidate are essentially irrelevant to the composition of a new government. Even though, Gerrymandering can be used in other voting systems, it has the most significant impact on voting outcomes in first-past-the-post systems.<ref>{{cite web |title=Majoritarian electoral systems are more prone to gerrymandering than proportional systems |url=http://www.democraticaudit.com/2016/06/01/majoritarian-electoral-systems-are-more-prone-to-gerrymandering-than-proportional-systems/ |website=Democratic Audit |date=1 June 2016}}</ref> Partisan redrawing of district lines is particularly harmful to democratic principles in majoritarian two-party systems. In general, two party systems tend to be more polarized than proportional systems.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Feuerherd |first1=Peter |title=Is Gerrymandering to Blame for Our Polarized Politics? |url=https://daily.jstor.org/is-gerrymandering-to-blame-for-our-polarized-politics/ |website=JSTOR Daily |date=19 March 2018}}</ref> Possible consequences of Gerrymandering in such a system can be an amplification of polarization in politics and a lack of representation of minorities, as a large part of the constituency is not represented in policy making. However, not every state using a first-past-the-post system is being confronted with the negative impacts of gerrymandering. Some countries, such as Australia, Canada and the UK, authorize non-partisan organizations to set constituency boundaries in attempt to prevent gerrymandering.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solving the Problem of Partisan Gerrymandering |url=https://www.ced.org/reports/solving-the-problem-of-partisan-gerrymandering |website=Committee for Economic Development of The Conference Board |publisher=CED |accessdate=2019-05-15}}</ref>\n\n===Proportional systems===\nThe introduction of a proportional system is often proposed as the most effective solution to partisan gerrymandering.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yglesias |first1=Matthew |title=The real fix for gerrymandering is proportional representation |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/11/16453512/gerrymandering-proportional-representation |website=Vox |accessdate=2019-05-15 |date=11 October 2017}}</ref> In such systems the entire constituency is being represented proportionally to their votes. Even though, voting districts can be part of a proportional system, the redrawing of district lines would not benefit a party, as those districts are mainly of organizational value.\n\n===Mixed systems===\nIn mixed systems that use proportional and majoritarian voting principles, the usage of gerrymandering is a constitutional obstacle that states have to deal with.  However, in mixed systems the advantage a political actor can potentially gain from redrawing district lines is much less than in majoritarian systems. In mixed systems voting districts are mostly being used to avoid that elected parliamentarians are getting too detached from their constituency. The principle which determines the representation in parliament is usually the proportional aspect of the voting system. Seats in parliament are being allocated to each party in accordance to the proportion of their overall votes. In most mixed systems, winning a voting district merely means that a candidate is guaranteed a seat in parliament, but does not expand a party\u2019s share in the overall seats.<ref>{{cite document |last1=Wattenberg |first1=Martin P. |last2=Shugart |first2=Matthew Soberg |title=Mixed\u2010Member Electoral Systems: A Definition and Typology |date=6 February 2003 |doi=10.1093/019925768X.001.0001 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191600241 }}</ref>  However, gerrymandering can still be used to manipulate the outcome in voting districts. In most, democracies with a mixed system, non-partisan institutions are in charge of drawing district lines and therefore Gerrymandering is a less common phenomenon.\n\n==Difference from malapportionment==\n\nGerrymandering should not be confused with [[malapportionment]], whereby the number of eligible voters per elected representative can vary widely without relation to how the boundaries are drawn. Nevertheless, the ''-mander'' suffix has been applied to particular malapportionments. Sometimes political representatives use both gerrymandering and malapportionment to try to maintain power.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/gerrymandering|title=gerrymandering {{!}} politics|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=27 May 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Barasch|first=Emily|title=The Twisted History of Gerrymandering in American Politics|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/the-twisted-history-of-gerrymandering-in-american-politics/262369/|magazine=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=27 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nSeveral western democracies, notably the [[Netherlands]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]] employ an electoral system with only one (nationwide) voting district for election of national representatives.

The number of representatives for each district can change after a census due to population shifts, but their boundaries do not change. This also effectively eliminates gerrymandering.\n\nAdditionally, many countries where the president is directly elected by the citizens (e.g. [[France]], [[Poland]], among others) use only one electoral district for presidential election, despite using multiple districts to elect representatives.\n\n===Bahamas===\n[[1962 Bahamian general election]]\n\n===Australia===\nGerrymandering has not typically been considered a problem in the [[Electoral system of Australia|Australian electoral system]] largely because drawing of electoral boundaries has typically been done by non-partisan [[Australian Electoral Commission|electoral commissions]]. There have been historical cases of [[malapportionment]], whereby the distribution of electors to electorates was not in proportion to the population [[Electoral system of Australia#Gerrymandering and malapportionment|in several states]]. For example, [[Thomas Playford IV|Sir Thomas Playford]] was [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]] of [[South Australia]] from 1938 to 1965 as a result of a system of malapportionment, which became known as the [[Playmander]], despite it not strictly speaking involving a gerrymander.<ref>{{cite book|last = Tilby Stock|first = Jenny|year = 1996|chapter = The 'Playmander': its origins, operations and effect on South Australia|editor1-last = O'Neil|editor1-first = Bernard|editor2-last = Raftery|editor2-first = Judith|editor3-last = Round|editor3-first = Kerrie|title = Playford's South Australia: Essays on the History of South Australia, 1933\u20131968|publisher = Association of Professional Historians|pages = 73\u201390|isbn = 978-0646290928}}</ref> More recently{{when|date=December 2018}} the nominally independent South Australian Electoral Districts Boundaries Commission has been accused of favouring the [[Australian Labor Party]], as the party has been able to form government in four of the last seven elections, despite receiving a lower two-party preferred vote.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nocookies |url=https://www.theaustralian.com/national-affairs/state-politics/liberals-blocked-by-unfair-boundaries-says-downer/story-e6frgczx-1226856356689 |work=The Australian}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Queensland]], malapportionment combined with a gerrymander under Premier Sir [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] became nicknamed the [[Bjelkemander]] in the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Orr|first1=Graham D.|last2=Levy|first2=Ron|title=Electoral Malapportionment: Partisanship, Rhetoric and Reform in the Shadow of the Agrarian Strong-Man|journal=[[Griffith Law Review]]|year=2009|volume=18|issue=3|pages=638\u2013665|ssrn=1579826|doi=10.1080/10854659.2009.10854659}}</ref> Under the system, electoral boundaries were drawn so that rural electorates had as few as half as many voters as metropolitan ones and regions with high levels of support for the opposition [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] were concentrated into fewer electorates, allowing Bjelke-Petersen's [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] (later National Party) led Coalition government to remain in power despite attracting substantially less than 50% of the vote.

When [[Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan]] were admitted to Confederation in 1905, their original district boundaries were set forth in the respective [[Alberta Act|Alberta]] and [[Saskatchewan Act]]s. Federal [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] members devised the boundaries to ensure the election of provincial Liberal governments.<ref>Breen, David. \"The Turner Thesis and the Canadian West: A Closer Look at the Ranching Frontier.\" In ''Essays on Western History.''

[[Manitoba]] was the first province to authorize a non-partisan group to define constituency boundaries in the 1950s. In 1964, the federal government delegated the drawing of boundaries for federal electoral districts to the non-partisan agency [[Elections Canada]] which answers to Parliament rather than the government of the day.\n\nAs a result, gerrymandering is not generally a major issue in Canada except at the civic level.<ref>Jim Silver, ''The Failure of Civic Reform Movements in Winnipeg Civic Elections: 1971-1992'' (Winnipeg: Institute of Urban Studies, University of Winnipeg, 1995); available at https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0537/c2f86590a76ec1d0030175806c6dee13178d.pdf</ref> Although city wards are recommended by independent agencies, city councils occasionally overrule them. That is much more likely if the city is not homogenous and different neighborhoods have sharply different opinions about city policy direction.\n\nIn 2006, a controversy arose in [[Prince Edward Island]] over the provincial government's decision to throw out an electoral map drawn by an independent commission. Instead, they created two new maps. The government adopted the second of them, which was designed by the [[caucus]] of the governing party. Opposition parties and the media attacked Premier [[Pat Binns]] for what they saw as gerrymandering of districts. Among other things, the government adopted a map that ensured that every current [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] from the premier's party had a district to run in for re-election, but in the original map, several had been redistricted.<ref>{{cite news |title=No Christmas election: Binns |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/no-christmas-election-binns-1.608298 |work=[[cbc.ca]] |date=16 November 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, in the [[2007 Prince Edward Island general election|2007 provincial election]] only seven of 20 incumbent Members of the Legislative Assembly were re-elected (seven did not run for re-election), and the government was defeated.\n\n===Chile===\n\nThe military government which ruled [[Chile]] from 1973 to 1990 was ousted in a [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|national plebiscite]] in October 1988. Opponents of General [[Augusto Pinochet]] voted NO to remove him from power and to trigger democratic elections, while supporters (mostly from the right-wing) voted YES to keep him in office for another eight years.\n\nFive months prior to the plebiscite, the regime published a law regulating future elections and referendums, but the configuration of electoral districts and the manner in which Congress seats would be awarded were only added to the law seven months after the referendum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30082&tipoVersion=0 |title=LEY-18700 06-MAY-1988 MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR |publisher=Leychile.cl |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idLey=18799 |title=LEY-18799 26-MAY-1989 MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR |publisher=Leychile.cl |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] (lower house), [[Electoral division of Chile|60 districts]] were drawn by grouping (mostly) neighboring [[Communes of Chile|communes]] (the smallest administrative subdivision in the country) within the same [[Regions of Chile|region]] (the largest).

The results of the 1988 plebiscite show that neither the \"NO\" side nor the \"YES\" side outpolled the other by said margin in any of the newly established districts.

The 1980 Constitution allocated a number of seats to appointed senators, making it harder for one side to change the Constitution by itself. The opposition won 22 senate seats in the 1989 election, taking both seats in three out of 19 constituencies, controlling 58% of the elected Senate, but only 47% of the full Senate. The unelected senators were eliminated in the 2005 constitutional reforms, but the electoral map has remained largely untouched (two new regions were created in 2007, one of which altered the composition of two senatorial constituencies; the first election to be affected by this minor change took place in 2013).\n\n===France===\nFrance is one of the few countries to let legislatures redraw the map with no check.<ref>Balinski & Ba\u00efou (2002), ''D\u00e9coupage \u00e9lectoral'', Pour la science</ref> In practice, the legislature sets up an executive commission. Districts called ''arrondissements'' were used in the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] and under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] they are called ''circonscriptions''. During the Third Republic, some reforms of arrondissements, which were also used for administrative purposes, were largely suspected to have been arranged to favor the kingmaker in the Assembly, the [[Parti radical]].\n\nThe dissolution of [[Seine (department)|Seine]] and [[Seine-et-Oise]] d\u00e9partements was seen as a case of Gerrymandering to counter communist influence around Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://21maps.com/quand-la-politique-decoupe-la-geographie|title=Quand la politique d\u00e9coupe la g\u00e9ographie \u2022 21Maps|author=|date=15 March 2018|website=21maps.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the modern regime, there were three designs: in 1958 (regime change), 1987 (by [[Charles Pasqua]]) and 2010 (by [[Alain Marleix]]), three times by conservative governments. Pasqua's drawing was known to have been particularly good at gerrymandering, resulting in 80% of the seats with 58% of the vote in [[1993 French legislative election|1993]], and forcing Socialists [[1997 French legislative election|in the 1997 snap election]] to enact multiple pacts with smaller parties in order to win again, this time as a coalition. In 2010, the Sarkozy government created 12 districts for expats.\n\nThe [[Conseil Constitutionnel|Constitutional council]] was called twice by the opposition to decide about gerrymandering, but it never considered partisan disproportions. However, it forced the Marleix committee to respect an 80\u2013120% population ratio, ending a tradition dating back to the Revolution in which ''d\u00e9partements'', however small in population, would send at least two MPs.\n\nGerrymandering in France is also done against regionalist parties. ''D\u00e9partements'' are always used even if they split urban areas or larger identity territories, and smaller identity divisions are avoided.\n\n===Germany===\nWhen the electoral districts in Germany were redrawn in 2000, the ruling center-left Social Democratic Party ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) was accused of gerrymandering to marginalize the left-wing [[Left Party (Germany)|PDS]] party. The SPD combined traditional PDS strongholds in eastern Berlin with new districts made up of more populous areas of western Berlin, where the PDS had very limited following.\n\nAfter having won four seats in Berlin in the 1998 national election, the PDS was able to retain only two seats altogether in the 2002 elections. Under German electoral law, a political party has to win either more than five percent of the votes or at least three directly elected seats, to qualify for top-up seats under the [[Additional Member System]]. The PDS vote fell below five percent thus they failed to qualify for top-up seats and were confined to just two members of the [[Bundestag]], the German federal parliament (elected representatives are always allowed to hold their seats as individuals). Had they won a third constituency, the PDS would have gained at least 25 additional seats, which would have been enough to hold the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the Bundestag.\n\nIn the election of 2005, [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (successor of the PDS) gained 8.7% of the votes and thus qualified for top-up seats.\n\n<!--Ugly paragraph and very confusing\u2014needs more explanation-->The number of Bundestag seats of parties which traditionally get over 5% of the votes cannot be affected very much by gerrymandering, because seats are awarded to these parties on a proportional basis. However, when a party wins so many districts in any one of the 16 federal states that those seats alone count for more than its proportional share of the vote in that same state does the districting have some influence on larger parties\u2014those extra seats, called \"[[Overhang seat|\u00dcberhangmandate]]\", remain. In the Bundestag election of 2009, Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU gained 24 such extra seats, while no other party gained any; this skewed the result so much that the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] issued two rulings declaring the existing election laws invalid and requiring the Bundestag to pass a new law limiting such extra seats to no more than 15. In 2013, Germany's Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of \u00dcberhangmandate, which from then on have to be added in proportion to the second vote of each party thereby making it impossible that one party can have more seats than earned by the proportionate votes in the election.\n\n===Greece===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}\nGerrymandering has been rather common in [[Greece|Greek]] history since organized parties with national ballots only appeared after the 1926 Constitution.{{clarify|reason=Why was it common if there were no parties? Also, why was there then only one case BEFORE it?|date=October 2013}} The only case before that was the creation of the Piraeus electoral district in 1906, in order to give the Theotokis party a safe district.\n\nThe most infamous case of gerrymandering{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} was in the [[1956 Greek legislative election|1956 election]]. While in previous elections the districts were based on the [[prefecture]] level (\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2),{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} for 1956 the country was split in districts of varying sizes, some being the size of prefectures, some the size of sub-prefectures (\u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) and others somewhere in between. In small districts the winning party would take all seats, in intermediate size, it would take most and there was proportional representation in the largest districts. The districts were created in such a way that small districts were those that traditionally voted for the right while large districts were those that voted against the right.\n\nThis system has become known as the three-phase (\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc) system or the [[baklava]] system (because, as baklava is split into full pieces and corner pieces, the country was also split into disproportionate pieces). The opposition, being composed of the center and the left, formed a coalition with the sole intent of changing the electoral law and then calling new elections. Even though the centrist and leftist opposition won the popular vote (1,620,007 votes against 1,594,992), the right-wing [[National Radical Union|ERE]] won the majority of seats (165 to 135) and was to lead the country for the next two years.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nIn [[Hong Kong]], functional constituencies are demarcated by the government and defined in statutes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org|title=''Legislative Council Ordinance''|work=hklii.org}}</ref> making them prone to gerrymandering.

Successive arrangements by governments of all political characters have been attacked as gerrymandering. Ireland uses the [[single transferable vote]], and as well as the actual boundaries drawn, the main tool of gerrymandering has been the number of seats per constituency used, with three-seat constituencies normally benefiting the strongest parties in an area, whereas four-seat constituencies normally help smaller parties.\n\nIn 1947 the rapid rise of new party [[Clann na Poblachta]] threatened the position of the governing party [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. The government of [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] introduced the [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1947]], which increased the size of the D\u00e1il from 138 to 147 and increased the number of three-seat constituencies from fifteen to twenty-two. The result was described by the journalist and historian [[Tim Pat Coogan]] as \"a blatant attempt at gerrymander which no [[Northern Ireland|Six County]] Unionist could have bettered.\"<ref name=\"coogan637\">Tim Pat Coogan, ''De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' (Hutchinson, London, 1993) hardback. page 637 {{ISBN|0-09-175030-X}}</ref> The following February the [[1948 Irish general election|1948 general election]] was held and Clann na Poblachta secured ten seats instead of the nineteen they would have received proportional to their vote.<ref name=\"coogan637\" />\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the Minister for Local Government, [[James Tully (Irish politician)|James Tully]], attempted to arrange the constituencies to ensure that the governing [[Fine Gael]]\u2013[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] [[Government of the 20th D\u00e1il|National Coalition]] would win a parliamentary majority. The [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974]] was planned as a major reversal of previous gerrymandering by Fianna F\u00e1il (then in opposition). Tully ensured that there were as many as possible three-seat constituencies where the governing parties were strong, in the expectation that the governing parties would each win a seat in many constituencies, relegating Fianna F\u00e1il to one out of three.\n\nIn areas where the governing parties were weak, four-seat constituencies were used so that the governing parties had a strong chance of still winning two. The election results created substantial change, as there was a larger than expected collapse in the vote. Fianna F\u00e1il won a landslide victory in the [[1977 Irish general election]], two out of three seats in many cases, relegating the National Coalition parties to fight for the last seat. Consequently, the term \"[[Tullymandering]]\" was used to describe the phenomenon of a failed attempt at gerrymandering.\n\n===Kuwait===\nFrom the years 1981 until 2005, Kuwait was divided into 25 electoral districts in order to over-represent the government's supporters (the 'tribes').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asafas.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kias/pdf/kb4_1and2/08hiramatsu.pdf|title=The Changing Nature of the Parliamentary System in Kuwait|page=63 & 70|quote=Due to the gerrymandering on the part of the government, the \"tribes\" from the 1980s onwards, came to occupy a significant number of seats in the National Assembly.}}</ref> In July 2005, a new law for electoral reforms was approved which prevented electoral gerrymandering by cutting the number of electoral districts from 25 to 5. \nThe government of Kuwait found that 5 electoral districts resulted in a powerful parliament with the majority representing the opposition. A new law was crafted by the government of Kuwait and signed by the Amir to gerrymander the districts to 10 allowing the government's supporters to regain the majority.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ulrichsen |first1=Kristian Coates |title=Kuwait: Political crisis at critical juncture |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20026581 |accessdate=1 April 2019 |publisher=BBC |date=}}</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\n{{see also|List of Malaysian electoral districts}}\nThe practice of gerrymandering has been around in the country since its independence in 1957.

For example, during the [[2013 Malaysian general election|13th General Election in 2013]], Barisan Nasional won 60% of the seats in the Malaysian Parliament despite only receiving 47% of the popular vote.<ref>{{cite news|date=9 August 2014|title=What's Malay for gerrymandering?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21611139-years-delineation-electoral-boundaries-will-determine-future-malaysian-politics-whats|newspaper=The Economist|location=Kuala Lumpur|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> Malapportionment has also been used at least since 1974, when it was observed that in one state alone (Perak), the parliamentary constituency with the most voters had more than ten times as many voters as the one with the fewest voters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ongkianming.com/2013/07/19/press-statement-malaysia-among-the-most-malapportioned-countries-in-the-world/ |title=Malaysia among the most malapportioned countries in the world |last=Yang Berhomat Dr. Ong |first=Kiang Ming MP|date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2016 }}</ref> These practices finally failed BN in the [[2018 Malaysian general election|14th General Election]] on 9 May 2018, when the opposing ''[[Pakatan Harapan]]'' (PH; English: \"Alliance of Hope\") won despite perceived efforts of gerrymandering and malapportionment from the incumbent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.nl/malaysia-election-results-details-who-won-2018-5/|title=In a historic election, Malaysia's allegedly corrupt prime minister lost to his 92-year-old former mentor who ran on behalf of a man he put in jail|date=10 May 2018|work=Business Insider|access-date=10 May 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Malta===\nThe Labour Party that won in 1981, even though the Nationalist Party got the most votes, did so because of its gerrymandering. A 1987 constitutional amendment prevented that situation from reoccurring.\n\n===Nepal===\nAfter the restoration of democracy in 1990, Nepali politics has well exercized the practice of gerrymandering with the view to take advantage in the election. It was often practiced by [[Nepali Congress]], which remained in power in most of the time. Learning from this, the reshaping of constituency was done for constituent assembly and the opposition now wins elections.\n\n===Philippines===\n[[Legislative districts of the Philippines|Congressional districts in the Philippines]] were originally based on an ordinance from the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]], which was created by the Constitutional Commission, which was ultimately based on legislative districts as they were drawn in 1907. The same constitution gave [[Congress of the Philippines]] the power to legislate new districts, either through a national redistricting bill or piecemeal redistricting per province or city. Congress has never passed a national redistricting bill since the approval of the 1987 constitution, while it has incrementally created 34 new districts, out of the 200 originally created in 1987.\n\nThis allows Congress to create new districts once a place reaches 250,000 inhabitants, the minimum required for its creation. With this, local dynasties, through congressmen, can exert influence in the district-making process by creating bills carving new districts from old ones. In time, as the population of the Philippines increases, these districts, or groups of it, will be the basis of carving new provinces out of existing ones.\n\nAn example was in [[Camarines Sur]], where two districts were divided into three districts which allegedly favors the Andaya and the Arroyo families; it caused Rolando Andaya and [[Dato Arroyo]], who would have otherwise run against each other, run in separate districts, with one district allegedly not even surpassing the 250,000-population minimum.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/558593/noynoy-hits-creation-camarines-sur-district-dato |title= Noynoy hits creation of Camarines Sur district for Dato |date=18 March 2010 |first=Aurea |last=Calica |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] later ruled that the 250,000 population minimum does not apply to an additional district in a province.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/564542/supreme-court-ruling-camsur-clears-senate |title=  Supreme Court ruling on Camsur clears Senate |date=9 April 2010 |first=Christina |last=Mendez |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> The resulting splits would later be the cause of another gerrymander, where the province would be split into a new province called [[Nueva Camarines]]; the bill was defeated in the Senate in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/06/08/13/senate-fails-pass-nueva-camarines-measure |title=Senate fails to pass Nueva Camarines measure |date=8 June 2013 |first=Christina |last=Mendez |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |publisher=ABS-CBNnews.com |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Singapore===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Singapore]] -->\nIn recent decades, critics have accused the ruling [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) of unfair electoral practices to maintain significant majorities in the [[Parliament of Singapore]].

In [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], Catholics are a majority of the population, 82,000 against 68,000; but the electoral districts have been so arranged that Unionists return sixteen as against thirteen Nationalists (one a Protestant). This Council gives to the Unionists two to one majority on its Committees, and out of fifty-two officials employs only five Catholics. In [[County Antrim|Antrim]], which has the largest Protestant majority (196,000 to 40,000), twenty-six Unionists and three Catholics are returned. Sixty officers out of sixty-five are good Unionists and Protestants.<ref>Gwynn S.L. ''The Case for Home Rule'' (1911) pp. 104\u2013105.

This meant that both the Unionist and Nationalist parties were over-represented, while the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] and [[Independent politician|Independents]] (amounting to more than 35% of the votes cast) were severely under-represented.\n\nFrom the outset, Northern Ireland had installed the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) system in order to secure fair elections in terms of proportional representation in its [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]]. After two elections under that system, [[House of Commons (Method of Voting and Redistribution of Seats) Act (Northern Ireland) 1929|in 1929]] Stormont changed the electoral system to be the same as the rest of the [[United Kingdom]]: a single-member [[first past the post]] system.

Most observers have acknowledged that the change to a single-winner system was a key factor, however, in stifling the growth of smaller political parties, such as the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] and [[Independent Unionist]]s.\n\nAfter Westminster reintroduced direct rule in 1973, it restored the single transferable vote (STV) for elections to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] in the following year, using the same definitions of constituencies as for the Westminster Parliament.

This variation has resulted from:\n\n*[[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] being favored in the Westminster Parliament with deliberately smaller electoral quotas (average electors per constituency) than those in [[England]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. This inequality was initiated by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1958, which eliminated the previous common electoral quota for the whole United Kingdom and replaced it with four separate national quotas for the respective Boundaries commissions to work to: England 69,534; Northern Ireland 67,145, Wales 58,383 and in Scotland only 54,741 electors.\n* Current rules historically favoring geographically \"natural\"{{clarify|date=April 2014}} districts, this continues to give proportionally greater representation to Wales and Scotland.\n* Population migrations, due to [[white flight]] and [[deindustrialization]] tending to decrease the number of electors in inner-city districts.\n\nUnder the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]], the [[Conservative \u2013 Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|Coalition government]] planned to review and redraw the parliamentary constituency boundaries for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]]. The review and redistricting was to be carried out by the [[boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|four UK boundary commissions]] to produce a reduction from 650 to 600 seats, and more uniform sizes, such that a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] was to have no fewer than 70,583 and no more than 80,473 electors.

The Republican Party used its control of Congress to secure the admission of more states in territories friendly to their party\u2014the admission of [[Dakota Territory]] as two states instead of one being a notable example. By the rules for representation in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], each new state carried at least three electoral votes regardless of its population.<ref>Compare a map of the United States in 1860 [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/us_terr_1860.jpg] with a map from 1870 [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/us_terr_1870.jpg]. <!-- These images need to be put in wikimedia commons, rather than external links--></ref>\n\nAll redistricting in the United States has been contentious because it has been controlled by political parties vying for power. As a consequence of the decennial [[census]] required by the [[United States Constitution]], districts for members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] typically need to be redrawn whenever the number of members in a state changes. In many states, state legislatures redraw boundaries for state legislative districts at the same time.\n\nState legislatures have used gerrymandering along racial lines both to decrease and increase minority representation in state governments and congressional delegations. In Ohio, a conversation between Republican officials was recorded that demonstrated that redistricting was being done to aid their political candidates. Furthermore, the discussions assessed the race of voters as a factor in redistricting, on the premise that African-Americans tend to back Democratic candidates. Republicans apparently removed approximately 13,000 African-American voters from the district of [[Jim Raussen]], a Republican candidate for the House of Representatives, in an attempt to tip the scales in what was once a competitive district for Democratic candidates.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wcpo.com/wcpo/localshows/iteam/cdd905.html |title=Republican Party Politics (Part II) |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[WCPO]] |date=29 April 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515112805/http://www.wcpo.com/wcpo/localshows/iteam/cdd905.html |archivedate=15 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWith the Civil Rights Movement and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], federal enforcement and protections of suffrage for all citizens were enacted. Gerrymandering for the purpose of reducing the political influence of a racial or ethnic minority group was prohibited. After the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, some states created \"majority-minority\" districts to enhance minority voting strength. This practice, also called \"affirmative gerrymandering\", was supposed to redress historic discrimination and ensure that ethnic minorities would gain some seats and representation in government. In some states, bipartisan gerrymandering is the norm. State legislators from both parties sometimes agree to draw congressional district boundaries in a way that ensures the re-election of most or all incumbent representatives from both parties.<ref>{{cite news|title=In Virginia, an incumbent protection plan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-virginia-an-incumbent-protection-plan/2013/09/27/0e08acfc-27c0-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html|accessdate=21 April 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=29 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nRather than allowing more political influence, some states have shifted redistricting authority from politicians and given it to non-partisan [[redistricting commission]]s.

When the party controlling the districting process has a statewide majority, packing is usually not necessary to attain partisan advantage; the minority party can generally be \"cracked\" everywhere. Packing is therefore more likely to be used for partisan advantage when the party controlling the districting process has a statewide minority, because by forfeiting a few districts packed with the opposition, cracking can be used in forming the remaining districts.\n* \"Hijacking\" redraws two districts in such a way as to force two incumbents to run against each other in one district, ensuring that one of them will be eliminated.<ref name=\"ProP201111022\" />\n* \"Kidnapping\" moves an incumbent's home address into another district.<ref name=\"ProP201111022\" /> Reelection can become more difficult when the incumbent no longer resides in the district, or possibly faces reelection from a new district with a new voter base. This is often employed against politicians who represent multiple urban areas, in which larger cities will be removed from the district in order to make the district more rural.\n\nThese tactics are typically combined in some form, creating a few \"forfeit\" seats for packed voters of one type in order to secure more seats and greater representation for voters of another type. This results in candidates of one party (the one responsible for the gerrymandering) winning by small majorities in most of the districts, and another party winning by a large majority in only a few of the districts.\n\n==Effects==\n\nGerrymandering is effective because of the [[wasted vote|wasted vote effect]]. ''Wasted votes'' are votes that did not contribute to electing a candidate, either because they were in excess of the bare minimum needed for victory or because the candidate lost. By moving geographic boundaries, the incumbent party packs opposition voters into a few districts they will already win, wasting the extra votes. Other districts are more tightly constructed with the opposition party allowed a bare minority count, thereby wasting all the minority votes for the losing candidate. These districts constitute the majority of districts and are drawn to produce a result favoring the incumbent party.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/231865/gerrymandering|title=gerrymandering - politics|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nA quantitative measure of the effect of gerrymandering is the [[efficiency gap]], computed from the difference in the wasted votes for two different political parties summed over all the districts.<ref name=\"82UofCLawReview\">{{Cite journal|last=Stephanopoulos|first=Nicholas|last2=McGhee|first2=Eric|year=2014|title=Partisan Gerrymandering and the Efficiency Gap|journal=University of Chicago Law Review|volume=82|page=831|ssrn=2457468}}</ref><ref name=\"NewRepublic20140702\">{{Cite magazine|last=Stephanopoulos|first=Nicholas|date=2 July 2014|title=Here's How We Can End Gerrymandering Once and for All|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118534/gerrymandering-efficiency-gap-better-way-measure-gerrymandering|magazine=The New Republic|access-date=22 November 2016}}</ref>  Citing in part an efficiency gap of 11.69% to 13%, a U.S. District Court in 2016 ruled against the 2011 drawing of Wisconsin legislative districts.

To minimize the risk of demographic or political shifts swinging a district to the opposition, politicians can create more packed districts, leading to more comfortable margins in unpacked ones.\n\n===Effect on electoral competition===\n\n[[File:Gerrymandering 9-6.png|thumb|How gerrymandering can influence electoral results on a [[Voting system#Nonproportional and semiproportional methods|non-proportional system]].

Some say that, rather than packing the voters of their party into uncompetitive districts, party leaders tend to prefer to spread their party's voters into multiple districts, so that their party can win a larger number of races.<ref>Seth E. Masket, Jonathan Winburn and Gerald C. Wright, [https://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=8469145&fulltextType=RA&fileId=S1049096511001703 The Gerrymanderers Are Coming! Legislative Redistricting Won't Affect Competition or Polarization Much, No Matter Who Does It].</ref> (See scenario '''(c)''' in the box.) This may lead to increased competition. Instead of gerrymandering, some researchers find that other factors, such as partisan polarization and the incumbency advantage, have driven the recent decreases in electoral competition.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forgette|first1=Richard|last2=Winkle|first2=John W.|date=March 2006|title=Partisan Gerrymandering and the Voting Rights Act*|journal=Social Science Quarterly|volume=87|issue=1|pages=155\u2013173|doi=10.1111/j.0038-4941.2006.00374.x}}</ref> Similarly, a 2009 study found that \"congressional polarization is primarily a function of the differences in how Democrats and Republicans represent the same districts rather than a function of which districts each party represents or the distribution of constituency preferences.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McCarty|first1=Nolan|last2=Poole|first2=Keith T.|last3=Rosenthal|first3=Howard|date=July 2009|title=Does Gerrymandering Cause Polarization?|url=http://www.hss.caltech.edu/~miaryc/PEW/Nolan_McCarty_PEWCaltech.pdf|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=53|issue=3|pages=666\u2013680|citeseerx=10.1.1.491.3072|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2009.00393.x}}</ref>\n\nThese findings are, however, a matter of some dispute. While gerrymandering may not decrease electoral competition in all cases, there are certainly instances where gerrymandering does reduce such competition.\n\nOne state in which gerrymandering has arguably had an adverse effect on electoral competition is California. In 2000, a bipartisan redistricting effort redrew congressional district lines in ways that all but guaranteed incumbent victories; as a result, California saw only one congressional seat change hands between 2000 and 2010. In response to this obvious gerrymandering, a 2010 referendum in California gave the power to redraw congressional district lines to the [[California Citizens Redistricting Commission]], which had been created to draw California State Senate and Assembly districts by another referendum in 2008. In stark contrast to the redistricting efforts that followed the 2000 census, the redistricting commission has created a number of the most competitive congressional districts in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/14/us/california-congressional-delegation-braces-for-change.html|title=New Faces Set For California in the Capitol|last=Nagourney|first=Adam|date=14 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>\n\n===Increased incumbent advantage and campaign costs===\nThe effect of gerrymandering for incumbents is particularly advantageous, as incumbents are far more likely to be reelected under conditions of gerrymandering. For example, in 2002, according to political scientists [[Norman Ornstein]] and [[Thomas E. Mann|Thomas Mann]], only four challengers were able to defeat incumbent members of the U.S. Congress, the lowest number in modern American history.<ref name=\"7_buck_trust.html\">{{cite web|url=http://www.centrists.org/pages/2004/07/7_buck_trust.html|title=Iowa's Redistricting Process: An Example of the Right Way to Draw Legislative|date=22 July 2004|publisher=Centrists.Org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107114029/http://www.centrists.org/pages/2004/07/7_buck_trust.html|archivedate=7 November 2009|accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref> Incumbents are likely to be of the majority party orchestrating a gerrymander, and incumbents are usually easily renominated in subsequent elections, including incumbents among the minority.\n\nMann, a Senior Fellow of Governance Studies at the [[Brookings Institution]], has also noted that \"Redistricting is a deeply political process, with incumbents actively seeking to minimize the risk to themselves (via bipartisan gerrymanders) or to gain additional seats for their party (via partisan gerrymanders)\".<ref>Mann, Thomas E. \"Redistricting Reform.\" The Brookings Institution. Brookings.edu, 1 June 2005. Web. 5 February 2013. <http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2005/06/01politics-mann></ref> The bipartisan gerrymandering that Mann mentions refers to the fact that legislators often also draw distorted legislative districts even when such redistricting does not provide an advantage to their party.\n\nGerrymandering of state legislative districts can effectively guarantee an incumbent's victory by 'shoring up' a district with higher levels of partisan support, without disproportionately benefiting a particular political party. This can be highly problematic from a governance perspective, because forming districts to ensure high levels of partisanship often leads to higher levels of partisanship in legislative bodies. If a substantial number of districts are designed to be polarized, then those districts' representation will also likely act in a heavily partisan manner, which can create and perpetuate partisan gridlock.\n\nThis demonstrates that gerrymandering can have a deleterious effect on the principle of democratic accountability. With uncompetitive seats/districts reducing the fear that incumbent politicians may lose office, they have less incentive to represent the interests of their constituents, even when those interests conform to majority support for an issue across the electorate as a whole.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Incumbent politicians may look out more for their party's interests than for those of their constituents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}\n\nGerrymandering can affect campaign costs for district elections. If districts become increasingly stretched out, candidates must pay increased costs for transportation and trying to develop and present [[campaign advertising]] across a district.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ced.org/reports/solving-the-problem-of-partisan-gerrymandering|title=Let the Voters Choose|last=CED|first=|date=13 March 2018|work=Committee for Economic Development|access-date=7 June 2019}}</ref> The incumbent's advantage in securing campaign funds is another benefit of his or her having a gerrymandered secure seat.\n\n===Less descriptive representation===\nGerrymandering also has significant effects on the [[representation (politics)|representation]] received by voters in gerrymandered districts. Because gerrymandering can be designed to increase the number of wasted votes among the electorate, the relative representation of particular groups can be drastically altered from their actual share of the voting population. This effect can significantly prevent a gerrymandered system from achieving proportional and [[descriptive representation]], as the winners of elections are increasingly determined by who is drawing the districts rather than the preferences of the voters.\n\nGerrymandering may be advocated to improve representation within the legislature among otherwise underrepresented minority groups by packing them into a single district. This can be controversial, as it may lead to those groups' remaining marginalised in the government as they become confined to a single district. Candidates outside that district no longer need to represent them to win elections.\n\nAs an example, much of the redistricting conducted in the United States in the early 1990s involved the intentional creation of additional \"majority-minority\" districts where racial minorities such as African Americans were packed into the majority. This \"maximization policy\" drew support by both the Republican Party (who had limited support among African Americans and could concentrate their power elsewhere) and by minority representatives elected as Democrats from these constituencies, who then had safe seats. <!-- cite a famous politician or political scientist that has a good quote of this here -->\n\nThe 2012 election provides a number of examples as to how partisan gerrymandering can adversely affect the descriptive function of states' congressional delegations. In Pennsylvania, for example, Democratic candidates for the House of Representatives received 83,000 more votes than Republican candidates, yet the Republican-controlled redistricting process in 2010 resulted in Democrats losing to their Republican counterparts in 13 out of Pennsylvania's 18 districts.<ref>Ting, Jan C. \"Boehner and House Republicans Lack Mandate to Oppose Obama.\" NewsWorks.

Web. 5 February 2013.\n[https://whyy.org/articles/boehner-and-house-republicans-lack-mandate-to-oppose-obama/]\n</ref>\n\nIn the seven states where Republicans had complete control over the redistricting process, Republican House candidates received 16.7 million votes and Democratic House candidates received 16.4 million votes. The redistricting resulted in Republican victories in 73 out of the 107 affected seats; in those 7 states, Republicans received 50.4% of the votes but won in over 68% of the congressional districts.<ref>Wang, Sam. \"The Great Gerrymander of 2012.\" The New York Times. 2 February 2013.

If only a Democratic landslide were needed, why wouldn't a majority vote do the trick? I think editor means \"landslide in the respective cities to offset the outlying vote.\"|date=December 2014}}\n\n===Incumbent gerrymandering===\nGerrymandering can also be done to help incumbents as a whole, effectively turning every district into a packed one and greatly reducing the potential for competitive elections. This is particularly likely to occur when the minority party has significant obstruction power\u2014unable to enact a partisan gerrymander, the legislature instead agrees on ensuring their own mutual reelection.\n\nIn an unusual occurrence in 2000, for example, the two dominant parties in the state of California [[Redistricting in California|cooperatively redrew]] both state and Federal legislative districts to preserve the status quo, ensuring the electoral safety of the politicians from unpredictable voting by the electorate. This move proved completely effective, as no State or Federal legislative office changed party in the [[2004 U.S. House election|2004 election]], although 53 congressional, 20 state senate, and 80 state assembly seats were potentially at risk.\n\nIn 2006, the term \"70/30 District\" came to signify the equitable split of two evenly split (i.e. 50/50) districts. The resulting districts gave each party a guaranteed seat and retained their respective power base.\n\n===Prison-based gerrymandering===\nPrison-based gerrymandering occurs when prisoners are counted as residents of a particular district, increasing the district's population with non-voters when assigning political apportionment. This phenomenon violates the principle of [[one person, one vote]] because, although many prisoners come from (and return to) urban communities, they are counted as \"residents\" of the rural districts that contain large prisons, thereby artificially inflating the political representation in districts with prisons at the expense of voters in all other districts without prisons.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/news/2006/05/20/NYT-gerrymandering|title=Prison-Based Gerrymandering|date=20 May 2006|newspaper=The New York Times|type=Editorial}}</ref> Others contend that prisoners should not be counted as residents of their original districts when they do not reside there and are [[disenfranchisement|not legally eligible to vote]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A9710-D.html|title=New York Prison-Based Gerrymandering Bill|last=Initiative|first=Prison Policy|date=|website=www.prisonersofthecensus.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prisonersofthecensus.org/NYS_A11597.html|title=New York Prison-Based Gerrymandering Technical Amendment|last=Initiative|first=Prison Policy|date=|website=www.prisonersofthecensus.org}}</ref>\n\n==Changes to achieve competitive elections==\n[[File:map22007.gif|thumb|250px|Electoral divisions in the Sydney area, drawn by the politically independent [[Australian Electoral Commission]]]]\nDue to the perceived issues associated with gerrymandering and its effect on competitive elections and democratic accountability, numerous countries have enacted reforms making the practice either more difficult or less effective. Countries such as the U.K., Australia, Canada and most of those in Europe have transferred responsibility for defining constituency boundaries to neutral or cross-party bodies. In Spain, they are constitutionally fixed since 1978.<ref name=\"ES_Const\" />\n\nIn the United States, however, such reforms are controversial and frequently meet particularly strong opposition from groups that benefit from gerrymandering. In a more neutral system, they might lose considerable influence.\n\n=== Redistricting by neutral or cross-party agency ===\nThe most commonly advocated electoral reform proposal targeted at gerrymandering is to change the redistricting process. Under these proposals, an independent and presumably objective commission is created specifically for redistricting, rather than having the legislature do it.\n\nThis is the system used in the United Kingdom, where the independent [[boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|boundary commissions]] determine the boundaries for [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] and the [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolved legislatures]], subject to ratification by the body in question (almost always granted without debate). A similar situation exists in Australia where the independent [[Australian Electoral Commission]] and its state-based counterparts determine electoral boundaries for federal, state and local jurisdictions.\n\nTo help ensure neutrality, members of a redistricting agency may be appointed from relatively apolitical sources such as retired judges or longstanding members of the civil service, possibly with requirements for adequate representation among competing political parties. Additionally, members of the board can be denied access to information that might aid in gerrymandering, such as the demographic makeup or voting patterns of the population.\n\nAs a further constraint, [[consensus]] requirements can be imposed to ensure that the resulting district map reflects a wider perception of fairness, such as a requirement for a supermajority approval of the commission for any district proposal. Consensus requirements, however, can lead to deadlock, such as occurred in [[Missouri]] following the 2000 census. There, the equally numbered partisan appointees were unable to reach consensus in a reasonable time, and consequently the courts had to determine district lines.\n\nIn the U.S. state of [[Iowa]], the nonpartisan Legislative Services Bureau (LSB, akin to the [[U.S. Congressional Research Service]]) determines boundaries of electoral districts. Aside from satisfying federally mandated contiguity and population equality criteria, the LSB mandates unity of counties and cities. Consideration of political factors such as location of incumbents, previous boundary locations, and political party proportions is specifically forbidden. Since Iowa's counties are chiefly regularly shaped [[polygons]], the LSB process has led to districts that follow county lines.<ref name=\"7_buck_trust.html\" />\n\nIn 2005, the U.S. state of [[Ohio]] had a ballot measure to create an independent commission whose first priority was competitive districts, a sort of \"reverse gerrymander\". A complex mathematical formula was to be used to determine the competitiveness of a district. The measure failed voter approval chiefly due to voter concerns that communities of interest would be broken up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/2005/11/08/oh/state/issue/4/|title=Issue 4: Independent Redistricting Process \u2013 Ohio State Government|date=|publisher=Smartvoter.org|accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the [[Open Our Democracy Act of 2017]] was submitted to the [[United States House of Representatives|US House of Representatives]] by [[John Delaney (Maryland politician)|Rep.

The merit of increasing transparency in redistricting processes is based largely on the premise that lawmakers would be less inclined to draw gerrymandered districts if they were forced to defend such districts in a public forum.\n\n===Changing the voting system===\nBecause gerrymandering relies on the [[wasted vote|wasted-vote effect]], the use of a different voting system with fewer wasted votes can help reduce gerrymandering. In particular, the use of [[multimember district|multi-member districts]] alongside voting systems establishing proportional representation such as [[Single Transferable Voting|single transferable voting]] can reduce wasted votes and gerrymandering. Semi-proportional voting systems such as [[single non-transferable vote]] or [[cumulative voting]] are relatively simple and similar to ''first past the post'' and can also reduce the proportion of wasted votes and thus potential gerrymandering. Electoral reformers have advocated all three as replacement systems.<ref>See, e.g., Richard L. Engstrom, The Single Transferable Vote: An Alternative Remedy for Minority Vote Dilution, 27 U.S.F.L.Rev. 781, 806 (1993) (arguing that the Single Transferable Voting systems maintain minority electoral opportunities); Steven J. Mulroy, Alternative Ways Out: A Remedial Road Map for the Use of Alternative Electoral Systems as Voting Rights Act Remedies, 77 N.C.L.Rev. 1867, 1923 (1999) (concluding that ranked-ballot voting systems avoid minority vote dilution); Steven J. Mulroy, The Way Out: A Legal Standard for Imposing Alternative Electoral Systems as Voting Rights Remedies, 33 Harv.C.R.-C.L.L.Rev. 333, 350 (1998) (arguing that preferential voting systems enhance minority representation); and Alexander Athan Yanos, Note, Reconciling the Right to Vote With the Voting Rights Act, 92 Colum.L.Rev. 1810, 1865\u201366 (1992) (arguing that Single Transferable Voting serves to preserve the minority party's right to representation).</ref>\n\nElectoral systems with various forms of proportional representation are now found in nearly all European countries, resulting in multi-party systems (with many parties represented in the parliaments) with higher voter attendance in the elections,<ref>{{Citation|last1=Pintor|first1=Rafael L\u00f3pez|title=Voter Turnout Rates from a Comparative Perspective|url=http://www.idea.int/publications/vt/upload/Voter%20turnout.pdf|accessdate=7 March 2014|last2=Gratschew|first2=Maria|last3=Sullivan|first3=Kate}}</ref> fewer wasted votes, and a wider variety of political opinions represented.\n\nElectoral systems with election of just one winner in each district (i.e., \"winner-takes-all\" electoral systems) and no proportional distribution of extra mandates to smaller parties tend to create two-party systems ([[Duverger's law]]). In these, just two parties effectively compete in the national elections and thus the national political discussions are forced into a narrow two-party frame, where loyalty and forced statements inside the two parties distort the political debate.{{According to whom|date=October 2013}}\n\n===Changing the size of districts and the elected body===\nIf a proportional or semi-proportional voting system is used then increasing the number of winners in any given district will reduce the number of wasted votes. This can be accomplished both by merging separate districts together and by increasing the total size of the body to be elected. Since gerrymandering relies on exploiting the wasted vote effect, increasing the number of winners per district can reduce the potential for gerrymandering in proportional systems. Unless all districts are merged, however, this method cannot eliminate gerrymandering entirely.\n\nIn contrast to proportional methods, if a nonproportional voting system with multiple winners (such as [[plurality-at-large voting|block voting]]) is used, then increasing the size of the elected body while keeping the number of districts constant will not reduce the amount of wasted votes, leaving the potential for gerrymandering the same. While merging districts together under such a system can reduce the potential for gerrymandering, doing so also amplifies the tendency of block voting to produce [[landslide victory|landslide victories]], creating a similar effect to gerrymandering by concentrating wasted votes among the opposition and denying them representation.\n\nIf a system of single-winner elections is used, then increasing the size of the elected body will implicitly increase the number of districts to be created. This change can actually make gerrymandering easier when raising the number of single-winner elections, as opposition groups can be more efficiently packed into smaller districts without accidentally including supporters, further increasing the number of wasted votes amongst the opposition.\n\n===Using fixed districts===\nAnother way to avoid gerrymandering is simply to stop redistricting altogether and use existing political boundaries such as state, county, or provincial lines. While this prevents future gerrymandering, any existing advantage may become deeply ingrained. The [[United States Senate]], for instance, has more competitive elections than the House of Representatives due to the use of existing state borders rather than gerrymandered districts\u2014Senators are elected by their entire state, while Representatives are elected in legislatively drawn districts.\n\nThe use of fixed districts creates an additional problem, however, in that fixed districts do not take into account changes in population. Individual voters can come to have very different degrees of influence on the legislative process. This [[malapportionment]] can greatly affect representation after long periods of time or large population movements. In the United Kingdom during the [[Industrial Revolution]], several constituencies that had been fixed since they gained representation in the Parliament of England became so small that they could be won with only a handful of voters (''[[rotten borough]]s''). Similarly, in the U.S. the state legislature of Alabama refused to redistrict for more than 60 years, despite major changes in population patterns. By 1960 less than a quarter of the state's population controlled the majority of seats in the legislature.<ref>Dr. Michael McDonald, U.S. Elections Project: Alabama Redistricting Summary [http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm Dept. of Public and International Affairs George Mason University]. Retrieved 6 April 2008. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080624024455/http://elections.gmu.edu/Redistricting/AL.htm|date=24 June 2008}}</ref> However, this practice of using fixed districts for state legislatures was effectively banned in the United States after the ''[[Reynolds v. Sims]]'' Supreme Court decision in 1964, establishing a rule of [[one man, one vote]].\n\n===Objective rules to create districts===\nAnother means to reduce gerrymandering is to create objective, precise criteria to which any district map must comply. Courts in the United States, for instance, have ruled that congressional districts must be contiguous in order to be constitutional.<ref>[[wikisource:Reynolds v. Sims|Reynolds v. Sims]] states that \"a state legislative apportionment scheme may properly give representation to various political subdivisions and provide for compact districts of contiguous territory if substantial equality among districts is maintained.\" See also [[Reynolds v. Sims|the Wikipedia article]].</ref> This, however, is not a particularly binding constraint, as very narrow strips of land with few or no voters in them may be used to connect separate regions for inclusion in one district, as is the case in [[Illinois's 4th congressional district]].\n\nDepending on the distribution of voters for a particular party, metrics that maximize compactness can be opposed to metrics that minimize the efficiency gap.  For example, in the United States, voters registered with the Democratic Party tend to be concentrated in cities, potentially resulting in a large number of \"wasted\" votes if compact districts are drawn around city populations.  Neither of these metrics take into consideration other possible goals,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/hating-gerrymandering-is-easy-fixing-it-is-harder/|title=Hating Gerrymandering Is Easy. Fixing It Is Harder.|last=Wasserman|first=David|date=25 January 2018|website=fivethirtyeight.com}}</ref> such as proportional representation based on other demographic characteristics (such as race, ethnicity, gender, or income), maximizing competitiveness of elections (the greatest number of districts where party affiliation is 50/50), avoiding splits of existing government units (like cities and counties), and ensuring representation of major interest groups (like farmers or voters in a specific transportation corridor), though any of these could be incorporated into a more complicated metric.\n\n====Minimum district to convex polygon ratio====\nOne method is to define a minimum district to [[convex polygon]] ratio {{Definition needed|date=July 2016}} . To use this method, every proposed district is circumscribed by the smallest possible convex polygon (its [[convex hull]]; think of stretching a rubberband around the outline of the district). Then, the area of the district is divided{{elucidate|date=December 2015}} by the area of the polygon; or, if at the edge of the state, by the portion of the area of the polygon within state boundaries.\n[[File:GeorgiaDistricts8and10.png|frame|right|Minimal convex polygon, showing how to rate district shape irregularity.]]\nThe advantages of this method are that it allows a certain amount of human intervention to take place (thus solving the Colorado problem of [[#Shortest splitline algorithm|splitline districting]]); it allows the borders of the district to follow existing jagged subdivisions, such as neighbourhoods or voting districts (something isoperimetric rules would discourage); and it allows concave coastline districts, such as the Florida gulf coast area. It would mostly eliminate bent districts, but still permit long, straight ones. However, since human intervention is still allowed, the gerrymandering issues of packing and cracking would still occur, just to a lesser extent.\n\n====Shortest splitline algorithm====\nThe [[Center for Range Voting]] has proposed<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org/GerryExamples.html|title=Gerrymandering and a cure\u2014shortest splitline algorithm|date=|publisher=RangeVoting.org|accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref> a way to draw districts by a simple [[algorithm]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org|title=RangeVoting.org \u2013 Center for Range Voting}}</ref> The algorithm uses only the shape of the state, the number N of districts wanted, and the population distribution as inputs. The algorithm (slightly simplified) is:\n\n# Start with the boundary outline of the state.\n# Let N=A+B where N is the number of districts to create, and A and B are two whole numbers, either equal (if N is even) or differing by exactly one (if N is odd). For example, if N is 10, each of A and B would be 5. If N is 7, A would be 4 and B would be 3.\n# Among all possible straight lines that split the state into two parts with the population ratio A:B, choose the ''shortest''. If there are two or more such shortest lines, choose the one that is most north-south in direction; if there is still more than one possibility, choose the westernmost.\n# We now have two hemi-states, each to contain a specified number (namely A and B) of districts. Handle them recursively via the same splitting procedure.\n# Any human residence that is split in two or more parts by the resulting lines is considered to be a part of the most north-eastern of the resulting districts; if this doesn't decide it, then of the most northern.\n\nThis district-drawing algorithm has the advantages of simplicity, ultra-low cost, a single possible result (thus no possibility of human interference), lack of intentional bias, and it produces simple boundaries that do not meander needlessly. It has the disadvantage of ignoring geographic features such as rivers, cliffs, and highways and cultural features such as tribal boundaries. This landscape oversight causes it to produce districts different from those a human would produce. Ignoring geographic features can induce very simple boundaries.\n\nWhile most districts produced by the method will be fairly compact and either roughly rectangular or triangular, some of the resulting districts can still be long and narrow strips (or triangles) of land.\n\nLike most automatic redistricting rules, the shortest splitline algorithm will fail to create majority-minority districts, for both ethnic and political minorities, if the minority populations are not very compact. This might reduce minority representation.\n\nAnother criticism of the system is that splitline districts sometimes divide and diffuse the voters in a large metropolitan area. This condition is most likely to occur when one of the first splitlines cuts through the metropolitan area. It is often considered a drawback of the system because residents of the same agglomeration are assumed to be a community of common interest. This is most evident in the splitline allocation of [[Colorado]].<ref>http://www.rangevoting.org/SSHR/co_final.png</ref>\n\nAs of July 2007, shortest-splitline redistricting pictures, based on the results of the 2000 census, are available for all 50 states.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.RangeVoting.org/SplitLR.html|title=Splitline districtings of all 50 states + DC + PR|date=|publisher=RangeVoting.org|accessdate=5 August 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Minimum isoperimetric quotient====\n{{See also|Compactness measure of a shape|Polsby\u2013Popper test}}\nIt is possible to define a specific minimum [[Isoperimetric inequality|isoperimetric quotient]],<ref name=\"siam.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.siam.org/pdf/news/1237.pdf|title=James Case \"Flagrant Gerrymandering: Help from the Isoperimetric Theorem?\"|date=|accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref> proportional to the ratio between the area and the square of the perimeter of any given congressional voting district. Although technologies presently exist to define districts in this manner, there are no rules in place mandating their use, and no national movement to implement such a policy. One problem with the simplest version of this rule is that it would prevent incorporation of jagged natural boundaries, such as rivers or mountains; when such boundaries are required, such as at the edge of a state, certain districts may not be able to meet the required minima. One way of avoiding this problem is to allow districts which share a border with a state border to replace that border with a polygon or semi-circle enclosing the state boundary as a kind of virtual boundary definition, but using the actual perimeter of the district whenever this occurs inside the state boundaries. Enforcing a minimum isoperimetric quotient would encourage districts with a high ratio between area and perimeter.<ref name=\"siam.org\" />\n\n====Efficiency gap calculation====\n{{see also|Wasted vote#Efficiency gap}}\nThe efficiency gap is a simply-calculable measure that can show the effects of gerrymandering.<ref name=\"TheNewRepublic\">{{cite journal|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/118534/gerrymandering-efficiency-gap-better-way-measure-gerrymandering|title=Here's How We Can End Gerrymandering Once and for All|journal=The New Republic|author=Nicholas Stephanopoulas|date=3 July 2014|accessdate=8 May 2018}}</ref> It measures wasted votes for each party: the sum of votes cast in losing districts (losses due to cracking) and excess votes cast in winning districts (losses due to packing).  The difference in these wasted votes are divided by total votes cast, and the resulting percentage is the efficiency gap.\n\n==Use of databases and computer technology==\n{{See also|Geographic information system}}\nThe introduction of modern computers alongside the development of elaborate [[voter database]]s and special districting software has made gerrymandering a far more precise science. Using such databases, political parties can obtain detailed information about every household including political party registration, previous campaign donations, and the number of times residents voted in previous elections and combine it with other predictors of voting behavior such as age, income, race, or education level. With this data, gerrymandering politicians can predict the voting behavior of each potential district with an astonishing degree of precision, leaving little chance for creating an accidentally competitive district.\n\nOn the other hand, the introduction of modern computers would let the United States Census Bureau to calculate more equal populations in every voting district that are based only on districts being the most compact and equal populations. This could be done easily using their Block Centers based on the Global Positioning System rather than street addresses.  With this data, gerrymandering politicians will not be in charge, thus allowing competitive districts again.\n\nOnline web apps such as [[Dave's Redistricting]] have allowed users to simulate redistricting states into legislative districts as they wish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gardow.com/davebradlee/default.html|title=Dave Bradlee|last1=Bradlee|first1=Dave|website=Gardow.com|accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/the-great-gerrymander-of-2012.html|title=The Great Gerrymander of 2012|last1=Wang|first1=Sam|accessdate=3 September 2018|website=The New York Times}}</ref> According to Bradlee, the software was designed to \"put power in people's hands,\" and so that they \"can see how the process works, so it's a little less mysterious than it was 10 years ago.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-03-21-redistricting21_ST_N.htm|title=Technology allows citizens to be part of redistricting process|last1=Korte|first1=Gregory|website=USA Today|accessdate=3 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Markov chain Monte Carlo|Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)]] can measure the extent to which redistricting plans favor a particular party or group in election, and can support automated redistricting simulators.<ref name=\"B Fifield, M Higgins, K Imai, A Tarr, 2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Fifield|first1=B.|last2=Higgins|first2=M.|last3=Imai|first3=K.|last4=Tarr|first4=A.|date=2015|title=A new automated redistricting simulator using markov chain monte carlo|url=https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/redist|type=Working Paper}}</ref>\n\n==Voting systems==\n\n===First-past-the-post===\nGerrymandering is most likely to emerge, in majoritarian systems, where the country is divided into several voting districts and the candidate with the most votes wins the district. If the ruling party is in charge of drawing the district lines, it can abuse the fact that in a majoritarian system all votes that do not go to the winning candidate are essentially irrelevant to the composition of a new government. Even though, Gerrymandering can be used in other voting systems, it has the most significant impact on voting outcomes in first-past-the-post systems.<ref>{{cite web |title=Majoritarian electoral systems are more prone to gerrymandering than proportional systems |url=http://www.democraticaudit.com/2016/06/01/majoritarian-electoral-systems-are-more-prone-to-gerrymandering-than-proportional-systems/ |website=Democratic Audit |date=1 June 2016}}</ref> Partisan redrawing of district lines is particularly harmful to democratic principles in majoritarian two-party systems. In general, two party systems tend to be more polarized than proportional systems.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Feuerherd |first1=Peter |title=Is Gerrymandering to Blame for Our Polarized Politics? |url=https://daily.jstor.org/is-gerrymandering-to-blame-for-our-polarized-politics/ |website=JSTOR Daily |date=19 March 2018}}</ref> Possible consequences of Gerrymandering in such a system can be an amplification of polarization in politics and a lack of representation of minorities, as a large part of the constituency is not represented in policy making. However, not every state using a first-past-the-post system is being confronted with the negative impacts of gerrymandering. Some countries, such as Australia, Canada and the UK, authorize non-partisan organizations to set constituency boundaries in attempt to prevent gerrymandering.<ref>{{cite web |title=Solving the Problem of Partisan Gerrymandering |url=https://www.ced.org/reports/solving-the-problem-of-partisan-gerrymandering |website=Committee for Economic Development of The Conference Board |publisher=CED |accessdate=2019-05-15}}</ref>\n\n===Proportional systems===\nThe introduction of a proportional system is often proposed as the most effective solution to partisan gerrymandering.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yglesias |first1=Matthew |title=The real fix for gerrymandering is proportional representation |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/10/11/16453512/gerrymandering-proportional-representation |website=Vox |accessdate=2019-05-15 |date=11 October 2017}}</ref> In such systems the entire constituency is being represented proportionally to their votes. Even though, voting districts can be part of a proportional system, the redrawing of district lines would not benefit a party, as those districts are mainly of organizational value.\n\n===Mixed systems===\nIn mixed systems that use proportional and majoritarian voting principles, the usage of gerrymandering is a constitutional obstacle that states have to deal with.  However, in mixed systems the advantage a political actor can potentially gain from redrawing district lines is much less than in majoritarian systems. In mixed systems voting districts are mostly being used to avoid that elected parliamentarians are getting too detached from their constituency. The principle which determines the representation in parliament is usually the proportional aspect of the voting system. Seats in parliament are being allocated to each party in accordance to the proportion of their overall votes. In most mixed systems, winning a voting district merely means that a candidate is guaranteed a seat in parliament, but does not expand a party\u2019s share in the overall seats.<ref>{{cite document |last1=Wattenberg |first1=Martin P. |last2=Shugart |first2=Matthew Soberg |title=Mixed\u2010Member Electoral Systems: A Definition and Typology |date=6 February 2003 |doi=10.1093/019925768X.001.0001 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780191600241 }}</ref>  However, gerrymandering can still be used to manipulate the outcome in voting districts. In most, democracies with a mixed system, non-partisan institutions are in charge of drawing district lines and therefore Gerrymandering is a less common phenomenon.\n\n==Difference from malapportionment==\n\nGerrymandering should not be confused with [[malapportionment]], whereby the number of eligible voters per elected representative can vary widely without relation to how the boundaries are drawn. Nevertheless, the ''-mander'' suffix has been applied to particular malapportionments. Sometimes political representatives use both gerrymandering and malapportionment to try to maintain power.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/gerrymandering|title=gerrymandering {{!}} politics|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=27 May 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Barasch|first=Emily|title=The Twisted History of Gerrymandering in American Politics|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/09/the-twisted-history-of-gerrymandering-in-american-politics/262369/|magazine=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=27 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Examples==\nSeveral western democracies, notably the [[Netherlands]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Slovenia]] employ an electoral system with only one (nationwide) voting district for election of national representatives.

The number of representatives for each district can change after a census due to population shifts, but their boundaries do not change. This also effectively eliminates gerrymandering.\n\nAdditionally, many countries where the president is directly elected by the citizens (e.g. [[France]], [[Poland]], among others) use only one electoral district for presidential election, despite using multiple districts to elect representatives.\n\n===Bahamas===\n[[1962 Bahamian general election]]\n\n===Australia===\nGerrymandering has not typically been considered a problem in the [[Electoral system of Australia|Australian electoral system]] largely because drawing of electoral boundaries has typically been done by non-partisan [[Australian Electoral Commission|electoral commissions]]. There have been historical cases of [[malapportionment]], whereby the distribution of electors to electorates was not in proportion to the population [[Electoral system of Australia#Gerrymandering and malapportionment|in several states]]. For example, [[Thomas Playford IV|Sir Thomas Playford]] was [[Premiers of the Australian states|Premier]] of [[South Australia]] from 1938 to 1965 as a result of a system of malapportionment, which became known as the [[Playmander]], despite it not strictly speaking involving a gerrymander.<ref>{{cite book|last = Tilby Stock|first = Jenny|year = 1996|chapter = The 'Playmander': its origins, operations and effect on South Australia|editor1-last = O'Neil|editor1-first = Bernard|editor2-last = Raftery|editor2-first = Judith|editor3-last = Round|editor3-first = Kerrie|title = Playford's South Australia: Essays on the History of South Australia, 1933\u20131968|publisher = Association of Professional Historians|pages = 73\u201390|isbn = 978-0646290928}}</ref> More recently{{when|date=December 2018}} the nominally independent South Australian Electoral Districts Boundaries Commission has been accused of favouring the [[Australian Labor Party]], as the party has been able to form government in four of the last seven elections, despite receiving a lower two-party preferred vote.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nocookies |url=https://www.theaustralian.com/national-affairs/state-politics/liberals-blocked-by-unfair-boundaries-says-downer/story-e6frgczx-1226856356689 |work=The Australian}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Queensland]], malapportionment combined with a gerrymander under Premier Sir [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] became nicknamed the [[Bjelkemander]] in the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Orr|first1=Graham D.|last2=Levy|first2=Ron|title=Electoral Malapportionment: Partisanship, Rhetoric and Reform in the Shadow of the Agrarian Strong-Man|journal=[[Griffith Law Review]]|year=2009|volume=18|issue=3|pages=638\u2013665|ssrn=1579826|doi=10.1080/10854659.2009.10854659}}</ref> Under the system, electoral boundaries were drawn so that rural electorates had as few as half as many voters as metropolitan ones and regions with high levels of support for the opposition [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] were concentrated into fewer electorates, allowing Bjelke-Petersen's [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] (later National Party) led Coalition government to remain in power despite attracting substantially less than 50% of the vote.

In 1964, the federal government delegated the drawing of boundaries for federal electoral districts to the non-partisan agency [[Elections Canada]] which answers to Parliament rather than the government of the day.\n\nAs a result, gerrymandering is not generally a major issue in Canada except at the civic level.<ref>Jim Silver, ''The Failure of Civic Reform Movements in Winnipeg Civic Elections: 1971-1992'' (Winnipeg: Institute of Urban Studies, University of Winnipeg, 1995); available at https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0537/c2f86590a76ec1d0030175806c6dee13178d.pdf</ref> Although city wards are recommended by independent agencies, city councils occasionally overrule them. That is much more likely if the city is not homogenous and different neighbourhoods have sharply different opinions about city policy direction.\n\nIn 2006, a controversy arose in [[Prince Edward Island]] over the provincial government's decision to throw out an electoral map drawn by an independent commission. Instead, they created two new maps. The government adopted the second of them, which was designed by the [[caucus]] of the governing party. Opposition parties and the media attacked Premier [[Pat Binns]] for what they saw as gerrymandering of districts. Among other things, the government adopted a map that ensured that every current [[Member of the Legislative Assembly]] from the premier's party had a district to run in for re-election, but in the original map, several had been redistricted.<ref>{{cite news |title=No Christmas election: Binns |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/prince-edward-island/no-christmas-election-binns-1.608298 |work=[[cbc.ca]] |date=16 November 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, in the [[2007 Prince Edward Island general election|2007 provincial election]] only seven of 20 incumbent Members of the Legislative Assembly were re-elected (seven did not run for re-election), and the government was defeated.\n\n===Chile===\n\nThe military government which ruled [[Chile]] from 1973 to 1990 was ousted in a [[1988 Chilean national plebiscite|national plebiscite]] in October 1988. Opponents of General [[Augusto Pinochet]] voted NO to remove him from power and to trigger democratic elections, while supporters (mostly from the right-wing) voted YES to keep him in office for another eight years.\n\nFive months prior to the plebiscite, the regime published a law regulating future elections and referendums, but the configuration of electoral districts and the manner in which Congress seats would be awarded were only added to the law seven months after the referendum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30082&tipoVersion=0 |title=LEY-18700 06-MAY-1988 MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR |publisher=Leychile.cl |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idLey=18799 |title=LEY-18799 26-MAY-1989 MINISTERIO DEL INTERIOR |publisher=Leychile.cl |date= |accessdate=19 December 2010}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] (lower house), [[Electoral division of Chile|60 districts]] were drawn by grouping (mostly) neighboring [[Communes of Chile|communes]] (the smallest administrative subdivision in the country) within the same [[Regions of Chile|region]] (the largest). It was established that two deputies would be elected per district, with the most voted coalition needing to outpoll its closest rival by a margin of more than 2-to-1 to take both seats. The results of the 1988 plebiscite show that neither the \"NO\" side nor the \"YES\" side outpolled the other by said margin in any of the newly established districts. They also showed that the vote/seat ratio was lower in districts which supported the \"YES\" side and higher in those where the \"NO\" was strongest.<ref>[http://flacsochile.org/biblioteca/pub/memoria/1989/000261.pdf Documento de trabajo.

The 1980 Constitution allocated a number of seats to appointed senators, making it harder for one side to change the Constitution by itself. The opposition won 22 senate seats in the 1989 election, taking both seats in three out of 19 constituencies, controlling 58% of the elected Senate, but only 47% of the full Senate. The unelected senators were eliminated in the 2005 constitutional reforms, but the electoral map has remained largely untouched (two new regions were created in 2007, one of which altered the composition of two senatorial constituencies; the first election to be affected by this minor change took place in 2013).\n\n===France===\nFrance is one of the few countries to let legislatures redraw the map with no check.<ref>Balinski & Ba\u00efou (2002), ''D\u00e9coupage \u00e9lectoral'', Pour la science</ref> In practice, the legislature sets up an executive commission. Districts called ''arrondissements'' were used in the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] and under the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] they are called ''circonscriptions''. During the Third Republic, some reforms of arrondissements, which were also used for administrative purposes, were largely suspected to have been arranged to favour the kingmaker in the Assembly, the [[Parti radical]].\n\nThe dissolution of [[Seine (department)|Seine]] and [[Seine-et-Oise]] d\u00e9partements was seen as a case of Gerrymandering to counter communist influence around Paris.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://21maps.com/quand-la-politique-decoupe-la-geographie|title=Quand la politique d\u00e9coupe la g\u00e9ographie \u2022 21Maps|author=|date=15 March 2018|website=21maps.com}}</ref>\n\nIn the modern regime, there were three designs: in 1958 (regime change), 1987 (by [[Charles Pasqua]]) and 2010 (by [[Alain Marleix]]), three times by conservative governments. Pasqua's drawing was known to have been particularly good at gerrymandering, resulting in 80% of the seats with 58% of the vote in [[1993 French legislative election|1993]], and forcing Socialists [[1997 French legislative election|in the 1997 snap election]] to enact multiple pacts with smaller parties in order to win again, this time as a coalition. In 2010, the Sarkozy government created 12 districts for expats.\n\nThe [[Conseil Constitutionnel|Constitutional council]] was called twice by the opposition to decide about gerrymandering, but it never considered partisan disproportions. However, it forced the Marleix committee to respect an 80\u2013120% population ratio, ending a tradition dating back to the Revolution in which ''d\u00e9partements'', however small in population, would send at least two MPs.\n\nGerrymandering in France is also done against regionalist parties. ''D\u00e9partements'' are always used even if they split urban areas or larger identity territories, and smaller identity divisions are avoided.\n\n===Germany===\nWhen the electoral districts in Germany were redrawn in 2000, the ruling center-left Social Democratic Party ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) was accused of gerrymandering to marginalise the left-wing [[Left Party (Germany)|PDS]] party. The SPD combined traditional PDS strongholds in eastern Berlin with new districts made up of more populous areas of western Berlin, where the PDS had very limited following.\n\nAfter having won four seats in Berlin in the 1998 national election, the PDS was able to retain only two seats altogether in the 2002 elections. Under German electoral law, a political party has to win either more than five percent of the votes or at least three directly elected seats, to qualify for top-up seats under the [[Additional Member System]]. The PDS vote fell below five percent thus they failed to qualify for top-up seats and were confined to just two members of the [[Bundestag]], the German federal parliament (elected representatives are always allowed to hold their seats as individuals). Had they won a third constituency, the PDS would have gained at least 25 additional seats, which would have been enough to hold the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] in the Bundestag.\n\nIn the election of 2005, [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] (successor of the PDS) gained 8.7% of the votes and thus qualified for top-up seats.\n\n<!--Ugly paragraph and very confusing\u2014needs more explanation-->The number of Bundestag seats of parties which traditionally get over 5% of the votes cannot be affected very much by gerrymandering, because seats are awarded to these parties on a proportional basis. However, when a party wins so many districts in any one of the 16 federal states that those seats alone count for more than its proportional share of the vote in that same state does the districting have some influence on larger parties\u2014those extra seats, called \"[[Overhang seat|\u00dcberhangmandate]]\", remain. In the Bundestag election of 2009, Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU gained 24 such extra seats, while no other party gained any; this skewed the result so much that the [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany]] issued two rulings declaring the existing election laws invalid and requiring the Bundestag to pass a new law limiting such extra seats to no more than 15. In 2013, Germany's Supreme Court ruled on the constitutionality of \u00dcberhangmandate, which from then on have to be added in proportion to the second vote of each party thereby making it impossible that one party can have more seats than earned by the proportionate votes in the election.\n\n===Greece===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}\nGerrymandering has been rather common in [[Greece|Greek]] history since organised parties with national ballots only appeared after the 1926 Constitution.{{clarify|reason=Why was it common if there were no parties? Also, why was there then only one case BEFORE it?|date=October 2013}} The only case before that was the creation of the Piraeus electoral district in 1906, in order to give the Theotokis party a safe district.\n\nThe most infamous case of gerrymandering{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} was in the [[1956 Greek legislative election|1956 election]]. While in previous elections the districts were based on the [[prefecture]] level (\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2),{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} for 1956 the country was split in districts of varying sizes, some being the size of prefectures, some the size of sub-prefectures (\u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03b1) and others somewhere in between. In small districts the winning party would take all seats, in intermediate size, it would take most and there was proportional representation in the largest districts. The districts were created in such a way that small districts were those that traditionally voted for the right while large districts were those that voted against the right.\n\nThis system has become known as the three-phase (\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c6\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc) system or the [[baklava]] system (because, as baklava is split into full pieces and corner pieces, the country was also split into disproportionate pieces). The opposition, being composed of the center and the left, formed a coalition with the sole intent of changing the electoral law and then calling new elections. Even though the centrist and leftist opposition won the popular vote (1,620,007 votes against 1,594,992), the right-wing [[National Radical Union|ERE]] won the majority of seats (165 to 135) and was to lead the country for the next two years.\n\n===Hong Kong===\nIn [[Hong Kong]], functional constituencies are demarcated by the government and defined in statutes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hklii.org|title=''Legislative Council Ordinance''|work=hklii.org}}</ref> making them prone to gerrymandering.

Successive arrangements by governments of all political characters have been attacked as gerrymandering. Ireland uses the [[single transferable vote]], and as well as the actual boundaries drawn, the main tool of gerrymandering has been the number of seats per constituency used, with three-seat constituencies normally benefiting the strongest parties in an area, whereas four-seat constituencies normally help smaller parties.\n\nIn 1947 the rapid rise of new party [[Clann na Poblachta]] threatened the position of the governing party [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. The government of [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] introduced the [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1947]], which increased the size of the D\u00e1il from 138 to 147 and increased the number of three-seat constituencies from fifteen to twenty-two. The result was described by the journalist and historian [[Tim Pat Coogan]] as \"a blatant attempt at gerrymander which no [[Northern Ireland|Six County]] Unionist could have bettered.\"<ref name=\"coogan637\">Tim Pat Coogan, ''De Valera: Long Fellow, Long Shadow'' (Hutchinson, London, 1993) hardback. page 637 {{ISBN|0-09-175030-X}}</ref> The following February the [[1948 Irish general election|1948 general election]] was held and Clann na Poblachta secured ten seats instead of the nineteen they would have received proportional to their vote.<ref name=\"coogan637\" />\n\nIn the mid-1970s, the Minister for Local Government, [[James Tully (Irish politician)|James Tully]], attempted to arrange the constituencies to ensure that the governing [[Fine Gael]]\u2013[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] [[Government of the 20th D\u00e1il|National Coalition]] would win a parliamentary majority. The [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974]] was planned as a major reversal of previous gerrymandering by Fianna F\u00e1il (then in opposition). Tully ensured that there were as many as possible three-seat constituencies where the governing parties were strong, in the expectation that the governing parties would each win a seat in many constituencies, relegating Fianna F\u00e1il to one out of three.\n\nIn areas where the governing parties were weak, four-seat constituencies were used so that the governing parties had a strong chance of still winning two. The election results created substantial change, as there was a larger than expected collapse in the vote. Fianna F\u00e1il won a landslide victory in the [[1977 Irish general election]], two out of three seats in many cases, relegating the National Coalition parties to fight for the last seat. Consequently, the term \"[[Tullymandering]]\" was used to describe the phenomenon of a failed attempt at gerrymandering.\n\n===Kuwait===\nFrom the years 1981 until 2005, Kuwait was divided into 25 electoral districts in order to over-represent the government's supporters (the 'tribes').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asafas.kyoto-u.ac.jp/kias/pdf/kb4_1and2/08hiramatsu.pdf|title=The Changing Nature of the Parliamentary System in Kuwait|page=63 & 70|quote=Due to the gerrymandering on the part of the government, the \"tribes\" from the 1980s onwards, came to occupy a significant number of seats in the National Assembly.}}</ref> In July 2005, a new law for electoral reforms was approved which prevented electoral gerrymandering by cutting the number of electoral districts from 25 to 5. \nThe government of Kuwait found that 5 electoral districts resulted in a powerful parliament with the majority representing the opposition. A new law was crafted by the government of Kuwait and signed by the Amir to gerrymander the districts to 10 allowing the government's supporters to regain the majority.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ulrichsen |first1=Kristian Coates |title=Kuwait: Political crisis at critical juncture |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-20026581 |accessdate=1 April 2019 |publisher=BBC |date=}}</ref>\n\n===Malaysia===\n{{see also|List of Malaysian electoral districts}}\nThe practice of gerrymandering has been around in the country since its independence in 1957.

For example, during the [[2013 Malaysian general election|13th General Election in 2013]], Barisan Nasional won 60% of the seats in the Malaysian Parliament despite only receiving 47% of the popular vote.<ref>{{cite news|date=9 August 2014|title=What's Malay for gerrymandering?|url=https://www.economist.com/news/asia/21611139-years-delineation-electoral-boundaries-will-determine-future-malaysian-politics-whats|newspaper=The Economist|location=Kuala Lumpur|accessdate=9 November 2014}}</ref> Malapportionment has also been used at least since 1974, when it was observed that in one state alone (Perak), the parliamentary constituency with the most voters had more than ten times as many voters as the one with the fewest voters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ongkianming.com/2013/07/19/press-statement-malaysia-among-the-most-malapportioned-countries-in-the-world/ |title=Malaysia among the most malapportioned countries in the world |last=Yang Berhomat Dr. Ong |first=Kiang Ming MP|date=19 July 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2016 }}</ref> These practices finally failed BN in the [[2018 Malaysian general election|14th General Election]] on 9 May 2018, when the opposing ''[[Pakatan Harapan]]'' (PH; English: \"Alliance of Hope\") won despite perceived efforts of gerrymandering and malapportionment from the incumbent.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.nl/malaysia-election-results-details-who-won-2018-5/|title=In a historic election, Malaysia's allegedly corrupt prime minister lost to his 92-year-old former mentor who ran on behalf of a man he put in jail|date=10 May 2018|work=Business Insider|access-date=10 May 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Malta===\nThe Labour Party that won in 1981, even though the Nationalist Party got the most votes, did so because of its gerrymandering. A 1987 constitutional amendment prevented that situation from reoccurring.\n\n===Nepal===\nAfter the restoration of democracy in 1990, Nepali politics has well exercised the practice of gerrymandering with the view to take advantage in the election. It was often practised by [[Nepali Congress]], which remained in power in most of the time. Learning from this, the reshaping of constituency was done for constituent assembly and the opposition now wins elections.\n\n===Philippines===\n[[Legislative districts of the Philippines|Congressional districts in the Philippines]] were originally based on an ordinance from the 1987 [[Constitution of the Philippines|Constitution]], which was created by the Constitutional Commission, which was ultimately based on legislative districts as they were drawn in 1907. The same constitution gave [[Congress of the Philippines]] the power to legislate new districts, either through a national redistricting bill or piecemeal redistricting per province or city. Congress has never passed a national redistricting bill since the approval of the 1987 constitution, while it has incrementally created 34 new districts, out of the 200 originally created in 1987.\n\nThis allows Congress to create new districts once a place reaches 250,000 inhabitants, the minimum required for its creation. With this, local dynasties, through congressmen, can exert influence in the district-making process by creating bills carving new districts from old ones. In time, as the population of the Philippines increases, these districts, or groups of it, will be the basis of carving new provinces out of existing ones.\n\nAn example was in [[Camarines Sur]], where two districts were divided into three districts which allegedly favors the Andaya and the Arroyo families; it caused Rolando Andaya and [[Dato Arroyo]], who would have otherwise run against each other, run in separate districts, with one district allegedly not even surpassing the 250,000-population minimum.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/nation/558593/noynoy-hits-creation-camarines-sur-district-dato |title= Noynoy hits creation of Camarines Sur district for Dato |date=18 March 2010 |first=Aurea |last=Calica |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> The [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] later ruled that the 250,000 population minimum does not apply to an additional district in a province.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/564542/supreme-court-ruling-camsur-clears-senate |title=  Supreme Court ruling on Camsur clears Senate |date=9 April 2010 |first=Christina |last=Mendez |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref> The resulting splits would later be the cause of another gerrymander, where the province would be split into a new province called [[Nueva Camarines]]; the bill was defeated in the Senate in 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/06/08/13/senate-fails-pass-nueva-camarines-measure |title=Senate fails to pass Nueva Camarines measure |date=8 June 2013 |first=Christina |last=Mendez |work=[[The Philippine Star]] |publisher=ABS-CBNnews.com |accessdate=30 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Singapore===\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Singapore]] -->\nIn recent decades, critics have accused the ruling [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) of unfair electoral practices to maintain significant majorities in the [[Parliament of Singapore]].

The County Council has twenty-two Protestants and eight Catholics. In [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], Catholics are a majority of the population, 82,000 against 68,000; but the electoral districts have been so arranged that Unionists return sixteen as against thirteen Nationalists (one a Protestant). This Council gives to the Unionists two to one majority on its Committees, and out of fifty-two officials employs only five Catholics. In [[County Antrim|Antrim]], which has the largest Protestant majority (196,000 to 40,000), twenty-six Unionists and three Catholics are returned.

This meant that both the Unionist and Nationalist parties were over-represented, while the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] and [[Independent politician|Independents]] (amounting to more than 35% of the votes cast) were severely under-represented.\n\nFrom the outset, Northern Ireland had installed the [[single transferable vote]] (STV) system in order to secure fair elections in terms of proportional representation in its [[Parliament of Northern Ireland|Parliament]]. After two elections under that system, [[House of Commons (Method of Voting and Redistribution of Seats) Act (Northern Ireland) 1929|in 1929]] Stormont changed the electoral system to be the same as the rest of the [[United Kingdom]]: a single-member [[first past the post]] system. The only exception was for the election of four Stormont MPs to represent the [[Queen's University Belfast|Queen's University of Belfast]].

Most observers have acknowledged that the change to a single-winner system was a key factor, however, in stifling the growth of smaller political parties, such as the [[Northern Ireland Labour Party]] and [[Independent Unionist]]s.\n\nAfter Westminster reintroduced direct rule in 1973, it restored the single transferable vote (STV) for elections to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] in the following year, using the same definitions of constituencies as for the Westminster Parliament. Currently, in Northern Ireland, all elections use STV except those for positions in the [[Westminster Parliament]], which follow the pattern in the rest of the United Kingdom by using \"first past the post.\" m\n\n====Boundary Review====\nThe number of electors in a [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|United Kingdom constituency]] can vary considerably, with the smallest constituency currently (2017 electoral register) having fewer than a fifth of the electors of the largest (Scotland's Na h-Eileanan an Iar (21,769 constituents) and Orkney and Shetland (34,552), compared to England's North West Cambridgeshire (93,223) and Isle of Wight (110,697)). This variation has resulted from:\n\n*[[Scotland]] and [[Wales]] being favoured in the Westminster Parliament with deliberately smaller electoral quotas (average electors per constituency) than those in [[England]] and [[Northern Ireland]]. This inequality was initiated by the House of Commons (Redistribution of Seats) Act 1958, which eliminated the previous common electoral quota for the whole United Kingdom and replaced it with four separate national quotas for the respective Boundaries commissions to work to: England 69,534; Northern Ireland 67,145, Wales 58,383 and in Scotland only 54,741 electors.\n* Current rules historically favouring geographically \"natural\"{{clarify|date=April 2014}} districts, this continues to give proportionally greater representation to Wales and Scotland.\n* Population migrations, due to [[white flight]] and [[deindustrialization]] tending to decrease the number of electors in inner-city districts.\n\nUnder the [[Sixth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]], the [[Conservative \u2013 Liberal Democrat coalition agreement|Coalition government]] planned to review and redraw the parliamentary constituency boundaries for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]]. The review and redistricting was to be carried out by the [[boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|four UK boundary commissions]] to produce a reduction from 650 to 600 seats, and more uniform sizes, such that a [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituency]] was to have no fewer than 70,583 and no more than 80,473 electors.

It is often stated that incidents precede the 1789 election of the [[1st United States Congress|First U.S. Congress]]: namely, when [[Patrick Henry]] and his [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalist]] allies were in control of the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] in 1788, they drew the boundaries of [[Virginia's 5th congressional district]] in an unsuccessful attempt to keep [[James Madison]] out of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] via the candidacy of [[James Monroe]].<ref>Labunski, Richard.

The Republican Party used its control of Congress to secure the admission of more states in territories friendly to their party\u2014the admission of [[Dakota Territory]] as two states instead of one being a notable example. By the rules for representation in the [[United States Electoral College|Electoral College]], each new state carried at least three electoral votes regardless of its population.<ref>Compare a map of the United States in 1860 [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/us_terr_1860.jpg] with a map from 1870 [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/maps/united_states/us_terr_1870.jpg]. <!-- These images need to be put in wikimedia commons, rather than external links--></ref>\n\nAll redistricting in the United States has been contentious because it has been controlled by political parties vying for power. As a consequence of the decennial [[census]] required by the [[United States Constitution]], districts for members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] typically need to be redrawn whenever the number of members in a state changes. In many states, state legislatures redraw boundaries for state legislative districts at the same time.\n\nState legislatures have used gerrymandering along racial lines both to decrease and increase minority representation in state governments and congressional delegations. In Ohio, a conversation between Republican officials was recorded that demonstrated that redistricting was being done to aid their political candidates. Furthermore, the discussions assessed the race of voters as a factor in redistricting, on the premise that African-Americans tend to back Democratic candidates. Republicans apparently removed approximately 13,000 African-American voters from the district of [[Jim Raussen]], a Republican candidate for the House of Representatives, in an attempt to tip the scales in what was once a competitive district for Democratic candidates.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wcpo.com/wcpo/localshows/iteam/cdd905.html |title=Republican Party Politics (Part II) |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[WCPO]] |date=29 April 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515112805/http://www.wcpo.com/wcpo/localshows/iteam/cdd905.html |archivedate=15 May 2013 }}</ref>\n\nWith the Civil Rights Movement and passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], federal enforcement and protections of suffrage for all citizens were enacted. Gerrymandering for the purpose of reducing the political influence of a racial or ethnic minority group was prohibited. After the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed, some states created \"majority-minority\" districts to enhance minority voting strength. This practice, also called \"affirmative gerrymandering\", was supposed to redress historic discrimination and ensure that ethnic minorities would gain some seats and representation in government. In some states, bipartisan gerrymandering is the norm. State legislators from both parties sometimes agree to draw congressional district boundaries in a way that ensures the re-election of most or all incumbent representatives from both parties.<ref>{{cite news|title=In Virginia, an incumbent protection plan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/in-virginia-an-incumbent-protection-plan/2013/09/27/0e08acfc-27c0-11e3-b75d-5b7f66349852_story.html|accessdate=21 April 2016|work=The Washington Post|date=29 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nRather than allowing more political influence, some states have shifted redistricting authority from politicians and given it to non-partisan [[redistricting commission]]s.

{"title_page": "ISO/TC 292", "text_new": "'''ISO/TC 292 Security and resilience''' is a technical committee of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] formed in 2015 to develop standards in the area of security and resilience.\n\n[[File:ISO TC 292 .png|thumb|ISO/TC 292 at the 3rd plenary meeting in Edinburgh]]\n\nIn June 2014 the Technical Management Board of ISO (TMB) took the decision to create a new ISO technical committee called ISO/TC 292 where three committees were merged into one.<ref>http://www.isotc292online.org/about/history/</ref> The official starting date for the work of TC 292 was 2015-01-01, when the three committees were disbanded and their work incorporated into ISO/TC 292. The committee was also assigned the responsibility for the area of supply chain security, including the ISO 28000 series previously developed by ISO/TC&nbsp;8.\n\nThe creation of ISO/TC&nbsp;292 clarifies ISO's structural organization on security matters, and prepares ISO to tackle future topics in this field by creating a de facto coordination body within the TC central structure. This structure is optimized to limit and prevent conflict or duplication of work. It will assist public administrations/authorities with a general interest and protective mission to optimize their participation in ISO's work in this sector. Non-Profit organizations with limited resources will also benefit from this simplified structure.\n\nThe following committees were merged into ISO/TC&nbsp;292.\n* [[ISO/TC 223]] Societal security (2001\u20132014)\n* ISO/TC 247 Fraud countermeasures and controls (2009\u20132014)\n* ISO/PC 284 Management system for quality of PSC operations (2013\u20132014)\n\n== Scope ==\nISO/TC&nbsp;292 works under the following scope:\n\n''Standardization in the field of security to enhance the safety and resilience of society.<ref>https://www.iso.org/committee/5259148.html</ref> <br>\n''Excluded:'' Sector specific security projects developed in other relevant ISO committees and projects developed in ISO/TC&nbsp;262 and ISO/PC&nbsp;278.''\n\n== Leadership and organization ==\n* ''Chair''

292}}\n[[Category:ISO standards]]\n[[Category:ISO technical committees]]\n", "text_old": "'''ISO/TC 292 Security and resilience''' is a technical committee of the [[International Organization for Standardization]] formed in 2015 to develop standards in the area of security and resilience.\n\n[[File:ISO TC 292 .png|thumb|ISO/TC 292 at the 3rd plenary meeting in Edinburgh]]\n\nIn June 2014 the Technical Management Board of ISO (TMB) took the decision to create a new ISO technical committee called ISO/TC 292 where three committees were merged into one.<ref>http://www.isotc292online.org/about/history/</ref> The official starting date for the work of TC 292 was 2015-01-01, when the three committees were disbanded and their work incorporated into ISO/TC 292. The committee was also assigned the responsibility for the area of supply chain security, including the ISO 28000 series previously developed by ISO/TC&nbsp;8.\n\nThe creation of ISO/TC&nbsp;292 clarifies ISO's structural organization on security matters, and prepares ISO to tackle future topics in this field by creating a de facto coordination body within the TC central structure. This structure is optimized to limit and prevent conflict or duplication of work. It will assist public administrations/authorities with a general interest and protective mission to optimize their participation in ISO's work in this sector. Non-Profit organizations with limited resources will also benefit from this simplified structure.\n\nThe following committees were merged into ISO/TC&nbsp;292.\n* [[ISO/TC 223]] Societal security (2001\u20132014)\n* ISO/TC 247 Fraud countermeasures and controls (2009\u20132014)\n* ISO/PC 284 Management system for quality of PSC operations (2013\u20132014)\n\n== Scope ==\nISO/TC&nbsp;292 works under the following scope:\n\n''Standardization in the field of security to enhance the safety and resilience of society.<ref>https://www.iso.org/committee/5259148.html</ref> <br>\n''Excluded:'' Sector specific security projects developed in other relevant ISO committees and projects developed in ISO/TC&nbsp;262 and ISO/PC&nbsp;278.''\n\n== Leadership and organization ==\n* ''Chair''

Campbell''' (born February 28, 1948) was the 37th [[mayor]] of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] and is currently a member of the [[Senate of Canada]]. On April 6, 2016, he left the Senate Liberal caucus to sit as an Independent.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nBefore he was mayor, Campbell worked for the RCMP as a police officer, and in 1969, he was transferred to the Vancouver detachment.<ref name = \"bio\">[http://www.larrycampbell.ca/biography.shtml Biography], larrycampbell.coa</ref> From 1973, he served as a member of the force's drug squad.<ref name = \"bio\"/>\n\nStarting in 1981, Campbell worked for the Vancouver District Coroner's office.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn 1996, Campbell was appointed BC Chief Coroner, a post in which he served until 2000.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n== Early career ==\nOriginally from Ontario and of [[Scotland|Scottish]] descent, after high school Campbell's grandfather found him a job digging ditches for [[coaxial cable]].<ref name=\"YouTube\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElhjjEl3cKQ |title=The War on Drugs Has Failed.

He joined the [[RCMP]] on a bet with a Hamilton municipal police officer.  He spent about three years in uniform, but did not like to issue traffic tickets.  He was transferred to the drug squad in Vancouver where he worked in street enforcement mainly regarding heroin, including undercover work.  He started a drug squad in [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley]].  Throughout his RCMP tenure, he never laid a single [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] charge.<ref name=\"YouTube\" />\n\nAfter serving in the RCMP for 12 years, the provincial chief coroner told him that the new [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] would negatively impact his drug enforcement efforts and convinced him to become Vancouver's coroner.  During the emerging [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] pandemic, he became a strong advocate for progressive [[harm reduction]] policies, quipping that [[Needle-exchange programme|needle exchanges]] causing [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]] \"is like flies causing garbage\".  He served for 20 years, retiring as chief coroner for the province.<ref name=\"YouTube\" />\n\n== Election ==\nCampbell was elected in 2002 under the banner of the left-wing [[Coalition of Progressive Electors]] (COPE) party. He was the city's first mayor to be elected from the party.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nHis electoral success has often been tied to his personality and diverse background. As the city's former chief [[coroner]], his life inspired a popular [[CBC Television]] drama called ''[[Da Vinci's Inquest]]''.<ref name = \"bio\"/> The show was later followed by a spinoff, ''[[Da Vinci's City Hall]]'', in which the Da Vinci character followed his real-life counterpart into politics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Da Vinci's City Hall - IMDB|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469239/|website=imdb.com|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=14 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nCampbell was also popular for his opposition to the provincial government, led by BC premier [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] (no relation). Mayor Campbell sought to check the premier's eagerness to host the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] by calling for a citywide [[referendum]] on the bid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The mayor felt that the people needed a say about the Olympics, and since Gordon Campbell refused a provincial-wide referendum, Vancouver was only allowed to hold a non-binding, citywide [[plebiscite]]. Although Mayor Campbell had originally portrayed himself as critical of the bid, he eventually joined the \"yes\" side and began actively campaigning for it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The \"yes\" side ultimately won the vote, but only after a long and often highly polarized debate. His decision to \"[[flip-flop (politics)|flip-flop]]\" on the issue received widespread criticism, and some claimed this reflected a \"go with the flow\" attitude.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n== Mayor ==\nCampbell has publicly identified himself as a moderate [[centrism|centrist]], although his actions suggest that he was a left leaning candidate. His political positions put him in conflict with some of the leftist members of his [[Coalition of Progressive Electors]] party who had expected Campbell to take the city's government in a more social democratic direction once elected.<ref>[https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=ff4c2caa-6e75-4be4-affb-66ed7f006bc8&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A4FV4-00K0-TWD4-02RJ-00000-00&pddocid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A4FV4-00K0-TWD4-02RJ-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8370&pdteaserkey=sr7&pditab=allpods&ecomp=n7yk&earg=sr7&prid=8d3fbb41-27e7-4f2e-94ad-e63b570b5b1d Bula, Frances. \"Campbell stakes out centre: Jim Green aims subtle threat, invitation at diverse group at dinner,\" ''Vancouver Sun'', March 31, 2005, pp. B1.]</ref>\n\nShortly after Campbell's election, infighting broke out within his COPE party between the moderate Mayor and his like-minded city councillors versus some of their further [[Left-wing politics|left]] colleagues.  On December 14, 2004, Campbell and councillors [[Jim Green (councilman)|Jim Green]], [[Raymond Louie]] and [[Tim Stevenson]] announced that they would form an independent [[caucus]] within COPE. The media quickly dubbed the bloc the \"COPE Light\" councillors (in contrast to the \"COPE Classic\" councillors).<ref>[https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=ef03f341-1b5e-43d8-b97e-85e66620d151&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A4F1H-2JR0-TWD4-02BY-00000-00&pddocid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A4F1H-2JR0-TWD4-02BY-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8370&pdteaserkey=sr7&pditab=allpods&ecomp=n7yk&earg=sr7&prid=6ed173f7-cce7-4329-968f-c887b209b9cb Bula, Frances. \"Mayor Campbell, councillors will form their own caucus,\" ''Vancouver Sun'', December 15, 2004, pp. A1.]</ref>\n\nCampbell's two main projects in office were the [[Woodward's building]] redevelopment designed by architect [[Gregory Henriquez]] and the  establishment of a [[safe injection site]] to help curb Vancouver's injection drug problem. He had championed the idea of a \"four pillars\" approach to ending drug abuse.

Campbell''' (born February 28, 1948) was the 37th [[mayor]] of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]] and is currently a member of the [[Senate of Canada]]. On April 6, 2016, he left the Senate Liberal caucus to sit as an Independent.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nBefore he was mayor, Campbell worked for the RCMP as a police officer, and in 1969, he was transferred to the Vancouver detachment.<ref name = \"bio\">[http://www.larrycampbell.ca/biography.shtml Biography], larrycampbell.coa</ref> From 1973, he served as a member of the force's drug squad.<ref name = \"bio\"/>\n\nStarting in 1981, Campbell worked for the Vancouver District Coroner's office.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn 1996, Campbell was appointed BC Chief Coroner, a post in which he served until 2000.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n== Early career ==\nOriginally from Ontario and of [[Scotland|Scottish]] descent, after high school Campbell's grandfather found him a job digging ditches for [[coaxial cable]].<ref name=\"YouTube\">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElhjjEl3cKQ |title=The War on Drugs Has Failed.

He joined the [[RCMP]] on a bet with a Hamilton municipal police officer.  He spent about three years in uniform, but did not like to issue traffic tickets.  He was transferred to the drug squad in Vancouver where he worked in street enforcement mainly regarding heroin, including undercover work.  He started a drug squad in [[Langley, British Columbia (district municipality)|Langley]].  Throughout his RCMP tenure, he never laid a single [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] charge.<ref name=\"YouTube\" />\n\nAfter serving in the RCMP for 12 years, the provincial chief coroner told him that the new [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] would negatively impact his drug enforcement efforts and convinced him to become Vancouver's coroner.  During the emerging [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]] pandemic, he became a strong advocate for progressive [[harm reduction]] policies, quipping that [[Needle-exchange programme|needle exchanges]] causing [[Substance dependence|drug addiction]] \"is like flies causing garbage\".  He served for 20 years, retiring as chief coroner for the province.<ref name=\"YouTube\" />\n\n== Election ==\nCampbell was elected in 2002 under the banner of the left-wing [[Coalition of Progressive Electors]] (COPE) party. He was the city's first mayor to be elected from the party.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nHis electoral success has often been tied to his personality and diverse background. As the city's former chief [[coroner]], his life inspired a popular [[CBC Television]] drama called ''[[Da Vinci's Inquest]]''.<ref name = \"bio\"/> The show was later followed by a spinoff, ''[[Da Vinci's City Hall]]'', in which the Da Vinci character followed his real-life counterpart into politics.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Da Vinci's City Hall - IMDB|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469239/|website=imdb.com|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=14 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nCampbell was also popular for his opposition to the provincial government, led by BC premier [[Gordon Campbell (Canadian politician)|Gordon Campbell]] (no relation). Mayor Campbell sought to check the premier's eagerness to host the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] by calling for a citywide [[referendum]] on the bid.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The mayor felt that the people needed a say about the Olympics, and since Gordon Campbell refused a provincial-wide referendum, Vancouver was only allowed to hold a non-binding, citywide [[plebiscite]]. Although Mayor Campbell had originally portrayed himself as critical of the bid, he eventually joined the \"yes\" side and began actively campaigning for it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} The \"yes\" side ultimately won the vote, but only after a long and often highly polarized debate. His decision to \"[[flip-flop (politics)|flip-flop]]\" on the issue received widespread criticism, and some claimed this reflected a \"go with the flow\" attitude.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n== Mayor ==\nCampbell has publicly identified himself as a moderate [[centrism|centrist]], although his actions suggest that he was a left leaning candidate. His political positions put him in conflict with some of the leftist members of his [[Coalition of Progressive Electors]] party who had expected Campbell to take the city's government in a more social democratic direction once elected.<ref>[https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=ff4c2caa-6e75-4be4-affb-66ed7f006bc8&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A4FV4-00K0-TWD4-02RJ-00000-00&pddocid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A4FV4-00K0-TWD4-02RJ-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8370&pdteaserkey=sr7&pditab=allpods&ecomp=n7yk&earg=sr7&prid=8d3fbb41-27e7-4f2e-94ad-e63b570b5b1d Bula, Frances. \"Campbell stakes out centre: Jim Green aims subtle threat, invitation at diverse group at dinner,\" ''Vancouver Sun'', March 31, 2005, pp. B1.]</ref>\n\nShortly after Campbell's election, infighting broke out within his COPE party between the moderate Mayor and his like-minded city councillors versus some of their further [[Left-wing politics|left]] colleagues.  On December 14, 2004, Campbell and councillors [[Jim Green (councilman)|Jim Green]], [[Raymond Louie]] and [[Tim Stevenson]] announced that they would form an independent [[caucus]] within COPE. The media quickly dubbed the bloc the \"COPE Light\" councillors (in contrast to the \"COPE Classic\" councillors).<ref>[https://advance.lexis.com/document/?pdmfid=1516831&crid=ef03f341-1b5e-43d8-b97e-85e66620d151&pddocfullpath=%2Fshared%2Fdocument%2Fnews%2Furn%3AcontentItem%3A4F1H-2JR0-TWD4-02BY-00000-00&pddocid=urn%3AcontentItem%3A4F1H-2JR0-TWD4-02BY-00000-00&pdcontentcomponentid=8370&pdteaserkey=sr7&pditab=allpods&ecomp=n7yk&earg=sr7&prid=6ed173f7-cce7-4329-968f-c887b209b9cb Bula, Frances. \"Mayor Campbell, councillors will form their own caucus,\" ''Vancouver Sun'', December 15, 2004, pp. A1.]</ref>\n\nCampbell's two main projects in office were the [[Woodward's building]] redevelopment designed by architect [[Gregory Henriquez]] and the  establishment of a [[safe injection site]] to help curb Vancouver's injection drug problem. He had championed the idea of a \"four pillars\" approach to ending drug abuse. With the 1999 signing of the [[Vancouver Agreement]], the Four Pillars was characterized as \"Prevention, Treatment, Law Enforcement and Harm Reduction.\" Campbell promoted the implementation of the safe injection site (opened in September 2003), and the Vancouver Police Department assigned 60 officers to the Downtown Eastside in April 2003.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn 2005, the Mayor announced that he would run for a second term as an [[independent (politician)|independent]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} On 30 June 2005, Campbell changed his mind, however, announcing that he would not run for re-election at all in the fall municipal elections that year.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n== Senate ==\nOn August 2, 2005, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Paul Martin]] announced Campbell's appointment by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Adrienne Clarkson]] as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] senator.

The rules also require that a financial institution obtain a residential or business street address from each customer.

Where an out-of-competition sample tests positive for a banned substance, any performances by the athlete after that date may also be annulled.

{"title_page": "Friend of a friend", "text_new": "{{Other uses|Friend of a Friend (disambiguation)}} \n{{Wiktionary|FOAF}}\nThis page shouldn\u2019t even exist. Give me a break....... Person C is a friend of a friend of person A when there is a person B that is a [[friend]] of both A and C. Thus the human relation \"friend of a friend\" is a compound relation among friends, similar to the [[uncle]] and [[aunt]] relations of [[kinship]]. Though friendship is a [[symmetric relation|reciprocal relation]], the relation of a friend of a friend may not be a friendship, though it holds potential for coalition building and dissemination of information.\n\n==Balance theory==\n{{Main|Balance theory}}\nThe tendency of a friend of a friend to become a friend was noted by [[Fritz Heider]],<ref>[[Fritz Heider]] (1946) \"Attitudes and Cognitive Organization\", [[The Journal of Psychology]] 21: 107 to 21</ref> though he also considered the possibility that one of the friendships might breakdown, according to ''balance theory'', which his view of human triangles is called. According to Heider, the friend of a friend contact could be stressful enough to undermine one or another of the friendships. Extending the study of social dynamics caused by such friend-of-a-friend tensions to social networks beyond triangles, D.

Person C is a friend of a friend of person A when there is a person B that is a [[friend]] of both A and C. Thus the human relation \"friend of a friend\" is a compound relation among friends, similar to the [[uncle]] and [[aunt]] relations of [[kinship]]. Though friendship is a [[symmetric relation|reciprocal relation]], the relation of a friend of a friend may not be a friendship, though it holds potential for coalition building and dissemination of information.\n\n==Balance theory==\n{{Main|Balance theory}}\nThe tendency of a friend of a friend to become a friend was noted by [[Fritz Heider]],<ref>[[Fritz Heider]] (1946) \"Attitudes and Cognitive Organization\", [[The Journal of Psychology]] 21: 107 to 21</ref> though he also considered the possibility that one of the friendships might breakdown, according to ''balance theory'', which his view of human triangles is called. According to Heider, the friend of a friend contact could be stressful enough to undermine one or another of the friendships. Extending the study of social dynamics caused by such friend-of-a-friend tensions to social networks beyond triangles, D. Cartwright and [[Frank Harary]] used [[signed graph]]s to indicate positive or negative sentiments between persons.<ref>Cartwright, D. and [[Frank Harary]] (1956)[http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/cartwright56balance.pdf Structural balance: a generalization of Heider's theory],  [[Psychological Review]] 63: 277\u2013293 link from [[Stanford University]]</ref> In 1963 [[Anatol Rapoport]] summarized the theory: \"The hypothesis implies roughly that attitudes of the group members will change is such a way that one's friends' friends will tend to become one's friends, ...\"<ref>[[Anatol Rapoport]] (1963) \"Mathematical models of social interaction\", in [https://archive.org/details/handbookofmathem017893mbp ''Handbook of Mathematical Psychology'', v. 2], pp 493 to 580, especially 541, editors: R.A.
