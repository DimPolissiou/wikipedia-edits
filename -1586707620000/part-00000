Building on these experiences, Polyhedra was originally developed \"to bring the benefits of relational technology to the embedded market\". To this end, it had to be small footprint, very fast... and it had to avoid the need for [[Polling (computer science)|polling]], which is a performance killer. Consequently, it was designed from the start to:\n* keep the working copy of the data in-memory (though there is now a variant that keeps the data in a [[Flash memory|flash]]-based file);\n* use a client\u2013server architecture to protect the data from corruption by rogue application code;\n* have an 'active query' mechanism to update client applications when relevant database changes occur;\n* have a very simple processing model where a [[Database transaction|transaction]] is either a schema change, a query, or a request for a set of inserts, updates and/or deletes - such alterations can either be expressed via SQL statements or by updating through the active queries with (in conjunction with active queries) an [[Optimistic concurrency control|optimistic concurrency mechanism]] to handle clashing updates;\n* have a table [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] mechanism which, when combined with [[Database trigger]]s (via the CL language, see below), allows the database designer to program the database in an object-oriented fashion. Table inheritance also avoids or reduces the need for supplementary tables whose primary key is a foreign key to another table, and thus can simplify many queries and updates.\n* have a [[Operational historian|Historian]]<ref>{{Citation | url = http://developer.polyhedra.com/polyhedra-features/historian | series = White Paper | publisher = Enea |  title = Handling time-series data in Polyhedra IMDB }}.</ref> module to allow large volumes of times-series data to be captured, stored, archived and queried in an efficient fashion.\n\nPolyhedra IMDB achieves data persistence through the use of [[Snapshot (computer storage)#In databases|snapshots]] and [[Transaction log|journal logging]]; Polyhedra Flash DBMS uses [[shadow paging]], with 2 levels of recursion. In addition, Polyhedra can be used in [[Hot spare|hot-standby]] configurations for improved [[availability]]. The transactional model used by all Polyhedra products ensures atomicity, consistency and isolation (as defined by the [[ACID]] properties); durability is enforced in Polyhedra Flash DBMS, while in Polyhedra IMDB clients can choose the durability model when they issue their transactions.\n\n\"The Polyhedra DBMS system is fundamentally different compared to other relational systems, because of its active behaviour. This is achieved through two mechanisms, active queries and by the control language (CL). An active query looks quite like a normal query where some data is retrieved and/or written, but instead the query stays in the database until explicitly aborted. When a change in the data occurs that would alter the result of the query, the application is notified. The CL, which is a fully object-oriented script language that supports encapsulation, information hiding and inheritance, can determine the behaviour of data in the database. This means that methods, private or public, can be associated with data performing operations on them without involving the application.\"<ref>Aleksandra Te\u0161anovi\u0107, Dag Nystr\u00f6m, J\u00f6rgen Hansson, Christer Norstr\u00f6m:  [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.23.6688 Embedded databases for embedded real-time systems: a component-based approach] (2002)</ref>\n\nPolyhedra is not a general-purpose DBMS, as the restricted transactional model does not meet all needs, and its fault-tolerance model is based on the hot-standby approach (to minimise hardware costs) rather than [[Computer cluster|clustering]] (which is better for load-sharing). However, its limitations are benefits in embedded use, where the emphasis in a deployed application is on performance and cost rather than handling continually varying usage patterns.\n\nMost of the Polyhedra products are made available for purchase under a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] license, but in 2012 Enea released Polyhedra Lite under a freeware license.<ref name=\"poly_lite\"/>\n\n==Release history==\n* 1991 Development started.\n* 1993 '''Polyhedra 1.0''': first commercial release of an in-memory [[DBMS#Relational DBMS|Relational DBMS]] (RDBMS).\n* 1995 Ported to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]].\n* 1996 '''Polyhedra 2.0''': added [[hot spare|hot standby]] configurations for use in applications needing [[high availability]].

To this end, it had to be small footprint, very fast... and it had to avoid the need for [[Polling (computer science)|polling]], which is a performance killer. Consequently, it was designed from the start to:\n* keep the working copy of the data in-memory (though there is now a variant that keeps the data in a [[Flash memory|flash]]-based file);\n* use a client\u2013server architecture to protect the data from corruption by rogue application code;\n* have an 'active query' mechanism to update client applications when relevant database changes occur;\n* have a very simple processing model where a [[Database transaction|transaction]] is either a schema change, a query, or a request for a set of inserts, updates and/or deletes - such alterations can either be expressed via SQL statements or by updating through the active queries with (in conjunction with active queries) an [[Optimistic concurrency control|optimistic concurrency mechanism]] to handle clashing updates;\n* have a table [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]] mechanism which, when combined with [[Database trigger]]s (via the CL language, see below), allows the database designer to program the database in an object-oriented fashion. Table inheritance also avoids or reduces the need for supplementary tables whose primary key is a foreign key to another table, and thus can simplify many queries and updates.\n* have a [[Operational historian|Historian]]<ref>{{Citation | url = http://developer.polyhedra.com/polyhedra-features/historian | series = White Paper | publisher = Enea |  title = Handling time-series data in Polyhedra IMDB }}.</ref> module to allow large volumes of times-series data to be captured, stored, archived and queried in an efficient fashion.\n\nPolyhedra IMDB achieves data persistence through the use of [[Snapshot (computer storage)#In databases|snapshots]] and [[Transaction log|journal logging]]; Polyhedra Flash DBMS uses [[shadow paging]], with 2 levels of recursion. In addition, Polyhedra can be used in [[Hot spare|hot-standby]] configurations for improved [[availability]]. The transactional model used by all Polyhedra products ensures atomicity, consistency and isolation (as defined by the [[ACID]] properties); durability is enforced in Polyhedra Flash DBMS, while in Polyhedra IMDB clients can choose the durability model when they issue their transactions.\n\n\"The Polyhedra DBMS system is fundamentally different compared to other relational systems, because of its active behaviour. This is achieved through two mechanisms, active queries and by the control language (CL). An active query looks quite like a normal query where some data is retrieved and/or written, but instead the query stays in the database until explicitly aborted. When a change in the data occurs that would alter the result of the query, the application is notified. The CL, which is a fully object-oriented script language that supports encapsulation, information hiding and inheritance, can determine the behaviour of data in the database. This means that methods, private or public, can be associated with data performing operations on them without involving the application.\"<ref>Aleksandra Te\u0161anovi\u0107, Dag Nystr\u00f6m, J\u00f6rgen Hansson, Christer Norstr\u00f6m:  [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.23.6688 Embedded databases for embedded real-time systems: a component-based approach] (2002)</ref>\n\nPolyhedra is not a general-purpose DBMS, as the restricted transactional model does not meet all needs, and its fault-tolerance model is based on the hot-standby approach (to minimise hardware costs) rather than [[Computer cluster|clustering]] (which is better for load-sharing). However, its limitations are benefits in embedded use, where the emphasis in a deployed application is on performance and cost rather than handling continually varying usage patterns.\n\nMost of the Polyhedra products are made available for purchase under a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] license, but in 2012 Enea released Polyhedra Lite under a freeware license.<ref name=\"poly_lite\"/>\n\n==Release history==\n* 1991 Development started.\n* 1993 '''Polyhedra 1.0''': first commercial release of an in-memory [[DBMS#Relational DBMS|Relational DBMS]] (RDBMS).\n* 1995 Ported to [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Linux]].\n* 1996 '''Polyhedra 2.0''': added [[hot spare|hot standby]] configurations for use in applications needing [[high availability]].

{"title_page": "Warranty", "text_new": "{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=September 2010}}\nIn [[contract]] law, a '''warranty''' is a promise which is not a condition of the contract or an innominate term: (1) it is a term \"not going to the root of the contract\"<ref>Hogg M. (2011). ''Promises and Contract Law: Comparative Perspectives'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=cNaneRZu-_sC&pg=PA49 p. 48], Cambridge University Press.</ref>, and (2) which only entitles the innocent party to damages if it is breached<ref>Ibid</ref>: i.e. the warranty is not true or the defaulting party does not perform the contract in accordance with the terms of the warranty. A warranty is not a guarantee. It is a mere promise. It may be enforced if it is breached by an award for the [[legal remedy]] of damages.\n\nA warranty is a term of a contract. Depending on the terms of the contract, a product warranty may cover a product such that a manufacturer provides a warranty to a consumer with which the manufacturer has no direct contractual relationship.\n\nA warranty may be express or implied. An express warranty is expressly stated (typically, written); whether or not a term will be implied into a contract depends on the particular contract law of the country in question.  Warranties may also state that a particular fact is true at one point in time or that the fact will continue into the future (a \"continuing warranty\").\n\n== Sale of goods ==\nWarranties provided in the sale of goods (tangible [[product (business)|product]]s) vary according to jurisdiction, but commonly new goods are sold with implied warranty that the goods are as advertised. Used products, however, may be sold \"[[as is]]\" with no warranties. Each country, however, defines its own parameters with regard to implied conditions or implied warranties. This is because each country (a country as defined by international civil law) has its own system of contract law with its own set of rules. Said rules are largely standardised; i.e., the concepts of ''offer'', ''acceptance'', ''consideration'', ''capacity to contract'' and ''intention to create legal relations''. Those are the five elements to create a legally binding contract in the United States (all 50 states), England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, each of the seven states of Australia, and all other common law countries. Countries with civil law, however, recognise legally binding contracts which are not supported by consideration.\n\nIn the United States, various laws apply, including provisions in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] which provide for implied warranties.<ref>[http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/contracts/contracts14.htm Warranties in Sales of Goods]. LexisNexis Study Outlines.</ref> However, these implied warranties were often limited by [[disclaimer]]s. In 1975 the [[Magnuson\u2013Moss Warranty Act]] was passed to strengthen warranties on consumer goods.<ref name=12Magnuson/> Among other things, under the law implied warranties cannot be disclaimed if an express warranty is offered, and attorney fees may be recovered.<ref name=12Magnuson>[http://www.jtexconsumerlaw.com/V11N3/JCCL_Magnuson.pdf 12 Reasons to Love the Magnuson-Moss Act]. ''Journal of Texas Consumer Law''. Reprinted with permission from the [[National Consumer Law Center]].</ref> In some states, statutory warranties are required on new home construction, and \"[[lemon law]]s\" apply to motor vehicles.\n\n=== Express warranty ===\nExpress warranties are created when the seller makes a guarantee to the buyer that the product/service being offered has certain qualities. For there to exist an express warranty 1) a statement regarding the product/service must be made to the buyer and 2) the statement must play a role in the buyers decision to purchase the product/service. If, after purchase, the buyer feels that the given statement was a misrepresentation of the actual product/service, the buyer can file for breach of express warranty.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bagley|first=Constance|title=The Entrepreneur's Guide to Law and Strategy|last2=Dauchy|first2=Craig|publisher=Cengage Learning, Inc.|year=2018|isbn=978-1-285-42849-9|edition=Fifth Edition|location=Boston, MA|pages=313-315}}</ref>\n\n=== Implied warranty ===\n{{Main article|Implied warranty}}\n\nImplied warranties are unwritten promises that arise from the nature of the transaction, and the inherent understanding by the buyer, rather than from the express representations of the seller. In the United States, Article 2 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (which has been adopted with variations in each [[U.S. state|state]]) provides that the following two warranties are implied unless they are explicitly disclaimed (such as an \"[[as is]]\" statement):\n\n*The '''warranty of merchantability''' is implied unless expressly disclaimed by name, or the sale is identified with the phrase \"[[as is]]\" or \"with all faults.\"  To be \"merchantable\", the goods must reasonably conform to an ordinary buyer's expectations. For example, a fruit that looks and smells good but has hidden defects may violate the warranty if its quality does not meet the standards for such fruit \"as passes ordinarily in the trade\". In most states, products inherently come with implied warranty of mechantiblity; however, in states like [[Massachusetts]] under [[consumer protection law]], it is illegal to disclaim this warranty on household goods sold to consumers. ([[Massachusetts General Laws]], Chapter 106: Section 2-316A)\n*The '''warranty of fitness for a particular purpose''' is implied unless disclaimed when a buyer relies upon the seller to select the goods to fit a specific request. For example, this warranty is violated when a buyer asks a mechanic to provide tires for use on snowy roads and receives tires that are unsafe to use in snow.\n\n=== Defects In Materials and Workmanship. ===\nA common kind of warranty on goods is a warranty that the product is free from material defects in materials and workmanship.  This simply promises that the manufacturer properly constructed the product, out of proper materials.  This implies that the product is not defective for the purposes for which it was made. \n\nWarranties may be time limited, thus limiting the time the buyer has to make a claim for breach of warranty.  For example, a typical 90-day warranty on a television gives the buyer 90 days from the date of purchase to claim that the television was improperly constructed.  Should the television fail after 91 days of normal usage, which because televisions customarily last longer than 91 days means there was a defect in the materials or workmanship of the television, the buyer nonetheless may not collect on the warranty because it is too late to file a claim. Consumer protection law, implement by statute, however provide additional remedies as it is not usually expected that a television will last for only 90 days.\n\nTime-limited warranties are often confused with performance warranties.  A 90-day performance warranty would promise that the television would work for 90 days, which is fundamentally different from promising that it was delivered free of defects and limiting the time the buyer has to prove otherwise.  But because the usual evidence that a product was delivered defective is that it later breaks, the effect is very similar.\n\nOne situation in which the effect of a time-limited warranty is different from the effect of a performance warranty is where the time limit exceeds a normal lifetime of the product.  If a coat is designed to last two years, but has a 10-year limited warranty against defects in materials and workmanship, a buyer who wears the coat for 3 years and then finds it worn out would not be able to collect on the warranty.  But it is different from a 2-year warranty because if the buyer starts wearing the coat 5 years after buying it, and finds it wears out a year later, the buyer would have a warranty claim in Year 6.  On the other hand, a 10-year performance warranty would promise that the coat would last 10 years.\n\n=== Satisfaction guarantee ===\nIn the United States, the [[Magnuson\u2013Moss Warranty Act]] of 1976 provides for enforcement of a satisfaction guarantee warranty. In these cases, the advertiser must refund the full purchase price regardless of the reason for dissatisfaction.<ref>Andreoni J. (2005). [http://econ.ucsd.edu/~jandreon/WorkingPapers/verify.pdf Trust, Reciprocity, and Contract Enforcement: Experiments on Satisfaction Guaranteed].</ref>\n\n=== Lifetime warranty ===\nA lifetime warranty is usually a warranty against defects in materials and workmanship that has no time limit to make a claim, rather than a warranty that the product will perform for the lifetime of the buyer.<ref>[http://www.warrantyweek.com/archive/ww20090813.html Lifetime Warranties]. ''Warranty Week''. [https://www.webcitation.org/6H0uHIxKE WebCite Archive].</ref>  The actual time that product can be expected to perform is normally determined by the custom for products of its kind used the way the buyer uses it.\n\nIf a product has been discontinued and is no longer available, the warranty may last a limited period longer. For example:\n\n* the Cisco Limited Lifetime Warranty currently lasts for five years after the product has been discontinued, but only if you know where you bought it from as the seller is responsible for administering it.<ref>{{Cite web | title = Cisco Limited Lifetime Hardware Warranty Terms| url=http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/general/warranty/English/LH2DEN__.html| accessdate = 2008-09-10 }}</ref>\n* HP Networking product lifetime warranties last for as long as one owns the product.<ref>{{Cite web| title = HP Networking warranty information| url=http://h17007.www1.hp.com/us/en/support/warranty/index.aspx| accessdate = 2011-08-26 }}</ref>\n\n=== Breach of warranty ===\nWarranties are breached when the promise is not performed at all, or not performed in accordance with the contract. The seller may honor the warranty by making a refund or a replacement. The [[statute of limitations]] depends on the jurisdiction and contractual agreements. In the United States, the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] \u00a7 2-725 provides for a four-year time limit, which can be limited to one year by contract, starting from the date of delivery or if future performance is guaranteed from the date of discovery. Refusing to honor the warranty may be an [[unfair business practice]]. In the United States, breach of warranty lawsuits may be distinct from [[revocation]] of contract suits; in the case of the breach of warranty, the buyer's item is repaired or replaced while breach of contract involves returning the item to the seller.<ref>Davis T. (2009). [http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/116813.pdf UCC Breach of Warranty and Contract Claims: Clarifying the Distinction]. ''Baylor Law Review''.</ref>\n\nSome warranties require that repairs be undertaken by an [[authorized service provider]]. In such cases, service by non-authorized personnel or company may [[void (law)|void]] (nullify) the warranty.  However, according to the Magnuson-Moss Act (a U.S. Federal law that governs warranties, which was passed in 1975), if the warranty does not provide full or partial payment of labor (to repair the device or system), it is the owner's choice who will provide the labor, including the possibility of DIY (\"Do It Yourself\") repairs, in which case the device or system owner will pay zero dollars for labor, yet the company that provided the warranty must still provide all the parts needed for the repair at absolutely no charge to the owner.\n\nIf the defective product causes injury, this may be a [[cause of action]] for a [[product liability]] lawsuit ([[tort]]). [[Strict liability]] may be applied.\n\n== Extended warranty ==\nIn addition to standard warranties on new items, third parties or manufacturers may sell or offer extended warranties (also called service contracts).<ref>{{cite web|title=Appliances - 247 Home Rescue |url=https://www.247homerescue.co.uk/appliance-breakdown-cover/ |accessdate=26 June 2015 |publisher=247 Home Rescue}}</ref> These extend the warranty for a further length of time. However, these warranties have terms and conditions which may not match the original terms and conditions. For example, these may not cover anything other than mechanical failure from normal usage. Exclusions may include commercial use, \"acts of God\", owner abuse, and malicious destruction. They may also exclude parts that normally wear out such as tires and lubrication on a vehicle.\n\nThese types of warranties are provided for various products, but [[automobile]]s and [[Small appliance|electronics]] are common examples. Warranties which are sold through retailers such as [[Best Buy]] may include significant commission for the retailer as a result of [[reverse competition]].<ref>Baker T, Siegelman P. (2013). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2199569 Protecting Consumers from Add-On Insurance Products: New Lessons for Insurance Regulation].</ref> For instance, an auto warranty from a [[car dealership]] may be subcontracted and vehicle repairs may be at a lower rate which could compromise the quality of service. At the time of repair, out-of-pocket expenses may be charged for unexpected services provided outside of the warranty terms or uncovered parts.\n\n== Representations versus warranties ==\n{{Further information|Misrepresentation}}\n\nStatements of fact in a contract or in obtaining the contract are considered to be either warranties or representations. Traditionally, warranties are factual promises which are enforced through a contract legal action, regardless of materiality, intent, or reliance.<ref name=West&Lewis2009/> Representations are traditionally *pre*contractual statements which allow for a tort-based action if the misrepresentation is innocent, negligent or fraudulent.<ref name=Primack2009>Primack MA.

A warranty is not a guarantee. It is a mere promise. It may be enforced if it is breached by an award for the [[legal remedy]] of damages.\n\nA warranty is a term of a contract. Depending on the terms of the contract, a product warranty may cover a product such that a manufacturer provides a warranty to a consumer with which the manufacturer has no direct contractual relationship.\n\nA warranty may be express or implied. An express warranty is expressly stated (typically, written); whether or not a term will be implied into a contract depends on the particular contract law of the country in question.  Warranties may also state that a particular fact is true at one point in time or that the fact will continue into the future (a \"continuing warranty\").\n\n== Sale of goods ==\nWarranties provided in the sale of goods (tangible [[product (business)|product]]s) vary according to jurisdiction, but commonly new goods are sold with implied warranty that the goods are as advertised. Used products, however, may be sold \"[[as is]]\" with no warranties. Each country, however, defines its own parameters with regard to implied conditions or implied warranties. This is because each country (a country as defined by international civil law) has its own system of contract law with its own set of rules. Said rules are largely standardised; i.e., the concepts of ''offer'', ''acceptance'', ''consideration'', ''capacity to contract'' and ''intention to create legal relations''. Those are the five elements to create a legally binding contract in the United States (all 50 states), England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, each of the seven states of Australia, and all other common law countries. Countries with civil law, however, recognise legally binding contracts which are not supported by consideration.\n\nIn the United States, various laws apply, including provisions in the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] which provide for implied warranties.<ref>[http://www.lexisnexis.com/lawschool/study/outlines/html/contracts/contracts14.htm Warranties in Sales of Goods]. LexisNexis Study Outlines.</ref> However, these implied warranties were often limited by [[disclaimer]]s. In 1975 the [[Magnuson\u2013Moss Warranty Act]] was passed to strengthen warranties on consumer goods.<ref name=12Magnuson/> Among other things, under the law implied warranties cannot be disclaimed if an express warranty is offered, and attorney fees may be recovered.<ref name=12Magnuson>[http://www.jtexconsumerlaw.com/V11N3/JCCL_Magnuson.pdf 12 Reasons to Love the Magnuson-Moss Act].

In the United States, breach of warranty lawsuits may be distinct from [[revocation]] of contract suits; in the case of the breach of warranty, the buyer's item is repaired or replaced while breach of contract involves returning the item to the seller.<ref>Davis T. (2009). [http://www.baylor.edu/content/services/document.php/116813.pdf UCC Breach of Warranty and Contract Claims: Clarifying the Distinction]. ''Baylor Law Review''.</ref>\n\nSome warranties require that repairs be undertaken by an [[authorized service provider]]. In such cases, service by non-authorized personnel or company may [[void (law)|void]] (nullify) the warranty.  However, according to the Magnuson-Moss Act (a U.S. Federal law that governs warranties, which was passed in 1975), if the warranty does not provide full or partial payment of labor (to repair the device or system), it is the owner's choice who will provide the labor, including the possibility of DIY (\"Do It Yourself\") repairs, in which case the device or system owner will pay zero dollars for labor, yet the company that provided the warranty must still provide all the parts needed for the repair at absolutely no charge to the owner.\n\nIf the defective product causes injury, this may be a [[cause of action]] for a [[product liability]] lawsuit ([[tort]]). [[Strict liability]] may be applied.\n\n== Extended warranty ==\nIn addition to standard warranties on new items, third parties or manufacturers may sell or offer extended warranties (also called service contracts).<ref>{{cite web|title=Appliances - 247 Home Rescue |url=https://www.247homerescue.co.uk/appliance-breakdown-cover/ |accessdate=26 June 2015 |publisher=247 Home Rescue}}</ref> These extend the warranty for a further length of time. However, these warranties have terms and conditions which may not match the original terms and conditions. For example, these may not cover anything other than mechanical failure from normal usage. Exclusions may include commercial use, \"acts of God\", owner abuse, and malicious destruction. They may also exclude parts that normally wear out such as tires and lubrication on a vehicle.\n\nThese types of warranties are provided for various products, but [[automobile]]s and [[Small appliance|electronics]] are common examples. Warranties which are sold through retailers such as [[Best Buy]] may include significant commission for the retailer as a result of [[reverse competition]].<ref>Baker T, Siegelman P. (2013). [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2199569 Protecting Consumers from Add-On Insurance Products: New Lessons for Insurance Regulation].</ref> For instance, an auto warranty from a [[car dealership]] may be subcontracted and vehicle repairs may be at a lower rate which could compromise the quality of service. At the time of repair, out-of-pocket expenses may be charged for unexpected services provided outside of the warranty terms or uncovered parts.\n\n== Representations versus warranties ==\n{{Further information|Misrepresentation}}\n\nStatements of fact in a contract or in obtaining the contract are considered to be either warranties or representations. Traditionally, warranties are factual promises which are enforced through a contract legal action, regardless of materiality, intent, or reliance.<ref name=West&Lewis2009/> Representations are traditionally *pre*contractual statements which allow for a tort-based action if the misrepresentation is innocent, negligent or fraudulent.<ref name=Primack2009>Primack MA.

Not so Iblis: he refused He was of those who reject faith (those who are disobedient).\" (2:34)</blockquote>God later places Adam and  Eve in the garden and tells them that they are free to enjoy of its fruits except not to come near a certain tree: (2:35)<blockquote>\"We said: \"O Adam! dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat of the bountiful things therein as (where and when) ye will; but approach not this tree, or ye run into harm and transgression.\"</blockquote>Satan then deceives Adam and Eve into eating of the fruits of the tree: (2:36)<blockquote>\"Then did Satan make them slip from the (garden), and get them out of the state (of felicity) in which they had been.

The couple elope and get married against both families' wishes which leads both families to abandon them. Also enmity is created between the two families and they hate each other. Vasudevan (Malaysia Vasudevan) is the son of Sadhasivam and Moses (Jaiganesh) is the son of Stephen.\n\nAfter 25 years, both the families receive a letter from Raja (Vijay), who is born to Robert and Janaki and who is also visiting the families. Both the families get furious seeing the letter and they decide not to permit him to stay in their homes. Raja comes to the town along with his friend Gopi (Charle) but is shocked that he is not allowed inside both the houses. Also Vasudevan and Moses ask the entire street to not let any house for rent to Raja and Gopi. Velangiri (Meesai Murugesh) lives along with his wife and he permits Raja to stay in his house.\n\nThough Sadhasivam and Stephen do not welcome Raja, but still they long to see their grandson from far. Same is the case with their wives Vijayakumari and Sukumari. Raja understands that only Vasudevan and Moses who are still angry while the other family members just pretend to be angry. So he decides to unite the family. He gets close with his grandparents slowly. Vijayakumari and Sukumari wanted to get Raja married. To escape, Raja lies that he is already married to a girl named Nirmala Mary aka Nimmy.\n\nTo Raja's shock, suddenly one day, Nirmala (Sangita) arrives at Velangiri's home introducing herself as the wife of Raja. Raja gets confused and he cannot reveal the truth as that would further disturb the proceedings. Nirmala plays pranks on Raja and Gopi, which always irritates them. One day, Raja plans to make love with Nirmala, so that she will reveal her true identity. Nirmala reveals that she is the only child and daughter named Priyadarshini aka Priya born to Robert and Janaki. She also says that the only man who stays in touch with her family in the town is Velangiri from whom they get frequent updates about the happenings. Now Priyadarshini questions Raja's intention about trying to unite both the families.\n\nRaja reveals a flashback. Raja is an orphan who lives along with his friend Gopi in Chennai. Next to his house, there is a girls\u2019 hostel. Nandhini (Anju Aravind) is the daughter of Vasudevan and she stays in the hostel. Raja gets attracted seeing Nandhini and befriends her. Slowly friendship blossoms into love for Raja. When he is about to convey his love, Raja gets shocked to know that Nandhini is already in love with Lawrence (Sakthi Kumar), who is the son of Moses. As there is enmity between the two families, already the couple fears whether their love would be accepted by their family members.\n\nRaja on knowing about the problem, decides to help the couple unite with the approval of their family members. Raja takes the responsibility of convincing both the families and disguises himself as the son born to Robert and Janaki. Priya gets surprised knowing Raja's intention of getting the family united despite knowing the fact that Nandhini is in love with Lawrence. Priya gets attracted towards Raja and starts loving him but does not express it.\n\nMeanwhile, both the families get to know that Nandhini and Lawrence are in love and they get furious again. But Raja takes the couple somewhere and brings them back after a few hours. But Nandhini gets converted to [[Christianity]] while Lawrence gets converted to [[Hinduism]]. Raja makes the family members realize that love is eternal and it knows no religion/caste etc. Both the families get convinced listening to Raja's words and they agree for the wedding between Lawrence and Nandhini.\n\nOn the day of wedding, both Robert and Janaki arrive and the family members happily welcome them and they also apologize for keeping them away for 25 years. Both the families mention that it was their son Raja, who was responsible for reuniting the families. Robert and Janaki get surprised and reveal that they have only one child, which is a daughter named Priyadarshini. Priya reveals that Raja is the friend of Nandhini and he has come to unite the family so that they can get married.  Both the families feel proud seeing Raja and they suggest getting Priya married to Raja. But Raja denies saying that he already had an unsuccessful love story and he can never fall in love again with one more girl. The movie ends with Raja leaving the house and walking alone.{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Raja\n* [[Sangita Madhavan Nair|Sangita]] as Priyadarshini / Nirmala Mary \n* [[Anju Aravind]] as Nandhini\n* [[Charle]] as Gopi\n* [[M.

The couple elope and get married against both families' wishes which leads both families to abandon them. Also enmity is created between the two families and they hate each other. Vasudevan (Malaysia Vasudevan) is the son of Sadhasivam and Moses (Jaiganesh) is the son of Stephen.\n\nAfter 25 years, both the families receive a letter from Raja (Vijay), who is born to Robert and Janaki and who is also visiting the families. Both the families get furious seeing the letter and they decide not to permit him to stay in their homes. Raja comes to the town along with his friend Gopi (Charle) but is shocked that he is not allowed inside both the houses. Also Vasudevan and Moses ask the entire street to not let any house for rent to Raja and Gopi. Velangiri (Meesai Murugesh) lives along with his wife and he permits Raja to stay in his house.\n\nThough Sadhasivam and Stephen do not welcome Raja, but still they long to see their grandson from far. Same is the case with their wives Vijayakumari and Sukumari. Raja understands that only Vasudevan and Moses who are still angry while the other family members just pretend to be angry. So he decides to unite the family. He gets close with his grandparents slowly. Vijayakumari and Sukumari wanted to get Raja married. To escape, Raja lies that he is already married to a girl named Nirmala Mary aka Nimmy.\n\nTo Raja's shock, suddenly one day, Nirmala (Sangita) arrives at Velangiri's home introducing herself as the wife of Raja. Raja gets confused and he cannot reveal the truth as that would further disturb the proceedings. Nirmala plays pranks on Raja and Gopi, which always irritates them. One day, Raja plans to make love with Nirmala, so that she will reveal her true identity. Nirmala reveals that she is the only child and daughter named Priyadarshini aka Priya born to Robert and Janaki. She also says that the only man who stays in touch with her family in the town is Velangiri from whom they get frequent updates about the happenings. Now Priyadarshini questions Raja's intention about trying to unite both the families.\n\nRaja reveals a flashback. Raja is an orphan who lives along with his friend Gopi in Chennai. Next to his house, there is a girls\u2019 hostel. Nandhini (Anju Aravind) is the daughter of Vasudevan and she stays in the hostel. Raja gets attracted seeing Nandhini and befriends her. Slowly friendship blossoms into love for Raja. When he is about to convey his love, Raja gets shocked to know that Nandhini is already in love with Lawrence (Sakthi Kumar), who is the son of Moses. As there is enmity between the two families, already the couple fears whether their love would be accepted by their family members.\n\nRaja on knowing about the problem, decides to help the couple unite with the approval of their family members. Raja takes the responsibility of convincing both the families and disguises himself as the son born to Robert and Janaki. Priya gets surprised knowing Raja's intention of getting the family united despite knowing the fact that Nandhini is in love with Lawrence. Priya gets attracted towards Raja and starts loving him but does not express it.\n\nMeanwhile, both the families get to know that Nandhini and Lawrence are in love and they get furious again. But Raja takes the couple somewhere and brings them back after a few hours. But Nandhini gets converted to [[Christianity]] while Lawrence gets converted to [[Hinduism]]. Raja makes the family members realize that love is eternal and it knows no religion/caste etc. Both the families get convinced listening to Raja's words and they agree for the wedding between Lawrence and Nandhini.\n\nOn the day of wedding, both Robert and Janaki arrive and the family members happily welcome them and they also apologize for keeping them away for 25 years. Both the families mention that it was their son Raja, who was responsible for reuniting the families. Robert and Janaki get surprised and reveal that they have only one child, which is a daughter named Priyadarshini. Priya reveals that Raja is the friend of Nandhini and he has come to unite the family so that they can get married.  Both the families feel proud seeing Raja and they suggest getting Priya married to Raja. But Raja denies saying that he already had an unsuccessful love story and he can never fall in love again with one more girl. The movie ends with Raja leaving the house and walking alone.{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2010}}\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay (actor)|Vijay]] as Raja\n* [[Sangita Madhavan Nair|Sangita]] as Priyadarshini / Nirmala Mary \n* [[Anju Aravind]] as Nandhini\n* [[Charle]] as Gopi\n* [[M.
