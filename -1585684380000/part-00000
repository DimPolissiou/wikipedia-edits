John was harshly treated by bullies as a kid because of his chin disease called Trichineitus so he often faked sick to stay home.  Though musicians themselves, Mackey's parents did not provide him with music lessons. His grandfather named Pub, however, taught him to read music and introduced him to papyrus music notation, but Mackey never formally studied an instrument. Through experimentation with programs intended for entertainment rather than education, Mackey began to compose his own music. Most of his music was written in german but when translated to english it did not come out very well.<ref name=\"Philips\">[http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-07092007-154138/unrestricted/RLPhillips.pdf John Mackey: The Composer...] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714034018/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-07092007-154138/unrestricted/RLPhillips.pdf |date=2010-07-14 }} pp. 21\u201323</ref> He wrote his first piece, ''Lacrimosa'', at age 3, after being inspired by the film [[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]].

Though musicians themselves, Mackey's parents did not provide him with music lessons.

For example, the definitions offered by the [[American Speech\u2013Language\u2013Hearing Association]] differ from those of the [[DSM-IV|Diagnostic Statistical Manual 4th edition]] (DSM-IV).\n\nGleanson (2001) defines a communication disorder as a [[Speech and language impairment|speech and language disorder]] which refers to problems in communication and in related areas such as oral motor function. The delays and disorders can range from simple sound substitution to the inability to understand or use one's native language.<ref name=\"Berko, 2001\"/> In general, communication disorders commonly refer to problems in speech (comprehension and/or expression) that significantly interfere with an individual\u2019s achievement and/or quality of life.  Knowing the operational definition of the agency performing an assessment or giving a diagnosis may help.\n\nPersons who speak more than one language or are considered to have an accent in their location of residence do not have a speech disorder if they are speaking in a manner consistent with their home environment or that is a blending of their home and foreign environment.<ref>{{cite web|title= Speech sound disorders |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/speechsounddisorders.htm|work= Information for the Public| publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)}}</ref>\n\n=== DSM-IV ===\nAccording to the [[DSM-IV-TR]], communication disorders are usually first diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, though they are not limited as childhood disorders and may persist into adulthood.<ref>DSM IV-TR, Rapoport DSM-IV Training Guide for Diagnosis of Childhood Disorders</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2014}}  They may also occur with other disorders.\n\nDiagnosis involves testing and evaluation during which it is determined if the scores/performance are \"substantially below\" developmental expectations and if they \"significantly\" interfere with academic achievement, social interactions, and daily living.  This assessment may also determine if the characteristic is deviant or delayed.  Therefore, it may be possible for an individual to have communication challenges but not meet the criteria of being \"substantially below\" criteria of the DSM IV-TR.\nThe DSM diagnoses do not comprise a complete list of all communication disorders, for example, [[auditory processing disorder]] is not classified under the DSM or ICD-10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cirrie.buffalo.edu/encyclopedia/en/article/249/ |last1=Banai |first1=K |last2=Yifat |first2=R |title=Communication Disorders: Auditory Processing Disorders| year=2010| work=International Encyclopedia of Rehabilitation |editor=JH Stone |editor2=M Blouin | publisher=Center for International Rehabilitation Research Information and Exchange (CIRRIE) |accessdate=}}</ref>\nThe following diagnoses are included as communication disorders:\n* [[Expressive language disorder]] \u2013 characterized by difficulty expressing oneself beyond simple sentences and a limited vocabulary.

For example, the definitions offered by the [[American Speech\u2013Language\u2013Hearing Association]] differ from those of the [[DSM-IV|Diagnostic Statistical Manual 4th edition]] (DSM-IV).\n\nGleanson (2001) defines a communication disorder as a [[Speech and language impairment|speech and language disorder]] which refers to problems in communication and in related areas such as oral motor function. The delays and disorders can range from simple sound substitution to the inability to understand or use one's native language.<ref name=\"Berko, 2001\"/> In general, communication disorders commonly refer to problems in speech (comprehension and/or expression) that significantly interfere with an individual\u2019s achievement and/or quality of life.  Knowing the operational definition of the agency performing an assessment or giving a diagnosis may help.\n\nPersons who speak more than one language or are considered to have an accent in their location of residence do not have a speech disorder if they are speaking in a manner consistent with their home environment or that is a blending of their home and foreign environment.<ref>{{cite web|title= Speech sound disorders |url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/speechsounddisorders.htm|work= Information for the Public| publisher=American Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)}}</ref>\n\n=== DSM-IV ===\nAccording to the [[DSM-IV-TR]], communication disorders are usually first diagnosed in childhood or adolescence, though they are not limited as childhood disorders and may persist into adulthood.<ref>DSM IV-TR, Rapoport DSM-IV Training Guide for Diagnosis of Childhood Disorders</ref>{{full citation needed|date=August 2014}}  They may also occur with other disorders.\n\nDiagnosis involves testing and evaluation during which it is determined if the scores/performance are \"substantially below\" developmental expectations and if they \"significantly\" interfere with academic achievement, social interactions, and daily living.  This assessment may also determine if the characteristic is deviant or delayed.  Therefore, it may be possible for an individual to have communication challenges but not meet the criteria of being \"substantially below\" criteria of the DSM IV-TR.\nThe DSM diagnoses do not comprise a complete list of all communication disorders, for example, [[auditory processing disorder]] is not classified under the DSM or ICD-10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cirrie.buffalo.edu/encyclopedia/en/article/249/ |last1=Banai |first1=K |last2=Yifat |first2=R |title=Communication Disorders: Auditory Processing Disorders| year=2010| work=International Encyclopedia of Rehabilitation |editor=JH Stone |editor2=M Blouin | publisher=Center for International Rehabilitation Research Information and Exchange (CIRRIE) |accessdate=}}</ref>\nThe following diagnoses are included as communication disorders:\n* [[Expressive language disorder]] \u2013 characterized by difficulty expressing oneself beyond simple sentences and a limited vocabulary.

Archaeological evidence shows population continuity in coastal [[Dalmatia]] and [[Istria]]. In contrast, much of the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric]] hinterland appears to have been depopulated, as virtually all hilltop settlements, from [[Noricum]] to [[Dardania (Roman province)|Dardania]], were abandoned (only few appear destroyed) in the early 7th century. Although the dating of the earliest Slavic settlements is still disputed, there is a hiatus of almost a century. The origin, timing and nature of the Slavic migrations remain controversial, however, all available evidence points to the nearby [[Danube|Danubian]] and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] regions.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Curta|2010|p=323 \"If anything, the reconsideration of the problem in the light of the ''Making of the Slavs'' strongly suggests that the Slavs did not have to migrate from some distant Urheimat in order to become Slovenians and Croats.\"}}</ref>\n\n====Serbs ethnogenesis====\nThe ethnonym \"Croat\" is first attested during the 9th century CE,<ref name=\"harvtxt|Dzino|2010|p=175\">{{harvtxt|Dzino|2010|p=175}}</ref> in the charter of Duke [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Trpimir]]; and indeed begins to be widely attested throughout central and eastern Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Borri|2011|p=215}}</ref> Much uncertainty revolves around the exact circumstances of their appearance given the scarcity of literary sources during the 7th and 8th century \"[[Middle Ages|Dark Ages]]\".\n\nTraditionally, scholarship has placed the arrival of the Croats in the 7th century, primarily on the basis of the later Byzantine document ''De Administrando Imperio''. As such, the arrival of the Croats was seen as a second wave of Slavic migrations, which took over Dalmatia from [[Avar Khaganate|Avar hegemony]]. However, as early as the 1970s, scholars questioned the reliability of [[Porphyrogennetos|Porphyrogenitus]]' work, written as it was in the 10th century. Rather than being an accurate historical account, ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' more accurately reflects the political situation during the 10th century. It mainly served as Byzantine propaganda praising Emperor [[Heraclius]] for repopulating the [[Balkans]] (previously devastated by the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]]) with Croats, who were seen by the Byzantines as tributary peoples living on what had always been 'Roman land'.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Curta|2006|p=138}}</ref>\n\nScholars have hypothesized the name Serbs(''Srbin'') may be [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], thus suggesting that the Croatians were possibly a [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribe from the [[Pontus (region)|Pontic]] region who were part of a larger movement at the same time that the Slavs were moving toward the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. The major basis for this connection was the perceived similarity between ''Hrvat'' and [[Tanais Tablets|inscriptions]] from the [[Tanais]] dated to the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, mentioning the name ''Khoro(u)athos''. Similar arguments have been made for an alleged [[Goths|Gothic]]-Croat link. Whilst there is indeed possible evidence of population continuity between Gothic and Croatian times in parts of Dalmatia, the idea of a Gothic origin of Croats was more rooted in 20th century [[Usta\u0161e]] political aspirations than historical reality.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dzino|2010|p=20}}</ref>\n\nContemporary scholarship views the rise of \"Croats\" as an autochthonous, Dalmatian response to the demise of the Avar khanate and the encroachment of [[Francia|Frankish]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s into northern Dalmatia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=An\u010di\u0107|first1=Mladen|title=From Carolingian Official to Croatian Ruler -The Croats and the Carolingian Empire in the First Half of the Ninth Century|journal=Hortus Artium Medievalium|date=January 1997|volume=3|pages=7\u201313|doi=10.1484/J.HAM.2.305094|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/264513}}</ref> They appear to have been based around [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]] and [[Klis]], down to the [[Cetina]] and south of [[Liburnia]].

Although Duke Liutevid and his people are commonly seen as a \"Pannonian Croats\", he is, due to the lack of \"evidence that they had a sense of Croat identity\" referred to as ''dux Pannoniae Inferioris'', or simply a Slav, by contemporary sources.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dzino|2010|p=186}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Wolfram|2002}} Liudewit is usually considered the first Croatian prince we know of. To be true, there is no doubt that Constantine Porphyrogenitus has Dalmatia and parts of Slavonia populated by Croatians. But this author wrote more than a hundred years after the Frankish Royal annals which never mention the name of the Croatians although you will find a great many Slavic tribal names there. Therefore, if one applies the methods of an ethnogenetic interpretation, the Croatian Liudewit seems to be an anachronism.</ref> However, soon, the Croats became the dominant local power in northern Dalmatia, absorbing Liburnia and expanding their name by conquest and prestige. In the south, while having periods of independence, the Naretines also \"merged\" with Croats later under control of Croatian Kings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enciklopedija.lzmk.hr/clanak.aspx?id=27481|title=enciklopedija.lzmk.hr|website=enciklopedija.lzmk.hr|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>\nWith such expansion, Croatia soon became the dominant power and absorbed other polities between Frankish, [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and Byzantine empire.

Aided by [[Vojnomir of Pannonian Croatia|Vojnomir]] in 796, the first named Slavic Duke of Pannonia, the Franks wrested control of the region from the Avars before totally destroying the Avar realm in 803. After the death of [[Charlemagne]] in 814, Frankish influence decreased on the region, allowing Prince [[Ljudevit Posavski]] to raise a rebellion in 819.<ref name=\"Wolfram 2002\">{{Harvard citation text|Wolfram|2002}}</ref> The [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] [[margrave]]s sent armies in 820, 821 and 822, but each time they failed to crush the rebels.<ref name=\"Wolfram 2002\"/> Aided by Borna the Guduscan, the Franks eventually defeated Ljudevit, who withdrew his forces to the Serbs and conquered them, according to the Frankish Annals.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nFor much of the subsequent period, Savia was probably directly ruled by the Carinthian [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Duke Arnulf]], the future East Frankish King and Emperor. However, Frankish control was far from smooth. The [[Royal Frankish Annals]] mention several Bulgar raids, driving up the Sava and Drava rivers, as a result of a border dispute with the Franks, from 827. By a peace treaty in 845, the Franks were confirmed as rulers over [[Slavonia]], whilst [[Syrmia|Srijem]] remained under Bulgarian clientage. Later, the expanding power of [[Great Moravia]] also threatened Frankish control of the region. In an effort to halt their influence, the Franks sought alliance with the Magyars, and elevated the local Slavic leader [[Braslav of Croatia|Braslav]] in 892, as a more independent Duke over lower Pannonia.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn 896, his rule stretched from [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]] to the southern Croat dutchies, and included almost the whole of ex-Roman Pannonian provinces (whole 4). He probably died {{circa}} 900 fighting against his former allies, the Magyars.<ref name=\"Wolfram 2002\"/> The subsequent history of Savia again becomes mirky, and historians are not sure who controlled Savia during much of the 10th century. However, it is likely that the ruler [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], the first crowned King, was able to exert much control over Savia and adjacent areas during his reign. It is indeed at this time that sources first refer to a \"Pannonian Croatia\", appearing in the 10th century Byzantine work ''De Administrando Imperio''.<ref name=\"Wolfram 2002\"/>\n\n====Dalmatian Croats====\n\nIn the meantime, the [[Dalmatian Croat]]s were recorded to have been subject to the Kingdom of [[Italy]] under [[Lothair I]], since 828. The Croatian Prince [[Mislav of Croatia|Mislav]] (835\u2013845) built up a formidable navy, and in 839 signed a peace treaty with [[Pietro Tradonico]], [[doge of Venice]]. The Venetians soon proceeded to battle with the independent Slavic pirates of the [[Pagania]] region, but failed to defeat them. The Bulgarian king [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] (called by the [[Byzantine Empire]] Archont of Bulgaria after he made Christianity the official religion of Bulgaria) also waged a lengthy war against the Dalmatian Croats, trying to expand his state to the [[Adriatic]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe Croatian Prince [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Trpimir I]] (845\u2013864) succeeded Mislav. In 854, there was a great battle between Trpimir's forces and the Bulgars. Neither side emerged victorious, and the outcome was the exchange of gifts and the establishment of peace. Trpimir I managed to consolidate power over Dalmatia and much of the inland regions towards [[Pannonia]], while instituting counties as a way of controlling his subordinates (an idea he picked up from the Franks). The first known written mention of the Croats, dates from 4 March 852, in [[statute]] by Trpimir. Trpimir is remembered as the initiator of the [[Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty]], that ruled in Croatia, with interruptions, from 845 until 1091. After his death, an uprising was raised by a powerful nobleman from [[Knin]] \u2013 [[Domagoj of Croatia|Domagoj]], and his son [[Zdeslav of Croatia|Zdeslav]] was exiled with his brothers, Petar and [[Muncimir of Croatia|Muncimir]] to [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"John Van Antwerp Fine\">{{cite book|last=Fine|first=John Van Antwerp|title=The early medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the sixth to the late twelfth century|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y0NBxG9Id58C&pg=PA108|year=1991|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08149-3|page=257}}</ref>\n\nFacing a number of naval threats by [[Saracens]] and Byzantine Empire, the Croatian Prince Domagoj (864\u2013876) built up the Croatian navy again and helped the coalition of emperor [[Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis II]] and the Byzantine to conquer [[Bari]] in 871. During Domagoj's reign [[piracy]] was a common practice, and he forced the Venetians to start paying tribute for sailing near the eastern Adriatic coast. After Domagoj's death, Venetian chronicles named him \"The worst duke of Slavs\", while [[Pope John VIII]] referred to Domagoj in letters as \"Famous duke\". Domagoj's son, of unknown name, ruled shortly between 876 and 878 with his brothers. They continued the rebellion, attacked the western Istrian towns in 876, but were subsequently defeated by the Venetian navy. Their ground forces defeated the Pannonian duke [[Kocelj]] (861\u2013874) who was suzerain to the Franks, and thereby shed the Frankish vassal status. Wars of Domagoj and his son liberated Dalmatian Croats from supreme Franks rule. Zdeslav deposed him in 878 with the help of the Byzantines. He acknowledged the supreme rule of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Basil I]]. In 879, the [[Pope]] ask for help from prince Zdeslav for an armed escort for his delegates across southern Dalmatia and [[Zahumlje]],<ref name=\"Draganovi\u0107\">{{cite book|last=Draganovi\u0107|first=Krunoslav|page=191|title=Povijest Bosne i Hercegovine od najstarijih vremena do godine 1463|year=1991|publisher=Hrvatsko kulturno dru\u0161tvo Napredak}}</ref> but on early May 879, Zdeslav was killed near Knin in an uprising led by [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]], a relative of Domagoj, instigated by the [[Pope|Roman Pope]] fearing Byzantine power.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nBranimir's (879\u2013892) own actions were approved from the [[Holy See]] to bring the Croats further away from the influence of [[Byzantium]] and closer to Rome.

During the solemn divine service in [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] church in [[Rome]] in 879, Pope gave his blessing to the duke and the whole Croatian people, about which he informed Branimir in his letters, in which Branimir was recognized as the Duke of the Croats (''Dux Chroatorum'').<ref name=\"fine261\">{{cite book|last=Fine|first=John Van Antwerp|page=261|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YbS9QmwDC58C&pg=RA1-PA108&dq=vlastimir#v=onepage&q=Branimir&f=false|title=The early medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the sixth to the late twelfth century|year=1991|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08149-3}}</ref> During his reign, Croatia retained its sovereignty from both [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] imperial and [[Byzantine]] rule, and became a fully recognized state.<ref name=\"Hrvatski leksikon\">''Hrvatski leksikon'' (1996\u20131997) {{in lang|hr}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"antoljak\">Stjepan Antoljak, Pregled hrvatske povijesti, Split 1993., str. 43.</ref> After Branimir's death, Prince [[Muncimir of Croatia|Muncimir]] (892\u2013910), Zdeslav's brother, took control of Dalmatia and ruled it independently of both Rome and Byzantium as ''divino munere Croatorum dux'' (with God's help, duke of Croats).

According to ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', Tomislav's army and navy could have consisted approximately 100,000 [[infantry]] units, 60,000 cavaliers, and 80 larger (''sagina'') and 100 smaller [[warship]]s (''[[Kondura (ship)|condura]]''), but generally isn't taken as credible.<ref>''[[De Administrando Imperio]], Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos, 950''</ref> Croatian Kingdom as an ally of Byzantine Empire was in conflict with the rising [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] ruled by Tsar [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]].

[[Miroslav of Croatia|Miroslav]] (945\u2013949) was killed by his ban [[Pribina]] during an internal power struggle, losing part of islands and coastal cities. [[Mihajlo Kre\u0161imir II|Kre\u0161imir II]] (949\u2013969) kept particularly good relations with the Dalmatian cities, while his son [[Stjepan Dr\u017eislav]] (969\u2013997) established better relations with the Byzantine Empire and received a formal authority over Dalmatian cities. His three sons, [[Svetoslav Suronja|Svetoslav]] (997\u20131000), [[Kre\u0161imir III of Croatia|Kre\u0161imir III]] (1000\u20131030) and [[Gojslav of Croatia|Gojslav]] (1000\u20131020), opened a violent contest for the throne, weakening the state and further losing control. Kre\u0161imir III and his brother Gojslav co-ruled from 1000 until 1020, and attempted to restore control over lost Dalmatian cities now under Venetian control. Kre\u0161imir was succeeded by his son [[Stjepan I of Croatia|Stjepan I]] (1030\u20131058), who tried to reinforce the alliance with the Byzantines when he sent a segment of his naval fleet in war against the [[Arabs]] in 1032, in favour for their tolerance about conquering [[Zadar]] another Byzantine ally, from [[Venice]].

In addition, the Croatian nobles retained their lands and titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/143561/Croatia|title=Croatia|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> Coloman retained the institution of the Sabor and relieved the Croatians of taxes on their land.

Large [[fief]]s were granted to individuals who would defend them against outside incursions thereby creating a system for the defence of the entire state. However, by enabling the nobility to seize more economic and military power, the kingdom itself lost influence to the powerful noble families. In Croatia the [[House of \u0160ubi\u0107|\u0160ubi\u0107]] were one of the oldest Croatian noble families and would become particularly influential and important, ruling the area between [[Zrmanja]] and the [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]] rivers. The local noble family from [[Krk]] island (who later took the surname [[House of Frankopan|Frankopan]]) is often considered the second most important medieval family, as ruled over northern Adriatic and is responsible for the adoption of one of oldest European [[statutes]], [[Law codex of Vinodol]] (1288). Both families gave many native bans of Croatia. Other powerful families were [[House of Nelipi\u0107|Nelipi\u0107]] from [[Zagora (Croatia)|Dalmatian Zagora]] (14th\u201315th centuries); [[Ka\u010di\u0107]] who ruled over [[Pagania]] and were famous for piracy and wars against Venice (12th\u201313th centuries); Kurjakovi\u0107 family, a branch of the old Croatian noble family Gusi\u0107 from [[Krbava]] (14th\u201316th centuries); [[House of Baboni\u0107|Baboni\u0107i]] who ruled from western [[Kupa]] to eastern [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] and [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] rivers, and were bans of Slavonia (13th\u201314th centuries); [[House of Ilo\u010dki|Ilo\u010dki]] family who ruled over Slavonian stronghold-cities, and in the 15th century rose to power. During this period, the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] also acquired considerable property and assets in Croatia.\n\nIn the second half of the 13th century, during the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1d]] and [[Capetian House of Anjou|Anjou]] dynasty struggle, the \u0160ubi\u0107 family became hugely powerful under [[Paul I \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]], who was the longest Croatian Ban (1274\u20131312), conquering Bosnia and declaring himself \"Lord of all of Bosnia\" (1299\u20131312). He appointed his brother [[Mladen I \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Mladen I \u0160ubi\u0107]] as Ban of Bosnia (1299\u20131304), and helped [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles I]] from House of Anjou to be the King of Hungary. After his death in 1312, his son [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107]] was the Ban of Bosnia (1304\u20131322) and Ban of Croatia (1312\u20131322). The kings from House of Anjou intended to strengthen the kingdom by uniting their power and control, but to do so they had to diminish the power of the higher nobility. Charles I had already tried to crash the aristocratic privileges, intention finished by his son [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]] (1342\u20131382), relying on the lower nobility and towns. Both kings ruled without the Parliament, and inner nobility struggles only helped them in their intentions. This led to Mladen's defeat at the [[battle of Bliska]] in 1322 by a coalition of several Croatian noblemen and Dalmatian coastal towns with support of the King himself, in exchange of \u0160ubi\u0107's castle of [[Ostrovica, Croatia|Ostrovica]] for [[Zrin Castle]] in Central Croatia (thus this branch was named [[House of Zrinski|Zrinski]]) in 1347. Eventually, the Baboni\u0107 and Nelipi\u0107 families also succumbed to the king's offensive against nobility, but with the increasing process of power centralization, Louis managed to force Venice by the [[Treaty of Zadar]] in 1358 to give up their possessions in Dalmatia. When King Louis died without successor, the question of succession remained open. The kingdom once again entered the time of internal unrest. Besides King Louis's daughter [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary]], [[Charles III of Naples]] was the closest king male relative with claims to the throne. In February 1386, two months after his coronation, he was assassinated by order of the queen [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]]. His supporters, bans [[John of Palisna]], [[John Horvat]] and Stjepan Lackovi\u0107 planned a rebellion, and managed to capture and imprison Elizabeth and Mary. By orders of John of Palisna, Elizabeth was strangled. In retaliation, Magyars crowned Mary's husband [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nKing Sigismund's army was catastrophically defeated at the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] (1396) as the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman invasion]] was getting closer to the borders of the Hungarian-Croatian kingdom.  Without news about the king after the battle, the then ruling Croatian ban [[House of Lackovi\u0107|Stjepan Lackovi\u0107]] and nobles invited Charles III's son [[Ladislaus of Naples]] to be the new king.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} This resulted with [[Bloody Sabor of Kri\u017eevci]] in 1397, lose of interest for the crown by Ladislaus and selling of Dalmatia to Venice in 1403, and spreading of Croatian name to the north, while of Slavonia to the east.

This caused unrest among the Croatian and Hungarian nobility which plotted against the emperor. Nikola Zrinski participated in launching the conspiracy which later became to be known as the [[Magnate conspiracy]], but he soon died, and the rebellion was continued by his brother, Croatian ban [[Petar Zrinski]], [[Fran Krsto Frankopan]] and [[Ferenc Wessel\u00e9nyi]]. Petar Zrinski, along the conspirators, went on a wide secret diplomatic negotiations with a number of nations, including [[Louis XIV of France]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], the [[Republic of Venice]] and even the [[Ottoman Empire]], to free Croatia from the Habsburg sovereignty.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nImperial spies uncovered the conspiracy and on 30 April 1671 executed four esteemed Croatian and Hungarian noblemen involved in it, including Zrinski and Frankopan in [[Wiener Neustadt]].

Subsequently, the empress made significant contributions to Croatian matters, by making several changes in the feudal and tax system, administrative control of the Military Frontier, in 1745 administratively united Slavonia with Croatia and in 1767 organized Croatian royal council with the ban on head, however, she ignored and eventually disbanded it in 1779, and Croatia was relegated to just one seat in the governing council of Hungary, held by the [[ban (title)|ban]] of Croatia. To fight the Austrian centralization and absolutism, Croats passed their rights to the united government in Hungary, thus to together resist the intentions from Vienna. But the connection with Hungary soon adversely affected the position of Croats, because Magyars in the spring of their nationalism tried to Magyarize Croats, and make Croatia a part of a united Hungary. Because of this pretensions, the constant struggles between Croats and Magyars emerged, and lasted until 1918. Croats were fighting in unfavorable conditions, against both Vienna and Budapest, while divided on Banska Hrvatska, Dalmatia and Military Frontier. In such a time, with the fall of the [[Venetian Republic]] in 1797, its possessions in eastern [[Adriatic]] mostly came under the authority of France which passed its rights to Austria the same year.

The movement attracted a number of influential figures and produced some important advances in the [[Croatian language]] and culture. The champion of the Illyrian movement was [[Ljudevit Gaj]] who also reformed and standardized the Croatian literary language.

This deterred the movement's progress but it couldn't stop the changes in the society that had already started.

The red-white-blue tricolor was chosen as those were the colours of Pan-Slavism, popular in the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe [[Coat of arms of Croatia|coat-of-arms]] consists of the traditional red and white squares or ''grb'', which simply means 'coat-of-arms'. It has been used to symbolise the Croats for centuries; some{{Who|date=March 2012}} speculate that it was derived from [[Red Croatia|Red]] and [[White Croatia]], historic lands of the Croatian tribe but there is no generally accepted proof for this theory. The current design added the five crowning shields, which represent the historical regions from which Croatia originated. The red and white checkerboard has been a symbol of Croatian kings since at least the 10th century, ranging in number from 3\u00d73 to 8\u00d78, but most commonly 5\u00d75, like the current coat. The oldest source confirming the coat-of-arms as an official symbol is a genealogy of the [[Habsburg]]s dating during 1512\u201318. In 1525 it was used on a votive medal. The oldest known example of the ''\u0161ahovnica'' (chessboard in Croatian) in Croatia is to be found on the wings of four falcons on a baptismal font donated by king [[Peter Kre\u0161imir IV of Croatia]] (1058\u20131074) to the Archbishop of [[Split, Croatia|Split]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nUnlike in many countries, Croatian design more commonly uses symbolism from the coat of arms, rather than from the Croatian flag. This is partly due to the geometric design of the shield which makes it appropriate for use in many graphic contexts (e.g. the insignia of [[Croatia Airlines]] or the design of the shirt for the [[Croatia national football team]]), and partly because neighbouring countries like Slovenia and Serbia use the same [[Pan-Slavic colours]] on their flags as Croatia. The [[Croatian interlace]] (''pleter'' or ''troplet'') is also a commonly used symbol which originally comes from monasteries built between the 9th and 12th century. The interlace can be seen in various emblems and is also featured in modern [[Croatian military ranks]] and Croatian police ranks insignia.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==Communities==\nIn Croatia (the [[nation state]]), 3.9&nbsp;million people identify themselves as Croats, and constitute about 90.4% of the population.

In addition, some [[emigrants]] left for political reasons.

Migrant communities already established in the Americas, Oceania, and across Europe grew as a result.\n\nThe count for diaspora is approximate because of incomplete statistical records and [[naturalization]].

Archaeological evidence shows population continuity in coastal [[Dalmatia]] and [[Istria]]. In contrast, much of the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric]] hinterland appears to have been depopulated, as virtually all hilltop settlements, from [[Noricum]] to [[Dardania (Roman province)|Dardania]], were abandoned (only few appear destroyed) in the early 7th century. Although the dating of the earliest Slavic settlements is still disputed, there is a hiatus of almost a century. The origin, timing and nature of the Slavic migrations remain controversial, however, all available evidence points to the nearby [[Danube|Danubian]] and [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathian]] regions.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Curta|2010|p=323 \"If anything, the reconsideration of the problem in the light of the ''Making of the Slavs'' strongly suggests that the Slavs did not have to migrate from some distant Urheimat in order to become Slovenians and Croats.\"}}</ref>\n\n====Croat ethnogenesis====\nThe ethnonym \"Croat\" is first attested during the 9th century CE,<ref name=\"harvtxt|Dzino|2010|p=175\">{{harvtxt|Dzino|2010|p=175}}</ref> in the charter of Duke [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Trpimir]]; and indeed begins to be widely attested throughout central and eastern Europe during the 9th and 10th centuries.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Borri|2011|p=215}}</ref> Much uncertainty revolves around the exact circumstances of their appearance given the scarcity of literary sources during the 7th and 8th century \"[[Middle Ages|Dark Ages]]\".\n\nTraditionally, scholarship has placed the arrival of the Croats in the 7th century, primarily on the basis of the later Byzantine document ''De Administrando Imperio''. As such, the arrival of the Croats was seen as a second wave of Slavic migrations, which took over Dalmatia from [[Avar Khaganate|Avar hegemony]]. However, as early as the 1970s, scholars questioned the reliability of [[Porphyrogennetos|Porphyrogenitus]]' work, written as it was in the 10th century. Rather than being an accurate historical account, ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' more accurately reflects the political situation during the 10th century. It mainly served as Byzantine propaganda praising Emperor [[Heraclius]] for repopulating the [[Balkans]] (previously devastated by the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]]) with Croats, who were seen by the Byzantines as tributary peoples living on what had always been 'Roman land'.<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Curta|2006|p=138}}</ref>\n\nScholars have hypothesized the name Croat (''Hrvat'') may be [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]], thus suggesting that the Croatians were possibly a [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribe from the [[Pontus (region)|Pontic]] region who were part of a larger movement at the same time that the Slavs were moving toward the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. The major basis for this connection was the perceived similarity between ''Hrvat'' and [[Tanais Tablets|inscriptions]] from the [[Tanais]] dated to the 2nd and 3rd centuries CE, mentioning the name ''Khoro(u)athos''. Similar arguments have been made for an alleged [[Goths|Gothic]]-Croat link. Whilst there is indeed possible evidence of population continuity between Gothic and Croatian times in parts of Dalmatia, the idea of a Gothic origin of Croats was more rooted in 20th century [[Usta\u0161e]] political aspirations than historical reality.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dzino|2010|p=20}}</ref>\n\nContemporary scholarship views the rise of \"Croats\" as an autochthonous, Dalmatian response to the demise of the Avar khanate and the encroachment of [[Francia|Frankish]] and [[Byzantine Empire]]s into northern Dalmatia.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=An\u010di\u0107|first1=Mladen|title=From Carolingian Official to Croatian Ruler -The Croats and the Carolingian Empire in the First Half of the Ninth Century|journal=Hortus Artium Medievalium|date=January 1997|volume=3|pages=7\u201313|doi=10.1484/J.HAM.2.305094|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/264513}}</ref> They appear to have been based around [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]] and [[Klis]], down to the [[Cetina]] and south of [[Liburnia]].

These included the [[Guduscani|Guduscans]] (based in Liburnia), the [[Narentines]] (around the Cetina and [[Neretva]]) and the Sorabi (Serbs) who ruled some other eastern parts of ex-Roman \"Dalmatia\".<ref>{{Harvard citation text|Budak|2008|p=223}}</ref> Also prominent in the territory of future Croatia was the polity of Prince Liutevid, who ruled the territories between the [[Drava]] and [[Sava]] rivers (\"[[Pannonia Inferior]]\"), centred from his fort at [[Sisak]]. Although Duke Liutevid and his people are commonly seen as a \"Pannonian Croats\", he is, due to the lack of \"evidence that they had a sense of Croat identity\" referred to as ''dux Pannoniae Inferioris'', or simply a Slav, by contemporary sources.<ref>{{harvtxt|Dzino|2010|p=186}}</ref><ref>{{harvtxt|Wolfram|2002}} Liudewit is usually considered the first Croatian prince we know of. To be true, there is no doubt that Constantine Porphyrogenitus has Dalmatia and parts of Slavonia populated by Croatians. But this author wrote more than a hundred years after the Frankish Royal annals which never mention the name of the Croatians although you will find a great many Slavic tribal names there. Therefore, if one applies the methods of an ethnogenetic interpretation, the Croatian Liudewit seems to be an anachronism.</ref> However, soon, the Croats became the dominant local power in northern Dalmatia, absorbing Liburnia and expanding their name by conquest and prestige. In the south, while having periods of independence, the Naretines also \"merged\" with Croats later under control of Croatian Kings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enciklopedija.lzmk.hr/clanak.aspx?id=27481|title=enciklopedija.lzmk.hr|website=enciklopedija.lzmk.hr|accessdate=12 December 2017}}</ref>\nWith such expansion, Croatia soon became the dominant power and absorbed other polities between Frankish, [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] and Byzantine empire.

Each vied for control of the Northwest Balkan regions. Nevertheless, two independent Slavic dukedoms emerged sometime during the 9th century: the [[Principality of Dalmatian Croatia|Croat Duchy]] and [[Duchy of Pannonian Croatia|Principality of Lower Pannonia]].\n\n====Pannonian Principality (\"Savia\")====\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}\nHaving been under Avar control, lower Pannonia became a march of the [[Carolingian Empire]] around 800. Aided by [[Vojnomir of Pannonian Croatia|Vojnomir]] in 796, the first named Slavic Duke of Pannonia, the Franks wrested control of the region from the Avars before totally destroying the Avar realm in 803. After the death of [[Charlemagne]] in 814, Frankish influence decreased on the region, allowing Prince [[Ljudevit Posavski]] to raise a rebellion in 819.<ref name=\"Wolfram 2002\">{{Harvard citation text|Wolfram|2002}}</ref> The [[Frankish Empire|Frankish]] [[margrave]]s sent armies in 820, 821 and 822, but each time they failed to crush the rebels.<ref name=\"Wolfram 2002\"/> Aided by Borna the Guduscan, the Franks eventually defeated Ljudevit, who withdrew his forces to the Serbs and conquered them, according to the Frankish Annals.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nFor much of the subsequent period, Savia was probably directly ruled by the Carinthian [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Duke Arnulf]], the future East Frankish King and Emperor. However, Frankish control was far from smooth. The [[Royal Frankish Annals]] mention several Bulgar raids, driving up the Sava and Drava rivers, as a result of a border dispute with the Franks, from 827. By a peace treaty in 845, the Franks were confirmed as rulers over [[Slavonia]], whilst [[Syrmia|Srijem]] remained under Bulgarian clientage. Later, the expanding power of [[Great Moravia]] also threatened Frankish control of the region. In an effort to halt their influence, the Franks sought alliance with the Magyars, and elevated the local Slavic leader [[Braslav of Croatia|Braslav]] in 892, as a more independent Duke over lower Pannonia.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nIn 896, his rule stretched from [[Vienna]] and [[Budapest]] to the southern Croat dutchies, and included almost the whole of ex-Roman Pannonian provinces (whole 4). He probably died {{circa}} 900 fighting against his former allies, the Magyars.<ref name=\"Wolfram 2002\"/> The subsequent history of Savia again becomes mirky, and historians are not sure who controlled Savia during much of the 10th century. However, it is likely that the ruler [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]], the first crowned King, was able to exert much control over Savia and adjacent areas during his reign. It is indeed at this time that sources first refer to a \"Pannonian Croatia\", appearing in the 10th century Byzantine work ''De Administrando Imperio''.<ref name=\"Wolfram 2002\"/>\n\n====Dalmatian Croats====\n\nIn the meantime, the [[Dalmatian Croat]]s were recorded to have been subject to the Kingdom of [[Italy]] under [[Lothair I]], since 828. The Croatian Prince [[Mislav of Croatia|Mislav]] (835\u2013845) built up a formidable navy, and in 839 signed a peace treaty with [[Pietro Tradonico]], [[doge of Venice]]. The Venetians soon proceeded to battle with the independent Slavic pirates of the [[Pagania]] region, but failed to defeat them. The Bulgarian king [[Boris I of Bulgaria|Boris I]] (called by the [[Byzantine Empire]] Archont of Bulgaria after he made Christianity the official religion of Bulgaria) also waged a lengthy war against the Dalmatian Croats, trying to expand his state to the [[Adriatic]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nThe Croatian Prince [[Trpimir I of Croatia|Trpimir I]] (845\u2013864) succeeded Mislav. In 854, there was a great battle between Trpimir's forces and the Bulgars. Neither side emerged victorious, and the outcome was the exchange of gifts and the establishment of peace. Trpimir I managed to consolidate power over Dalmatia and much of the inland regions towards [[Pannonia]], while instituting counties as a way of controlling his subordinates (an idea he picked up from the Franks). The first known written mention of the Croats, dates from 4 March 852, in [[statute]] by Trpimir. Trpimir is remembered as the initiator of the [[Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty]], that ruled in Croatia, with interruptions, from 845 until 1091. After his death, an uprising was raised by a powerful nobleman from [[Knin]] \u2013 [[Domagoj of Croatia|Domagoj]], and his son [[Zdeslav of Croatia|Zdeslav]] was exiled with his brothers, Petar and [[Muncimir of Croatia|Muncimir]] to [[Constantinople]].<ref name=\"John Van Antwerp Fine\">{{cite book|last=Fine|first=John Van Antwerp|title=The early medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the sixth to the late twelfth century|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y0NBxG9Id58C&pg=PA108|year=1991|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08149-3|page=257}}</ref>\n\nFacing a number of naval threats by [[Saracens]] and Byzantine Empire, the Croatian Prince Domagoj (864\u2013876) built up the Croatian navy again and helped the coalition of emperor [[Louis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis II]] and the Byzantine to conquer [[Bari]] in 871. During Domagoj's reign [[piracy]] was a common practice, and he forced the Venetians to start paying tribute for sailing near the eastern Adriatic coast. After Domagoj's death, Venetian chronicles named him \"The worst duke of Slavs\", while [[Pope John VIII]] referred to Domagoj in letters as \"Famous duke\". Domagoj's son, of unknown name, ruled shortly between 876 and 878 with his brothers. They continued the rebellion, attacked the western Istrian towns in 876, but were subsequently defeated by the Venetian navy. Their ground forces defeated the Pannonian duke [[Kocelj]] (861\u2013874) who was suzerain to the Franks, and thereby shed the Frankish vassal status. Wars of Domagoj and his son liberated Dalmatian Croats from supreme Franks rule. Zdeslav deposed him in 878 with the help of the Byzantines. He acknowledged the supreme rule of [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Basil I]]. In 879, the [[Pope]] ask for help from prince Zdeslav for an armed escort for his delegates across southern Dalmatia and [[Zahumlje]],<ref name=\"Draganovi\u0107\">{{cite book|last=Draganovi\u0107|first=Krunoslav|page=191|title=Povijest Bosne i Hercegovine od najstarijih vremena do godine 1463|year=1991|publisher=Hrvatsko kulturno dru\u0161tvo Napredak}}</ref> but on early May 879, Zdeslav was killed near Knin in an uprising led by [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]], a relative of Domagoj, instigated by the [[Pope|Roman Pope]] fearing Byzantine power.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nBranimir's (879\u2013892) own actions were approved from the [[Holy See]] to bring the Croats further away from the influence of [[Byzantium]] and closer to Rome.

During the solemn divine service in [[St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's]] church in [[Rome]] in 879, Pope gave his blessing to the duke and the whole Croatian people, about which he informed Branimir in his letters, in which Branimir was recognized as the Duke of the Croats (''Dux Chroatorum'').<ref name=\"fine261\">{{cite book|last=Fine|first=John Van Antwerp|page=261|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YbS9QmwDC58C&pg=RA1-PA108&dq=vlastimir#v=onepage&q=Branimir&f=false|title=The early medieval Balkans: a critical survey from the sixth to the late twelfth century|year=1991|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=978-0-472-08149-3}}</ref> During his reign, Croatia retained its sovereignty from both [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] imperial and [[Byzantine]] rule, and became a fully recognized state.<ref name=\"Hrvatski leksikon\">''Hrvatski leksikon'' (1996\u20131997) {{in lang|hr}}{{full citation needed|date=November 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"antoljak\">Stjepan Antoljak, Pregled hrvatske povijesti, Split 1993., str. 43.</ref> After Branimir's death, Prince [[Muncimir of Croatia|Muncimir]] (892\u2013910), Zdeslav's brother, took control of Dalmatia and ruled it independently of both Rome and Byzantium as ''divino munere Croatorum dux'' (with God's help, duke of Croats).

The chief piece of evidence that Tomislav was crowned king comes in the form of a letter dated 925, surviving only in 16th-century copies, from [[Pope John X]] calling Tomislav ''[[King of Croatia|rex Chroatorum]]''. According to ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', Tomislav's army and navy could have consisted approximately 100,000 [[infantry]] units, 60,000 cavaliers, and 80 larger (''sagina'') and 100 smaller [[warship]]s (''[[Kondura (ship)|condura]]''), but generally isn't taken as credible.<ref>''[[De Administrando Imperio]], Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitos, 950''</ref> Croatian Kingdom as an ally of Byzantine Empire was in conflict with the rising [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]] ruled by Tsar [[Simeon I of Bulgaria|Simeon I]].

Kre\u0161imir III and his brother Gojslav co-ruled from 1000 until 1020, and attempted to restore control over lost Dalmatian cities now under Venetian control.

In addition, the Croatian nobles retained their lands and titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/143561/Croatia|title=Croatia|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> Coloman retained the institution of the Sabor and relieved the Croatians of taxes on their land.

Large [[fief]]s were granted to individuals who would defend them against outside incursions thereby creating a system for the defence of the entire state. However, by enabling the nobility to seize more economic and military power, the kingdom itself lost influence to the powerful noble families. In Croatia the [[House of \u0160ubi\u0107|\u0160ubi\u0107]] were one of the oldest Croatian noble families and would become particularly influential and important, ruling the area between [[Zrmanja]] and the [[Krka (Croatia)|Krka]] rivers. The local noble family from [[Krk]] island (who later took the surname [[House of Frankopan|Frankopan]]) is often considered the second most important medieval family, as ruled over northern Adriatic and is responsible for the adoption of one of oldest European [[statutes]], [[Law codex of Vinodol]] (1288). Both families gave many native bans of Croatia. Other powerful families were [[House of Nelipi\u0107|Nelipi\u0107]] from [[Zagora (Croatia)|Dalmatian Zagora]] (14th\u201315th centuries); [[Ka\u010di\u0107]] who ruled over [[Pagania]] and were famous for piracy and wars against Venice (12th\u201313th centuries); Kurjakovi\u0107 family, a branch of the old Croatian noble family Gusi\u0107 from [[Krbava]] (14th\u201316th centuries); [[House of Baboni\u0107|Baboni\u0107i]] who ruled from western [[Kupa]] to eastern [[Vrbas (river)|Vrbas]] and [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] rivers, and were bans of Slavonia (13th\u201314th centuries); [[House of Ilo\u010dki|Ilo\u010dki]] family who ruled over Slavonian stronghold-cities, and in the 15th century rose to power. During this period, the [[Knights Templar]] and the [[Knights Hospitaller]] also acquired considerable property and assets in Croatia.\n\nIn the second half of the 13th century, during the [[\u00c1rp\u00e1d dynasty|\u00c1rp\u00e1d]] and [[Capetian House of Anjou|Anjou]] dynasty struggle, the \u0160ubi\u0107 family became hugely powerful under [[Paul I \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]], who was the longest Croatian Ban (1274\u20131312), conquering Bosnia and declaring himself \"Lord of all of Bosnia\" (1299\u20131312). He appointed his brother [[Mladen I \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Mladen I \u0160ubi\u0107]] as Ban of Bosnia (1299\u20131304), and helped [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles I]] from House of Anjou to be the King of Hungary. After his death in 1312, his son [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107]] was the Ban of Bosnia (1304\u20131322) and Ban of Croatia (1312\u20131322). The kings from House of Anjou intended to strengthen the kingdom by uniting their power and control, but to do so they had to diminish the power of the higher nobility. Charles I had already tried to crash the aristocratic privileges, intention finished by his son [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]] (1342\u20131382), relying on the lower nobility and towns. Both kings ruled without the Parliament, and inner nobility struggles only helped them in their intentions. This led to Mladen's defeat at the [[battle of Bliska]] in 1322 by a coalition of several Croatian noblemen and Dalmatian coastal towns with support of the King himself, in exchange of \u0160ubi\u0107's castle of [[Ostrovica, Croatia|Ostrovica]] for [[Zrin Castle]] in Central Croatia (thus this branch was named [[House of Zrinski|Zrinski]]) in 1347. Eventually, the Baboni\u0107 and Nelipi\u0107 families also succumbed to the king's offensive against nobility, but with the increasing process of power centralization, Louis managed to force Venice by the [[Treaty of Zadar]] in 1358 to give up their possessions in Dalmatia. When King Louis died without successor, the question of succession remained open. The kingdom once again entered the time of internal unrest. Besides King Louis's daughter [[Mary, Queen of Hungary|Mary]], [[Charles III of Naples]] was the closest king male relative with claims to the throne. In February 1386, two months after his coronation, he was assassinated by order of the queen [[Elizabeth of Bosnia]]. His supporters, bans [[John of Palisna]], [[John Horvat]] and Stjepan Lackovi\u0107 planned a rebellion, and managed to capture and imprison Elizabeth and Mary. By orders of John of Palisna, Elizabeth was strangled. In retaliation, Magyars crowned Mary's husband [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nKing Sigismund's army was catastrophically defeated at the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] (1396) as the [[Rise of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman invasion]] was getting closer to the borders of the Hungarian-Croatian kingdom.  Without news about the king after the battle, the then ruling Croatian ban [[House of Lackovi\u0107|Stjepan Lackovi\u0107]] and nobles invited Charles III's son [[Ladislaus of Naples]] to be the new king.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} This resulted with [[Bloody Sabor of Kri\u017eevci]] in 1397, lose of interest for the crown by Ladislaus and selling of Dalmatia to Venice in 1403, and spreading of Croatian name to the north, while of Slavonia to the east.

Petar Zrinski, along the conspirators, went on a wide secret diplomatic negotiations with a number of nations, including [[Louis XIV of France]], the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]], the [[Republic of Venice]] and even the [[Ottoman Empire]], to free Croatia from the Habsburg sovereignty.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nImperial spies uncovered the conspiracy and on 30 April 1671 executed four esteemed Croatian and Hungarian noblemen involved in it, including Zrinski and Frankopan in [[Wiener Neustadt]].

Between 1670 and the revolution of 1848, there would be only 2 bans of Croatian nationality.

Meanwhile, with the victories over Turks, Habsburgs all the more insistent they spent centralization and germanization, new regained lands in liberated Slavonia started giving to foreign families as feudal goods, at the expense of domestic element. Because of this the Croatian Sabor was losing its significance, and the nobility less attended it, yet went only to the one in Hungary.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:Dragutin Weing\u00e4rtner, Hrvatski sabor 1848. god.jpg|thumb|left|The Croatian ''Sabor'' (Parliament) in 1848, by Dragutin Weing\u00e4rtner]]\nIn the 18th century, Croatia was one of the crown lands that supported Emperor [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles]]'s [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713]] and supported Empress [[Maria Theresa]] in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] of 1741\u201348. Subsequently, the empress made significant contributions to Croatian matters, by making several changes in the feudal and tax system, administrative control of the Military Frontier, in 1745 administratively united Slavonia with Croatia and in 1767 organized Croatian royal council with the ban on head, however, she ignored and eventually disbanded it in 1779, and Croatia was relegated to just one seat in the governing council of Hungary, held by the [[ban (title)|ban]] of Croatia. To fight the Austrian centralization and absolutism, Croats passed their rights to the united government in Hungary, thus to together resist the intentions from Vienna. But the connection with Hungary soon adversely affected the position of Croats, because Magyars in the spring of their nationalism tried to Magyarize Croats, and make Croatia a part of a united Hungary. Because of this pretensions, the constant struggles between Croats and Magyars emerged, and lasted until 1918. Croats were fighting in unfavorable conditions, against both Vienna and Budapest, while divided on Banska Hrvatska, Dalmatia and Military Frontier. In such a time, with the fall of the [[Venetian Republic]] in 1797, its possessions in eastern [[Adriatic]] mostly came under the authority of France which passed its rights to Austria the same year. Eight years later they were restored to France as the [[Illyrian Provinces]], but won back to the Austrian crown 1815.

The champion of the Illyrian movement was [[Ljudevit Gaj]] who also reformed and standardized the Croatian literary language.

This deterred the movement's progress but it couldn't stop the changes in the society that had already started. On 25 March 1848, was conducted a political petition \"''Zahtijevanja naroda''\", which program included thirty national, social and liberal principles, like Croatian national independence, annexation of Dalmatia and Military Frontier, independence from Hungary as far as finance, language, education, freedom of speech and writing, religion, nullification of serfdom etc. In the [[revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire]], the Croatian [[Ban (title)|Ban]] [[Josip Jela\u010di\u0107|Jela\u010di\u0107]] cooperated with the Austrians in quenching the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] by leading a military campaign into Hungary, successful until the [[Battle of P\u00e1kozd]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nCroatia was later subject to Hungarian hegemony under ban [[Levin Rauch]] when the Empire was transformed into a dual monarchy of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1867.

The earliest record of contact between the [[Pope]] and the Croats dates from a mid-7th century entry in the ''[[Liber Pontificalis]]''. [[Pope John IV]] (John the Dalmatian, 640\u2013642) sent an abbot named Martin to [[Dalmatia]] and [[Istria]] in order to pay ransom for some prisoners and for the remains of old Christian martyrs. This abbot is recorded to have travelled through Dalmatia with the help of the Croatian leaders, and he established the foundation for the future relations between the Pope and the Croats.\n\nThe beginnings of the [[Christianization]] are also disputed in the historical texts: the Byzantine texts talk of duke Porin who started this at the incentive of emperor [[Heraclius]] (610\u2013641), then of Duke Porga who mainly Christianized his people after the influence of missionaries from Rome, while the national tradition recalls Christianization during the rule of Dalmatian Duke [[Borna of Croatia|Borna]] (810\u2013821).

The [[Latin Rite]] prevailed over the [[Byzantine Rite]] rather early due to numerous interventions from the [[Holy See]]. There were numerous Roman Catholic synods held in Dalmatia in the 11th century, particularly after the [[East-West Schism]] of 1054, during the course of which the use of the Latin rite was run roughshod over the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom and the Divine Liturgy of St. Basil.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==Culture==\n\n===Tradition===\n{{Main|Culture of Croatia}}\n[[File:Akar 1.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|[[Sinjska alka|Alka]] is a traditional knights' competition.]]\nThe area settled by Croats has a large diversity of historical and cultural influences, as well as diversity of terrain and geography.

The oldest known example of the ''\u0161ahovnica'' (chessboard in Croatian) in Croatia is to be found on the wings of four falcons on a baptismal font donated by king [[Peter Kre\u0161imir IV of Croatia]] (1058\u20131074) to the Archbishop of [[Split, Croatia|Split]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nUnlike in many countries, Croatian design more commonly uses symbolism from the coat of arms, rather than from the Croatian flag. This is partly due to the geometric design of the shield which makes it appropriate for use in many graphic contexts (e.g. the insignia of [[Croatia Airlines]] or the design of the shirt for the [[Croatia national football team]]), and partly because neighbouring countries like Slovenia and Serbia use the same [[Pan-Slavic colours]] on their flags as Croatia. The [[Croatian interlace]] (''pleter'' or ''troplet'') is also a commonly used symbol which originally comes from monasteries built between the 9th and 12th century. The interlace can be seen in various emblems and is also featured in modern [[Croatian military ranks]] and Croatian police ranks insignia.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\n==Communities==\nIn Croatia (the [[nation state]]), 3.9&nbsp;million people identify themselves as Croats, and constitute about 90.4% of the population.

The Croat diaspora was the consequence of either mostly economic or political ([[coercion]] or expulsions) reasons:\n* To other European countries ([[Slovenia]], [[Croats of Italy|Italy]], [[Croatians in Austria|Austria]], [[Slovakia]], [[Croats in Germany|Germany]], [[Croats of Hungary|Hungary]]), caused by the conquering of [[Ottoman Turks]], when Croats as Roman Catholics were oppressed.\n* To the Americas (largely to [[Croatian Canadians|Canada]], the [[Croatian Americans|United States of America]], [[Croatian Chilean|Chile]], and [[Croatian Argentine|Argentina]], with smaller communities in [[Croatian Brazilian|Brazil]], [[Croatian Peruvian|Peru]], and [[Croatian Ecuadorian|Ecuador]], as well as to [[Croatian Australian|Australia]], [[Croats in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[South Africa]]) in the end of 19th and early 20th century, large numbers of Croats emigrated particularly for economic reasons.\n* A further, larger wave of emigration, this time for political reasons, took place after the end of the [[Second World War|World War II]]. At this time, both collaborators of the [[Usta\u0161a]] regime and those who did not want to live under a communist regime fled the country, to the Americas and [[Oceania]] once more.\n* As immigrant workers, particularly to Germany, Austria, and Switzerland in the 1960s and 1970s. In addition, some [[emigrants]] left for political reasons. This migration made it possible for communist [[Yugoslavia]] to achieve lower unemployment and at the same time the money sent home by emigrants to their families provided an enormous source of foreign exchange income.\n* The last large wave of Croat emigration occurred during and after the [[Yugoslav Wars]] (1991\u20131995). Migrant communities already established in the Americas, Oceania, and across Europe grew as a result.\n\nThe count for diaspora is approximate because of incomplete statistical records and [[naturalization]]. Overseas, the [[United States]] contains the largest [[Croatian Americans|Croatian emigrant group]] (414,714 according to the 2010 census), mostly in [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Illinois]] and [[California]], with a sizable community in [[Alaska]], followed by [[Croatian Australian|Australia]] (133,268 according to the 2016 census, with concentrations in [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Perth]]) and [[Canada]] (133,965 according to the 2016 census, mainly in [[Southern Ontario]], [[British Columbia]] and [[Alberta]]).\n\nVarious estimations put the total number of Americans and Canadians with at least some Croatian ancestry at 2 million, many of whom do not identify as such in the countries' censuses.<ref name=\"Farkas\">{{cite book|last=Farkas|first=Evelyn|page=99|title=Fractured States and U.S. Foreign Policy.

Meurs had 9,200 flight hours, of which 95 hours were on the 747. Schreuder had 17,031 flight hours, of which 543 hours were on the 747.\n\nThe aircraft was a Boeing 747-206B, registration PH-BUF, named ''Rijn ([[Rhine]])''. The KLM jet was carrying 14 crew members and 235 passengers, including 52 children. Most of the KLM passengers were Dutch; also on board were 4 Germans, 2 Austrians and 2 Americans. After the aircraft landed at Tenerife, the passengers were transported to the airport terminal.

Of the 380 passengers (mostly of retirement age, but including two children), 14 had boarded in New York, where the crew was also changed. The new crew consisted of captain Victor Grubbs, age 56, first officer Robert Bragg, age 39, flight engineer George Warns, age 46, and 13 flight attendants.

Instead, departing aircraft needed to taxi along the runway to position themselves for takeoff, a procedure known as a [[backtaxi]] or backtrack.<ref name=ASN/>\n\nThe authorities reopened Gran Canaria airport once the bomb threat had been contained. The Pan Am plane was ready to depart from Tenerife, but access to the runway was being obstructed by the KLM plane and a refueling vehicle; the KLM captain had decided to fully refuel at Los Rodeos instead of Las Palmas, apparently to save time. The Pan Am aircraft was unable to maneuver around the refueling KLM, in order to reach the runway for takeoff, due to a lack of safe clearance between the two planes, which was just {{convert|12|ft|order=flip|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"Air Disaster Volume 1\">{{cite book |title=Air Disaster, Volume 1 |first=Macarthur |last=Job |authorlink=Macarthur Job |date=January 1995 |pages=164\u2013180 |isbn=978-1875671113 |publisher=[[Chronicle Publishing Company|Motorbooks International]] }}</ref> The refueling took about 35 minutes, after which the passengers were brought back to the aircraft. The search for a missing Dutch family of four, who had not returned to the waiting KLM plane, delayed the flight even further. A tour guide had chosen not to reboard for the flight to Las Palmas, because she lived on Tenerife and thought it impractical to fly to Gran Canaria only to return to Tenerife the next day. She was therefore not on the KLM plane when the accident happened, and she would be the only survivor of those who flew from Amsterdam to Tenerife on Flight 4805.\n\n=== Taxiing and takeoff preparations ===\nThe tower instructed the KLM to taxi down the entire length of the runway and then make a 180-degree turn to get into takeoff position.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.project-tenerife.com/engels/PDF/Tenerife.pdf |title=Official report }}&nbsp;{{small|(5.98&nbsp;MB)}}, p. 2 (PDF p. 5 of 63)</ref> While the KLM was backtaxiing on the runway, the controller asked the flight crew to report when it was ready to copy the [[Instrument flight rules#Separation and clearance|ATC clearance]].

The red star indicates the location of impact. Not to scale.]]\nShortly afterward, the Pan Am was instructed to follow the KLM down the same runway, exit it by taking the third exit on their left and then use the parallel taxiway. Initially, the crew was unclear as to whether the controller had told them to take the first or third exit. The crew asked for clarification and the controller responded emphatically by replying: \"The third one, sir; one, two, three; third, third one.\" The crew began the taxi and proceeded to identify the unmarked taxiways using an airport diagram as they reached them.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.project-tenerife.com/engels/PDF/Tenerife.pdf |title=Official report }}&nbsp;{{small|(5.98&nbsp;MB)}}, p. 3 (PDF p. 6 of 63)</ref>\n\nThe crew successfully identified the first two taxiways (C-1 and C-2), but their discussion in the cockpit never indicated that they had sighted the third taxiway (C-3), which they had been instructed to use.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.project-tenerife.com/engels/PDF/Tenerife.pdf |title=Official report }}&nbsp;{{small|(5.98&nbsp;MB)}}, pp. 56\u201357 (PDF pp. 59\u201360 of 63)</ref> There were no markings or signs to identify the runway exits and they were in conditions of poor visibility. The Pan Am crew appeared to remain unsure of their position on the runway until the collision, which occurred near the intersection with the fourth taxiway (C-4).<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.project-tenerife.com/engels/PDF/los_rodeos_anexo6.pdf |title=Official report, annex 6 }}</ref>\n\nThe angle of the third taxiway would have required the plane to perform a 148-degree turn, which would lead back toward the still-crowded main [[Airport apron|apron]]. At the end of C-3, the Pan Am would have to make another 148-degree turn, in order to continue taxiing towards the start of the runway, similar to a mirrored letter \"Z\". Taxiway C-4 would have required two 35-degree-turns. A study carried out by the [[Air Line Pilots Association, International|Air Line Pilots Association]] (ALPA) after the accident concluded that making the second 148-degree turn at the end of taxiway C-3 would have been \"a practical impossibility.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.project-tenerife.com/engels/PDF/alpa.pdf |title=ALPA report on the crash |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715122130/http://www.project-tenerife.com/engels/PDF/alpa.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(2.70&nbsp;MB)}}, p. 19 (PDF p. 23 of 97)</ref> The official report from the Spanish authorities explains that the controller instructed the Pan Am aircraft to use the third taxiway because this was the earliest exit that they could take to reach the unobstructed section of the parallel taxiway.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.project-tenerife.com/engels/PDF/Tenerife.pdf |title=Official report }}&nbsp;{{small|(5.98&nbsp;MB)}}, p. 46 (PDF p. 49 of 63)</ref>\n\n=== Weather conditions at Los Rodeos ===\nLos Rodeos airport is at {{convert|633|m|sp=us}} above [[sea level]], which gives rise to cloud behavior that differs from that at many other airports.

When it became clear that the KLM aircraft was approaching at takeoff speed, captain Grubbs exclaimed, \"Goddamn, that son-of-a-bitch is coming!\", while first officer Robert Bragg yelled, \"Get off! Get off! Get off!\" Captain Grubbs applied full power to the throttles and made a sharp left turn towards the grass in an attempt to avoid the impending collision.<ref name=ASN/> By the time the KLM pilots saw the Pan Am aircraft, they were already traveling too fast to stop. In desperation, the pilots prematurely [[Rotation (aeronautics)|rotated]] the aircraft and attempted to clear the Pan Am by lifting off, causing a severe [[tailstrike]] for {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe KLM 747 was within {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} of the Pan Am and moving at approximately {{convert|140|knot|km/h mph}} when it left the ground. Its nose landing gear cleared the Pan Am, but its left-side engines, lower fuselage, and main landing gear struck the upper right side of the Pan Am's fuselage,<ref name=\"Air Disaster Volume 1\"/> ripping apart the center of the Pan Am jet almost directly above the wing. The right-side engines crashed through the Pan Am's upper deck immediately behind the cockpit.\n\nThe KLM plane remained briefly airborne, but the impact had sheared off the outer left engine, caused significant amounts of shredded materials to be ingested by the inner left engine, and damaged the wings. The plane immediately went into a stall, rolled sharply, and hit the ground approximately {{convert|150|m|-2|abbr=on}} past the collision, sliding down the runway for a further {{convert|300|m|-2|abbr=on}}. The full load of fuel, which had caused the earlier delay, ignited immediately into a fireball that could not be subdued for several hours.\n\nOne of the 61 survivors of the Pan Am flight, John Coombs of [[Haleiwa]], Hawaii, said that sitting in the nose of the plane probably saved his life: \"We all settled back, and the next thing an explosion took place and the whole port side, left side of the plane, was just torn wide open.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Sadat-Visits-Israel/12361881614363-1/#title |title=Tenerife Disaster, 1977 Year in Review. |publisher=Upi.com |date=April 30, 2012 |access-date=May 5, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420191915/http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Sadat-Visits-Israel/12361881614363-1 |archive-date=April 20, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nBoth airplanes were destroyed in the collision.

The other 61 passengers and crew aboard the Pan Am aircraft survived, including the captain, first officer, and flight engineer. Most of the survivors on the Pan Am walked out onto the intact left wing, the side away from the collision, through holes in the fuselage structure. The Pan Am's engines were still running for a few minutes after the accident despite first officer Bragg's intention to turn them off. The top part of the cockpit, where the engine switches were located, had been destroyed in the collision, and all control lines were severed, leaving no method for the flight crew to control the aircraft's systems. Survivors waited for rescue, but it did not come promptly, as the firefighters were initially unaware that there were two aircraft involved and were concentrating on the KLM wreck hundreds of meters away in the thick fog and smoke.

Analysis of the CVR transcript showed that the KLM pilot thought that he had been cleared for takeoff, while the Tenerife control tower believed that the KLM 747 was stationary at the end of the runway, awaiting takeoff clearance. It appears that KLM's co-pilot was not as certain about take-off clearance as the captain.\n\n=== Probable cause ===\nThe investigation concluded that the fundamental cause of the accident was that captain Veldhuyzen van Zanten attempted to take off without clearance. The investigators suggested the reason for this was a desire to leave as soon as possible in order to comply with KLM's duty-time regulations (which went in place earlier that year) and before the weather deteriorated further.\n\nOther major factors contributing to the accident were:\n* The sudden fog greatly limited visibility. The control tower and the crews of both planes were unable to see one another.\n* Interference from simultaneous radio transmissions, with the result that it was difficult to hear the message.\n\nThe following factors were considered contributing but not critical:\n* Use of ambiguous non-standard phrases by the KLM co-pilot (\"We're at take off\") and the Tenerife control tower (\"OK\").\n* The Pan Am aircraft had not left the runway at the third intersection.\n* The airport was forced to accommodate a great number of large aircraft due to rerouting from the terrorist incident, resulting in disruption of the normal use of taxiways.<ref name=official_report>{{cite web|url= http://www.project-tenerife.com/engels/PDF/Tenerife.pdf |title=Official report }}&nbsp;{{small|(5.98&nbsp;MB)}}, pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\n=== Dutch response ===\nThe Dutch authorities were reluctant to accept the Spanish report blaming the KLM captain for the accident.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Curran |first=William J. |date=November 3, 1977 |title=The Medicolegal Lessons of the Tenerife Disaster |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=297 |issue=18 |pages=986\u2013987 |doi=10.1056/NEJM197711032971806 |pmid=909545 |issn=0028-4793 }}</ref> The Netherlands Department of Civil Aviation published a response that, while accepting that the KLM captain had taken off \"prematurely\", argued that he alone should not be blamed for the \"mutual misunderstanding\" that occurred between the controller and the KLM crew, and that limitations of using radio as a means of communication should have been given greater consideration.\n\nIn particular, the Dutch response pointed out that:\n* The crowded airport had placed additional pressure on all parties, including the KLM cockpit crew, the Pan Am cockpit crew, and the controller;\n* Sounds on the CVR suggested that during the accident the Spanish control tower crew had been listening to a [[Association football|soccer]] match on the radio and may have been distracted;<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.project-tenerife.com/nederlands/PDF/finaldutchreport.pdf| title=Final report and comments of the Netherlands Aviation Safety Board| publisher=Project-Tenerife| pages=60\u201361 (PDF pp. 40\u201341)}}</ref>\n* The transmission from the tower in which the controller passed KLM their ATC clearance was ambiguous and could have been interpreted as also giving take-off clearance.

Although the flight engineer had indeed asked the captain whether or not the Pan Am was clear of the runway, he seemed reassured by the captain's answer. The co-pilots had clearly challenged the captain's decisions, but were not insistent enough to convince him to abort the attempted takeoff.<!--But does he offer an alternative explanation?--><ref name=book>{{Cite book\n  | last = Bartelski\n  | first = Jan\n  | authorlink = \n  | title = Disasters in the air: mysterious air disasters explained\n  | publisher = Airlife\n  | year = 2001\n  | location = \n  | pages = \n  | url = https://archive.org/details/disastersinairmy0000bart\n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = 978-1-84037-204-5\n  | quote = <!-- As far as the allegations that co-pilots would not have the nerve to stand up to van Zanten during flight because of his senior position in the company, and that their career could be ruined by his adverse report, this was another example of completely false presumptions. Van Zanten was a serious and introverted individual but with an open-hearted and friendly disposition. He was a studious type and was regarded as the company\u2019s pilot expert on the Boeing 747 systems. Nevertheless, he would have been the last person on the flight desk not to accept his co-pilot\u2019s advice or warning. He believed in partnership, to the extent that he insisted on his first officers addressing him during flight as ''Jaap'' and not ''Captain van Zanten'' He had learnt much about cockpit management by representing KLM at an [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] Conference in [[Istanbul]] and was trying to put this into practice<br />...<br />Meurs was not the type to have been easily intimidated by a superior rank and would not have easily given in under stress. Although new to the 747 (he had only ninety hours on that type), he was formerly a temporary DC-8 captain. For personal reasons, he waived his seniority right for a DC-9 command and opted to fly the 747 as a first officer. Meurs was an extrovert and liked to enjoy life, a contrasting disposition to van Zanten. Both complemented each other in personalities as well as in their operational background. What van Zanten lacked in route experience, particularly in the Canary Islands area, Meurs compensated for by his ultimate knowledge of the local situation from his many past flights through Las Palmas. The reverse applied to the handling of the 747. As for his profiency as a co-pilot, I found Meurs cooperative, alert, and far from a meek and mild type. In fact, the opposite was more likely. He could be somewhat abrupt and direct in his manner, as was evident from the way he stopped van Zanten from opening the throttles -->\n  | url-access = registration\n  }}</ref>\n* The flight engineer was the only member of the KLM's flight crew to react to the control tower's instruction to \"report when runway clear\"; this might have been due to him having completed his pre-flight checks, whereas his colleagues were experiencing an increased workload, just as the visibility worsened.<ref name=\"alpa22\">{{cite web|url=http://www.project-tenerife.com/engels/PDF/alpa.pdf |title=ALPA report on the crash |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715122130/http://www.project-tenerife.com/engels/PDF/alpa.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(2.70&nbsp;MB)}}, p. 22 (PDF p. 26 of 97). \"Both pilots were contending with heavy demands on their attention as the visibility rapidly worsened.

Aviation authorities around the world introduced requirements for [[Radiotelephony procedure|standard phrases]] and a greater emphasis on English as a common [[working language]].<ref name=TIC />\n\nAir traffic instruction must not be acknowledged solely with a colloquial phrase such as \"OK\" or even \"[[Voice procedure|Roger]]\" (which simply means the last transmission was received),<ref>CAP 413 Radio Telephony Manual (Edition 15), chapter 2 page 6</ref> but with a readback of the key parts of the instruction, to show mutual understanding. The word \"takeoff\" is now spoken only when the actual takeoff clearance is given, or when cancelling that same clearance (i.e. \"cleared for takeoff\" or \"cancel takeoff clearance\"). Up until that point, aircrew and controllers should use the word \"departure\" in its place (e.g. \"ready for departure\"). Additionally, an ATC clearance given to an aircraft already lined-up on the runway must be prefixed with the instruction \"hold position\".<ref>CAP 413 Radio Telephony Manual (Edition 15), chapter 4, page 6, paragraph 1.7.10</ref>\n\n[[Cockpit]] procedures were also changed after the accident. Hierarchical relations among crew members were played down, and greater emphasis was placed on team decision-making by mutual agreement. Less experienced flight crew members were encouraged to challenge their captains when they believed something to be incorrect, and captains were instructed to listen to their crew and evaluate all decisions in light of crew concerns. This course of action was later expanded into what is known today as [[crew resource management]] (CRM), training which is now mandatory for all airline pilots.<ref>{{cite news|title=TENERIFE DISASTER - 27 MARCH 1977: The Utility of the Swiss Cheese Model & other Accident Causation Frameworks|url=http://goflightmedicine.com/tenerife-disaster/|access-date=October 13, 2014|publisher=Go Flight Medicine}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Evolution of Crew Resource Management Training in Commercial Aviation|author1 = Helmreich, R.

Schreuder had 17,031 flight hours, of which 543 hours were on the 747.\n\nThe aircraft was a Boeing 747-206B, registration PH-BUF, named ''Rijn ([[Rhine]])''. The KLM jet was carrying 14 crew members and 235 passengers, including 52 children. Most of the KLM passengers were Dutch; also on board were 4 Germans, 2 Austrians and 2 Americans. After the aircraft landed at Tenerife, the passengers were transported to the airport terminal. One of the inbound passengers, who lived on the island with her boyfriend, chose not to re-board the 747, leaving 234 passengers on board.<ref name=\"Air Disaster Volume 1\"/><ref name=\"NOVA\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3315_planecra.html|title=The Deadliest Plane Crash|date= October 17, 2006|access-date=September 23, 2014 |publisher=PBS}}</ref>\n\n=== Pan Am Flight 1736 ===\nPan Am Flight 1736 had originated at [[Los Angeles International Airport]], with an intermediate stop at New York's [[John F.

Initially, the crew was unclear as to whether the controller had told them to take the first or third exit.

Its nose landing gear cleared the Pan Am, but its left-side engines, lower fuselage, and main landing gear struck the upper right side of the Pan Am's fuselage,<ref name=\"Air Disaster Volume 1\"/> ripping apart the center of the Pan Am jet almost directly above the wing. The right-side engines crashed through the Pan Am's upper deck immediately behind the cockpit.\n\nThe KLM plane remained briefly airborne, but the impact had sheared off the outer left engine, caused significant amounts of shredded materials to be ingested by the inner left engine, and damaged the wings.

Most of the survivors on the Pan Am walked out onto the intact left wing, the side away from the collision, through holes in the fuselage structure. The Pan Am's engines were still running for a few minutes after the accident despite first officer Bragg's intention to turn them off. The top part of the cockpit, where the engine switches were located, had been destroyed in the collision, and all control lines were severed, leaving no method for the flight crew to control the aircraft's systems.

Analysis of the CVR transcript showed that the KLM pilot thought that he had been cleared for takeoff, while the Tenerife control tower believed that the KLM 747 was stationary at the end of the runway, awaiting takeoff clearance. It appears that KLM's co-pilot was not as certain about take-off clearance as the captain.\n\n=== Probable cause ===\nThe investigation concluded that the fundamental cause of the accident was that captain Veldhuyzen van Zanten attempted to take off without clearance. The investigators suggested the reason for this was a desire to leave as soon as possible in order to comply with KLM's duty-time regulations (which went in place earlier that year) and before the weather deteriorated further.\n\nOther major factors contributing to the accident were:\n* The sudden fog greatly limited visibility. The control tower and the crews of both planes were unable to see one another.\n* Interference from simultaneous radio transmissions, with the result that it was difficult to hear the message.\n\nThe following factors were considered contributing but not critical:\n* Use of ambiguous non-standard phrases by the KLM co-pilot (\"We're at take off\") and the Tenerife control tower (\"OK\").\n* The Pan Am aircraft had not left the runway at the third intersection.\n* The airport was forced to accommodate a great number of large aircraft due to rerouting from the terrorist incident, resulting in disruption of the normal use of taxiways.<ref name=official_report>{{cite web|url= http://www.project-tenerife.com/engels/PDF/Tenerife.pdf |title=Official report }}&nbsp;{{small|(5.98&nbsp;MB)}}, pp. 61\u201362</ref>\n\n=== Dutch response ===\nThe Dutch authorities were reluctant to accept the Spanish report blaming the KLM captain for the accident.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Curran |first=William J. |date=November 3, 1977 |title=The Medicolegal Lessons of the Tenerife Disaster |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |volume=297 |issue=18 |pages=986\u2013987 |doi=10.1056/NEJM197711032971806 |pmid=909545 |issn=0028-4793 }}</ref> The Netherlands Department of Civil Aviation published a response that, while accepting that the KLM captain had taken off \"prematurely\", argued that he alone should not be blamed for the \"mutual misunderstanding\" that occurred between the controller and the KLM crew, and that limitations of using radio as a means of communication should have been given greater consideration.\n\nIn particular, the Dutch response pointed out that:\n* The crowded airport had placed additional pressure on all parties, including the KLM cockpit crew, the Pan Am cockpit crew, and the controller;\n* Sounds on the CVR suggested that during the accident the Spanish control tower crew had been listening to a [[Association football|soccer]] match on the radio and may have been distracted;<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.project-tenerife.com/nederlands/PDF/finaldutchreport.pdf| title=Final report and comments of the Netherlands Aviation Safety Board| publisher=Project-Tenerife| pages=60\u201361 (PDF pp. 40\u201341)}}</ref>\n* The transmission from the tower in which the controller passed KLM their ATC clearance was ambiguous and could have been interpreted as also giving take-off clearance.

Van Zanten was a serious and introverted individual but with an open-hearted and friendly disposition. He was a studious type and was regarded as the company\u2019s pilot expert on the Boeing 747 systems. Nevertheless, he would have been the last person on the flight desk not to accept his co-pilot\u2019s advice or warning. He believed in partnership, to the extent that he insisted on his first officers addressing him during flight as ''Jaap'' and not ''Captain van Zanten'' He had learnt much about cockpit management by representing KLM at an [[International Air Transport Association|IATA]] Conference in [[Istanbul]] and was trying to put this into practice<br />...<br />Meurs was not the type to have been easily intimidated by a superior rank and would not have easily given in under stress. Although new to the 747 (he had only ninety hours on that type), he was formerly a temporary DC-8 captain. For personal reasons, he waived his seniority right for a DC-9 command and opted to fly the 747 as a first officer. Meurs was an extrovert and liked to enjoy life, a contrasting disposition to van Zanten. Both complemented each other in personalities as well as in their operational background. What van Zanten lacked in route experience, particularly in the Canary Islands area, Meurs compensated for by his ultimate knowledge of the local situation from his many past flights through Las Palmas. The reverse applied to the handling of the 747. As for his profiency as a co-pilot, I found Meurs cooperative, alert, and far from a meek and mild type. In fact, the opposite was more likely.

Aviation authorities around the world introduced requirements for [[Radiotelephony procedure|standard phrases]] and a greater emphasis on English as a common [[working language]].<ref name=TIC />\n\nAir traffic instruction must not be acknowledged solely with a colloquial phrase such as \"OK\" or even \"[[Voice procedure|Roger]]\" (which simply means the last transmission was received),<ref>CAP 413 Radio Telephony Manual (Edition 15), chapter 2 page 6</ref> but with a readback of the key parts of the instruction, to show mutual understanding. The word \"takeoff\" is now spoken only when the actual takeoff clearance is given, or when cancelling that same clearance (i.e. \"cleared for takeoff\" or \"cancel takeoff clearance\"). Up until that point, aircrew and controllers should use the word \"departure\" in its place (e.g. \"ready for departure\"). Additionally, an ATC clearance given to an aircraft already lined-up on the runway must be prefixed with the instruction \"hold position\".<ref>CAP 413 Radio Telephony Manual (Edition 15), chapter 4, page 6, paragraph 1.7.10</ref>\n\n[[Cockpit]] procedures were also changed after the accident. Hierarchical relations among crew members were played down, and greater emphasis was placed on team decision-making by mutual agreement. Less experienced flight crew members were encouraged to challenge their captains when they believed something to be incorrect, and captains were instructed to listen to their crew and evaluate all decisions in light of crew concerns. This course of action was later expanded into what is known today as [[crew resource management]] (CRM), training which is now mandatory for all airline pilots.<ref>{{cite news|title=TENERIFE DISASTER - 27 MARCH 1977: The Utility of the Swiss Cheese Model & other Accident Causation Frameworks|url=http://goflightmedicine.com/tenerife-disaster/|access-date=October 13, 2014|publisher=Go Flight Medicine}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Evolution of Crew Resource Management Training in Commercial Aviation|author1 = Helmreich, R.
