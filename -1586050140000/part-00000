His professional playing career, which lasted between 1970 and 1981, was entirely spent with the [[Houston Rockets|San Diego / Houston Rockets]]. Tomjanovich was a five-time [[NBA All-Star]] forward; four consecutive times between 1974 and 1977, and again in 1979. He also made the playoffs five times: in 1975, 1977, and consecutively between 1979 and 1981.\n\nOn December 9, 1977, during a game between the Rockets and the Los Angeles Lakers, Tomjanovich was the victim of a life-threatening punch to his face brought upon him by Lakers power forward [[Kermit Washington]]. This ended his season after 23 games; after fully recovering, Tomjanovich played in the NBA for three more seasons.\n\nAfter about eight years of being an assistant coach, Tomjanovich was promoted to head coach of the Rockets from 1992 to 2003, including when the Rockets won two consecutive [[NBA Finals|NBA championships]] in 1994 and 1995. Tomjanovich coached [[2000 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Team USA]] to the gold medal in men's basketball at the [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Olympics]]. He also coached the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] during part of the [[2004-05 Los Angeles Lakers season|2004-05 NBA season]]. He was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Hall of Fame]] on April 4, 2020.\n\n==Early life==\nTomjanovich was born in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]], to a family of Croatian descent.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/13762/mislio-sam-da-sam-poljak-dok-mi-roditelji-nisu-rekli-sa-smo-hrvati |title=Mislio sam da sam Poljak dok mi roditelji nisu rekli sa smo Hrvati |publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)]] |language=Croatian |trans-title=I thought I was Polish until my parents told me we were Croats |date=March 16, 2004 |author=Robert Bajru\u0161i |accessdate=July 4, 2012 |archivedate=July 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68u03CIWz?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/13762/mislio-sam-da-sam-poljak-dok-mi-roditelji-nisu-rekli-sa-smo-hrvati }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20072182,00.html|title=Severely Injured by a Rival Player's Punch, Rudy Tomjanovich Enjoys An Amazing Comeback|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|language=|trans-title=|date=November 13, 1978|author=Michael Wallis|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref> He attended high school in Hamtramck and later the [[University of Michigan]] (1967\u20131970).

He was also drafted in both 1970<ref>[http://www.databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1970&lg=A 1970 ABA Draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716022604/http://databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1970&lg=A |date=July 16, 2014 }}</ref> and 1974<ref>[http://www.databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1974&lg=A 1974 ABA Draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714121456/http://databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1974&lg=A |date=July 14, 2014 }}</ref> by the [[Utah Stars]] of the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]]. In his eleven years in the NBA, Tomjanovich had a scoring average of 17.4 points and a rebounding average of 8.1, earning five [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] selections in the process (1974\u20131977, 1979).  He is the third-leading scorer in Rockets history behind [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Calvin Murphy]] and [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]. Because his last name was so long, the back of Tomjanovich's jerseys would read \"RUDY T.\", rather than his 11 character name.\n\nThe Rockets retired Tomjanovich's #45 jersey upon the conclusion of his playing career.  His collegiate jersey, also #45, was retired by the University of Michigan in 2003.\n\n====Kermit Washington incident====\nDuring a game on December 9, 1977, Tomjanovich was punched by [[Kermit Washington]] of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. The blow shattered Tomjanovich's face and inflicted life-threatening head and spinal injuries, leaving him sidelined for five months. He eventually made a full recovery and was selected for the NBA All-Star Game the following [[1978\u201379 NBA season|1978\u201379 season]]. The incident and its aftermath are recounted in the [[John Feinstein]] book ''The Punch: One Night, Two Lives, and the Fight That Changed Basketball Forever'', as well as in Tomjanovich's 1997 autobiography ''A Rocket at Heart: My Life and My Team''.\n\n==Coaching career==\n\n===NBA===\n====Houston Rockets (1992-2003)====\nTomjanovich retired in 1981 and became a scout for two years before being named an assistant coach in 1983.  He served as an assistant under [[Bill Fitch]] and [[Don Chaney]].\n\nTomjanovich was named the Rockets' interim head coach in February 1992 after Chaney's resignation.  After nearly leading the Rockets to a playoff berth, he was then given the job on a permanent basis.\n\nIn his first full season on the job ([[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]]), Tomjanovich guided the Rockets to the Midwest Division title, making him the first head coach to ever take his team from the lottery to a division crown during his first full season.  Building on this success, Rudy T. led the team to back-to-back NBA championships in [[1994 NBA Finals|1994]] and [[1995 NBA Finals|1995]]; additionally, the Rockets were the only team other than the [[Chicago Bulls]] to win multiple championships during the 1990s, with their titles being bookended by the Bulls' two runs of three consecutive titles each. On the playoff run to their second title, the Rockets became the lowest seed (sixth) to win one, and the only team in history to defeat the teams with the four best regular season records in the playoffs. It was on the floor of [[The Summit (Houston)|The Summit]] after they captured their second title that Rudy proclaimed, \"Don't ever underestimate the heart of a champion!\" In his 11-plus season tenure as Rockets head coach, he posted a 503\u2013397 (.559) regular-season record and a 51\u201339 (.567) playoff mark. His career wins and winning percentage are Rockets franchise records. After the 1998-99 season, the Rockets would not make the playoffs for the rest of his coaching tenure, and would consistently finish in the division cellar; Tomjanovich left the team after the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]] when he was diagnosed with [[bladder cancer]] (from which he has since made a full recovery <ref>http://m.sfgate.com/sports/article/Rudy-T-might-quit-Lakers-2702093.php</ref>), ending a 33-year association with the Rockets franchise\u2014including its first 32 years in Houston\u2014as a player, assistant coach and head coach.\n\n====Los Angeles Lakers (2004-2005)====\nIn [[2004\u201305 Los Angeles Lakers season|2004]], Tomjanovich signed a five-year, $30 million contract to replace [[Phil Jackson]] as coach of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].<ref name=truth>{{cite news|title=NBA Truth & Rumors: May 12, 2005|date=May 13, 2005|work=SI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/scorecard/05/13/truth.rumors.nba/|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref>  He resigned after 41 games, citing mental and physical exhaustion unrelated to his past bout with bladder cancer.

Despite the absence of NBA players due to contract negotiations, Tomjanovich guided the hastily assembled group of [[Continental Basketball Association|CBA]] players to the bronze medal. In light of his outstanding service in coaching at the 1998 Worlds and his stellar professional resume, Tomjanovich was tabbed to coach the U.S. men's senior team at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Games of the XXVII Olympiad]] in Sydney, Australia. The U.S. Team won the gold medal with an 8\u20130 record. On February 15, 2006, Tomjanovich was named director of scouting for USA Men's Basketball.\n\n===Coaching style===\nTomjanovich was well known for his instinctive managerial style and intensity on the bench.  Always self-deprecating, he nonetheless heaped tremendous pressure on himself and his assistants to be prepared for each game, several times being hospitalized for exhaustion.  After winning back-to-back titles, Tomjanovich deflected much of the praise and eschewed the \"genius\" label assigned to other champion coaches like [[Chuck Daly]] and [[Phil Jackson]].  His hands-off, easy-going manner with his players gave him a reputation as a \"players coach\", and as such veteran players were eager to play on his teams.  Among the stars who requested and were granted trades to Houston during his tenure were [[Clyde Drexler]], [[Charles Barkley]], and [[Scottie Pippen]].\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 1970, Tomjanovich married Sophie Migas, a former cheerleader. They have two daughters and one son.<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite web|last1=Crowe|first1=Jerry|title=Tomjanovich loves the game and the long view|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/27/sports/sp-crowe27|website=latimes.com|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 25, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927094009/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/27/sports/sp-crowe27|archivedate=September 27, 2015|language=English|date=May 27, 2008|quote=}}</ref> He currently resides in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\nTomjanovich has participated with the [[Texas Children's Cancer Center]] to help raise funds for cancer research.

His professional playing career, which lasted between 1970 and 1981, was entirely spent with the [[Houston Rockets|San Diego / Houston Rockets]]. Tomjanovich was a five-time [[NBA All-Star]] forward; four consecutive times between 1974 and 1977, and again in 1979. He also made the playoffs five times: in 1975, 1977, and consecutively between 1979 and 1981.\n\nOn December 9, 1977, during a game between the Rockets and the Los Angeles Lakers, Tomjanovich was the victim of a life-threatening punch to his face brought upon him by Lakers power forward [[Kermit Washington]]. This ended his season after 23 games; after fully recovering, Tomjanovich played in the NBA for three more seasons.\n\nAfter about eight years of being an assistant coach, Tomjanovich was promoted to head coach of the Rockets from 1992 to 2003, including when the Rockets won two consecutive [[NBA Finals|NBA championships]] in 1994 and 1995. Tomjanovich coached [[2000 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Team USA]] to the gold medal in men's basketball at the [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Olympics]]. He also coached the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] during part of the [[2004-05 Los Angeles Lakers season|2004-05 NBA season]]. He was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Hall of Fame]] on April 4, 2020.\n\n==Early life==\nTomjanovich was born in [[Hamtramck, Michigan]], to a family of Croatian descent.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/13762/mislio-sam-da-sam-poljak-dok-mi-roditelji-nisu-rekli-sa-smo-hrvati |title=Mislio sam da sam Poljak dok mi roditelji nisu rekli sa smo Hrvati |publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)]] |language=Croatian |trans-title=I thought I was Polish until my parents told me we were Croats |date=March 16, 2004 |author=Robert Bajru\u0161i |accessdate=July 4, 2012 |archivedate=July 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68u03CIWz?url=http://www.nacional.hr/clanak/13762/mislio-sam-da-sam-poljak-dok-mi-roditelji-nisu-rekli-sa-smo-hrvati }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20072182,00.html|title=Severely Injured by a Rival Player's Punch, Rudy Tomjanovich Enjoys An Amazing Comeback|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|language=|trans-title=|date=November 13, 1978|author=Michael Wallis|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}</ref> He attended high school in Hamtramck and later the [[University of Michigan]] (1967\u20131970).

He was also drafted in both 1970<ref>[http://www.databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1970&lg=A 1970 ABA Draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140716022604/http://databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1970&lg=A |date=July 16, 2014 }}</ref> and 1974<ref>[http://www.databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1974&lg=A 1974 ABA Draft] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714121456/http://databasebasketball.com/draft/draftyear.htm?yr=1974&lg=A |date=July 14, 2014 }}</ref> by the [[Utah Stars]] of the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]]. In his eleven years in the NBA, Tomjanovich had a scoring average of 17.4 points and a rebounding average of 8.1, earning five [[NBA All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] selections in the process (1974\u20131977, 1979).  He is the third-leading scorer in Rockets history behind [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] [[Calvin Murphy]] and [[Hakeem Olajuwon]]. Because his last name was so long, the back of Tomjanovich's jerseys would read \"RUDY T.\", rather than his 11 character name.\n\nThe Rockets retired Tomjanovich's #45 jersey upon the conclusion of his playing career.  His collegiate jersey, also #45, was retired by the University of Michigan in 2003.\n\n====Kermit Washington incident====\nDuring a game on December 9, 1977, Tomjanovich was punched by [[Kermit Washington]] of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. The blow shattered Tomjanovich's face and inflicted life-threatening head and spinal injuries, leaving him sidelined for five months. He eventually made a full recovery and was selected for the NBA All-Star Game the following [[1978\u201379 NBA season|1978\u201379 season]]. The incident and its aftermath are recounted in the [[John Feinstein]] book ''The Punch: One Night, Two Lives, and the Fight That Changed Basketball Forever'', as well as in Tomjanovich's 1997 autobiography ''A Rocket at Heart: My Life and My Team''.\n\n==Coaching career==\n\n===NBA===\n====Houston Rockets (1992-2003)====\nTomjanovich retired in 1981 and became a scout for two years before being named an assistant coach in 1983.  He served as an assistant under [[Bill Fitch]] and [[Don Chaney]].\n\nTomjanovich was named the Rockets' interim head coach in February 1992 after Chaney's resignation.  After nearly leading the Rockets to a playoff berth, he was then given the job on a permanent basis.\n\nIn his first full season on the job ([[1992\u201393 NBA season|1992\u201393]]), Tomjanovich guided the Rockets to the Midwest Division title, making him the first head coach to ever take his team from the lottery to a division crown during his first full season.  Building on this success, Rudy T. led the team to back-to-back NBA championships in [[1994 NBA Finals|1994]] and [[1995 NBA Finals|1995]]; additionally, the Rockets were the only team other than the [[Chicago Bulls]] to win multiple championships during the 1990s, with their titles being bookended by the Bulls' two runs of three consecutive titles each. On the playoff run to their second title, the Rockets became the lowest seed (sixth) to win one, and the only team in history to defeat the teams with the four best regular season records in the playoffs. It was on the floor of [[The Summit (Houston)|The Summit]] after they captured their second title that Rudy proclaimed, \"Don't ever underestimate the heart of a champion!\" In his 11-plus season tenure as Rockets head coach, he posted a 503\u2013397 (.559) regular-season record and a 51\u201339 (.567) playoff mark. His career wins and winning percentage are Rockets franchise records. After the 1998-99 season, the Rockets would not make the playoffs for the rest of his coaching tenure, and would consistently finish in the division cellar; Tomjanovich left the team after the [[2002\u201303 NBA season|2002\u201303 season]] when he was diagnosed with [[bladder cancer]] (from which he has since made a full recovery <ref>http://m.sfgate.com/sports/article/Rudy-T-might-quit-Lakers-2702093.php</ref>), ending a 33-year association with the Rockets franchise\u2014including its first 32 years in Houston\u2014as a player, assistant coach and head coach.\n\n====Los Angeles Lakers (2004-2005)====\nIn [[2004\u201305 Los Angeles Lakers season|2004]], Tomjanovich signed a five-year, $30 million contract to replace [[Phil Jackson]] as coach of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].<ref name=truth>{{cite news|title=NBA Truth & Rumors: May 12, 2005|date=May 13, 2005|work=SI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/scorecard/05/13/truth.rumors.nba/|accessdate=February 20, 2013}}</ref>  He resigned after 41 games, citing mental and physical exhaustion unrelated to his past bout with bladder cancer.

Despite the absence of NBA players due to contract negotiations, Tomjanovich guided the hastily assembled group of [[Continental Basketball Association|CBA]] players to the bronze medal. In light of his outstanding service in coaching at the 1998 Worlds and his stellar professional resume, Tomjanovich was tabbed to coach the U.S. men's senior team at the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Games of the XXVII Olympiad]] in Sydney, Australia. The U.S. Team won the gold medal with an 8\u20130 record. On February 15, 2006, Tomjanovich was named director of scouting for USA Men's Basketball.\n\n===Coaching style===\nTomjanovich was well known for his instinctive managerial style and intensity on the bench.  Always self-deprecating, he nonetheless heaped tremendous pressure on himself and his assistants to be prepared for each game, several times being hospitalized for exhaustion.  After winning back-to-back titles, Tomjanovich deflected much of the praise and eschewed the \"genius\" label assigned to other champion coaches like [[Chuck Daly]] and [[Phil Jackson]].  His hands-off, easy-going manner with his players gave him a reputation as a \"players coach\", and as such veteran players were eager to play on his teams.  Among the stars who requested and were granted trades to Houston during his tenure were [[Clyde Drexler]], [[Charles Barkley]], and [[Scottie Pippen]].\n\n==Personal life==\n\nIn 1970, Tomjanovich married Sophie Migas, a former cheerleader. They have two daughters and one son.<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite web|last1=Crowe|first1=Jerry|title=Tomjanovich loves the game and the long view|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/27/sports/sp-crowe27|website=latimes.com|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=March 25, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927094009/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/27/sports/sp-crowe27|archivedate=September 27, 2015|language=English|date=May 27, 2008|quote=}}</ref> He currently resides in [[Austin, Texas]].\n\nTomjanovich has participated with the [[Texas Children's Cancer Center]] to help raise funds for cancer research.

He is ridiculed for his big ears, but in fact he is capable of [[flight|flying]] by using his ears as [[wing]]s. Throughout most of the film, his only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy \u2013 a relationship parodying the [[Fear of mice#Elephants and mice|stereotypical animosity between mice and elephants]].\n\n''Dumbo'' was released on October 23, 1941; made to recoup the financial losses of ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', it was a deliberate pursuit of simplicity and economy for the Disney studio. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. Sound was recorded conventionally using the [[RCA Photophone|RCA]] System. One voice was synthesized using the [[Sonovox]] system, but it, too, was recorded using the RCA System.\n\nIn 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|publisher=|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA [[Dumbo (2019 film)|live-action adaptation]] of the film directed by [[Tim Burton]] was released on March 29, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot length should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nUpon the passing of winter, in 1941, a flock of [[White Stork#Storks and childbirth|storks]] deliver babies to [[circus]] animals within the \"Winter Quarters\" in [[Florida]]. All the mothers receive their parcels before departure except the [[elephant]] Mrs. Jumbo. During travel, a lost stork brings her an elephant who, to the other elephants' surprise, is adorned with extraordinarily large ears. He is made an object of ridicule and given the nickname \"Dumbo\". Mrs. Jumbo attempts to remain dignified and treats her child with all her maternal love, but when a group of rascals takes to [[Mockery|mock]]ing Dumbo, Mrs. Jumbo catches one of them with her trunk and [[Spanking|spanks]] him. The circus [[Ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] deems Mrs. Jumbo [[insanity|mad]] and has her locked in a cage. The lone Dumbo is made a pariah amongst the rest of the circus troupe. A small [[mouse]] named Timothy consoles Dumbo and vows to make him a star.\n\nAfter being secretly encouraged by Timothy, the ringmaster makes Dumbo the top of an elephant pyramid stunt. The performance goes awry as Dumbo trips over his ears and misses his target, causing the other elephants to suffer various injuries, and bring down the big top. Dumbo is made into a [[Circus clown|clown]] as a result, to the shame of the other elephants, and plays the main role in an act that involves him falling into a [[wikt:vat|vat]] of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity and fame, Dumbo dislikes this job, and is now more miserable than ever. To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy takes him to visit his imprisoned mother. The two are unable to see each other face to face, and can only entwine trunks. On the way back, Dumbo cries and then starts to hiccup, so Timothy takes him for a drink of water from a bucket that, unknown to them, has accidentally had a bottle of [[champagne]] spilled into it by the clowns. As a result, Dumbo and Timothy both become [[drunk]] and have surreal [[hallucination]]s of [[Seeing pink elephants|pink elephants]].\n\nThe next morning, Dumbo and Timothy are awakened by a group of [[crows]] who are surprised to find an elephant sitting on the highest branches of a tree. As the initial astonishment passes, Timothy surmises that Dumbo had managed to achieve flight using his large ears as wings. Timothy persuades an insecure Dumbo to use this gift with the support of the crows' leader, who gives Dumbo one of his feathers and convinces him that it carries magic properties that will allow him to fly. Back at the circus, Timothy proposes to Dumbo to transform his clown act into a flying performance. As Dumbo unfolds his ears during the plummet, he loses the feather and panics. Timothy quickly confesses that the feather was never magical, and that he is still able to fly. Dumbo is able to pull out of the dive and flies around the circus, finally striking back at his tormentors as a stunned audience looks on in amazement. After this performance, Dumbo becomes a media sensation, Timothy becomes his manager and the new owner of the circus, Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo are given a private car on the [[circus train]], and while the sentient train Casey Jr. travels to the next destination, Mrs. Jumbo, Dumbo and the crows greet each other in the distance, with the little elephant's new friends wishing him good luck.\n\n==Voice cast==\nThe voice actors are uncredited for their roles in the film.\n* The [[title role|title character]] is Dumbo, the nickname given to Jumbo Jr. He is an elephant who has huge ears and is able to use them to fly, carrying what he thinks of as a magic feather. Like Dopey in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', Gideon in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', and Tootles in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'', Dumbo does not have a word of [[dialogue|spoken dialogue]].\n* [[Edward Brophy]] as Timothy Q. Mouse, an [[anthropomorphic]] mouse who becomes the only friend of Dumbo, along with the crows, after his mother is locked up and does his best to make Dumbo happy again. He teaches Dumbo how to become the \"ninth wonder of the universe\", and the only flying elephant in the world. He is never mentioned by name in the film, but his signature can be read on the contract in a newspaper photograph at the finale.\n* [[Verna Felton]] as Elephant Matriarch, the well-meaning but pompous leader of the elephants who is initially cold toward Dumbo. Felton also voices Mrs. Jumbo, Dumbo's mother, who speaks only once in the film to give Dumbo's name.\n* [[Cliff Edwards]] as Dandy Crow (previously named [[Jim Crow]] on the original model sheets), the leader of a group of crows. Though he initially jokes and ridicules Timothy's idea that Dumbo can fly, he hears Dumbo's tragic history and becomes determined to help Dumbo fly for real. He is never mentioned by name in the film, and so the other crows.\n* [[Herman Bing]] as The Ringmaster, who, though not truly evil, is a strict, greedy, and arrogant man who exploits workers and animals. The Ringmaster later appears as an outright villain in the video game ''[[Disney's Villains' Revenge]]''.\n* Margaret Wright as Casey Junior, the sentient [[2-4-0]] [[tender (rail)|tender locomotive]] hauling the circus train.\n* [[Sterling Holloway]] as Mr. Stork\n* The Hall Johnson Choir as Crow Chorus\n*[[James Baskett]] as Fats Crow\n* [[Nick Stewart]] as Specks Crow\n* [[Hall Johnson]] as Deacon Crow\n* Jim Carmichael as Dopey Crow\n* The King's Men as Roustabout Chorus\n* Noreen Gammill as Elephant Catty\n* Dorothy Scott as Elephant Giddy\n* Sarah Selby as Elephant Prissy\n* Malcolm Hutton as Skinny\n* [[Billy Bletcher]] as Clown\n* John McLeish as the narrator\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Dumbo'' is based upon a children's story written by [[Helen Aberson-Mayer]] and Harold Pearl,<ref name=\"pace\"/> with illustrations by Helen Durney.<ref name=\"hrdpapers\">{{cite web|url=https://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/d/durney_hr.htm|title=Helen R.

From January 22 to March 21, 1940, they wrote a 102-page script outline in chapters, much like a book, an unusual way of writing a film script. They conceived the stork-delivery and the pink elephants sequences and had Dumbo's mother renamed from \"Mother Ella\" to \"Mrs. Jumbo\". They riffed on elephants' fear of mice by replacing a wise [[American robin|robin]] named \"Red\" found in the original story with the wisecracking mouse character, Timothy. They also added a \"rusty black crow\", which was later expanded into five.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Canemaker|title=Two Guys Named Joe|page=149|publisher=Disney Editions|year=2010|isbn=978-1423110675}}</ref> Regardless of this, very little was changed from the original draft.<ref name=\"TakingFlight\">{{cite DVD notes|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oCdaIMOF_k|title=Taking Flight: The Making of Dumbo|type=Bonus feature|publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|year=2011|via=YouTube}}</ref> In March 1940, a story team headed by Otto Englander translated the outline into story sketches.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=273}}\n\n===Casting===\nNone of the voice actors for ''Dumbo'' received screen credit, much like in ''Snow White'' and ''Pinocchio''. Timothy Mouse was voiced by [[Edward Brophy]], a [[character actor]] known for portraying [[gangsters]]. He has no other known animation voice credit. The semi-antagonistic circus director was voiced by [[Herman Bing]], a [[German American]] character actor remembered for his wild-eyed facial expressions and thick German accent in several comedy works. The pompous matriarch of the elephants was voiced by [[Verna Felton]], who also voiced the [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Fairy Godmother|Fairy Godmother]] in ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', the Queen of Hearts in ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', Aunt Sarah in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', Flora of the Three Good Fairies in ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', and Winifred the Elephant in ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''. Other voice actors include the perennial [[Sterling Holloway]] in appearing as Mr. Stork, who also voiced [[Winnie the Pooh (Disney character)|Winnie the Pooh]], Kaa in ''The Jungle Book'', the Cheshire Cat in ''Alice in Wonderland'', and Roquefort in ''[[The Aristocats]]''. [[Cliff Edwards]], better known as the voice of [[Jiminy Cricket]], as Dandy (Jim) Crow, the leader of the [[crow]]s, and John McLeish, best known for narrating the [[Goofy]] \"''How To''\" cartoons, providing the opening narration. The other crows were voiced by [[James Baskett]], who portrayed [[Uncle Remus]] and voiced [[Br'er Fox]] and [[Br'er Rabbit]] in ''[[Song of the South]]'' in 1946, [[Nick Stewart]], who voiced [[Br'er Bear]] in the same film, the composer and arranger [[Hall Johnson]] and the singer Jim Carmichael.\n\n===Animation===\nFrom Disney's perspective, ''Dumbo'' required none of the special effects that had slowed down production and grew the budgets of ''Pinocchio'', ''Fantasia'', and ''Bambi''.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=272}} When the film went into production in early 1941, supervising director [[Ben Sharpsteen]] was given orders to keep the film simple and inexpensive.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=333}} As a result, the character designs are simpler, background paintings are less detailed, and a number of held cels (or frames) were used in the [[traditional animation|character animation]]. Although the film is more \"cartoony\" than previous Disney films, the animators brought elephants and other animals into the studio to study their movement.<ref name=\"John Canemaker\" />\n\n[[Watercolor painting|Watercolor paint]] was used to render the backgrounds. ''Dumbo'' is one of the few Disney features to use the technique, which was also used for ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', and regularly employed for the various Disney cartoon shorts. The other Disney features used [[oil paint]] and [[gouache]]. 2002's ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'', which drew influences from ''Dumbo'', [[Lilo & Stitch#Design and animation|also made use of watercolor backgrounds]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/362/362707p1.html|title=A Look Inside the Creation of Lilo and Stitch|publisher=Movies.ign.com|date=June 19, 2002|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Disney animators' strike====\n{{main|Disney animators' strike}}\nDuring a story meeting for ''Bambi'' on February 27, 1940, Disney observed that ''Dumbo'' was \"an obvious straight cartoon\" and that the animators that were assigned on ''Bambi'' were not appropriate for the look of ''Dumbo''. Animators such as [[Art Babbitt]] and [[Ward Kimball]] were considered for the film.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=272}} For that reason, less experienced animators were brought on to animate the characters. Kimball recalled that Disney approached him in a parking lot about ''Dumbo'' and summarized the entire story in five minutes. \"And listening to him tell that story,\" Kimball noted, \"I could tell that the picture was going to work. Because everything sounded right. It had a great plot.\" In spite of this, [[Bill Tytla]], who was one of the studio's top animators, animated the title character, but admitted that \"it was in the nature of the film to go very fast and get it out in a hurry.\" To speed up production, Disney used photostats of story sketches instead of full layout artwork for the film, and had experienced animators to supervise the younger, less experienced animators assigned on the film.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=333\u20134}}\n\nProduction on the film was interrupted on May 29, 1941 when much of the Disney animation staff went on strike. Kimball chose to not to strike, but his close friend [[Walt Kelly]], who was an assistant animator helping him on the crow sequence, left the studios shortly after for reasons unrelated to the strike.<ref>{{cite book|last=Canemaker|first=John|title=Walt Disney's Nine Old Men and the Art of Animation|chapter=Ward Kimball|pp=104\u20135|year=2001|publisher=Disney Editions|isbn=978-0786864966}}</ref>\n\n===Songs and performers===\n* \"Look Out for Mr. Stork\" (The Sportsmen)\n* \"Casey Junior\" (The Sportsmen)\n* \"Song of the Roustabouts\" (The King's Men)\n* \"[[Baby Mine (Dumbo song)|Baby Mine]]\" ([[Betty Noyes]])\n* \"The Clown Song\" (A.K.A.\"We're gonna hit the big boss for a raise\") (Billy Bletcher, Eddie Holden and Billy Sheets)\n* \"[[Pink Elephants on Parade]]\" (The Sportsmen) (preceded by two minutes of music on soundtrack version)\n* \"When I See an Elephant Fly\" (Cliff Edwards and the Hall Johnson Choir)\n* \"When I See an Elephant Fly\" (Reprise)\n\nOn ''[[Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic]]'', \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" is included on the [[Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic#Disc three|green disc]], \"Baby Mine\" is on the [[Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic#Disc four|purple disc]], and \"When I See an Elephant Fly\" is on the [[Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic#Disc five|orange disc]].

He is ridiculed for his big ears, but in fact he is capable of [[flight|flying]] by using his ears as [[wing]]s. Throughout most of the film, his only true friend, aside from his mother, is the mouse, Timothy \u2013 a relationship parodying the [[Fear of mice#Elephants and mice|stereotypical animosity between mice and elephants]].\n\n''Dumbo'' was released on October 23, 1941; made to recoup the financial losses of ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', it was a deliberate pursuit of simplicity and economy for the Disney studio. At 64 minutes, it is one of Disney's shortest animated features. Sound was recorded conventionally using the [[RCA Photophone|RCA]] System. One voice was synthesized using the [[Sonovox]] system, but it, too, was recorded using the RCA System.\n\nIn 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|publisher=|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nA [[Dumbo (2019 film)|live-action adaptation]] of the film directed by [[Tim Burton]] was released on March 29, 2019.\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot length should be between 400 and 700 words. -->\nUpon the passing of winter, in 1941, a flock of [[White Stork#Storks and childbirth|storks]] deliver babies to [[circus]] animals within the \"Winter Quarters\" in [[Florida]]. All the mothers receive their parcels before departure except the [[elephant]] Mrs. Jumbo. During travel, a lost stork brings her an elephant who, to the other elephants' surprise, is adorned with extraordinarily large ears. He is made an object of ridicule and given the nickname \"Dumbo\". Mrs. Jumbo attempts to remain dignified and treats her child with all her maternal love, but when a group of rascals takes to [[Mockery|mock]]ing Dumbo, Mrs. Jumbo catches one of them with her trunk and [[Spanking|spanks]] him. The circus [[Ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] deems Mrs. Jumbo [[insanity|mad]] and has her locked in a cage. The lone Dumbo is made a pariah amongst the rest of the circus troupe. A small [[mouse]] named Timothy consoles Dumbo and vows to make him a star.\n\nAfter being secretly encouraged by Timothy, the ringmaster makes Dumbo the top of an elephant pyramid stunt. The performance goes awry as Dumbo trips over his ears and misses his target, causing the other elephants to suffer various injuries, and bring down the big top. Dumbo is made into a [[Circus clown|clown]] as a result, to the shame of the other elephants, and plays the main role in an act that involves him falling into a [[wikt:vat|vat]] of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity and fame, Dumbo dislikes this job, and is now more miserable than ever. To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy takes him to visit his imprisoned mother. The two are unable to see each other face to face, and can only entwine trunks. On the way back, Dumbo cries and then starts to hiccup, so Timothy takes him for a drink of water from a bucket that, unknown to them, has accidentally had a bottle of [[champagne]] spilled into it by the clowns. As a result, Dumbo and Timothy both become [[drunk]] and have surreal [[hallucination]]s of [[Seeing pink elephants|pink elephants]].\n\nThe next morning, Dumbo and Timothy are awakened by a group of [[crows]] who are surprised to find an elephant sitting on the highest branches of a tree. As the initial astonishment passes, Timothy surmises that Dumbo had managed to achieve flight using his large ears as wings. Timothy persuades an insecure Dumbo to use this gift with the support of the crows' leader, who gives Dumbo one of his feathers and convinces him that it carries magic properties that will allow him to fly. Back at the circus, Timothy proposes to Dumbo to transform his clown act into a flying performance. As Dumbo unfolds his ears during the plummet, he loses the feather and panics. Timothy quickly confesses that the feather was never magical, and that he is still able to fly. Dumbo is able to pull out of the dive and flies around the circus, finally striking back at his tormentors as a stunned audience looks on in amazement. After this performance, Dumbo becomes a media sensation, Timothy becomes his manager and the new owner of the circus, Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo are given a private car on the [[circus train]], and while the sentient train Casey Jr. travels to the next destination, Mrs. Jumbo, Dumbo and the crows greet each other in the distance, with the little elephant's new friends wishing him good luck.\n\n==Voice cast==\nThe voice actors are uncredited for their roles in the film.\n* The [[title role|title character]] is Dumbo, the nickname given to Jumbo Jr. He is an elephant who has huge ears and is able to use them to fly, carrying what he thinks of as a magic feather. Like Dopey in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', Gideon in ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', and Tootles in ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'', Dumbo does not have a word of [[dialogue|spoken dialogue]].\n* [[Edward Brophy]] as Timothy Q. Mouse, an [[anthropomorphic]] mouse who becomes the only friend of Dumbo, along with the crows, after his mother is locked up and does his best to make Dumbo happy again. He teaches Dumbo how to become the \"ninth wonder of the universe\", and the only flying elephant in the world. He is never mentioned by name in the film, but his signature can be read on the contract in a newspaper photograph at the finale.\n* [[Verna Felton]] as Elephant Matriarch, the well-meaning but pompous leader of the elephants who is initially cold toward Dumbo. Felton also voices Mrs. Jumbo, Dumbo's mother, who speaks only once in the film to give Dumbo's name.\n* [[Cliff Edwards]] as Dandy Crow (previously named [[Jim Crow]] on the original model sheets), the leader of a group of crows. Though he initially jokes and ridicules Timothy's idea that Dumbo can fly, he hears Dumbo's tragic history and becomes determined to help Dumbo fly for real. He is never mentioned by name in the film, and so the other crows.\n* [[Herman Bing]] as The Ringmaster, who, though not truly evil, is a strict, greedy, and arrogant man who exploits workers and animals. The Ringmaster later appears as an outright villain in the video game ''[[Disney's Villains' Revenge]]''.\n* Margaret Wright as Casey Junior, the sentient [[2-4-0]] [[tender (rail)|tender locomotive]] hauling the circus train.\n* [[Sterling Holloway]] as Mr. Stork\n* The Hall Johnson Choir as Crow Chorus\n*[[James Baskett]] as Fats Crow\n* [[Nick Stewart]] as Specks Crow\n* [[Hall Johnson]] as Deacon Crow\n* Jim Carmichael as Dopey Crow\n* The King's Men as Roustabout Chorus\n* Noreen Gammill as Elephant Catty\n* Dorothy Scott as Elephant Giddy\n* Sarah Selby as Elephant Prissy\n* Malcolm Hutton as Skinny\n* [[Billy Bletcher]] as Clown\n* John McLeish as the narrator\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n''Dumbo'' is based upon a children's story written by [[Helen Aberson-Mayer]] and Harold Pearl,<ref name=\"pace\"/> with illustrations by Helen Durney.<ref name=\"hrdpapers\">{{cite web|url=https://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/d/durney_hr.htm|title=Helen R.

From January 22 to March 21, 1940, they wrote a 102-page script outline in chapters, much like a book, an unusual way of writing a film script. They conceived the stork-delivery and the pink elephants sequences and had Dumbo's mother renamed from \"Mother Ella\" to \"Mrs. Jumbo\". They riffed on elephants' fear of mice by replacing a wise [[American robin|robin]] named \"Red\" found in the original story with the wisecracking mouse character, Timothy. They also added a \"rusty black crow\", which was later expanded into five.<ref>{{cite book|first=John|last=Canemaker|title=Two Guys Named Joe|page=149|publisher=Disney Editions|year=2010|isbn=978-1423110675}}</ref> Regardless of this, very little was changed from the original draft.<ref name=\"TakingFlight\">{{cite DVD notes|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oCdaIMOF_k|title=Taking Flight: The Making of Dumbo|type=Bonus feature|publisher=Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment|year=2011|via=YouTube}}</ref> In March 1940, a story team headed by Otto Englander translated the outline into story sketches.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=273}}\n\n===Casting===\nNone of the voice actors for ''Dumbo'' received screen credit, much like in ''Snow White'' and ''Pinocchio''. Timothy Mouse was voiced by [[Edward Brophy]], a [[character actor]] known for portraying [[gangsters]]. He has no other known animation voice credit. The semi-antagonistic circus director was voiced by [[Herman Bing]], a [[German American]] character actor remembered for his wild-eyed facial expressions and thick German accent in several comedy works. The pompous matriarch of the elephants was voiced by [[Verna Felton]], who also voiced the [[List of Disney's Cinderella characters#Fairy Godmother|Fairy Godmother]] in ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', the Queen of Hearts in ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', Aunt Sarah in ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'', Flora of the Three Good Fairies in ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'', and Winifred the Elephant in ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''. Other voice actors include the perennial [[Sterling Holloway]] in appearing as Mr. Stork, who also voiced [[Winnie the Pooh (Disney character)|Winnie the Pooh]], Kaa in ''The Jungle Book'', the Cheshire Cat in ''Alice in Wonderland'', and Roquefort in ''[[The Aristocats]]''. [[Cliff Edwards]], better known as the voice of [[Jiminy Cricket]], as Dandy (Jim) Crow, the leader of the [[crow]]s, and John McLeish, best known for narrating the [[Goofy]] \"''How To''\" cartoons, providing the opening narration. The other crows were voiced by [[James Baskett]], who portrayed [[Uncle Remus]] and voiced [[Br'er Fox]] and [[Br'er Rabbit]] in ''[[Song of the South]]'' in 1946, [[Nick Stewart]], who voiced [[Br'er Bear]] in the same film, the composer and arranger [[Hall Johnson]] and the singer Jim Carmichael.\n\n===Animation===\nFrom Disney's perspective, ''Dumbo'' required none of the special effects that had slowed down production and grew the budgets of ''Pinocchio'', ''Fantasia'', and ''Bambi''.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=272}} When the film went into production in early 1941, supervising director [[Ben Sharpsteen]] was given orders to keep the film simple and inexpensive.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|p=333}} As a result, the character designs are simpler, background paintings are less detailed, and a number of held cels (or frames) were used in the [[traditional animation|character animation]]. Although the film is more \"cartoony\" than previous Disney films, the animators brought elephants and other animals into the studio to study their movement.<ref name=\"John Canemaker\" />\n\n[[Watercolor painting|Watercolor paint]] was used to render the backgrounds. ''Dumbo'' is one of the few Disney features to use the technique, which was also used for ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', and regularly employed for the various Disney cartoon shorts. The other Disney features used [[oil paint]] and [[gouache]]. 2002's ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'', which drew influences from ''Dumbo'', [[Lilo & Stitch#Design and animation|also made use of watercolor backgrounds]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/362/362707p1.html|title=A Look Inside the Creation of Lilo and Stitch|publisher=Movies.ign.com|date=June 19, 2002|accessdate=April 13, 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Disney animators' strike====\n{{main|Disney animators' strike}}\nDuring a story meeting for ''Bambi'' on February 27, 1940, Disney observed that ''Dumbo'' was \"an obvious straight cartoon\" and that the animators that were assigned on ''Bambi'' were not appropriate for the look of ''Dumbo''. Animators such as [[Art Babbitt]] and [[Ward Kimball]] were considered for the film.{{sfn|Barrier|1999|p=272}} For that reason, less experienced animators were brought on to animate the characters. Kimball recalled that Disney approached him in a parking lot about ''Dumbo'' and summarized the entire story in five minutes. \"And listening to him tell that story,\" Kimball noted, \"I could tell that the picture was going to work. Because everything sounded right. It had a great plot.\" In spite of this, [[Bill Tytla]], who was one of the studio's top animators, animated the title character, but admitted that \"it was in the nature of the film to go very fast and get it out in a hurry.\" To speed up production, Disney used photostats of story sketches instead of full layout artwork for the film, and had experienced animators to supervise the younger, less experienced animators assigned on the film.{{sfn|Gabler|2006|pp=333\u20134}}\n\nProduction on the film was interrupted on May 29, 1941 when much of the Disney animation staff went on strike. Kimball chose to not to strike, but his close friend [[Walt Kelly]], who was an assistant animator helping him on the crow sequence, left the studios shortly after for reasons unrelated to the strike.<ref>{{cite book|last=Canemaker|first=John|title=Walt Disney's Nine Old Men and the Art of Animation|chapter=Ward Kimball|pp=104\u20135|year=2001|publisher=Disney Editions|isbn=978-0786864966}}</ref>\n\n===Songs and performers===\n* \"Look Out for Mr. Stork\" (The Sportsmen)\n* \"Casey Junior\" (The Sportsmen)\n* \"Song of the Roustabouts\" (The King's Men)\n* \"[[Baby Mine (Dumbo song)|Baby Mine]]\" ([[Betty Noyes]])\n* \"The Clown Song\" (A.K.A.\"We're gonna hit the big boss for a raise\") (Billy Bletcher, Eddie Holden and Billy Sheets)\n* \"[[Pink Elephants on Parade]]\" (The Sportsmen) (preceded by two minutes of music on soundtrack version)\n* \"When I See an Elephant Fly\" (Cliff Edwards and the Hall Johnson Choir)\n* \"When I See an Elephant Fly\" (Reprise)\n\nOn ''[[Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic]]'', \"Pink Elephants on Parade\" is included on the [[Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic#Disc three|green disc]], \"Baby Mine\" is on the [[Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic#Disc four|purple disc]], and \"When I See an Elephant Fly\" is on the [[Classic Disney: 60 Years of Musical Magic#Disc five|orange disc]].

Many of the finds are displayed in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]. The [[Getty Villa]] is a reproduction of the Villa of the Papyri.\n\n==Layout==\n[[File:Herculaneum, past, present and future (1908) (14596218878).jpg|thumb|500px|Ground plan showing location of tunnels (in brown)]]\nThe villa is located a few hundred metres from the nearest house in [[Herculaneum]]. Although it now lies inland, before the volcanic eruption of October 79 A.D., the structure occupied more than {{convert|250|m|ft}} of coastline along the [[Gulf of Naples]]. On the other sides it was surrounded by a closed garden, vineyards and woods. The villa had four levels beneath the main floor, arranged in terraces overlooking the sea.<ref name=\"herculaneum.ox.ac.uk\">http://www.herculaneum.ox.ac.uk/?q=De%20Simone</ref> It has recently been ascertained that the main floor was {{cvt|16|m|ft}} above sea level in antiquity.\n\n[[File:Escipi\u00f3n africano.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bronze bust of [[Scipio Africanus]], mid 1st century BC, found in the Villa of the Papyri]]\nThe villa's layout is an expanded version of the traditional Campanian villa suburbana. One entered through the fauces and proceeded to the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]], which functioned as an entrance hall and a means of communication with the various parts of the house. The entrance opened with a columned portico on the sea side.\n\nAfter passing through the [[tablinum]], one arrived at the first [[peristyle]], made up of ten columns on each side, with a swimming pool in the centre. In this area were found the bronze [[Herma|herm]] adapted from the [[Doryphorus]] of [[Polykleitos]]<nowiki/> and the herm of an [[Amazons|Amazon]] made by Apollonios son of Archias of Athens.<ref name=\"apollonius\">Stewart, Andrew. ''Greek Sculpture''. Yale University Press (1990).</ref> The large second peristyle could be reached by passing through a large tablinum in which, under a [[propylaeum]], was the archaic statue of [[Athena Promachos]]. A collection of bronze busts were in the interior of the tablinum. These included the head of [[Scipio Africanus]].<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\nThe living and reception quarters were grouped around the porticoes and terraces, giving occupants ample sunlight and a view of the countryside and sea. In the living quarters, bath installations were brought to light, and the library of rolled and carbonised papyri placed inside wooden ''capsae'', some of them on ordinary wooden shelves and around the walls and some on the two sides of a set of shelves in the middle of the room.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\nThe grounds included a large area of covered and uncovered gardens for walks in the shade or in the warmth of the sun. The gardens included a gallery of busts, hermae and small marble and bronze statues. These were laid out between columns amid the open part of the garden and on the edges of the large swimming bath.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\n==Works of art==\n[[File:Resting Hermes MAN Napoli Inv5625 n02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Barker identified this sculpture as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].

The villa housed a collection of at least 80 sculptures of magnificent quality,<ref>https://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/herculaneum-1/villa-of-the-papyri/catalogue-of-sculptures</ref> many now conserved in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].<ref name=\"Amedeo\" /> Among them is the bronze ''[[Seated Hermes]]'', found at the villa in 1758. Around the bowl of the atrium [[impluvium]] were 11 bronze fountain statues depicting [[Satyrs]] pouring water from a pitcher and [[Putto|Amorini]] pouring water from the mouth of a dolphin. Other statues and busts were found in the corners around the atrium walls.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\n[[File:Danzatrici o danaidi, da villa dei papiri, peristilio quadrato.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of dancers from the peristyle.]]\nFive statues of life-sized bronze dancing women wearing the [[Dorians|Doric]] [[peplos]] sculpted in different positions and with inlaid eyes are adapted Roman copies of originals from the fifth century BC. They are also [[hydrophorai]] drawing water from a fountain.\n\n==Epicureanism and the library==\nThe owner of the house, perhaps Calpurnius Piso, established a library of a mainly philosophical character. It is believed that the library might have been collected and selected by Piso's family friend and client, the Epicurean [[Philodemus of G\u00e0dara]], although this conclusion is not certain.<ref name=\"oxford\" /><ref>See Erlend D. MacGillivray, \"The Popularity of Epicureanism in Late-Republic Roman Society\", ''The Ancient World'' XLIII (2012) 151\u2013172.</ref> Followers of [[Epicurus]] studied the teachings of this moral and natural philosopher. This philosophy taught that man is mortal, that the cosmos is the result of accident, that there is no providential god, and that the criteria of a good life are pleasure and temperance. Philodemus' connections with Piso brought him an opportunity to influence the young students of Greek literature and philosophy who gathered around him at [[Herculaneum]] and [[Naples]]. Much of his work was discovered in about a thousand [[Papyri from Herculaneum|papyrus rolls]] in the philosophical library recovered at Herculaneum. Although his prose work is detailed in the strung-out, non-periodic style typical of Hellenistic Greek prose before the revival of the Attic style after [[Cicero]], Philodemus surpassed the average literary standard to which most epicureans aspired. Philodemus succeeded in influencing the most learned and distinguished Romans of his age. None of his prose work was known until the rolls of papyri were discovered among the ruins of the Villa of the Papyri.<ref name=\"oxford\" />\n\n[[Image:Papyri.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|Papyrus recovered from Villa of the Papyri.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />]]\nAt the time of the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79, the valuable library was packed in cases ready to be moved to safety when it was overtaken by a [[pyroclastic flow]]; the eruption eventually deposited some 20\u201325&nbsp;m of volcanic ash over the site, charring the [[scroll]]s but preserving them \u2013 the only surviving library of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] \u2013 as the ash hardened to form [[tuff]].<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\n==Excavations==\n{{details|Herculaneum papyri}}\nThe [[House of Bourbon]] under [[King Charles VII of Naples]] issued excavations following the re-discovery of [[Herculaneum]] in 1738.<ref>The Academy of Real Navy December 10, 1735 was the first institution to be established by Charles III for cadets, followed 18 November 1787 by the Royal Military Academy (later Military School of Naples): {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Goliardia a Pizzofalcone tra il 1841 ed il 1844|journal= L'Ago e Il Filo Edizione Online|date=2013| url=https://www.academia.edu/3394824|language=Italian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.napoliunplugged.com/the-bourbon-dynasty.html|title=The Bourbon Dynasty in Naples|last=Zaragoza|first=Barbara|date=2013-05-02|website=Napoli Unplugged|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref> Excavation work at Herculaneum was done through digging tunnels, and piercing walls, in an attempt to find treasures like paintings, statues and other ornaments to be exhibited in the [[Museum Herculanense]], part of the King's [[Palace of Portici|Royal Palace in Portici]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fastionline.org/docs/FOLDER-con-2015-3.pdf|title=Excavation and conservation at Pompeii: a conflicted history|author=Stefano De Caro|access-date=January 19, 2019|issn=2412-5229|journal=The Journal of FastiOnline: Archaeological Conservation Series|publisher=The International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property}}</ref>\n\nThe Villa of the Papyri was discovered in 1750 by farmers when digging a well.

The exact location of the villa was then lost for two centuries.<ref name=\"herculaneum.ox.ac.uk\"/> In the 1980s work on re-discovering the villa began by studying 18th century documentation on entrances to the tunnels and in 1986 the breakthrough was made through an ancient well. The backfill from some of the tunnels was cleared to allow re-exploration of the villa when it was found that the parts of the villa that survived the earlier excavations were still remarkable in quantity and quality.\n\nExcavation to expose part of the villa was done in the 1990s and revealed two previously undiscovered lower floors to the villa<ref name=\"herculaneum.ox.ac.uk\"/> with frescoes in situ. These were found along the southwest-facing terrace of about 4 metres height. The first row of rooms lying below the arcade was evidenced by a series of rectangular openings along the fa\u00e7ade.\n\n[[File:Affresco Villa dei Papiri 01.JPG|thumb|upright|Fresco from the Villa]]\nLimited excavations recommenced at the site in 2007 to preserve the remains when beautifully carved parts of wood and ivory furniture were discovered. Since then limited public access became available.\n\nAs of 2012, there are still 2,800&nbsp;m{{sup|2}} left to be excavated of the villa. The remainder of the site has not been excavated because the Italian government is preferring [[Archaeological site|conservation]] to excavation, and protecting what has already been uncovered.<ref>See [[conservation issues of Pompeii and Herculaneum]].</ref> [[David Woodley Packard]], who has funded conservation work at Herculaneum through his [[Packard Humanities Institute]], has said that he is likely to be able to fund excavation of the Villa of the Papyri when the authorities agree to it; but no work will be permitted on the site until the completion of a feasibility report, which has been in preparation for some years. The first part of the report emerged in 2008 but included no timetable or cost projections, since the decision for further excavation is a political one.<ref>[http://www.herculaneum.ox.ac.uk/docs/FeasibilityStudy.pdf Feasibility Study]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Politics involve excavation under inhabited areas in addition to unspecified but reported<ref>''[http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24096948-25132,00.html In search of Western civilisation's lost classics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229025208/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24096948-25132,00.html |date=2008-12-29 }}'', ''[[The Australian]]'', August 6, 2008</ref> references to mafia involvement.\n\nUsing <!--http://www.classzone.com/books/earth_science/terc/content/investigations/esu101/esu101page07.cfm-->[[multi-spectral imaging]], a technique developed in the early 1990s, it is possible to read the burned papyri.

Architectural consultant Norman Neuerburg and the curator of Getty's antiquities, [[Ji\u0159\u00ed Frel]], worked closely with Getty and the architects to ensure the accuracy of the museum building's design .\n\nSince the Villa dei Papiri was unexcavated, Neuerburg based many of the villa's architectural and landscaping details on elements from other ancient Roman houses in the towns of Pompeii, Herculaneum, and Stabiae.<ref name=\"getty\">''The Getty''. 2005. J. Paul Getty Museum. 11 May 2007 http://www.getty.edu/visit/see_do/architecture.html.</ref>. For example, the mosaic fountain in the museum's garden peristyle replicates the one in the Nymphaeum of the House of the Large Fountain at Pompeii). \n\nIn 1997, the Getty Museum was relocated to the [[Getty Center]]. The Malibu villa was renovated and reopened in 2006. The reconceived [[Getty Villa]], as it is now called, serves as an annex dedicated to the display of the museum's antiquities and as a center for the study of ancient art.\n\n==In modern literature==\nSeveral scenes in [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' bestselling novel ''[[Pompeii (novel)|Pompeii]]'' are set in the Villa of the Papyri, just before the eruption engulfed it. The villa is mentioned as belonging to Roman aristocrat [[Pedius Cascus]] and his wife [[Rectina]]. ([[Pliny the Younger]] mentions Rectina, whom he calls the wife of Tascius, in Letter 16 of book VI of his ''[[Epistulae (Pliny)|Letters]]''.) At the start of the eruption Rectina prepares to have the library evacuated and sends urgent word to her old friend, [[Pliny the Elder]], who commands the [[Roman Navy]] at [[Misenum]] on the other side of the [[Bay of Naples]]. Pliny immediately sets out in a warship, and gets in sight of the villa, but the eruption prevents him from landing and taking off Rectina and her library&nbsp;\u2013 which is thus left for modern archaeologists to find.\n\n==Works of art==\n===Sculpture from the Villa===\nAccording to the 1908 publication ''Buried Herculaneum'' by Ethel Ross Barker, there were busts of Athene Gorgolopha, Archaistic Pallas, Archaic [[Apollo]], Head of an Amazon, Dionysus or Plato (? Poseidon), [[Doryphorus]], Mercury, Homer, Ptolemy Alexander (Alexander the Great?), Ptolemy Philadelphus, Ptolemy Soter I (Seleucus Nicator I), and the mythological Danaids and others.<ref name=\"Barker\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/buriedherculaneu00barkuoft|title=Buried Herculaneum|author=Ethel Ross Barker|year=1908}}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Satiro ebbro, da villa dei papiri, peristilio rettangolare, 01.JPG|Statue of a drunken [[satyr]] from the Villa\nFile:6018 - Eschine - Napoli.jpg|Statue of [[Aeschines]] from the Villa.

Many of the finds are displayed in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]]. The [[Getty Villa]] is a reproduction of the Villa of the Papyri.\n\n==Layout==\n[[File:Herculaneum, past, present and future (1908) (14596218878).jpg|thumb|500px|Ground plan showing location of tunnels (in brown)]]\nThe villa is located a few hundred metres from the nearest house in [[Herculaneum]]. Although it now lies inland, before the volcanic eruption of October 79 A.D., the structure occupied more than {{convert|250|m|ft}} of coastline along the [[Gulf of Naples]]. On the other sides it was surrounded by a closed garden, vineyards and woods. The villa had four levels beneath the main floor, arranged in terraces overlooking the sea.<ref name=\"herculaneum.ox.ac.uk\">http://www.herculaneum.ox.ac.uk/?q=De%20Simone</ref>It has recently been ascertained that the main floor was {{cvt|16|m|ft}} above sea level in antiquity.\n\n[[File:Escipi\u00f3n africano.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Bronze bust of [[Scipio Africanus]], mid 1st century BC, found in the Villa of the Papyri]]\nThe villa's layout is an expanded version of the traditional Campanian villa suburbana. One entered through the fauces and proceeded to the [[atrium (architecture)|atrium]], which functioned as an entrance hall and a means of communication with the various parts of the house. The entrance opened with a columned portico on the sea side.\n\nAfter passing through the [[tablinum]], one arrived at the first [[peristyle]], made up of ten columns on each side, with a swimming pool in the centre. In this area were found the bronze [[Herma|herm]] adapted from the [[Doryphorus]] of [[Polykleitos]]<nowiki/> and the herm of an [[Amazons|Amazon]] made by Apollonios son of Archias of Athens.<ref name=\"apollonius\">Stewart, Andrew. ''Greek Sculpture''. Yale University Press (1990).</ref> The large second peristyle could be reached by passing through a large tablinum in which, under a [[propylaeum]], was the archaic statue of [[Athena Promachos]]. A collection of bronze busts were in the interior of the tablinum. These included the head of [[Scipio Africanus]].<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\nThe living and reception quarters were grouped around the porticoes and terraces, giving occupants ample sunlight and a view of the countryside and sea. In the living quarters, bath installations were brought to light, and the library of rolled and carbonised papyri placed inside wooden ''capsae'', some of them on ordinary wooden shelves and around the walls and some on the two sides of a set of shelves in the middle of the room.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\nThe grounds included a large area of covered and uncovered gardens for walks in the shade or in the warmth of the sun. The gardens included a gallery of busts, hermae and small marble and bronze statues. These were laid out between columns amid the open part of the garden and on the edges of the large swimming bath.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\n==Works of art==\n[[File:Resting Hermes MAN Napoli Inv5625 n02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Barker identified this sculpture as [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]].

The villa housed a collection of at least 80 sculptures of magnificent quality,<ref>https://sites.google.com/site/ad79eruption/herculaneum-1/villa-of-the-papyri/catalogue-of-sculptures</ref> many now conserved in the [[Naples National Archaeological Museum]].<ref name=\"Amedeo\" /> Among them is the bronze ''[[Seated Hermes]]'', found at the villa in 1758. Around the bowl of the atrium [[impluvium]] were 11 bronze fountain statues depicting [[Satyrs]] pouring water from a pitcher and [[Putto|Amorini]] pouring water from the mouth of a dolphin. Other statues and busts were found in the corners around the atrium walls.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\n[[File:Danzatrici o danaidi, da villa dei papiri, peristilio quadrato.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of dancers from the peristyle.]]\nFive statues of life-sized bronze dancing women wearing the [[Dorians|Doric]] [[peplos]] sculpted in different positions and with inlaid eyes are adapted Roman copies of originals from the fifth century BC. They are also [[hydrophorai]] drawing water from a fountain.\n\n==Epicureanism and the library==\nThe owner of the house, perhaps Calpurnius Piso, established a library of a mainly philosophical character. It is believed that the library might have been collected and selected by Piso's family friend and client, the Epicurean [[Philodemus of G\u00e0dara]], although this conclusion is not certain.<ref name=\"oxford\" /><ref>See Erlend D. MacGillivray, \"The Popularity of Epicureanism in Late-Republic Roman Society\", ''The Ancient World'' XLIII (2012) 151\u2013172.</ref> Followers of [[Epicurus]] studied the teachings of this moral and natural philosopher. This philosophy taught that man is mortal, that the cosmos is the result of accident, that there is no providential god, and that the criteria of a good life are pleasure and temperance. Philodemus' connections with Piso brought him an opportunity to influence the young students of Greek literature and philosophy who gathered around him at [[Herculaneum]] and [[Naples]]. Much of his work was discovered in about a thousand [[Papyri from Herculaneum|papyrus rolls]] in the philosophical library recovered at Herculaneum. Although his prose work is detailed in the strung-out, non-periodic style typical of Hellenistic Greek prose before the revival of the Attic style after [[Cicero]], Philodemus surpassed the average literary standard to which most epicureans aspired. Philodemus succeeded in influencing the most learned and distinguished Romans of his age. None of his prose work was known until the rolls of papyri were discovered among the ruins of the Villa of the Papyri.<ref name=\"oxford\" />\n\n[[Image:Papyri.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|Papyrus recovered from Villa of the Papyri.<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />]]\nAt the time of the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79, the valuable library was packed in cases ready to be moved to safety when it was overtaken by a [[pyroclastic flow]]; the eruption eventually deposited some 20\u201325&nbsp;m of volcanic ash over the site, charring the [[scroll]]s but preserving them \u2013 the only surviving library of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] \u2013 as the ash hardened to form [[tuff]].<ref name=\"Amedeo\" />\n\n==Excavations==\n{{details|Herculaneum papyri}}\nThe [[House of Bourbon]] under [[King Charles VII of Naples]] issued excavations following the re-discovery of [[Herculaneum]] in 1738.<ref>The Academy of Real Navy December 10, 1735 was the first institution to be established by Charles III for cadets, followed 18 November 1787 by the Royal Military Academy (later Military School of Naples): {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Goliardia a Pizzofalcone tra il 1841 ed il 1844|journal= L'Ago e Il Filo Edizione Online|date=2013| url=https://www.academia.edu/3394824|language=Italian}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.napoliunplugged.com/the-bourbon-dynasty.html|title=The Bourbon Dynasty in Naples|last=Zaragoza|first=Barbara|date=2013-05-02|website=Napoli Unplugged|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref> Excavation work at Herculaneum was done through digging tunnels, and piercing walls, in an attempt to find treasures like paintings, statues and other ornaments to be exhibited in the [[Museum Herculanense]], part of the King's [[Palace of Portici|Royal Palace in Portici]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.fastionline.org/docs/FOLDER-con-2015-3.pdf|title=Excavation and conservation at Pompeii: a conflicted history|author=Stefano De Caro|access-date=January 19, 2019|issn=2412-5229|journal=The Journal of FastiOnline: Archaeological Conservation Series|publisher=The International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property}}</ref>\n\nThe Villa of the Papyri was discovered in 1750 by farmers when digging a well.

The backfill from some of the tunnels was cleared to allow re-exploration of the villa when it was found that the parts of the villa that survived the earlier excavations were still remarkable in quantity and quality.\n\nExcavation to expose part of the villa was done in the 1990s and revealed two previously undiscovered lower floors to the villa<ref name=\"herculaneum.ox.ac.uk\"/> with frescoes in situ. These were found along the southwest-facing terrace of about 4 metres height.

The Malibu villa was renovated and reopened in 2006. The reconceived [[Getty Villa]], as it is now called, serves as an annex dedicated to the display of the museum's antiquities and as a center for the study of ancient art.\n\n==In modern literature==\nSeveral scenes in [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]' bestselling novel ''[[Pompeii (novel)|Pompeii]]'' are set in the Villa of the Papyri, just before the eruption engulfed it. The villa is mentioned as belonging to Roman aristocrat [[Pedius Cascus]] and his wife [[Rectina]]. ([[Pliny the Younger]] mentions Rectina, whom he calls the wife of Tascius, in Letter 16 of book VI of his ''[[Epistulae (Pliny)|Letters]]''.) At the start of the eruption Rectina prepares to have the library evacuated and sends urgent word to her old friend, [[Pliny the Elder]], who commands the [[Roman Navy]] at [[Misenum]] on the other side of the [[Bay of Naples]]. Pliny immediately sets out in a warship, and gets in sight of the villa, but the eruption prevents him from landing and taking off Rectina and her library&nbsp;\u2013 which is thus left for modern archaeologists to find.\n\n==Works of art==\n===Sculpture from the Villa===\nAccording to the 1908 publication ''Buried Herculaneum'' by Ethel Ross Barker, there were busts of Athene Gorgolopha, Archaistic Pallas, Archaic [[Apollo]], Head of an Amazon, Dionysus or Plato (? Poseidon), [[Doryphorus]], Mercury, Homer, Ptolemy Alexander (Alexander the Great?), Ptolemy Philadelphus, Ptolemy Soter I (Seleucus Nicator I), and the mythological Danaids and others.<ref name=\"Barker\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/buriedherculaneu00barkuoft|title=Buried Herculaneum|author=Ethel Ross Barker|year=1908}}</ref>\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Satiro ebbro, da villa dei papiri, peristilio rettangolare, 01.JPG|Statue of a drunken [[satyr]] from the Villa\nFile:6018 - Eschine - Napoli.jpg|Statue of [[Aeschines]] from the Villa.
