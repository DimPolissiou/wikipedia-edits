The plot follows a group of high school seniors who are targeted at their [[prom]] by a masked killer seeking vengeance for the accidental death of a young girl six years earlier. It features supporting performances from Casey Stevens, [[Anne-Marie Martin|Eddie Benton]], [[Mary Beth Rubens]] and Michael Tough.\n\n''Prom Night'' was filmed in [[Toronto]] in late 1979 on a budget of $1.5 million. Distributed by [[Embassy Pictures|AVCO Embassy Pictures]], it premiered in the United States in July 1980 in select cities, and was an immediate financial success. Its release platform expanded to major cities such as [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City|New York]] in August, where it was again met with high box-office receipts. At the time, the film was AVCO Embassy's most financially successful release, breaking weekend records in Los Angeles, [[Philadelphia]], and [[New England]].\n\nBy the end of its theatrical run, ''Prom Night'' had grossed $15 million in the United States, and was Canada's highest-earning horror film of 1980. Critical reaction to the film varied, with some, such as [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]], dismissing it for its depictions of [[violence against women]], while others alternately praised the film for its more muted violent content. ''Prom Night'' received some critical accolades, garnering [[Genie Awards|Genie Award]] nominations for editing and for Curtis's leading performance. An alternative cut of the film was popularly aired on American and Canadian television networks in 1981.\n\nIn the intervening years, ''Prom Night'' has accrued a substantial [[cult following]],{{sfn|Wise|2001|p=174}} not only for its horror content but also for its [[disco]]-heavy soundtrack, which was released by [[RCA Records]] in Japan in 1980. Some film scholars have cited ''Prom Night'' as one of the most influential slasher films of the period.{{sfn|Nowell|2010|p=10}} Several companies released the film on video, and it was distributed on [[DVD]] by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] in 1998. A remastered [[Blu-ray]] edition was released by [[Synapse Films]] in 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1974, 11-year-olds Wendy Richards, Jude Cunningham, Kelly Lynch and Nick McBride play hide-and-seek in an abandoned convent. When 10-year-old Robin Hammond tries to join them, the group starts teasing her, repeating \"Kill! Kill! Kill!\", and leading to a scared Robin accidentally falling to her death through a second story window. The children make a pact not to tell anyone what happened and keep the incident a secret and they leave. Just then, a shadow crosses over Robin's body, who witnessed Robin's death.\n\nSix years later in 1980, Robin's family attend her memorial on the anniversary of her death. Robin's teenage sister, Kim, and [[Twin#Dizygotic (fraternal) twins|fraternal twin]] brother, Alex, are preparing for the school prom to be held that evening. Kelly, Jude and Wendy begin receiving anonymous obscene phone calls, while Nick ignores his ringing phone.\n\nKim and Nick are now dating and plan on attending prom together. Jude is asked by goofy jokester Seymour \"Slick\" Crane, who she meets by chance. Kelly is going with Drew, her boyfriend. Wendy\u2014Nick's ex-girlfriend\u2014asks Lou to the prom with the sole purpose of embarrassing Nick and her rival Kim. In the changing room after gym class, Kim and Kelly discover the locker room mirror cracked with a shard missing. Later, Wendy, Jude and Kelly each find their yearbook photos stabbed with a piece of glass. Meanwhile, Kim and Alex's father (also the school principal) learns that the [[sex offender]] blamed for Robin's death has escaped from a psychiatric facility. Lt. McBride, Nick's father, investigates his disappearance.\n\nDuring the senior prom, Kelly and Drew make out in the changing room, but Kelly, a virgin, refuses to have sex and Drew angrily leaves. As Kelly gets dressed, an unidentified figure wearing a [[balaclava (clothing)|ski mask]] and all-black clothing approaches her and slits her throat with a mirror shard. Jude and Slick have sex and smoke marijuana in his van parked outside school grounds. They are attacked by the masked killer, who stabs Jude in the throat. Slick struggles with the killer, who jumps from the vehicle before Slick drives off a cliff to his death. Staking out the prom, McBride is informed that the sex offender blamed for Robin's death has been caught.\n\nNow wielding an ax, the killer confronts and chases Wendy through the school. Evading the killer several times, she screams when she discovers Kelly's body in a storage room and is hacked to death. The [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] school janitor, Sykes, witnesses Wendy's murder and attempts to notify the school staff, but they dismiss it as a drunken rant. Meanwhile, Kim and Nick prepare to be crowned prom king and queen, but Lou and his lackeys tie up Nick, and Lou takes his crown. Mistaking him for Nick, the killer approaches Lou from behind and decapitates him. Lou's severed head rolls onto the dance floor, sending the prom-goers fleeing in horror.\n\nKim finds Nick and frees him. As they prepare to escape, they are confronted by the killer who attacks Nick but not Kim. In the ensuing brawl, Kim strikes the killer's head with the ax. She and the killer stare at each other and Kim realizes his identity. The killer runs outside where the police have arrived. The killer collapses and is then revealed to be Alex, who explains to his sister that he witnessed their sister's death, and that Jude, Kelly, Wendy and Nick were responsible. He cries out Robin's name before dying in Kim's arms. Kim cries over the death of another sibling.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Mr. Hammond\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Kimberly \"Kim\" Hammond\n* Casey Stevens as Nick McBride\n* [[Anne-Marie Martin|Eddie Benton]] as Wendy Richards\n* Michael Tough as Alex Hammond\n* [[Robert A.

The plot follows a group of high school seniors who are targeted at their [[prom]] by a masked killer seeking vengeance for the accidental death of a young girl six years earlier. It features supporting performances from Casey Stevens, [[Anne-Marie Martin|Eddie Benton]], [[Mary Beth Rubens]] and Michael Tough.\n\n''Prom Night'' was filmed in [[Toronto]] in late 1979 on a budget of $1.5 million. Distributed by [[Embassy Pictures|AVCO Embassy Pictures]], it premiered in the United States in July 1980 in select cities, and was an immediate financial success. Its release platform expanded to major cities such as [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City|New York]] in August, where it was again met with high box-office receipts. At the time, the film was AVCO Embassy's most financially successful release, breaking weekend records in Los Angeles, [[Philadelphia]], and [[New England]].\n\nBy the end of its theatrical run, ''Prom Night'' had grossed $15 million in the United States, and was Canada's highest-earning horror film of 1980. Critical reaction to the film varied, with some, such as [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]], dismissing it for its depictions of [[violence against women]], while others alternately praised the film for its more muted violent content. ''Prom Night'' received some critical accolades, garnering [[Genie Awards|Genie Award]] nominations for editing and for Curtis's leading performance. An alternative cut of the film was popularly aired on American and Canadian television networks in 1981.\n\nIn the intervening years, ''Prom Night'' has accrued a substantial [[cult following]],{{sfn|Wise|2001|p=174}} not only for its horror content but also for its [[disco]]-heavy soundtrack, which was released by [[RCA Records]] in Japan in 1980. Some film scholars have cited ''Prom Night'' as one of the most influential slasher films of the period.{{sfn|Nowell|2010|p=10}} Several companies released the film on video, and it was distributed on [[DVD]] by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] in 1998. A remastered [[Blu-ray]] edition was released by [[Synapse Films]] in 2014.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1974, 11-year-olds Wendy Richards, Jude Cunningham, Kelly Lynch and Nick McBride play hide-and-seek in an abandoned convent. When 10-year-old Robin Hammond tries to join them, the group starts teasing her, repeating \"Kill! Kill! Kill!\", and leading to a scared Robin accidentally falling to her death through a second story window. The children make a pact not to tell anyone what happened and keep the incident a secret and they leave. Just then, a shadow crosses over Robin's body, who witnessed Robin's death.\n\nSix years later in 1980, Robin's family attend her memorial on the anniversary of her death. Robin's teenage sister, Kim, and [[Twin#Dizygotic (fraternal) twins|fraternal twin]] brother, Alex, are preparing for the school prom to be held that evening. Kelly, Jude and Wendy begin receiving anonymous obscene phone calls, while Nick ignores his ringing phone.\n\nKim and Nick are now dating and plan on attending prom together. Jude is asked by goofy jokester Seymour \"Slick\" Crane, who she meets by chance. Kelly is going with Drew, her boyfriend. Wendy\u2014Nick's ex-girlfriend\u2014asks Lou to the prom with the sole purpose of embarrassing Nick and her rival Kim. In the changing room after gym class, Kim and Kelly discover the locker room mirror cracked with a shard missing. Later, Wendy, Jude and Kelly each find their yearbook photos stabbed with a piece of glass. Meanwhile, Kim and Alex's father (also the school principal) learns that the [[sex offender]] blamed for Robin's death has escaped from a psychiatric facility. Lt. McBride, Nick's father, investigates his disappearance.\n\nDuring the senior prom, Kelly and Drew make out in the changing room, but Kelly, a virgin, refuses to have sex and Drew angrily leaves. As Kelly gets dressed, an unidentified figure wearing a [[balaclava (clothing)|ski mask]] and all-black clothing approaches her and slits her throat with a mirror shard. Jude and Slick have sex and smoke marijuana in his van parked outside school grounds. They are attacked by the masked killer, who stabs Jude in the throat. Slick struggles with the killer, who jumps from the vehicle before Slick drives off a cliff to his death. Staking out the prom, McBride is informed that the sex offender blamed for Robin's death has been caught.\n\nNow wielding an ax, the killer confronts and chases Wendy through the school. Evading the killer several times, she screams when she discovers Kelly's body in a storage room and is hacked to death. The [[alcoholism|alcoholic]] school janitor, Sykes, witnesses Wendy's murder and attempts to notify the school staff, but they dismiss it as a drunken rant. Meanwhile, Kim and Nick prepare to be crowned prom king and queen, but Lou and his lackeys tie up Nick, and Lou takes his crown. Mistaking him for Nick, the killer approaches Lou from behind and decapitates him. Lou's severed head rolls onto the dance floor, sending the prom-goers fleeing in horror.\n\nKim finds Nick and frees him. As they prepare to escape, they are confronted by the killer who attacks Nick but not Kim. In the ensuing brawl, Kim strikes the killer's head with the ax. She and the killer stare at each other and Kim realizes his identity. The killer runs outside where the police have arrived. The killer collapses and is then revealed to be Alex, who explains to his sister that he witnessed their sister's death, and that Jude, Kelly, Wendy and Nick were responsible. He cries out Robin's name before dying in Kim's arms. Kim cries over the death of another sibling.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Leslie Nielsen]] as Mr. Hammond\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Kimberly \"Kim\" Hammond\n* Casey Stevens as Nick McBride\n* [[Anne-Marie Martin|Eddie Benton]] as Wendy Richards\n* Michael Tough as Alex Hammond\n* [[Robert A.

In July 1997, he was convicted of [[terrorism]] ''[[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]'' by a Yugoslav court. After several unsuccessful attempts to capture or kill him, Serbian police launched [[Attack on Prekaz|an attack]] against Jashari's home in Prekaz in March 1998.

Attempting to capture or kill him, Serbian police surrounded Jashari and his older brother, Ham\u00ebz, at their home in Prekaz on 30 December 1991. In the ensuing siege, large numbers of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Prekaz, pressuring the police to withdraw from the village.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=142}}\n\nWhile in Albania, he was arrested in 1993 by the government of [[Sali Berisha]] and sent to jail in [[Tirana]]{{sfn|Pettifer|Vickers|2007|p=113}} before being released alongside other Kosovo Albanian militants at the demand of the [[Albanian Army]].{{sfn|Pettifer|Vickers|2007|pp=98\u201399}} With the Yugoslav forces now considering Prekaz a \"no-go\" area, Jashari launched several attacks over the next several years.

The next month, a small unit of the KLA ambushed Serbian policemen. Four Serbs were killed and two were injured in the ensuing clashes. At dawn on 5 March 1998, the KLA launched an attack against a police patrol in Prekaz.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=142}}\n\n===Death===\n{{main|Attack on Prekaz}}\nIn response to this attack, the Yugoslavs organized a \"full-scale revenge mission\" involving tanks, [[Armoured personnel carrier|APCs]] and [[helicopter]]s.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|pp=142\u2013143}} They were backed up by [[artillery]] from a nearby ammunition factory.{{sfn|Pettifer|2005|p=144}} With the intention of \"eliminating the suspects and their families,\"{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1998|p=27}} the police attacked villages that had been identified as KLA strongholds, including [[Liko\u0161ane]] and [[\u0106irez]]. Human Rights Watch noted that \"special police forces attacked without warning, firing indiscriminately at women, children and other noncombatants.\" KLA members and their families subsequently fled to Jashari's compound. Here, the police invited Jashari to surrender, giving him a deadline of two hours in which to respond. During this period, a number of families left the compound.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=143}} Jashari remained, ordering his family members to stay inside and telling his militants to resist to the last man.{{sfn|Henriksen|2007|p=127}}\n\nOnce the two-hour deadline had expired, the two sides began exchanging gunfire. In one of the houses, where most of Jashari's extended family had gathered, a mortar shell fell in through the roof, causing many deaths. After a two{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=143}} or three-day siege, the police captured the Jashari compound.{{sfn|Judah|2008|p=81}} Once inside, they discovered that Jashari and his brother Ham\u00ebz had been killed.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=143}} Also killed were Jashari's wife, Adilje, and his thirteen-year-old son, Kushtrim.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1998|p=29}} Overall, approximately fifty-eight Kosovo Albanians were killed in the attack, including eighteen women and ten children under the age of sixteen.{{sfn|Human Rights Watch|1998|p=28}}{{sfn|Judah|2002|p=140}} [[Goran Radosavljevi\u0107]], a major in the Serbian [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Serbia)|Interior Ministry]], said that \"[Jashari] used women, children and the elderly as hostages.\"{{sfn|Henriksen|2007|p=128}} Speaking of the attack, Yugoslav General [[Neboj\u0161a Pavkovi\u0107]] stated that it was \"a normal policing action against a well-known criminal.

Attempting to capture or kill him, Serbian police surrounded Jashari and his older brother, Ham\u00ebz, at their home in Prekaz on 30 December 1991. In the ensuing siege, large numbers of Kosovo Albanians flocked to Prekaz, pressuring the police to withdraw from the village.{{sfn|Bartrop|2012|p=142}}\n\nWhile in Albania, he was arrested in 1993 by the government of [[Sali Berisha]] and sent to jail in [[Tirana]]{{sfn|Pettifer|Vickers|2007|p=113}} before being released alongside other Kosovo Albanian militants at the demand of the [[Albanian Army]].{{sfn|Pettifer|Vickers|2007|pp=98\u201399}} With the Yugoslav forces now considering Prekaz a \"no-go\" area, Jashari launched several attacks over the next several years.

Human Rights Watch noted that \"special police forces attacked without warning, firing indiscriminately at women, children and other noncombatants.\" KLA members and their families subsequently fled to Jashari's compound. Here, the police invited Jashari to surrender, giving him a deadline of two hours in which to respond.

In keeping with this approach, a modern visitor centre, the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience, was built into a hillside approaching the cliffs. The centre was planned to be environmentally sensitive in its use of renewable energy systems including geothermal heating and cooling, solar panels, and grey water recycling.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.constructireland.ie/articles/0218cliffsofmoher.php | title = Eco technology in Cliffs of Moher underground centre | publisher = ConstructIreland.ie | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120312134246/http://www.constructireland.ie/articles/0218cliffsofmoher.php | archivedate = 12 March 2012 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe \u20ac32 million facility was planned and built over a 17-year period and officially opened in February 2007.

To counter this, visitors are increasingly encouraged to come at other times, with discounts given to coach operators who book for off-peak slots, and late opening of the centre introduced for July and much of August.

During the time of their formation between 313 and 326 million years ago, a river dumped sand, silt and clay into an ancient marine basin. Over millions of years, the sediments collecting at the mouth of this ancient delta were compacted and lithified into the sedimentary strata preserved in the now-exposed cliffs. The area is considered a geologic laboratory that preserves a record of deltaic deposition in deep water. Individual strata vary in thickness from just a few centimeters to several meters, each representing a specific depositional event in the history of the delta. In aggregate, up to 200 meters of sedimentary rocks are exposed in the Cliffs of Moher. [[Trace fossils]] are abundant, comprising two main types: (1) [[scolicia]] or worming trails, which are interpreted as feeding trails left by as-yet-unidentified invertebrates, and (2) burrow marks, which are circular features preserved as casts of burrows once occupied by as-yet-unidentified marine creatures. Ripple marks are preserved in some stones.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cliffs of Moher Geology |url=https://www.cliffsofmoher.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Cliffs-of-Moher-Geology.pdf |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nToday the cliffs are subject to erosion by wave action, which undermines the base of support causing the cliff to collapse under its own weight. This process creates a variety of coastal landforms characteristic of erosional coasts such as sea caves, [[Stack (geology)|sea stack]], and sea stumps. Branaunmore, a 67-meter high sea stack at the foot of the Cliffs of Moher below O'Brien's Tower, was once part of the cliffs, but coastal erosion gradually removed the layers of rock that joined it with the mainland.

Branaunmore, a 67-meter high sea stack at the foot of the Cliffs of Moher below O'Brien's Tower, was once part of the cliffs, but coastal erosion gradually removed the layers of rock that joined it with the mainland. A large sea arch can also be seen at Hag's Head below the Napoleonic signal tower and many smaller sea arches can be seen from sea level.<ref>{{cite web |title=Cliffs of Moher Geology |url=https://www.cliffsofmoher.ie/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Cliffs-of-Moher-Geology.pdf |accessdate=8 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible to see 300-million-year-old river channels cutting through, forming [[Unconformity|unconformities]] at the base of the cliffs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nAt peak season, there are an estimated 30,000 pairs of birds living on the cliffs, representing more than 20 species.<ref name=\"birds\">{{cite web | url = http://www.discoverireland.com/us/ireland-things-to-see-and-do/listings/gss/product/?fid=FI_13325 | publisher = DiscoverIreland.com \u2013 Official tourism website | title = Birdwatching at the Cliffs of Moher | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110710132642/http://www.discoverireland.com/us/ireland-things-to-see-and-do/listings/gss/product/?fid=FI_13325 | archivedate = 10 July 2011 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> These include [[Atlantic puffin]]s, which live in large colonies at isolated parts of the cliffs and on the small Goat Island,<ref name=\"birds\"/> and [[razorbill]]s.\nThe site is an [[Important Bird Area]].<ref name=\"bi\">{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/sitefactsheet.php?id=584 |title=Important Bird Areas factsheet: Cliffs of Moher |publisher=BirdLife International |accessdate=16 June 2015 }} Downloaded from {{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-12-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5QE8rvIqH?url=http://www.birdlife.org/ |archivedate=10 July 2007 |df=dmy }}.</ref>\n\nA wide range of sea life can also be seen, from [[grey seal]]s through [[porpoise]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[minke whale]]s and [[basking shark]]s, as well as, occasionally, [[Opah|sunfish]].

The province was formed in 1954 when the former [[Hwanghae]] Province was split into [[North Hwanghae|North]] and South Hwanghae. The provincial capital is [[Haeju]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe province is part of the [[Haeso]] [[Regions of Korea|region]], and is bounded on the west by the [[Yellow Sea]], on the north and east by [[North Hwanghae]] province. There are some administrative exclaves of [[Nampo]] City in the north of the province. The southern border of the province is marked by the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] with [[South Korea]]. The province draws its name from what were the largest cities in Hwanghae, [[Haeju]] and [[Hwangju]]; the name, which literally means \"Yellow Sea\" in [[Korean language|Korean]], also references the Yellow Sea, which forms the province's western bound.\n\nThe coastline of South Hwanghae is dotted by many small islands, many of which are uninhabited. Many of the largest islands, such as [[Baengnyeong-do]] are administered by South Korea. The [[Northern Limit Line]], which runs through the region and demarcates a disputed [[maritime boundary]] between the north and south, is another frequent subject of contention between the two countries. The largest islands which indisputably belong to North Korea are [[Kirin-do]], [[Changrin-do]], and [[Sunwi-do]].\n\nThe province, being not very mountainous, is uniquely suited to farming, and is thus often referred to as the \"bread-basket\" of North Korea. Much of the land is devoted to farming, and thus was not hit as hard as other parts of the country during the [[Arduous March]] of the 1990s. Many types of vegetables, fruits, grains, and rice are grown on the plains of the region; [[Kwail]] County, which means fruit in Korean, was founded to grow orchards.\n\n[[Haeju]], the provincial capital, is also the largest port in southern North Korea outside of [[Wonsan]]. The area is also home to several ancient [[burial mounds]] and cultural relics, such as the [[Kangsosa]] Buddhist temple, ancient stone pagodas, and a Koryo-era ice house. There are also many Iron Age dolmen and Koguryo tombs in the province, such as [[Anak Tomb No. 3]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n[[Image:South hwanghae counties.png|thumb|left|300px|Counties and city of South Hwanghae Province]]\nSouth Hwanghae is divided into 1 city (''si'') and 19 counties (''gun'').

Enjoying initial success in the first few days, Hantz grew frustrated of the laid-back mentality from his fellow tribe-mates and began actively searching for, and locating, a [[Survivor (franchise)#Hidden immunity idols|Hidden Immunity Idol]]. Wanting to cause paranoia, Hantz announced his intention to play the hidden immunity idol at their first Tribal Council. During this time he formed allegiances with Samuel Hinton, [[Monika Radulovic]] and Damien Thomlinson. After losing the second Immunity Challenge, Hantz attempted to orchestrate a split vote between Jackie Glazier and [[Shane Gould]] but a counter-alliance led by [[Moana Hope]] forced a tie in the event Hantz' hidden immunity idol was played. At Tribal Council, Hantz did not play his hidden immunity idol leading to a revote between himself and Glazier. At the revote, Thomlinson stayed loyal to Hantz with the rest of the vote eliminating him in a unanimous decision. He finished in 23rd place.\n\n===Information leaks===\nIn 2011, Hantz was accused of violating his ''Survivor'' contract by leaking information regarding the show's results. Late in the previous year, a man named Jim Early was sued by [[executive producer]] and ''Survivor'' creator [[Mark Burnett]]'s DJB Inc., for successfully spoiling ''Survivor: Samoa'' and ''Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains'' on a ''Survivor'' [[fansite]] known as ''Survivor Sucks''. The lawsuit accused Early of \"misappropriation of trade secrets\u201d and \"tortious interference with contract.\" The charges were dropped on January 13, 2011, after Early provided to an attorney an email, which allegedly confirmed Hantz as source of the spoilers. Early claims that he had originally made contact with Hantz via telephone to warn him that someone had posted his private information online, but that Hantz had recontacted him later and begun revealing accurate information about the show's outcome, which Early posted to the fansite. Thus far, no legal action has been taken against Hantz, although contestants who reveal information regarding a season's results may face [[liquidated damages]] of $5 million.<ref name=\"Survivor Spy\" /> In an interview with ''[[USA today]]'', Hantz denied the accusations, commenting, \"See, that's another thing. I am the villain, and its unfair that people perceive me that way, and they throw out things that's not fair to me or my family, and I guess I got to deal with it. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to comment on this or not, but it is 100% false.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2011-02-15-survivor15_ST_N.htm | title = Russell, Rob fight for redemption in new 'Survivor' | first = Lindsay | last = Deutsch | date = February 14, 2011 | accessdate =September 22, 2013 | work = [[USA Today]] }}</ref>\n\n==Other television appearances==\nOn February 10, 2010, Hantz and ten other contestants from ''Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains'' made a special appearance on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' to present the show's Top Ten List.<ref>{{cite web|last=Floyd|first=Nancy|title=Survivor: Heroes Vs.

Enjoying initial success in the first few days, Hantz grew frustrated of the laid-back mentality from his fellow tribe-mates and began actively searching for, and locating, a [[Survivor (franchise)#Hidden immunity idols|Hidden Immunity Idol]]. Wanting to cause paranoia, Hantz announced his intention to play the hidden immunity idol at their first Tribal Council. During this time he formed allegiances with Samuel Hinton, [[Monika Radulovic]] and Damien Thomlinson. After losing the second Immunity Challenge, Hantz attempted to orchestrate a split vote between Jackie Glazier and [[Shane Gould]] but a counter-alliance led by [[Moana Hope]] forced a tie in the event Hantz' hidden immunity idol was played. At Tribal Council, Hantz did not play his hidden immunity idol leading to a revote between himself and Glazier. At the revote, Thomlinson stayed loyal to Hantz with the rest of the vote eliminating him in a unanimous decision. He finished in 23rd place.\n\n===Information leaks===\nIn 2011, Hantz was accused of violating his ''Survivor'' contract by leaking information regarding the show's results. Late in the previous year, a man named Jim Early was sued by [[executive producer]] and ''Survivor'' creator [[Mark Burnett]]'s DJB Inc., for successfully spoiling ''Survivor: Samoa'' and ''Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains'' on a ''Survivor'' [[fansite]] known as ''Survivor Sucks''. The lawsuit accused Early of \"misappropriation of trade secrets\u201d and \"tortious interference with contract.\" The charges were dropped on January 13, 2011, after Early provided to an attorney an email, which allegedly confirmed Hantz as source of the spoilers. Early claims that he had originally made contact with Hantz via telephone to warn him that someone had posted his private information online, but that Hantz had recontacted him later and begun revealing accurate information about the show's outcome, which Early posted to the fansite. Thus far, no legal action has been taken against Hantz, although contestants who reveal information regarding a season's results may face [[liquidated damages]] of $5 million.<ref name=\"Survivor Spy\" /> In an interview with ''[[USA today]]'', Hantz denied the accusations, commenting, \"See, that's another thing. I am the villain, and its unfair that people perceive me that way, and they throw out things that's not fair to me or my family, and I guess I got to deal with it. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to comment on this or not, but it is 100% false.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2011-02-15-survivor15_ST_N.htm | title = Russell, Rob fight for redemption in new 'Survivor' | first = Lindsay | last = Deutsch | date = February 14, 2011 | accessdate =September 22, 2013 | work = [[USA Today]] }}</ref>\n\n==Other television appearances==\nOn February 10, 2010, Hantz and ten other contestants from ''Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains'' made a special appearance on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show with David Letterman]]'' to present the show's Top Ten List.<ref>{{cite web|last=Floyd|first=Nancy|title=Survivor: Heroes Vs.
