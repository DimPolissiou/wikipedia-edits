Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC&pg=PA163 ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt''], David Frankfurter, BRILL, 1998, {{ISBN|90-04-11127-1}}, page 163</ref>\n\nThe Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' \u2013 Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&lpg=PA60&pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher=University of California Press |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-520-07196-4 |pages=60\u201361 }}</ref> The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the region starting from [[Cilicia]], where the Euphrates river makes its descent into [[Syria]], through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.<ref>See for example Palestine: The Reality, [[Joseph Mary Nagle Jeffries]], Published by Longmans, Green and co., 1939, [https://archive.org/details/PalestineTheReality/page/n4/mode/1up Page 11]</ref>\n\n''The provinces of Arabia were:'' Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hedjaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.<ref>see Review of Reviews and World's Work: An International Magazine, Albert Shaw ed., The Review of Reviews Corporation, 1919, page 408]</ref><ref name=nie>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GRUoAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA795&pg=PA795|title=New International Encyclopedia \u2013 2nd Edition, Dodd, Mead, Co., 1914 |page= 795|work=google.com|year=1914 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:HistoricCoins.jpg|thumb|Ancient coins from [[Failaka Island]], [[Kuwait]]]]\nThe history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 130,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uerpmann|first=Hans-Peter|last2=Usik|first2=Vitaly I.|last3=Parker|first3=Adrian G.|last4=Marks|first4=Anthony E.|last5=Jasim|first5=Sabah A.|last6=Armitage|first6=Simon J.|date=2011-01-28|title=The Southern Route \"Out of Africa\": Evidence for an Early Expansion of Modern Humans into Arabia|journal=Science|language=en|volume=331|issue=6016|pages=453\u2013456|doi=10.1126/science.1199113|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21273486}}</ref> However, a [[Homo sapiens]] fossilized finger bone was found at [[Al Wusta (Saudi Arabia)|Al Wusta]] in the [[Nefud Desert]], which indicates that the first human migration out of Africa to Arabia might date back to approximately 90,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-04/mpif-fhm040418.php|title=First human migration out of Africa more geographically widespread than previously thought|work=Eurek Alert|date=9 April 2018}}</ref> Nevertheless, the stone tools from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] age along with fossils of other animals discovered at Ti's al Ghadah, in northwestern Saudi Arabia, might imply that hominids migrated through a \"Green Arabia\" between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Roberts | first1=Patrick | last2=Stewart | first2=Mathew | last3=Alagaili | first3=Abdulaziz N. | last4=Breeze | first4=Paul | last5=Candy | first5=Ian | last6=Drake | first6=Nick | last7=Groucutt | first7=Huw S. | last8=Scerri | first8=Eleanor M.

The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India.

Arabs living in one of the existing districts of the Arabian peninsula, the Emirate of [[Hejaz]], asked for a British guarantee of independence. Their proposal included all Arab lands south of a line roughly corresponding to the northern frontiers of present-day Syria and Iraq. They envisioned a new Arab state, or confederation of states, adjoining the southern Arabian Peninsula. It would have comprised [[Cilicia]] \u2013 [[\u0130skenderun]] and [[Mersin]], [[Iraq]] with [[Kuwait]], [[Syria]], [[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate]], [[Jordan]], and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]].<ref>As cited by R, John and S. Hadawi's, Palestine Diary, pp. 30\u201331, the 'Damascus Protocol' stated: \"The recognition by Great Britain of the independence of the Arab countries lying within the following frontiers: North: The Line Mersin_Adana to parallel 37N. and thence along the line Birejek-Urga-Mardin-Kidiat-Jazirat (Ibn 'Unear)-Amadia to the Persian frontier; East: The Persian frontier down to the Persian Gulf; South: The Indian Ocean (with the exclusion of Aden, whose status was to be maintained).

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to the war in Yemen as their [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref name=enein>{{Cite news |issue=Jan\u2013Feb, 2004 |last=Aboul-Enein |first=Youssef |title=The Egyptian-Yemen War: Egyptian perspectives on Guerrilla warfare |work=Infantry Magazine |access-date=October 3, 2008 |date=2004-01-01 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203161830/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-02-03}}</ref>\n\n====Gulf War====\nIn 1990, [[Iraq]] invaded Kuwait.<ref>see Richard Schofield, Kuwait and Iraq: Historical Claims and Territorial.

Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region.

The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India.

Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the [[Hejaz]]. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the [[Hejaz]], they were usually subject to the [[suzerainty]] of one of the major Islamic empires of the time.

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed.

The current [[Ram Pickup (fifth generation)|'''fifth-generation Ram''']] debuted at the [[North American International Auto Show#2018|2018 North American International Auto Show]] in [[Detroit]], Michigan in January of that year.\n\nPreviously, Ram was part of the [[Dodge]] line of light trucks. The name ''Ram'' was first used in 1981 Dodge Trucks following the retiring and rebadging of the [[Dodge D Series]] pickup trucks as well as B-series vans, though the company had used a ram's-head hood ornament on some trucks as early as 1933.<ref name=\"ED-DRG\" />\n\nRam trucks have been named ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year| Truck of the Year]] seven times; the second-generation Ram won the award in 1994, the third-generation Ram ''Heavy Duty'' won the award in 2003, the fourth-generation Ram Heavy Duty won in 2010 and the fourth-generation Ram 1500 won in 2013 and 2014, and the current [[Ram Pickup (fifth generation)|fifth-generation]] Ram 1500 won in 2019 and 2020. \n \n{{TOC left}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==First generation (1981; D/W)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = 89DodgeRam F34.jpg\n| caption = 1989 Ram D100\n| production = 1981\u20131993\n| platform = [[Chrysler AD platform]]\n| body_style = 2-door pickup truck<br />2-door extended cab pickup truck<br />4-door crew cab pickup truck\n| wheelbase = Regular cab/6.5' bed:<br />{{convert|115|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Regular cab/8' bed:<br />{{convert|131|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Club Cab/6.5' bed:<br />{{convert|133|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Club Cab/8' bed:<br />{{convert|149|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Crew cab/8' bed:<br />{{convert|165|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n| length = {{convert|190.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br /> {{convert|210.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|76|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />{{convert|73|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine = {{convert|225|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine#225|slant-6]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br />{{convert|239|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine#239 V6|LA V6]]<br />{{convert|318|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|LA V8]]<br />{{convert|360|cuin|L|abbr=on}} LA V8<br />{{convert|5.9|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Cummins B Series engine#B5.9|Cummins]] [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n| transmission = 3- or 4-speed ''[[Torqueflite]]'' automatic<br />4- or 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n| related = [[Dodge Ramcharger]]\n}}\n\nThe first-generation Ram trucks and vans introduced in 1981 featured a Ram hood ornament first used on Dodge vehicles from 1932 to 1954.<ref name=\"ED-DRG\">{{cite web |title=Dodge Ram - Generations |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46028 |publisher=Edmunds.com |first=John |last=DiPietro |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080801102809/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D46028 |archivedate=2008-08-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Not all of the first-generation trucks have this ornament and is most commonly seen on [[four-wheel-drive]] models. Dodge kept the previous generation's model designations: \"D\" or ''Ram'' indicated [[two-wheel drive]] while \"W\" or ''Power Ram'' indicated [[four-wheel drive]]. Just like [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], Dodge used 150 to indicate a half-ton truck, 250 for a three-quarter-ton truck, and 350 for a one-ton truck. The truck models were offered in standard cab, \"Club\" extended cab, and crew cab configurations. They also were offered along with {{convert|6.5|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} bed lengths and \"Utiline\" and \"Sweptline\" styled boxes along with standard boxes. Externally, the first-generation Rams were facelifted versions of the previous generation Dodge D-Series pickups introduced in 1972. The new model introduced larger wraparound [[Automotive lighting|tail lamps]], dual rectangular [[headlamp]]s, and squared-off body lines. Engine choices were pared down to the [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|225 Slant-6]] and [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|318]] and [[Chrysler LA engine#360 V8|360 V8s]]. The interior was updated and included a new bench seat and a completely new dashboard and instrument cluster with an optional three-pod design - a speedometer in the center, with the two side pods containing an ammeter on the top left, a temperature gauge bottom left, a fuel gauge on the top right and an oil pressure gauge bottom right. Models without the full gauge package had only indicator lights in the place of the temperature and oil pressure gauges. Among the options offered on the Ram were front bumper guards, a sliding rear cab window, air-conditioning, cruise control, tilt steering column, power door locks and windows, AM/FM stereo with cassette tape player, styled road wheels, aluminum turbine-style mag wheels, special paint and stripe packages, two-tone paint, and a plow package for four-wheel-drive models (referred to as the Sno Commander).\n\nThe \"Club Cab\" was dropped from the lineup after 1982, but Dodge kept the tooling and re-introduced nearly a decade later in the 1991 models. The four-door crew cab and Utiline beds were dropped after the 1985 model year, to make room on the assembly line for the upcoming 1987 [[Dodge Dakota]], and were never reintroduced in this generation.\n\nBasic Ram 100 models were reintroduced for 1984, replacing the previous \"Miser\" trim level available on the Ram 150. A \"Ram-Trac\" shift-on-the-fly transfer case was added for the 1985 Power Rams, and both the crew cab and Utiline flared bed were dropped for 1986. In 1988 the Slant-6 engine was replaced by a {{convert|3.9|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler LA engine#239 V6|V6]] engine. The {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine also received [[electronic fuel injection]] in 1988. Because of a new computer controlled fuel injection, ignition and ABS system, more vehicle information needed to be displayed through any warning or notification lights; so inside the cab where a small compartment was once located on the dash, a new \"message center\" with four small rectangular light spots, contained the [[check engine light]] and other [[Tell-tale (automotive)|tell-tales]] including one for the parking brake and the [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] if the truck was so equipped. The message center later included \"Wait to Start\" and \"Water in Fuel\" lights on diesel models. Diagnostic fault codes were stored in the computer's memory, and cycling the ignition key three times would allow the computer to flash the trouble codes through the check-engine light for diagnosis of some problems.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/fix/80s-codes.html |title=Retrieving fault codes |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=2010-11-22}}</ref> Rear [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] became standard equipment in 1989.\n\nThe Ram 100 model designation was dropped and these models folded back into the 150 range for 1990, due to the introduction and sales success of the [[Dodge Dakota]] pickup. Additionally, the instrument cluster was slightly revised; the [[ammeter]] was replaced by a [[voltmeter]] while maintaining the 3-pod arrangement of the speedometer and gauges. Also in 1990, Dodge reintroduced the Club Cab, equipped with fold-out jump seats for the 1991-1993 models. Entry was made through the passenger or driver's doors, as there were no rear doors for this configuration.\n\nThese trucks, though popular with fleets, sold poorly compared to the [[Ford F-Series]] and the [[Chevrolet C/K|General Motors C/K Trucks]], with just under 100,000 units sold most years of their production. Part of this was due to the dated cab and chassis design which had been in production since 1972, there was no powerful diesel option until 1989, and there was no big-block gas V8 option. Additionally, the interior had been given few updates since 1981.\n\n===Engines & transmissions===\nFor 1989, the 5.9&nbsp;L V8 received throttle-body [[fuel injection]] for a 20&nbsp;hp (15&nbsp;kW) gain. Additionally, Dodge introduced a new [[Torqueflite|overdrive automatic transmission]] for reduced fuel consumption. This light-duty transmission was designated the A500, and was offered with the 3.9&nbsp;L V6 and 5.2&nbsp;L V8. An \"O/D Off\" pushbutton switch to lock out the overdrive 4th gear was added to the message center. The [[TorqueFlite#A727 .2836RH.2F37RH.29|A727 automatic]] saw continued use for some 5.2&nbsp;L engines, all 5.9&nbsp;L engines, and heavy-duty applications.\n\nThe grille was redesigned for 1991 but kept the large rectangular [[headlamp]]s and crossbar appearance. The engines were substantially [[Chrysler LA engine|upgraded]] for 1992 (3.9&nbsp;L and 5.2&nbsp;L) 1993 and 1994 (5.9&nbsp;L) with multi-port fuel injection, new manifolds, and higher-compression cylinder heads for noticeably higher output. These newly-revised engines were marketed under the \"Magnum\" name. A heavy-duty automatic transmission with overdrive called the [[TorqueFlite#A518 .2846RH.2F46RE.29|A518]] was offered with the 5.2&nbsp;L and 5.9&nbsp;L engines. As part of Chrysler's overhaul of corporate transmission nomenclature, the A500 and A518 were redesignated 42RH and 46RH, respectively, in 1992. The initial \"4\" signified a 4-speed transmission, the second digit identified the transmission's relative torque capacity, the letter \"R\" in the third position denoted a rear-wheel-drive transmission, and the final letter \"H\" signified hydraulic shift control. The 3-speed automatic remained available; the A727 was redesignated 36RH, and the A904, A998, and A999 became the 30RH, 31RH, and 32RH, respectively.\n\n====5.9 Cummins====\n[[File:1993 Dodge Ram W250 Club Cab 4x4 Cummins td.jpg|thumb|1993 W250 Club Cab]]\nA [[Cummins B Series engine]] was also added to the engine lineup in 1989.<ref name=\"AllparCummins\">{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/cummins-diesel.html |title=Cummins 5.9-liter and 6.7-liter inline six-cylinder diesel engines |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-24}}</ref> For the first time, Dodge saw sales increase. The Cummins was coupled with a heavier-duty version of the [[TorqueFlite#A727|A727 automatic]] or a 5-speed [[manual transmission]] and is available on 250 and 350 pickups and pickup-based chassis-cab trucks. This diesel engine option was different from the optional diesels in Ford and GM trucks. The Cummins features direct injection, whereas the Ford and GM diesels feature [[indirect injection]]; this also means that the Cummins does not have to rely on [[glowplug]]s. The Cummins is a [[straight-six engine]], whereas the GM and Ford diesel engines are V8 engines. Additionally, the Cummins is [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]], while the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine|6.2&nbsp;L GM/DDC]] and [[International Harvester IDI|7.3 IDI Ford/IH]] are [[naturally aspirated]].<ref name=\"AllparCummins\"/>\n\nPre-1994 Cummins-engined Dodge pickups are often termed a \"First-Gen Cummins\".\n\nThis was not the first engine to appear in Dodge pickup trucks as a diesel option. The 1978 and 1979 D-Series models were available with a Mitsubishi naturally-aspirated diesel, but it was seldom ordered.<ref name=\"AllparCummins\"/>\n\nIn the middle of 1991, Dodge started using 350 frames in Ram 250 diesels, club cabs and crew cabs.<ref>http://1stgen.org/viewtopic.php?t=5143</ref>\n\n====Engines====\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n|-\n|1981\u20131987||{{convert|225|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|Slant-6]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]]||{{convert|95|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|170|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|1988\u20131991||{{convert|239|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 3.9L|LA]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||{{convert|125|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|195|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|1992\u20131993||{{convert|239|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 3.9L|Magnum]]'' V6 ||{{convert|175|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|225|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|1981\u20131987||{{convert|318|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|LA]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]||{{convert|140|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|240|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|1988\u20131991||{{convert|318|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|LA]]'' V8 ||{{convert|170|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|1992\u20131993||{{convert|318|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.2|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|1981\u20131988||{{convert|360|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#360 V8|LA]]'' V8 ||{{convert|175|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|1989\u20131992||{{convert|360|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#360 V8|LA]]'' V8 ||{{convert|190|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|292|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|1993||{{convert|360|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#cummins 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|325|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|1989\u20131993||{{convert|359\n|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Cummins B Series engine#B 5.9|Cummins diesel]]'' I6 ||{{convert|160|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|400|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|}\n\n;Gallery\n{{gallery | height = 130\n|File:1983 D150 with SLANT6.jpg|1983 Dodge Ram D150\n|File:89RamIP.jpg|1989 Dodge Ram interior\n|File:Dodge Ram 150 LE -- 11-29-2010 1.jpg|1991\u20131993 Dodge Ram 150, showing facelifted grille\n|File:1991-93 Dodge Ram 250 Club Cab Cummins.jpg|1991-1993 Dodge Ram 250 Club Cab\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Special editions===\n*'''Prospector''' - Prospector was a package available throughout the 1980s that usually included a different fuel tank, cloth seat and carpeting.

A review by the Dodge pick-up truck studio designers felt that modern pick-ups looked \"too flat and sedan-like\", while the [[Studebaker E-series truck|early 1950s Studebaker pick-up]] and the [[semi-trailer truck]]s had just the right \"macho\" look to them.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.htm&r=29&f=G&l=50&d=PTXT&S1=%22dodge+ram%22&OS=%22dodge+ram%22&RS=%22dodge+ram%22 |title=U.S. Patent D396,828 - Body Styling of 1994 Dodge Ram |publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office |date=August 11, 1998 |accessdate=2010-11-22}}</ref> The design featured a [[big rig|big-rig]]-looking front end and a large grille that was deemed risky at its introduction, but ultimately proved popular with consumers.<ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\">{{cite web |url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/dodge/ram-1500/1994/1994-dodge-ram-1500-laramie-slt/ |title=1994 Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie SLT - Long-Term Wrap-Up |author=Killeen, Scott |work=Motor Trend |date=February 1, 1996 |accessdate=February 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\nMaking its debut on January 5, 1993 at the [[North American International Auto Show]] and going on sale on October 1, 1993, the redesigned 1994 Ram was a sales success and was named \"[[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Truck of the Year]]\" by ''[[Motor Trend]]'' in 1994.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/1993/01/06/business/company-news-new-pickup-is-displayed-by-chrysler.html</ref><ref name=\"Truckoftheyear\"/> Sales increased from 95,542 units in 1993 to 232,092 in 1994, 410,000 in 1995, and 411,000 by 1996. That year, it was prominently featured as the hero vehicle in the film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1996/06/01/reels-and-reels-of-wheels/cf2cbd8b-c945-47ac-9c31-3e970910fca7/?noredirect=on |title=Reels and Reels of Wheels |first=Warren |last=Brown |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 1, 1996 |accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.motorious.com/articles/news/315749/twister-replica-dodge-ram-sure-to-kick-up-a-storm-at-auction |title=Twister Replica Dodge Ram Sure To Kick Up A Storm At Auction |first=Tyler |last=Heatley |website=Motorious |date=March 28, 2019 |accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> Sales of this generation peaked at just over 400,000 in 1999 before declining against the redesigned [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks. By 2001, Ram sales figures were below those of Ford and Chevy trucks.\n\nEngine offerings continued over from the first-generation Ram and were the 3.9&nbsp;L V6, 5.2&nbsp;L V8, 5.9&nbsp;L V8, and 5.9&nbsp;L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] Cummins turbo diesel. Added to the line up was a new 488 cubic inch 8.0L V10 engine designed as an alternative for those who wanted superior pulling power but did not want a diesel. The new [[V10 engine|V10]] and Cummins turbo diesel could only be had in the 2500 and higher designation models. Models were now the 1500 half-ton, 2500 three-quarter-ton, and 3500 dual-rear-wheel one-ton in both 2- and 4-wheel drive. 1500 Rams offered both 6.5- and 8-foot (2 and 2.4 m, respectively) boxes. 2500 Rams offered {{convert|6.5|ft|m|adj=on}} boxes with club or quad Cabs.\n\nDodge offered the 2500 series in two different gross-vehicle-weight ratings for the first few years, but this was later dropped. The purpose of the difference between the light-duty and heavy-duty 2500 trucks was for the heavy-duty 2500 to take the place of the discontinued one-ton single-rear-wheel trucks. Rear axles for the light-duty 2500 trucks were [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|semi-floating]], while the heavy-duty 2500 rear axles were [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|full-floating]].\n\nOn the inside, special attention was paid to in-cab storage features, with a large glovebox, a center armrest storage area, and extra storage space behind the seat. The dash and gauge cluster were a far cry from the previous model Ram and were far more modern as well. A redesign of the dashboard and instrument cluster was introduced in 1998 along with the introduction of the quad cab, and rounded black plastic side-view mirrors replaced the previous rectangular design.\n\n===1998 updates===\nIn 1998, Dodge introduced the \"Quad Cab\", which uses smaller, [[suicide doors]] directly behind the main doors. This was offered as an option on the \"Club Cab\" for this model year. Other changes for 1998 included rounded mirrors replacing the classic square ones, a revised interior, dual airbags, a chime replacing the buzzer for seat belts/door ajar/headlights/ and a digital [[odometer]]. The [[OBD II]] System was also standard, with a computer port near the driver's-side footwell and a code-checking system via the new digital [[odometer]] readout.\n\nIn late 1998 Dodge introduced a revised front end for the 1999 model year Sport models with a restyled bumper, quad-beam clear-lens [[headlamp]]s, and body-color grille. A 6-speed manual transmission was made optional for diesel variants in late 2000 for the 2001 model year. A small percentage of the diesel engines for 1999 and 2000 model years were subject to problems within the water jackets and fuel injectors. The most problematic was the \"53\" stamped engine block which had a defect that would cause fracturing in the structure of the block itself. The 2000 models became optional with heated leather seats. The braking system was upgraded to dual-piston calipers in the front. An Offroad Edition was offered as a package with a 2-inch lift accomplished with stiffer front springs and rear lift blocks, unique 17x8 wheels, 275/70/17 all terrain tires, 4.10 gears, trussed Dana 44 in the front, limited slip differential, and skid plates.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/ram1.html |title=200 Dodge Ram specifications |publisher=pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=January 27, 2014}}</ref> The Offroad Edition models are also distinguishable with an additional decal on the tailgate under the 4x4 decal that says \"Offroad.\"\n\nAlthough Dodge introduced a new Ram 1500 for 2002, the old second-generation style Ram was carried over for the 2002 model year heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 trucks. The new third-generation Ram would not appear in the 2500/3500 variants until 2003. Part of this delay was due to the then new 5.7&nbsp;L Hemi engine not being ready for production.\n\n====Mexico====\n{{main|Dodge Ramcharger}}\nUnencumbered by CAFE ([[Corporate average fuel economy]]) restrictions, DaimlerChrysler's Mexican subsidiary developed a three-door wagon version of the Ram, called the [[Dodge Ramcharger|Ram Charger]] as was its predecessor. It first appeared in 1998 but was never available in the United States.<ref name=SS03>{{cite book | ref = SS03 | title = Katalog Samochody \u015awiata 2003 | trans-title = World Car Catalogue 2003 | editor-first = Eligiusz | editor-last = Mazur | publisher = Print Shops Prego - Polska Sp. z o.o. | location = Warsaw, Poland | page = 217 | date = 2002 | issn = 1234-8198 }}</ref>\n\n===Drivetrain===\n\n====Transmissions====\nTransmissions for the Ram\n*[[TorqueFlite|A500/42RH-RE]] lower geared light duty applications found behind the 3.9 L V6\n*[[TorqueFlite|A518/46RH-RE]] for more heavy duty applications found behind the 5.2 L and 5.9 L V8 engines.\n*[[TorqueFlite|A618/47RH-RE]] for heavy duty use behind the V10 gasoline and Cummins diesel engines. The 47RH was used in 1994 and 1995 model years, while the 47RE was used from 1996 through 2002.\n[[New Venture Gear 3500 transmission|NV3500]] was offered in 1500 Rams and light-duty 2500 Rams.\n[[New Venture Gear 4500 transmission|NV4500]] was standard in 2500 and 3500 trucks; the NV4500HD for V10 and diesel models (''except the uncommon, light-duty 2500 rams'').\nA [[New Venture Gear 5600 transmission|NV5600]] was offered in 1999 and 2000 Rams and was the only transmission offered behind the High Output diesel in 2001 and 2002.\n\n====Transfer cases====\nThere were a total of five [[transfer case]]s available for the four-wheel-drive Ram. All are part-time and have a low range of 2.72:1. The 1500 featured a NP231 and NP231HD. The NP241 was standard on V8 2500 Rams. The 2500 and 3500 V10 and diesel featured a NP241DLD from 1993 to 1997. In 1997 the NP241DHD became an option for 2500 Rams and was standard on 3500 Rams from 1998 to 2002.\n\n====Axles====\nThe Dodge Ram features a wide variety of axles. For the front axle of 4x4 Rams, a [[Dana 44]] was used on all 1500 Rams and the early (light-duty) 2500 Rams. However, most of the 2500 and all 3500 Rams use [[Dana 60]] front axles. The 1500 Rams and some early light duty 2500 Rams used a 9.25 Chrysler (Spicer) axle in the rear. A [[Dana 60]] rear axle was used on heavy duty 2500 V8 Rams. A [[Dana 70]] rear axle was used in 2500 Rams with a V10 or a Diesel/Automatic transmission combination. A [[Dana 80]] rear axle was used on 2500 Rams with a manual transmission and V10/diesel engine combination. Every 3500 Ram was made with a Dana 80. The front drive axles in these Rams were unique in the fact they did not have [[locking hubs]], but featured a [[center axle disconnect]]. The 2002 2500 and 3500 Rams saw the eventual phase out of the Center axle disconnect, in favor of front axles that were permanently locked in. Dodge continued to include front axles like this for their 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 trucks until 2013 models.\n\n===Engines===\nA [[natural gas|natural-gas-powered]] engine debuted for 1995 but was not popular and was only used in fleet vehicles on a very limited production run. The [[Cummins B Series engine]] was switched from the 12-valve to the 24-valve (ISB) version in the middle of the 1998 model-year Dodge Rams due to emissions regulations. The ISB featured a new computer-controlled electronic injection pump and 24-valve head design.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n!8th VIN\n|-\n|{{nowrap|1994\u20132001}}||{{convert|239|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 3.9L|Magnum]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||{{convert|175|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|225|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}|| X\n|-\n|1994\u20132001||{{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.2|Magnum]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]||{{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>|| Y\n|-\n|1995\u20131997||{{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} Natural Gas V8 ||{{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|430|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||\n|-\n|1994\u20131997||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|325|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||Z (5 for the heavy-duty version)\n|-\n|1998\u20132002||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|245|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|335|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||Z (5 for the heavy-duty version)\n|-\n|1994\u20132002||{{convert|488|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref>[http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/attachments/08192002_VIPER_OVERVIEW.pdf Chapter 3 for 2003: Dodge Viper SRT-10] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320113521/http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/attachments/08192002_VIPER_OVERVIEW.pdf |date=March 20, 2009 }}.

It included longitudinal stripes similar to those on the Dodge Viper along with an optional door sticker stating \"Official Truck of the 80th Indianapolis 500\". These trucks had a {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine with upgraded exhaust and {{convert|15|hp|abbr=on}} more power. These also included {{convert|17|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheels with Goodyear Eagle II 275/60R-17 tires. The SS/T (Super Sport Truck) version was available from 1997 to 1998 and included all the same upgrades except the door sticker. The SS/T also had \"SS/T\" designed into the stripe on both the hood and tailgate. The Indy Trucks were available only in blue with white stripes. The SS/Ts were available in white/blue, red/silver, black/silver, and green/silver. All include a specialty sticker on the inner door stating, \"Built with pride in the U.S.A.\" A real Pace truck is a metal plate on the driver's side frame rail, with a raised number 19 on it.

This was a major update including an all new frame, suspension, powertrains, interiors, and sheet metal. The crew cab models for this generation were actually Quad Cab trucks that had conventional-opening rear doors. The four-wheel-drive light trucks (1500 series) lost their [[live axle]]s in favor of an [[independent suspension|independent front suspension]], but the 2500 and 3500 series retained the live axles for maximum longevity and durability; rear-wheel-drive 2500 & 3500 had class-exclusive rack and pinion steering for their independent front suspension (the 1500 also received rack and pinion steering for the first time). This body style drew heavily from the previous generation.\n\nThe redesigned trucks bolstered sales, with 400,000 sold during 2001-2002 and nearly 450,000 sold during 2002-2003, a new high point for the Ram name. At the same time, both [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks were increasing in sales from a 2001 peak over 850,000 to the 900,000 range. But with 400,543 Rams sold that year, the Ram's sales could not keep up with the eleventh-generation [[Ford F-Series eleventh generation|F-150]] in 2004.\n\n===2006 Facelift===\n\n[[File:2006-2008 Dodge Ram 1500 -- 03-16-2012.JPG|thumb|left|2006\u20132008 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab]]\n\nThe Dodge Ram was updated for the 2006 model year. One notable addition was the \"Mega Cab\", featuring a {{convert|6.25|ft|m|0|adj=on}} cargo box and {{convert|22|in|0|abbr=}} of extra cab space, allowing seating for six with rear recliners, a full screen mapping in-dash navigation system became an option, and the [[headlamp]]s were redesigned to a more modern design.\n\nFor 2006, the [[steering wheel]] design was changed to one from the [[Dodge Dakota]] and [[Dodge Durango]]. [[Bluetooth]] [[U Connect]] was now available as an option, and a front facelift was given to all Ram models. [[SIRIUS Satellite Radio]] was available, as well was a rear seat [[DVD]] entertainment system with wireless [[headphones]]. The [[Street and Racing Technology|SRT]] model, with the 8.3&nbsp;L [[V10 engine]] from the [[Dodge Viper]] SRT/10, was discontinued after the 2006 [[model year]].\n\nFor 2007, Dodge changed the tail lights.\n\n===Chassis Cab===\nIn 2007, a 3500 Chassis Cab model was introduced with industry-standard rear frame width and wiring to accommodate outfitters. In addition to the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}, a [[Cummins]] {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[diesel engine|diesel]] rated at {{convert|350|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|650|lbft|0|abbr=on}} was also available. Automatic transmissions used were the [[Chrysler RFE transmission|545RFE]] with the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} and the [[List of Aisin transmissions|AS68RC]] with the {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}. The G56 transmission was the only manual transmission offered.\n\nFor 2008, Dodge introduced two more Chassis Cab models, the 4500 and 5500. These were [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class-4]] and [[Truck classification#Class 5|Class-5]] trucks with a gross weight of {{convert|16500|lb|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19500|lb|0|abbr=on}}, respectively. Both trucks came equipped with the same version of the [[Cummins]] {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[diesel engine|diesel]] as the 3500 chassis-cab model. [[Sterling Trucks|Sterling]], who worked with Dodge in development, had their own version, called the [[Sterling Bullet]] with a unique grille. Sterling is a division of [[Freightliner LLC]] which, like Dodge, was owned by the former [[DaimlerChrysler]]. [[Sterling Trucks]] was licensed to sell Dodge Ram 4500 series trucks as the Sterling Bullet. When the [[Sterling Trucks|Sterling]] brand was phased out by [[Chrysler Corporation]], the Bullet was discontinued.\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Model\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n|-\n|rowspan=5|1500||2002-2008||{{convert|226|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler PowerTech engine#3.7 EKG|Magnum]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||{{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|235|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|2002-2007||{{convert|287|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Magnum'' V8 ||{{convert|235|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|2008-2013||{{convert|287|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Magnum'' V8 ||{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=semihemi>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/47.html| title = The 4.7 Liter \"Next Generation\" and \"semi-Hemi\" V8 Engine (Dodge ) | work = Allpar.com: Trucks | publisher = Allpar LLC | first = Rick | last = Ehrenberg | accessdate = 2014-03-15 }}</ref>||{{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=semihemi/>\n|-\n|2002-2003||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|245|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|335|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|2003-2008||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine#New Hemi|Hemi]]'' V8 ||{{convert|345|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|375|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |2500/3500\n|2009||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8 ||{{convert|390|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002-2003 SO \"6\" Vin Designation||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Cummins B Series engine#ISB|Cummins]]'' [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]||{{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002\u20132003 SO California Emissions||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|235|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}||{{convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002-2004 HO \"C\" Vin Designation||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6||{{convert|305|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}||{{convert|555|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2004.5-2007 HO||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|325|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}||{{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2007-2009||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|650|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002-2003||{{convert|488|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Magnum V10|Magnum]]'' [[V10 engine|V10]]||{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|450|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Chassis Cab\n|2008\u20132009||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine#New Hemi|Hemi]]'' V8 (3500 Only)||{{convert|345|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|375|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2009||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8 (3500 Only)||{{convert|388|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|404|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2008\u20132009||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|SRT-10||2004-2006||{{convert|505|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Viper engine#Second generation|Viper]]'' [[V10 engine|V10]]||{{convert|510|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|535|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\nModels built after January 1, 2007 offered a new 6.7 L Cummins turbo diesel introduced as an option in 2500/3500 models replacing the 5.9 L.

This engine featured the same performance but had a cylinder-deactivating feature enabled under light loads to increase fuel economy by 3 MPG city and 4 MPG hwy. This new Hemi still delivered {{convert|345|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|375|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}.\n\n===Axles===\nFor the 2003 model year, AAM axles replaced the Dana Corp axles. In the front all 2500 and 3500 trucks were 9.25-inch with 33 spline axles. The rear options for the 2500 and 3500 were the AAM (often referred to as \"corporate\") [[10.5\" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#10.5 AAM|10.5]]\" and [[10.5\" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#11.5 AAM|11.5]]\". Rear axle shafts are 30 spline. The rear 11.5\" has a gear ratio \"carrier split\" at 3.73 and numerically higher, but the General Motors AAM axles used a different carrier spacing preventing installation of a Chrysler carrier into some GM axles, but the GM carrier can be installed in the Chrysler axle if a ring gear spacer is installed. Strength is similar to their earlier Dana 70 and 80 counterparts. Direct comparisons are difficult as the axles are made with completely different [[metallurgy]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:3rd Gen.jpg|2003 Dodge Ram diesel dually quad cab 2wd with the 5.9L Cummins Turbodiesel I6\nFile:2002-05 Dodge Ram.jpg|2005 Dodge Ram 1500 quad cab with the 5.7L Hemi V8\nFile:Dodge-Ram-Mega-Cab.jpg|Dodge Ram 2500 Mega Cab\nFile:Sterling Bullet.jpg|Sterling Bullet, a version of the Ram sold by [[Sterling Trucks]] with the 6.7L Cummins Diesel I6\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Special editions===\n* '''HemiSport''' - The HemiSport Edition was the Quad Cab version of the Rumble Bee, and was introduced in 2004.

It was available only on regular-cab/short-box pickups; however, some other versions of the Ram were modified to look like Rumble Bees. It includes lower body cladding, 20\" wheels, a hood scoop, and an SLT interior specially trimmed with yellow dashboard and door panel inserts and a serialized number plate. On the rear of the box is a stripe with a \"Rumble Bee\" emblem, similar to that of the [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]]. All Rumble Bees are either black with \"solar yellow\" trim or yellow with black trim.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} 4,858 were produced in 2004, and 5,174 in 2005.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n* '''HemiGTX''' - The Hemi GTX package is a limited sport-truck version of the Ram. Introduced in 2004 and only made in 2004 and 2005, these were customized by LA West of Indiana as ordered from dealers, adding an additional $8,300.50 in sticker price. It was available on regular-cab/short-box and quad-cab/short-box pickups and include a custom overall paint from Mopar's Impact colors from the 1970s (this includes Hemi Orange, Plum Crazy Purple, Sublime Green, and Banana Yellow). 20\" American Racing Motto chrome wheels, a new cowl \"blacked-out\" hood, and a specially trimmed leather 2-tone interior including a serialized number plate on the driver's-side doorjamb were offered. On the sides is a \"hockey-stick\" stripe with \"HEMI GTX\" that extended from the hood to the rear of the box. The air box was also painted to match the body color, and a color-matched steering wheel was added as well. They were only 433 produced in 2004 and roughly the same number in 2005. A certificate of authenticity was given to all original owners.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n[[File:'02-'05 Dodge Ram Daytona Crew Cab 1500.JPG|thumb|2005 Dodge Ram Daytona]]\n* '''Daytona''' - Introduced for 2005, the Ram Daytona was a new sport-truck edition of the Ram. It was available as a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 in Regular or Quad-Cab styles and featured lower-body cladding, 20-inch chrome wheels, SRT-10 hood, Borla dual exhaust, serialized number plate, and a tall rear spoiler reminiscent of the 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]]. The Daytonas had a black body stripe to match the rear spoiler and came in silver or \"Go Mango\" paint (a metallic orange color reminiscent of the Dodge's \"high impact\" colors from the 1960s and 1970s) with matching interior trim. The Dodge Ram Daytona had a 3.92 ratio rear end, the same rear end as the Dodge Ram Rumble Bee. Several exterior items were unique to the Daytona package (such as the gas door and dual side exit exhaust tips) which made it different from other equipment packages. It was equipped with {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} [[chrome plating|chrome]] wheels and performance tires. Replacing the standard hood is one with a non-functional [[hood scoop]]. The most noticeable feature is the large [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] which is attached at the rear of the cargo box. The {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} spoiler lined up with the flat black stripe that ran along the back of the bed side with the word 'Daytona' written in the middle. This spoiler is reminiscent of the 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n*'''Contractor's Special hybrid''' - Dodge announced a [[hybrid car|hybrid]] version of the Ram, dubbed the ''Contractor's Special'', in 2003. However, the schedule for delivery slipped as Dodge backed away from the vehicle. The hybrid Ram was available only for fleet purchasers (if at all) and did not enter mass production. It offered an [[alternating current|AC]] electrical outlet panel for running an entire job site worth of power tools, but the through-the-road method of balancing the gas engine and electric motor reportedly did not work as desired. Dodge has announced that it would use a hybrid transmission developed jointly with [[General Motors]] and [[BMW]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/ram/special-rams.html |title=Specialty Dodge Rams |work=Allpar |accessdate=2010-11-22}}</ref>\n*'''NightRunner''' - 400 of these were assembled from January 2006 to December 2006 (200 Single-cab and 200 Quad-cab).

This is because the competitors stopped making manual transmissions available in the domestic market. [[Chevrolet Silverado]] trucks discontinued the option of a manual transmission after model year 2006. [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks discontinued the option of a manual transmission after model year 2010. This applies to [[Truck classification#Class 2|Class 2]], [[Truck classification#Class 3|Class 3]], [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class 4]] and [[Truck classification#Class 5|Class 5]] trucks. 2011 and 2012 models make {{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

The 3500 Heavy Duty model was unveiled at the 2009 [[Chicago Auto Show]].\n\nEngine choices include 5.7&nbsp;L Hemi V8 rated at {{convert|383|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|542|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm for Ram 3500, 6.7 l Cummins turbo diesel rated at {{convert|350|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 3,013 rpm and {{convert|880|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 1,500 rpm for Ram 3500 (optional), 4500, 5500. Late-model 2011 diesel trucks were up-rated to {{convert|800|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.\n\nTransmission choices included a standard 6-speed manual or optional 6-speed [[Aisin]] automatic. Both transmissions support the Power Takeoff option.\n\nThe 3500 model has regular or crew cab, single-rear-wheel or dual-rear-wheel. Four cab-axle lengths (60, 84, 108 and 120&nbsp;inches) for 4500/5500 or two cab-axle lengths (60 and 84&nbsp;inches) for 3500, and three trim levels (ST, SLT and Laramie).\n\nThe Ram 3500 has three axle ratios (3.42, 3.73 and 4.10) and 17-inch wheels. Ram 4500/5500 has three axle ratios (4.10, 4.44 and 4.88) and 19.5-inch wheels. The 4500/5500 Rams rear axle is a [[Dana S 110]]. The front axle on 4x4 models is manufactured by [[Magna International|Magna]], while 2-wheel-drive models just have a solid, non-drive axle.\n\n====Concept truck====\nThe Ram concept truck \"Long Hauler\" from 2012 is based mostly on existing Ram truck parts. The powertrain, frame and wheels are all components of the Ram 5500 Chassis Cab. It is a \"Mega Cab\" optional on the lighter Rams. The [[Gross combined weight rating|GCWR]] for this truck is 37,500&nbsp;lb and the weight of the truck is 9,300&nbsp;lb.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/concepts/ram/long-hauler.html|title=Long Hauler |accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2013 changes===\n[[File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 01 China 2014-04-24.jpg|thumb|2013 Ram 1500]]\n[[File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 02 China 2014-04-24.jpg|thumb|2013 Ram 1500]]\n\nThe 1500 gets a minor restyling. It features new front fascia, optional projector beam halogen headlamps with [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] turn signals/parking lamps, wheels and interior, where the \"DODGE\" name was removed from the dashboard and replaced with \"RAM\".\n\nAll models offered for 2012 continue to be available for 2013 with the addition of a new trim, the Laramie, Longhorn, Limited. (Tradesman, Express, SLT, Big Horn, Lone Star, Sport, R/T, Laramie, and Laramie Longhorn). The Rambox cargo management system continues to be available on most models for 2013. For 2013, the base ST model becomes the Tradesman model.\n\n2013 models have revised engine and transmission options. The 3.7&nbsp;L V6 is discontinued, and the 4.7&nbsp;L V8 equipped with the 6-speed 65RFE Automatic takes its place as the new base engine, still producing {{convert|310|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. New to the lineup is Chrysler's corporate 3.6&nbsp;L Pentastar V6, coupled to the new [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 8-speed Torqueflite8 Automatic. It achieves best in class fuel efficiency and makes {{convert|305|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|269|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}. The Pentastar/ZF 8-speed is optional. Due to a new electric power steering system, the 5.7&nbsp;L HEMI V8 no longer has a power steering pump, and gains 5 horsepower, now making {{convert|395|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. It is still available with the 65RFE 6-speed Automatic, with the new 8-speed Torqueflite8 Automatic optional.\n\n[[Air suspension]] is optional for 2013 models, offering four ride height settings. [[Electronic stability control]] becomes standard on 2500 and 3500 models. For 2013, the Ram is also the first North American pickup truck to offer [[Smart key|keyless ignition]].\n\nNew infotainment systems are available for the RAM 1500 for 2013:\n\nThe base U Connect 3.0 (RA1) radio includes an AM/FM radio, Radio Data System (RDS), a monochrome LCD display screen, a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack, and a single USB port for charging purposes only.\n\nThe \"up-level\" U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) radio adds a full-color, 5.0-inch color touch-screen display, voice control for phone, a microSD card slot, Bluetooth for phone and A2DP wireless stereo audio streaming capabilities, and vehicle customization options on-screen.\n\nThe \"top-of-the-line\" radios are the U Connect ACCESS 8.4A (RA3) and U Connect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4). These radios add a full-color, 8.4-inch color touch-screen display, full voice control, [[SiriusXM]] satellite radio, the U Connect ACCESS System, featuring roadside assistance and 9-1-1 emergency call buttons on the rear-view mirror, mobile app compatibility, remote USB ports for integration of compatible devices, enhanced in-vehicle customization options, automatic notification of airbag deployment, concierge services, remote control via an app installed on a compatible [[smartphone]], and the ability to add GPS navigation from [[Garmin]] for vehicles not equipped with the option from the factory (it is activated by a dealership for a fee, however, does not include SiriusXM Travel Link or 3D mapping). The U Connect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4) adds GPS navigation from Garmin, [[HD Radio]] SiriusXM Travel Link, 3D mapping, and enhanced mobile app compatibility. The system also includes a built-in [[3G]] internet router, allowing for wireless connection to the internet while the vehicle is parked with a monthly service subscription. The system can also be updated to add additional features that will be available in the future via a USB stick inserted into one of the remote USB ports. Remote steering wheel-mounted controls are also included with this system.\n\nOptions such as a CD Player (mounted in the center console of the vehicle), SiriusXM satellite radio  and a Rearview Backup Camera can be added to any radio.\n\n====3500====\nThe 2013 models move up to an 18-inch standard wheel, with 18-inch [[Forging|forged]] [[Alcoa]] wheels as an option. 3500 models offer a High Output package for the diesel. The rear [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] ring gear is increased from 11.5 inches, to 11.8 inches on H.O. trucks. The 11.8 axle cover doubles as a [[heat sink]].\n\n====4x4====\nRam, once again, put the [[Center axle disconnect]] in 3500 4x4 models. 2500 Ram trucks did not have a CAD system until 2014 models. Ram claims this technology to improve fuel efficiency by 1 MPG, although [[EPA]] tests do not include class 2 and class 3 trucks in the [[Miles per gallon|MPG]]/fuel efficiency tests. The 4x4 saw additional changes with the [[transfer case]] now being made by [[BorgWarner]] instead of [[New Venture Gear]].\n\n====High Fuel Efficiency====\nA new model offered for the 2013 Ram is the HFE (High Fuel Efficiency). Based on the SLT model, the HFE offers 18/25 [[Miles per gallon|MPG]] out of its [[Pentastar]] V6 engine and eight-speed [[ZF 8HP transmission|Torque-Flite]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], which has nothing in common with the original Chrysler built [[TorqueFlite]]. It is available only in the six-foot bed, two-door, regular cab model with two-wheel-drive only. Standard features include a 220 amp [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|alternator]] and an 800 amp battery to assist with the [[Start-stop system]]. 3.21:1 axle gearing is also standard.\n\n===2014 changes===\n[[File:2014RAM3500.jpg|thumb|2014 Ram 3500 crew cab, 4\u00d74, DRW]]\nThe option of [[air suspension]] became available on the rear of 2014 model year 2500 and 3500 pick up trucks. 1500 models added the option of an [[List of VM Motori engines#A 630 DOHC|Eco-Diesel V6]]. 2500 models now feature coil spring suspension, instead of leaf spring. The cast iron, flex fuel, 4.7 V8 [[Chrysler PowerTech engine]] was discontinued, ending Corsair engine production, leaving the Ram 1500 with two engine choices. The aluminum, flex fuel 3.6 V6 [[Pentastar]] is now the base engine, along with the 8-speed [[ZF 8HP transmission|Torque-Flite]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. The 3.6&nbsp;L Pentastar V6 was available on Laramie and Longhorn trims.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Mark|title=Ram Will Offer Pentastar V6 in Top Trim Levels|url= http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2014/03/ram-will-offer-pentastar-v-6-in-top-trim-levels.html |work=pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref> The Ram heavy-duty series of trucks (2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500) received a new interior design and revised exterior styling from the Ram 1500, which was restyled in 2013.\n\n===2016 changes===\n[[File:Rebel1.jpg|thumb|2016 Ram Rebel]]\nFor 2016, the all-new Ram 1500 '''Rebel''' debuted, offering off-road suspension with a {{convert|1.0|in|cm|1}} higher ride height, larger tires, and a unique interior to add to the Ram 1500 '''Big Horn''' and '''Lone Star''' trim levels.

This was previously a $495.00 option on the Ram '''SLT'''.\n\n===2017 changes===\nFor 2017, the Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn and Limited trims received the new RAM front grille and \"RAM\" emblem across the rear tailgate that debuted on the 2016 RAM 1500 Rebel.\n\nIn mid-2017, the RAM 1500's 3.0&nbsp;L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbodiesel engine, produced by [[VM Motori]], was dropped in mid-2017 in response to emissions cheating allegations. The engine will be re-introduced in early 2018, as re-certification by the [[EPA]] has been obtained.\n\nThe 1500 SLT model loses the U Connect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) option, leaving the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) radio as the only radio option. However. all Ram heavy-duty (2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500) SLT models will still offer the U Connect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) as an option.\n\nThe Rebel trim level of the Ram 1500 gains the previously-optional U Connect ACCESS 8.4A infotainment system as standard equipment, as do the Big Horn and Lone Star trim levels. A Rebel Black Edition Package is available that adds black accents to the Rebel.\n\nThe Laramie trim level of the Ram 1500, 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 gets a standard nine-speaker, 506-watt [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] 7.1-channel surround-sound premium audio system as standard equipment.\n\nThree new special edition trim levels debut for 2017 for the Ram 1500 model:\n\n* The Lone Star Silver Edition, available exclusively at Ram dealerships in [[Texas]] and based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, adds additional chrome trim pieces to the trim level. It debuted at the 2016 [[Texas State Fair]].\n* The Lone Star Yellow Rose Edition, also available exclusively at Ram dealerships in Texas and also based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, is available only in a model-exclusive Stinger Yellow Clear Coat exterior paint color. It debuted at the 2016 Texas State Fair.\n* The Night Edition, available at Ram dealerships nationwide, is based on the Sport trim level, and adds black-finished emblems, twenty-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, front grille, door handles, and emblems to the model.\n\nThere is also a new Off-Road Package available for all Ram 2500 models (aside from the Power Wagon trim level, which includes the package as standard equipment), and includes unique pickup bedside graphics, off-road suspension, front tow hooks, and the protection package.\n\nThe mid-level SLT trim level of the RAM 1500 is no longer available to retail customers, as it is now a lesser-equipped model reserved exclusively for fleet customers. However, the SLT trim level still remains for the Ram 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 models, and are still available to retail customers. However, retail customers wanting SLT features such as chrome front and rear bumpers and front grille, seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, power windows and door locks with keyless entry, the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, cloth seating surfaces, [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]], a rear-view backup camera system, and floor carpeting, can still opt for the Chrome Appearance and Popular Equipment Packages on the Tradesman model.\n\nFor customers wanting a less expensive [[Bluetooth]] option for the Ram truck, a new U Connect 3.0BT (RA2) radio is available for an additional $200.00, which includes an A/M-F/M radio and SiriusXM Satellite Radio tuner, Radio Data System (RDS), U Connect Bluetooth hands-free phone system with audio streaming and voice command, steering wheel-mounted remote voice command controls, a USB port and 3.5&nbsp;mm auxiliary audio input jack, and a three-inch (3.0\") monochrome LCD display screen. This radio option is available for the Tradesman trim level of all Ram trucks, and the Express trim level of the Ram 1500, and is included as part of a Popular Equipment Package on the latter model. Previously, customers wanting Bluetooth on a Ram Tradesman or Ram 1500 Express would have to upgrade to the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, which would add the same features as described above, as well as onscreen vehicle customization via the radio, and a full five-inch (5.0\") color touch-screen display, and cost an additional $495.00. In order to do this, the customer would also have to select the Popular Equipment Package on both models.\n\nThe RAM 2500 Power Wagon returned with a 6.4&nbsp;L [[HEMI]] gasoline V8 engine, a unique graphics package (delete option), black front grille, door handles, larger tires and black aluminum-alloy wheels, and the Off-Road Package. The Power Wagon Package is also available for the Ram 2500 Tradesman trim level, and also adds the 6.4L HEMI gasoline V8 engine.\n\n===2018 changes===\nChanges to the Ram for 2018 included the addition of [[HD Radio]] to all U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems, as well as a new [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] wireless hot-spot provided by [[AT&T Wireless]], an AT&T Wireless 4G LTE in-vehicle modem (both the AT&T Wireless 4G LTE modem and 4G LTE mobile hot-spot replace the [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] [[3G]] [[CDMA]] modem and 3G CDMA mobile hot-spot offered on previous Ram models), [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] smartphone integration for the U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems, and the SiriusXM Guardian service replacing the U Connect ACCESS service offered on previous RAM models for the U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems. In addition, all U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems get a new [[User Interface]] design for easier navigation of menus and applications.\n\nThe [[VM Motori]]-produced 3.0&nbsp;L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbodiesel engine returned in early 2018 for the RAM 1500, as it has been re-certified by the [[EPA]] after allegations of emissions cheating in 2017.\n\nMost upper trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Sport, Rebel, Laramie Longhorn, and Limited) get the new RAM front grille introduced for 2016, as well as a large 'RAM' emblem on the rear tailgate. Lower to mid trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Tradesman, Express, Big Horn, Lone Star, and Laramie) retain the standard RAM \"Cross-Hair\" front grille.\n\nThe Night Edition and Lone Star Silver Edition trim levels were continued.\n\nFor 2018, there are two new special editions:\n* The Harvest Edition (also available on the Ram 2500 and 3500), are based on the Big Horn and Lone Star models. Available in only four paint colors, two of which are unique to the Harvest Edition (Case IH Red, New Holland Blue, two-tone Black Clear Coat and Bright Silver Metallic, or Bright White Clear Coat). Aimed at farmers, the Harvest Edition adds features that are otherwise optional on the Big Horn and Lone Star, such as seventeen-inch chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels with all-terrain tires on 4X4 models, the U Connect 8.4 infotainment system with GPS navigation, [[SiriusXM]] Travel Link with five years of service included and one year of SiriusXM Guardian service, a trailer tow package with integrated trailer brake control, rear-mounted tow hitch, and trailer tow side mirrors. Also included are front bucket seats with power front driver's seat trimmed in premium cloth, chrome side steps, chrome side mirror covers, chrome door handles, and chrome front tow hooks. It is available as either a Quad Cab or a Crew Cab.\n* The Laramie Longhorn Southfork Edition Package, available on 1500, 2500, and 3500 Laramie Longhorn models, adds even more luxury features to the already luxurious truck, such as unique twenty-inch polished aluminum-alloy wheels, unique real wood interior trim, and a unique two-tone blue-and-beige interior color scheme.\n\n===2019 changes===\n\nFor 2019, the current fourth-generation Ram 1500 will be sold alongside its successor, the fifth-generation Ram 1500.

All 109 Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrids and 23 [[Chrysler Town & Country#Town & Country Plug-in hybrid|Chrysler Town & Country plug-in hybrid]]s deployed by the program were recalled due to damage sustained by three separate pickup trucks when their 12.9 [[kWh]] battery packs overheated. The carmaker plans to upgrade the battery packs with cells that use a different lithium-ion chemistry before the vehicles go back into service. Chrysler explained that no one was injured from any of the incidents, and the vehicles were not occupied at the time, nor any of the minivans were involved in any incident, but they were withdrawn as a precaution. The demonstration is a program jointly funded by Chrysler and the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] that includes the first-ever factory-produced vehicles capable of reverse power flow. The experimental system would allow fleet operators to use their plug-in hybrids to supply electricity for a building during a power outage, reduce power usage when electric rates are high or even sell electricity back to their utility company.<ref name=Chrysler>{{cite web|url= http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1079368_chrysler-yanks-plug-in-hybrid-test-fleet-off-roads-will-replace-batteries|title=Chrysler Yanks Plug-In Hybrid Test Fleet Off Roads, Will Replace Batteries|first=John |last=Voelcker |publisher=Green Car Reports |date=2012-09-24|accessdate=2012-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120924/AUTO0101/209240429 |title=Chrysler halts tests on plug-in hybrid fleet after batteries overheat |first=Bryce G. |last=Hoffman |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=2012-09-24 |accessdate=2012-09-30 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The company reported that the demonstration fleet had collectively accumulated 1.3 million miles (2.1 million km) before the vehicles were recalled.

Germany and Scandinavian countries are some of the largest European markets for the Ram. A thriving cottage industry in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom has imported and converted Ram trucks to right-hand-drive and to meet the local regulations, being more common in Australia since LHD cars less than 30 years old (or 15 years old if registered in Western Australia) cannot be legally driven on Australian public roads unless they are granted a diplomatic or a research and development exception to the rule. In the United Kingdom there is no such restriction, so a stock LHD Ram (or any other LHD vehicle) is not required to undergo the costly and time-consuming process of an RHD conversion in order to be compliant with EU regulations.\n\n===Gray import gallery===\n{{gallery\n|File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 2 China 2014-04-24.jpg|2014 Ram 1500 Crew Cab in [[China]]\n|File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift China 2014-04-24.jpg|Ram 1500 in China\n|File:Ram truck parked at the Palac Kultury I Nauki - Warsaw.jpg|Dodge Ram 3500 in [[Warsaw, Poland]]\n}}\n\n===Nissan Titan===\nFollowing the collapse of [[Nissan Titan]] sales in 2008, there were talks<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/news/nissan/titan/chryslertitan2.html |title=Chrysler Will Make Full Size Light Duty Truck for Nissan\n|first=Mike |last=Levine |publisher=Cars.com|date=April 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2012 }}</ref> that the next generation of Nissan's full-sized pickup would be outsourced to Chrysler as a version of the Ram 1500.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090511/OEM02/305119805 |title=Nissan exec: Pickup deal is too good to drop |first=Lindsay |last=Chappell |journal=Automotive News |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2012 }}</ref> Nissan had been planning to phase out Titan production in its Canton, Mississippi factory in 2010 with the new Nissan-only design for a cab, body and interior riding on the Dodge Ram chassis assembled in Chrysler's truck assembly lines in Saltillo, Mexico.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nissan prepares for key line changes |date=August 11, 2008 |first=Lindsay |last=Chappell |journal=Automotive News |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20080811/OEM04/308119976 |accessdate=April 1, 2012 }}</ref> However, the deal to build Nissan Titan pickups off the full-sized Dodge Ram pickup starting in 2011 was delayed with the changes at Chrysler and Fiat.<ref>{{cite journal |title=As Chrysler ponders building next Titan, Nissan seeks Plan B |date=August 24, 2009 |first=Lindsay |last=Chappell |journal=Automotive News |url= http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090824/GLOBAL02/308249869 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> Nissan eventually decided to keep the Titan,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100118/RETAIL/301189991/1316/mobile01&template=art4 |title=Nissan Titan still has a future |first=Rick |last=Kranz |date=January 18, 2010 |newspaper=Automotive News|accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> and went on to release the second generation Titan as a 2016 model called the Titan XD.\n\n==Special Edition Rams==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2010}}\n\n*'''Express''' - The Express is a Dodge Ram 1500 that offered special badges, 20\" tires and wheels from the Dodge Ram 1500 SLT, cloth seating surfaces, and a 5.7L HEMI V8 engine.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n*'''2012 Detroit Red Wings Edition''' - The Detroit Red Wings Edition is a Crew Cab model with 4x4, special Red Wings seats and \"Detroit Red Wings Edition\" decals (on both sides of the box and on the lower left of the tailgate).

The name ''Ram'' was first used in 1981 Dodge Trucks following the retiring and rebadging of the [[Dodge D Series]] pickup trucks as well as B-series vans, though the company had used a ram's-head hood ornament on some trucks as early as 1933.<ref name=\"ED-DRG\" />\n\nRam trucks have been named ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year| Truck of the Year]] seven times; the second-generation Ram won the award in 1994, the third-generation Ram ''Heavy Duty'' won the award in 2003, the fourth-generation Ram Heavy Duty won in 2010 and the fourth-generation Ram 1500 won in 2013 and 2014, and the current [[Ram Pickup (fifth generation)|fifth-generation]] Ram 1500 won in 2019 and 2020. \n \n{{TOC left}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==First generation (1981; D/W)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = 89DodgeRam F34.jpg\n| caption = 1989 Ram D100\n| production = 1981\u20131993\n| platform = [[Chrysler AD platform]]\n| body_style = 2-door pickup truck<br />2-door extended cab pickup truck<br />4-door crew cab pickup truck\n| wheelbase = Regular cab/6.5' bed:<br />{{convert|115|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Regular cab/8' bed:<br />{{convert|131|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Club Cab/6.5' bed:<br />{{convert|133|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Club Cab/8' bed:<br />{{convert|149|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Crew cab/8' bed:<br />{{convert|165|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n| length = {{convert|190.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} <br /> {{convert|210.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|79.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|76|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />{{convert|73|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| engine = {{convert|225|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine#225|slant-6]] [[Straight-6|I6]]<br />{{convert|239|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine#239 V6|LA V6]]<br />{{convert|318|cuin|L|abbr=on}} [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|LA V8]]<br />{{convert|360|cuin|L|abbr=on}} LA V8<br />{{convert|5.9|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Cummins B Series engine#B5.9|Cummins]] [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]\n| transmission = 3- or 4-speed ''[[Torqueflite]]'' automatic<br />4- or 5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n| related = [[Dodge Ramcharger]]\n}}\n\nThe first-generation Ram trucks and vans introduced in 1981 featured a Ram hood ornament first used on Dodge vehicles from 1932 to 1954.<ref name=\"ED-DRG\">{{cite web |title=Dodge Ram - Generations |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=46028 |publisher=Edmunds.com |first=John |last=DiPietro |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080801102809/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D46028 |archivedate=2008-08-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Not all of the first-generation trucks have this ornament and is most commonly seen on [[four-wheel-drive]] models. Dodge kept the previous generation's model designations: \"D\" or ''Ram'' indicated [[two-wheel drive]] while \"W\" or ''Power Ram'' indicated [[four-wheel drive]]. Just like [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], Dodge used 150 to indicate a half-ton truck, 250 for a three-quarter-ton truck, and 350 for a one-ton truck. The truck models were offered in standard cab, \"Club\" extended cab, and crew cab configurations. They also were offered along with {{convert|6.5|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} and {{convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} bed lengths and \"Utiline\" and \"Sweptline\" styled boxes along with standard boxes. Externally, the first-generation Rams were facelifted versions of the previous generation Dodge D-Series pickups introduced in 1972. The new model introduced larger wraparound [[Automotive lighting|tail lamps]], dual rectangular [[headlamp]]s, and squared-off body lines. Engine choices were pared down to the [[Chrysler Slant-6 engine|225 Slant-6]] and [[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|318]] and [[Chrysler LA engine#360 V8|360 V8s]]. The interior was updated and included a new bench seat and a completely new dashboard and instrument cluster with an optional three-pod design - a speedometer in the center, with the two side pods containing an ammeter on the top left, a temperature gauge bottom left, a fuel gauge on the top right and an oil pressure gauge bottom right. Models without the full gauge package had only indicator lights in the place of the temperature and oil pressure gauges. Among the options offered on the Ram were front bumper guards, a sliding rear cab window, air-conditioning, cruise control, tilt steering column, power door locks and windows, AM/FM stereo with cassette tape player, styled road wheels, aluminum turbine-style mag wheels, special paint and stripe packages, two-tone paint, and a plow package for four-wheel-drive models (referred to as the Sno Commander).\n\nThe \"Club Cab\" was dropped from the lineup after 1982, but Dodge kept the tooling and re-introduced nearly a decade later in the 1991 models. The four-door crew cab and Utiline beds were dropped after the 1985 model year, to make room on the assembly line for the upcoming 1987 [[Dodge Dakota]], and were never reintroduced in this generation.\n\nBasic Ram 100 models were reintroduced for 1984, replacing the previous \"Miser\" trim level available on the Ram 150. A \"Ram-Trac\" shift-on-the-fly transfer case was added for the 1985 Power Rams, and both the crew cab and Utiline flared bed were dropped for 1986. In 1988 the Slant-6 engine was replaced by a {{convert|3.9|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Fuel injection|fuel-injected]] [[Chrysler LA engine#239 V6|V6]] engine. The {{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine also received [[electronic fuel injection]] in 1988. Because of a new computer controlled fuel injection, ignition and ABS system, more vehicle information needed to be displayed through any warning or notification lights; so inside the cab where a small compartment was once located on the dash, a new \"message center\" with four small rectangular light spots, contained the [[check engine light]] and other [[Tell-tale (automotive)|tell-tales]] including one for the parking brake and the [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] if the truck was so equipped. The message center later included \"Wait to Start\" and \"Water in Fuel\" lights on diesel models. Diagnostic fault codes were stored in the computer's memory, and cycling the ignition key three times would allow the computer to flash the trouble codes through the check-engine light for diagnosis of some problems.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/fix/80s-codes.html |title=Retrieving fault codes |publisher=Allpar |accessdate=2010-11-22}}</ref> Rear [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] became standard equipment in 1989.\n\nThe Ram 100 model designation was dropped and these models folded back into the 150 range for 1990, due to the introduction and sales success of the [[Dodge Dakota]] pickup. Additionally, the instrument cluster was slightly revised; the [[ammeter]] was replaced by a [[voltmeter]] while maintaining the 3-pod arrangement of the speedometer and gauges. Also in 1990, Dodge reintroduced the Club Cab, equipped with fold-out jump seats for the 1991-1993 models. Entry was made through the passenger or driver's doors, as there were no rear doors for this configuration.\n\nThese trucks, though popular with fleets, sold poorly compared to the [[Ford F-Series]] and the [[Chevrolet C/K|General Motors C/K Trucks]], with just under 100,000 units sold most years of their production. Part of this was due to the dated cab and chassis design which had been in production since 1972, there was no powerful diesel option until 1989, and there was no big-block gas V8 option. Additionally, the interior had been given few updates since 1981.\n\n===Engines & transmissions===\nFor 1989, the 5.9&nbsp;L V8 received throttle-body [[fuel injection]] for a 20&nbsp;hp (15&nbsp;kW) gain. Additionally, Dodge introduced a new [[Torqueflite|overdrive automatic transmission]] for reduced fuel consumption. This light-duty transmission was designated the A500, and was offered with the 3.9&nbsp;L V6 and 5.2&nbsp;L V8. An \"O/D Off\" pushbutton switch to lock out the overdrive 4th gear was added to the message center. The [[TorqueFlite#A727 .2836RH.2F37RH.29|A727 automatic]] saw continued use for some 5.2&nbsp;L engines, all 5.9&nbsp;L engines, and heavy-duty applications.\n\nThe grille was redesigned for 1991 but kept the large rectangular [[headlamp]]s and crossbar appearance. The engines were substantially [[Chrysler LA engine|upgraded]] for 1992 (3.9&nbsp;L and 5.2&nbsp;L) 1993 and 1994 (5.9&nbsp;L) with multi-port fuel injection, new manifolds, and higher-compression cylinder heads for noticeably higher output. These newly-revised engines were marketed under the \"Magnum\" name. A heavy-duty automatic transmission with overdrive called the [[TorqueFlite#A518 .2846RH.2F46RE.29|A518]] was offered with the 5.2&nbsp;L and 5.9&nbsp;L engines. As part of Chrysler's overhaul of corporate transmission nomenclature, the A500 and A518 were redesignated 42RH and 46RH, respectively, in 1992. The initial \"4\" signified a 4-speed transmission, the second digit identified the transmission's relative torque capacity, the letter \"R\" in the third position denoted a rear-wheel-drive transmission, and the final letter \"H\" signified hydraulic shift control. The 3-speed automatic remained available; the A727 was redesignated 36RH, and the A904, A998, and A999 became the 30RH, 31RH, and 32RH, respectively.\n\n====5.9 Cummins====\n[[File:1993 Dodge Ram W250 Club Cab 4x4 Cummins td.jpg|thumb|1993 W250 Club Cab]]\nA [[Cummins B Series engine]] was also added to the engine lineup in 1989.<ref name=\"AllparCummins\">{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/cummins-diesel.html |title=Cummins 5.9-liter and 6.7-liter inline six-cylinder diesel engines |publisher=Allpar.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-24}}</ref> For the first time, Dodge saw sales increase. The Cummins was coupled with a heavier-duty version of the [[TorqueFlite#A727|A727 automatic]] or a 5-speed [[manual transmission]] and is available on 250 and 350 pickups and pickup-based chassis-cab trucks. This diesel engine option was different from the optional diesels in Ford and GM trucks. The Cummins features direct injection, whereas the Ford and GM diesels feature [[indirect injection]]; this also means that the Cummins does not have to rely on [[glowplug]]s. The Cummins is a [[straight-six engine]], whereas the GM and Ford diesel engines are V8 engines. Additionally, the Cummins is [[Turbocharger|turbocharged]], while the [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine|6.2&nbsp;L GM/DDC]] and [[International Harvester IDI|7.3 IDI Ford/IH]] are [[naturally aspirated]].<ref name=\"AllparCummins\"/>\n\nPre-1994 Cummins-engined Dodge pickups are often termed a \"First-Gen Cummins\".\n\nThis was not the first engine to appear in Dodge pickup trucks as a diesel option. The 1978 and 1979 D-Series models were available with a Mitsubishi naturally-aspirated diesel, but it was seldom ordered.<ref name=\"AllparCummins\"/>\n\nIn the middle of 1991, Dodge started using 350 frames in Ram 250 diesels, club cabs and crew cabs.<ref>http://1stgen.org/viewtopic.php?t=5143</ref>\n\n====Engines====\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n|-\n|1981\u20131987||{{convert|225|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler Slant 6 engine|Slant-6]]'' [[Straight-six engine|I6]]||{{convert|95|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|170|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|1988\u20131991||{{convert|239|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 3.9L|LA]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||{{convert|125|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|195|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|1992\u20131993||{{convert|239|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 3.9L|Magnum]]'' V6 ||{{convert|175|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|225|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|1981\u20131987||{{convert|318|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|LA]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]||{{convert|140|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|240|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|1988\u20131991||{{convert|318|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#318 V8|LA]]'' V8 ||{{convert|170|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|1992\u20131993||{{convert|318|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.2|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|1981\u20131988||{{convert|360|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#360 V8|LA]]'' V8 ||{{convert|175|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|1989\u20131992||{{convert|360|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#360 V8|LA]]'' V8 ||{{convert|190|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|292|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|1993||{{convert|360|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#cummins 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|325|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|1989\u20131993||{{convert|359\n|cuin|L|abbr=on}} ''[[Cummins B Series engine#B 5.9|Cummins diesel]]'' I6 ||{{convert|160|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|400|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|}\n\n;Gallery\n{{gallery | height = 130\n|File:1983 D150 with SLANT6.jpg|1983 Dodge Ram D150\n|File:89RamIP.jpg|1989 Dodge Ram interior\n|File:Dodge Ram 150 LE -- 11-29-2010 1.jpg|1991\u20131993 Dodge Ram 150, showing facelifted grille\n|File:1991-93 Dodge Ram 250 Club Cab Cummins.jpg|1991-1993 Dodge Ram 250 Club Cab\n}}\n{{clear}}\n\n===Special editions===\n*'''Prospector''' - Prospector was a package available throughout the 1980s that usually included a different fuel tank, cloth seat and carpeting.

That year, it was prominently featured as the hero vehicle in the film ''[[Twister (1996 film)|Twister]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/business/1996/06/01/reels-and-reels-of-wheels/cf2cbd8b-c945-47ac-9c31-3e970910fca7/?noredirect=on |title=Reels and Reels of Wheels |first=Warren |last=Brown |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 1, 1996 |accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.motorious.com/articles/news/315749/twister-replica-dodge-ram-sure-to-kick-up-a-storm-at-auction |title=Twister Replica Dodge Ram Sure To Kick Up A Storm At Auction |first=Tyler |last=Heatley |website=Motorious |date=March 28, 2019 |accessdate=April 20, 2019}}</ref> Sales of this generation peaked at just over 400,000 in 1999 before declining against the redesigned [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks. By 2001, Ram sales figures were below those of Ford and Chevy trucks.\n\nEngine offerings continued over from the first-generation Ram and were the 3.9&nbsp;L V6, 5.2&nbsp;L V8, 5.9&nbsp;L V8, and 5.9&nbsp;L [[Straight-six engine|I6]] Cummins turbo diesel. Added to the line up was a new 488 cubic inch 8.0L V10 engine designed as an alternative for those who wanted superior pulling power but did not want a diesel. The new [[V10 engine|V10]] and Cummins turbo diesel could only be had in the 2500 and higher designation models. Models were now the 1500 half-ton, 2500 three-quarter-ton, and 3500 dual-rear-wheel one-ton in both 2- and 4-wheel drive. 1500 Rams offered both 6.5- and 8-foot (2 and 2.4 m, respectively) boxes. 2500 Rams offered {{convert|6.5|ft|m|adj=on}} boxes with club or quad Cabs.\n\nDodge offered the 2500 series in two different gross-vehicle-weight ratings for the first few years, but this was later dropped. The purpose of the difference between the light-duty and heavy-duty 2500 trucks was for the heavy-duty 2500 to take the place of the discontinued one-ton single-rear-wheel trucks. Rear axles for the light-duty 2500 trucks were [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|semi-floating]], while the heavy-duty 2500 rear axles were [[Axle#Full-floating vs semi-floating|full-floating]].\n\nOn the inside, special attention was paid to in-cab storage features, with a large glovebox, a center armrest storage area, and extra storage space behind the seat. The dash and gauge cluster were a far cry from the previous model Ram and were far more modern as well. A redesign of the dashboard and instrument cluster was introduced in 1998 along with the introduction of the quad cab, and rounded black plastic side-view mirrors replaced the previous rectangular design.\n\n===1998 updates===\nIn 1998, Dodge introduced the \"Quad Cab\", which uses smaller, [[suicide doors]] directly behind the main doors. This was offered as an option on the \"Club Cab\" for this model year. Other changes for 1998 included rounded mirrors replacing the classic square ones, a revised interior, dual airbags, a chime replacing the buzzer for seat belts/door ajar/headlights/ and a digital [[odometer]]. The [[OBD II]] System was also standard, with a computer port near the driver's-side footwell and a code-checking system via the new digital [[odometer]] readout.\n\nIn late 1998 Dodge introduced a revised front end for the 1999 model year Sport models with a restyled bumper, quad-beam clear-lens [[headlamp]]s, and body-color grille. A 6-speed manual transmission was made optional for diesel variants in late 2000 for the 2001 model year. A small percentage of the diesel engines for 1999 and 2000 model years were subject to problems within the water jackets and fuel injectors. The most problematic was the \"53\" stamped engine block which had a defect that would cause fracturing in the structure of the block itself. The 2000 models became optional with heated leather seats. The braking system was upgraded to dual-piston calipers in the front. An Offroad Edition was offered as a package with a 2-inch lift accomplished with stiffer front springs and rear lift blocks, unique 17x8 wheels, 275/70/17 all terrain tires, 4.10 gears, trussed Dana 44 in the front, limited slip differential, and skid plates.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/ram1.html |title=200 Dodge Ram specifications |publisher=pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=January 27, 2014}}</ref> The Offroad Edition models are also distinguishable with an additional decal on the tailgate under the 4x4 decal that says \"Offroad.\"\n\nAlthough Dodge introduced a new Ram 1500 for 2002, the old second-generation style Ram was carried over for the 2002 model year heavy-duty 2500 and 3500 trucks. The new third-generation Ram would not appear in the 2500/3500 variants until 2003. Part of this delay was due to the then new 5.7&nbsp;L Hemi engine not being ready for production.\n\n====Mexico====\n{{main|Dodge Ramcharger}}\nUnencumbered by CAFE ([[Corporate average fuel economy]]) restrictions, DaimlerChrysler's Mexican subsidiary developed a three-door wagon version of the Ram, called the [[Dodge Ramcharger|Ram Charger]] as was its predecessor. It first appeared in 1998 but was never available in the United States.<ref name=SS03>{{cite book | ref = SS03 | title = Katalog Samochody \u015awiata 2003 | trans-title = World Car Catalogue 2003 | editor-first = Eligiusz | editor-last = Mazur | publisher = Print Shops Prego - Polska Sp. z o.o. | location = Warsaw, Poland | page = 217 | date = 2002 | issn = 1234-8198 }}</ref>\n\n===Drivetrain===\n\n====Transmissions====\nTransmissions for the Ram\n*[[TorqueFlite|A500/42RH-RE]] lower geared light duty applications found behind the 3.9 L V6\n*[[TorqueFlite|A518/46RH-RE]] for more heavy duty applications found behind the 5.2 L and 5.9 L V8 engines.\n*[[TorqueFlite|A618/47RH-RE]] for heavy duty use behind the V10 gasoline and Cummins diesel engines. The 47RH was used in 1994 and 1995 model years, while the 47RE was used from 1996 through 2002.\n[[New Venture Gear 3500 transmission|NV3500]] was offered in 1500 Rams and light-duty 2500 Rams.\n[[New Venture Gear 4500 transmission|NV4500]] was standard in 2500 and 3500 trucks; the NV4500HD for V10 and diesel models (''except the uncommon, light-duty 2500 rams'').\nA [[New Venture Gear 5600 transmission|NV5600]] was offered in 1999 and 2000 Rams and was the only transmission offered behind the High Output diesel in 2001 and 2002.\n\n====Transfer cases====\nThere were a total of five [[transfer case]]s available for the four-wheel-drive Ram. All are part-time and have a low range of 2.72:1. The 1500 featured a NP231 and NP231HD. The NP241 was standard on V8 2500 Rams. The 2500 and 3500 V10 and diesel featured a NP241DLD from 1993 to 1997. In 1997 the NP241DHD became an option for 2500 Rams and was standard on 3500 Rams from 1998 to 2002.\n\n====Axles====\nThe Dodge Ram features a wide variety of axles. For the front axle of 4x4 Rams, a [[Dana 44]] was used on all 1500 Rams and the early (light-duty) 2500 Rams. However, most of the 2500 and all 3500 Rams use [[Dana 60]] front axles. The 1500 Rams and some early light duty 2500 Rams used a 9.25 Chrysler (Spicer) axle in the rear. A [[Dana 60]] rear axle was used on heavy duty 2500 V8 Rams. A [[Dana 70]] rear axle was used in 2500 Rams with a V10 or a Diesel/Automatic transmission combination. A [[Dana 80]] rear axle was used on 2500 Rams with a manual transmission and V10/diesel engine combination. Every 3500 Ram was made with a Dana 80. The front drive axles in these Rams were unique in the fact they did not have [[locking hubs]], but featured a [[center axle disconnect]]. The 2002 2500 and 3500 Rams saw the eventual phase out of the Center axle disconnect, in favor of front axles that were permanently locked in. Dodge continued to include front axles like this for their 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 trucks until 2013 models.\n\n===Engines===\nA [[natural gas|natural-gas-powered]] engine debuted for 1995 but was not popular and was only used in fleet vehicles on a very limited production run. The [[Cummins B Series engine]] was switched from the 12-valve to the 24-valve (ISB) version in the middle of the 1998 model-year Dodge Rams due to emissions regulations. The ISB featured a new computer-controlled electronic injection pump and 24-valve head design.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n!8th VIN\n|-\n|{{nowrap|1994\u20132001}}||{{convert|239|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 3.9L|Magnum]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||{{convert|175|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|225|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}|| X\n|-\n|1994\u20132001||{{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.2|Magnum]]'' [[V8 engine|V8]]||{{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>|| Y\n|-\n|1995\u20131997||{{convert|318|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} Natural Gas V8 ||{{convert|200|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|430|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||\n|-\n|1994\u20131997||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|230|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|325|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||Z (5 for the heavy-duty version)\n|-\n|1998\u20132002||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|245|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|335|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||Z (5 for the heavy-duty version)\n|-\n|1994\u20132002||{{convert|488|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}<ref>[http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/attachments/08192002_VIPER_OVERVIEW.pdf Chapter 3 for 2003: Dodge Viper SRT-10] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320113521/http://www.media.chrysler.com/dcxms/assets/attachments/08192002_VIPER_OVERVIEW.pdf |date=March 20, 2009 }}.

It included longitudinal stripes similar to those on the Dodge Viper along with an optional door sticker stating \"Official Truck of the 80th Indianapolis 500\". These trucks had a {{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine with upgraded exhaust and {{convert|15|hp|abbr=on}} more power. These also included {{convert|17|in|mm|0|adj=on}} wheels with Goodyear Eagle II 275/60R-17 tires. The SS/T (Super Sport Truck) version was available from 1997 to 1998 and included all the same upgrades except the door sticker. The SS/T also had \"SS/T\" designed into the stripe on both the hood and tailgate. The Indy Trucks were available only in blue with white stripes. The SS/Ts were available in white/blue, red/silver, black/silver, and green/silver. All include a specialty sticker on the inner door stating, \"Built with pride in the U.S.A.\" A real Pace truck is a metal plate on the driver's side frame rail, with a raised number 19 on it. However, the SS/Ts do not have this.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n*'''High Output''' - The Ram trucks started offering a diesel High Output package for 2001 models. 2001/2002 H.O. engines were rated 10 horsepower higher than the standard engine.\n*'''Off-Road Edition''' - The Dodge Ram 1500 SLT Off-Road \"Edition\" (package)<ref name=\"Geno's Garage\">{{cite web |title=Dodge Ram Pickup Info |url=http://dodgeram.info/2001/models/1500.html |website=DodgeRam.info |accessdate=16 September 2018}}</ref> was available in the latter portion of the second generation.

This was a major update including an all new frame, suspension, powertrains, interiors, and sheet metal. The crew cab models for this generation were actually Quad Cab trucks that had conventional-opening rear doors. The four-wheel-drive light trucks (1500 series) lost their [[live axle]]s in favor of an [[independent suspension|independent front suspension]], but the 2500 and 3500 series retained the live axles for maximum longevity and durability; rear-wheel-drive 2500 & 3500 had class-exclusive rack and pinion steering for their independent front suspension (the 1500 also received rack and pinion steering for the first time). This body style drew heavily from the previous generation.\n\nThe redesigned trucks bolstered sales, with 400,000 sold during 2001-2002 and nearly 450,000 sold during 2002-2003, a new high point for the Ram name. At the same time, both [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] and [[General Motors|GM]] trucks were increasing in sales from a 2001 peak over 850,000 to the 900,000 range. But with 400,543 Rams sold that year, the Ram's sales could not keep up with the eleventh-generation [[Ford F-Series eleventh generation|F-150]] in 2004.\n\n===2006 Facelift===\n\n[[File:2006-2008 Dodge Ram 1500 -- 03-16-2012.JPG|thumb|left|2006\u20132008 Dodge Ram 1500 Quad Cab]]\n\nThe Dodge Ram was updated for the 2006 model year. One notable addition was the \"Mega Cab\", featuring a {{convert|6.25|ft|m|0|adj=on}} cargo box and {{convert|22|in|0|abbr=}} of extra cab space, allowing seating for six with rear recliners, a full screen mapping in-dash navigation system became an option, and the [[headlamp]]s were redesigned to a more modern design.\n\nFor 2006, the [[steering wheel]] design was changed to one from the [[Dodge Dakota]] and [[Dodge Durango]]. [[Bluetooth]] [[U Connect]] was now available as an option, and a front facelift was given to all Ram models. [[SIRIUS Satellite Radio]] was available, as well was a rear seat [[DVD]] entertainment system with wireless [[headphones]]. The [[Street and Racing Technology|SRT]] model, with the 8.3&nbsp;L [[V10 engine]] from the [[Dodge Viper]] SRT/10, was discontinued after the 2006 [[model year]].\n\nFor 2007, Dodge changed the tail lights.\n\n===Chassis Cab===\nIn 2007, a 3500 Chassis Cab model was introduced with industry-standard rear frame width and wiring to accommodate outfitters. In addition to the {{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}, a [[Cummins]] {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[diesel engine|diesel]] rated at {{convert|350|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|650|lbft|0|abbr=on}} was also available.

The G56 transmission was the only manual transmission offered.\n\nFor 2008, Dodge introduced two more Chassis Cab models, the 4500 and 5500. These were [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class-4]] and [[Truck classification#Class 5|Class-5]] trucks with a gross weight of {{convert|16500|lb|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|19500|lb|0|abbr=on}}, respectively. Both trucks came equipped with the same version of the [[Cummins]] {{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[diesel engine|diesel]] as the 3500 chassis-cab model. [[Sterling Trucks|Sterling]], who worked with Dodge in development, had their own version, called the [[Sterling Bullet]] with a unique grille. Sterling is a division of [[Freightliner LLC]] which, like Dodge, was owned by the former [[DaimlerChrysler]]. [[Sterling Trucks]] was licensed to sell Dodge Ram 4500 series trucks as the Sterling Bullet. When the [[Sterling Trucks|Sterling]] brand was phased out by [[Chrysler Corporation]], the Bullet was discontinued.\n\n===Engines===\n{| class=wikitable\n|-\n!Model\n!Years\n!Engine\n!Power\n!Torque\n|-\n|rowspan=5|1500||2002-2008||{{convert|226|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler PowerTech engine#3.7 EKG|Magnum]]'' [[V6 engine|V6]]||{{convert|215|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|235|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|2002-2007||{{convert|287|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Magnum'' V8 ||{{convert|235|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|2008-2013||{{convert|287|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Magnum'' V8 ||{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=semihemi>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/mopar/47.html| title = The 4.7 Liter \"Next Generation\" and \"semi-Hemi\" V8 Engine (Dodge ) | work = Allpar.com: Trucks | publisher = Allpar LLC | first = Rick | last = Ehrenberg | accessdate = 2014-03-15 }}</ref>||{{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=semihemi/>\n|-\n|2002-2003||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler LA engine#Magnum 5.9|Magnum]]'' V8 ||{{convert|245|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|335|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n|2003-2008||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine#New Hemi|Hemi]]'' V8 ||{{convert|345|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|375|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>\n|-\n| rowspan=\"7\" |2500/3500\n|2009||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8 ||{{convert|390|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002-2003 SO \"6\" Vin Designation||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Cummins B Series engine#ISB|Cummins]]'' [[diesel engine|diesel]] [[Straight-six engine|I6]]||{{convert|250|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002\u20132003 SO California Emissions||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|235|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}||{{convert|460|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002-2004 HO \"C\" Vin Designation||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6||{{convert|305|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}||{{convert|555|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2004.5-2007 HO||{{convert|360|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|325|hp|kW PS|abbr=on}}||{{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2007-2009||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|650|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2002-2003||{{convert|488|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Magnum V10|Magnum]]'' [[V10 engine|V10]]||{{convert|310|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|450|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|rowspan=3|Chassis Cab\n|2008\u20132009||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Chrysler Hemi engine#New Hemi|Hemi]]'' V8 (3500 Only)||{{convert|345|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|375|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2009||{{convert|345|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Hemi'' V8 (3500 Only)||{{convert|388|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"ED-DRG\"/>||{{convert|404|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|2008\u20132009||{{convert|408|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''Cummins'' diesel I6 ||{{convert|305|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}\n|-\n|SRT-10||2004-2006||{{convert|505|cuin|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} ''[[Viper engine#Second generation|Viper]]'' [[V10 engine|V10]]||{{convert|510|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}||{{convert|535|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}\n|}\n\nModels built after January 1, 2007 offered a new 6.7 L Cummins turbo diesel introduced as an option in 2500/3500 models replacing the 5.9 L.

In the front all 2500 and 3500 trucks were 9.25-inch with 33 spline axles. The rear options for the 2500 and 3500 were the AAM (often referred to as \"corporate\") [[10.5\" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#10.5 AAM|10.5]]\" and [[10.5\" Corporate 14 Bolt Differential#11.5 AAM|11.5]]\". Rear axle shafts are 30 spline. The rear 11.5\" has a gear ratio \"carrier split\" at 3.73 and numerically higher, but the General Motors AAM axles used a different carrier spacing preventing installation of a Chrysler carrier into some GM axles, but the GM carrier can be installed in the Chrysler axle if a ring gear spacer is installed. Strength is similar to their earlier Dana 70 and 80 counterparts. Direct comparisons are difficult as the axles are made with completely different [[metallurgy]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:3rd Gen.jpg|2003 Dodge Ram diesel dually quad cab 2wd with the 5.9L Cummins Turbodiesel I6\nFile:2002-05 Dodge Ram.jpg|2005 Dodge Ram 1500 quad cab with the 5.7L Hemi V8\nFile:Dodge-Ram-Mega-Cab.jpg|Dodge Ram 2500 Mega Cab\nFile:Sterling Bullet.jpg|Sterling Bullet, a version of the Ram sold by [[Sterling Trucks]] with the 6.7L Cummins Diesel I6\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n===Special editions===\n* '''HemiSport''' - The HemiSport Edition was the Quad Cab version of the Rumble Bee, and was introduced in 2004.

It includes lower body cladding, 20\" wheels, a hood scoop, and an SLT interior specially trimmed with yellow dashboard and door panel inserts and a serialized number plate. On the rear of the box is a stripe with a \"Rumble Bee\" emblem, similar to that of the [[Dodge Super Bee|Super Bee]]. All Rumble Bees are either black with \"solar yellow\" trim or yellow with black trim.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} 4,858 were produced in 2004, and 5,174 in 2005.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n* '''HemiGTX''' - The Hemi GTX package is a limited sport-truck version of the Ram. Introduced in 2004 and only made in 2004 and 2005, these were customized by LA West of Indiana as ordered from dealers, adding an additional $8,300.50 in sticker price. It was available on regular-cab/short-box and quad-cab/short-box pickups and include a custom overall paint from Mopar's Impact colors from the 1970s (this includes Hemi Orange, Plum Crazy Purple, Sublime Green, and Banana Yellow). 20\" American Racing Motto chrome wheels, a new cowl \"blacked-out\" hood, and a specially trimmed leather 2-tone interior including a serialized number plate on the driver's-side doorjamb were offered. On the sides is a \"hockey-stick\" stripe with \"HEMI GTX\" that extended from the hood to the rear of the box. The air box was also painted to match the body color, and a color-matched steering wheel was added as well. They were only 433 produced in 2004 and roughly the same number in 2005. A certificate of authenticity was given to all original owners.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n[[File:'02-'05 Dodge Ram Daytona Crew Cab 1500.JPG|thumb|2005 Dodge Ram Daytona]]\n* '''Daytona''' - Introduced for 2005, the Ram Daytona was a new sport-truck edition of the Ram. It was available as a 5.7-liter Hemi V8 in Regular or Quad-Cab styles and featured lower-body cladding, 20-inch chrome wheels, SRT-10 hood, Borla dual exhaust, serialized number plate, and a tall rear spoiler reminiscent of the 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]]. The Daytonas had a black body stripe to match the rear spoiler and came in silver or \"Go Mango\" paint (a metallic orange color reminiscent of the Dodge's \"high impact\" colors from the 1960s and 1970s) with matching interior trim. The Dodge Ram Daytona had a 3.92 ratio rear end, the same rear end as the Dodge Ram Rumble Bee. Several exterior items were unique to the Daytona package (such as the gas door and dual side exit exhaust tips) which made it different from other equipment packages. It was equipped with {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} [[chrome plating|chrome]] wheels and performance tires. Replacing the standard hood is one with a non-functional [[hood scoop]]. The most noticeable feature is the large [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] which is attached at the rear of the cargo box. The {{convert|11|in|mm|adj=on}} spoiler lined up with the flat black stripe that ran along the back of the bed side with the word 'Daytona' written in the middle. This spoiler is reminiscent of the 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n*'''Contractor's Special hybrid''' - Dodge announced a [[hybrid car|hybrid]] version of the Ram, dubbed the ''Contractor's Special'', in 2003. However, the schedule for delivery slipped as Dodge backed away from the vehicle. The hybrid Ram was available only for fleet purchasers (if at all) and did not enter mass production. It offered an [[alternating current|AC]] electrical outlet panel for running an entire job site worth of power tools, but the through-the-road method of balancing the gas engine and electric motor reportedly did not work as desired. Dodge has announced that it would use a hybrid transmission developed jointly with [[General Motors]] and [[BMW]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allpar.com/model/ram/special-rams.html |title=Specialty Dodge Rams |work=Allpar |accessdate=2010-11-22}}</ref>\n*'''NightRunner''' - 400 of these were assembled from January 2006 to December 2006 (200 Single-cab and 200 Quad-cab).

Later models have the Rambox system tied in with the [[remote keyless system]]<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.ihs.com/products/global-insight/industry-economic-report.aspx?ID=106597245&pu=1&rd=globalinsight_com |title=NAIAS 2008: Pick-Up Trucks Debut Amid Green Technologies |first=Candida |last=Scott |first2=Roger |last2=Kranenburg |first3=Deborah |last3=Mann |first4=Andrew |last4=Day|publisher=Global Insight |date=January 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Class exclusive manual transmission===\n[[File:2011 Dodge Power Wagon.jpg|thumb|left|2011 Ram [[Power Wagon]]]]\n\nSince 2011, Ram trucks are marketed as having \"class-exclusive\" [[manual transmission]]s. This is because the competitors stopped making manual transmissions available in the domestic market. [[Chevrolet Silverado]] trucks discontinued the option of a manual transmission after model year 2006. [[Ford Super Duty]] trucks discontinued the option of a manual transmission after model year 2010. This applies to [[Truck classification#Class 2|Class 2]], [[Truck classification#Class 3|Class 3]], [[Truck classification#Class 4|Class 4]] and [[Truck classification#Class 5|Class 5]] trucks. 2011 and 2012 models make {{convert|350|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|610|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Horsepower remained the same for 2013 models, torque however, was increased to {{convert|660|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.

The 3500 Heavy Duty model was unveiled at the 2009 [[Chicago Auto Show]].\n\nEngine choices include 5.7&nbsp;L Hemi V8 rated at {{convert|383|bhp|kW||abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm and {{convert|542|Nm|lbft||abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm for Ram 3500, 6.7 l Cummins turbo diesel rated at {{convert|350|bhp|kW|0|abbr=on}} at 3,013 rpm and {{convert|880|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 1,500 rpm for Ram 3500 (optional), 4500, 5500.

Both transmissions support the Power Takeoff option.\n\nThe 3500 model has regular or crew cab, single-rear-wheel or dual-rear-wheel. Four cab-axle lengths (60, 84, 108 and 120&nbsp;inches) for 4500/5500 or two cab-axle lengths (60 and 84&nbsp;inches) for 3500, and three trim levels (ST, SLT and Laramie).\n\nThe Ram 3500 has three axle ratios (3.42, 3.73 and 4.10) and 17-inch wheels. Ram 4500/5500 has three axle ratios (4.10, 4.44 and 4.88) and 19.5-inch wheels. The 4500/5500 Rams rear axle is a [[Dana S 110]]. The front axle on 4x4 models is manufactured by [[Magna International|Magna]], while 2-wheel-drive models just have a solid, non-drive axle.\n\n====Concept truck====\nThe Ram concept truck \"Long Hauler\" from 2012 is based mostly on existing Ram truck parts. The powertrain, frame and wheels are all components of the Ram 5500 Chassis Cab. It is a \"Mega Cab\" optional on the lighter Rams. The [[Gross combined weight rating|GCWR]] for this truck is 37,500&nbsp;lb and the weight of the truck is 9,300&nbsp;lb.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allpar.com/cars/concepts/ram/long-hauler.html|title=Long Hauler |accessdate=12 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n===2013 changes===\n[[File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 01 China 2014-04-24.jpg|thumb|2013 Ram 1500]]\n[[File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 02 China 2014-04-24.jpg|thumb|2013 Ram 1500]]\n\nThe 1500 gets a minor restyling. It features new front fascia, optional projector beam halogen headlamps with [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] turn signals/parking lamps, wheels and interior, where the \"DODGE\" name was removed from the dashboard and replaced with \"RAM\".\n\nAll models offered for 2012 continue to be available for 2013 with the addition of a new trim, the Laramie, Longhorn, Limited. (Tradesman, Express, SLT, Big Horn, Lone Star, Sport, R/T, Laramie, and Laramie Longhorn). The Rambox cargo management system continues to be available on most models for 2013. For 2013, the base ST model becomes the Tradesman model.\n\n2013 models have revised engine and transmission options. The 3.7&nbsp;L V6 is discontinued, and the 4.7&nbsp;L V8 equipped with the 6-speed 65RFE Automatic takes its place as the new base engine, still producing {{convert|310|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|330|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. New to the lineup is Chrysler's corporate 3.6&nbsp;L Pentastar V6, coupled to the new [[ZF Friedrichshafen|ZF]] 8-speed Torqueflite8 Automatic. It achieves best in class fuel efficiency and makes {{convert|305|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|269|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}. The Pentastar/ZF 8-speed is optional. Due to a new electric power steering system, the 5.7&nbsp;L HEMI V8 no longer has a power steering pump, and gains 5 horsepower, now making {{convert|395|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|410|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}. It is still available with the 65RFE 6-speed Automatic, with the new 8-speed Torqueflite8 Automatic optional.\n\n[[Air suspension]] is optional for 2013 models, offering four ride height settings. [[Electronic stability control]] becomes standard on 2500 and 3500 models. For 2013, the Ram is also the first North American pickup truck to offer [[Smart key|keyless ignition]].\n\nNew infotainment systems are available for the RAM 1500 for 2013:\n\nThe base U Connect 3.0 (RA1) radio includes an AM/FM radio, Radio Data System (RDS), a monochrome LCD display screen, a 3.5-millimeter auxiliary audio input jack, and a single USB port for charging purposes only.\n\nThe \"up-level\" U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) radio adds a full-color, 5.0-inch color touch-screen display, voice control for phone, a microSD card slot, Bluetooth for phone and A2DP wireless stereo audio streaming capabilities, and vehicle customization options on-screen.\n\nThe \"top-of-the-line\" radios are the U Connect ACCESS 8.4A (RA3) and U Connect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4). These radios add a full-color, 8.4-inch color touch-screen display, full voice control, [[SiriusXM]] satellite radio, the U Connect ACCESS System, featuring roadside assistance and 9-1-1 emergency call buttons on the rear-view mirror, mobile app compatibility, remote USB ports for integration of compatible devices, enhanced in-vehicle customization options, automatic notification of airbag deployment, concierge services, remote control via an app installed on a compatible [[smartphone]], and the ability to add GPS navigation from [[Garmin]] for vehicles not equipped with the option from the factory (it is activated by a dealership for a fee, however, does not include SiriusXM Travel Link or 3D mapping). The U Connect ACCESS 8.4AN (RA4) adds GPS navigation from Garmin, [[HD Radio]] SiriusXM Travel Link, 3D mapping, and enhanced mobile app compatibility. The system also includes a built-in [[3G]] internet router, allowing for wireless connection to the internet while the vehicle is parked with a monthly service subscription. The system can also be updated to add additional features that will be available in the future via a USB stick inserted into one of the remote USB ports. Remote steering wheel-mounted controls are also included with this system.\n\nOptions such as a CD Player (mounted in the center console of the vehicle), SiriusXM satellite radio  and a Rearview Backup Camera can be added to any radio.\n\n====3500====\nThe 2013 models move up to an 18-inch standard wheel, with 18-inch [[Forging|forged]] [[Alcoa]] wheels as an option. 3500 models offer a High Output package for the diesel. The rear [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] ring gear is increased from 11.5 inches, to 11.8 inches on H.O. trucks. The 11.8 axle cover doubles as a [[heat sink]].\n\n====4x4====\nRam, once again, put the [[Center axle disconnect]] in 3500 4x4 models. 2500 Ram trucks did not have a CAD system until 2014 models. Ram claims this technology to improve fuel efficiency by 1 MPG, although [[EPA]] tests do not include class 2 and class 3 trucks in the [[Miles per gallon|MPG]]/fuel efficiency tests. The 4x4 saw additional changes with the [[transfer case]] now being made by [[BorgWarner]] instead of [[New Venture Gear]].\n\n====High Fuel Efficiency====\nA new model offered for the 2013 Ram is the HFE (High Fuel Efficiency). Based on the SLT model, the HFE offers 18/25 [[Miles per gallon|MPG]] out of its [[Pentastar]] V6 engine and eight-speed [[ZF 8HP transmission|Torque-Flite]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]], which has nothing in common with the original Chrysler built [[TorqueFlite]]. It is available only in the six-foot bed, two-door, regular cab model with two-wheel-drive only. Standard features include a 220 amp [[Alternator#Automotive alternators|alternator]] and an 800 amp battery to assist with the [[Start-stop system]]. 3.21:1 axle gearing is also standard.\n\n===2014 changes===\n[[File:2014RAM3500.jpg|thumb|2014 Ram 3500 crew cab, 4\u00d74, DRW]]\nThe option of [[air suspension]] became available on the rear of 2014 model year 2500 and 3500 pick up trucks. 1500 models added the option of an [[List of VM Motori engines#A 630 DOHC|Eco-Diesel V6]]. 2500 models now feature coil spring suspension, instead of leaf spring. The cast iron, flex fuel, 4.7 V8 [[Chrysler PowerTech engine]] was discontinued, ending Corsair engine production, leaving the Ram 1500 with two engine choices. The aluminum, flex fuel 3.6 V6 [[Pentastar]] is now the base engine, along with the 8-speed [[ZF 8HP transmission|Torque-Flite]] [[transmission (mechanics)|transmission]]. The 3.6&nbsp;L Pentastar V6 was available on Laramie and Longhorn trims.<ref>{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Mark|title=Ram Will Offer Pentastar V6 in Top Trim Levels|url= http://news.pickuptrucks.com/2014/03/ram-will-offer-pentastar-v-6-in-top-trim-levels.html |work=pickuptrucks.com |accessdate=16 April 2014}}</ref> The Ram heavy-duty series of trucks (2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500) received a new interior design and revised exterior styling from the Ram 1500, which was restyled in 2013.\n\n===2016 changes===\n[[File:Rebel1.jpg|thumb|2016 Ram Rebel]]\nFor 2016, the all-new Ram 1500 '''Rebel''' debuted, offering off-road suspension with a {{convert|1.0|in|cm|1}} higher ride height, larger tires, and a unique interior to add to the Ram 1500 '''Big Horn''' and '''Lone Star''' trim levels.

This was previously a $495.00 option on the Ram '''SLT'''.\n\n===2017 changes===\nFor 2017, the Ram 1500 Laramie Longhorn and Limited trims received the new RAM front grille and \"RAM\" emblem across the rear tailgate that debuted on the 2016 RAM 1500 Rebel.\n\nIn mid-2017, the RAM 1500's 3.0&nbsp;L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbodiesel engine, produced by [[VM Motori]], was dropped in mid-2017 in response to emissions cheating allegations. The engine will be re-introduced in early 2018, as re-certification by the [[EPA]] has been obtained.\n\nThe 1500 SLT model loses the U Connect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) option, leaving the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) radio as the only radio option. However. all Ram heavy-duty (2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500) SLT models will still offer the U Connect ACCESS 8.4 infotainment system (RA3) as an option.\n\nThe Rebel trim level of the Ram 1500 gains the previously-optional U Connect ACCESS 8.4A infotainment system as standard equipment, as do the Big Horn and Lone Star trim levels. A Rebel Black Edition Package is available that adds black accents to the Rebel.\n\nThe Laramie trim level of the Ram 1500, 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 gets a standard nine-speaker, 506-watt [[Alpine Electronics|Alpine]] 7.1-channel surround-sound premium audio system as standard equipment.\n\nThree new special edition trim levels debut for 2017 for the Ram 1500 model:\n\n* The Lone Star Silver Edition, available exclusively at Ram dealerships in [[Texas]] and based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, adds additional chrome trim pieces to the trim level. It debuted at the 2016 [[Texas State Fair]].\n* The Lone Star Yellow Rose Edition, also available exclusively at Ram dealerships in Texas and also based on the Texas-only Lone Star trim level, is available only in a model-exclusive Stinger Yellow Clear Coat exterior paint color. It debuted at the 2016 Texas State Fair.\n* The Night Edition, available at Ram dealerships nationwide, is based on the Sport trim level, and adds black-finished emblems, twenty-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, front grille, door handles, and emblems to the model.\n\nThere is also a new Off-Road Package available for all Ram 2500 models (aside from the Power Wagon trim level, which includes the package as standard equipment), and includes unique pickup bedside graphics, off-road suspension, front tow hooks, and the protection package.\n\nThe mid-level SLT trim level of the RAM 1500 is no longer available to retail customers, as it is now a lesser-equipped model reserved exclusively for fleet customers. However, the SLT trim level still remains for the Ram 2500, 3500, 4500, and 5500 models, and are still available to retail customers. However, retail customers wanting SLT features such as chrome front and rear bumpers and front grille, seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, power windows and door locks with keyless entry, the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, cloth seating surfaces, [[SiriusXM]] [[Satellite Radio]], a rear-view backup camera system, and floor carpeting, can still opt for the Chrome Appearance and Popular Equipment Packages on the Tradesman model.\n\nFor customers wanting a less expensive [[Bluetooth]] option for the Ram truck, a new U Connect 3.0BT (RA2) radio is available for an additional $200.00, which includes an A/M-F/M radio and SiriusXM Satellite Radio tuner, Radio Data System (RDS), U Connect Bluetooth hands-free phone system with audio streaming and voice command, steering wheel-mounted remote voice command controls, a USB port and 3.5&nbsp;mm auxiliary audio input jack, and a three-inch (3.0\") monochrome LCD display screen. This radio option is available for the Tradesman trim level of all Ram trucks, and the Express trim level of the Ram 1500, and is included as part of a Popular Equipment Package on the latter model. Previously, customers wanting Bluetooth on a Ram Tradesman or Ram 1500 Express would have to upgrade to the U Connect 5.0BT (RA2) touch-screen radio, which would add the same features as described above, as well as onscreen vehicle customization via the radio, and a full five-inch (5.0\") color touch-screen display, and cost an additional $495.00. In order to do this, the customer would also have to select the Popular Equipment Package on both models.\n\nThe RAM 2500 Power Wagon returned with a 6.4&nbsp;L [[HEMI]] gasoline V8 engine, a unique graphics package (delete option), black front grille, door handles, larger tires and black aluminum-alloy wheels, and the Off-Road Package. The Power Wagon Package is also available for the Ram 2500 Tradesman trim level, and also adds the 6.4L HEMI gasoline V8 engine.\n\n===2018 changes===\nChanges to the Ram for 2018 included the addition of [[HD Radio]] to all U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems, as well as a new [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] wireless hot-spot provided by [[AT&T Wireless]], an AT&T Wireless 4G LTE in-vehicle modem (both the AT&T Wireless 4G LTE modem and 4G LTE mobile hot-spot replace the [[Sprint Corporation|Sprint]] [[3G]] [[CDMA]] modem and 3G CDMA mobile hot-spot offered on previous Ram models), [[Apple CarPlay]] and [[Android Auto]] smartphone integration for the U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems, and the SiriusXM Guardian service replacing the U Connect ACCESS service offered on previous RAM models for the U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems. In addition, all U Connect 8.4 infotainment systems get a new [[User Interface]] design for easier navigation of menus and applications.\n\nThe [[VM Motori]]-produced 3.0&nbsp;L [[EcoDiesel]] V6 turbodiesel engine returned in early 2018 for the RAM 1500, as it has been re-certified by the [[EPA]] after allegations of emissions cheating in 2017.\n\nMost upper trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Sport, Rebel, Laramie Longhorn, and Limited) get the new RAM front grille introduced for 2016, as well as a large 'RAM' emblem on the rear tailgate. Lower to mid trim levels of the RAM 1500 (Tradesman, Express, Big Horn, Lone Star, and Laramie) retain the standard RAM \"Cross-Hair\" front grille.\n\nThe Night Edition and Lone Star Silver Edition trim levels were continued.\n\nFor 2018, there are two new special editions:\n* The Harvest Edition (also available on the Ram 2500 and 3500), are based on the Big Horn and Lone Star models. Available in only four paint colors, two of which are unique to the Harvest Edition (Case IH Red, New Holland Blue, two-tone Black Clear Coat and Bright Silver Metallic, or Bright White Clear Coat). Aimed at farmers, the Harvest Edition adds features that are otherwise optional on the Big Horn and Lone Star, such as seventeen-inch chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels with all-terrain tires on 4X4 models, the U Connect 8.4 infotainment system with GPS navigation, [[SiriusXM]] Travel Link with five years of service included and one year of SiriusXM Guardian service, a trailer tow package with integrated trailer brake control, rear-mounted tow hitch, and trailer tow side mirrors. Also included are front bucket seats with power front driver's seat trimmed in premium cloth, chrome side steps, chrome side mirror covers, chrome door handles, and chrome front tow hooks. It is available as either a Quad Cab or a Crew Cab.\n* The Laramie Longhorn Southfork Edition Package, available on 1500, 2500, and 3500 Laramie Longhorn models, adds even more luxury features to the already luxurious truck, such as unique twenty-inch polished aluminum-alloy wheels, unique real wood interior trim, and a unique two-tone blue-and-beige interior color scheme.\n\n===2019 changes===\n\nFor 2019, the current fourth-generation Ram 1500 will be sold alongside its successor, the fifth-generation Ram 1500.

All 109 Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrids and 23 [[Chrysler Town & Country#Town & Country Plug-in hybrid|Chrysler Town & Country plug-in hybrid]]s deployed by the program were recalled due to damage sustained by three separate pickup trucks when their 12.9 [[kWh]] battery packs overheated. The carmaker plans to upgrade the battery packs with cells that use a different lithium-ion chemistry before the vehicles go back into service. Chrysler explained that no one was injured from any of the incidents, and the vehicles were not occupied at the time, nor any of the minivans were involved in any incident, but they were withdrawn as a precaution. The demonstration is a program jointly funded by Chrysler and the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] that includes the first-ever factory-produced vehicles capable of reverse power flow. The experimental system would allow fleet operators to use their plug-in hybrids to supply electricity for a building during a power outage, reduce power usage when electric rates are high or even sell electricity back to their utility company.<ref name=Chrysler>{{cite web|url= http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1079368_chrysler-yanks-plug-in-hybrid-test-fleet-off-roads-will-replace-batteries|title=Chrysler Yanks Plug-In Hybrid Test Fleet Off Roads, Will Replace Batteries|first=John |last=Voelcker |publisher=Green Car Reports |date=2012-09-24|accessdate=2012-09-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120924/AUTO0101/209240429 |title=Chrysler halts tests on plug-in hybrid fleet after batteries overheat |first=Bryce G. |last=Hoffman |newspaper=The Detroit News |date=2012-09-24 |accessdate=2012-09-30 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The company reported that the demonstration fleet had collectively accumulated 1.3 million miles (2.1 million km) before the vehicles were recalled.

Germany and Scandinavian countries are some of the largest European markets for the Ram. A thriving cottage industry in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom has imported and converted Ram trucks to right-hand-drive and to meet the local regulations, being more common in Australia since LHD cars less than 30 years old (or 15 years old if registered in Western Australia) cannot be legally driven on Australian public roads unless they are granted a diplomatic or a research and development exception to the rule. In the United Kingdom there is no such restriction, so a stock LHD Ram (or any other LHD vehicle) is not required to undergo the costly and time-consuming process of an RHD conversion in order to be compliant with EU regulations.\n\n===Gray import gallery===\n{{gallery\n|File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift 2 China 2014-04-24.jpg|2014 Ram 1500 Crew Cab in [[China]]\n|File:Ram 1500 DS Crew Cab facelift China 2014-04-24.jpg|Ram 1500 in China\n|File:Ram truck parked at the Palac Kultury I Nauki - Warsaw.jpg|Dodge Ram 3500 in [[Warsaw, Poland]]\n}}\n\n===Nissan Titan===\nFollowing the collapse of [[Nissan Titan]] sales in 2008, there were talks<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.pickuptrucks.com/html/news/nissan/titan/chryslertitan2.html |title=Chrysler Will Make Full Size Light Duty Truck for Nissan\n|first=Mike |last=Levine |publisher=Cars.com|date=April 14, 2008 |accessdate=April 1, 2012 }}</ref> that the next generation of Nissan's full-sized pickup would be outsourced to Chrysler as a version of the Ram 1500.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090511/OEM02/305119805 |title=Nissan exec: Pickup deal is too good to drop |first=Lindsay |last=Chappell |journal=Automotive News |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2012 }}</ref> Nissan had been planning to phase out Titan production in its Canton, Mississippi factory in 2010 with the new Nissan-only design for a cab, body and interior riding on the Dodge Ram chassis assembled in Chrysler's truck assembly lines in Saltillo, Mexico.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nissan prepares for key line changes |date=August 11, 2008 |first=Lindsay |last=Chappell |journal=Automotive News |url=http://www.autonews.com/article/20080811/OEM04/308119976 |accessdate=April 1, 2012 }}</ref> However, the deal to build Nissan Titan pickups off the full-sized Dodge Ram pickup starting in 2011 was delayed with the changes at Chrysler and Fiat.<ref>{{cite journal |title=As Chrysler ponders building next Titan, Nissan seeks Plan B |date=August 24, 2009 |first=Lindsay |last=Chappell |journal=Automotive News |url= http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090824/GLOBAL02/308249869 |accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> Nissan eventually decided to keep the Titan,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.autonews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100118/RETAIL/301189991/1316/mobile01&template=art4 |title=Nissan Titan still has a future |first=Rick |last=Kranz |date=January 18, 2010 |newspaper=Automotive News|accessdate=April 1, 2012}}</ref> and went on to release the second generation Titan as a 2016 model called the Titan XD.\n\n==Special Edition Rams==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2010}}\n\n*'''Express''' - The Express is a Dodge Ram 1500 that offered special badges, 20\" tires and wheels from the Dodge Ram 1500 SLT, cloth seating surfaces, and a 5.7L HEMI V8 engine.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n*'''2012 Detroit Red Wings Edition''' - The Detroit Red Wings Edition is a Crew Cab model with 4x4, special Red Wings seats and \"Detroit Red Wings Edition\" decals (on both sides of the box and on the lower left of the tailgate).

The tests were originally developed by [[John C. Raven]] in 1936.<ref name=\"original-raven\">Raven, J. C. (1936). ''Mental tests used in genetic studies: The performance of related individuals on tests mainly educative and mainly reproductive.''  MSc Thesis, [[University of London]].</ref> In each test item, the subject is asked to identify the missing element that completes a pattern. Many patterns are presented in the form of a 6\u00d76, 4\u00d74, 3\u00d73, or 2\u00d72 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], giving the test its name.\n\n==Problem structure==\n[[Image:Raven Matrix.svg|thumb|right|An IQ test item in the style of a Raven's Progressive Matrices test. Given eight patterns, the subject must identify the missing ninth pattern]]\n\nAll of the questions on the Raven's progressives consist of visual geometric design with a missing piece. The test taker is given six to eight choices to pick from and fill in the missing piece.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRaven's Progressive Matrices and Vocabulary tests were originally developed for use in research into the genetic and environmental origins of cognitive ability. Raven thought that the tests commonly in use at that time were cumbersome to administer and the results difficult to interpret. Accordingly, he set about developing simple measures of the two main components of [[G factor (psychometrics)|Spearman's ''g'']]: the ability to think clearly and make sense of complexity (known as eductive ability) and the ability to store and reproduce information (known as reproductive ability).\n\nRaven's tests of both were developed with the aid of what later became known as [[item response theory]].\n\nRaven first published his Progressive Matrices in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1938. His three sons established [[Scotland]]-based test publisher J C Raven Ltd. in 1972. In 2004, [[Harcourt Assessment|Harcourt Assessment, Inc.]] a division of [[Harcourt Education]] acquired J C Raven Ltd. Harcourt was later acquired by [[Pearson PLC]].\n\n==Versions==\nThe Matrices are available in three different forms for participants of different ability:\n\n* '''Standard Progressive Matrices:''' These were the original form of the matrices, first published in 1938. The booklet comprises five sets (A to E) of 12 items each (e.g., A1 through A12), with items within a set becoming increasingly difficult, requiring ever greater cognitive capacity to encode and analyze information. All items are presented in black ink on a white background.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Psychological Testing: An Introduction|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OiKau0aqtsYC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2006-04-24|isbn = 9781139455145|language = en|first = George|last = Domino|first2 = Marla L.|last2 = Domino}}</ref>\n* '''Colored Progressive Matrices:''' Designed for children aged 5 through 11 years-of-age, the elderly, and mentally and physically impaired individuals. This test contains sets A and B from the standard matrices, with a further set of 12 items inserted between the two, as set Ab. Most items are presented on a coloured background to make the test visually stimulating for participants. However the very last few items in set B are presented as [[black-on-white]]; in this way, if a subject exceeds the tester's expectations, transition to sets C, D, and E of the standard matrices is eased.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* '''Advanced Progressive Matrices:''' The advanced form of the matrices contains 48 items, presented as one set of 12 (set I), and another of 36 (set II). Items are again presented in black ink on a white background, and become increasingly difficult as progress is made through each set. These items are appropriate for adults and adolescents of above-average intelligence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn addition, \"parallel\" forms of the standard and coloured progressive matrices were published in 1998. This was to address the problem of the Raven's Matrices being too well known in the general population.  Items in the parallel tests have been constructed so that average solution rates to each question are identical for the classic and parallel versions. A revised version of the SPM \u2013 the '''Standard Progressive Matrices Plus''' \u2013 was published at the same time. This was based on the \"parallel\" version but, although the test was the same length, it had more difficult items in order to restore the test's ability to differentiate among more able adolescents and young adults that the original SPM had when it was first published. This new test, developed with the aid of better sampling arrangements and developments in the procedures available to implement the [[item response theory]], has turned out to have exemplary test properties.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Uses==\nThe tests were initially developed for research purposes. Because of their independence of language and reading and writing skills, and the simplicity of their use and interpretation, they quickly found widespread practical application. For example, all entrants to the British armed forces from 1942 onwards took a twenty-minute version of the SPM, and potential officers took a specially adapted version as part of British [[War Office Selection Boards]]. The routine administration of what became the Standard Progressive Matrices to all entrants (conscripts) to many military services throughout the world (including the Soviet Union) continued at least until the present century. It was by bringing together these data that [[James Flynn (academic)|James R. Flynn]] was able to place the intergenerational increase in scores beyond reasonable doubt.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Flynn, James R. |title=Massive IQ Gains in 14 Nations: What IQ Tests Really Measure |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=171\u2013191 |date= March 1987  |url=http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/flynn1987.pdf |accessdate=13 May 2013 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.101.2.171 |ref=harv }}</ref> Flynn's path-breaking publications on IQ gains around the world have led to the phenomenon of the gains being known as the [[Flynn effect]].

Many patterns are presented in the form of a 6\u00d76, 4\u00d74, 3\u00d73, or 2\u00d72 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]], giving the test its name.\n\n==Problem structure==\n[[Image:Raven Matrix.svg|thumb|right|An IQ test item in the style of a Raven's Progressive Matrices test. Given eight patterns, the subject must identify the missing ninth pattern]]\n\nAll of the questions on the Raven's progressives consist of visual geometric design with a missing piece. The test taker is given six to eight choices to pick from and fill in the missing piece.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nRaven's Progressive Matrices and Vocabulary tests were originally developed for use in research into the genetic and environmental origins of cognitive ability. Raven thought that the tests commonly in use at that time were cumbersome to administer and the results difficult to interpret. Accordingly, he set about developing simple measures of the two main components of [[G factor (psychometrics)|Spearman's ''g'']]: the ability to think clearly and make sense of complexity (known as eductive ability) and the ability to store and reproduce information (known as reproductive ability).\n\nRaven's tests of both were developed with the aid of what later became known as [[item response theory]].\n\nRaven first published his Progressive Matrices in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1938. His three sons established [[Scotland]]-based test publisher J C Raven Ltd. in 1972. In 2004, [[Harcourt Assessment|Harcourt Assessment, Inc.]] a division of [[Harcourt Education]] acquired J C Raven Ltd. Harcourt was later acquired by [[Pearson PLC]].\n\n==Versions==\nThe Matrices are available in three different forms for participants of different ability:\n\n* '''Standard Progressive Matrices:''' These were the original form of the matrices, first published in 1938. The booklet comprises five sets (A to E) of 12 items each (e.g., A1 through A12), with items within a set becoming increasingly difficult, requiring ever greater cognitive capacity to encode and analyze information. All items are presented in black ink on a white background.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = Psychological Testing: An Introduction|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=OiKau0aqtsYC|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2006-04-24|isbn = 9781139455145|language = en|first = George|last = Domino|first2 = Marla L.|last2 = Domino}}</ref>\n* '''Colored Progressive Matrices:''' Designed for children aged 5 through 11 years-of-age, the elderly, and mentally and physically impaired individuals. This test contains sets A and B from the standard matrices, with a further set of 12 items inserted between the two, as set Ab. Most items are presented on a coloured background to make the test visually stimulating for participants. However the very last few items in set B are presented as [[black-on-white]]; in this way, if a subject exceeds the tester's expectations, transition to sets C, D, and E of the standard matrices is eased.<ref name=\":0\" />\n* '''Advanced Progressive Matrices:''' The advanced form of the matrices contains 48 items, presented as one set of 12 (set I), and another of 36 (set II). Items are again presented in black ink on a white background, and become increasingly difficult as progress is made through each set. These items are appropriate for adults and adolescents of above-average intelligence.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn addition, \"parallel\" forms of the standard and coloured progressive matrices were published in 1998. This was to address the problem of the Raven's Matrices being too well known in the general population.  Items in the parallel tests have been constructed so that average solution rates to each question are identical for the classic and parallel versions. A revised version of the SPM \u2013 the '''Standard Progressive Matrices Plus''' \u2013 was published at the same time. This was based on the \"parallel\" version but, although the test was the same length, it had more difficult items in order to restore the [[discrimination]] that the original SPM had among more able adolescents and young adults when it was first published. This new test, developed with the aid of better sampling arrangements and developments in the procedures available to implement the [[item response theory]], has turned out to have exemplary test properties.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}\n\n==Uses==\nThe tests were initially developed for research purposes. Because of their independence of language and reading and writing skills, and the simplicity of their use and interpretation, they quickly found widespread practical application. For example, all entrants to the British armed forces from 1942 onwards took a twenty-minute version of the SPM, and potential officers took a specially adapted version as part of British [[War Office Selection Boards]]. The routine administration of what became the Standard Progressive Matrices to all entrants (conscripts) to many military services throughout the world (including the Soviet Union) continued at least until the present century. It was by bringing together these data that [[James Flynn (academic)|James R. Flynn]] was able to place the intergenerational increase in scores beyond reasonable doubt.<ref>{{Cite journal |author=Flynn, James R. |title=Massive IQ Gains in 14 Nations: What IQ Tests Really Measure |journal=[[Psychological Bulletin]] |volume=101 |issue=2 |pages=171\u2013191 |date= March 1987  |url=http://www.iapsych.com/iqmr/fe/LinkedDocuments/flynn1987.pdf |accessdate=13 May 2013 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.101.2.171 |ref=harv }}</ref> Flynn's path-breaking publications on IQ gains around the world have led to the phenomenon of the gains being known as the [[Flynn effect]].

The company made the foil strips codenamed ''[[Chaff (countermeasure)|Window]]'' used by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] to blind enemy radar.<ref>http://www.dacorumheritage.org.uk/article/dickinsons-at-war/</ref>\n\n=== Dickinson Robinson Group ===\n\u2033[[Dickinson Robinson Group|Dickinson Robinson Group Ltd]]\u2033 (DRG) was formed out of [[E. S. & A. Robinson]] Packaging of [[Bristol]] and [[John Dickinson (inventor)|John Dickinson]] & Co Ltd. in 1966, creating one of the world's largest stationery and packaging companies. In 1989, the [[Asset stripping|asset-stripper]] [[Roland Franklin]] (Pembridge Investments) acquired DRG (by now including the Royal Sovereign group acquired in 1978) in a leveraged buyout worth \u00a3900 million.\n\n=== Fate ===\n\u2033Pembridge Investments\u2033 carved the \u2033Dickinson Robinson Group\u2033 up and sold its parts for a profit to various other companies:\n\n* In 1990 it sold the paper mills in the group, Nash Mills, Keynsham Paper Mill and Fife Paper Mills, to \u2033[[Sappi]]\u2033 of [[South Africa]]. These mills were subsequently closed by Sappi as were all other acquisitions (Kymmini Oy, Blackburn Mill and Wolvercote Mill) they had made in the UK. \n\n* Also in 1990 \u2033DRG Stationery\u2033 was acquired by \u2033Biber Holding AG\u2033 of [[Switzerland]] and renamed \u2033John Dickinson Stationery\u2033. After Biber got insolvent in 1996, \u2033John Dickinson Stationery\u2033 was sold in the same year to \u2033[[James Spicer & Sons|Spicers Ltd]]\u2033, then a subsidiary of \u2033[[DS Smith]]\u2033, and moved from Apsley to the village of [[Sawston]], south of [[Cambridge]]. In 2005, \u2033John Dickinson Stationery\u2033 was purchased by the French stationery manufacturer \u2033[[:fr:Groupe Hamelin|Hamelin Group]]\u2033. Rebranded in 2008 as ''Hamelin Brands'', the company moved to [[Red Lodge, Suffolk]].<ref name=\"Hamelin\" />\n\n* In 1992 \u2033DRG Packaging\u2033 was acquired by \u2033Bowater plc\u2033 (later \u2033[[Rexam]]\u2033). \n\n== Frogmore Paper Mill ==\nJust north of the former Apsley Mill site in [[Hemel Hempstead]] is [[Frogmore Paper Mill]], the world's oldest mechanised paper mill. It was here that Bryan Donkin first demonstrated the paper machine he developed for the Fourdrinier brothers. Now operated by a conservation and education charitable trust, Frogmore Mill is open to the public and incorporates a visitor centre, museum exhibition hall and art gallery as well as continuing to make paper on machine and by hand.\n\n== Black n' Red ==\n[[Image:Black n' red notepad.JPG|thumb|'Black n' Red' book with side binding]]\nBlack n' Red, a brand of books and pads of paper produced by John Dickinson Stationery Limited, featured a striking black and red design. The front and back covers of such books are black, with the text \"Black n' Red\" written in red in the bottom right corner of the cover.

The [[Kennedy Space Center]] will remain at stage 3, with one member of the workforce that has tested positive but given mandatory telework policy the individual had not been on site for over a week prior to symptoms.\n\nAt Stage 4, mandatory telework is in effect for all personnel, with the exception of limited personnel required for mission-essential work and to care-take, maintain the safety and security of the facility.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.nasa.gov/bridenstine/2020/03/24/march-24-update-on-nasa-response-to-coronavirus/|title=March 24 Update on NASA Response to Coronavirus \u2013 Administrator Jim Bridenstine|website=blogs.nasa.gov|access-date=2020-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325035806/https://blogs.nasa.gov/bridenstine/2020/03/24/march-24-update-on-nasa-response-to-coronavirus/|archive-date=2020-03-25|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====Companies====\nSmall aerospace companies such as [[Bigelow Aerospace]] have collapsed as a result of the pandemic.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://spacenews.com/bigelow-aerospace-lays-off-entire-workforce/|title=Bigelow Aerospace lays off entire workforce|date=March 23, 2020|website=SpaceNews.com}}</ref> Larger companies such as [[SpaceX]] and [[Boeing]] remain somewhat economically unaffected, apart from extra safety precautions and measures for their employees to limit the spread of the virus in their workplaces.\n\n===Europe===\nThe [[European Space Agency]] has ordered many of its science and technology facilities' workforce to also telework as much as possible.\n\nRecent developments, including strengthened restrictions by national, regional and local authorities across Europe and the first positive test result for COVID-19 within the workforce at the [[European Space Operations Centre]], have led the agency to restrict on-site personnel at its mission control centres even further.\n\nESA's Director of Operations - Rolf Densing, has strongly recommended mission personnel to reduce activity of scientific missions, especially on interplanetary spacecraft.\n\nThe affected spacecraft are currently in stable orbits and long mission durations, so turning off their science instruments and placing them into a largely unattended safe configuration for a certain period will have a negligible impact on their overall mission performance.\n\nAmong the affected missions are:\n\n*[[Cluster II (spacecraft)|Cluster]] \u2013 A four-spacecraft mission launched in 2000, orbiting Earth to investigate our planet's magnetic environment and how it is forged by the solar wind, the stream of charged particles constantly released by the Sun;\n*[[ExoMars]] Trace Gas Orbiter \u2013 Launched in 2016, the spacecraft is in orbit around Mars, where it has been investigating the planet's atmosphere and providing data relay for landers on the surface;\n*[[Mars Express]] \u2013 Launched in 2003, the workhorse orbiter has been imaging the Martian surface and sampling the planet's atmosphere for over one and a half decades;\n*[[Solar Orbiter]] \u2013 ESA's newest science mission, launched in February 2020 and currently en route to its science operations orbit around the Sun.\n\nESA's Director of Science - G\u00fcnther Hasinger, commented: \u201cIt was a difficult decision, but the right one to take. Our greatest responsibility is the safety of people, and I know all of us in the science community understand why this is necessary\".\n\nThe temporary reduction in personnel on site will also allow the ESOC teams to concentrate on maintaining spacecraft safety for all other missions involved, in particular, the Mercury explorer [[BepiColombo]], which is on its way to the innermost planet in the [[Solar System]] and will require some on-site support around its scheduled Earth flyby on 10 April.\n\nThe challenging manoeuvre, which will use Earth's gravity to adjust BepiColombo's trajectory as it cruises towards Mercury, will be performed by a very small number of engineers and in full respect of social distancing and other health and hygiene measures required by the current situation. Commissioning and first check-out operations of scientific instruments on the recently launched Solar Orbiter, which had begun last month, have been temporarily suspended.\n\nESA expects to resume these operations in the near future, in line with the development of the coronavirus situation. Meanwhile, Solar Orbiter will continue its journey towards the Sun, with the first Venus flyby to take place in December.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/ESA_scales_down_science_mission_operations_amid_pandemic|title=ESA scales down science mission operations amid pandemic|website=esa.int|access-date=2020-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200324133913/http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/ESA_scales_down_science_mission_operations_amid_pandemic|archive-date=2020-03-24|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\n[[JAXA]] space and science operations largely remain unaffected.
