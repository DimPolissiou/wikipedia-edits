Memory deficits, age-related memory loss, and people's want to improve their own memory has lead to research on how to best help people to improve their memory. Research has also worked to determine what factors influence memory and cognition. Many different techniques to improve memory have been found, including [[cognitive training]], [[Psychopharmacology|psychopharmacology,]] [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[stress management]], and [[exercise]]. Each technique has the ability to influence memory in a different ways. [[Neuroimaging]] has also provided [[Neuroscience|neurobiological]] evidence supporting [[Holism|holistic]] ways in which one can improve memory.\n\n==Memory function factors==\n\n=== Neuroplasticity===\n[[Neuroplasticity]] is the mechanism by which the brain encodes experience, learns new behaviours and relearns lost behaviour if the brain has been damaged.<ref name=\"Kleim\">Kleim, JA., & Jones, TA.

[[London]] [[taxicab]] drivers provide a great example of this dynamic. They undergo extensive training for 2\u20134 years, learning and memorizing street names, layout of streets within the city and the quickest cross-city routes.  After studying London taxicab drivers over a period of time, it was found that the [[grey matter]] volume increased over time in the posterior [[hippocampus]], an area in the brain involved heavily in memory. The longer taxi drivers navigated the streets of London, the greater the posterior hippocampal gray matter volume.  This suggests a correlation between a healthy person's mental training or exercise and their brains capacity to manage greater volume and more complex information. The increase in volume actually led to a decrease in the taxi drivers' ability to acquire new visuo-spatial information.<ref name=\"Maguire\">Maguire, EA., Woollett, K., & Spiers, HJ. (2006).

In one experiment, the goal was to prove that cognitive training would increase the cognitive functions in older adults by using three types of training (memory, reasoning and speed of processing). It was found that improvements in cognitive ability not only was maintained over time but had a positive transfer effect on everyday functioning. Therefore, these results indicate that each type of cognitive training can produce immediate and lasting improvements in each kind of cognitive ability, thus suggesting that training can be beneficial to improving memory.<ref name=\"Willis\">Willis, SL., Tennstedt, SL., Marsiske, M., Ball, K., Elias, J., Koepke, KM., Morris, JN., Rebok, GW., Unverzagt, FW., Stoddard, AM., & Wright, E.

National Institutes of Health, 296(23), 2805-2814.</ref>\n\nCognitive training in areas other than memory has actually been seen to generalize and transfer to memory systems. For example, the Improvement in Memory with Plasticity-based Adaptive Cognitive Training (IMPACT) study by the [[American Geriatrics Society]] in 2009 demonstrated that cognitive training designed to improve accuracy and speed of the [[auditory system]] presented improvements in memory and attention system functioning as well as auditory functioning.<ref>Smith, G.E., Housen, P., Yaffe, K., Ruff, R., Kennison, R.F., Mahncke, H.W., Zelinski, E.M. (2009).

The American Geriatrics Society.</ref>\n[[File:Brain animated color nevit.gif|thumb|Human Brain]]\nTwo cognitive training methods are:\n\n* '''Strategy training''' is used to help individuals remember increasing amounts of information of a particular type. It involves teaching effective approaches to [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]], [[Working memory#Neural maintenance|maintenance]], and/or [[Recall (memory)|recall]] from working memory. The main goal of strategy training is to increase performance in tasks requiring retention of information. Studies strongly support the claim that the amount of information remembered can be increased by rehearsing out loud, telling a story with stimuli, or using imagery to make stimuli stand out. Strategy training has been used in children with [[Down syndrome]] and also in older adult populations.<ref name=\"Morrison\"/>\n* '''Core training''' involves repetition of demanding working memory tasks.  Some core training programs involve a combination of several tasks with widely varying stimulus types. The diversity of exercises increase the chance that one of, or some combination of the training tasks, will produce desired training-related gains. A goal of cognitive training is to impact the ease and success of cognitive performance in one's daily life. Core training can reduce the symptoms of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and improve the quality of life involving patients with [[multiple sclerosis]], [[schizophrenia]] and also, those who have suffered from [[stroke]].<ref name=\"Morrison\"/>\n\nThe manner in which a training study is conducted could affect the outcomes or perspection of the outcomes. Expectancy/effort effects occur when the experimenter subconsciously influences the participants to perform a desired result. One form of [[expectancy bias]] relates to [[placebo]] effects, which is the belief that training should have a positive influence on cognition.  A [[Treatment group|control group]] may help to eliminate this bias because this group would not expect to benefit from the training.  Researchers sometimes generalize their results, which can be misleading and incorrect.  An example is to generalize findings of a single task and interpret the observed improvements as a broadly defined cognitive ability.  The study may result in inconsistency if there are a variety of comparison groups used in working memory training, which is impacted by: training and assessment timeline, assessment conditions, training setting and control group selection.<ref name=\"Morrison\"/>\n\nThe Five x Five System is a set of memory enhancement tools that are scientifically validated. The system was created by Dr Peter Marshall for research purposes at Royal Holloway, University of London. The system involves 5 groups of 5 tactics designed to maximise storage and recall at each stage of the process of registering, short-term storage, long-term storage, consolidation and retrieval and was designed to test efficacy of including memory training in school curricula.  Each section is of equal text length so that it can be taught verbatim in the same amount of time by all competent teachers.<ref>Marshall, P (2012) Improving Your Memory: The Unique 5 x 5 System, Bexley-on-Sea: Oakley Books {{ISBN|978-0-9569784-6-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Personal Application & Intellectual Conception ===\n'''[[Testing effect|Testing Effect]]''' is when most of the learning is allocated to declarative knowledge [[Long-term memory|long term memory]] is enhanced, this is otherwise known as the testing effect .<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Memory|last=Baddeley, Alan D., 1934-|date=2009|publisher=Psychology Press|others=Eysenck, Michael W., Anderson, Michael C.

The longer taxi drivers navigated the streets of London, the greater the posterior hippocampal gray matter volume.

For example, the Improvement in Memory with Plasticity-based Adaptive Cognitive Training (IMPACT) study by the [[American Geriatrics Society]] in 2009 demonstrated that cognitive training designed to improve accuracy and speed of the [[auditory system]] presented improvements in memory and attention system functioning as well as auditory functioning.<ref>Smith, G.E., Housen, P., Yaffe, K., Ruff, R., Kennison, R.F., Mahncke, H.W., Zelinski, E.M.

The American Geriatrics Society.</ref>\n[[File:Brain animated color nevit.gif|thumb|Human Brain]]\nTwo cognitive training methods are:\n\n* '''Strategy training''' is used to help individuals remember increasing amounts of information of a particular type. It involves teaching effective approaches to [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]], [[Working memory#Neural maintenance|maintenance]], and/or [[Recall (memory)|recall]] from working memory. The main goal of strategy training is to increase performance in tasks requiring retention of information. Studies strongly support the claim that the amount of information remembered can be increased by rehearsing out loud, telling a story with stimuli, or using imagery to make stimuli stand out. Strategy training has been used in children with [[Down syndrome]] and also in older adult populations.<ref name=\"Morrison\"/>\n* '''Core training''' involves repetition of demanding working memory tasks.  Some core training programs involve a combination of several tasks with widely varying stimulus types. The diversity of exercises increase the chance that one of, or some combination of the training tasks, will produce desired training-related gains. A goal of cognitive training is to impact the ease and success of cognitive performance in one's daily life. Core training can reduce the symptoms of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) and improve the quality of life involving patients with [[multiple sclerosis]], [[schizophrenia]] and also, those who have suffered from [[stroke]].<ref name=\"Morrison\"/>\n\nThe manner in which a training study is conducted could affect the outcomes or perspection of the outcomes. Expectancy/effort effects occur when the experimenter subconsciously influences the participants to perform a desired result. One form of [[expectancy bias]] relates to [[placebo]] effects, which is the belief that training should have a positive influence on cognition.  A [[Treatment group|control group]] may help to eliminate this bias because this group would not expect to benefit from the training.  Researchers sometimes generalize their results, which can be misleading and incorrect.  An example is to generalize findings of a single task and interpret the observed improvements as a broadly defined cognitive ability.  The study may result in inconsistency if there are a variety of comparison groups used in working memory training, which is impacted by: training and assessment timeline, assessment conditions, training setting and control group selection.<ref name=\"Morrison\"/>\n\nThe Five x Five System is a set of memory enhancement tools that are scientifically validated.

However, in 1942 when the [[Indian National Congress]] launched a [[Quit India]] movement, the British authorities immediately arrested tens of thousands of activists.

However, in 1942 when the [[Indian National Congress]] launched a [[Quit India]] movement, the British authorities immediately arrested tens of thousands of activists.

India had also agreed to cut special regulations on trading [[carbonated drinks]], many [[Pharmaceutical drug|medicinal drugs]], and lowering regulations on many imports that are not of an [[agricultural nature]]. Both nations have agreed to discuss improved facets of Indian regulation in the trade of [[jewellery]], [[computer parts]], [[motorcycles]], [[fertiliser]], and those tariffs that affect American exporting of [[boric acid]]. The group has also discussed matters such as those wishing to break into the accounting market, [[Indian companies]] gaining licenses for the [[telecommunications]] industry, and setting policies regarding [[Indian media]] and [[broadcasting]] markets. Other foci include the exchange of valuable information on recognizing different professional services, discussing the movement and positioning of people in developing industries, continuation of talks on financial services markets, limitation of equities, insurance, retail, joint investment in agricultural processing and transportation industries, and small business initiatives.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category|Relations of India and the United States}}\n{{Portal|India|United States|Politics}}\n* [[Indian Americans]]\n* [[Americans in India]]\n* [[Quadrilateral Security Dialogue]]\n* [[Foreign relations of the United States]]\n* [[Foreign relations of India]]\n* [[India as an emerging superpower]]\n* [[India\u2013United States Civil Nuclear Agreement]]\n*[[Sikhism in the United States]]\n* [[Buddhism in the United States]]\n* [[Hinduism in the United States]]\n* [[India\u2013European Union relations]]\n* [[Canada\u2013India relations]]\n* [[Indians in the New York City metropolitan region]]\n* [[Next Steps in Strategic Partnership]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Refbegin|40em}}\n* Aspen Institute India.
