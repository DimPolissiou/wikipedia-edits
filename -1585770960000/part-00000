From [[2011 in radio|2011]] until its merger with [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]], it controlled many of the radio assets formerly belonging to the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), which was broken up in 2007; Cumulus owned the portion of the network that was purchased by [[Citadel Broadcasting]] that year.\n\nThe network adopted its final name in September 2011, following Cumulus's acquisition of Citadel; prior to this, it had been known as '''Citadel Media Networks''' since April 2009, after licensing the \"'''ABC Radio Networks'''\" name from [[The Walt Disney Company]] for nearly two years. ABC now operates a revived [[ABC Radio (United States)|ABC Radio Network]] that owns no stations but produces mostly short-form audio content.\n\nIt was also (as ABC Radio Networks) the penultimate of the major radio networks to still be owned by its original founding company until 2007, [[CBS Radio]] being the last. [[Mutual Broadcasting Network]] was dissolved in 1999, and then [[NBC Radio Network]], after selling all of its stations in 1988, followed suit in 2004.\n\nProminent hosts carried by Cumulus Media Networks included [[Don Imus]], [[Geraldo Rivera]], [[Mike Huckabee]], [[Mark Levin]], [[Michael Savage]], [[Jim Brickman]], Adam Bomb,  [[Kix Brooks]] ([[American Country Countdown]]), and [[Tom Kent]].\n\n==History==\nCumulus Media Networks had its origins in an early network set up by WJZ (now [[WABC (AM)|WABC]]) in [[New York City]] which provided programs to other stations over [[Western Union]] lines.\n\n===WJZ/NBC Blue Network===\n{{main|Blue Network}}\nWJZ (which is not related to [[WJZ-TV|the Baltimore TV station that currently uses those call letters]]), originally owned by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] and its informal network were absorbed into the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] in 1927. To the parent company [[Radio Corporation of America]], WJZ and affiliates were known as the '''[[Blue Network]]''' while New York station WEAF (later [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] and now [[WFAN]]) and its affiliates (also absorbed into NBC) were known as the \"Red Network.\" On the air, both were identified as \"NBC, the National Broadcasting Company;\" the distinctions between the two networks were, beyond staff and advertisers, mostly a matter of the more popular and established programming appearing on NBC Red.\n\nBoth NBC networks were owned by RCA; following a [[Federal Communications Commission]] investigation into the network's influence over advertising, strict ownership rules were introduced in 1941. RCA was compelled to sell one network and three local stations.\n\n===ABC Radio===\n{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}\n[[File:ABC Radio Networks logo.png|Former ABC Radio Networks Logo used until 2009|right|thumb]]RCA put an asking price of $8 million on the Blue network; after two years on the market, it was sold in 1943 to businessman [[Edward J. Noble]], owner of [[Life Savers]] candy and the [[Rexall Drug]] store chain, for the asking price.  After Noble took over, the network identified itself on-air as \"The Blue Network.\" It was officially renamed the ''American Broadcasting Company, Inc.'' in June 1945 after the company bought the rights to the name from (what would later become) [[Storer Broadcasting]].\n\nWith about 65 affiliates, ABC began with few of the big names and popular shows the other networks offered, so counter-programming became an ABC specialty. Industry policy had been to forbid taped or pre-recorded programs; ABC lured some big-name stars by adapting the tape technology developed in World War II. To add to its programming, ABC bought stations KECA (now [[KABC (AM)|KABC]]) in [[Los Angeles]] and WXYZ (now [[WXYT (AM)|WXYT]]) in [[Detroit]], the latter home and originator of many popular serials such as ''[[The Lone Ranger]]''.\n\nFinancially unable to match the larger networks, ABC merged with [[United Paramount Theaters]] early in 1953.<ref>The New York Times, February 10, 1953</ref>  Through the 1950s, network radio declined in popularity, and ABC radio gradually became more oriented to its local stations, especially its two pop-music powerhouses, New York's WABC (formerly WJZ) and Chicago's [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] (which was owned and operated by the ''[[Prairie Farmer]]'' in a time-share arrangement with ABC-owned WENR until both stations merged in 1954; ABC acquired the ''Farmer's'' minority stake in 1959).\n\nSome network programs held on into the television era:  ''[[Don McNeill's Breakfast Club]]'', one of the first and longest-running morning shows in the country, hosted by [[Don McNeill (performer)|Don McNeill]], ran from 1933 to 1968. Other long-running ABC programs included the ''[[National Barn Dance]]'', running from 1924 to 1960, and [[Paul Harvey]]'s daily commentary, which ran from 1951 until his death in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wlshistory.com|title=The History of WLS Radio!|author=|date=|website=www.wlshistory.com}}</ref>  In 1958, ABC collaborated with its sister television network to produce the first national [[stereophonic sound]] broadcasts, when it simulcast ''The Plymouth Show'' (one of [[The Lawrence Welk Show|two shows]] hosted by [[Lawrence Welk]] at the time); the TV side broadcast one audio channel and the radio side broadcast the other in synchronization; viewers had to tune into both devices to achieve the stereophonic effect.\n\n====John F. Kennedy assassination bulletin====\nABC Radio broadcast the first nationwide report of the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]]. Kennedy was shot in a motorcade in [[Dallas, Texas]] at 18:30 [[UTC]] on November 22, 1963 and ABC Radio's Don Gardiner anchored the network's initial bulletin at 18:36:50 UTC, minutes before any other radio or television network did the same.\n\nA surviving [[aircheck]] from New York shortwave station [[WNYW (shortwave)|WRUL]] includes the first ABC Radio bulletin. Gardiner interrupts [[Doris Day]]'s recording of \"[[Hooray for Hollywood]]\" to tell listeners at 13:36:50 EST (UTC\u22125):\n\n{{cquote|We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin from ABC Radio.

He felt that there was more product than stations could broadcast, causing a sale issue. The four separate networks would allow advertisers to better market to their preferred audience. Paul Harvey and the Breakfast Club were designated as Entertainment network features.<ref name=bc>{{cite news|title=600 stations set for new ABC|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1968/1968-01-01-BC.pdf|accessdate=June 7, 2016|work=Broadcasting|date=January 1, 1968|pages=42\u201344|format=PDF}}</ref> Before the split, ABC obtained a waiver of the FCC's \"Chain Broadcasting\" rule on December 29, 1967, which had forced the sale of the Blue network in 1943. Though each of the four new networks were carried on the same 5&nbsp;kHz telco line (3.5 in some cities), the move allowed ABC to have as many as four affiliates in one city \u2013 a major competitive advantage and a dramatic turning point in the history of network radio.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} However, the FCC insisted that there be no overlap of any ABC network broadcast in a single market, and the network required affiliates to get approval before any delayed broadcast of network programming.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC Radio plans get FCC's qualified OK|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1968/1968-01-01-BC.pdf|accessdate=June 7, 2016|work=Broadcasting|date=January 1, 1968|pages=44\u201345|format=PDF}}</ref> The new networks were launched on January 1, 1968.<ref name=bc/>\n\nTwo additional networks, ABC Rock Network and ABC Direction Network were added on January 4, 1982.

Kasem left ABC in 1988, reclaiming the ''American Top 40'' name from ABC in 1998, and selling the AT40 brand to AMFM Radio Networks (later absorbed intro [[Premiere Radio Networks]]). Kingsley left ABC in 2005 and 'ACC' continues to air as part of the ABC stable with [[Kix Brooks]] as host since 2006. [[Dick Bartley]] joined the network in 1991 with the AT40 spinoff ''[[Classic Countdown|American Gold]]'' and his live Saturday night call-in oldies show, before leaving at the end of March 2009.\n\nABC launched a foray into [[talk radio]] with ''ABC Talk Radio'' (similar to rival NBC's [[NBC Talknet|Talknet]]) in the 1980s. Among its most notable hosts were [[Tom Snyder]] and [[Barry Farber]]. However, the rising popularity of conservative political talk radio, fueled by ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'', led to the network's demise. After Snyder's retirement in 1992, ABC ostensibly filled the slot with [[Leslie Marshall (journalist)|Leslie Marshall]], at the time the youngest syndicated host ever, but most major affiliates instead picked up Limbaugh. The network was shut down shortly thereafter, though one program from that network, [[Bob Brinker]]'s ''Moneytalk'' is now in its twenty-fifth year nationwide.\n\nABC acquired the [[Satellite Music Network]], the first satellite-delivered music radio network, and its nine channels of programming in 1989.

Among the first hosts heard on the new ABC talk network were [[Sam Donaldson]] of [[ABC News]] television, [[Sean Hannity]] of WABC, [[Larry Elder]] of KABC, and [[John Batchelor]] of WABC. Donaldson left his show after a short time. [[Mark Levin]] was added in 2005 and eventually replaced Elder in 2007, and [[Mark Davis (talk show host)|Mark Davis]] of WBAP had a brief syndication run on the network in 2005. Hannity has been the most successful, displacing [[Laura Schlessinger]] as the most popular host in the time slot within a few years (especially on the East Coast); the network shared the program with [[Premiere Radio Networks]] from 2008 to 2013 before Premiere took over the program entirely beginning in 2014.\n\n====Sale to Citadel====\nIn 2005, ABC began to explore the sale of its radio division. The two leading competitors for the purchase of the network, which included twenty-two of ABC Radio's top stations, as well as ABC's talk and music networks, were [[Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania|Bala Cynwyd]]-based [[Entercom Communications]] and [[Forstmann Little & Company]]'s [[Citadel Broadcasting Corporation|Citadel Broadcasting]] unit. Citadel was chosen as the top bidder and the deal to purchase the stations and the network was struck in February 2006.<ref name=\"wsj_citadel_abc\">\"Citadel to Buy Most of Disney Radio Assets,\" ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', February 6, 2006.</ref> The deal did not include [[Radio Disney]], [[ESPN Radio]] (or its Spanish counterpart [[ESPN Deportes Radio]]), any of the five ESPN Radio stations (or the myriad of Radio Disney stations) Disney owned at the time, or any of ABC's television assets (the ABC name, which also remained in Disney's hands, would be licensed to Citadel for two years).

To this day, the division, known as \"Westwood One Music Radio\" (formerly \"Citadel Music Radio\" and \"ABC Music Radio\"), provides 10 satellite-driven formats to affiliate stations, mostly in small & mid-size [[Media market|markets]] and on major market [[HD Radio]] subchannels. However they can also be used on some major market stations as alternative or permanent programming. They could operate their stations virtually unmanned with nothing more than a [[computer]] and a satellite hookup offering major market talent that some radio stations could never afford. The \"clock\" included options for a 2-, 3-, or 5-minute [[News broadcasting|newscasts]] at the top of the hour, followed by other holes for local spots. While some of the programming is [[Live radio|live]] (some is done by [[voice tracking]]), DJ's had to avoid references to the [[weather]] or anything else that would not be appropriate in many [[time zone]]s (time reports, for instance, were given only in minutes before or after \"the hour\"). An 800-line was eventually added, allowing the live DJ's to take phoned in requests.

From [[2011 in radio|2011]] until its merger with [[Westwood One (current)|Westwood One]], it controlled many of the radio assets formerly belonging to the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC), which was broken up in 2007; Cumulus owned the portion of the network that was purchased by [[Citadel Broadcasting]] that year.\n\nThe network adopted its final name in September 2011, following Cumulus's acquisition of Citadel; prior to this, it had been known as '''Citadel Media Networks''' since April 2009, after licensing the \"'''ABC Radio Networks'''\" name from [[The Walt Disney Company]] for nearly two years. ABC now operates a revived [[ABC Radio (United States)|ABC Radio Network]] that owns no stations but produces mostly short-form audio content.\n\nIt was also (as ABC Radio Networks) the penultimate of the major radio networks to still be owned by its original founding company until 2007, [[CBS Radio]] being the last. [[Mutual Broadcasting Network]] was dissolved in 1999, and then [[NBC Radio Network]], after selling all of its stations in 1988, followed suit in 2004.\n\nProminent hosts carried by Cumulus Media Networks included [[Don Imus]], [[Geraldo Rivera]], [[Mike Huckabee]], [[Mark Levin]], [[Michael Savage]], [[Jim Brickman]], Adam Bomb,  [[Kix Brooks]] ([[American Country Countdown]]), and [[Tom Kent]].\n\n==History==\nCumulus Media Networks had its origins in an early network set up by WJZ (now [[WABC (AM)|WABC]]) in [[New York City]] which provided programs to other stations over [[Western Union]] lines.\n\n===WJZ/NBC Blue Network===\n{{main|Blue Network}}\nWJZ (which is not related to [[WJZ-TV|the Baltimore TV station that currently uses those call letters]]), originally owned by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] and its informal network were absorbed into the [[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] in 1927. To the parent company [[Radio Corporation of America]], WJZ and affiliates were known as the '''[[Blue Network]]''' while New York station WEAF (later [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] and now [[WFAN]]) and its affiliates (also absorbed into NBC) were known as the \"Red Network.\" On the air, both were identified as \"NBC, the National Broadcasting Company;\" the distinctions between the two networks were, beyond staff and advertisers, mostly a matter of the more popular and established programming appearing on NBC Red.\n\nBoth NBC networks were owned by RCA; following a [[Federal Communications Commission]] investigation into the network's influence over advertising, strict ownership rules were introduced in 1941. RCA was compelled to sell one network and three local stations.\n\n===ABC Radio===\n{{Expand section|date=March 2011}}\n[[File:ABC Radio Networks logo.png|Former ABC Radio Networks Logo used until 2009|right|thumb]]RCA put an asking price of $8 million on the Blue network; after two years on the market, it was sold in 1943 to businessman [[Edward J. Noble]], owner of [[Life Savers]] candy and the [[Rexall Drug]] store chain, for the asking price.  After Noble took over, the network identified itself on-air as \"The Blue Network.\" It was officially renamed the ''American Broadcasting Company, Inc.'' in June 1945 after the company bought the rights to the name from (what would later become) [[Storer Broadcasting]].\n\nWith about 65 affiliates, ABC began with few of the big names and popular shows the other networks offered, so counter-programming became an ABC specialty. Industry policy had been to forbid taped or pre-recorded programs; ABC lured some big-name stars by adapting the tape technology developed in World War II. To add to its programming, ABC bought stations KECA (now [[KABC (AM)|KABC]]) in [[Los Angeles]] and WXYZ (now [[WXYT (AM)|WXYT]]) in [[Detroit]], the latter home and originator of many popular serials such as ''[[The Lone Ranger]]''.\n\nFinancially unable to match the larger networks, ABC merged with [[United Paramount Theaters]] early in 1953.<ref>The New York Times, February 10, 1953</ref>  Through the 1950s, network radio declined in popularity, and ABC radio gradually became more oriented to its local stations, especially its two pop-music powerhouses, New York's WABC (formerly WJZ) and Chicago's [[WLS (AM)|WLS]] (which was owned and operated by the ''[[Prairie Farmer]]'' in a time-share arrangement with ABC-owned WENR until both stations merged in 1954; ABC acquired the ''Farmer's'' minority stake in 1959).\n\nSome network programs held on into the television era:  ''[[Don McNeill's Breakfast Club]]'', one of the first and longest-running morning shows in the country, hosted by [[Don McNeill (performer)|Don McNeill]], ran from 1933 to 1968. Other long-running ABC programs included the ''[[National Barn Dance]]'', running from 1924 to 1960, and [[Paul Harvey]]'s daily commentary, which ran from 1951 until his death in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wlshistory.com|title=The History of WLS Radio!|author=|date=|website=www.wlshistory.com}}</ref>  In 1958, ABC collaborated with its sister television network to produce the first national [[stereophonic sound]] broadcasts, when it simulcast ''The Plymouth Show'' (one of [[The Lawrence Welk Show|two shows]] hosted by [[Lawrence Welk]] at the time); the TV side broadcast one audio channel and the radio side broadcast the other in synchronization; viewers had to tune into both devices to achieve the stereophonic effect.\n\n====John F. Kennedy assassination bulletin====\nABC Radio broadcast the first nationwide report of the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]]. Kennedy was shot in a motorcade in [[Dallas, Texas]] at 18:30 [[UTC]] on November 22, 1963 and ABC Radio's Don Gardiner anchored the network's initial bulletin at 18:36:50 UTC, minutes before any other radio or television network did the same.\n\nA surviving [[aircheck]] from New York shortwave station [[WNYW (shortwave)|WRUL]] includes the first ABC Radio bulletin. Gardiner interrupts [[Doris Day]]'s recording of \"[[Hooray for Hollywood]]\" to tell listeners at 13:36:50 EST (UTC\u22125):\n\n{{cquote|We interrupt this program to bring you a special bulletin from ABC Radio.

He felt that there was more product than stations could broadcast, causing a sale issue. The four separate networks would allow advertisers to better market to their preferred audience. Paul Harvey and the Breakfast Club were designated as Entertainment network features.<ref name=bc>{{cite news|title=600 stations set for new ABC|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1968/1968-01-01-BC.pdf|accessdate=June 7, 2016|work=Broadcasting|date=January 1, 1968|pages=42\u201344|format=PDF}}</ref> Before the split, ABC obtained a waiver of the FCC's \"Chain Broadcasting\" rule on December 29, 1967, which had forced the sale of the Blue network in 1943. Though each of the four new networks were carried on the same 5&nbsp;kHz telco line (3.5 in some cities), the move allowed ABC to have as many as four affiliates in one city \u2013 a major competitive advantage and a dramatic turning point in the history of network radio.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}} However, the FCC insisted that there be no overlap of any ABC network broadcast in a single market, and the network required affiliates to get approval before any delayed broadcast of network programming.<ref>{{cite news|title=ABC Radio plans get FCC's qualified OK|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1968/1968-01-01-BC.pdf|accessdate=June 7, 2016|work=Broadcasting|date=January 1, 1968|pages=44\u201345|format=PDF}}</ref> The new networks were launched on January 1, 1968.<ref name=bc/>\n\nTwo additional networks, ABC Rock Network and ABC Direction Network were added on January 4, 1982. ABC Rock's anchor affiliate was [[WPLJ]] in New York City and had many [[Album-oriented rock]] formatted station move from American FM Network with a total of 40 affiliates. Executives in charge of ABC Rock at launch were vice president Tom Plant and program director Denise Oliver. The Direction Network was under ABC Entertainment Network's executive's charge and was for adult (25-45) formats stations and started with 57 affiliates.<ref>{{cite news|title=New  Lineups  For  ABC  Networks |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/80s/1982/BB-1982-01-16.pdf|accessdate=June 7, 2016|work=Billboard|date=January 16, 1982|page=21}}</ref>\n\nABC Radio acquired [[Watermark Inc.]], best known as the syndicator of [[American Top 40]] with [[Casey Kasem]] and American Country Countdown with [[Bob Kingsley]], in 1982. Kasem left ABC in 1988, reclaiming the ''American Top 40'' name from ABC in 1998, and selling the AT40 brand to AMFM Radio Networks (later absorbed intro [[Premiere Radio Networks]]). Kingsley left ABC in 2005 and 'ACC' continues to air as part of the ABC stable with [[Kix Brooks]] as host since 2006. [[Dick Bartley]] joined the network in 1991 with the AT40 spinoff ''[[Classic Countdown|American Gold]]'' and his live Saturday night call-in oldies show, before leaving at the end of March 2009.\n\nABC launched a foray into [[talk radio]] with ''ABC Talk Radio'' (similar to rival NBC's [[NBC Talknet|Talknet]]) in the 1980s. Among its most notable hosts were [[Tom Snyder]] and [[Barry Farber]]. However, the rising popularity of conservative political talk radio, fueled by ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'', led to the network's demise. After Snyder's retirement in 1992, ABC ostensibly filled the slot with [[Leslie Marshall (journalist)|Leslie Marshall]], at the time the youngest syndicated host ever, but most major affiliates instead picked up Limbaugh. The network was shut down shortly thereafter, though one program from that network, [[Bob Brinker]]'s ''Moneytalk'' is now in its twenty-fifth year nationwide.\n\nABC acquired the [[Satellite Music Network]], the first satellite-delivered music radio network, and its nine channels of programming in 1989. The division continues to operate semi-autonomously as Cumulus Music Radio at Cumulus's Dallas-Fort Worth cluster.\n\n[[ESPN Radio|ESPN Radio Network]] was formed in September 1991 by both [[ESPN, Inc.]] and [[Capital Cities/ABC]], Inc.'s ABC Radio Networks<ref name=lat>{{cite news|title=ESPN, ABC Planning to Form Sports Radio Network in 1992|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-09-05/sports/sp-2364_1_radio-network|accessdate=June 7, 2016|work=Lso Angeles Times|agency=Associated Press|date=September 5, 1991}}</ref> and launched as Sports Radio ESPN on January 1, 1992.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Zumoff|first1=Marc|last2=Negin|first2=Max|title=Total Sportscasting: Performance, Production, and Career Development|date=June 20, 2014|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1317906764|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3qTcAwAAQBAJ&lpg=PT55&dq=SportsRadio%20ESPN%201992&pg=PT55#v=onepage&q=SportsRadio%20ESPN%201992&f=false|accessdate=June 7, 2016}}</ref> [[Radio Disney]] was test launched in November 1996 in four markets by ABC Radio Networks with a Los Angeles station added on August 26, 1997.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hochman|first1=Steve|title=Radio Disney Makes L.A.

Among the first hosts heard on the new ABC talk network were [[Sam Donaldson]] of [[ABC News]] television, [[Sean Hannity]] of WABC, [[Larry Elder]] of KABC, and [[John Batchelor]] of WABC. Donaldson left his show after a short time. [[Mark Levin]] was added in 2005 and eventually replaced Elder in 2007, and [[Mark Davis (talk show host)|Mark Davis]] of WBAP had a brief syndication run on the network in 2005. Hannity has been the most successful, displacing [[Laura Schlessinger]] as the most popular host in the time slot within a few years (especially on the East Coast); the network shared the program with [[Premiere Radio Networks]] from 2008 to 2013 before Premiere took over the program entirely beginning in 2014.\n\n====Sale to Citadel====\nIn 2005, ABC began to explore the sale of its radio division. The two leading competitors for the purchase of the network, which included twenty-two of ABC Radio's top stations, as well as ABC's talk and music networks, were [[Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania|Bala Cynwyd]]-based [[Entercom Communications]] and [[Forstmann Little & Company]]'s [[Citadel Broadcasting Corporation|Citadel Broadcasting]] unit. Citadel was chosen as the top bidder and the deal to purchase the stations and the network was struck in February 2006.<ref name=\"wsj_citadel_abc\">\"Citadel to Buy Most of Disney Radio Assets,\" ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', February 6, 2006.</ref> The deal did not include [[Radio Disney]], [[ESPN Radio]] (or its Spanish counterpart [[ESPN Deportes Radio]]), any of the five ESPN Radio stations (or the myriad of Radio Disney stations) Disney owned at the time, or any of ABC's television assets (the ABC name, which also remained in Disney's hands, would be licensed to Citadel for two years).

Cumulus paid $260 million in cash for this programming syndication service, part of which has paid off Dial's debt before it was folded into this network service. Cumulus funded the sale by making a pair of station deals with [[Townsquare Media]].<ref>[http://www.radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/84851/are-these-the-markets-in-the-cumulustownsquaredial-global-deal/ Cumulus Makes Dial Global And Townsquare Deals Official] - ''[http://www.radioinsight.com Radio Insight] (released August 30, 2013)</ref>\n\nOn July 31, 2014, Cumulus acquired the rights to [[CNN]]\u2019s content to distribute to radio stations (the company had held CNN radio rights since its acquisition of Dial Global, but CNN had not produced any radio content since April 2012).

To this day, the division, known as \"Westwood One Music Radio\" (formerly \"Citadel Music Radio\" and \"ABC Music Radio\"), provides 10 satellite-driven formats to affiliate stations, mostly in small & mid-size [[Media market|markets]] and on major market [[HD Radio]] subchannels. However they can also be used on some major market stations as alternative or permanent programming. They could operate their stations virtually unmanned with nothing more than a [[computer]] and a satellite hookup offering major market talent that some radio stations could never afford. The \"clock\" included options for a 2-, 3-, or 5-minute [[News broadcasting|newscasts]] at the top of the hour, followed by other holes for local spots. While some of the programming is [[Live radio|live]] (some is done by [[voice tracking]]), DJ's had to avoid references to the [[weather]] or anything else that would not be appropriate in many [[time zone]]s (time reports, for instance, were given only in minutes before or after \"the hour\"). An 800-line was eventually added, allowing the live DJ's to take phoned in requests.

'''Weigel'''<ref>{{cite web |title=Weigel Broadcasting Co. {{!}} |url=http://www.weigelbroadcasting.com/about/ |website=www.weigelbroadcasting.com}}</ref>) is an [[United States|American]] [[television broadcasting]] company based in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], alongside its flagship station [[WCIU-TV]] (Channel 26), at 26 North [[Halsted Street]] in the [[Greektown, Chicago|Greektown]] neighborhood. It currently owns 19 television stations.\n\n== History ==\nThe company was founded by Chicago broadcasting veteran John Weigel, whose career dated back to the 1930s. With [[United States dollar|$]]1,000 of his own money, and another $1,000 from his attorney, Daniel J. McCarthy, Weigel bought the broadcasting license for what became the first [[UHF]] television station in the Chicago area. WCIU signed on the air on February 6, 1964. One year later, in 1965, the company was the subject of a successful hostile takeover at the hands of the Shapiro family.<ref>[http://chicagotelevision.com/weigel.htm John Weigel - Man of UHF], ''The Video Veteran/Chicago Television''</ref>\n\nOver the years, the company began to acquire and also launch new stations in the adjacent markets of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] and [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], at first by placing WCIU translators in those markets to gain a foothold in each market, before programming the stations independently. Weigel would end up an unexpected beneficiary of the [[1994\u20131996 United States broadcast TV realignment|television industry realignment of 1994-95]]. Full-power independent station [[WDJT-TV]] in Milwaukee, which had only signed on five years earlier, ended up with the CBS affiliation in late 1994. [[WBND-LD|WBND-LP]] became the home of ABC programming in South Bend the next year. In both cases, the longtime affiliates of the networks in those markets \u2014 [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] in Milwaukee and [[WSJV]] in South Bend \u2014 switched to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and the Weigel-owned stations secured 11th-hour affiliation deals after no other viable replacement affiliates surfaced.\n\nAlso in that same year, WCIU dropped the Spanish-language [[Univision]] network and became Chicago's only true full-power independent station when [[WGN-TV]] and [[WPWR-TV]] joined [[The WB]] and [[UPN]] networks respectively, while [[WGBO-TV]] became a Univision-owned station. These changes allowed WCIU to pursue sports rights and syndicated programming not previously available, ultimately giving WCIU some strength in the market.\n\nWeigel's [[MeTV]] format originated as a programming block that debuted on January 6, 2003 on television station [[WWME-CD|WFBT-CA]] (channel 23) in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] that otherwise featured an ethnic programming format.<ref name=cst-metvblock>{{cite news|title='ME-TV' joins 'The U' on Weigel's local menu|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1475452.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629120714/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1475452.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 29, 2014|author=[[Robert Feder]]|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|date=January 3, 2003|accessdate=August 31, 2012|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}} (preview of subscription content)</ref>\n\nIn April 2008, Weigel completed the purchase of WJJA-TV in [[Racine, Wisconsin]], which gave the company its second full-power station in the Milwaukee market.

'''Weigel'''<ref>{{cite web |title=Weigel Broadcasting Co. {{!}} |url=http://www.weigelbroadcasting.com/about/ |website=www.weigelbroadcasting.com}}</ref>) is an [[United States|American]] [[television broadcasting]] company based in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], alongside its flagship station [[WCIU-TV]] (Channel 26), at 26 North [[Halsted Street]] in the [[Greektown, Chicago|Greektown]] neighborhood. It currently owns 19 television stations.\n\n== History ==\nThe company was founded by Chicago broadcasting veteran John Weigel, whose career dated back to the 1930s. With [[United States dollar|$]]1,000 of his own money, and another $1,000 from his attorney, Daniel J. McCarthy, Weigel bought the broadcasting license for what became the first [[UHF]] television station in the Chicago area. WCIU signed on the air on February 6, 1964. One year later, in 1965, the company was the subject of a successful hostile takeover at the hands of the Shapiro family.<ref>[http://chicagotelevision.com/weigel.htm John Weigel - Man of UHF], ''The Video Veteran/Chicago Television''</ref>\n\nOver the years, the company began to acquire and also launch new stations in the adjacent markets of [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]] and [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]], at first by placing WCIU translators in those markets to gain a foothold in each market, before programming the stations independently. Weigel would end up an unexpected beneficiary of the [[1994\u20131996 United States broadcast TV realignment|television industry realignment of 1994-95]]. Full-power independent station [[WDJT-TV]] in Milwaukee, which had only signed on five years earlier, ended up with the CBS affiliation in late 1994. [[WBND-LD|WBND-LP]] became the home of ABC programming in South Bend the next year. In both cases, the longtime affiliates of the networks in those markets \u2014 [[WITI (TV)|WITI]] in Milwaukee and [[WSJV]] in South Bend \u2014 switched to [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and the Weigel-owned stations secured 11th-hour affiliation deals after no other viable replacement affiliates surfaced.\n\nAlso in that same year, WCIU dropped the Spanish-language [[Univision]] network and became Chicago's only true full-power independent station when [[WGN-TV]] and [[WPWR-TV]] joined [[The WB]] and [[UPN]] networks respectively, while [[WGBO-TV]] became a Univision-owned station. These changes allowed WCIU to pursue sports rights and syndicated programming not previously available, ultimately giving WCIU some strength in the market.\n\nWeigel's [[MeTV]] format originated as a programming block that debuted on January 6, 2003 on television station [[WWME-CD|WFBT-CA]] (channel 23) in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], an [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]] that otherwise featured an ethnic programming format.<ref name=cst-metvblock>{{cite news|title='ME-TV' joins 'The U' on Weigel's local menu|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1475452.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629120714/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1475452.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 29, 2014|author=[[Robert Feder]]|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]]|date=January 3, 2003|accessdate=August 31, 2012|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}} (preview of subscription content)</ref>\n\nIn April 2008, Weigel completed the purchase of WJJA-TV in [[Racine, Wisconsin]], which gave the company its second full-power station in the Milwaukee market.

It will air programs from the extensive library of [[CBS Television Distribution]], including archival footage from [[CBS News]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/news/local-tv/cbs-stations-weigel-partner-oldies-digi-net-decades/134996|title=CBS Stations, Weigel Partner on Oldies Digi-Net Decades|last=Malone|first=Michael|work=Broadcasting & Cable|publisher=NewBay Media|date=October 21, 2014|accessdate=October 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Weigel expands beyond the Great Lakes region===\nOn July 19, 2017, Weigel agreed to acquire [[Cedar City, Utah]] station [[KCSG]] for $1.1 million.<ref>[http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1761834&Service=DT&Form_id=314&Facility_id=59494 Application for consent to Assignment of Broadcast Station Construction Permit or License - Federal Communications Commission]</ref> The sale will convert the station in a H&I owned-and-operated station, though the possibility of Weigel's other networks being contained to it is also possible.
