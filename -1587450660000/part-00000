After being fired from the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] over an alleged relationship with one of his male students, he met [[Bonnie Nettles]], a 44-year-old married nurse with an interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and biblical prophecy, in March 1972.{{sfn|Goldwag|2009|p=77}} According to Applewhite's writings, the two met in a hospital where she worked while he was visiting a sick friend there. It has been rumored that it was a psychiatric hospital, but Nettles was substituting for another nurse working with premature babies in the nursery. {{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=111}} Applewhite later recalled that he felt like he had known Nettles for a long time and concluded that they had met in a past life.{{sfn|Lalich|2004|pp=44, 48}} She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]], persuading him that he had a divine assignment.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=210}}{{sfn|Lalich|2004|p=43}}\n\nApplewhite and Nettles pondered the life of [[St.&nbsp;Francis of Assisi]] and read works by authors including [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[R.&nbsp;D.

They published advertisements for meetings, where they recruited disciples, whom they called \"the crew\".{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=356}} At the events, they purported to represent beings from another planet, the Next Level, who sought participants for an experiment.

After selling all \"worldly\" possessions and saying farewell to loved ones, the group vanished from the hotel and from the public eye.{{sfn|Goldwag|2009|p=77}} That night on the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', [[Walter Cronkite]] reported that the group had disappeared, in one of the very first national reports on the developing religious group: \"A score of persons{{nbsp}}... have disappeared. It's a mystery whether they've been taken on a so-called trip to eternity\u2014or simply been taken.\"<ref name=\"laweekly2007\" /> In reality, Applewhite and Nettles had arranged for the group to go underground. From that point, \"Do and Ti\" (pronounced \"doe and tee\"), as the two now called themselves, led the nearly one-hundred-member crew across the country, sleeping in tents and sleeping bags and begging in the streets. Evading detection by the authorities and media enabled the group to focus on Do and Ti's doctrine of helping members of the crew achieve a \"higher evolutionary level\" above human, to which they claimed to have already reached.<ref name=\"laweekly2007\" />\n\nApplewhite and Nettles used a variety of [[Pseudonym|aliases]] over the years, notably \"[[Little Bo-Peep|Bo and Peep]]\" and \"[[Solf\u00e8ge|Do and Ti]]\". The group also had a variety of names\u2014prior to the adoption of the name Heaven's Gate (and at the time Vall\u00e9e studied the group), it was known as Human Individual Metamorphosis (HIM).

Some sociologists agree that the popular movement of alternative religious experience and individualism found in collective spiritual experiences during that period helped contribute to the growth of the new religious movement. \"Sheilaism\", as it became known, was a way for people to merge their diverse religious backgrounds and coalesce around a shared, generalized faith, which followers of new religious sects like Applewhite's crew found a very appetizing alternative to traditional dogmas in [[Judaism]], [[Catholicism]] and [[evangelical Christianity]]. Many of Applewhite and Nettle's crew hailed from these very diverse backgrounds; most of them are described by researchers as having been \"longtime truth-seekers\", or spiritual hippies who had long since believed in attempting to \"find themselves\" through spiritual means, combining faiths in a sort of cultural [[Social environment|milieu]] well into the mid-80s.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|pp= 59\u201365}}\nHowever, remarkably, many of those same researchers note that not all of Applewhite's crew were hippies recruited from [[far-left politics|far-left]] alternative religious backgrounds\u2014in fact, one such recruit early on was John Craig, a respected [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] running for the [[Colorado House of Representatives]] at the time of joining in 1975.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|pp= 65\u201366}} As recruit numbers grew in its pre-Internet days, the clan of \"UFO followers\" all seemed to have in common a need for communal belonging in an alternative path to higher existence without the constraints of institutionalized faith.\n\nIt was not until the death of Nettles in 1985 and Applewhite's subsequent revision of the group's doctrines that the crew gained an eventual reputation as a \"cyberculture\" form of religious thought reform;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.histarch.illinois.edu/harper/millenial5.html |title=Free Will, or Thought Control?; Were the Deaths of Heaven's Gate Members the Result of Brainwashing? |date=4 April 1997 |accessdate=2016-09-30 |work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> by the mid-90s, the group had become reclusive, identifying themselves using the business name \"Higher Source\", and using their website to proselytize and recruit followers.

After asserting that a spacecraft was trailing [[Comet Hale\u2013Bopp]] and that this event would represent the \"closure to Heaven's Gate\", Applewhite persuaded 38 followers to prepare for ritual suicide so their souls could board the supposed craft. Applewhite believed that after their deaths an [[unidentified flying object]] (UFO) would take their souls to another \"level of existence above human\", which he described as being both physical and spiritual. Their preparations included each member's videotaping a farewell message.\n\nTo kill themselves, members took [[phenobarbital]] mixed with apple sauce or pudding and washed it down with [[vodka]]. Additionally, they secured plastic bags around their heads after ingesting the mix to induce [[asphyxia]]tion. All 39 were dressed in identical black shirts and sweat pants, brand new black-and-white [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] Decades athletic shoes, and armband patches reading \"Heaven's Gate [[Away team (Star Trek term)|Away Team]]\" (one of many instances of the group's use of the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[fictional universe]]'s [[nomenclature]]). Each member had on their person a five-dollar bill and three quarters in their pockets: the five-dollar bill was to cover vagrancy fines while members were out on jobs, while the quarters were to make phone calls. Once dead, a living member would arrange the body by removing the plastic bag from the person's head. They then posed the body so that it lay neatly in their own bed, with faces and torsos covered by a square purple cloth for privacy. The identical clothing was used as a uniform for the mass suicide to represent unity whilst the Nike Decades were chosen as the group \"got a good deal on the shoes\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://alloutattacksports.wordpress.com/2020/01/20/5334/|title=Going to Heaven on a UFO\u2014an interview with Heaven's Gate cult members 22 years on|last=Robinson|first=Harry|date=20 January 2020|website=AllOutAttack|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe 39 adherents, 21 women and 18 men between the ages of 26 and 72, are believed to have died in three groups over three successive days, with remaining participants cleaning up after each prior group's deaths.<ref name=\":5\">{{cite news |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/heavens_gate/5.html |title=Death Mansion |last=Ramsland |first=Katherine |work=All about Heaven's Gate cult |accessdate=September 20, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211012614/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/heavens_gate/5.html |archivedate=2006-12-11 |publisher=[[CourtTV]] Crime Library |authorlink=Katherine Ramsland |quote=On Saturday{{nbsp}}...

Initially the group had been told that they would be transported with their bodies on board a spacecraft that would come to Earth and take the crew to heaven, referred to as the \"next level\". When Bonnie Lou Nettles (Ti) died of cancer in 1985, it confounded Applewhite's doctrine because Nettles was allegedly chosen by the next level to be a messenger on Earth, yet her body died instead of leaving physically to outer space. The belief system was then refined to include the leaving of consciousness from the body as equivalent to leaving the Earth in a spacecraft.\n\nWhile the group was against [[suicide]], they defined \"suicide\" in their own context to mean \"to turn against the Next Level when it is being offered\" and believed their \"human\" bodies were only vessels meant to help them on their journey. Suicide, therefore, would be ''not'' allowing their consciousness to leave their human bodies to join the next level; remaining alive instead of participating in the group suicide was considered suicide of their consciousness. In conversation, when referring to a person or a person's body, they routinely used the word \"vehicle\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Ramsland |first=Katherine |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/heavens_gate/4.html |title=The Heaven's Gate Cult: The Real End |website=[[Crime Library]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210050304/http://www.crimelibrary.com/notorious_murders/mass/heavens_gate/4.html |archivedate=February 10, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe members of the group added -ody to the first names they adopted in lieu of their original given names, which defines \"children of the Next Level\". This is mentioned in Applewhite's final video, ''Do's Final Exit'', filmed March 19\u201320, 1997, just days prior to the suicides.\n\nThey believed that, \"to be eligible for membership in the Next Level, humans would have to shed every attachment to the planet\".

One of these concepts was the belief of extraterrestrial [[walk-in]]s; when the group began, \"Applewhite and Nettles taught their followers that they were extraterrestrial beings. However, after the notion of walk-ins became popular within the New Age subculture, the Two changed their tune and began describing themselves as extraterrestrial walk-ins.\"<ref name=\"Lewis2001_16\" /> The idea of walk-ins is very similar to the concept of being possessed by spirits. A walk-in can be defined as \"an entity who occupies a body that has been vacated by its original soul\". Heaven's Gate came to believe an extraterrestrial walk-in is \"a walk-in that is supposedly from another planet\".<ref name=\"Lewis2001_368\">{{harvnb|Lewis|2001|p=368}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of walk-ins aided Applewhite and Nettles in personally starting from what they considered to be clean slates. In this so-called clean slate, they were no longer considered by members of this Heaven's Gate group to be the people they had been prior to the start of the group, but had taken on a new life; this concept gave them a way to \"erase their human personal histories as the histories of souls who formerly occupied the bodies of Applewhite and Nettles\".<ref name=\"Lewis2001_368\" /> Over time Applewhite also refined his identity in the group to encourage the belief that the \"walk in\" that was inhabiting his body was the same that had done so to Jesus 2,000 years ago. Similar to Nestorianism this belief stated that the personage of Jesus and the spirit of Jesus were separable. This meant that Jesus was simply the name of the body of an ordinary man that held no sacred properties that was taken over by an incorporeal sacred entity to deliver \"next level\" information.\n\nAnother New Age belief Applewhite and Nettles adopted was the [[ancient astronaut]] hypothesis. The term \"ancient astronauts\" is used to refer to various forms of the concept that extraterrestrials visited Earth in the distant past.<ref name=\"Lewis2001_16\" /> Applewhite and Nettles took part of this concept and taught it as the belief that \"aliens planted the seeds of current humanity millions of years ago, and have to come to reap the harvest of their work in the form of spiritually evolved individuals who will join the ranks of flying saucer crews. Only a select few members of humanity will be chosen to advance to this [[transhuman]] state. The rest will be left to wallow in the spiritually poisoned atmosphere of a corrupt world.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|2001|p=17}}</ref> Only the individuals who chose to join Heaven's Gate, follow Applewhite and Nettle's belief system, and make the sacrifices required by membership would be allowed to escape human suffering.\n\n=== Techniques to enter the next level ===\n\nAccording to Heaven's Gate, once the individual has perfected himself through the \"process\", there were four methods to enter or \"graduate\" to the next level:{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=193}}\n\n# Physical pickup onto a TELAH spacecraft and transfer to a next level body aboard that craft. In this version, what Professor Zeller calls a \"UFO\" version of the \"[[Rapture]]\", an alien spacecraft would descend to Earth, collect Applewhite, Nettles, and their followers, and their human bodies would be transformed through biological and chemical processes to perfected beings.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=31}} This and other UFO-related beliefs held by the group have led some observers to characterize the group as a type of [[UFO religion]].\n# Natural death, accidental death, or death from random violence. Here, the \"graduating soul\" leaves the human container for a perfected next-level body.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|pp=123\u201324}}\n# Outside persecution that leads to death. After the deaths of the [[Branch Davidians]] in Waco, Texas, and the events involving [[Randy Weaver]] at [[Ruby Ridge]], Applewhite was afraid the American government would murder the members of Heaven's Gate.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=184}}\n# Willful exit from the body in a dignified manner. Near the end, Applewhite had a revelation that they might have to abandon their human bodies and achieve the next level as Jesus had done.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|pp=123\u201324}} This occurred on March 22 and 23 when 39 members died by suicide and \"graduated\".{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|pp=171\u201372}}\n\n== Structure ==\n\nOpen only to adults over the age of 18,{{sfn|Zeller|2014b|p=38}} group members gave up their possessions and lived a highly [[Ascetism|ascetic]] life devoid of many indulgences.

After being fired from the [[University of St. Thomas (Texas)|University of St. Thomas]] in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] over an alleged relationship with one of his male students, he met [[Bonnie Nettles]], a 44-year-old married nurse with an interest in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and biblical prophecy, in March 1972.{{sfn|Goldwag|2009|p=77}} According to Applewhite's writings, the two met in a hospital where she worked while he was visiting a sick friend there. It has been rumored that it was a psychiatric hospital, but Nettles was substituting for another nurse working with premature babies in the nursery. {{sfn|Lewis|2003|p=111}} Applewhite later recalled that he felt like he had known Nettles for a long time and concluded that they had met in a past life.{{sfn|Lalich|2004|pp=44, 48}} She told him their meeting had been foretold to her by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]], persuading him that he had a divine assignment.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=210}}{{sfn|Lalich|2004|p=43}}\n\nApplewhite and Nettles pondered the life of [[St.&nbsp;Francis of Assisi]] and read works by authors including [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[R.&nbsp;D. Laing]], and [[Richard Bach]].{{sfnm|1a1=Zeller|1y=2006|1p=78|2a1=Bearak|2y=1997}}{{Incomplete short citation|date=January 2017}}{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=123}} They kept a [[King James Bible]] with them and studied several passages from the [[New Testament]], focusing on teachings about [[Christology]], [[asceticism]], and [[Christian eschatology|eschatology]].{{sfn|Zeller, \"Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics\"|2010|pp=42\u201343}} Applewhite also read [[science fiction]], including works by [[Robert A.&nbsp;Heinlein]] and [[Arthur C.&nbsp;Clarke]].{{sfn|Lifton|2000|p=306}} By June 19, Applewhite and Nettles's beliefs had solidified into a basic outline.{{sfn|Zeller, \"Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics\"|2010|p=40}} They concluded that they had been chosen to fulfill biblical prophecies, and that they had been given higher-level minds than other people.{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=355}} They wrote a pamphlet that described [[Jesus]]' [[reincarnation]] as a Texan, a thinly veiled reference to Applewhite.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=211}} Furthermore, they concluded that they were the [[two witnesses]] described in the [[Book of Revelation]]{{sfn|Zeller|2014b|p=108}} and occasionally visited churches or other spiritual groups to speak of their identities,{{sfnm|Chryssides|2005|1p=356|Zeller, \"Extraterrestrial Biblical Hermeneutics\"|2010|2p=40}} often referring to themselves as \"The Two\", or \"The UFO Two\".{{sfn|Zeller, ''Prophets and Protons''|2010|p=123}}{{sfn|Urban|2000|p=276}} They believed they would be killed and then restored to life and, in view of others, transported onto a spaceship. This event, which they referred to as \"the Demonstration\", was to prove their claims.{{sfn|Balch|Taylor|2002|p=211}} To their dismay, these ideas were poorly received by existing religious communities.{{sfn|Bearak|1997}}\n\nEventually, Applewhite and Nettles resolved to contact extraterrestrials, and they sought like-minded followers. They published advertisements for meetings, where they recruited disciples, whom they called \"the crew\".{{sfn|Chryssides|2005|p=356}} At the events, they purported to represent beings from another planet, the Next Level, who sought participants for an experiment. They stated that those who agreed to take part in the experiment would be brought to a higher evolutionary level.{{sfnm|Goerman|2011|1p=60|Chryssides|2005|2p=357}} In 1975, during a group meeting with eighty people in Joan Culpepper's [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]] home, they shared their \"simultaneous\" revelation that they had been told they were the two witnesses written into the Bible's story of the [[end time]].<ref name=\"laweekly2007\">{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/heavens-gate-the-sequel-2147951 |title=Heaven's Gate: The Sequel |date= 21 March 2007 |accessdate=2016-12-01 |work=LA Weekly }}</ref>\n\nLater in 1975, the crew assembled at a hotel in [[Waldport, Oregon|Waldport]], [[Oregon]]. After selling all \"worldly\" possessions and saying farewell to loved ones, the group vanished from the hotel and from the public eye.{{sfn|Goldwag|2009|p=77}} That night on the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'', [[Walter Cronkite]] reported that the group had disappeared, in one of the very first national reports on the developing religious group: \"A score of persons{{nbsp}}... have disappeared. It's a mystery whether they've been taken on a so-called trip to eternity\u2014or simply been taken.\"<ref name=\"laweekly2007\" /> In reality, Applewhite and Nettles had arranged for the group to go underground. From that point, \"Do and Ti\" (pronounced \"doe and tee\"), as the two now called themselves, led the nearly one-hundred-member crew across the country, sleeping in tents and sleeping bags and begging in the streets. Evading detection by the authorities and media enabled the group to focus on Do and Ti's doctrine of helping members of the crew achieve a \"higher evolutionary level\" above human, to which they claimed to have already reached.<ref name=\"laweekly2007\" />\n\nApplewhite and Nettles used a variety of [[Pseudonym|aliases]] over the years, notably \"[[Little Bo-Peep|Bo and Peep]]\" and \"[[Solf\u00e8ge|Do and Ti]]\". The group also had a variety of names\u2014prior to the adoption of the name Heaven's Gate (and at the time Vall\u00e9e studied the group), it was known as Human Individual Metamorphosis (HIM). The group re-invented and renamed itself several times and had a variety of recruitment methods.<ref>Ryan J.

Some sociologists agree that the popular movement of alternative religious experience and individualism found in collective spiritual experiences during that period helped contribute to the growth of the new religious movement. \"Sheilaism\", as it became known, was a way for people to merge their diverse religious backgrounds and coalesce around a shared, generalized faith, which followers of new religious sects like Applewhite's crew found a very appetizing alternative to traditional dogmas in [[Judaism]], [[Catholicism]] and [[evangelical Christianity]].

Initially the group had been told that they would be transported with their bodies on board a spacecraft that would come to Earth and take the crew to heaven, referred to as the \"next level\". When Bonnie Lou Nettles (Ti) died of cancer in 1985, it confounded Applewhite's doctrine because Nettles was allegedly chosen by the next level to be a messenger on Earth, yet her body died instead of leaving physically to outer space. The belief system was then refined to include the leaving of consciousness from the body as equivalent to leaving the Earth in a spacecraft.\n\nWhile the group was against [[suicide]], they defined \"suicide\" in their own context to mean \"to turn against the Next Level when it is being offered\" and believed their \"human\" bodies were only vessels meant to help them on their journey. Suicide, therefore, would be ''not'' allowing their consciousness to leave their human bodies to join the next level; remaining alive instead of participating in the group suicide was considered suicide of their consciousness.

One of these concepts was the belief of extraterrestrial [[walk-in]]s; when the group began, \"Applewhite and Nettles taught their followers that they were extraterrestrial beings. However, after the notion of walk-ins became popular within the New Age subculture, the Two changed their tune and began describing themselves as extraterrestrial walk-ins.\"<ref name=\"Lewis2001_16\" /> The idea of walk-ins is very similar to the concept of being possessed by spirits. A walk-in can be defined as \"an entity who occupies a body that has been vacated by its original soul\". Heaven's Gate came to believe an extraterrestrial walk-in is \"a walk-in that is supposedly from another planet\".<ref name=\"Lewis2001_368\">{{harvnb|Lewis|2001|p=368}}</ref>\n\nThe concept of walk-ins aided Applewhite and Nettles in personally starting from what they considered to be clean slates. In this so-called clean slate, they were no longer considered by members of this Heaven's Gate group to be the people they had been prior to the start of the group, but had taken on a new life; this concept gave them a way to \"erase their human personal histories as the histories of souls who formerly occupied the bodies of Applewhite and Nettles\".<ref name=\"Lewis2001_368\" /> Over time Applewhite also refined his identity in the group to encourage the belief that the \"walk in\" that was inhabiting his body was the same that had done so to Jesus 2,000 years ago. Similar to Nestorianism this belief stated that the personage of Jesus and the spirit of Jesus were separable. This meant that Jesus was simply the name of the body of an ordinary man that held no sacred properties that was taken over by an incorporeal sacred entity to deliver \"next level\" information.\n\nAnother New Age belief Applewhite and Nettles adopted was the [[ancient astronaut]] hypothesis. The term \"ancient astronauts\" is used to refer to various forms of the concept that extraterrestrials visited Earth in the distant past.<ref name=\"Lewis2001_16\" /> Applewhite and Nettles took part of this concept and taught it as the belief that \"aliens planted the seeds of current humanity millions of years ago, and have to come to reap the harvest of their work in the form of spiritually evolved individuals who will join the ranks of flying saucer crews. Only a select few members of humanity will be chosen to advance to this [[transhuman]] state. The rest will be left to wallow in the spiritually poisoned atmosphere of a corrupt world.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|2001|p=17}}</ref> Only the individuals who chose to join Heaven's Gate, follow Applewhite and Nettle's belief system, and make the sacrifices required by membership would be allowed to escape human suffering.\n\n=== Techniques to enter the next level ===\n\nAccording to Heaven's Gate, once the individual has perfected himself through the \"process\", there were four methods to enter or \"graduate\" to the next level:{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=193}}\n\n# Physical pickup onto a TELAH spacecraft and transfer to a next level body aboard that craft. In this version, what Professor Zeller calls a \"UFO\" version of the \"[[Rapture]]\", an alien spacecraft would descend to Earth, collect Applewhite, Nettles, and their followers, and their human bodies would be transformed through biological and chemical processes to perfected beings.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=31}} This and other UFO-related beliefs held by the group have led some observers to characterize the group as a type of [[UFO religion]].\n# Natural death, accidental death, or death from random violence. Here, the \"graduating soul\" leaves the human container for a perfected next-level body.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|pp=123\u201324}}\n# Outside persecution that leads to death. After the deaths of the [[Branch Davidians]] in Waco, Texas, and the events involving [[Randy Weaver]] at [[Ruby Ridge]], Applewhite was afraid the American government would murder the members of Heaven's Gate.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|p=184}}\n# Willful exit from the body in a dignified manner. Near the end, Applewhite had a revelation that they might have to abandon their human bodies and achieve the next level as Jesus had done.{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|pp=123\u201324}} This occurred on March 22 and 23 when 39 members died by suicide and \"graduated\".{{sfn|Zeller|2014a|pp=171\u201372}}\n\n== Structure ==\n\nOpen only to adults over the age of 18,{{sfn|Zeller|2014b|p=38}} group members gave up their possessions and lived a highly [[Ascetism|ascetic]] life devoid of many indulgences. The group was tightly knit and everything was [[Commune (intentional community)|communally]] shared. In public, each member of the group always carried only a five-dollar bill and one roll of quarters.{{sfn|Zeller|2014b|p=143}} Eight of the male members of the group, including Applewhite, voluntarily underwent [[castration]] in Mexico as an extreme means of maintaining its ascetic lifestyle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.culteducation.com/hgate.html|first=Rick|last=Ross|title='Heaven's Gate' Suicides|date=October 1999|publisher=The Rick A.

who specialises in the [[100 metres]]. He carried the flag for his native country at the opening ceremony of the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], [[2012 Summer Olympics]], and the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] and was a 100&nbsp;m semi-finalist at the [[2008 Beijing Olympics]].\n\nHe came to prominence in 2009 with a 100&nbsp;m win in the [[IAAF Golden League]] and a fourth-place finish at the [[2009 World Championships in Athletics]]. He was the bronze medallist over [[60 metres]] at the [[2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships]] and has also won sprint medals at Caribbean regional level. His personal best of 9.91&nbsp;seconds is the [[Antiguan and Barbudan records in athletics|Antiguan national record]] over 100&nbsp;m. \n\n==Career==\nBailey represented Antigua and Barbuda at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]], the [[2008 Summer Olympics]], the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]].\n\nBailey took up running at the age of 11, but preferring cricket and football, he only became a serious athlete at the age of 16.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://g2014results.thecgf.com/athlete/cycling_road/1031881/daniel_bailey.html|title=Glasgow 2014 - Daniel Bailey Profile|website=g2014results.thecgf.com|accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn Beijing at the 2008 Olympics, he competed at the 100 metres sprint and placed second in his heat, just four hundredths of a second after [[Usain Bolt]] in a time of 10.24 seconds.

The stele is dated to circa 840 BCE, however, the name of the Davidic king is not preserved, as much of the stele has not survived since the 9th century BCE. Because the stele coincides the death of the Davidic king with the death of [[Jehoram of Israel|Jehoram]], the king of the [[Kingdom of Samaria]], scholars have reconstructed the second slain king as [[Ahaziah of Judah]], but others disagree and say [[Amaziah of Judah|''Amaziah'' of Judah]] is the correct reconstruction.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Becking |editor1-first=Bob E.J.H. |editor2-last=Grabbe |editor2-first=Lester |title=Between Evidence and Ideology: Essays on the History of Ancient Israel Read at the Joint Meeting of the Society for Old Testament Study and the Oud Testamentisch Werkgezelschap Lincoln|publisher=Brill |date=2010 |page=18 |isbn=9789004187375|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DF7RzZJXM-UC&pg=PA18}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest unambiguously attested king from the Davidic line is [[Jotham of Judah]], who is named on the seals of his son and successor, [[Ahaz]],<ref>Deutsch, Robert. \"[http://www.archaeological-center.com/en/monographs/m1/ First Impression: What We Learn from King Ahaz's Seal]\".

A controversial artifact called the [[Jehoash Tablet]] recalls deeds performed by [[Jehoram of Judah]], who reigned about 100 years after Ahaz, however, scholars are tensely divided on whether or not the inscription is genuine.

The Tel Dan Stele, as aforementioned, remains the only mention of David himself outside the Bible, and the historical reliability of the United Monarchy of Israel is shoddy, at best. The [[Stepped Stone Structure]] and [[Large Stone Structure]] in [[Jerusalem]] show that Jerusalem was at least somewhat populated in King David's time, and lends at least ''some'' credence to the biblical claim that Jerusalem was originally a Canaanite fortress, however, Jerusalem seems to have been barely developed until long after David's death, making it hard to believe it could have been the empiric capital described in the Bible.

Even so, as for David and his immediate descendants themselves, the majority position, as described by [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman|Neil Silberman]], authors of ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]'', espouses that David and Solomon may well be based on \"certain historical kernels\", and probably did exist in their own right, but their historical counterparts simply could not have ruled over a wealthy lavish empire as described in the Bible, and were more likely chieftains of a comparatively modest Israelite society in Judah.\n\n==Kings of Israel and Judah==\n{{Main|Kings of Israel and Judah}}\n[[File:Genealogy of the kings of Israel and Judah.svg|thumb|500px|right|The genealogy of the [[Kings of Israel and Judah|kings of Judah, along with the kings of Israel]].]]\nAccording to the [[Tanakh]], upon being chosen and becoming king, one was customarily anointed with [[Holy anointing oil|holy oil]] poured on one's head. In David's case, this was done by the [[prophet]] [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]].\n\nInitially, David was king over the [[Tribe of Judah]] only and ruled from [[Hebron]], but after seven and a half years, the other [[Israelite]] tribes, who found themselves leaderless after the death of [[Ish-bosheth]], chose him to be their king as well.<ref>Mandel, David. ''Who's Who in the Jewish Bible''. Jewish Publication Society, 1 Jan 2010, pg 85</ref>\n\nAll subsequent kings in both the ancient first united [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the later [[Kingdom of Judah]] claimed direct descent from King David to validate their claim to the throne in order to rule over the Israelite tribes.\n\nAfter the death of David's son, [[King Solomon]], the ten northern tribes of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] rejected the Davidic line, refusing to accept Solomon's son, [[Rehoboam]], and instead chose as king [[Jeroboam]] and formed the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]]. This kingdom was conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in the 8th century BCE which exiled much of the Northern Kingdom population and ended its sovereign status. The bulk population of the Northern Kingdom of Israel was forced to relocate to Mesopotamia and mostly disappeared from history as [[Lost Ten Tribes|The Ten Lost Tribes]] or intermixed with exiled Judean populations two centuries later, while the remaining Israelite peoples in Samaria highlands have become known as [[Samaritans]] during the classic era and to modern times.\n\n==The Exilarchate==\n{{main|Exilarch}}\nFollowing the conquest of Judah by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and the [[Babylonian captivity|exile of its population]], the Babylonian [[Exilarch]]ate was established. The highest official of Babylonian Jewry was the exilarch ([[Reish Galuta]], \"Head of the Diaspora\"). Those who held the position traced their ancestry to the House of David in the male line.<ref>Max A Margolis and Alexander Marx, ''A History of the Jewish People'' (1927), p. 235.</ref> The position holder was regarded as a king-in-waiting, residing in Babylon and later in the [[Achaemenid Empire]] during the classic era. [[Zerubbabel]] of the Davidic line is mentioned as one of the leaders of the Jewish community in the 5th century BCE, holding the title of Achaeminid Governor of [[Yehud Medinata]].\n\n==The Hasmonean and Herodian periods==\n{{See|Hasmonean dynasty|Herodian dynasty}}\nThe Hasmoneans, also known as the [[Maccabees]] established their own monarchy in [[Judea]] following their [[Maccabean Revolt|revolt]] against the [[Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid dynasty]]. The Hasmoneans were not considered connected to the Davidic line nor to the [[Tribe of Judah]]. The [[Levites]] had always been excluded from the Israelite monarchy, so when the Maccabees assumed the throne in order to rededicate the defiled [[Second Temple]], a cardinal rule was broken. According to scholars within [[Orthodox Judaism]], this is considered to have contributed to their downfall and the eventual downfall of Judea; internal strife allowing for Roman occupation and the violent installation of [[Herod the Great]] as [[Client state|client king]] over the [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judea]]; and the subsequent [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction]] of the [[Second Temple]] by the future [[Emperor Titus]].\n\nDuring the Hasmonean period the Davidic line was largely excluded from the royal house in Judea, but some members had risen to prominence as religious and communal leaders. One of the most notable of those was [[Hillel the Elder]], who moved to Judea from his birthplace in Babylon. His great grandson [[Simeon ben Gamliel]] became one of the Jewish leaders during the [[First Jewish-Roman War]].<ref>Wilhelm Bacher, Jacob Zallel Lauterbach (1906).  \"[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13680-simeon-ii-ben-gamaliel-i Simeon II. (Ben Gamaliel I.)]\", Jewish Encyclopedia. N.b.: the Jewish Encyclopedia speaks of \"his grandfather Hillel\", but he sequence was Hillel the Elder-[[Simeon ben Hillel]]-[[Gamaliel the Elder]]-Simeon ben Gamliel, thus great-grandson is correct.</ref>\n\n==Middle Ages==\n{{main|Exilarchate}}\nThe Exilarchate in the [[Sasanian Empire]] was briefly abolished as a result of revolt by the [[Mar-Zutra II]] in the late 5th century CE, with his son [[Mar-Zutra III]] being denied the office and relocating to [[Tiberias]], then within the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Mar Ahunai (exilarch)|Mar Ahunai]] lived in the period succeeding Mar Zutra II, but for almost fifty years after the failed revolt he did not dare to appear in public, and it is not known whether even then (c. 550) he really acted as Exilarch. The names of [[Kafnai (exilarch)|Kafnai]] and his son [[Haninai (exilarch)|Haninai]], who were Exilarchs in the second half of the 6th century, have been preserved.\n\nThe Exilarchate in Mesopotamia was officially restored after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab conquest]] in the 7th century and continued to function during the early [[Caliphate]]s. Exilarchs continued to be appointed until the 11th century, with some members of the Davidic line dispersing across the Islamic world. There are conflicting accounts of the fate of the Exilarch family in the 11th century - according to one version [[Hezekiah ben David]], who was the last Exilarch and also the last [[Gaon (Hebrew)| Gaon]], was imprisoned and tortured to death. Two of his sons fled to Al-Andalus, where they found refuge with Joseph, the son and successor of [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]]. However, ''[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]]'' mentions that Hezekiah was liberated from prison, and became head of the academy, and is mentioned as such by a contemporary in 1046.<ref>Jewish Quarterly Review, hereafter \"J. Q. R.\", xv. 80.</ref> An unsuccessful attempt of David ben Daniel of the Davidic line to establish an Exilarchate in the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] failed and ended with his downfall in 1094.\n\nDescendants of the house of exilarchs were living in various places long after the office became extinct. The grandson of Hezekiah ben David through his eldest son David ben Chyzkia, [[Hiyya al-Daudi]], died in 1154 in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] according to [[Abraham ibn Daud]] and is the ancestor of the [[Yaish Ibn Yahya|ibn Yahya]] family. Several families, as late as the 14th century, traced their descent back to Josiah, the brother of [[David ben Zakkai]] who had been banished to Chorasan (see the genealogies in [Lazarus 1890] pp.&nbsp;180 et seq.). The descendants of the Karaite Exilarchs have been referred to above.\n\nA number of Jewish families in the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]] and within [[Mesopotamia]] continued to preserve the tradition of descent from Exilarchs in the [[Late Middle Ages]], including the families of [[Abravanel]], [[Yaish Ibn Yahya|ibn Yahya]] and Ben-David. One tradition also traces the ancestry of [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] to Babylonian Exilarchs (during the era of the [[geonim]]) and therefore also from the Davidic dynasty,<ref>See [http://chfreedman.blogspot.com/2007/06/maharal-of-pragues-descent-from-king.html The Maharal of Prague's Descent from King David], by Chaim Freedman, published in ''Avotaynu'' Vol 22 No 1, Spring 2006</ref> which is however disputed.\n\nIn the 11th-15th century, these families referred to as heads of the [[Jewish diaspora]] or Exiliarchs from Babylon lived in the South of France ([[Narbonne]] and [[Provence]]) and in northern Spain ([[Barcelona]], [[Aragon]] and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile]]). These families received the title \"[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]]\" in the communities and were called \"free men\". They had a special economic and social status in the Jewish community.

One Christian interpretation of the Davidic line counts the line continuing to [[Jesus]]  son of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], according to the genealogies at [[Matthew 1]]:1-16 and also in [[Luke 3]]:23-38.\n\nAs it has been historically accepted among Jews that the Messiah will be a male-line descendant of David, the lineage of Jesus is sometimes cited as a factor as to why Jews do not believe him to have been the Messiah. As the proposed son of God, he could not have been a male-line descendant of David and, if going through his earthly parents, Mary and Joseph, he would not have had the proper lineage either, as he would not have been a male-line descendant through Mary, and Joseph descended from [[Jeconiah]], whose descendants are explicitly barred by God from ever ruling Israel.<ref>This is what the LORD says: 'Record this man as if childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah.\u2014\u2009Jeremiah 22:30, NIV</ref>\n\nAnother Christian interpretation emphasizes the minor, non-royal, line of David through [[Solomon]]'s brother [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]] as recorded in [[Gospel of Luke]] [[Luke 3|chapter 3]] (entirely undocumented in the Hebrew Bible), which is often understood to be the family tree of Mary's father. A widely spread traditional Christian interpretation relates the non-continuation of the main Davidic line from Solomon as related the godlessness of [[Jehoiachin]] in the early 500s BC, where [[Jeremiah]] cursed the main branch of the Solomonic line, saying that no descendant of \"[Je]Coniah\" would ever again reign on the throne of Israel ([[Jeremiah 22:30]]).<ref>H.

Even so, as for David and his immediate descendants themselves, the majority position, as described by [[Israel Finkelstein]] and [[Neil Asher Silberman|Neil Silberman]], authors of ''[[The Bible Unearthed]]'', espouses that David and Solomon may well be based on \"certain historical kernels\", and probably did exist in their own right, but their historical counterparts simply could not have ruled over a wealthy lavish empire as described in the Bible, and were more likely chieftains of a comparatively modest Israelite society in Judah.\n\n==Kings of Israel and Judah==\n{{Main|Kings of Israel and Judah}}\n[[File:Genealogy of the kings of Israel and Judah.svg|thumb|500px|right|The genealogy of the [[Kings of Israel and Judah|kings of Judah, along with the kings of Israel]].]]\nAccording to the [[Tanakh]], upon being chosen and becoming king, one was customarily anointed with [[Holy anointing oil|holy oil]] poured on one's head. In David's case, this was done by the [[prophet]] [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]].\n\nInitially, David was king over the [[Tribe of Judah]] only and ruled from [[Hebron]], but after seven and a half years, the other [[Israelite]] tribes, who found themselves leaderless after the death of [[Ish-bosheth]], chose him to be their king as well.<ref>Mandel, David. ''Who's Who in the Jewish Bible''. Jewish Publication Society, 1 Jan 2010, pg 85</ref>\n\nAll subsequent kings in both the ancient first united [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] and the later [[Kingdom of Judah]] claimed direct descent from King David to validate their claim to the throne in order to rule over the Israelite tribes.\n\nAfter the death of David's son, [[King Solomon]], the ten northern tribes of the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] rejected the Davidic line, refusing to accept Solomon's son, [[Rehoboam]], and instead chose as king [[Jeroboam]] and formed the northern [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]]. This kingdom was conquered by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in the 8th century BCE which exiled much of the Northern Kingdom population and ended its sovereign status. The bulk population of the Northern Kingdom of Israel was forced to relocate to Mesopotamia and mostly disappeared from history as [[Lost Ten Tribes|The Ten Lost Tribes]] or intermixed with exiled Judean populations two centuries later, while the remaining Israelite peoples in Samaria highlands have become known as [[Samaritans]] during the classic era and to modern times.\n\n==The Exilarchate==\n{{main|Exilarch}}\nFollowing the conquest of Judah by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] and the [[Babylonian captivity|exile of its population]], the Babylonian [[Exilarch]]ate was established. The highest official of Babylonian Jewry was the exilarch ([[Reish Galuta]], \"Head of the Diaspora\"). Those who held the position traced their ancestry to the House of David in the male line.<ref>Max A Margolis and Alexander Marx, ''A History of the Jewish People'' (1927), p. 235.</ref> The position holder was regarded as a king-in-waiting, residing in Babylon and later in the [[Achaemenid Empire]] during the classic era. [[Zerubbabel]] of the Davidic line is mentioned as one of the leaders of the Jewish community in the 5th century BCE, holding the title of Achaeminid Governor of [[Yehud Medinata]].\n\n==The Hasmonean and Herodian periods==\n{{See|Hasmonean dynasty|Herodian dynasty}}\nThe Hasmoneans, also known as the [[Maccabees]] established their own monarchy in [[Judea]] following their [[Maccabean Revolt|revolt]] against the [[Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid dynasty]]. The Hasmoneans were not considered connected to the Davidic line nor to the [[Tribe of Judah]]. The [[Levites]] had always been excluded from the Israelite monarchy, so when the Maccabees assumed the throne in order to rededicate the defiled [[Second Temple]], a cardinal rule was broken. According to scholars within [[Orthodox Judaism]], this is considered to have contributed to their downfall and the eventual downfall of Judea; internal strife allowing for Roman occupation and the violent installation of [[Herod the Great]] as [[Client state|client king]] over the [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman province of Judea]]; and the subsequent [[Siege of Jerusalem (70 CE)|destruction]] of the [[Second Temple]] by the future [[Emperor Titus]].\n\nDuring the Hasmonean period the Davidic line was largely excluded from the royal house in Judea, but some members had risen to prominence as religious and communal leaders. One of the most notable of those was [[Hillel the Elder]], who moved to Judea from his birthplace in Babylon. His great grandson [[Simeon ben Gamliel]] became one of the Jewish leaders during the [[First Jewish-Roman War]].<ref>Wilhelm Bacher, Jacob Zallel Lauterbach (1906).  \"[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13680-simeon-ii-ben-gamaliel-i Simeon II. (Ben Gamaliel I.)]\", Jewish Encyclopedia. N.b.: the Jewish Encyclopedia speaks of \"his grandfather Hillel\", but he sequence was Hillel the Elder-[[Simeon ben Hillel]]-[[Gamaliel the Elder]]-Simeon ben Gamliel, thus great-grandson is correct.</ref>\n\n==Middle Ages==\n{{main|Exilarchate}}\nThe Exilarchate in the [[Sasanian Empire]] was briefly abolished as a result of revolt by the [[Mar-Zutra II]] in the late 5th century CE, with his son [[Mar-Zutra III]] being denied the office and relocating to [[Tiberias]], then within the [[Byzantine Empire]]. [[Mar Ahunai (exilarch)|Mar Ahunai]] lived in the period succeeding Mar Zutra II, but for almost fifty years after the failed revolt he did not dare to appear in public, and it is not known whether even then (c. 550) he really acted as Exilarch. The names of [[Kafnai (exilarch)|Kafnai]] and his son [[Haninai (exilarch)|Haninai]], who were Exilarchs in the second half of the 6th century, have been preserved.\n\nThe Exilarchate in Mesopotamia was officially restored after the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Arab conquest]] in the 7th century and continued to function during the early [[Caliphate]]s. Exilarchs continued to be appointed until the 11th century, with some members of the Davidic line dispersing across the Islamic world. There are conflicting accounts of the fate of the Exilarch family in the 11th century - according to one version [[Hezekiah ben David]], who was the last Exilarch and also the last [[Gaon (Hebrew)| Gaon]], was imprisoned and tortured to death. Two of his sons fled to Al-Andalus, where they found refuge with Joseph, the son and successor of [[Samuel ibn Naghrillah]]. However, ''[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]]'' mentions that Hezekiah was liberated from prison, and became head of the academy, and is mentioned as such by a contemporary in 1046.<ref>Jewish Quarterly Review, hereafter \"J. Q. R.\", xv. 80.</ref> An unsuccessful attempt of David ben Daniel of the Davidic line to establish an Exilarchate in the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] failed and ended with his downfall in 1094.\n\nDescendants of the house of exilarchs were living in various places long after the office became extinct. The grandson of Hezekiah ben David through his eldest son David ben Chyzkia, [[Hiyya al-Daudi]], died in 1154 in [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] according to [[Abraham ibn Daud]] and is the ancestor of the [[Yaish Ibn Yahya|ibn Yahya]] family. Several families, as late as the 14th century, traced their descent back to Josiah, the brother of [[David ben Zakkai]] who had been banished to Chorasan (see the genealogies in [Lazarus 1890] pp.&nbsp;180 et seq.). The descendants of the Karaite Exilarchs have been referred to above.\n\nA number of Jewish families in the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]] and within [[Mesopotamia]] continued to preserve the tradition of descent from Exilarchs in the [[Late Middle Ages]], including the families of [[Abravanel]], [[Yaish Ibn Yahya|ibn Yahya]] and Ben-David. One tradition also traces the ancestry of [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel]] to Babylonian Exilarchs (during the era of the [[geonim]]) and therefore also from the Davidic dynasty,<ref>See [http://chfreedman.blogspot.com/2007/06/maharal-of-pragues-descent-from-king.html The Maharal of Prague's Descent from King David], by Chaim Freedman, published in ''Avotaynu'' Vol 22 No 1, Spring 2006</ref> which is however disputed.\n\nIn the 11th-15th century, these families referred to as heads of the [[Jewish diaspora]] or Exiliarchs from Babylon lived in the South of France ([[Narbonne]] and [[Provence]]) and in northern Spain ([[Barcelona]], [[Aragon]] and [[Castile and Le\u00f3n|Castile]]). These families received the title \"[[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Nasi]]\" in the communities and were called \"free men\". They had a special economic and social status in the Jewish community.

One Christian interpretation of the Davidic line counts the line continuing to [[Jesus]]  son of [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]], according to the genealogies at [[Matthew 1]]:1-16 and also in [[Luke 3]]:23-38.\n\nAs it has been historically accepted among Jews that the Messiah will be a male-line descendant of David, the lineage of Jesus is sometimes cited as a factor as to why Jews do not believe him to have been the Messiah. As the proposed son of God, he could not have been a male-line descendant of David and, if going through his earthly parents, Mary and Joseph, he would not have had the proper lineage either, as he would not have been a male-line descendant through Mary, and Joseph descended from [[Jeconiah]], whose descendants are explicitly barred by God from ever ruling Israel.<ref>This is what the LORD says: 'Record this man as if childless, a man who will not prosper in his lifetime, for none of his offspring will prosper, none will sit on the throne of David or rule anymore in Judah.\u2014\u2009Jeremiah 22:30, NIV</ref>\n\nAnother Christian interpretation emphasizes the minor, non-royal, line of David through [[Solomon]]'s brother [[Nathan (son of David)|Nathan]] as recorded in [[Gospel of Luke]] [[Luke 3|chapter 3]] (entirely undocumented in the Hebrew Bible), which is often understood to be the family tree of Mary's father. A widely spread traditional Christian interpretation relates the non-continuation of the main Davidic line from Solomon as related the godlessness of [[Jehoiachin]] in the early 500s BC, where [[Jeremiah]] cursed the main branch of the Solomonic line, saying that no descendant of \"[Je]Coniah\" would ever again reign on the throne of Israel ([[Jeremiah 22:30]]).<ref>H. Wayne House ''Israel: Land and the People'' 1998 114 \"And yet, Judah has also been without a king of the Solomonic line since the Babylonian exile.

The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, soon after the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad's job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him.

The story began with the reader finding out the main character, Paul, is suspended from high school. He meets with his principal and teachers who complain about Paul's \"defiant manner\" in class and the \"physical aversion\" he exhibits toward his teachers. One of Paul's teachers also mentions that Paul's mother died back when he was a child in Colorado; which is later shown to be of importance. Paul works as an usher for Carnegie Hall in Pittsburgh. His job is one of the only parts of his life he enjoys. He stays for the concert and enjoys the social scene while losing himself in the music. After the concert, Paul follows the soloist and imagines life inside her hotel room. Unfortunately, soon after the audience learns that Paul and his father have a poor relationship. Upon returning home very late one night, Paul enters through the basement window to avoid a confrontation with his father. Paul's relationship with his father is one of tension. While in the basement, Paul gets nervous that his father will come downstairs with a shotgun and kill him. Paul stays awake for the remainder of the night, imagining what would happen if his father mistook him for a burglar and shot him, or if his dad would recognize him in time. Not only does Paul wonder if his father will recognize him in time, but he also entertains the idea of his father possibly regretting not shooting him when he had the chance to do so.   \n\nPaul despises the people on Cordelia Street as they serve to remind him of his own lackluster life. Although his father considers him a role model for Paul, Paul is unimpressed by a plodding young man who works for an iron company and is married with four children. While Paul longs to be wealthy, cultivated, and powerful, He lacks the stamina and ambition to attempt to change his condition. Instead, Paul escapes his monotonous life by visiting Charley Edwards; a young actor. Later on, Paul makes it clear to one of his teachers that his job ushering is more important than his schoolwork, causing his father to prevent him from continuing to work as an usher.\n\nPaul takes a train to New York City after stealing money from his dad's job. Paul buys an expensive wardrobe, rents a room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]], and walks around the city. He also meets a young boy from [[San Francisco]] who takes him on an all-night tour of the city's lively social scene. His few days of impersonating a rich, privileged young man, brought him more contentment than he had ever known because living a prosperous life is Paul's only hope and dream.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://english.fju.edu.tw/lctd/asp/works/51/study.htm#03|title=Paul's Case|website=english.fju.edu.tw|access-date=2016-11-17}}</ref> However, on the eighth day, after spending most of his money, Paul read from a Pittsburgh newspaper that his theft has been made public. His father has returned the money and is on his way to New York City to bring Paul back home to Pittsburgh. Paul then reveals that he had bought a gun on his first day in New York City, and briefly considers shooting himself to avoid returning to his old life in Pittsburgh. Eventually, he decides against it and instead commits suicide by jumping in front of a train. Paul made the ultimate decision of taking his own life because the thought of returning to his old lifestyle was too much for him to handle.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Gerald T.|date=July 2003|title=The Willa Cather Electronic Archive2003395The Willa Cather Electronic Archive.

Once Paul's father stopped him from working at the theater, Paul lost his sole outlet and place of comfort. Paul's connection to the theater developed because he acquired interest in the arts and it became a reliable place for him. The theater allowed him to develop creative skills that he did not gain at school. Being an usher at the theater helped Paul express himself and be around others who enjoyed the arts just like him.

It provides practical techniques for extracting quantitative information about a three-dimensional material from measurements made on two-dimensional planar sections of the material. Stereology is a method that utilizes random, systematic sampling to provide unbiased and quantitative data.  It is an important and efficient tool in many applications of [[microscopy]] (such as [[petrography]], [[materials science]], and biosciences including [[histology]], [[bone]] and [[neuroanatomy]]). Stereology is a developing science with many important innovations being developed mainly in Europe. New innovations such as the [[proportionator]] continue to make important improvements in the efficiency of stereological procedures.\n\nIn addition to two-dimensional plane sections, stereology also applies to three-dimensional slabs (e.g. 3D microscope images), one-dimensional probes (e.g. needle biopsy), projected images, and other kinds of 'sampling'. It is especially useful when the sample has a lower spatial dimension than the original material.\nHence, stereology is often defined as the science of estimating higher-[[dimension]]al information from lower-dimensional samples.\n\nStereology is based on fundamental principles of [[geometry]] (e.g. [[Cavalieri's principle]]) and [[statistics]] (mainly [[survey sampling]] inference). ''It is a completely different approach from [[computed tomography]]''.\n\n== Classical examples ==\n\nClassical applications of stereology include:\n* calculating the volume fraction of quartz in a rock by measuring the area fraction of quartz on a typical polished plane section of rock (\"Delesse principle\");\n* calculating the surface area of pores per unit volume in a ceramic, by measuring the length of profiles of pore boundary per unit area on a typical plane section of the ceramic (multiplied by <math>4/\\pi</math>);\n* calculating the total length of capillaries per unit volume of a biological tissue, by counting the number of profiles of capillaries per unit area on a typical histological section of the tissue (multiplied by 2).\n\nThe popular science fact that the human lungs have a surface area (of gas exchange surface) equivalent to a tennis court (75 square meters), was obtained by stereological methods. Similarly for statements about the total length of nerve fibres, capillaries etc. in the human body.\n\n== Errors in spatial interpretation ==\n\nThe word Stereology was coined in 1961 and defined as `the spatial interpretation of sections'. This reflects the founders' idea that stereology also offers insights and rules for the qualitative interpretation of sections.\n\nStereologists have helped to\ndetect many fundamental scientific errors arising from the misinterpretation of plane sections. Such errors are\nsurprisingly common. For example:\n* plane sections of quenched steel contain thin linear streaks of Martensite. For many years this was interpreted as demonstrating that the Martensite inclusions are \"needle-like\". But if every plane section shows linear profiles, then the Martensite inclusions must be plate-like, rather than needle-like. (Length on sections is related to area in 3D).\n* the internal structure of mammalian liver was misunderstood for 100 years (1848\u20131948) because of a similar error.\n* a biological tissue containing capillaries is sectioned. Researchers count the number of profiles of capillaries that are visible in a microscope field, and report the \"number of capillaries\" or \"number of capillaries per unit area\". This is an error because the number of capillary profiles on a plane section is related to the '''length''' of capillaries, not to their number (which may not even be well-defined). (Number in 2D is related to length in 3D).\n* researchers compare plane sections of normal and diseased tissue from an organ. They find that a certain type of cell is seen more frequently in the diseased tissue. They conclude that the disease involves proliferation of these cells. However, the number of cell profiles seen on a section depends both on the number of cells and on their sizes. So it is possible that the disease process simply involves an increase in the size of cells, without any proliferation. (Number in 2D is related to length or height in 3D).\n* the construction of historic Tabby buildings in the Carolinas was assumed to be done with sand obtained from sand pits. Stereological studies demonstrated that the sand was obtained from dunes facing the bays. This has caused the method of construction to be rethought as well as methods of restoration.\n\n== Stereology is not tomography ==\n\nStereology is a completely different enterprise from [[computed tomography]].\nA computed tomography algorithm effectively reconstructs the complete internal three-dimensional geometry of an object, given a complete set of all plane sections through it (or equivalent X-ray data).\nOn the contrary, stereological techniques require only a few 'representative' plane sections, from which they statistically extrapolate the three-dimensional material.\n\nStereology exploits the fact that some 3-D quantities can be determined without 3-D reconstruction: for example, the 3-D volume of any object can be determined from the 2-D areas of its plane sections, without reconstructing the object. (This means that stereology only works for certain quantities like volume, and not for other quantities).\n\n== Sampling principles ==\n\nIn addition to using geometrical facts, stereology applies [[statistics|statistical]] principles to extrapolate three-dimensional shapes from plane section(s) of a material.<ref>Howard, C.V., Reed, M. G. ''Unbiased Stereology (second edition)''. Garland Science/BIOS Scientific Publishers, 2005. pp. 143\u2013163</ref> The statistical principles are the same as those of [[survey sampling]] (used to draw inferences about a human population from an opinion poll, etc.).\nStatisticians regard stereology as a form of sampling theory for spatial populations.\n\nTo extrapolate from a few plane sections to the three-dimensional material, essentially the sections must be 'typical' or 'representative' of the entire material. There are basically two ways to ensure this:\n* It is assumed that any plane section is typical (e.g. assume that the material is completely homogeneous);\nor\n* Plane sections are selected at random, according to a specified random sampling protocol\n\nThe first approach is the one that was used in classical stereology.\nExtrapolation from the sample to the 3-D material depends on the assumption that the material is homogeneous. This effectively postulates a statistical model of the material.  This method of sampling is referred to as ''model-based'' sampling inference.\n\nThe second approach is the one typically used in modern stereology.\nInstead of relying on model assumptions about the three-dimensional material, we take our sample of plane sections by following a randomized sampling design, for example, choosing a random position at which to start cutting the material. Extrapolation from the sample to the 3-D material is valid because of the randomness of the sampling design, so this is called ''design-based'' sampling inference.\n\nDesign-based stereological methods can be applied to materials which are inhomogeneous or cannot be assumed to be homogeneous. These methods have gained increasing popularity in the biomedical sciences, especially in lung-, kidney-, bone-, cancer- and neuro-science. Many of these applications are directed toward determining the number of elements in a particular structure, e.g. the total number of neurons in the brain.\n\n== Geometrical models ==\n\nMany classical stereological techniques, in addition to assuming homogeneity, also involved mathematical modeling of the geometry of the structures under investigation.\nThese methods are still popular in materials science, metallurgy and petrology where shapes of e.g. crystals may be modelled as simple geometrical objects. Such geometrical models make it possible to extract additional information (including numbers of crystals). However, they are extremely sensitive to departures from the assumptions.\n\n== Total quantities ==\n\nIn the classical examples listed above, the target quantities were relative densities: volume fraction, surface area per unit volume, and length per unit volume. Often we are more interested in ''total'' quantities such as the total surface area of the lung's gas exchange surface, or the total length of capillaries in the brain. relative densities are also problematic because, unless the material is homogeneous, they depend on the unambiguous definition of the reference volume.\n\nSampling principles also make it possible to estimate total quantities such as the total surface area of lung. Using techniques such as [[systematic sampling]] and [[cluster sampling]] we can effectively sample a fixed fraction of the entire material (without the need to delineate a reference volume). This allows us to extrapolate from the sample to the entire material, to obtain estimates of total quantities such as the absolute surface area of lung and the absolute number of cells in the brain.\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n* 1733 [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|G. Buffon]] discovers connections between geometry and probability, that ultimately lay the foundations for stereology.\n\n* 1843 Mining geologist [[Achille Ernest Oscar Joseph Delesse|A. E.

It is especially useful when the sample has a lower spatial dimension than the original material.\nHence, stereology is often defined as the science of estimating higher-[[dimension]]al information from lower-dimensional samples.\n\nStereology is based on fundamental principles of [[geometry]] (e.g. [[Cavalieri's principle]]) and [[statistics]] (mainly [[survey sampling]] inference). ''It is a completely different approach from [[computed tomography]]''.\n\n== Classical examples ==\n\nClassical applications of stereology include:\n* calculating the volume fraction of quartz in a rock by measuring the area fraction of quartz on a typical polished plane section of rock (\"Delesse principle\");\n* calculating the surface area of pores per unit volume in a ceramic, by measuring the length of profiles of pore boundary per unit area on a typical plane section of the ceramic (multiplied by <math>4/\\pi</math>);\n* calculating the total length of capillaries per unit volume of a biological tissue, by counting the number of profiles of capillaries per unit area on a typical histological section of the tissue (multiplied by 2).\n\nThe popular science fact that the human lungs have a surface area (of gas exchange surface) equivalent to a tennis court (75 square meters), was obtained by stereological methods. Similarly for statements about the total length of nerve fibres, capillaries etc. in the human body.\n\n== Errors in spatial interpretation ==\n\nThe word Stereology was coined in 1961 and defined as `the spatial interpretation of sections'. This reflects the founders' idea that stereology also offers insights and rules for the qualitative interpretation of sections.\n\nStereologists have helped to\ndetect many fundamental scientific errors arising from the misinterpretation of plane sections. Such errors are\nsurprisingly common. For example:\n* plane sections of quenched steel contain thin linear streaks of Martensite. For many years this was interpreted as demonstrating that the Martensite inclusions are \"needle-like\". But if every plane section shows linear profiles, then the Martensite inclusions must be plate-like, rather than needle-like. (Length on sections is related to area in 3D).\n* the internal structure of mammalian liver was misunderstood for 100 years (1848\u20131948) because of a similar error.\n* a biological tissue containing capillaries is sectioned. Researchers count the number of profiles of capillaries that are visible in a microscope field, and report the \"number of capillaries\" or \"number of capillaries per unit area\". This is an error because the number of capillary profiles on a plane section is related to the '''length''' of capillaries, not to their number (which may not even be well-defined). (Number in 2D is related to length in 3D).\n* researchers compare plane sections of normal and diseased tissue from an organ. They find that a certain type of cell is seen more frequently in the diseased tissue. They conclude that the disease involves proliferation of these cells. However, the number of cell profiles seen on a section depends both on the number of cells and on their sizes. So it is possible that the disease process simply involves an increase in the size of cells, without any proliferation. (Number in 2D is related to length or height in 3D).\n* the construction of historic Tabby buildings in the Carolinas was assumed to be done with sand obtained from sand pits. Stereological studies demonstrated that the sand was obtained from dunes facing the bays. This has caused the method of construction to be rethought as well as methods of restoration.\n\n== Stereology is not tomography ==\n\nStereology is a completely different enterprise from [[computed tomography]].\nA computed tomography algorithm effectively reconstructs the complete internal three-dimensional geometry of an object, given a complete set of all plane sections through it (or equivalent X-ray data).\nOn the contrary, stereological techniques require only a few 'representative' plane sections, from which they statistically extrapolate the three-dimensional material.\n\nStereology exploits the fact that some 3-D quantities can be determined without 3-D reconstruction: for example, the 3-D volume of any object can be determined from the 2-D areas of its plane sections, without reconstructing the object. (This means that stereology only works for certain quantities like volume, and not for other quantities).\n\n== Sampling principles ==\n\nIn addition to using geometrical facts, stereology applies [[statistics|statistical]] principles to extrapolate three-dimensional shapes from plane section(s) of a material.<ref>Howard, C.V., Reed, M. G. ''Unbiased Stereology (second edition)''. Garland Science/BIOS Scientific Publishers, 2005. pp. 143\u2013163</ref> The statistical principles are the same as those of [[survey sampling]] (used to draw inferences about a human population from an opinion poll, etc.).\nStatisticians regard stereology as a form of sampling theory for spatial populations.\n\nTo extrapolate from a few plane sections to the three-dimensional material, essentially the sections must be 'typical' or 'representative' of the entire material. There are basically two ways to ensure this:\n* It is assumed that any plane section is typical (e.g. assume that the material is completely homogeneous);\nor\n* Plane sections are selected at random, according to a specified random sampling protocol\n\nThe first approach is the one that was used in classical stereology.\nExtrapolation from the sample to the 3-D material depends on the assumption that the material is homogeneous. This effectively postulates a statistical model of the material.  This method of sampling is referred to as ''model-based'' sampling inference.\n\nThe second approach is the one typically used in modern stereology.\nInstead of relying on model assumptions about the three-dimensional material, we take our sample of plane sections by following a randomized sampling design, for example, choosing a random position at which to start cutting the material. Extrapolation from the sample to the 3-D material is valid because of the randomness of the sampling design, so this is called ''design-based'' sampling inference.\n\nDesign-based stereological methods can be applied to materials which are inhomogeneous or cannot be assumed to be homogeneous. These methods have gained increasing popularity in the biomedical sciences, especially in lung-, kidney-, bone-, cancer- and neuro-science. Many of these applications are directed toward determining the number of elements in a particular structure, e.g. the total number of neurons in the brain.\n\n== Geometrical models ==\n\nMany classical stereological techniques, in addition to assuming homogeneity, also involved mathematical modeling of the geometry of the structures under investigation.\nThese methods are still popular in materials science, metallurgy and petrology where shapes of e.g. crystals may be modelled as simple geometrical objects. Such geometrical models make it possible to extract additional information (including numbers of crystals). However, they are extremely sensitive to departures from the assumptions.\n\n== Total quantities ==\n\nIn the classical examples listed above, the target quantities were relative densities: volume fraction, surface area per unit volume, and length per unit volume. Often we are more interested in ''total'' quantities such as the total surface area of the lung's gas exchange surface, or the total length of capillaries in the brain. relative densities are also problematic because, unless the material is homogeneous, they depend on the unambiguous definition of the reference volume.\n\nSampling principles also make it possible to estimate total quantities such as the total surface area of lung. Using techniques such as [[systematic sampling]] and [[cluster sampling]] we can effectively sample a fixed fraction of the entire material (without the need to delineate a reference volume). This allows us to extrapolate from the sample to the entire material, to obtain estimates of total quantities such as the absolute surface area of lung and the absolute number of cells in the brain.\n\n== Timeline ==\n\n* 1733 [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|G. Buffon]] discovers connections between geometry and probability, that ultimately lay the foundations for stereology.\n\n* 1843 Mining geologist [[Achille Ernest Oscar Joseph Delesse|A. E.

The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants.

The medals hanging from the lion's rampant (which represented Cheshire and [[Lancashire]], owing to Stockport's location astride the Mersey which forms the historic border between the two counties) were removed.

During the mid-1960s, the Football League introduced a minimum admission price for all clubs in all four divisions, attempting to help boost revenue for lower clubs. It had the desired effect only in small towns miles from big city teams. It had the opposite effect in larger places like Stockport, where lower-league clubs were in relatively close proximity to clubs in higher divisions. Stockport devised a solution, moving all their home games to Friday evening kick-offs, which generated larger crowds and extra business in surrounding pubs and restaurants.

{"title_page": "Freelensing", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Orphan|date=July 2013}}\n{{unreferenced|date=July 2013}}\n}}\n'''Freelensing''' is a photography technique used with [[Lens mount|interchangeable lens]] cameras in both film-based and digital photography. The lens is detached from the camera and held in front of the lens mount by hand during exposure. So the camera and lens don't have to be the same Brand, you can mix match brands, use vintage lenses. Any lens will work but if you want more depth of field use a lens that has a manual aperture ring. This allows the lens to be tilted or shifted creating a similar effect to a perspective control or \"Tilt-Shift\" lens, only with a lower degree of fidelity. The result is a combination of selective focus and light leakage which are used creatively to create surreal imagery. Because of the increase in [[flange focal distance]], this technique is most successful with closeup or macro photography, where [[infinity focus]] is not essential.\n\nThe lens used does not necessarily have to be native to the brand of camera, since it is not physically attached to it.

The lens is detached from the camera and held in front of the lens mount by hand during exposure. This allows the lens to be tilted or shifted creating a similar effect to a perspective control or \"Tilt-Shift\" lens, only with a lower degree of fidelity. The result is a combination of selective focus and light leakage which are used creatively to create surreal imagery. Because of the increase in [[flange focal distance]], this technique is most successful with closeup or macro photography, where [[infinity focus]] is not essential.\n\nThe lens used does not necessarily have to be native to the brand of camera, since it is not physically attached to it. In addition, the lens may also be reversed for [[macro photography]]. By shooting through a normal to wide-angle lens backwards, increased magnification can be achieved.

Martin Tonner, his father, was a self-educated engineer, and his mother, Virginia, a housewife.  Robert has one older brother, John; his twin brother, David; and a younger sister, Mary.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\">Finnegan, Stephanie. ''The Robert Tonner Story: Dreams and Dolls''.Portfolio Press 2000</ref>\n\nTonner's mother Virginia was plagued with several illnesses throughout her life, including; [[epilepsy]], [[encephalitis]], [[cancer of the kidney]] and [[myasthenia gravis]].  The continual cost of his mother's health-care would lead to very low economic and family stability throughout Tonner's childhood.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\"/>\n\nAs a child, Tonner turned to drawing and television as an escape from the difficult home-situation.  Programs such as ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'', ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'', ''[[Bonanza]]'', ''[[Bewitched]]'', as well as many comic book superheroes, such as the members of ''[[The Justice League]]'', would be his greatest inspiration.  At the age of eight, Tonner learned to sew.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\"/>\n\nTonner began his college career as a pre-med major, attending three different universities.  However, in 1973 the struggling student abandoned his goal of becoming a surgeon and decided to pursue his true passion of becoming a fashion designer.  That same year he would attend the [[Parsons School of Design]] in New York City.<ref name=\"autogenerated2000\"/>\n\n==Fashion career==\n\nIn 1975, at the age of 23, Tonner was hired as the Personal Assistant to Don Sayres, a designer for Gamut, a sportswear company located in New York City.  After three years with Gamut, Tonner accepted a position with fashion designer [[Bill Blass]] and was later asked to head the Blassport label. In 1983 Tonner launched his personal fashion label, \"Robert Tonner for Tudor Square\". \n\nAfter leaving the fashion industry, Tonner joined the National Institute of American Doll Artists (NIADA). He served as Standards chairman from 1991 to 1995 and was later elected President of NIADA 1995, a post which he held until 1997.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Finnegan, Stephanie.
