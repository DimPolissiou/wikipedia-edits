{"title_page": "Persecutions of the Catholic Church and Pius XII", "text_new": "{{Main article|Pope Pius XII}}\n{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]] took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two|World War II]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions \u2013 notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive, or resist or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]], persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216</ref> Bullock wrote: Hitler thought that Catholic teachings, taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218</ref> Bullock adds that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>\n\n{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church.

Following their 1939 invasion of West Poland, the Nazis instigated a policy of genocide against Poland's Jewish minority and of murdering or suppressing the ethnic Polish elites, including religious leaders. In 1940, Hitler proclaimed: \"Poles may have only one master \u2013 a German.

Treatment was at its most severe in the annexed regions, where churches were systematically closed and the majority of priests were either murdered, imprisoned or deported. Seminaries and convents were closed.<ref name=\"ushmm.org\"/>\n\nEighty per cent of the Catholic clergy and five bishops of Warthegau were sent to concentration camps in 1939, where 1,992 Polish clergy died throughout the period;<ref name=\"ushmm.org\"/> 108 from Warthegua are regarded as blessed martyrs.<ref name=\"Craughwell\"/> Around 1.5 million Poles were transported to work as forced labor in Germany.

In addition to the genocide of the Polish Jews, it is estimated that 1.8 to 1.9 million Polish civilians were killed during the German Occupation and the war.<ref name=\"ushmm.org\"/>\n\n====Elsewhere====\nDuring the [[Nazi occupation of the Netherlands]], the Dutch Bishops condemned the Nazi abduction of Jews. The Nazis retaliated with a series of repressive measures.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20684.pdf</ref> Many Catholics were involved in strikes and protests against the treatment of Jews, and the Nazis offered to exempt converts and Jews married to non-Jews if protests ceased. The [[Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands#Old Catholic Archbishops of Utrecht|Archbishop of Utrecht]] and other Catholics refused to comply, and the Nazis commenced a round up of all ethnically Jewish Catholics. Some 40,000 Jews were hidden by the Dutch church and 49 priests killed in the process.<ref name=\"catholiceducation.org\"/> Among the Catholics of the Netherlands abducted in this way was Saint [[Edith Stein]], who died at Auschwitz.\n\n===Japanese persecutions===\n{{expand section|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe expansion of Imperial Japan across the Asia Pacific from 1941 was accompanied by [[Japanese war crimes|many atrocities]] against Catholic missionaries, clerics, nuns, and lay people. Imperial Japan had developed [[State Shinto]] as the Imperial religion and promoted the notion of the [[Arahitogami|divinity of the Emperor]]. Japanese propaganda identified Catholics with European dominance \u2013 especially among Japan's own small Catholic community but also larger Asian communities in [[East Timor]], [[Korea]], [[French Indo-China]] the [[Dutch East Indies]], the [[Philippines]], [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Australian Papua and New Guinea]] and elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/column/non-european-catholics-and-world-war-two-1672|title=Non-European Catholics and World War Two - CNA Columns: Inside the Church during WWII|website=Catholic News Agency - By Harry Schnitker, Ph.D.|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nIn the majority Catholic Philippines, priests and seminarians were interned.<ref>http://www.jesuit.org/blog/index.php/tag/world-war-2/</ref> The five Columban priests killed at Malate are remembered as the [[Malate Martyrs]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.columban.org.au/media-and-publications/the-far-east-magazine/archive/2008/july/how-our-priests-died|title=How our six priests died in the Philippines|website=www.columban.org.au|language=en|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Territory of New Guinea|Australian New Guinea]], priests and religious were imprisoned in concentration camps.<ref name=\"asianews.it\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.asianews.it/news-en/The-Japanese-Church-apologizes-to-Papua:-Peter-To-Rot%E2%80%99s-death-is-our-fault-25276.html|title=The Japanese Church apologizes to Papua:|last=AsiaNews.it|website=www.asianews.it|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> From 1943, Japanese toleration of Christianity had shifted to confrontation.<ref name=\"Peter To Rot\">[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/to-rot-peter-11873 Peter To Rot]; Australian Dictionary of Biography; online 17 July 2014</ref> Troops interfered with Catholic religious practices and destroyed church buildings.<ref name=\"asianews.it\"/> Some 100 Catholics were killed for continuing to catechise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kwl.com.au/blog/theology/timeline-of-the-catholic-church-in-australia/|title=Timeline of The Catholic Church in Australia|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> The martyr [[Peter To Rot]] took up duties as a [[catechist]] after Japanese invaders imprisoned the local missionaries.

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref> In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities. He excommunicated all those who [[imprison]]ed [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]] and [[bishop]]s as in the case of Stepinac, Mindszenty, Gr\u00f6sz, Beran, Wyszinski and Pacha.<ref>Stepinac 10.14.1946, Mindszenty 12 28,1948, and 2 12, 1949,  Gosz 6 29, 1951, Beran 3 17, 1951, Wyszinski 9 30, 1953 and Pacha 9 17, 1951</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to prevent governmental usurpation of ecclesiastical offices, the Vatican threatened to [[excommunicate]] anyone who did so, or, illegally granted or received episcopal [[ordination]]. Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however. In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis|''Ad Apostolorum Principis'']] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]]; to the Vatican it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within months of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943. The Papal degree changed the [[ecclesiastical]] situation in China in an almost revolutionary way.<ref>Smit 188</ref> As the Church began to flourish, [[Pius XII]] established a local ecclesiastical hierarchy and received the Archbishop of Peking, [[Thomas Tien Ken-sin]], SVD, into the Sacred [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>Smit 188.</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, about four million Chinese were members of the Catholic faith. This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed. Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church had operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81,628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref> Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs to earn their living. Foreign missionaries were accused of being foreign agents who would turn the country over to imperialist forces.<ref>Giovanetti 232</ref>\n\n====Soviet Union====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Russia}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Lemko church.jpg|thumb|The Shelesto St Michael's wooden church (1777) is a classic example of Ruthenian architecture.]] -->\n\nRelations between Soviet authorities and the Vatican were always difficult.

Some, including Bishop Nicetas Budka, perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref> Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.\n\nWith the Catholic Church robbed of its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. [[Mass arrest]]s of priests followed. In [[Lemko]], some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref> Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries were closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi, 517</ref> Catholic United Churches were integrated under the [[Moscow Patriarchy]] after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested.<ref>Adrianyi, 518</ref> The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"[[peaceful coexistence]]\" became the subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for it. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical [[cooperation]] whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de[[-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] thwarted major results aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed the willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican, in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which was called identical with [[Kremlin]] policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref>\n\n==== Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia ====\nThe small Catholic churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945. All Church organizations were outlawed and all bishops jailed.<ref>Adrianyi, 514.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, Pope Pius received the ambassador of [[Lithuania]] for a final meeting prior to the Soviet occupation. At the outbreak of World War II there were 800 parishes, 1500 priests, and 600 candidates for the priesthood in four seminaries in Lithuania. As a part of the Soviet crackdown, the complete hierarchy, a large part of the clergy and about a third of the Catholic population was deported.<ref>Adrianyi, 515</ref>\n\n==== Poland ====\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and Poland}}\n[[File:Wyszy\u0144ski.jpg|thumb|right|Stefan Cardinal Wyszy\u0144ski was arrested from 1953 to 1956]]\n\nWith the war over, the Pope discontinued his war-time policy of neutrality, stating that he had abstained from protests during the war, in spite of massive persecutions.<ref>Giovannetti, 139</ref> The Communist Party of Poland assumed governmental control in 1947, and began to confiscate Church properties in the months thereafter. By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy.\nPope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter ''Flagranti Semper Animi'',<ref>January 18, 1948, AAS 1948, 324</ref> in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations. Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, [[Decennium Dum Expletur]]. He writes, that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, ten years afterwards, the suffering continues. [[Cum Jam Lustri]] commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha and gives courage to the Church in Poland. In honour of [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w|Saint Stanis\u0142aw]], Pope Pius XII issues [[Poloniae Annalibus]], giving consolation and again expressing his certain conviction, that Christ will win and the persecution will end. By 1952 some 1000 priests are incarcerated, all seminaries of [[religious institute]]s closed<ref>Giovannetti, 150</ref> On 19 November 1953 the pontiff addressed the [[Diplomatic Corps]] to issue a protest against the incarceration of Cardinal [[Stefan Wyszynski]].<ref>AAS, 1953, 755</ref> After the arrest of the Cardinal, Communist authorities support patriotic priests, who desire a separation from Rome. At the 300th anniversary of the successful defence of [[Jasna G\u00f3ra]], Pope Pius XII writes again to Poland, congratulating the courageous defenders of the faith in his time. [[Gloriosam Reginam]] salutes the modern day Polish martyrs and expresses confidence in victory of the queen of Poland. He salutes Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski upon his return from arrest in October 1956.\n\nIn 1957, Pope Pius addressed with ''[[Invicti athletae]]'' in strong words the Polish episcopate, which celebrated the 300th. Anniversary of the martyrdom of [[Saint]] [[Andrew Bobola]] through the Russians. \"The haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and his Church\" The Pope asks for endurance and bravery. The people and clergy must overcome many obstacles, and even sacrifices in time and money, but they must never give in.<ref>''Invicti athletae'', 29 in AAS 1957, 321 ff</ref> The Pope urges his bishops in Poland not to be overwhelmed by the situation but to mix [[courage]] with [[prudence]], and [[knowledge]] with [[wisdom]]:\n{{quote|Act boldly, but with that Christian promptness of soul, which goes hand in hand with prudence, knowledge, and wisdom.

They can turn you into martyrs, but they can never turn you into traitors''.<ref>AAS, XXXVII, 1945, 252</ref> In 1945, the [[Czechoslovakian]] government expelled its [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] and [[Germans|German]] populations from Czechoslovakian territories, thus greatly reducing the percentage of [[Catholics]] in the country. After its [[Czech coup|Communist coup in 1948]], Czechoslovakia expelled the [[Papal]] [[Nuncio]] and closed Catholic seminaries for the formation of priests. [[Prague]] outlawed all religious institutes and Catholic associations and gradually suppressed the Catholic press.<ref>Adrianyi, 525</ref> Attempts were made, to divide the clergy into opposing camps by creating a government-controlled association of priests headed by Bishop [[Joseph Plojhar]]. Archbishop [[Josef Beran]] and others refusing to participate were subjected to public [[show trial]]s and long incarcerations. In 1949, the governmental \"Church Office\" assumed all functions of the Catholic Church.\n\n==== Hungary ====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CardinalMindszenty.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Cardinal Mindszenty, New Brunswick, NJ]] -->\nAfter the occupation of Hungary by the [[Red Army]] in 1945, [[socialist]] policies gained only gradually ground in the country. But in the following five years, the Church lost three thousand and three-hundred [[schools]], numerous [[hospitals]] and [[newspapers]]. 11.500 [[Religious]] were asked to leave their convents and monasteries and institutes.<ref>Adrianyi, 528.</ref> The [[nuncio]] was expelled already in 1945. The Church attempted to come to agreements with the government in 1950, when the continuation of about ten Catholic schools was permitted. The overwhelming experience of Hungarian Catholicism were the public show trials and degradations of Archbishop [[Jozsef Grosz]] and Cardinal [[Jozsef Mindszenty]]. They resulted in a complete exclusion of the Church from all public life and Hungarian society.<ref>Adrianyi 529</ref>\n\n===== Jozsef Mindszenty =====\n[[Jozsef Mindszenty]] had been jailed by the [[Germany|Germans]], freed by the Soviet army and was ordained [[Bishop]] in 1944. After coup of the communist party in Hungary, a reign of [[state terrorism|terror]] backed by the Soviet army was instituted<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/>\nPope Pius XII named Mindzenty [[Primate of Hungary]] and received him in the [[College of Cardinals]] in 1946. \"After a propaganda campaign, he was arrested on charges of collaboration with the Nazis, spying, treason, and [[currency]] [[fraud]]. None of the accusations were true. He was [[torture]]d, mentally and physically, beaten daily with rubber truncheons until he signed a [[Confession (religion)|confession]]. His show trial was condemned by the [[United Nations]]... The trumped up proceedings, fully reported in the West, gripped and horrified Catholics the world over.\"<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\"/> The Cardinal remained in prison until 1956, when, during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] he was freed. After the failure of the revolution, he lived in the American embassy for the following 15 years.\n\n==== Romania, Bulgaria and Albania ====\n[[File:Blaj s3.jpg|thumb|Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n[[File:Blaj s2.jpg|thumb|The interior of the Sf\u00e2nta Treime Romanian Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral]]\n\nAfter World War I, Romania inherited large parts of Catholic Hungary including large Catholic populations, which were not always treated well between the wars.<ref>Adryani 530</ref> The [[Apostolic Constitution]] ''Solemmni Conventione'' of 1930 includes a [[concordat]] between Romania and the Vatican.<ref>AAS 1930, 381</ref> It allowed for four dioceses and free exercise of religion within the country. Because of rival interpretations the concordat was enacted ten years later in 1940. In 1948, the Communist government withdrew from the concordat and closed most Catholic institutes. Only two small dioceses were permitted to continue, the others were considered non-existent.<ref>Adrianyi,531</ref> The six united bishops and several Latin rite bishops were jailed to long sentences. All schools were closed, Catholic activities were outlawed.<ref>Adrianyi,532.</ref><ref>''[[Orientales Ecclesias]]'', Acta Apostolicae Sedis (AAS), Roma, Vaticano, 1953, 5.</ref>\n\nBulgaria became a [[People's Republic]] on 15 October 1946. The new [[constitution]] of 1947 limited religious activities. Massive Church persecution followed. The Church lost all its bishops, organizations, religious institutes. Most of the priests and religious perished within five years,<ref>Adrianyi, 536</ref> many of them in Siberia.\n\nIn Albania, the Communist government assumed the role of liberator, since the country was under [[Italy|Italian]] [[Military occupation|occupation]] since 1939. The Catholic Church was denounced as the Church of the [[oppression|oppressor]]s. All foreign priests and religious were expelled. Domestic bishops, priests and religious were killed, jailed or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929,  [[Muslim]]s in 1931, [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican. After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref> The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other socialist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated among them 139 Franciscan friar, 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy. A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\", this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times. The Pope explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref> Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome, and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him. After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15500 priests, religious and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\"<ref>Dammertz 376</ref> The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"Untermenschen\", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan friar [[Maximilian Kolbe]].\n[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]\nIn the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger. Between April and October 1942, 500 Polish religious died in Dachau, in part due to mistreatment, hunger or the gas chambers.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\">HK 1960, 27</ref> Long-time inmate Bishop Kozlowiecki reports: \"What a happy day, if I was beaten only once or twice\". Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\"/> Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors, which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.<ref>Pio XII, Discorsi VII, 1945,  Roma, Vaticano, 74</ref>\n\nAfter 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions, their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\nIn all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions. All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well. In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950.<ref>Dammertz 377</ref> In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months. Some 300 were permitted to remain.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> The Hungarian hierarchy entered an agreement with the authorities, which permitted the reopening of eight Catholic schools<ref>Galter, 345\u2013353,</ref><ref>Herder Korrespondenz, 5, 1950, 33</ref>\n\nIn [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], all orders were closed after the war and properties confiscated. In [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate. In China and [[North Korea]] Catholic religious no longer existed. Foreign missionaries were expelled, the fate of most local religious is unknown.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\n== Decrees of the Holy Office on Communism ==\n{{Main article|Decree against Communism}}\nThe Vatican, having been silent during the war on communist excesses, displayed a harder line on communism after 1945.\n\n== Encyclicals of Pope Pius XII on Church persecutions ==\nThe name of a Papal Encyclical is always taken from its [[incipit|first two or three words]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| No.\n! colspan=2| Title\n! rowspan=2| Subject\n! rowspan=2| Date\n! rowspan=2| Text\n|-\n!

Church}}\nPersecutions against the [[Catholic Church]] took place throughout the pontificate of [[Pope Pius XII]] (1939-1958). Pius' reign coincided with the [[World War II|Second World War]], the commencement of the [[Cold War]] and the accelerating European [[Decolonization of Africa|decolonisation]]. During this time, the Catholic Church faced persecution under [[Fascism|Fascist]] and [[Communism|Communist]] governments.\n\nThe Nazi persecution of the church was at its most extreme in [[German-occupied Poland|Occupied Poland]]. The defeat of Fascism at the end of [[World War Two|World War II]] ended one set of persecutions, but strengthened the position of Communism throughout the world, intensifying a further set of persecutions \u2013 notably in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[USSR]], and, later, the [[People's Republic of China]]. The Catholic Church was under attack in all [[Communist]] governed countries and lost most of its existence in [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], [[Romania]], Communist China and the Soviet Union (including [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]).\n\n== Summary ==\nThe pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the Second World War (1939-1945) and the early stages of the Cold War. The Catholic Church was repressed under the Nazi Empire and then under the Soviet dominated Communist states established in Eastern and Central Europe following the war. The Catholic Church in Germany was systematically repressed by the Nazis and persecution was at its most severe in Nazi occupied Poland, where churches, seminaries, monasteries and convents were systematically closed and thousands of priests and nuns were either murdered, imprisoned or deported.\n\nAccording to [[John Cornwell (writer)|John Cornwell]], the Church was faced with a dilemma: compromise with the governments in order to maintain a structure with which to survive, or resist or confront and risk annihilation.<ref name=\"Cornwell 333\">Cornwell 333</ref> To save its faithful, the Vatican attempted both at varying times.\n\nIn [[East Germany]] and [[Hungary]], the Church was subjected to ongoing attacks, but was able to continue some of its activities, however on a much reduced scale. In [[Albania]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]], persecution continued to the point that the Church faced extinction. In the Soviet Union and mainland China, the Catholic Church largely ceased to exist, at least publicly, during the [[pontificate]] of Pope Pius XII.\n\n==Fascist persecutions==\n===Nazi persecutions===\n\n====Germany====\n\nThe Catholic Church had been a leading opponent of the rise of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party]] through the 1920s and early 1930s. Upon taking power in 1933, and despite the [[Reichskonkordat|Concordat]] it signed with the church promising the contrary, the Nazi Government of [[Adolf Hitler]] began suppressing the Catholic Church as part of an overall policy of to eliminate competing sources of authority. The Nazis arrested thousands of members of the German [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]] as well as Catholic clergymen and closed Catholic schools and institutions. As the [[Third Reich]] expanded, thousands more Catholic priests were imprisoned or killed and Catholic institutions disbanded by the Nazis.<ref>http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/about/01/non_jews_persecution.asp</ref>\n\nAccording to Hitler's biographer [[Alan Bullock]], Hitler was a \"man who believed neither in God nor in conscience ('a Jewish invention, a blemish like circumcision')\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p216</ref> Bullock wrote: Hitler thought that Catholic teachings, taken to their conclusion, \"would mean the systematic cultivation of the human failure\".<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p218</ref> Bullock adds that \"once the war was over, [Hitler] promised himself, he would root out and destroy the influence of the Christian churches, but until then he would be circumspect\":<ref>[[Alan Bullock]]; ''Hitler, a Study in Tyranny''; HarperPerennial Edition 1991; p219</ref>\n\n{{quote|Hitler had been brought up a Catholic and was impressed by the organisation and power of the Church.

Smuggled into Germany to avoid prior censorship and read from the pulpits of all German Catholic churches, it condemned Nazi ideology<ref>Frattini, p. 230</ref> as \"insane and arrogant\".

Following their 1939 invasion of West Poland, the Nazis instigated a policy of genocide against Poland's Jewish minority and of murdering or suppressing the ethnic Polish elites, including religious leaders. In 1940, Hitler proclaimed: \"Poles may have only one master \u2013 a German.

As previously with Germany under the National Socialist government, Pope Pius refused to break diplomatic relations with Communist authorities.<ref>Before 1939, as Secretary of State, he had debated this point with [[Pope Pius XI]]. Pacelli argued, that a break of diplomatic relations means losing all contacts with the local hierarchy and, eventually, paying a much higher price:\n\n* Pius XI asked me, how can the [[Holy See]]  keep its [[nuncio]] there?  This is against our honour. I answered: Your Holiness,  what do we do afterwards? How do we maintain any contacts with our bishops?  He understood and calmed down. (Actes et documents Vol II, p.424)</ref>\n\nThus, after World War II, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept its nuncios in Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, [[Romania]] and China, until these countries severed relations interrupting communication with bishops as well. The Vatican responded by giving local bishops unprecedented authority to deal with authorities on their own, but without granting the right to define overall relations, viewed as the sole privilege of the Holy See.<ref>Letter of Monsignor Tardini to the Archbishop of Belgrad, 2 16, 1952, in HK VII, 1952 447</ref> In encyclicals such as ''[[Invicti athletae]]'', and Apostolic letters to Czech Bishops, Polish Bishops, the Bishops of Hungary, China, and Romania,<ref>Czechoslovakia AAS 1948 33, Poland AAS 1949 29,    Hungary AAS 1952 249, China AAS 1952 153, Romania AAS 1947, 223</ref> the Pope encouraged local bishops to be firm, modest and wise in their dealings with the new communist authorities.

Nevertheless, the Vatican was not successful in blocking episcopal enthronements by the governments of China and Czechoslovakia. These persons were not excommunicated, however. In his last encyclical [[Ad Apostolorum Principis|''Ad Apostolorum Principis'']] to the bishops of China, Pope Pius XII expressed the opinion that schismatic bishops and priests are the final step towards total elimination of the Catholic Church in that country.<ref>AAS 1958 601</ref> Questions were raised as to why the Vatican appointed powerful but often inexperienced American bishops as nuncios in some Eastern countries, given the anti-American, anti-imperialist tendencies in these countries.<ref>see Stehle, Ostpolitik</ref> While there is no documentation on Vatican motives, a possible reason could be the relative security of US nationals in foreign countries.\n\n=== Persecutions and Church policies ===\n==== China ====\n[[File:Sacr\u00e9-C\u0153ur de Shizhi.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sacred Heart Cathedral of Guangzhou]]]]\n{{Main article|Pope Pius XII and China}}\n\nFor centuries, access to the people of China was difficult for the Catholic Church, because it did not recognize local [[Confucian]] customs of honouring deceased family members. To the Chinese, this was an [[ancient]] [[ritual]]; to the Vatican it was a [[religious]] exercise which conflicted with [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[dogma]]. As a result, the Church made little progress in China. Within months of his election, Pope Pius issued a dramatic change in policies. On 8 December 1939 the Sacred Congregation of the Propagation of Faith issued, at the request of Pius XII, a new instruction by which Chinese customs were no longer considered [[superstitious]], but an honourable way of esteeming ones relatives and therefore permitted by Catholic Christians.<ref>Smit 186\u2013187.</ref> The [[Government of the Republic of China|Government of China]] established diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1943. The Papal degree changed the [[ecclesiastical]] situation in China in an almost revolutionary way.<ref>Smit 188</ref> As the Church began to flourish, [[Pius XII]] established a local ecclesiastical hierarchy and received the Archbishop of Peking, [[Thomas Tien Ken-sin]], SVD, into the Sacred [[College of Cardinals]].<ref>Smit 188.</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, about four million Chinese were members of the Catholic faith. This was less than one percent of the population but numbers increased dramatically. In 1949, there existed 20 archdioceses, 85 dioceses, 39 apostolic prefectures, 3080 foreign missionaries, 2557 Chinese priests.<ref>Giovanetti 230</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1949 put these early advances on hold and led to the [[persecution]] of thousands of clergy and faithful in China. A patriotic Chinese Church was formed. Since that time, the persecuted Catholic Church exists as a tiny fraction in secrecy and underground only. The losses were considerable. For example, in 1948, the Catholic Church had operated some 254 orphanages and 196 hospitals with 81,628 beds.<ref>Herder Korrespondenz 5, 201</ref> Catholic clergy experienced increased supervision. Bishops and priests were forced to engage in degrading menial jobs to earn their living.

At once, the United Catholic Churches of [[Armenia]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Ruthenia]] were attacked.\n\n==== Catholic Ruthenian and Ukrainian Churches ====\nSoviet attempts to separate the United Churches from Rome reflected not only Soviet policy, but were a continuation of centuries-old Russian policies towards the papacy, already viewed as [[anti-Russian]].<ref>see main article, Pope Pius IX, Pope Leo XIII</ref> Pius also was aware that, in months preceding the [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientales omnes Ecclesias]]'', all Catholic bishops of the Ukrainian Church had been arrested, including [[Josyf Slipyj]], [[Gregory Chomysyn, John Laysevkyi, Nicolas Carneckyi, Josaphat Kocylovskyi]]. Some, including Bishop Nicetas Budka, perished in Siberia.<ref>Giovannetti, 131</ref> Subjected to Stalinist [[Show Trials]], they all received severe sentencing. The remaining leaders of the hierarchies and heads of all seminaries and episcopal offices were arrested and tried in 1945 and 1946.\n\nWith the Catholic Church robbed of its leadership, a \"spontaneous movement\" for separation from Rome and unification with the Russian Orthodox Church developed. [[Mass arrest]]s of priests followed. In [[Lemko]], some five hundred priests were jailed in 1945<ref>Giovannetti, 90</ref> or sent to a Gulag, officially called \"an unknown destination because of political reasons\".<ref>Smit, 174</ref> Church institutions were confiscated and expropriated; churches, monasteries and seminaries were closed and looted,<ref>Adrianyi, 517</ref> Catholic United Churches were integrated under the [[Moscow Patriarchy]] after all residing bishops and apostolic administrators were arrested.<ref>Adrianyi, 518</ref> The Catholic Church of the Ukraine was thus liquidated and its properties turned over to the Orthodox Church under the [[Patriarch of Moscow]].\n\nAfter Joseph Stalin died in 1953, \"[[peaceful coexistence]]\" became the subject of numerous discussions. In his Christmas Message of 1954, Pius XII defined possibilities and preconditions for it. He indicated Vatican willingness to practical [[cooperation]] whenever possible in the interest of the faithful. The slow pace of de[[-Stalinisation]] and the Soviet crack-down of the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Revolution]] thwarted major results aside from modest improvements in Poland and Yugoslavia after 1956. In January 1958, Soviet Foreign Minister [[Andrey Gromyko]] expressed the willingness of Moscow to have formal relations with the Vatican, in light of the position of Pope Pius XII on world peace and the uses of atomic energy for peaceful purposes, a position which was called identical with [[Kremlin]] policy.<ref>Giovannetti,  88</ref>\n\n==== Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia ====\nThe small Catholic Churches of Estonia and the Church in Latvia were completely annihilated after the Soviet Union reintegrated these countries into its territory in 1945.

Catholic Lithuania suffered especially in the Soviet Union. At the outbreak of World War II there were 800 parishes, 1500 priests, 600 candidates for the priesthood in four seminaries.

By late 1947, Catholic educational institutes, kindergartens, schools, orphanages were expropriated as well. Starting in 1948, mass arrest and show trials began to take place against Catholic bishops and clergy.\nPope Pius XII responded with an apostolic letter ''Flagranti Semper Animi'',<ref>January 18, 1948, AAS 1948, 324</ref> in which he defended the Church against attacks and Stalinist persecution tactics. However, pressures against the Church increased with the de facto outlawing of religious meetings and organizations. Pope Pius responded with a letter commemorating the 10th anniversary of the beginning of World War II, [[Decennium Dum Expletur]]. He writes, that while the Polish people had suffered like nobody else during the war, ten years afterwards, the suffering continues. [[Cum Jam Lustri]] commemorates the death of two Polish Cardinals, Hlond and Sapieha and gives courage to the Church in Poland. In honour of [[Stanislaus of Szczepan\u00f3w|Saint Stanis\u0142aw]], Pope Pius XII issues [[Poloniae Annalibus]], giving consolation and again expressing his certain conviction, that Christ will win and the persecution will end.

At the 300th anniversary of the successful defence of [[Jasna G\u00f3ra]], Pope Pius XII writes again to Poland, congratulating the courageous defenders of the faith in his time. [[Gloriosam Reginam]] salutes the modern day Polish martyrs and expresses confidence in victory of the queen of Poland. He salutes Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski upon his return from arrest in October 1956.\n\nIn 1957, Pope Pius addressed with ''[[Invicti athletae]]'' in strong words the Polish episcopate, which celebrated the 300th. Anniversary of the martyrdom of [[Saint]] [[Andrew Bobola]] through the Russians. \"The haters of God and enemies of Christian teaching attack Jesus Christ and his Church\" The Pope asks for endurance and bravery.

Domestic bishops, priests and religious were killed, jailed or sent to unknown destinations. As in other countries, a peace-loving national Church was attempted as well. The government prided itself on having eradicated religion and closed every Catholic Church.<ref>Adrianyi,536</ref>\n\n==== Yugoslavia ====\nAfter defining relations with the [[Orthodox Church]] in 1929,  [[Muslim]]s in 1931, [[Protestant]]s and [[Jew]]s in 1933, a [[Concordat]] was signed in 1935 between Yugoslavia and the Vatican. After the Orthodox Church excommunicated all politicians involved in its parliamentary passing, the government withdrew the text from final vote in the upper house. De Facto however, the spirit of the concordat was accepted and the Church began to flourish in the years prior to World War II.<ref>Adrianyi,533</ref> The war was difficult for the Church, as the country was largely occupied by Italian and German forces. The [[Independent State of Croatia]], which declared independence from the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], was open to the needs of the Church, which led to open [[collaboration]] of several Church officials with Croatian government policies.\n\nAfter the war, the systematic persecution of the Church began as it did in all the other socialist countries. Some 1300 of the clergy was assassinated among them 139 Franciscan friar, 50% of the clergy was jailed.<ref>Adrianyi,534</ref> As in Czechoslovakia and other countries, Belgrade created government-controlled organizations of priests, in an attempt to divide the clergy. A major bone of contention was [[Aloysius Stepinac]], who was elevated to the College of Cardinals in 1953. To President Tito \"a provocation\", this represented to Pope Pius \"a just recognition of his extraordinary merits and a symbol of our affection and encouragement for our beloved sons and daughters, who testify their faith with steadfastness and courage in very difficult times. The Pope explained that he did not intend to insult the Yugoslavian authorities, but neither did he agree with any of the unjust accusations which resulted in the punishment of the Archbishop.<ref>Pio XII Discorsi, 1952, January 12, 1953</ref> Stepinac was not permitted to receive the red hat in Rome, and remained under house arrest (unable to participate in the 1958 conclave) until his death in 1960. [[Pope John Paul II]] beatified him. After his death, relations to the Vatican improved significantly. In 1974, the Church in Yugoslavia counted 15500 priests, religious and nuns<ref>HK 1977,318\u2013324</ref>\n\n=== Persecution of religious institutes ===\n[[Religious institute]]s and institutions are historically visible targets in time of conflict and strife. Their houses, convents or monasteries were looted, burned or destroyed throughout Europe for centuries in virtually all European countries. The beginning of the pontificate of Pius XII coincided with the end of the Civil War in Spain, in which, in addition to thousands of faithful, some 4184 secular priests, 2365 religious and 283 female religious were killed within a three-year period.<ref>Dammertz 375</ref>\n\nIn World War II, the [[religious (Catholicism)|religious]] of Poland suffered from an exceptionally brutal German occupation. A 1940 thirteen-point program provided that \"all religious institutes, convents and monasteries will be closed because they do not reflect German morality and population policy.\"<ref>Dammertz 376</ref> The German policy, to treat Poles as subhuman \"Untermenschen\", was especially brutal against representatives of religious orders. [[Gestapo]] raids let to the murdering, assassination and deportation to concentration camps of numerous religious, including the Franciscan friar [[Maximilian Kolbe]].\n[[File:Chapel of Saint Kazimieras with his sarcophagus in Vilnius Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Chapel of [[Saint Casimir]] with his coffin in Vilnius, Lithuania]]\nIn the [[Dachau concentration camp]] alone, some 2800 Polish priests and religious were incarcerated, of whom approximately 1000 were killed or died of hunger. Between April and October 1942, 500 Polish religious died in Dachau, in part due to mistreatment, hunger or the gas chambers.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\">HK 1960, 27</ref> Long-time inmate Bishop Kozlowiecki reports: \"What a happy day, if I was beaten only once or twice\". Especially brutal was Holy Week in 1942. One thousand and eight hundred Polish priests and religious went through punishment drills and exercises uninterrupted from morning to night every day.<ref name=\"HK 1960, 27\"/> Pope Pius XII informed the cardinals in 1945 that among all the horrors, which priests and religious had to endure in concentration camps, the fate of Polish inmates was by far the worst.<ref>Pio XII, Discorsi VII, 1945,  Roma, Vaticano, 74</ref>\n\nAfter 1945, Poland was resurrected, but the Polish government continued the attacks against the Catholic Church. All religious were forced to leave hospitals and educational institutions, their properties were confiscated. Within seven years, fifty-four religious were killed. One hundred and seventy priests were deported to gulags.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> However, after a change of government in 1956, the condition of the Church improved. Harassment and persecution of the Church continued but religious vocations were permitted and Poland became the only Eastern country which contributed in great numbers religious missionaries to worldwide service.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\nIn all East European countries, after World War II, persecution of religious assumed new dimensions. All religious houses in the Ukraine were confiscated and their inhabitants either jailed or sent home. All religious houses were confiscated and closed in Lithuania as well. In Albania, all religious orders were forcibly closed. In Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia, all monasteries and religious institutes were erased after 1950.<ref>Dammertz 377</ref> In Hungary, 10,000 members of religious orders were ordered to leave their residences within three months. Some 300 were permitted to remain.<ref>Dammertz 378</ref> The Hungarian hierarchy entered an agreement with the authorities, which permitted the reopening of eight Catholic schools<ref>Galter, 345\u2013353,</ref><ref>Herder Korrespondenz, 5, 1950, 33</ref>\n\nIn [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], all orders were closed after the war and properties confiscated. In [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], numerous religious figures were killed, among them 139 Franciscan priests. However, as Yugoslavia distanced itself increasingly from Moscow, significant improvements were noticed in [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] during the last two years of the Pacelli pontificate. In China and [[North Korea]] Catholic religious no longer existed. Foreign missionaries were expelled, the fate of most local religious is unknown.<ref>Dammertz 379</ref>\n\n== Decrees of the Holy Office on Communism ==\n{{Main article|Decree against Communism}}\nThe Vatican, having been silent during the war on communist excesses, displayed a harder line on communism after 1945.\n\n== Encyclicals of Pope Pius XII on Church persecutions ==\nThe name of a Papal Encyclical is always taken from its [[incipit|first two or three words]].\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| No.\n! colspan=2| Title\n! rowspan=2| Subject\n! rowspan=2| Date\n! rowspan=2| Text\n|-\n!

Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC&pg=PA163 ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt''], David Frankfurter, BRILL, 1998, {{ISBN|90-04-11127-1}}, page 163</ref>\n\nThe Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' \u2013 Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&lpg=PA60&pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher=University of California Press |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-520-07196-4 |pages=60\u201361 }}</ref> The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the region starting from [[Cilicia]], where the Euphrates river makes its descent into [[Syria]], through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.<ref>See for example Palestine: The Reality, [[Joseph Mary Nagle Jeffries]], Published by Longmans, Green and co., 1939, [https://archive.org/details/PalestineTheReality/page/n4/mode/1up Page 11]</ref>\n\n''The provinces of Arabia were:'' Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hedjaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.<ref>see Review of Reviews and World's Work: An International Magazine, Albert Shaw ed., The Review of Reviews Corporation, 1919, page 408]</ref><ref name=nie>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GRUoAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA795&pg=PA795|title=New International Encyclopedia \u2013 2nd Edition, Dodd, Mead, Co., 1914 |page= 795|work=google.com|year=1914 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:HistoricCoins.jpg|thumb|Ancient coins from [[Failaka Island]], [[Kuwait]]]]\nThe history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 130,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uerpmann|first=Hans-Peter|last2=Usik|first2=Vitaly I.|last3=Parker|first3=Adrian G.|last4=Marks|first4=Anthony E.|last5=Jasim|first5=Sabah A.|last6=Armitage|first6=Simon J.|date=2011-01-28|title=The Southern Route \"Out of Africa\": Evidence for an Early Expansion of Modern Humans into Arabia|journal=Science|language=en|volume=331|issue=6016|pages=453\u2013456|doi=10.1126/science.1199113|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21273486}}</ref> However, a [[Homo sapiens]] fossilized finger bone was found at [[Al Wusta (Saudi Arabia)|Al Wusta]] in the [[Nefud Desert]], which indicates that the first human migration out of Africa to Arabia might date back to approximately 90,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-04/mpif-fhm040418.php|title=First human migration out of Africa more geographically widespread than previously thought|work=Eurek Alert|date=9 April 2018}}</ref> Nevertheless, the stone tools from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] age along with fossils of other animals discovered at Ti's al Ghadah, in northwestern Saudi Arabia, might imply that hominids migrated through a \"Green Arabia\" between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Roberts | first1=Patrick | last2=Stewart | first2=Mathew | last3=Alagaili | first3=Abdulaziz N. | last4=Breeze | first4=Paul | last5=Candy | first5=Ian | last6=Drake | first6=Nick | last7=Groucutt | first7=Huw S. | last8=Scerri | first8=Eleanor M.

From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India. The political focus of the Muslim world then shifted to the newly conquered territories.<ref>See: Holt (1977a), p.57, Hourani (2003), p.22, Lapidus (2002), p.32, Madelung (1996), p.43, Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref><ref name=\"L.

Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the [[Hejaz]]. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the [[Hejaz]], they were usually subject to the [[suzerainty]] of one of the major Islamic empires of the time. In the Middle Ages, these included the [[Abbasids]] of [[Baghdad]], and the [[Fatimids]], [[Ayyubids]] and [[Mamluks]] of Egypt.<ref name=\"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online: History of Arabia\">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/31568/history-of-Arabia Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online: History of Arabia] retrieved 18 January 2011</ref>\n\n[[File:Ottoman empire.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Ottoman territories acquired between 1481 and 1683 ([[List of Ottoman Empire dominated territories|See: list of territories]])]]\n===Modern history===\n\nThe provincial Ottoman Army for Arabia (Arabistan Ordusu) was headquartered in [[Syria (region)|Syria]], which included Palestine, the Transjordan region in addition to Lebanon ([[Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate|Mount Lebanon was, however, a semi-autonomous mutasarrifate]]).

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed.

Most areas are drained by ephemeral watercourses called [[wadi]]s, which are dry except during the rainy season. Plentiful ancient [[aquifer]]s exist beneath much of the peninsula, however, and where this water surfaces, [[oases]] form (e.g. Al-Hasa and [[Qatif]], two of the world's largest [[oases]]) and permit agriculture, especially [[palm trees]], which allowed the peninsula to produce more [[date palm|dates]] than any other region in the world. In general, the climate is extremely hot and [[Desert|arid]], although there are exceptions. Higher elevations are made temperate by their altitude, and the Arabian Sea coastline can receive surprisingly cool, humid breezes in summer due to cold upwelling offshore. The peninsula has no thick forests. Desert-adapted wildlife is present throughout the region.\n\nAccording to NASA's [[Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment]] (GRACE) satellite data (2003\u20132013) analysed in a [[University of California, Irvine|University of California, Irvine (UCI)]]-led study published in [[Water Resources Research]] on 16 June 2015, the most over-stressed aquifer system in the world is the [[Arabian Aquifer System]], upon which more than 60 million people depend for water.<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\">{{citation |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4626 |work=NASA |date=16 June 2015 |accessdate=26 June 2015 |title=Study: Third of Big Groundwater Basins in Distress}}</ref> Twenty-one of the thirty seven largest aquifers \"have exceeded sustainability tipping points and are being depleted\" and thirteen of them are \"considered significantly distressed\".<ref name=\"NASA_GRACE\" />\n\nA plateau more than {{convert|2500|ft|m}} high extends across much of the Arabian Peninsula.

The narrow coastal plain and isolated oases, amounting to less than 1% of the land area, are used to cultivate grains, [[coffee]] and [[tropical fruit]]s. Goat, sheep, and [[camel]] husbandry is widespread elsewhere throughout the rest of the Peninsula. Some areas have a summer humid [[tropical monsoon climate]], in particular the [[Dhofar]] and [[Al Mahrah]] areas of Oman and Yemen. These areas allow for large scale coconut plantations. Much of Yemen has a tropical [[monsoon]] rain influenced mountain climate. The plains usually have either a tropical or subtropical arid [[desert climate]] or arid [[steppe climate]]. The sea surrounding the Arabian Peninsula is generally [[Coral Sea|tropical sea]] with a very rich tropical sea life and some of the world's largest, undestroyed and most pristine coral reefs. In addition, the organisms living in [[symbiosis]] with the Red Sea coral, the [[protozoa]] and [[zooxanthellae]], have a unique hot weather adaptation to sudden rise (and fall) in sea water temperature. Hence, these coral reefs are not affected by coral bleaching caused by rise in temperature as elsewhere in the [[indopacific]] coral sea. The reefs are also unaffected by mass tourism and diving or other large scale human interference. However, some reefs were destroyed in the [[Persian Gulf]], mostly caused by phosphate water [[pollution]] and resultant increase in algae growth as well as oil pollution from ships and pipeline leakage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nThe fertile soils of Yemen have encouraged settlement of almost all of the land from sea level up to the mountains at {{convert|10000|ft|m}}. In the higher reaches, elaborate terraces have been constructed to facilitate grain, fruit, coffee, ginger and [[khat]] cultivation. The Arabian peninsula is known for its rich oil, i.e. petroleum production due to its geographical location.{{cn|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Etymology==<!--linked-->\n{{main article|Arab (etymology)}}\nDuring the [[Hellenistic]] period, the area was known as ''Arabia'' or ''Aravia'' ({{lang-el|\u0391\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03af\u03b1}}). The [[ancient Rome|Romans]] named three regions with the prefix \"Arabia\", encompassing a larger area than the current term \"Arabian Peninsula\":\n* [[Arabia Petraea]]: for the area that is today southern modern [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], the [[Sinai Peninsula]] and northwestern [[Saudi Arabia]]. It was the only one that became a [[Roman province|province]], with [[Petra]] as its capital.\n* [[Arabia Deserta]] (\"Desert Arabia\"): signified the desert interior of the Arabian peninsula. As a name for the region, it remained popular into the 19th and 20th centuries, and was used in [[Charles M. Doughty]]'s ''[[Travels in Arabia Deserta]]'' (1888).\n* [[Arabia Felix]] (\"Fortunate Arabia\"): was used by geographers to describe what is now [[Yemen]], which enjoys more rainfall, is much greener than the rest of the peninsula and has long enjoyed much more productive fields.\n\nThe Arab inhabitants used a north-south division of Arabia: Al Sham-Al Yaman, or Arabia Deserta-Arabia Felix. Arabia Felix had originally been used for the whole peninsula, and at other times only for the southern region. Because its use became limited to the south, the whole peninsula was simply called Arabia. Arabia Deserta was the entire desert region extending north from Arabia Felix to Palmyra and the Euphrates, including all the area between Pelusium on the Nile and Babylon. This area was also called Arabia and not sharply distinguished from the peninsula.<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=3yENB_dXAtwC&pg=PA163 ''Pilgrimage and Holy Space in Late Antique Egypt''], David Frankfurter, BRILL, 1998, {{ISBN|90-04-11127-1}}, page 163</ref>\n\nThe Arabs and the Ottoman Empire considered the west of the Arabian Peninsula region where the Arabs lived 'the land of the Arabs' \u2013 Bilad al-Arab (Arabia), and its major divisions were the bilad al-Sham (Syria), bilad al-Yaman (the Land of the southern Peninsula), and Bilad al-Iraq and modern-day Kuwait (the Land of the River Banks).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4vOJ15vTZV4C&lpg=PA60&pg=PA60|title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |first=Kamal Suleiman |last=Salibi |publisher=University of California Press |date=1988 |isbn=978-0-520-07196-4 |pages=60\u201361 }}</ref> The Ottomans used the term Arabistan in a broad sense for the region starting from [[Cilicia]], where the Euphrates river makes its descent into [[Syria]], through [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], and on through the remainder of the Sinai and Arabian peninsulas.<ref>See for example Palestine: The Reality, [[Joseph Mary Nagle Jeffries]], Published by Longmans, Green and co., 1939, [https://archive.org/details/PalestineTheReality/page/n4/mode/1up Page 11]</ref>\n\n''The provinces of Arabia were:'' Al Tih, the Sinai peninsula, Hedjaz, Asir, Yemen, Hadramaut, Mahra and Shilu, Oman, Hasa, Bahrain, Dahna, Nufud, the Hammad, which included the deserts of Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia.<ref>see Review of Reviews and World's Work: An International Magazine, Albert Shaw ed., The Review of Reviews Corporation, 1919, page 408]</ref><ref name=nie>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=GRUoAAAAYAAJ&lpg=PA795&pg=PA795|title=New International Encyclopedia \u2013 2nd Edition, Dodd, Mead, Co., 1914 |page= 795|work=google.com|year=1914 }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:HistoricCoins.jpg|thumb|Ancient coins from [[Failaka Island]], [[Kuwait]]]]\nThe history of the Arabian Peninsula goes back to the beginnings of human habitation in Arabia up to 130,000 years ago.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Uerpmann|first=Hans-Peter|last2=Usik|first2=Vitaly I.|last3=Parker|first3=Adrian G.|last4=Marks|first4=Anthony E.|last5=Jasim|first5=Sabah A.|last6=Armitage|first6=Simon J.|date=2011-01-28|title=The Southern Route \"Out of Africa\": Evidence for an Early Expansion of Modern Humans into Arabia|journal=Science|language=en|volume=331|issue=6016|pages=453\u2013456|doi=10.1126/science.1199113|issn=0036-8075|pmid=21273486}}</ref> However, a [[Homo sapiens]] fossilized finger bone was found at [[Al Wusta (Saudi Arabia)|Al Wusta]] in the [[Nefud Desert]], which indicates that the first human migration out of Africa to Arabia might date back to approximately 90,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-04/mpif-fhm040418.php|title=First human migration out of Africa more geographically widespread than previously thought|work=Eurek Alert|date=9 April 2018}}</ref> Nevertheless, the stone tools from the [[Middle Paleolithic]] age along with fossils of other animals discovered at Ti's al Ghadah, in northwestern Saudi Arabia, might imply that hominids migrated through a \"Green Arabia\" between 300,000 and 500,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Roberts | first1=Patrick | last2=Stewart | first2=Mathew | last3=Alagaili | first3=Abdulaziz N. | last4=Breeze | first4=Paul | last5=Candy | first5=Ian | last6=Drake | first6=Nick | last7=Groucutt | first7=Huw S. | last8=Scerri | first8=Eleanor M.

The [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] was born in Mecca in about 570 and first began preaching in the city in 610, but [[Hijra (Islam)|migrated]] to [[Medina]] in 622. From there he and his companions united the [[tribes of Arabia]] under the banner of [[Islam]] and created a single Arab Muslim religious polity in the Arabian peninsula.\n\nMuhammad established a new unified polity in the Arabian peninsula which under the subsequent [[Rashidun]] and [[Umayyad]] [[Caliphate]]s saw a century of rapid expansion of Arab power well beyond the Arabian peninsula in the form of a vast Muslim Arab Empire with an area of influence that stretched from the northwest [[Indian subcontinent]], across [[Central Asia]], the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], southern [[Italy]], and the [[Iberian Peninsula]], to the [[Pyrenees]].\n\nMuhammad began preaching Islam at [[Mecca]] before [[Hijra (Islam)|migrating]] to [[Medina]], from where he united the [[tribes of Arabia]] into a singular Arab Muslim religious polity. With Muhammad's death in 632 AD, disagreement broke out over who would succeed him as leader of the Muslim community. [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]], a prominent [[sahaba|companion]] of Muhammad, nominated [[Abu Bakr]], who was Muhammad's intimate friend and collaborator. Others added their support and Abu Bakr was made the first [[caliph]]. This choice was disputed by some of Muhammad's companions, who held that [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]], his cousin and son-in-law, had been designated his successor. Abu Bakr's immediate task was to avenge a recent defeat by [[Byzantine]] (or [[Eastern Roman Empire]]) forces, although he first had to put down a rebellion by Arab tribes in an episode known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\".<ref>See:\n* Holt (1977a), p.57\n* Hourani (2003), p.22\n* Lapidus (2002), p.32\n* Madelung (1996), p.43\n* Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref>\n\nFollowing Muhammad's death in 632, [[Abu Bakr]] became leader of the Muslims as the first [[Caliph]]. After putting down a rebellion by the Arab tribes (known as the [[Ridda wars]], or \"Wars of Apostasy\"), Abu Bakr attacked the [[Byzantine Empire]]. On his death in 634, he was succeeded by [[Umar]] as caliph, followed by [[Uthman ibn al-Affan]] and [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]. The period of these first four caliphs is known as ''al-khulaf\u0101' ar-r\u0101shid\u016bn'': the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun or \"rightly guided\" Caliphate]]. Under the Rashidun Caliphs, and, from 661, their [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad successors]], the Arabs rapidly expanded the territory under Muslim control outside of Arabia. In a matter of decades Muslim armies decisively defeated the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine army]] and destroyed the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian Empire]], [[Muslim conquests|conquering huge swathes of territory]] from the [[Iberian peninsula]] to India. The political focus of the Muslim world then shifted to the newly conquered territories.<ref>See: Holt (1977a), p.57, Hourani (2003), p.22, Lapidus (2002), p.32, Madelung (1996), p.43, Tabatabaei (1979), p.30\u201350</ref><ref name=\"L.

Their domain originally comprised only the holy cities of [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] but in the 13th century it was extended to include the rest of the [[Hejaz]]. Although, the Sharifs exercised at most times independent authority in the [[Hejaz]], they were usually subject to the [[suzerainty]] of one of the major Islamic empires of the time.

Another important goal was to improve the economic and political integration of the distant Arabian provinces into the Ottoman state, and to facilitate the transportation of military troops in case of need.\n\nThe [[Hejaz Railway]] was a [[narrow gauge railway]] ({{convert|1050|km|mile|abbr=on}}) that ran from [[Damascus]] to [[Medina]], through the Hejaz region of Arabia. It was originally planned to reach the holy city of [[Mecca]], but due to the interruption of the construction works caused by the outbreak of World War I, it eventually only reached Medina. It was a part of the [[Turkish State Railways#Ottoman railways|Ottoman railway]] network and was built in order to extend the previously existing line between Istanbul and Damascus (which began from the [[Haydarpa\u015fa Terminal]]).\n\nThe railway was started in 1900 at the behest of the Ottoman Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] and was built largely by the [[Turkey|Turk]]s, with [[German Empire|German]] advice and support. A public subscription was opened throughout the Islamic world to fund the construction. The railway was to be a [[waqf]], an inalienable religious endowment or charitable trust.<ref>King Hussein and the Kingdom of Hejaz, Randall Baker, Oleander Press 1979, {{ISBN|0-900891-48-3}}, page 18</ref>\n\n====The Arab Revolt and the foundation of Saudi Arabia====\nThe major developments of the early 20th century were the [[Arab Revolt]] during World War I and the subsequent collapse and [[partitioning of the Ottoman Empire]]. The Arab Revolt (1916\u20131918) was initiated by the [[Sherif Hussein ibn Ali]] with the aim of securing independence from the ruling [[Ottoman Empire]] and creating a single unified Arab state spanning from [[Aleppo]] in [[Syria]] to [[Aden]] in Yemen. During World War I, the Sharif Hussein entered into an alliance with the United Kingdom and France against the Ottomans in June 1916.\n\nThese events were followed by the [[foundation of Saudi Arabia]] under King [[Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia|Abdulaziz Ibn Saud]]. In 1902, Ibn Saud had captured [[Riyadh]]. Continuing his conquests, Abdulaziz subdued Al-Hasa, [[Emirate of Jabal Shammar|Jabal Shammar]], [[Kingdom of Hejaz|Hejaz]] between 1913 and 1926 founded the modern state of [[Saudi Arabia]]. The Saudis absorbed the [[Idrisid Emirate of Asir|Emirate of Asir]], with their expansion only ending in 1934 after a [[Saudi\u2013Yemeni War (1934)|war with Yemen]]. Two Saudi states were formed and controlled much of Arabia before Ibn Saud was even born. Ibn Saud, however, established the third Saudi state.\n\n====Oil reserves====\nThe second major development has been the discovery of vast reserves of oil in the 1930s. Its production brought great wealth to all countries of the region, with the exception of [[Yemen]].\n\n====Civil war in Yemen====\nThe [[North Yemen Civil War]] was fought in [[North Yemen]] between royalists of the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]] and factions of the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] from 1962 to 1970. The war began with a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] carried out by the republican leader, [[Abdullah as-Sallal]], which dethroned the newly crowned [[Muhammad al-Badr]] and declared Yemen a republic under his presidency. The Imam escaped to the [[Saudi Arabia]]n border and rallied popular support.\n\nThe royalist side received support from Saudi Arabia, while the republicans were supported by [[Egypt]] and the Soviet Union. Both foreign irregular and conventional forces were also involved. The [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]], [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], supported the republicans with as many as 70,000 troops. Despite several military moves and peace conferences, the war sank into a stalemate. Egypt's commitment to the war is considered to have been detrimental to its performance in the [[Six-Day War]] of June 1967, after which Nasser found it increasingly difficult to maintain his army's involvement and began to pull his forces out of Yemen.\n\nBy 1970, King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia]] recognized the republic and a truce was signed. Egyptian military historians refer to the war in Yemen as their [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].<ref name=enein>{{Cite news |issue=Jan\u2013Feb, 2004 |last=Aboul-Enein |first=Youssef |title=The Egyptian-Yemen War: Egyptian perspectives on Guerrilla warfare |work=Infantry Magazine |access-date=October 3, 2008 |date=2004-01-01 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203161830/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0IAV/is_1_93/ai_n6123802 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-02-03}}</ref>\n\n====Gulf War====\nIn 1990, [[Iraq]] invaded Kuwait.<ref>see Richard Schofield, Kuwait and Iraq: Historical Claims and Territorial.

Most of these recoveries are mere fragments: a head, arm, torso, or a leg.<ref>Castro-Leal, p. 143 .</ref>  It is thought, based on wooden busts recovered from the water-logged [[El Manati]] site, that figurines were also carved from wood, but, if so, none have survived.\n\nMore durable and better known by the general public are those figurines carved, usually with a degree of skill, from [[jadeite|jade]], [[Serpentine group|serpentine]], [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]], [[basalt]], and other minerals and stones.\n\n==Baby-face figurines==\nThe \"[[wikt:babyface|baby-face]]\" figurine is a unique marker of Olmec culture, consistently found in sites that show Olmec influence,<ref>Scott, p. 268.</ref> although they seem to be confined to the early Olmec period and are largely absent, for example, in [[La Venta]].<ref>Coe (1989), p. 77.</ref>\n\nThese ceramic figurines are easily recognized by the chubby body, the baby-like jowly face, downturned mouth, and the puffy slit-like eyes. The head is slightly pear-shaped, likely due to [[artificial cranial deformation]].<ref>Pohorilenko, p. 121.</ref>  They often wear a tight-fitting helmet not dissimilar to those worn by the [[Olmec colossal heads]].<ref>Pohorilenko, p. 121 .</ref>  Baby-face figurines are usually naked, but without [[genitalia]].<ref>Blomster (1998), p. 311, says \"Sex or gender do not appear to be indicated on any of these objects.\".</ref> Their bodies are rarely rendered with the detail shown on their faces.\n\nAlso called \"hollow babies\", these figurines are generally from {{convert|25|\u2013|35|cm|in|abbr=on}} high<ref>Blomster (2002), p. 173.</ref> and feature a highly [[Burnishing (pottery)|burnish]]ed white- or cream-[[slip (ceramics)|slip]].

While the extent of Olmec control over the areas beyond their heartland is not yet known, [[Mesoamerican culture#Pre-Classic Era|Formative Period]] figurines with Olmec motifs were widespread in the centuries from 1000 to 500 BC, showing a consistency of style and subject throughout nearly all of Mesoamerica.\n\nThese figurines are usually found in household refuse, ancient construction fill, and, outside the Olmec heartland, graves.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pool |first1=Christopher A. |editor1-first=Timothy |editor1-last=Insoll |title=Mesoamerica\u2014Olmec Figurines |journal=The Oxford Handbook of Prehistoric Figurines |date=Apr 2017 |doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199675616.013.012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cheetham |first1=David |title=Early Olmec Figurines from Two Regions: Style as Cultural Imperative |journal=University Press of Florida |date=2009 |url=http://www.famsi.org/reports/05021/pdf3EarlyOlmec.pdf}}</ref> However, many Olmec-style figurines, particularly those labelled as [[Las Bocas]]- or [[Xochipala]]-style, were recovered by looters and are therefore without [[provenance]].\n\nThe vast majority of figurines are simple in design, often nude or with a minimum of clothing, and made of local [[terracotta]]. Most of these recoveries are mere fragments: a head, arm, torso, or a leg.<ref>Castro-Leal, p. 143 .</ref>  It is thought, based on wooden busts recovered from the water-logged [[El Manati]] site, that figurines were also carved from wood, but, if so, none have survived.\n\nMore durable and better known by the general public are those figurines carved, usually with a degree of skill, from [[jadeite|jade]], [[Serpentine group|serpentine]], [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]], [[basalt]], and other minerals and stones.\n\n==Baby-face figurines==\nThe \"[[wikt:babyface|baby-face]]\" figurine is a unique marker of Olmec culture, consistently found in sites that show Olmec influence,<ref>Scott, p. 268.</ref> although they seem to be confined to the early Olmec period and are largely absent, for example, in [[La Venta]].<ref>Coe (1989), p. 77.</ref>\n\nThese ceramic figurines are easily recognized by the chubby body, the baby-like jowly face, downturned mouth, and the puffy slit-like eyes.

As a child, Shaffer took piano lessons, and in his teenage years played the organ in a band called Fabulous Fugitives with his schoolmates in Thunder Bay.

Educated at the [[University of Toronto]], he began playing with [[jazz]] guitarist [[Tisziji Mu\u00f1oz]], performing in bands around the bars there, where he found an interest in musicals, and completed his studies, with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A. degree]] in sociology in 1971.<ref name=\"King\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/paul-shaffer-emc/ |title=Shaffer, Paul|last=King|first=Betty Nygaard |work=Encyclopedia of Music in Canada|publisher=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2009-01-02}}; Michael Posner, \"Paul Talk\", ''Toronto Globe and Mail'', October 17, 2009</ref>\n\nShaffer appears briefly, playing an organ at an outdoor wedding, in ''[[North of Superior]]'' (1971) an early [[IMAX]] documentary shot in [[northern Ontario]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=316904|title=I talked to Paul Shaffer today! - Straight Dope Message Board|website=Boards.straightdope.com|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Musical career==\nShaffer began his music career in 1972 when [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Stephen Schwartz]] invited him to be the musical director for the Toronto production of ''[[Godspell]]'',<ref name=cm>{{cite web|url=http://lakesuperiornews.info/News/PaulShaffer/tabid/249/Default.aspx|title=Paul Shaffer to receive Order of Canada|date=December 28, 2007|accessdate=2008-04-23|work=Lake Superior News|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821193016/http://www.lakesuperiornews.info/News/PaulShaffer/tabid/249/Default.aspx|archivedate=August 21, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> starring [[Victor Garber]], [[Gilda Radner]], [[Martin Short]], [[Eugene Levy]], [[Dave Thomas (actor)|Dave Thomas]] and [[Andrea Martin]]. He went on to play piano for the Schwartz [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show ''[[The Magic Show]]'' in 1974, then became a member of the house band on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') television program from 1975 to 1980 (except for a brief departure in 1977). Though Shaffer was at the piano and appeared to be directing the band's actions, [[Howard Shore]] was credited as ''SNL'''s musical director, eventually turning the actual conducting of the band to [[Howard Johnson (jazz musician)|Howard Johnson]]. Shaffer also regularly appeared in the show's sketches, notably as the pianist for [[Bill Murray]]'s Nick the Lounge Singer character, and as [[Don Kirshner]].<ref name=nytimes2019-12-14/> He also appeared as a keyboardist on the 1978 album, ''[[Desire Wire]]'', recorded by pop/rock star, musician and backing vocalist [[Cindy Bullens]].\n\nShaffer occasionally teamed up with the [[Not Ready for Prime-Time Players]] off the show as well, including work on Gilda Radner's highly successful Broadway show and as the musical director for [[John Belushi]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]] whenever they recorded or performed as [[The Blues Brothers]]. Shaffer was to appear in the duo's 1980 film, but, as he revealed in October 2009 on ''[[CBS Sunday Morning]]'', Belushi dropped him from the project. In a memo to fellow ''SNL'' colleagues, Belushi said that he was unhappy that Shaffer was spending so much time on a studio record for Radner. Belushi said that he had tried to talk Shaffer out of working on the album in the first place in order to avoid sharing Shaffer's talents with another ''SNL''-related project.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/paul-shaffers-showbiz-journey/|title=Paul Shaffer's Showbiz Journey|website=www.cbsnews.com}}</ref> Shaffer later reported that he was in (unrequited) love with [[Gilda Radner]].<ref>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Posner|title=Paul Talk|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=October 17, 2009}}</ref> He would go on to appear in 1998's ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]''.\n\nBeginning in 1982, Shaffer served as musical director for [[David Letterman]]'s late night talk shows: as leader of \"The World's Most Dangerous Band\" for ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' (1982\u20131993) on NBC, for which he also composed the theme song, and as leader of the [[CBS Orchestra]] for the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' (1993\u20132015) on [[CBS]]. Letterman consistently maintained that the show's switch to CBS was because NBC \"fired Paul for stealing pens\" or some other trivial reason. Shaffer guest-hosted the show four times when Letterman was unavailable: February 9 and 11, 2000, during Letterman's recovery from his quintuple [[heart bypass surgery]]; March 24, 2003, when Letterman was suffering from [[shingles]]; and January 19, 2005, when Letterman went to receive an award for his [[Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing|racing team]]'s victory in the [[2004 Indianapolis 500]].\n\nIn 1984, Shaffer played keyboards for [[The Honeydrippers]], a group formed in 1981 by former [[Led Zeppelin]] frontman [[Robert Plant]], on their only studio album, ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume One]]''. The album included the hit single \"[[Sea of Love (song)|Sea of Love]]\" which reached No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s adult contemporary chart in 1984 and No. 3 on its Hot 100 chart in 1985.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0000650260|label=The Honeydrippers, Vol. 1|tab=credits}}</ref>\n\nShaffer has served as musical director and producer for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction ceremony since its inception in 1986 and filled the same role for the [[1996 Olympic Games]] closing ceremonies from Atlanta, Georgia. Shaffer also served as musical director for ''[[Fats Domino]] and Friends'', a Cinemax special that included [[Ray Charles]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Ron Wood]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theworldsmostdangerousband.com/bio_paul.html|title=Paul Shaffer and the World's Most Dangerous Band-Biography|website=Theworldsmostdangerousband.com|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref>\n\nShaffer has hosted [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] Induction Concert and Ceremonies. \n\nHe released two solo albums, 1989's ''Coast to Coast'', and 1993's ''[[The World's Most Dangerous Party]]'', produced by rock musician [[Todd Rundgren]]. Shaffer has also recorded with a wide range of artists, including [[Donald Fagen]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Grand Funk Railroad]], [[Diana Ross]], [[B.B. King]], [[Asleep at the Wheel]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Carl Perkins]], [[Yoko Ono]], [[Blues Traveler]], [[Jeff Healey]], [[Cher]], [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]], [[Luba (singer)|Luba]], [[Robert Burns]], [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Nina Hagen]], [[Robert Plant]], [[Peter Criss]], [[Scandal (American band)|Scandal]], [[Brian Wilson]], ''Late Show'' regular [[Warren Zevon]], jazz trumpeter [[Lew Soloff]], jazz saxophonist [[Lou Marini]] and bluegrass legend [[Earl Scruggs]]. In 1982, he co-wrote \"[[It's Raining Men]],\" with [[Paul Jabara]].

Soon after, Shaffer began to receive cuts of episodes from the first season and he started to put music in afterwards where the director thought it was needed. In developing the sound of the show's music, Shaffer initially looked to Letterman for guidance. Finding none, he remembered his and Letterman's shared love for the sort of music produced at the [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] in [[Sheffield, Alabama]], describing it as \"the honesty you hear, the southern soul feeling\". The score initially included drums but the show's producers and director thought that the music should \"feel like it's Dave's old friend Paul playing\", so it was ultimately stripped down to solely include piano and organ.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leight|first1=Elias|title=Paul Shaffer on Writing Letterman's Netflix Theme Song & the Value of Humor in Pop|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8097779/paul-shaffer-letterman-netflix-interview|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=February 9, 2018|date=February 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nShaffer competed on the second season of the TV series ''[[The Masked Singer (American TV series)|The Masked Singer]]'' as The Skeleton.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lynette Rice|title=The Masked Singer Skeleton admits he got a call from David Letterman weeks ago|url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/10/16/the-masked-singer-skeleton-paul-shaffer-interview/|date=October 16, 2019|accessdate=October 16, 2019|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>\n\n==Other activities==\nShaffer has appeared in a number of motion pictures over the years, including a small role (Artie Fufkin of Polymer Records) in [[Rob Reiner]]'s ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]],'' ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', a scene with [[Miles Davis]] in the [[Bill Murray]] film ''[[Scrooged]]'', and as a passenger in [[John Travolta]]'s [[taxicab]] in ''[[Look Who's Talking Too]]''.

It not only escaped the censors in the live broadcast and the West Coast taped airing, but also reappeared in the summer rerun, and even in the syndicated versions of the show for several years.

Letterman consistently maintained that the show's switch to CBS was because NBC \"fired Paul for stealing pens\" or some other trivial reason. Shaffer guest-hosted the show four times when Letterman was unavailable: February 9 and 11, 2000, during Letterman's recovery from his quintuple [[heart bypass surgery]]; March 24, 2003, when Letterman was suffering from [[shingles]]; and January 19, 2005, when Letterman went to receive an award for his [[Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing|racing team]]'s victory in the [[2004 Indianapolis 500]].\n\nIn 1984, Shaffer played keyboards for [[The Honeydrippers]], a group formed in 1981 by former [[Led Zeppelin]] frontman [[Robert Plant]], on their only studio album, ''[[The Honeydrippers: Volume One]]''. The album included the hit single \"[[Sea of Love (song)|Sea of Love]]\" which reached No. 1 on ''Billboard'''s adult contemporary chart in 1984 and No. 3 on its Hot 100 chart in 1985.<ref>{{Allmusic|class=album|id=mw0000650260|label=The Honeydrippers, Vol. 1|tab=credits}}</ref>\n\nShaffer has served as musical director and producer for the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] induction ceremony since its inception in 1986 and filled the same role for the [[1996 Olympic Games]] closing ceremonies from Atlanta, Georgia. Shaffer also served as musical director for ''[[Fats Domino]] and Friends'', a Cinemax special that included [[Ray Charles]], [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] and [[Ron Wood]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theworldsmostdangerousband.com/bio_paul.html|title=Paul Shaffer and the World's Most Dangerous Band-Biography|website=Theworldsmostdangerousband.com|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref>\n\nShaffer has hosted [[Musicians Hall of Fame and Museum]] Induction Concert and Ceremonies. \n\nHe released two solo albums, 1989's ''Coast to Coast'', and 1993's ''[[The World's Most Dangerous Party]]'', produced by rock musician [[Todd Rundgren]]. Shaffer has also recorded with a wide range of artists, including [[Donald Fagen]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Grand Funk Railroad]], [[Diana Ross]], [[B.B.

In 1982, he co-wrote \"[[It's Raining Men]],\" with [[Paul Jabara]]. It was No. 1 on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play charts, a No. 2 hit in the UK for [[The Weather Girls]] in 1984 and a UK No. 1 remake for [[Geri Halliwell]] in 2001. Shaffer and The World's Most Dangerous Band performed the [[Chuck Berry]] song \"Roll over Beethoven\" for the 1992 film [[Beethoven (film)|''Beethoven'']].\n\nIn 2017, Shaffer reunited with his band, resuming its previous name, and recorded the self-titled album ''Paul Shaffer & the World's Most Dangerous Band''. Shaffer and the band released their album in March and then went on tour as well as making appearances on both ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live]]'' and ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'', for which Shaffer and the band returned to the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]] for the first time since Letterman's finale two years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/arts/music/paul-shaffer-david-letterman-bill-murray-album.html?nytmobile=0|title=Paul Shaffer Shakes Off His Post-''Letterman'' Blues|work=The New York Times|first=Dave|last=Itzkoff}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://media.rhino.com/press-release/paul-shaffer-worlds-most-dangerous-band-new-album-available-march-17|title=Paul Shaffer & The World's Most Dangerous Band New Album Available March 17 &#124; Rhino Media|website=media.rhino.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/news/watch-paul-shaffers-uproarious-return-to-late-night-w488761|title=Watch Paul Shaffer's Uproarious Return to 'Late Night'|first=Jon|last=Blistein|date=June 20, 2017|website=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1930246/paul-shaffer-perform-with-jenny-lewis-and-shaggy-on-kimmel/video/|title=Watch Paul Shaffer Perform With Jenny Lewis And Shaggy On Kimmel|date=March 16, 2017|website=Stereogum.com|accessdate=August 15, 2018}}</ref>\n\nShaffer wrote and performs the theme song and bridging music on Letterman's current [[Netflix]] series ''[[My Next Guest Needs No Introduction with David Letterman]]'' which premiered in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stuever|first1=Hank|title=Review: Letterman sits down with Obama, but both men seem rusty and off their game|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/letterman-sits-down-with-obama-but-both-men-seem-rusty-and-off-their-game/2018/01/11/2b6dc8c0-f70c-11e7-a9e3-ab18ce41436a_story.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=January 13, 2018|date=January 12, 2018}}</ref> After it was announced publicly that Netflix had given the series an order, Shaffer received a phone call from Letterman asking him to work on the show. Soon after, Shaffer began to receive cuts of episodes from the first season and he started to put music in afterwards where the director thought it was needed. In developing the sound of the show's music, Shaffer initially looked to Letterman for guidance. Finding none, he remembered his and Letterman's shared love for the sort of music produced at the [[Muscle Shoals Sound Studio]] in [[Sheffield, Alabama]], describing it as \"the honesty you hear, the southern soul feeling\". The score initially included drums but the show's producers and director thought that the music should \"feel like it's Dave's old friend Paul playing\", so it was ultimately stripped down to solely include piano and organ.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Leight|first1=Elias|title=Paul Shaffer on Writing Letterman's Netflix Theme Song & the Value of Humor in Pop|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8097779/paul-shaffer-letterman-netflix-interview|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=February 9, 2018|date=February 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nShaffer competed on the second season of the TV series ''[[The Masked Singer (American TV series)|The Masked Singer]]'' as The Skeleton.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lynette Rice|title=The Masked Singer Skeleton admits he got a call from David Letterman weeks ago|url=https://ew.com/tv/2019/10/16/the-masked-singer-skeleton-paul-shaffer-interview/|date=October 16, 2019|accessdate=October 16, 2019|publisher=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>\n\n==Other activities==\nShaffer has appeared in a number of motion pictures over the years, including a small role (Artie Fufkin of Polymer Records) in [[Rob Reiner]]'s ''[[This Is Spinal Tap]],'' ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', a scene with [[Miles Davis]] in the [[Bill Murray]] film ''[[Scrooged]]'', and as a passenger in [[John Travolta]]'s [[taxicab]] in ''[[Look Who's Talking Too]]''.

Though the series only lasted a few episodes, a soundtrack album was released.\n\nFollowing the series' cancellation, Shaffer returned to ''SNL''.

In the middle of a long tirade which featured repeated use of the word \"flogging,\" Shaffer inadvertently uttered the forbidden word. It not only escaped the censors in the live broadcast and the West Coast taped airing, but also reappeared in the summer rerun, and even in the syndicated versions of the show for several years.

He faced a military trial and a possible execution sentence by [[garrote]], but was instead sentenced to twenty years in prison.

He faced a military trial and a possible execution sentence by [[garrote]], but was instead sentenced to twenty years in prison.

They have since appeared in subsequent ''[[Super Mario (series)|Super Mario]]'' games, [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''Mario'' titles and the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series.\n\n===Rosalina===\n{{Main|Rosalina (Mario)}}\n{{Nihongo foot|'''Rosalina'''|\u30ed\u30bc\u30c3\u30bf|Rosetta|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a princess from an unknown location who is the adoptive mother of the Lumas.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2009/06/super-mario-galaxy-2/|title=Miyamoto: Why I Spiked Mario Galaxy 2's Story|last=Kohler|first=Chris|date=2009-06-12|work=Wired|access-date=2019-12-10|issn=1059-1028|quote=\"a princess from outer space and her family of talking stars\"}}</ref> She resides in the Comet Observatory and also the watcher of the cosmos.

He is [[Yoshi]]'s [[archenemy]] and one of the two [[main antagonist]]s of the [[List of Yoshi video games|''Yoshi'' series]], alongside Baby Bowser. He can perform various feats of magic, such as self-duplication, [[teleportation]], shooting magical blasts, and changing the size of other creatures. In Japan, the character shares his name with his species, '''Kamek''' (which are known outside Japan as Magikoopas), which can lead to confusion surrounding his appearances. This will sometimes lead to a literal translation, as in ''Super Princess Peach'' where a boss is described as \"A Kamek made huge by magic.\" Some Japanese sources such as the guide for ''Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island'' call him \"Fang\" to distinguish him from regular Magikoopas.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Baby Luma/Lumas===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Baby Luma'''|\u30d9\u30d3\u30a3\u30c1\u30b3|Bebi Chiko|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is Mario's main companion in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its sequel ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]''. He is among a group of star-shaped beings known as Lumas, who appear in both games.\n\nIn ''Super Mario Galaxy'' Baby Luma first finds Mario sleeping in the planet that houses the ''Gateway to the Starry Sky'' after he has been blasted out of the ''Mushroom World'', and joins him at the request of [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina]], aiding him in his quest to rescue [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] by allowing him to use the \"Spin\" move, which he can use to break crystals, attack enemies and further his jumps, among other things. In the ending of the game, Baby Luma sacrifices his life along his brethren to save the universe from a [[black hole]].\n\nIn ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'', Baby Luma is found by Mario while he was on his way to Princess Peach's Castle and they join forces to rescue the town from a new attack by Bowser, only to be sent out in a new adventure. In this game Baby Luma often receives messages from Rosalina, who remains anonymous for most of the game. He is also called Young Master Luma by other Lumas.\n\n===Cappy===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Cappy'''|\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc|Kyapp\u012b|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the secondary protagonist in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''. Cappy is a Bonneter who meets Mario in the Cap Kingdom, when he pleas for Mario to assist him in rescuing his little sister Tiara. Cappy has the ability to possess enemies and other creatures, allowing Mario to take control of them for periods of time.\n\nCappy appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as [[Mario]]'s side taunt and a Spirit. He quickly throws Cappy and returns it to his head similar to in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.\n\n===Captain Toad===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Captain Toad'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u30d4\u30aa\u968a\u9577|Kinopio Taich\u014d|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an explorer and the leader of the Toad Brigade.

When he appears in ''Super Mario Galaxy'', he is seen building the Starshroom in the Comet Observatory progressively throughout the game. He also makes an appearance as a non-playable character in ''Super Mario Odyssey'' lost in each kingdom.<ref>https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-switch Retrieved July 19, 2018</ref>\n\n===Dorrie===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Dorrie'''|\u30c9\u30c3\u30b7\u30fc|Dossh\u012b|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a large, friendly swimming blue [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaur]]-like character who debuted in ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. He helps Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Yoshi ride across water or reach higher areas. ''Super Mario Odyssey'' explicitly refers to Dorries as a species and it features two additional Dorries, one violet, and one yellow. In terms of design, Dorrie has a few elements in common with Yoshis, such as the white area of soft tissue spanning the whole lower part of the body and a similar round face that, since ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'', even features a placement of the eyes and nostrils akin to that seen in Yoshis.\n\nDorrie returns in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and appears in two sizes. Mario can ride on his back to cross large bodies of poison in World 4-1 and World 4-6. If Mario does a Ground Pound on Dorrie, he moves faster through the water.\n\n===Honey Queen===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Honey Queen'''|\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u30a4\u30fc\u30f3|Han\u012b Ku\u012bn|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the queen of all the [[Honey bee|Honeybees]].

U]]'', where he steals items from Toad Houses and the Mario Bros. have to chase him through various levels to capture him and get them back. He's the main source of P-Acorn powerups, making it worth the player's time to catch him. In ''New Super Luigi U'', he's promoted to Playable as the fourth character available for multiplayer. He returned to ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe]]'' as a fifth playable character along with Toadette, Luigi, Toad and Mario.\n\nHe is a purple rabbit with round eyes, long ears, and black limbs. He also wears a white handkerchief with a drawing of a large mouth with sharpened teeth, similar to Bowser Jr.'s mask (though despite this he does not work for Bowser), as well as orange shoes and white gloves.\n\nNabbit also appeared as a stage hazard in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros.

The name Pauline was first given to the character in the ''Donkey Kong'' animated segments shown in the television series ''[[Saturday Supercade]]'' voiced by [[Judy Strangis]].

While the original Pauline was portrayed as a [[blond]]e in a pink gown, this new version of the character was a [[Brown hair|brunette]] who wears a red dress.<ref name=\"ignpauline\" /> Because of her different design, the Pauline in the Game Boy version of ''Donkey Kong'' was initially considered in certain Mario media a separate character from the original incarnation of the character (who was still known as Lady) featured in the arcade and Famicom versions, with the two versions of the character being given separate profiles in Shogakukan's 1994 ''Mario Character Encyclopedia'' book.<ref name=lady_and_pauline>{{cite book|title=\u30d1\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u7248 \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u5927\u4e8b\u5178|trans-title=Mario Character Encyclopedia: Perfect Edition|publisher=Shogakukan|date=November 20, 1994|page=24|isbn=4092590679|url=http://i.imgur.com/3OabVR8.jpg}}</ref> However, later games and sources (most notably the Japanese version of ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS]]'') acknowledge that Pauline and Lady are meant to be the same character.<ref name=pauline_trophy_jp>{{cite video game|title=\u5927\u4e71\u95d8\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30d6\u30e9\u30b6\u30fc\u30ba for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U|trans-title=Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U|language=Japanese|quote=\u540d\u524d\u304c\u30ec\u30c7\u30a3? \u30dd\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3058\u3083\u306a\u304f\u3066? \u306f\u3044\u3001\u30dd\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3068\u3044\u3046\u540d\u306f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u7248\u304b\u3089|trans-quote=Is her name Lady? or is it, Pauline?

In the game, it allows the playable characters to ride him through certain levels. Plessie's name is a portmanteau of \"[[Plesiosaurus]]\" and \"Nessie.\" The former is an extinct group of large marine reptiles that are often confused as dinosaurs, whereas the latter is the nickname given to the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. Its design share some features with the design of Yoshis, such as the bipedal posture with short legs, the white soft tissue that spans the lower part of the body, big oval eyes pointing forward which feature a white sclera, the nostrils being hosted near the top of a round protruding end of the upper part of the muzzle, and a crest on the back of the head, although the shape of the latter is different.\n\nPlessie appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a support spirit.\n\n===Poochy===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Poochy'''|\u30dd\u30c1|Pochi|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is [[Yoshi]]'s pet [[dog]]. Poochy doesn't have any ears or a nose, and he has big lips that look like a [[Duck|duck's]] bill, making him look more like a [[platypus]] than a dog. Poochy is a good swimmer and can sniff out hidden items for Yoshi. Poochy can also do things that Yoshi can't, such as crossing over dangerous terrain, and jumping over walls to give Yoshi a boost out of his wall jumps. Poochy's first appearance was in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''.\n\n===Professor E. Gadd===\n'''Professor Elvin Gadd''' ({{nihongo foot|'''Professor Oya M\u0101'''|\u30aa\u30e4\u30fb\u30de\u30fc\u535a\u58eb|Oya M\u0101 Hakase|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan), more commonly known as '''E. Gadd''', is a [[scientist]] who, with his various inventions, helps Luigi save his brother Mario and  the mansion. His name is a pun on the Japanese interjection '''{{nihongo foot|''Oyam\u0101!''|\u304a\u3084\u307e\u3042\uff01|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}''', meaning \"Good heavens!\" His name is also inspired by [[Nintendo]] [[game designer]] Yoshiyuki Oyama.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Inside Zelda |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |date=March 2006 |volume=201 |pages=&nbsp;46\u201348}}</ref> The English translations accordingly adapted the name to a pun on the expression \"egad\"! His first appearance was in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for [[Nintendo GameCube]], in which he investigates a haunted mansion that mysteriously appeared by his laboratory. To help him study the ghosts in the mansion, he uses the \"Poltergust 3000\", a high-powered vacuum cleaner that can suck in and capture ghosts, and the \"[[Game Boy Color|Game Boy Horror]]\", an invention for tracking and detecting objects such as Boos. He lends it to Luigi and helps him on his quest. His voice is played by [[Kazumi Totaka]], who also voiced [[Yoshi]].\n\nGadd reprises his supporting role in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' in a remodeled lab to assist Luigi again with his \"Poltergust 5000\" and a \"[[Nintendo DS|Dual Scream]]\", which replaces the Game Boy Horror. The Nintendo 3DS remake of the original ''Luigi\u2019s Mansion'' introduces a new invention: a lime-green doppelg\u00e4nger of Luigi, called \"Gooigi\", which can be brought along as a partner in local co-op play.\n\nIn the third installment, ''[[Luigi's Mansion 3]]'', Gooigi returns and E. Gadd provides Luigi with a new Poltergust model, the \"Poltergust G-00\". Luigi rescues him at the time when his friends were captured by Hellen Gravely at a hotel called The Last Resort.\n\nHe is mentioned in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' but not seen, but his inventions: a '''Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device''' or \"'''F.L.U.D.D.'''\" and Magic Brush were used by Mario and [[Bowser Jr.]] respectively. E. Gadd also creates a Time Machine in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' and various inventions as rewards for making bean coffees at the Starbeans Cafe in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and its [[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions|3DS remake]]. In ''[[Mario Party 6]]'', E. Gadd is featured on a party board called E. Gadd's Garage.\n\n''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' features E. Gadd as an unlockable ''Mystery Mushroom'' costume, made available through an update.\n\n===Sprixie Princesses===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Sprixie Princesses'''|\u3088\u3046\u305b\u3044\u59eb|Y\u014dseihime|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are the rulers of the Sprixie Kingdom and the Sprixies, a race of [[Fairy|fairies]]. They appear in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. The green Sprixie Princess is the sole Sprixie Princess and refers to the others as her followers. The green Sprixie Princess first appears when Mario and Luigi find and repair a Clear Pipe. The pipe promptly ejects a large number of items before the princess emerges. The green Sprixie Princess tells the group that the Sprixie Kingdom is in danger, as Bowser had managed to capture the other six princesses and that she had only narrowly escaped his grasp. Moments after she emerges, however, Bowser comes up through the same pipe, leaving her dazed, captures the green Sprixie Princess in a bottle, and retreats down the pipe. The group quickly follows after Bowser in order to rescue the kingdom, and they soon find that each Sprixie Princess is guarded in one of the first seven worlds' castles. Defeating the boss of the castle will reveal a Warp Box that takes the group to a room containing both the Goal Pole and the imprisoned Sprixie.\n\nEach time a Sprixie Princess is saved, she will build a Clear Pipe to the next world with either a hammer or a wrench (with the exception of the red Sprixie Princess, since she was recaptured after she was saved in World Castle (World 7) and she only helped build a rocket ship). It is possible for the player to skip saving the first and fourth Sprixie Princesses if they take the secret exits found in World 1 and World 4, respectively, although as a result they will be entirely absent during the ending and when Bowser recaptures them.\n\nThe group eventually manages to rescue the last of the seven Sprixie Princesses after defeating Bowser in his car for the second time in World Castle (World 7), seemingly the last stage of the game. However, Bowser promptly reappears, stuffs all seven princesses into a larger bottle, and flees to World Bowser (World 8), a Bowser-themed carnival area that serves as the true final world of the main game. Here, Bowser confronts the heroes after transforming into Meowser and is defeated, dropping the Sprixie Princesses in the process. The princesses then use their powers to undo all the harm done to their land before waving goodbye to the heroes as they return to the Mushroom Kingdom via a Clear Pipe.\n\nAfter the ending credits, the Sprixie Princesses build a rocket ship in World 1 for the player to use in order to travel to the secret bonus worlds in outer space (Star, Mushroom, Flower, and Crown).\n\nThe green Sprixie Princess is also playable in ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash]]''.\n\n===Tiara===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Tiara'''|\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30e9|Tiara|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the secondary damsel in distress in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.

They are led by Captain Toad. Later the group would expand to include Toadette, bringing the membership up to six. The members consist of Captain Toad, Toadette, Hint Toad (blue), Yellow Toad, Banktoad (green), and Mailtoad (magenta).\n\n===Toadsworth===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Toadsworth'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u3058\u3044|Kinojii|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an elderly Toad and Princess Peach's longtime [[Steward (office)|steward]], first appearing in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', when he comes along with Princess Peach and Mario to Isle Delfino. He makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' at the beginning (where he presents Mario and Luigi with a suitcase) and end of the game.\n\nPaper Toadsworth accompanies Paper Princess Peach on her trip to Rogueport during ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', keeping Paper Peach very close to him, but ends up losing her.\n\nIn ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'', he is with Mario and Luigi when Princess Peach takes an experimental trip back in time. He is also included in ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'' where he gives Peach a parasol named Perry in the cinema and is seen as a lead guitarist of the band called Peach Hit Five in the music room.\n\nHe also appears in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]'' and its 3DS remake where he was inhaled by Bowser. In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', Toadsworth appeared as the gang went on a vacation in Pi'illo Island.\n\nToadsworth makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' when the player wins a cup. He acts as an umpire in ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the [[GameCube]] as well as in the [[remake]] for the [[Wii]], in which Toadsworth reprimands the player when a foul shot is made. In ''[[Mario Party 7]]'', he is a host of the boards.

Boom Boom returned in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' 23 years after their last appearance. He resides in various airships where he encounters Mario. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros.

When Captain Toad is chasing Wingo who kidnapped Toadette, he accidentally comes across Pyropuff Peak. Draggadon attacks him, thinking him to be an intruder, but after the fight realizes that he was innocent, and allows him to ride on his head as the two conquer hordes of enemies. Toadette in her pursuit of Wingo also ends up at Pyropuff Peak, which results in the same situation playing. Once again, Toadette befriends him, and they conquer even more enemies.\n\nUnlike Wingo, Draggadon is not battled directly. Captain Toad and Toadette must avoid his attacks to the end of the level by hiding behind walls, and at the end, knock a pillar on his head. He is then knocked unconscious, and the Toads collect the Power Star. Another Draggadon, named Gold Draggadon, also appears in a later episode, as the king of the Golden Realm.

She first appeared in ''[[Paper Mario]]'' for the Nintendo 64, helping Bowser by leaving enemies in Mario's way, transporting Bowser into the Star Spirit Sanctuary, and augmenting his size and power in the final battle. After being defeated by the Star Kid, Twink, she continued to work for him. In ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', she acted as Bowser's second-in-command. Generally, her position is very similar with Kamek who appeared earlier than her, which possibly means why she is replaced by him in ''[[Paper Mario: Sticker Star]]''. [[IGN]] rated her as one of the weirdest ''Mario'' characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.wii.ign.com/articles/119/1199242p3.html|title=Weirdest Mario Characters|first=Audrey|last=Drake|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n\n===King Bob-omb===\n{{nihongo foot|'''King Bob-omb'''|\u30dc\u30e0\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0|Bomu Kingu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the king of the Bob-ombs.

He can perform various feats of magic, such as self-duplication, [[teleportation]], shooting magical blasts, and changing the size of other creatures. In Japan, the character shares his name with his species, '''Kamek''' (which are known outside Japan as Magikoopas), which can lead to confusion surrounding his appearances. This will sometimes lead to a literal translation, as in ''Super Princess Peach'' where a boss is described as \"A Kamek made huge by magic.\" Some Japanese sources such as the guide for ''Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island'' call him \"Fang\" to distinguish him from regular Magikoopas.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Baby Luma/Lumas===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Baby Luma'''|\u30d9\u30d3\u30a3\u30c1\u30b3|Bebi Chiko|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is Mario's main companion in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its sequel ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]''.

He helps Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Yoshi ride across water or reach higher areas. ''Super Mario Odyssey'' explicitly refers to Dorries as a species and it features two additional Dorries, one violet, and one yellow. In terms of design, Dorrie has a few elements in common with Yoshis, such as the white area of soft tissue spanning the whole lower part of the body and a similar round face that, since ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'', even features a placement of the eyes and nostrils akin to that seen in Yoshis.\n\nDorrie returns in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and appears in two sizes.

He returned to ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe]]'' as a fifth playable character along with Toadette, Luigi, Toad and Mario.\n\nHe is a purple rabbit with round eyes, long ears, and black limbs.

In the game, it allows the playable characters to ride him through certain levels. Plessie's name is a portmanteau of \"[[Plesiosaurus]]\" and \"Nessie.\" The former is an extinct group of large marine reptiles that are often confused as dinosaurs, whereas the latter is the nickname given to the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. Its design share some features with the design of Yoshis, such as the bipedal posture with short legs, the white soft tissue that spans the lower part of the body, big oval eyes pointing forward which feature a white sclera, the nostrils being hosted near the top of a round protruding end of the upper part of the muzzle, and a crest on the back of the head, although the shape of the latter is different.\n\nPlessie appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a support spirit.\n\n===Poochy===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Poochy'''|\u30dd\u30c1|Pochi|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is [[Yoshi]]'s pet [[dog]]. Poochy doesn't have any ears or a nose, and he has big lips that look like a [[Duck|duck's]] bill, making him look more like a [[platypus]] than a dog. Poochy is a good swimmer and can sniff out hidden items for Yoshi. Poochy can also do things that Yoshi can't, such as crossing over dangerous terrain, and jumping over walls to give Yoshi a boost out of his wall jumps. Poochy's first appearance was in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''.\n\n===Professor E. Gadd===\n'''Professor Elvin Gadd''' ({{nihongo foot|'''Professor Oya M\u0101'''|\u30aa\u30e4\u30fb\u30de\u30fc\u535a\u58eb|Oya M\u0101 Hakase|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan), more commonly known as '''E. Gadd''', is a [[scientist]] who, with his various inventions, helps Luigi save his brother Mario and  the mansion. His name is a pun on the Japanese interjection '''{{nihongo foot|''Oyam\u0101!''|\u304a\u3084\u307e\u3042\uff01|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}''', meaning \"Good heavens!\" His name is also inspired by [[Nintendo]] [[game designer]] Yoshiyuki Oyama.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Inside Zelda |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |date=March 2006 |volume=201 |pages=&nbsp;46\u201348}}</ref> The English translations accordingly adapted the name to a pun on the expression \"egad\"! His first appearance was in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for [[Nintendo GameCube]], in which he investigates a haunted mansion that mysteriously appeared by his laboratory. To help him study the ghosts in the mansion, he uses the \"Poltergust 3000\", a high-powered vacuum cleaner that can suck in and capture ghosts, and the \"[[Game Boy Color|Game Boy Horror]]\", an invention for tracking and detecting objects such as Boos. He lends it to Luigi and helps him on his quest. His voice is played by [[Kazumi Totaka]], who also voiced [[Yoshi]].\n\nGadd reprises his supporting role in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' in a remodeled lab to assist Luigi again with his \"Poltergust 5000\" and a \"[[Nintendo DS|Dual Scream]]\", which replaces the Game Boy Horror. The Nintendo 3DS remake of the original ''Luigi\u2019s Mansion'' introduces a new invention: a lime-green doppelg\u00e4nger of Luigi, called \"Gooigi\", which can be brought along as a partner in local co-op play.\n\nIn the third installment, ''[[Luigi's Mansion 3]]'', Gooigi returns and E. Gadd provides Luigi with a new Poltergust model, the \"Poltergust G-00\". Luigi rescues him at the time when his friends were captured by Hellen Gravely at a hotel called The Last Resort.\n\nHe is mentioned in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' but not seen, but his inventions: a '''Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device''' or \"'''F.L.U.D.D.'''\" and Magic Brush were used by Mario and [[Bowser Jr.]] respectively. E. Gadd also creates a Time Machine in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' and various inventions as rewards for making bean coffees at the Starbeans Cafe in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and its [[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions|3DS remake]]. In ''[[Mario Party 6]]'', E. Gadd is featured on a party board called E. Gadd's Garage.\n\n''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' features E. Gadd as an unlockable ''Mystery Mushroom'' costume, made available through an update.\n\n===Sprixie Princesses===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Sprixie Princesses'''|\u3088\u3046\u305b\u3044\u59eb|Y\u014dseihime|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are the rulers of the Sprixie Kingdom and the Sprixies, a race of [[Fairy|fairies]]. They appear in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. The green Sprixie Princess is the sole Sprixie Princess and refers to the others as her followers. The green Sprixie Princess first appears when Mario and Luigi find and repair a Clear Pipe. The pipe promptly ejects a large number of items before the princess emerges. The green Sprixie Princess tells the group that the Sprixie Kingdom is in danger, as Bowser had managed to capture the other six princesses and that she had only narrowly escaped his grasp. Moments after she emerges, however, Bowser comes up through the same pipe, leaving her dazed, captures the green Sprixie Princess in a bottle, and retreats down the pipe. The group quickly follows after Bowser in order to rescue the kingdom, and they soon find that each Sprixie Princess is guarded in one of the first seven worlds' castles. Defeating the boss of the castle will reveal a Warp Box that takes the group to a room containing both the Goal Pole and the imprisoned Sprixie.\n\nEach time a Sprixie Princess is saved, she will build a Clear Pipe to the next world with either a hammer or a wrench (with the exception of the red Sprixie Princess, since she was recaptured after she was saved in World Castle (World 7) and she only helped build a rocket ship). It is possible for the player to skip saving the first and fourth Sprixie Princesses if they take the secret exits found in World 1 and World 4, respectively, although as a result they will be entirely absent during the ending and when Bowser recaptures them.\n\nThe group eventually manages to rescue the last of the seven Sprixie Princesses after defeating Bowser in his car for the second time in World Castle (World 7), seemingly the last stage of the game. However, Bowser promptly reappears, stuffs all seven princesses into a larger bottle, and flees to World Bowser (World 8), a Bowser-themed carnival area that serves as the true final world of the main game. Here, Bowser confronts the heroes after transforming into Meowser and is defeated, dropping the Sprixie Princesses in the process. The princesses then use their powers to undo all the harm done to their land before waving goodbye to the heroes as they return to the Mushroom Kingdom via a Clear Pipe.\n\nAfter the ending credits, the Sprixie Princesses build a rocket ship in World 1 for the player to use in order to travel to the secret bonus worlds in outer space (Star, Mushroom, Flower, and Crown).\n\nThe green Sprixie Princess is also playable in ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash]]''.\n\n===Tiara===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Tiara'''|\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30e9|Tiara|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the secondary damsel in distress in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''. She is the sister of Cappy, who is kidnapped by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] as a gift to [[Princess Peach]] to wear on their wedding day.\n\n===Toad Brigade===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Toad Brigade'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u30d4\u30aa\u63a2\u691c\u968a|Kinopio Tankentai|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a group of five Toads that aid Mario through some games, starting with ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''. They are led by Captain Toad. Later the group would expand to include Toadette, bringing the membership up to six. The members consist of Captain Toad, Toadette, Hint Toad (blue), Yellow Toad, Banktoad (green), and Mailtoad (magenta).\n\n===Toadsworth===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Toadsworth'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u3058\u3044|Kinojii|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an elderly Toad and Princess Peach's longtime [[Steward (office)|steward]], first appearing in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', when he comes along with Princess Peach and Mario to Isle Delfino. He makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' at the beginning (where he presents Mario and Luigi with a suitcase) and end of the game.\n\nPaper Toadsworth accompanies Paper Princess Peach on her trip to Rogueport during ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', keeping Paper Peach very close to him, but ends up losing her.\n\nIn ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'', he is with Mario and Luigi when Princess Peach takes an experimental trip back in time. He is also included in ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'' where he gives Peach a parasol named Perry in the cinema and is seen as a lead guitarist of the band called Peach Hit Five in the music room.\n\nHe also appears in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]'' and its 3DS remake where he was inhaled by Bowser. In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', Toadsworth appeared as the gang went on a vacation in Pi'illo Island.\n\nToadsworth makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' when the player wins a cup. He acts as an umpire in ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the [[GameCube]] as well as in the [[remake]] for the [[Wii]], in which Toadsworth reprimands the player when a foul shot is made. In ''[[Mario Party 7]]'', he is a host of the boards. He finally becomes playable in both ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'' and ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]''.\n\nToadsworth is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], [[Wario]] and [[Waluigi]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fenech |first=Stephen |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/meet-the-voice-of-super-mario-charles-martinet/story-e6frewyr-1225772856617 |title=Meet the voice of Super Mario Charles Martinet |publisher=Dailytelegraph.com.au |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref> N-Philes criticized Toadsworth's voice in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', calling it \"laughable\", \"comical\", and \"utterly pessimistic\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Gareth Trinkwon |url=http://www.n-philes.com/reviews/63/super-mario-sunshine/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903145402/http://www.n-philes.com/reviews/63/super-mario-sunshine/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-03 |title=News :: Super Mario Sunshine |publisher=N-Philes |accessdate=2010-04-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Supporting antagonists==\n===Boom Boom===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Boom Boom'''|\u30d6\u30f3\u30d6\u30f3|Bunbun|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the henchman and faithful servant of Bowser. He first appeared in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' as one of the main antagonists of the game, where he often fights with Mario or Luigi by chasing him flailing his arms, jumping high and flying at them. Boom Boom returned in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' 23 years after their last appearance. He resides in various airships where he encounters Mario. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', he reprises his old role from ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', guarding the fortresses and towers.\n\nIn four episodes of ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Boom Boom appears as a silent powerhouse who often cause troubles to Mario and Luigi.\n\n===Broodals===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Broodals'''|\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0\u30eb\u30ba|Bur\u016bdaruzu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are a group of villainous anthropomorphic [[rabbit]]s who double as wedding planners in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''. Their boss is Madame Broode. They were hired by Bowser in order to stop Mario from reaching him. The members consist of Topper, Hariet, Rango and Spewart.\n\n===Draggadon===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Draggadons'''|\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30c9\u30f3|Doragodon|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are [[dragon]]s first appearing in the game ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]''. Although in said game only Draggadon, the king of an isolated volcano called Pyropuff Peak, and Gold Draggadon, the king of the Golden Realm.\n\nThe first, named Draggadon, is fought in Episode 1-10: The King of Pyropuff Peak, Episode 2-9: Draggadon's Revenge, and Bonus Episode-11: Mummy-Me at Pyropuff Peak. When Captain Toad is chasing Wingo who kidnapped Toadette, he accidentally comes across Pyropuff Peak. Draggadon attacks him, thinking him to be an intruder, but after the fight realizes that he was innocent, and allows him to ride on his head as the two conquer hordes of enemies. Toadette in her pursuit of Wingo also ends up at Pyropuff Peak, which results in the same situation playing. Once again, Toadette befriends him, and they conquer even more enemies.\n\nUnlike Wingo, Draggadon is not battled directly. Captain Toad and Toadette must avoid his attacks to the end of the level by hiding behind walls, and at the end, knock a pillar on his head. He is then knocked unconscious, and the Toads collect the Power Star. Another Draggadon, named Gold Draggadon, also appears in a later episode, as the king of the Golden Realm. Like Draggadon, Captain Toad must also fight Gold Draggadon as boss, although fireballs will move faster and the lava will rise quicker, and after defeating him, he lets Captain Toad ride him.\n\n===Dry Bowser===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Dry Bowser'''|\u307b\u306d\u30af\u30c3\u30d1|Hone Kuppa|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a recurring antagonist in the ''Mario'' series. Debuting as a form of Bowser after losing his flesh in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'', the character has appeared as his own being starting with ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', often serving as the final antagonist in the main games.

Dry Bowser is a playable character in several of the Mario spin-off games.\n\n===Fawful===\n{{Main|Fawful}}\n\n'''{{nihongo foot|Fawful|\u30b2\u30e9\u30b3\u30d3\u30c3\u30c4|Gerakobittsu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}''', is a recurring antagonist in the ''[[Mario & Luigi]]'' series.

After being defeated by the Star Kid, Twink, she continued to work for him. In ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', she acted as Bowser's second-in-command. Generally, her position is very similar with Kamek who appeared earlier than her, which possibly means why she is replaced by him in ''[[Paper Mario: Sticker Star]]''. [[IGN]] rated her as one of the weirdest ''Mario'' characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.wii.ign.com/articles/119/1199242p3.html|title=Weirdest Mario Characters|first=Audrey|last=Drake|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n\n===King Bob-omb===\n{{nihongo foot|'''King Bob-omb'''|\u30dc\u30e0\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0|Bomu Kingu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the king of the Bob-ombs.

He is much larger than the average Boos that appear in games after ''Luigi's Mansion''. He dons a [[crown (headgear)|crown]] with a large ruby (as well as glowing, sunken eyes) in his appearances in the ''Luigi's Mansion'' franchise, as well as an appearance as a playable character in ''[[Mario Kart Tour]]'', but he wears a regular crown and has the eyes and face of a regular Boo in all other appearances.
