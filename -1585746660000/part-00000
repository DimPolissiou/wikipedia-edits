{"title_page": "Thomas de Mahy, Marquis de Favras", "text_new": "[[File:Marquisdefavras.jpeg|thumb|right|230px|Thomas de Mahy]]\n'''Thomas de Mahy, marquis de Favras''' (March 26, 1744 \u2013 February 19, 1790) was a [[France|French]] [[French nobility|aristocrat]] and supporter of the [[House of Bourbon]] during the [[French Revolution]]. Often seen as a martyr of the Royalist cause, Favras was executed for his part in \"planning against the people of France\" under the [[Louis XVIII of France|Comte de Provence]]. He is known for his [[last words]] \"I see that you have made three spelling mistakes\" upon the reading of his death sentence warrant.\n\n==Career==\n{{noref|section|date=November 2019}}\nBorn in Favras near [[Blois]], he belonged to an impoverished family whose nobility dated from the 12th century. At seventeen he was a [[Captain (land and air)|captain]] of [[dragoon]]s, and saw some service in the closing campaign of the [[Seven Years' War]]. In 1772 he became a first [[lieutenant]] in the [[Swiss_Guards#Swiss_Guards_.28Gardes_Suisses.29|Swiss Guard]]s of King [[Louis XVI]]'s younger brother, the [[Louis XVIII|Comte de Provence]]. Unable to meet the expenses of his rank, which was equivalent to that of a [[colonel]] in the army, he retired in 1775.\n\nIn 1776, Favras married Victoria Hedwig Karoline, Princess of [[Anhalt-Bernburg|Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg]], whose mother, after being deserted by her husband [[Karl Louis, Prince of Anhalt-Bernburg-Schaumburg-Hoym]] in 1749, had found refuge with her daughter in the house of [[Charles de Rohan, prince de Soubise]]. After his marriage, Favras went to [[Vienna]] to attempt the restitution of his wife's rights, and spent some time in [[Warsaw]]. In 1787 he was authorized to raise a \"patriotic legion\" to help the [[Dutch Republic]] against the [[Stadtholder]] [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]] and his [[Prussia]]n allies.\n\nReturning to [[Paris]] in 1789, he became involved in Royalist plans initiated by his former employer, the [[Louis XVIII of France|Comte de Provence]], to save the King and end the [[French Revolution]]. In order to finance this venture, Provence (using one of his gentlemen, the [[Claude de La Ch\u00e2tre|Comte de la Ch\u00e2tre]], as an intermediary) commissioned Favras to negotiate a loan of 2,000,000 [[French franc]]s from the bankers Schaumel and Sartorius.\n\n==Arrest, trial, and execution==\nIt was stated in a leaflet circulated throughout Paris on February 29th, 1789 that Favras had been hired by the [[Louis XVIII|Comte de Provence]] to organize an elaborate plot against the people of France. In this plot, the King, Queen and their children were to be rescued from the [[Tuileries Palace]] and spirited out of the country. Then the Comte de Provence was to be declared [[regent]] of the kingdom with absolute power. Simultaneously, a force of 30,000 soldiers was to encircle Paris. In the ensuing confusion, the city's three main liberal leaders ([[Jacques Necker]], the popular [[List of Finance Ministers of France|Finance Minister of France]], [[Jean Sylvain Bailly]], the [[List of mayors of Paris|mayor of Paris]], and the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de La Fayette|Marquis de La Fayette]], the commander of the city's new [[National Guard (France)|National Guard]]) were to be assassinated. Afterwards, the revolutionary city was to be starved into submission by cutting off its food supplies. As a consequence of the leaflet, Favras and his wife were arrested the next day, and imprisoned in the [[Prison de l'Abbaye|Abbaye Prison]]. Terrified of the consequences of the arrest, the Comte de Provence hastened to publicly disavow Favras, in a speech delivered before the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Commune of Paris]], and in a letter to the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]].\n\nA fortnight after the arrest, Favras and his wife were separated, and Favras was removed to the [[Grand Ch\u00e2telet]]. In the course of a trial that lasted nearly two months, witnesses disagreed about the facts concerning the case and evidence was lacking. Even [[Sylvain Mar\u00e9chal]], the anarchist editor of the republican newspaper ''R\u00e9volutions de Paris'', admitted that the evidence against Favras was insufficient. However, an armed attempt to free him by some Royalists on January 26, which was thwarted by La Fayette, aroused the suspicion of the Parisians, and on February 18, 1790, in spite of a notable defense plea, Favras was sentenced to be [[Hanging|hanged]].\n\nAfter he had previously implicated others in the conspiracy (most notably, the [[Louis-Alexandre de Launay, comte d'Antraigues|Comte d'Antraigues]]), Favras offered to give further information to the authorities on the plot's details and participants if reprieved but, denied that, refused to reveal more.<ref>{{cite web\n|date= 1837\n|last= Carlyle\n|first= Thomas\n|authorlink=Thomas Caryle\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L0gQAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA239&lpg=PA239&dq=offers+to+reveal+secrets,+if+they+will+save+him;+handsomely+declines+since+they+will+not;&source=bl&ots=5LESqW7-Gk&sig=t5_949dk-Ewb-fL6vzyhVMSXOPU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjTl9uRxqjPAhVEy2MKHRT2D1cQ6AEIITAB#v=onepage&q=offers%20to%20reveal%20secrets%2C%20if%20they%20will%20save%20him%3B%20handsomely%20declines%20since%20they%20will%20not%3B&f=false\n|title= The French Revolution: A History\n|accessdate= September 24, 2016\n|quote=[Favras] offers to reveal secrets, if they will save him; handsomely declines since they will not....\n}}</ref> His sentence was carried out in the [[Place de l'H\u00f4tel-de-Ville \u2013 Esplanade de la Lib\u00e9ration|Place de Gr\u00e8ve]] the next day - a measure which was received with enthusiasm by members of the Parisian population, since it was the first instance when no distinction in the mode of execution was allowed between noble and commoner.

Kirby of the Stars}}<!-- See [[WP:JFN]] -->}} is an [[Action game|action]]-[[Platform game|platformer]] [[video game]] series developed by [[HAL Laboratory]] and published by [[Nintendo]]. The series centers around the adventures of a young, pink alien hero named [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] as he fights to save his home on the distant Planet Popstar from a variety of threats. The majority of the games in the series are [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[Platform game|platformers]] with puzzle solving and [[beat 'em up]] elements. Kirby has the ability to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, spitting them out as a projectile or eating them. If he eats certain things he can gain the powers or properties of that object manifesting as a new weapon or power-up called a Copy Ability. The series is intended to be easy to pick up and play even for people unfamiliar with [[action game]]s, while at the same time offering additional challenge and depth for more experienced players to come back to.\n\npoyo\n\n==POYO==\nThe main [[protagonist]] of the ''Kirby'' series is a young, spherical 8-inch-tall alien boy named [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] who lives on a far away [[Five-pointed star|star]]-shaped planet called Popstar in the country of Dream Land. Much of Dream Land is peaceful and its people lead laid back and carefree lives. However, when peace in Dream Land is shattered from threats, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial in origin, it's up to Kirby to become a brave warrior and save his home. Despite his young and carefree personality; Kirby possesses many incredible abilities, such as the power to inhale objects and enemies, sucking them into his stretchy mouth and spitting them out with force. He can also take on the properties of enemies and objects that he eats to gain Copy Abilities, transforming into new forms and gaining new powers; such as breathing fire, wielding a sword, launching sparks in every direction, or attacking enemies with direct hand-to-hand combat.\n\nMany [[List of Kirby characters|recurring characters]] appear throughout the series both allies and enemies. The most frequent one being [[King Dedede]], a gluttonous blue penguin-like bird and self-proclaimed ruler of Dream Land. King Dedede has appeared in every ''Kirby'' game except for ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]''. King Dedede's selfish nature often leads him and Kirby to clash, however he sometimes teams up with Kirby when a greater threat appears. Another major character of the series is the enigmatic [[Meta Knight]], a chivalrous masked man who wishes to one day fight the strongest warrior in the galaxy and leads a band of like-minded warriors. Whenever he and Kirby duel, he will always offer Kirby a sword beforehand so that the fight is fair. While his true face resembles Kirby's, his exact relationship with Kirby remains a mystery.\n\nThe main ''Kirby'' games are side-scrolling action-platformers. Kirby must run, jump, and attack enemies while traversing through a number of areas, solving puzzles and fighting [[Boss (video games)|bosses]] along the way. One of the things that sets ''Kirby'' apart is Kirby's ability to inflate himself with a gulp of air and fly. In most games he can do this for as long as he likes however, his attack options are limited while doing so.\n\nKirby games often contain a number of hidden items that either unlock more parts to the game or are simple incentives to collect, and are usually required to achieve 100% completion in the game. These special items usually relate to the plot of the game, most often used to create a special weapon required to defeat the final boss. In some games, the special weapon is optional and can be used in the game regularly after defeating the final boss with it. These elements have remained constant throughout most the series, with each game having its own unique twist to affect gameplay.\n\nThe games' fantasy world of [[#Fictional universe|Popstar]] includes many regions of different climates and terrains, which are home to [[List of Kirby characters|many different creatures]]. Each game features uniquely named areas, but all games feature typical locations such as fiery mountains, open meadows, water-filled or submerged areas, icy snowfields, and similar nature-based places.\n\nThere are also several spinoff games in the series, which involve a variety of different gaming genres such as [[Kirby's Pinball Land|pinball]], puzzle, [[Kirby Air Ride|racing]], a game based on motion-sensor technology. A number of these side games take advantage of Kirby's round, ball-like appearance.\n\n==History==\n{{VG timeline\n|\n|poyo\n}}\n\n===1990s===\nThe first game in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' for the original [[Game Boy]], was released in Japan in April 1992 and later in North America in August that year. A simple game, consisting of five levels, it introduced Kirby's ability to inhale enemies and objects. The game contains an unlockable hard mode, known as the \"Extra Game\", which features stronger enemies and more difficult bosses. The North American box art showed a white Kirby, although the Japanese box art had the correct pink coloring.\n\npoyo\nAfter ''Kirby's Adventure'', the ''Kirby'' series received a number of spin-off games. ''[[Kirby's Pinball Land]]'', released in November 1993, is a pinball game featuring Kirby as the poyoball. ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]'', released in North America in February 1995, is a [[golf]]-based game which features an isometric graphic design. ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]'', released in February 1995 in North America and Europe, is a puzzle game, a westernized version of the Japanese game ''[[Puyo Puyo]]''.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'', released in Japan and North America in March 1995, brought the Copy Abilities from ''Kirby's Adventure'' to a handheld system, but due to system limitations lowered the number of abilities to seven. The game introduced three rideable animal companions: Rick the hamster, Coo the owl, and Kine the ocean sunfish. Pairing up with any of these three alters how Kirby's abilities work. The game was to be remade for the [[Game Boy Color]] as ''Kirby's Dream Land 2 DX'', but was cancelled.\n\n''[[Kirby's Block Ball]]'', released in November 1995 in North America, is a [[Breakout clone|variation]] of the game ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', featuring multiple levels, some of Kirby's Copy Abilities, and various enemies in unique boss battles.\n\n''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', known as ''Hoshi no Kirby Super Deluxe'' in Japan and ''Kirby's Fun Pak'' in Europe, was released in North America in September 1996. ''Kirby Super Star'' is composed of eight separate games, and features several characters and abilities which have not appeared since in the series. The game features \"Helpers\", which can be created by sacrificing the ability in use, to help the player dispatch enemies.\n\nIn 1996, a ''Kirby'' mini-game series, {{nihongo foot|''Kirby's Toy Box'',|\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u7bb1|K\u0101b\u012b no Omocha Hako|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released via the [[St.GIGA]] satellite broadcasting system for the [[Satellaview]]. These mini-games were given a unique broadcast date. Mini-game titles included: ''Arrange Ball'', ''Ball Rally'', ''Baseball'', ''Cannonball'', ''Guru Guru Ball'', ''Hoshi Kuzushi'', ''Pachinko'', and ''Pinball''.<ref>Andou, N.

The game received a sequel on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] in 1998 in Japan as ''[[Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu]]''.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'', released in November 1997 in North America, is a direct sequel to ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'', as it featured the return of Kirby's animal friends. Similarly to ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'', ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' features a few Copy Abilities which were modified when Kirby paired up with one of his six animal friends. The game had a multiplayer option with the second player controlling Gooey, a recurring character. The antagonist is Dark Matter, and if certain conditions are met, Zero was fought as the true final boss. The game had a unique pastel-drawing art style and used dithering to improve visual performance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Lucas M.|title=Kirby's Dreamland 3 Review|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/01/06/kirbys-dream-land-3-review|accessdate=28 June 2014|date=January 6, 2009|quote=Kirby's Dream Collection 3 (...) employed an advanced-for-the-time dithering effect to enhance the visuals.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirbysrainbowresort.net/games/dreamland3/|website=kirbysrainbowresort.net|title=Kirby's Rainbow Resort|accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nThe first game to have 3D graphics in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', was released on the [[Nintendo 64]] in North America in June 2000. The game features a compound ability system that allows two of the seven abilities in the game to be merged, making a new compound ability. It also marked the first playable instance of King Dedede, where sections of some stages had Kirby riding piggyback while King Dedede attacked enemies and obstacles with his hammer. It is considered a direct follow-up to ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' due to the reemergence of Dark Matter and the final boss, albeit in a different form, called 0<sup>2</sup> (Zero Two). It also included three four-player minigames.\n\nThe next game in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]'' became one of Nintendo's first motion-sensor-based games in August 2000. Players are instructed to tilt the Game Boy Color to move Kirby on the screen. Quickly flicking the Game Boy Color upwards would make Kirby jump into the air. ''Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble'' is the only ''Kirby'' game to have a special cartridge color (transparent pink) in North America.\n\nThe only ''Kirby'' game for the [[GameCube]], ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]'', was released in North America in October 2003. It is a racing game which deviates greatly from usual ''Kirby'' titles, although still featuring series staples including enemies and Copy Abilities.\n\nDuring the 2003 Holiday season, a Kirby [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-reader card]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]] was released. The card was released under two names, ''Kirby Slide'' and ''Kirby Puzzle''. Swiping the card would allow for a sliding puzzle game starring Kirby to be played.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEC30bnj0cU|title=Kirby Puzzle|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Cards were given out at [[Toys \"R\" Us]] stores and in the 2003 December issues of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' and ''[[Tips & Tricks (magazine)|Tips & Tricks]]''. The game was released to advertise the English dub of ''[[Kirby: Right Back At Ya!]]''\n\n''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'' was released in October 2004 on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. It is the second game released on that system, following ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land''. It features Kirby in a [[Metroidvania]] format, with all the levels being interconnected and able to be completed in any order. Also unique was the in-game phone, which can be used to summon up to three additional copies of Kirby to fight enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nThe next game in the series is ''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]'', released on the [[Nintendo DS]] in Japan on March 24, 2005, North America on June 13, 2005, Europe on November 25, 2005, and Australia on April 6, 2006. Unlike most previous ''Kirby'' games, the player does not directly control Kirby with a [[D-pad|directional pad]], [[analog stick]], face buttons, or shoulder buttons. Instead, Kirby is a helpless ball, and can only move when he gains momentum, the player painting paths with the stylus to direct his movement.\n\nThis was followed by ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'' in late 2006, also on the Nintendo DS, which revived traditional ''Kirby'' gameplay and dabbled in the use of the touch screen to store several items and Copy Abilities in Kirby's stomach. Ability scrolls could be found that served as upgrades for each ability, giving them additional moves and/or enhanced functionality. An unlockable Copy Ability was also introduced.\n\n''Kirby Super Star Ultra'', announced for the Nintendo DS in early fall 2007<ref>{{cite web |last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |date=October 11, 2007 |title=Second Hand Hands On from Japan |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/11/second-hand-hands-on-from-japan |publisher=IGN |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}</ref> and released on September 22, 2008<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/games/kirby-super-star-ultra/nds-14209932 |title=Kirby Super Star Ultra - Nintendo DS |publisher=IGN |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}</ref> in North America, is a remake of ''Kirby Super Star''. In addition to the nine games from ''Kirby Super Star'', seven new games have been added.

It included a multiplayer fighting mode called \"Kirby Fighters\", where players could choose one of ten available abilities and fight on themed stages, with the winner being the last Kirby standing. It also included a rhythm-based action game starring King Dedede. There were also over 250 in-game \"keychains\" to collect that featured sprites from previous Kirby games as well some original sprites based on characters from Triple Deluxe. In August 2014, Kirby Fighters Deluxe and Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe (enhanced versions of the mini-games in Kirby: Triple Deluxe) were released.\n\nAt E3 2014, a new game for the [[Wii U]] was announced.

He is referred to as male in the animated series, and described as a young boy in the instruction manual for ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]''. His body is soft and flexible, allowing him to stretch his mouth to inhale foes or inflate himself with air and float. According to ''Super Smash Bros.'' instruction manual, he is 8 inches tall; this is contradicted in ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' and ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards'', the former of which shows Kirby to be at about [[knee]] height compared to [[Samus Aran]] and the latter of which showing him to be a few inches shorter than the human girl Adeleine.\n\nKirby hails from the country of Dream Land on Planet Popstar, where he lives in a domed house. His appearance has changed subtly over the years, becoming more rounded and defined, mainly in his face and larger eyes. The new design has been used in all subsequent games.\n\nKirby does not commonly speak, mainly limited to grunts, shouts, and monosyllables in such games as ''Super Smash Bros'' and ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards''. However he does speak in the stories written in some games' instruction manuals. He rarely speaks in-game, the only exception being ''Kirby's Avalanche''. He narrates the functions of Copy Abilities on the start menu in ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'', ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'' and ''Kirby: Squeak Squad''. Most in-game talking Kirby does is in ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker]]'', where Kirby explains the game's rules and gameplay. Kirby has dialogue in ''Kirby's Epic Yarn'', but it is all spoken through the game's narrator.\n\n==Other media==\n===POYO===\npoyo\n\n===Comics and manga===\nKirby stars in several [[manga]] series, none of which have been released outside of Japan yet. The longest running series is ''Kirby of the Stars'' (a rough English translation of ''Hoshi no Kirby''), written by Hirokazu Hikawa. This series was announced for a release in America by VIZ Media, but was never actually released.\n\nOther ''Kirby'' manga are typically one-shot comedy [[4koma]] based on the games, and have multiple artists. They have recurring themes and [[running gag]]s.\n\nKirby also appears in several German comics, featuring him as a detective and King Dedede as his friend. His animal friends appear as pets of a female Kirby look-alike with red glass slippers. In one comic, he meets Lolo, Lala, and Lulu, the protagonists of the ''[[Adventures of Lolo]]'' series. The German comics were meant to let German ''Kirby'' fans know of ''Kirby'' games which would be released there.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===Cancelled games===\nIn the lifetime of the ''Kirby'' series, several video games have been in development that, for various reasons, were ultimately abandoned. Such titles include ''Kirby's Air Ride 64'' (also known as ''Kirby Bowl 64'' and ''Kirby Ball 64'') on the Nintendo 64,<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Kirby Ball 64 |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1996|page=79}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Kirby Bowl 64 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=90 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1996|page=23}}</ref> which was eventually released on the GameCube as ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]''.\n\n''Kirby's Tilt 'n' Tumble 2'' on the GameCube, which was supposed to use a combination of motion-sensor technology and connectivity to the Game Boy Advance via the [[Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable]].<ref>The game was presented during the Nintendo Space World 2001</ref>\n\nThere was also a planned game called ''Kid Kirby'' that was to be released on the Super Nintendo.<ref>''Other Stuff: Nintendo News''. [[DieHard GameFan]]. Volume 3. Issue 6. Number 30. Pg.129. June 1995.</ref> The game would have served as a prequel to the series and would have utilized the SNES mouse. The game was cancelled due to the declining sales of the mouse; however, early screenshots of the cancelled game have been posted online. This unreleased game was developed by [[DMA Design]] for Nintendo and was scheduled for 1995.\n\nThough resurfaced as ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', the GameCube was initially going to have its own original Kirby game, simply titled ''Kirby Adventure'' at the time. It was nearly complete and featured at E3 2005, but was cancelled due to troubles incorporating a unique multiplayer mechanic, which became the special attack in ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'' (where all players stack on each other, hold A and release at the same time). Most of ''Kirby Adventure'' was scrapped in the game it became to be, such as the helper system that was featured in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' which made a return in the GameCube version of the game before cancellation, as well as having faster-paced gameplay similar to ''Kirby Super Star''. Such concepts would be revitalized in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'' for the [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\n===''Kirby'' in other video games===\n[[File:Kirby Characters in Smash.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Meta Knight]], [[King Dedede]] and [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]]  in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'']]\nKirby appears as a character in Nintendo's crossover [[fighting game]] series ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' (also developed by series creator Masahiro Sakurai), appearing in all installments of the franchise. Starting with ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' onwards, he's joined by [[Meta Knight]] and [[King Dedede]]. Many items from the Kirby series also appear in ''Super Smash Bros'' such as the Maxim Tomato (all games), Warp Star (since ''Melee''), Dragoon (since ''Brawl'') and Star Rod (all games) as items, and Knuckle Joe (''Brawl'' and ''3DS/Wii U''), Nightmare (''3DS/Wii U'') and Chef Kawasaki (''Ultimate'') appear as characters summoned by the Assist Trophy. All playable Kirby characters in ''Smash Bros.'' have the ability to jump more than twice. Kirby has also made cameo appearances in other games as well, such as ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening]]'', ''[[EarthBound]]'', ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and ''[[Stunt Race FX]]''.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Expand section|date=May 2018}}\nThe ''Kirby'' games have received reception that ranges from mixed to very favourable reviews by players and critics.

Kirby of the Stars}}<!-- See [[WP:JFN]] -->}} is an [[Action game|action]]-[[Platform game|platformer]] [[video game]] series developed by [[HAL Laboratory]] and published by [[Nintendo]]. The series centers around the adventures of a young, pink alien hero named [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] as he fights to save his home on the distant Planet Popstar from a variety of threats. The majority of the games in the series are [[Side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[Platform game|platformers]] with puzzle solving and [[beat 'em up]] elements. Kirby has the ability to inhale enemies and objects into his mouth, spitting them out as a projectile or eating them. If he eats certain things he can gain the powers or properties of that object manifesting as a new weapon or power-up called a Copy Ability. The series is intended to be easy to pick up and play even for people unfamiliar with [[action game]]s, while at the same time offering additional challenge and depth for more experienced players to come back to.\n\nThe ''Kirby'' series includes a total of over [[List of Kirby games|twenty games]], and has sold over 34 million units worldwide, putting it in the top 50 best-selling video game franchises of all time.\n\n==Overview==\nThe main [[protagonist]] of the ''Kirby'' series is a young, spherical 8-inch-tall alien boy named [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]] who lives on a far away [[Five-pointed star|star]]-shaped planet called Popstar in the country of Dream Land. Much of Dream Land is peaceful and its people lead laid back and carefree lives. However, when peace in Dream Land is shattered from threats, both terrestrial and extraterrestrial in origin, it's up to Kirby to become a brave warrior and save his home. Despite his young and carefree personality; Kirby possesses many incredible abilities, such as the power to inhale objects and enemies, sucking them into his stretchy mouth and spitting them out with force. He can also take on the properties of enemies and objects that he eats to gain Copy Abilities, transforming into new forms and gaining new powers; such as breathing fire, wielding a sword, launching sparks in every direction, or attacking enemies with direct hand-to-hand combat.\n\nMany [[List of Kirby characters|recurring characters]] appear throughout the series both allies and enemies. The most frequent one being [[King Dedede]], a gluttonous blue penguin-like bird and self-proclaimed ruler of Dream Land. King Dedede has appeared in every ''Kirby'' game except for ''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]''. King Dedede's selfish nature often leads him and Kirby to clash, however he sometimes teams up with Kirby when a greater threat appears. Another major character of the series is the enigmatic [[Meta Knight]], a chivalrous masked man who wishes to one day fight the strongest warrior in the galaxy and leads a band of like-minded warriors. Whenever he and Kirby duel, he will always offer Kirby a sword beforehand so that the fight is fair. While his true face resembles Kirby's, his exact relationship with Kirby remains a mystery.\n\nThe main ''Kirby'' games are side-scrolling action-platformers. Kirby must run, jump, and attack enemies while traversing through a number of areas, solving puzzles and fighting [[Boss (video games)|bosses]] along the way. One of the things that sets ''Kirby'' apart is Kirby's ability to inflate himself with a gulp of air and fly. In most games he can do this for as long as he likes however, his attack options are limited while doing so.\n\nKirby games often contain a number of hidden items that either unlock more parts to the game or are simple incentives to collect, and are usually required to achieve 100% completion in the game. These special items usually relate to the plot of the game, most often used to create a special weapon required to defeat the final boss. In some games, the special weapon is optional and can be used in the game regularly after defeating the final boss with it. These elements have remained constant throughout most the series, with each game having its own unique twist to affect gameplay.\n\nThe games' fantasy world of [[#Fictional universe|Popstar]] includes many regions of different climates and terrains, which are home to [[List of Kirby characters|many different creatures]]. Each game features uniquely named areas, but all games feature typical locations such as fiery mountains, open meadows, water-filled or submerged areas, icy snowfields, and similar nature-based places.\n\nThere are also several spinoff games in the series, which involve a variety of different gaming genres such as [[Kirby's Pinball Land|pinball]], puzzle, [[Kirby Air Ride|racing]], a game based on motion-sensor technology. A number of these side games take advantage of Kirby's round, ball-like appearance.\n\n==History==\n{{VG timeline\n|\n| range1 = 1992 -\n| range1_color = #FFB6C1 #DB7093\n| 1992 = '''''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'''''\n| 1993a = '''''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'''''\n| 1993b = ''[[Kirby's Pinball Land]]''\n| 1994 = ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]''\n| 1995a = ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]''\n| 1995b = '''''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'''''\n| 1995c = ''[[Kirby's Block Ball]]''\n| 1996 = '''''[[Kirby Super Star]]'''''\n| 1997a =  ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker]]''\n| 1997b = '''''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'''''\n| 1998 = ''[[Kirby's Super Star Stacker]]''\n| 2000a = '''''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'''''\n| 2000b = ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]''\n| 2002 = '''''[[Kirby's Adventure|Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land]]'''''\n| 2003 = ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]''\n| 2004 = '''''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'''''\n| 2005 = '''''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]'''''\n| 2006 = '''''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'''''\n| 2008 = '''''[[Kirby Super Star#Kirby Super Star Ultra|Kirby Super Star Ultra]]'''''\n| 2010 = '''''[[Kirby's Epic Yarn]]'''''\n| 2011a = '''''[[Kirby Mass Attack]]'''''\n| 2011b = '''''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'''''\n| 2012 = ''[[Kirby's Dream Collection]]''\n| 2014a = '''''[[Kirby: Triple Deluxe]]'''''\n| 2014b = ''[[Kirby Fighters Deluxe]]''\n| 2014c = ''[[Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe]]''\n| 2015 = '''''[[Kirby and the Rainbow Curse]]'''''\n| 2016 = '''''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]'''''\n| 2017a = ''[[Team Kirby Clash Deluxe]]''\n| 2017b = ''[[Kirby's Blowout Blast]]''\n| 2017c = ''[[Kirby Battle Royale]]''\n| 2018b = '''''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'''''\n| 2019a =  '''''[[Kirby\u2019s Extra Epic Yarn]]'''''\n| 2019b = ''Super Kirby Clash''\n}}\n\n===1990s===\nThe first game in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'' for the original [[Game Boy]], was released in Japan in April 1992 and later in North America in August that year. A simple game, consisting of five levels, it introduced Kirby's ability to inhale enemies and objects. The game contains an unlockable hard mode, known as the \"Extra Game\", which features stronger enemies and more difficult bosses. The North American box art showed a white Kirby, although the Japanese box art had the correct pink coloring.\n\nThe second game, ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', was released in North America in May 1993. ''Kirby's Adventure'' gave Kirby the ability to gain special powers when he ate certain enemies, called Copy Abilities; the game contained a total of 25 different ones to use. These powers replaced Kirby's inhale and could be used until Kirby sustained damage causing him to drop the ability, or the player voluntarily discarded it to obtain another one. As one of the last games created for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], ''Kirby's Adventure'' featured advanced graphics and sound that pushed the hardware's capabilities to the limit, including pseudo 3D effects on some stages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirbysrainbowresort.net/games/adventure/|website=kirbysrainbowresort.net|title=Kirby's Rainbow Resort|accessdate=28 June 2014|quote=It featured better than ever NES graphics, a big variety of tunes and extras galore to keep all ages glued to this classic game.}}</ref> It was re-released in 2002 on the [[Game Boy Advance]], retitled as ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'', featuring updated graphics and sound, multiplayer support, and the ability to play as [[Meta Knight]].\n\nAfter ''Kirby's Adventure'', the ''Kirby'' series received a number of spin-off games. ''[[Kirby's Pinball Land]]'', released in November 1993, is a pinball game featuring Kirby as the pinball. ''[[Kirby's Dream Course]]'', released in North America in February 1995, is a [[golf]]-based game which features an isometric graphic design. ''[[Kirby's Avalanche]]'', released in February 1995 in North America and Europe, is a puzzle game, a westernized version of the Japanese game ''[[Puyo Puyo]]''.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 2]]'', released in Japan and North America in March 1995, brought the Copy Abilities from ''Kirby's Adventure'' to a handheld system, but due to system limitations lowered the number of abilities to seven. The game introduced three rideable animal companions: Rick the hamster, Coo the owl, and Kine the ocean sunfish. Pairing up with any of these three alters how Kirby's abilities work. The game was to be remade for the [[Game Boy Color]] as ''Kirby's Dream Land 2 DX'', but was cancelled.\n\n''[[Kirby's Block Ball]]'', released in November 1995 in North America, is a [[Breakout clone|variation]] of the game ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', featuring multiple levels, some of Kirby's Copy Abilities, and various enemies in unique boss battles.\n\n''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', known as ''Hoshi no Kirby Super Deluxe'' in Japan and ''Kirby's Fun Pak'' in Europe, was released in North America in September 1996. ''Kirby Super Star'' is composed of eight separate games, and features several characters and abilities which have not appeared since in the series. The game features \"Helpers\", which can be created by sacrificing the ability in use, to help the player dispatch enemies.\n\nIn 1996, a ''Kirby'' mini-game series, {{nihongo foot|''Kirby's Toy Box'',|\u30ab\u30fc\u30d3\u30a3\u306e\u304a\u3082\u3061\u3083\u7bb1|K\u0101b\u012b no Omocha Hako|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released via the [[St.GIGA]] satellite broadcasting system for the [[Satellaview]].

The game received a sequel on the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Famicom]] in 1998 in Japan as ''[[Kirby no Kirakira Kizzu]]''.\n\n''[[Kirby's Dream Land 3]]'', released in November 1997 in North America, is a direct sequel to ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'', as it featured the return of Kirby's animal friends. Similarly to ''Kirby's Dream Land 2'', ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' features a few Copy Abilities which were modified when Kirby paired up with one of his six animal friends. The game had a multiplayer option with the second player controlling Gooey, a recurring character. The antagonist is Dark Matter, and if certain conditions are met, Zero was fought as the true final boss. The game had a unique pastel-drawing art style and used dithering to improve visual performance.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Lucas M.|title=Kirby's Dreamland 3 Review|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/01/06/kirbys-dream-land-3-review|accessdate=28 June 2014|date=January 6, 2009|quote=Kirby's Dream Collection 3 (...) employed an advanced-for-the-time dithering effect to enhance the visuals.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirbysrainbowresort.net/games/dreamland3/|website=kirbysrainbowresort.net|title=Kirby's Rainbow Resort|accessdate=28 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nThe first game to have 3D graphics in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', was released on the [[Nintendo 64]] in North America in June 2000. The game features a compound ability system that allows two of the seven abilities in the game to be merged, making a new compound ability. It also marked the first playable instance of King Dedede, where sections of some stages had Kirby riding piggyback while King Dedede attacked enemies and obstacles with his hammer. It is considered a direct follow-up to ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' due to the reemergence of Dark Matter and the final boss, albeit in a different form, called 0<sup>2</sup> (Zero Two). It also included three four-player minigames.\n\nThe next game in the ''Kirby'' series, ''[[Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble]]'' became one of Nintendo's first motion-sensor-based games in August 2000. Players are instructed to tilt the Game Boy Color to move Kirby on the screen. Quickly flicking the Game Boy Color upwards would make Kirby jump into the air. ''Kirby Tilt 'n' Tumble'' is the only ''Kirby'' game to have a special cartridge color (transparent pink) in North America.\n\nThe only ''Kirby'' game for the [[GameCube]], ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]'', was released in North America in October 2003. It is a racing game which deviates greatly from usual ''Kirby'' titles, although still featuring series staples including enemies and Copy Abilities.\n\nDuring the 2003 Holiday season, a Kirby [[Nintendo e-Reader|e-reader card]] for the [[Game Boy Advance]] was released. The card was released under two names, ''Kirby Slide'' and ''Kirby Puzzle''. Swiping the card would allow for a sliding puzzle game starring Kirby to be played.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEC30bnj0cU|title=Kirby Puzzle|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Cards were given out at [[Toys \"R\" Us]] stores and in the 2003 December issues of ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' and ''[[Tips & Tricks (magazine)|Tips & Tricks]]''. The game was released to advertise the English dub of ''[[Kirby: Right Back At Ya!]]''\n\n''[[Kirby & the Amazing Mirror]]'' was released in October 2004 on the [[Game Boy Advance]]. It is the second game released on that system, following ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land''. It features Kirby in a [[Metroidvania]] format, with all the levels being interconnected and able to be completed in any order. Also unique was the in-game phone, which can be used to summon up to three additional copies of Kirby to fight enemies and solve puzzles.\n\nThe next game in the series is ''[[Kirby: Canvas Curse]]'', released on the [[Nintendo DS]] in Japan on March 24, 2005, North America on June 13, 2005, Europe on November 25, 2005, and Australia on April 6, 2006. Unlike most previous ''Kirby'' games, the player does not directly control Kirby with a [[D-pad|directional pad]], [[analog stick]], face buttons, or shoulder buttons. Instead, Kirby is a helpless ball, and can only move when he gains momentum, the player painting paths with the stylus to direct his movement.\n\nThis was followed by ''[[Kirby: Squeak Squad]]'' in late 2006, also on the Nintendo DS, which revived traditional ''Kirby'' gameplay and dabbled in the use of the touch screen to store several items and Copy Abilities in Kirby's stomach. Ability scrolls could be found that served as upgrades for each ability, giving them additional moves and/or enhanced functionality. An unlockable Copy Ability was also introduced.\n\n''Kirby Super Star Ultra'', announced for the Nintendo DS in early fall 2007<ref>{{cite web |last=Gantayat |first=Anoop |date=October 11, 2007 |title=Second Hand Hands On from Japan |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/10/11/second-hand-hands-on-from-japan |publisher=IGN |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}</ref> and released on September 22, 2008<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/games/kirby-super-star-ultra/nds-14209932 |title=Kirby Super Star Ultra - Nintendo DS |publisher=IGN |accessdate=October 9, 2016}}</ref> in North America, is a remake of ''Kirby Super Star''.

The game was released in Japan on January 11, 2014, in North America on May 2, 2014, in Europe on May 16, 2014, and in Australasia on May 17, 2014. It incorporated action spanning varied depths, where Kirby could swap between the foreground and background areas. It included a multiplayer fighting mode called \"Kirby Fighters\", where players could choose one of ten available abilities and fight on themed stages, with the winner being the last Kirby standing. It also included a rhythm-based action game starring King Dedede. There were also over 250 in-game \"keychains\" to collect that featured sprites from previous Kirby games as well some original sprites based on characters from Triple Deluxe. In August 2014, Kirby Fighters Deluxe and Dedede's Drum Dash Deluxe (enhanced versions of the mini-games in Kirby: Triple Deluxe) were released.\n\nAt E3 2014, a new game for the [[Wii U]] was announced. Titled ''[[Kirby and the Rainbow Curse]]'', the game is a direct sequel to ''Kirby: Canvas Curse'' and features a similar gameplay style. It was released by Nintendo on January 22, 2015 in Japan, February 20, 2015 in North America, May 8, 2015 in Europe and May 9, 2015 in Australasia.\n\nIn March 2016, during a Nintendo Direct, Nintendo unveiled a new game based on the context of ''Kirby: Triple Deluxe'' called ''[[Kirby: Planet Robobot]]''.

Pupupu Land}}}} a country on Planet Popstar. Popstar resembles a [[five-pointed star]] encircled by two diagonal [[Ring system|rings]].\n\nWhile most of Kirby's adventures take place on Popstar, his journeys occasionally take place on an interplanetary scale; such as in ''[[Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards]]'', ''Milky Way Wishes'' from ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'', ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', and ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]''.\n\n==Nature of the protagonist==\n{{main|Kirby (character)}}\nKirby is a small, pink, spherical alien with red feet, stubby flap-like arms and pink cheek-blushes. He is referred to as male in the animated series, and described as a young boy in the instruction manual for ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]''. His body is soft and flexible, allowing him to stretch his mouth to inhale foes or inflate himself with air and float. According to ''Super Smash Bros.'' instruction manual, he is 8 inches tall; this is contradicted in ''Kirby's Dream Land 3'' and ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards'', the former of which shows Kirby to be at about [[knee]] height compared to [[Samus Aran]] and the latter of which showing him to be a few inches shorter than the human girl Adeleine.\n\nKirby hails from the country of Dream Land on Planet Popstar, where he lives in a domed house. His appearance has changed subtly over the years, becoming more rounded and defined, mainly in his face and larger eyes. The new design has been used in all subsequent games.\n\nKirby does not commonly speak, mainly limited to grunts, shouts, and monosyllables in such games as ''Super Smash Bros'' and ''Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards''. However he does speak in the stories written in some games' instruction manuals. He rarely speaks in-game, the only exception being ''Kirby's Avalanche''. He narrates the functions of Copy Abilities on the start menu in ''Kirby: Nightmare in Dream Land'', ''Kirby & the Amazing Mirror'' and ''Kirby: Squeak Squad''. Most in-game talking Kirby does is in ''[[Kirby's Star Stacker]]'', where Kirby explains the game's rules and gameplay. Kirby has dialogue in ''Kirby's Epic Yarn'', but it is all spoken through the game's narrator.\n\n==Other media==\n===Anime===\n{{main|Kirby: Right Back at Ya!}}\nThe ''Kirby'' series was made into an [[anime]] on October 6, 2001, originally titled ''Hoshi no Kaabii''. It was produced by Warpstar Inc., a company formed between a joint investment between Nintendo and HAL Laboratory, Inc. It was licensed in North America by [[4Kids Entertainment]], under the title ''Kirby: Right Back at Ya!'', on [[4Kids TV]], and was distributed by [[4Kids Entertainment]] in North America and [[Nelvana Limited]] in Canada, with VHS and DVD distributions in North America by [[FUNimation Entertainment]] and DVD distributions in Australia by [[Magna Pacific]]. It ended in Japan in 2003 with 100 episodes.\n\nThe show is about the adventures Kirby has with his friends Tiff and Tuff after he crash lands in Dream Land, on Pop Star. Here, he is a legendary Star Warrior destined to save the universe from the intergalactic conqueror known as Nightmare. However, because he was awakened 200 years too early he arrived in a childlike state and his powers haven't fully developed. The ruler of Dream Land, [[King Dedede]], is jealous of the attention Kirby receives from its inhabitants and frequently orders monsters from Nightmare's company, [[Nightmare Enterprises]], in an attempt to do away with Kirby. [[Nightmare Enterprises]] at first appears to be an intergalactic delivery company, but is really a front for Nightmare's intergalactic conquest that dupes unsuspecting customers into funding Nightmare's armies. Not yet ready to achieve his destiny, Kirby must learn how to use his incredible abilities with the help of his friends, and sometimes with the help of the enigmatic [[Meta Knight]], who while he claims to be loyal to King Dedede, will often work behind the scenes in order to aid Kirby or train him in the use of his abilities.\n\nThe show is based on the game series, but rather than being a direct adaptation of any of the games it uses characters and concepts from the games (especially ''[[Kirby's Dream Land]]'', ''[[Kirby's Adventure]]'', and ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'') to tell its own story.\n\n===Comics and manga===\nKirby stars in several [[manga]] series, none of which have been released outside of Japan yet. The longest running series is ''Kirby of the Stars'' (a rough English translation of ''Hoshi no Kirby''), written by Hirokazu Hikawa. This series was announced for a release in America by VIZ Media, but was never actually released.\n\nOther ''Kirby'' manga are typically one-shot comedy [[4koma]] based on the games, and have multiple artists. They have recurring themes and [[running gag]]s.\n\nKirby also appears in several German comics, featuring him as a detective and King Dedede as his friend. His animal friends appear as pets of a female Kirby look-alike with red glass slippers. In one comic, he meets Lolo, Lala, and Lulu, the protagonists of the ''[[Adventures of Lolo]]'' series. The German comics were meant to let German ''Kirby'' fans know of ''Kirby'' games which would be released there.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}\n\n===Cancelled games===\nIn the lifetime of the ''Kirby'' series, several video games have been in development that, for various reasons, were ultimately abandoned. Such titles include ''Kirby's Air Ride 64'' (also known as ''Kirby Bowl 64'' and ''Kirby Ball 64'') on the Nintendo 64,<ref>{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Kirby Ball 64 |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=78|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=January 1996|page=79}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Kirby Bowl 64 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=90 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=March 1996|page=23}}</ref> which was eventually released on the GameCube as ''[[Kirby Air Ride]]''.\n\n''Kirby's Tilt 'n' Tumble 2'' on the GameCube, which was supposed to use a combination of motion-sensor technology and connectivity to the Game Boy Advance via the [[Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance Cable]].<ref>The game was presented during the Nintendo Space World 2001</ref>\n\nThere was also a planned game called ''Kid Kirby'' that was to be released on the Super Nintendo.<ref>''Other Stuff: Nintendo News''. [[DieHard GameFan]]. Volume 3. Issue 6. Number 30. Pg.129. June 1995.</ref> The game would have served as a prequel to the series and would have utilized the SNES mouse. The game was cancelled due to the declining sales of the mouse; however, early screenshots of the cancelled game have been posted online. This unreleased game was developed by [[DMA Design]] for Nintendo and was scheduled for 1995.\n\nThough resurfaced as ''[[Kirby's Return to Dream Land]]'', the GameCube was initially going to have its own original Kirby game, simply titled ''Kirby Adventure'' at the time. It was nearly complete and featured at E3 2005, but was cancelled due to troubles incorporating a unique multiplayer mechanic, which became the special attack in ''Kirby's Return to Dream Land'' (where all players stack on each other, hold A and release at the same time). Most of ''Kirby Adventure'' was scrapped in the game it became to be, such as the helper system that was featured in ''[[Kirby Super Star]]'' which made a return in the GameCube version of the game before cancellation, as well as having faster-paced gameplay similar to ''Kirby Super Star''. Such concepts would be revitalized in ''[[Kirby Star Allies]]'' for the [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\n===''Kirby'' in other video games===\n[[File:Kirby Characters in Smash.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Meta Knight]], [[King Dedede]] and [[Kirby (character)|Kirby]]  in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'']]\nKirby appears as a character in Nintendo's crossover [[fighting game]] series ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' (also developed by series creator Masahiro Sakurai), appearing in all installments of the franchise. Starting with ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' onwards, he's joined by [[Meta Knight]] and [[King Dedede]]. Many items from the Kirby series also appear in ''Super Smash Bros'' such as the Maxim Tomato (all games), Warp Star (since ''Melee''), Dragoon (since ''Brawl'') and Star Rod (all games) as items, and Knuckle Joe (''Brawl'' and ''3DS/Wii U''), Nightmare (''3DS/Wii U'') and Chef Kawasaki (''Ultimate'') appear as characters summoned by the Assist Trophy.

{"title_page": "Blunder (chess)", "text_new": "In [[chess]], a '''blunder''' is a very bad move. It is usually caused by some tactical oversight, whether from [[time trouble]], overconfidence or carelessness. While a blunder may seem like a stroke of luck for the opposing player, some chess players give their opponent plenty of opportunities to blunder.\n\nWhat qualifies as a \"blunder\" rather than a normal mistake is somewhat subjective. A weak move from a novice player might be explained by the player's lack of skill, while the same move from a master might be called a blunder. In [[punctuation (chess)|chess annotation]], blunders are typically marked with a double question mark, \"{{chesspunc|??}}\", after the move.\n\nEspecially among amateur and novice players, blunders often occur because of a faulty thought process where they do not consider the opponent's {{chessgloss|forcing moves}}. In particular, [[Check (chess)|checks]], {{chessgloss|captures}}, and {{chessgloss|threats}} need to be considered at each move. Neglecting these possibilities leaves a player vulnerable to simple tactical errors.<ref>The principle of looking for checks, captures, and threats is repeated often by [[Dan Heisman]], see e.g. {{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/heisman14.pdf|title=A Generic Thought Process|last=Heisman|first=Dan|date=March 2002|publisher=The Chess Cafe|accessdate=2 August 2010}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/heisman65.pdf|title=Is It Safe?|last=Heisman|first=Dan|date=June 2006|publisher=The Chess Cafe|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nOne technique formerly recommended to avoid blunders was to write down the planned move on the {{chessgloss|score sheet}}, then take one last look before making it.<ref>\"When you have finished analyzing all the variations and gone along all the branches of the tree of analysis you must first of all write the move down on your score sheet, before you play it.\" [[Alexander Kotov]], ''Think Like a Grandmaster'', Chess Digest, 1971, pp. 73\u201374.</ref><ref>[[Simon Webb (chess player)|Simon Webb]], ''Chess for Tigers'' (3rd ed. 2005), pp. 121\u201322.</ref> This practice was not uncommon even at the [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] level.<ref>Webb wrote of the practice, \"You've seen other players doing it\". Webb 2005, p. 121.</ref> However, in 2005 the International Chess Federation ([[FIDE]]) banned it, instead requiring that the move be made before being written down.<ref>[http://www.fide.com/official/handbook.asp?level=EE101 FIDE Laws of Chess], see article 8.1 on recording of the moves</ref><ref>The editors of ''Chess for Tigers'' noted that after author Webb had submitted his manuscript, \"FIDE ... passed new laws forbidding a player to write moves down in advance and also insisting that a player's scoresheet be visible to the arbiter throughout the game\".

[[Mikhail Chigorin|Chigorin]], playing White, is a piece up ([[Wilhelm Steinitz|Steinitz]] lost a knight for a pawn earlier in the game), but his bishop is forced to stay on d6 to protect both the rook on e7 and the pawn on h2. If he won, Chigorin would have tied the match and sent it to a tiebreaker game. After 31...Rcd2, he played '''32. Bb4??'''.

[[Tigran Petrosian|Petrosian]], playing White, enjoys a clear advantage with strong [[knight (chess)|knight]]s, active [[rook (chess)|rook]]s and plenty of mobility while Black's position is congested and he is hardly able to move. In fact, [[David Bronstein|Bronstein]] (playing Black) has for the last seven moves been making only apparently aimless knight moves, Nc6\u2013d4\u2013c6\u2013d4, and now has played ...Nd4\u2013f5, threatening White's queen, while White has been slowly strengthening his position. White can now easily preserve the positional advantage by a move like 36.Qc7, but overlooking that the queen was ''{{chessgloss|en prise}}'', he played '''36.

Fischer played the blunder '''30... Nd6??''' cutting the game short. After Najdorf played 31. Nxd6, Fischer {{chessgloss|resigned}} because he realized after Najdorf's response that 31...Qxd6 32.Nxb7 wins a piece because 32...Rxb7 33.Qc8+ is a [[fork (chess)|fork]] that wins the rook on b7, so White wins at least a {{chessgloss|minor piece}}.\n\nNajdorf commented on Black's 29...Rb8: \"There is no satisfactory defense. If 29... Ba8 then 30. Nb6 or 30. Qf5 would win. ... I had to win minor {{chessgloss|material}} (the pawn at f4) but this [30... Nd6{{chesspunc|?}}] decides immediately.

Karpov, playing Black, is threatening a [[back-rank mate]] with 39...Rc1#. Korchnoi could have prevented this by moving his g-pawn (but not the h-pawn because 39.h3 or h4 leads to 39...Rc1+ 40.Kh2 Nf1+ 41.Kg1 Nfg3+ 42.Kh2 Rh1#), providing an escape square for his king. In serious time trouble, Korchnoi played {{nowrap|'''39. Ra1??'''}} and resigned after 39...Nf3+! with the forced checkmate after 40. gxf3 Rg6+ 41. Kh1 Nf2# or 40.Kh1 Nf2#.

In the diagram position, Chandler is completely winning. His opponent, [[Susan Polgar]], played the wily trap 53...Ng8\u2013h6{{chesspunc|!?}}. Chandler realized that after 54.gxh6+ Kxh6 he will be left with the considerable {{chessgloss|material}} advantage of a {{chessgloss|rook pawn}} and [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] against a [[bare king]]. However, since the bishop is unable to control the [[promotion (chess)|promotion]] square h8, Black will draw if she is able to get her king to control h8 due to the [[wrong rook pawn]] [[fortress (chess)|fortress]]. But Chandler calculates further, and realizes that it is ''he'' who will win control over the h8 square after 55.Kf6, and thereby win the game.<ref>[[Andrew Soltis]], ''Chess to Enjoy'' in September 1997 ''[[Chess Life]]''</ref>\n\nTherefore, Chandler played '''54. gxh6+??''', but instead of the expected 54...Kxh6 came 54...Kh8! This is in fact almost the same king, bishop, and rook pawn versus bare king situation as Chandler had calculated that he would avoid, and the small difference that White has ''two'' rook pawns rather than one has no effect on the result. Black controls the h8 square and cannot be chased or squeezed away from it, and so White cannot promote his pawn. After 55.Bd5 Kh7 56.Kf7 Kh8 the players [[draw by agreement|agreed to a draw]].\n\nChandler had numerous moves that would have maintained his winning position, the fastest according to the Shredder [[tablebase]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shredderchess.com/online-chess/online-databases/endgame-database.html|title=Shredder Computer Chess Download - Endgame Database|publisher=|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref> are 54.h4 and 54.Bf5.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Alexander Beliavsky vs. Leif Erlend Johannessen===\n{{Chess diagram\n| tleft\n| \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |  |  |  |  |pd|  |kd\n|  |  |pd|  |  |  |pd|  \n|  |  |  |pd|  |pl|ql|pd\n|  |  |  |pl|  |  |  |pl\n|  |  |  |  |pl|pl|kl|  \n|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  \n|  |qd|  |  |  |  |  |  \n| White to make his 69th move \n}}\nThis example, from a game played in [[Linares chess tournament|Linares]] in 2002, is one of the very rare circumstances where a grandmaster makes the worst move possible, the only one allowing [[checkmate]] on the next move.

After the first game had ended in a draw, Kramnik, playing Black, was generally considered in a comfortable position in Game 2, and he thought so himself apparently, as he refused a [[Draw (chess)|draw]] by avoiding a potential [[threefold repetition]] on 29...Qa7. Kramnik's troubles began when he decided to play for a win and pushed his a-pawn, 31...a4. Commentators, including American [[International Grandmaster|grandmaster]] [[Yasser Seirawan]], voiced concerns about Kramnik's intentions and the situation became more uncertain as the game went on with 32.Nxe6 Bxe3+ 33.Kh1 Bxc1 34.Nxf8, turning it into a likely draw.<ref>{{cite news |title=Late game blunder costs Kramnik in loss to Deep Fritz chess software |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/27/europe/EU_GEN_Germany_Chess.php |newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] |date=27 November 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061201060813/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/27/europe/EU_GEN_Germany_Chess.php |archivedate=2006-12-01}}</ref> The game could have ended with 34...Kg8 35.Ng6 Bxb2 36.Qd5+ Kh7 37.Nf8+ Kh8 38.Ng6+.\n\nHowever Kramnik's next move, '''34...

(a move which was awarded \"???\" originally by ChessBase on a story covering Kramnik's blunder, and even \"??????\" by [[Susan Polgar]]), came as a big surprise and was described as possibly the \"blunder of the century\" and perhaps the \"biggest blunder ever\" by Susan Polgar, as Kramnik overlooked a mate in one.<ref>[http://susanpolgar.blogspot.com/2006/11/blunder-of-century-biggest-blunder.html Blunder of the century], blog by Susan Polgar, 27 November 2006</ref> Deep Fritz immediately ended the game with 35.Qh7#, [[checkmate]]. Seirawan later called Kramnik's move \"a tragedy\".\n\n''[[ChessBase]]'' described the events as follows: \"Kramnik played the move 34...Qe3 calmly, stood up, picked up his cup and was about to leave the stage to go to his rest room. At least one audio commentator also noticed nothing, while Fritz operator [[Mathias Feist]] kept glancing from the board to the screen and back, hardly able to believe that he had input the correct move. Fritz was displaying mate in one, and when Mathias executed it on the board Kramnik briefly grasped his forehead, took a seat to sign the score sheet and left for the press conference, which he dutifully attended.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chessbase.com/newsdetail.asp?newsid=3509|title=Man vs machine shocker: Kramnik allows mate in one|work=Chess News|accessdate=14 April 2016}}</ref> During it he stated that he had planned the supposedly winning move 34...Qe3 already when playing 29...Qa7, and had rechecked the line after each subsequent move.

It is usually caused by some tactical oversight, whether from [[time trouble]], overconfidence or carelessness. While a blunder may seem like a stroke of luck for the opposing player, some chess players give their opponent plenty of opportunities to blunder.\n\nWhat qualifies as a \"blunder\" rather than a normal mistake is somewhat subjective. A weak move from a novice player might be explained by the player's lack of skill, while the same move from a master might be called a blunder. In [[punctuation (chess)|chess annotation]], blunders are typically marked with a double question mark, \"{{chesspunc|??}}\", after the move.\n\nEspecially among amateur and novice players, blunders often occur because of a faulty thought process where they do not consider the opponent's {{chessgloss|forcing moves}}. In particular, [[Check (chess)|checks]], {{chessgloss|captures}}, and {{chessgloss|threats}} need to be considered at each move. Neglecting these possibilities leaves a player vulnerable to simple tactical errors.<ref>The principle of looking for checks, captures, and threats is repeated often by [[Dan Heisman]], see e.g. {{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/heisman14.pdf|title=A Generic Thought Process|last=Heisman|first=Dan|date=March 2002|publisher=The Chess Cafe|accessdate=2 August 2010}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.chesscafe.com/text/heisman65.pdf|title=Is It Safe?|last=Heisman|first=Dan|date=June 2006|publisher=The Chess Cafe|accessdate=2 August 2010}}</ref>\n\nOne technique formerly recommended to avoid blunders was to write down the planned move on the {{chessgloss|score sheet}}, then take one last look before making it.<ref>\"When you have finished analyzing all the variations and gone along all the branches of the tree of analysis you must first of all write the move down on your score sheet, before you play it.\" [[Alexander Kotov]], ''Think Like a Grandmaster'', Chess Digest, 1971, pp. 73\u201374.</ref><ref>[[Simon Webb (chess player)|Simon Webb]], ''Chess for Tigers'' (3rd ed. 2005), pp. 121\u201322.</ref> This practice was not uncommon even at the [[grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] level.<ref>Webb wrote of the practice, \"You've seen other players doing it\".

In the diagram position, Chandler is completely winning. His opponent, [[Susan Polgar]], played the wily trap 53...Ng8\u2013h6{{chesspunc|!?}}. Chandler realized that after 54.gxh6+ Kxh6 he will be left with the considerable {{chessgloss|material}} advantage of a {{chessgloss|rook pawn}} and [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] against a [[bare king]]. However, since the bishop is unable to control the [[promotion (chess)|promotion]] square h8, Black will draw if she is able to get her king to control h8 due to the [[wrong rook pawn]] [[fortress (chess)|fortress]]. But Chandler calculates further, and realizes that it is ''he'' who will win control over the h8 square after 55.Kf6, and thereby win the game.<ref>[[Andrew Soltis]], ''Chess to Enjoy'' in September 1997 ''[[Chess Life]]''</ref>\n\nTherefore, Chandler played '''54. gxh6+??''', but instead of the expected 54...Kxh6 came 54...Kh8! This is in fact almost the same king, bishop, and rook pawn versus bare king situation as Chandler had calculated that he would avoid, and the small difference that White has ''two'' rook pawns rather than one has no effect on the result.

Carlsen adopted the space-gaining [[Mar\u00f3czy Bind]] setup against the Kan Variation of the [[Sicilian Defence]], and accepted a set of isolated [[doubled pawns]] in return for active play. After an early queen exchange he soon developed a commanding position and appeared to have excellent winning chances. On his 26th move Carlsen played '''26.

(with a [[discovered attack]] on the g4-rook) 27.Rxg8 Nxc4+ ([[zwischenzug]]) 28.Kd3 Nb2+ 29.Ke2 Rxg8 leads to Black picking up 2 extra pawns and gaining excellent winning chances. Anand, not expecting the blunder, replied with '''26... a4??''' in less than a minute. He, too, saw the missed tactic immediately after making his move.

Bwabwata is situated in the Caprivi and Kavango regions, extending along the Caprivi Strip. It is bounded by the [[Okavango River]] to the west and the Kwando River to the east. Angola lies to the north and Botswana to the south.\n\nThe main road between the towns of [[Rundu]] and [[Katima Mulilo]], the [[Trans-Caprivi Highway]] ([[B8 road (Namibia)|B8]]), runs through Bwabwata, linking Namibia to Botswana, [[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. A minor road (C48) dissects Mahango in a north-south direction and connects Namibia to Botswana.\n\nAt either end of the Park are small settlements \u2013 [[Kongola]] in the east and [[Divundu]] in the west. \n\nThe park is largely unfenced but the southern boundary with Botswana has three veterinary standard fences. These prevent the spread of cattle diseases, such as [[Foot-and-mouth disease]].\n\n== Biology and ecology ==\nBwabwata is located in the Tree and Shrub [[Savanna]] biome. Vegetation types include North-eastern Kalahari Woodland, Caprivi Mopane Woodland, Riverine Woodlands and Islands, Okavango Valley, Caprivi Floodplains. The landscape consists of low vegetated sand dunes with old drainage lines ([[Omuramba|''Omiramba'']]) in between. \n\nBwabwata forms a crucial trans-boundary link for wildlife movement between Angola, Botswana, Namibia and Zambia.\n\n=== Flora ===\nTypical trees include Zambezi teak (''[[Baikiaea plurijuga]]''), wild seringa (''[[Burkea africana]]''), African teak (''[[Pterocarpus angolensis]]''), manketti (''Schinziophyton rautanenii''), false mopane (''[[Guibourtia coleosperma]]''), camelthorn tree (''[[Acacia erioloba]]''), jackalberry (''[[Diospyros mespiliformis]]'') and makalani palm (''[[Hyphaene petersiana]]'').<ref>Mannheimer, CA and Curtis, BA (eds) 2009. \"Le Roux and Muller Field Guide to the Trees and Shrubs of Namibia\". Windhoek: Macmillan Education Namibia</ref>\n\n=== Fauna ===\nSeveral rare large mammal and bird species are found in Bwabwata. Elephants regularly move between Namibia, Angola, Botswana and Zambia. Other species found are [[African buffalo|Cape buffalo]], [[hippopotamus]], [[roan antelope]], [[sable antelope]], [[tsessebe]], [[Chapman's zebra|zebra]], [[blue wildebeest|wildebeest]], [[common reedbuck]], [[red lechwe]], [[sitatunga]] and [[Nile crocodile|crocodile]]. Main predators are [[Panthera leo melanochaita|lion]], [[African leopard|leopard]], [[South African cheetah|cheetah]] and [[spotted hyena]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.met.gov.na/Documents/Bwabwata%20National%20Park.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228045914/http://www.met.gov.na/Documents/Bwabwata%20National%20Park.pdf# |archive-date=2013-12-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \n\nThe Mahango Area and Kavango River in western Bwabwata are listed as an internationally [[Important Bird Area]] supporting globally threatened species and is an avian diversity hotspot.

Although fires are a natural phenomenon in these savannas, too frequent or infrequent fires may negatively affect vegetation and fauna. A managed burning programme aims to reduce the frequency and intensity of fires.\n\n== Recreation ==\nVisitors travelling off the main road need a permit and must drive only on designated roads. Several sandy roads, suitable for all-wheel drive vehicles, are found near the Kwando and Okavango rivers.\n \nBwabwata has three community-operated campsites within the park, namely N\u01c1goabaca, Nambwa and Bum Hill. Local communities, organised into communal area conservancies, earn revenue from these campsites. Several lodges are situated outside Bwabwata on its borders. Tour operators offer game drives, boat trips and walks in the Park.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.met.gov.na/Directorates/Parks/Documents/BMM%20Parks%20Tourism%20Development%20Plan%20-%20Final.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123153143/http://www.met.gov.na/Directorates/Parks/Documents/BMM%20Parks%20Tourism%20Development%20Plan%20-%20Final.pdf# |archive-date=2014-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Kavango\u2013Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area==\nAngola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe have agreed to manage trans-boundary conservation through the [[Kavango\u2013Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area]] (KaZa TFCA). Bwabwata is situated in the centre of the KaZa TFCA and forms a corridor for elephant movement from Botswana into Angola and Zambia.\n\n== Park management ==\nTo accommodate Bwabwata\u2019s resident people, the Namibian Government has adopted integrated park management. The park is zoned into core areas for conservation and farming. Three areas are designated for special protection and controlled tourism \u2013 Kwando ({{Convert|1345|km2}}), Buffalo ({{Convert|629|km2}}), and Mahango ({{Convert|245|km2}}). A large Multiple Use Area ({{Convert|4055|km2}}) is zoned for community-based tourism, trophy hunting, human settlement and farming.\n \nPark residents are mostly from the Khwe [[San people|San]] bushmen minority group. Most residents live in [[Omega, Namibia|Omega]] village in the central part of the park and several smaller settlements. Residents have formed the Kyaramacan Association to represent them. Kyaramacan manages income from tourism (the N\u01c1goabaca campsite and a small lodge), from trophy hunting and the sale of devil\u2019s claw (''[[Harpagophytum procumbens]]''), a plant sold internationally to reduce pain and fever. \n\nThe Namibian Government, through the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, works with local communities to manage Bwabwata National Park. A technical committee, consisting of representatives from other Government departments, conservancies, community forests and non-governmental organisations, advises the Minister of Environment and Tourism. Community game guards work with the Ministry of Environment and Tourism staff to prevent poaching.<ref>Ministry of Environment and Tourism, Namibia. Bwabwata management plan (draft) 2011</ref>\n\n== Park development ==\nBwabwata is one of five national parks in north-eastern Namibia. It is managed as a unit with Mangetti, [[Khaudom National Park]], [[Mudumu National Park]] and Nkasa Rupara (formerly [[Mamili National Park]]).\n\nSince 2006, the ''NamParks'' Project (formerly BMM Parks Project), co-funded by the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] through [[KfW]] has helped develop management and tourism plans and constructed new park offices and staff housing in Namibia\u2019s north-eastern parks, including Bwabwata. The Project has helped introduce park-friendly land-uses in the surrounding areas and collaborative management structures.\nManagement priorities include the conservation of important habitats, safeguarding corridors for regional wildlife migration; providing income for rural residents and developing tourism.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.met.gov.na/Directorates/Parks/Pages/BwabwataMudumu-Mamiliproject.aspx# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119220738/http://www.met.gov.na/Directorates/Parks/Pages/BwabwataMudumu-Mamiliproject.aspx# |archive-date=2014-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |title=Bwabwata National Park \n |publisher=Republic of Namibia - Ministry of Environment and Tourism \n |url=http://www.met.gov.na/Documents/Bwabwata%20Park%20Profile.pdf \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68CkgwakM?url=http://www.met.gov.na/Documents/Bwabwata%20Park%20Profile.pdf \n |archivedate=2012-06-05 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of national parks of Namibia]]\n* [[Caprivi Region]]\n* [[Caprivi game park]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.met.gov.na/national-parks/bwabwata-national-park/213/ Ministry of Wildlife, Forestry and Tourism] \n{{National Parks of Namibia}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:National parks of Namibia]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 2007]]\n[[Category:2007 establishments in Namibia]]\n[[Category:Zambezi Region]]\n[[Category:Kavango East]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox protected area\n| name = Bwabwata National Park\n| alt_name = \n| photo_alt = \n| photo_caption = \n| photo_width = \n| map = Namibia |relief=1\n| map_alt = \n| map_caption = Map of [[Namibia]]\n| map_width = \n| location = Northeast [[Namibia]]\n| nearest_town = Rundu, Katima Mulilo\n| coordinates = {{coords|-17.95|22.54|region:NA|notes=<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.protectedplanet.net/sites/Caprivi_game_park |title=Caprivi Game Park |work=protectedplanet.net |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120913143635/http://protectedplanet.net/sites/Caprivi_Game_Park |archivedate=2012-09-13 }}</ref>|display=inline, title}}\n| area = {{Convert|6274|km2|abbr=on}}\n| established = 2007\n| visitation_num = \n| visitation_year = \n| governing_body = [[Ministry of Environment and Tourism, Namibia]]\n| world_heritage_site = \n| url = \n| photo = Loxodonta africana MS 10093s.jpg\n}}\n\n'''Bwabwata National Park''' is a [[protected area]] in northeastern [[Namibia]] that was established in 2007 and covers {{Convert|6274|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

Main predators are [[Panthera leo melanochaita|lion]], [[African leopard|leopard]], [[South African cheetah|cheetah]] and [[spotted hyena]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.met.gov.na/Documents/Bwabwata%20National%20Park.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228045914/http://www.met.gov.na/Documents/Bwabwata%20National%20Park.pdf# |archive-date=2013-12-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \n\nThe Mahango Area and Kavango River in western Bwabwata are listed as an internationally [[Important Bird Area]] supporting globally threatened species and is an avian diversity hotspot. Species include [[black-winged pratincole]], [[slaty egret]], [[wattled crane]], [[African skimmer]], [[African pygmy-goose]], [[coppery-tailed coucal]], [[white-backed night heron]], [[rufous-bellied heron]], [[Allen's gallinule]], [[Dickinson's kestrel]],  [[black-faced babbler]], [[swamp boubou]], [[collared palm thrush]], [[Meves's starling]], [[southern ground hornbill]], [[barred owlet]], [[Bennett's woodpecker]], [[African wood owl|wood owl]], various [[warbler]]s and [[cisticola]]s.<ref>BirdLife International (2012) Important Bird Areas factsheet: Mahango Game Reserve and Kavango River.

Although fires are a natural phenomenon in these savannas, too frequent or infrequent fires may negatively affect vegetation and fauna. A managed burning programme aims to reduce the frequency and intensity of fires.\n\n== Recreation ==\nVisitors travelling off the main road need a permit and must drive only on designated roads. Several sandy roads, suitable for all-wheel drive vehicles, are found near the Kwando and Okavango rivers.\n \nBwabwata has three community-operated campsites within the park, namely N\u01c1goabaca, Nambwa and Bum Hill. Local communities, organised into communal area conservancies, earn revenue from these campsites. Several lodges are situated outside Bwabwata on its borders. Tour operators offer game drives, boat trips and walks in the Park.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.met.gov.na/Directorates/Parks/Documents/BMM%20Parks%20Tourism%20Development%20Plan%20-%20Final.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140123153143/http://www.met.gov.na/Directorates/Parks/Documents/BMM%20Parks%20Tourism%20Development%20Plan%20-%20Final.pdf# |archive-date=2014-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Kavango\u2013Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area==\nAngola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe have agreed to manage trans-boundary conservation through the [[Kavango\u2013Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area]] (KaZa TFCA). Bwabwata is situated in the centre of the KaZa TFCA and forms a corridor for elephant movement from Botswana into Angola and Zambia.\n\n== Park management ==\nTo accommodate Bwabwata\u2019s resident people, the Namibian Government has adopted integrated park management. The park is zoned into core areas for conservation and farming. Three areas are designated for special protection and controlled tourism \u2013 Kwando ({{Convert|1345|km2}}), Buffalo ({{Convert|629|km2}}), and Mahango ({{Convert|245|km2}}). A large Multiple Use Area ({{Convert|4055|km2}}) is zoned for community-based tourism, trophy hunting, human settlement and farming.\n \nPark residents are mostly from the Khwe [[San people|San]] bushmen minority group. Most residents live in [[Omega, Namibia|Omega]] village in the central part of the park and several smaller settlements. Residents have formed the Kyaramacan Association to represent them. Kyaramacan manages income from tourism (the N\u01c1goabaca campsite and a small lodge), from trophy hunting and the sale of devil\u2019s claw (''[[Harpagophytum procumbens]]''), a plant sold internationally to reduce pain and fever. \n\nThe Namibian Government, through the Ministry of Environment and Tourism, works with local communities to manage Bwabwata National Park. A technical committee, consisting of representatives from other Government departments, conservancies, community forests and non-governmental organisations, advises the Minister of Environment and Tourism. Community game guards work with the Ministry of Environment and Tourism staff to prevent poaching.<ref>Ministry of Environment and Tourism, Namibia. Bwabwata management plan (draft) 2011</ref>\n\n== Park development ==\nBwabwata is one of five national parks in north-eastern Namibia. It is managed as a unit with Mangetti, [[Khaudom National Park]], [[Mudumu National Park]] and Nkasa Rupara (formerly [[Mamili National Park]]).\n\nSince 2006, the ''NamParks'' Project (formerly BMM Parks Project), co-funded by the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] through [[KfW]] has helped develop management and tourism plans and constructed new park offices and staff housing in Namibia\u2019s north-eastern parks, including Bwabwata. The Project has helped introduce park-friendly land-uses in the surrounding areas and collaborative management structures.\nManagement priorities include the conservation of important habitats, safeguarding corridors for regional wildlife migration; providing income for rural residents and developing tourism.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.met.gov.na/Directorates/Parks/Pages/BwabwataMudumu-Mamiliproject.aspx# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119220738/http://www.met.gov.na/Directorates/Parks/Pages/BwabwataMudumu-Mamiliproject.aspx# |archive-date=2014-01-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n |title=Bwabwata National Park \n |publisher=Republic of Namibia - Ministry of Environment and Tourism \n |url=http://www.met.gov.na/Documents/Bwabwata%20Park%20Profile.pdf \n |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68CkgwakM?url=http://www.met.gov.na/Documents/Bwabwata%20Park%20Profile.pdf \n |archivedate=2012-06-05 \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of national parks of Namibia]]\n* [[Caprivi Region]]\n* [[Caprivi game park]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.met.gov.na/national-parks/bwabwata-national-park/213/ Ministry of Wildlife, Forestry and Tourism] - [[Ministry of Environment, Forestry and Tourism]]\n{{National Parks of Namibia}}\n{{authority control}}\n[[Category:National parks of Namibia]]\n[[Category:Protected areas established in 2007]]\n[[Category:2007 establishments in Namibia]]\n[[Category:Zambezi Region]]\n[[Category:Kavango East]]\n", "name_user": "Stralitzia", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bwabwata_National_Park"}
{"title_page": "List of political parties in France", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Politics of France}}\n[[France]] has a [[multi-party system|multi-party political system]]: one in which the number of competing [[political party|political parties]] is sufficiently large as to make it almost inevitable that in order to participate in the exercise of power any single party must be prepared to negotiate with one or more others with a view to forming [[electoral alliance]]s and/or [[coalition]] agreements.\n\nThe dominant French political parties are also characterised by a noticeable degree of intra-party [[political faction|factionalism]], making each of them effectively a coalition in itself.\n\nUp until recently, the government of France had alternated between two rather stable [[coalition]]s:\n\n* on the [[centre-left]], one led by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and with minor partners such as [[Europe Ecology \u2013 The Greens]] and the [[Radical Party of the Left]].\n* on the [[centre-right]], one led by [[Les R\u00e9publicains|The Republicans]] (and previously its predecessors, the [[Union for a Popular Movement]], [[Rally for the Republic]]) and the [[Union of Democrats and Independents]].\nThis was the case until the [[2017 French presidential election|2017 presidential election]], when [[Emmanuel Macron]] of liberal [[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!]] defeated [[Marine Le Pen]] of right-wing [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]] in the second round. This was the first time in which a third party had won the presidency, as well as the first time that neither of the major coalitions had appeared in the second round of a presidential election. This was followed shortly by a significant victory for LREM in the [[2017 French legislative election|2017 legislative election]], winning a majority of 350 seats. Both the traditional coalitions suffered major defeats.\n\nNational Rally (previously known as the National Front before a name change in 2018) has also experienced significant successes in other elections. Since 2014, the party has established itself as the third sizable party, finishing in first place in the [[2014 European Parliament election in France|2014]] and [[2019 European Parliament election in France|2019 European elections]] as well as in the 2015 local elections<ref>{{cite

"{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Politics of France}}\n[[France]] has a [[multi-party system|multi-party political system]]: one in which the number of competing [[political party|political parties]] is sufficiently large as to make it almost inevitable that in order to participate in the exercise of power any single party must be prepared to negotiate with one or more others with a view to forming [[electoral alliance]]s and/or [[coalition]] agreements.\n\nThe dominant French political parties are also characterised by a noticeable degree of intra-party [[political faction|factionalism]], making each of them effectively a coalition in itself.\n\nUp until recently, the government of France had alternated between two rather stable [[coalition]]s:\n\n* on the [[centre-left]], one led by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] and with minor partners such as [[Europe Ecology \u2013 The Greens]] and the [[Radical Party of the Left]].\n* on the [[centre-right]], one led by [[Les R\u00e9publicains|The Republicans]] (and previously its predecessors, the [[Union for a Popular Movement]], [[Rally for the Republic]]) and the [[Union of Democrats and Independents]].\nThis was the case until the [[2017 French presidential election|2017 presidential election]], when [[Emmanuel Macron]] of liberal [[La R\u00e9publique En Marche!]] defeated [[Marine Le Pen]] of right-wing [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]] in the second round. This was the first time in which a third party had won the presidency, as well as the first time that neither of the major coalitions had appeared in the second round of a presidential election. This was followed shortly by a significant victory for LREM in the [[2017 French legislative election|2017 legislative election]], winning a majority of 350 seats. Both the traditional coalitions suffered major defeats.\n\nNational Rally (previously known as the National Front before a name change in 2018) has also experienced significant successes in other elections. Since 2014, the party has established itself as the third sizable party, finishing in first place in the [[2014 European Parliament election in France|2014]] and [[2019 European Parliament election in France|2019 European elections]] as well as in the 2015 local elections<ref>{{cite

It superseded the post-[[World War II]] provisional [[Small Constitution of 1947]], which in turn replaced the pre-war [[April Constitution of Poland|April Constitution]] of 1935. \n\nThe 1952 constitution introduced a new name for the Polish state, the [[Polish People's Republic]] (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'', PRL), replacing the previously used Republic of Poland (''Rzeczpospolita Polska''). The communist-led ''[[Sejm]]'' ([[legislature]]) was declared to be the highest state authority. The real source of supreme state power, the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR), was not regulated by the constitution; it was ruled by its own statute. The constitution legalized many practices that had been introduced in Poland, in the wake of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the [[Polish People's Army]] defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1944\u20131945, by Polish-communist governmental bodies, including the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] (PKWN) and its successors.\n\nInstead of the traditional [[separation of powers]], the constitution introduced the Soviet concept of \"unity of the state's power\".<ref name=\"Cieplak\">{{Cite book|author=Cieplak, Tadeusz N. |chapter=Section 4.
