For example, the following data satisfy the parallel condition. In parallel data, even if a correlation matrix is used instead of a covariance matrix, there is no loss of information. All parallel data are also tau-equivalent, but the reverse is not true.

For example, the following data satisfies the condition of being tau-equivalent. All items in tau-equivalent data have equal discrimination or importance.

Conventional names give no information about the nature of each coefficient, or give misleading information (e.g., composite reliability). Conventional names are inconsistent. Some are formulas, and others are coefficients. Some are named after the original developer, some are named after someone who is not the original developer, and others do not include the name of any person. While one formula is referred to by multiple names, multiple formulas are referred to by one notation (e.g., alphas and omegas). The proposed systematic names and their notation for these reliability coefficients are as follows: <ref name = Cho/>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Systematic names of reliability coefficients\n|-\n!  !!

However, this interpretation overlooks the fact that <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> underestimes reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. At the population level, the maximum of all possible <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> values is closer to reliability than the average of all possible <math>\\rho_{ST}</math> values.<ref name=ChoKim/> This mathematical fact was already known even before the publication of Cronbach (1951).<ref name=Guttman>Guttman, L.

They did not give the reliability coefficients particular names. Equation 20 in their article is <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. This formula is often referred to as Kuder-Richardson Formula 20, or KR-20. They dealt with cases where the observed scores were dichotomous (e.g., correct or incorrect), so the expression of KR-20 is slightly different from the conventional formula of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. A review of this paper reveals that they did not present a general formula because they did not need to, not because they were not able to. Let <math>p_i</math> denote the correct answer ratio of item <math>i </math>, and <math>q_i</math> denote the incorrect answer ratio of item <math>i</math> (<math>p_i + q_i = 1 </math>).

He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated the unidimensionality of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

Psychometrika, 32(1), 1\u201313. https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02289400</ref> proved the necessary and sufficient condition for <math>\\rho_{T}</math> to be equal to reliability, and named it the condition of being essentially tau-equivalent.\n\nCronbach (1978)<ref name = c1978/> mentioned that the reason Cronbach (1951) received a lot of citations was \"mostly because [he] put a brand name on a common-place coefficient\"(p.263)<ref name = Cho />. He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math> \\rho_{T}=-3 </math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>-1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>-1</math> || <math>-1</math> || <math>1</math>\n|}\nNegative <math>\\rho_{T}</math> can occur for reasons such as negative discrimination or mistakes in processing reversely scored items.\n\nUnlike <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., <math>\\rho_{C}</math>) are always greater than or equal to zero.\n\n=== If there is no measurement error, the value of tau-equivalent reliability is one===\nThis anomaly also originates from the fact that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> underestimates reliability. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two. The covariance matrix between items is as follows, <math>\\rho_{T}=.9375</math>.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>X_3</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>1</math>||<math>1</math>||<math>1</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>1</math> || <math>1</math>|| <math>2</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_3</math>\n| <math>2</math> || <math>2</math> || <math>4</math>\n|}\nFor the above data, both <math>\\rho_{P}</math> and <math>\\rho_{C}</math> have a value of one.\n===A high value of tau-equivalent reliability indicates homogeneity between the items===\nMany textbooks refer to <math>\\rho_{T}</math> as an indicator of homogeneity between items. This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality. Several studies have provided proofs or counterexamples that high <math> \\rho_{T}</math> values do not indicate unidimensionality.<ref name=Cortina>Cortina, J. M. (1993). What is coefficient alpha?

The term is sometimes used to refer to a certain kind of reliability (e.g., internal consistency reliability), but it is unclear exactly which reliability coefficients are included here, in addition to <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach/> used the term in several senses without an explicit definition. Cho and Kim (2015)<ref name = ChoKim/> showed that <math> \\rho_{T}</math> is not an indicator of any of these.\n===Removing items using \"alpha if item deleted\" always increases reliability===\nRemoving an item using \"alpha if item deleted\" may result in 'alpha inflation,' where sample-level reliability is reported to be higher than population-level reliability.<ref name=KL>Kopalle, P.

It is also recommended that the whole sample be divided into two and cross-validated.<ref name=KL/>\n\n== Ideal reliability level and how to increase reliability ==\n=== Nunnally's recommendations for the level of reliability===\nThe most frequently cited source of how much reliability coefficients should be is Nunnally's book.<ref name=n1>Nunnally, J. C. (1967). Psychometric theory. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n2>Nunnally, J. C. (1978). Psychometric theory (2nd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref><ref name=n3>Nunnally, J. C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not. Rather than .7, the criterion of .8 referred to applied research by Nunnally is more appropriate for most empirical studies.<ref name=LBM/>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\n|+ Nunnally's recommendations on the level of reliability\n|-\n!   !! 1st edition<ref name=n1/> !! 2nd<ref name=n2/> & 3rd<ref name=n3/> edition\n|-\n| Early stage of research|| .5 or .6 || .7\n|-\n| Applied research|| .8 || .8\n|-\n| When making important decisions || .95 (minimum .9) || .95 (minimum .9)\n|}\n\nHis recommendation level did not imply a cutoff point. If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 51(5), 493\u2013504. https://doi.org/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1954.tb00485.x</ref><ref>Humphreys, L. (1956). The normal curve and the attenuation paradox in test theory. Psychological Bulletin, 53(6), 472\u2013476. https://doi.org/10.1037/h0041091</ref>\n\nA high value of reliability can be in conflict with content validity. For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991). Does item homogeneity indicate internal consistency or item redundancy in psychometric scales?

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest. Discover in advance the problem of reliability.\n\nExclude or modify items that are different in content or form from other items (e.g., reversely scored items).\n====After data collection====\nRemove the problematic items using \"alpha if item deleted\". However, this deletion should be accompanied by a theoretical rationale.\n\nUse a more accurate reliability coefficient than <math>\\rho_{T}</math>.

To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software.

The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items.

Hoyt<ref name = Hoyt/> explained that his method \"gives precisely the same result\" as KR-20 (p.156). Jackson and Ferguson<ref name = JF/> stated that the two formulas are \"identical\"(p.74). Guttman<ref name = Guttman/> said <math> \\lambda_3 </math> is \"algebraically identical\" to KR-20 (p.275). Gulliksen<ref name = Gulliksen/> also admitted that the two formulas are \u201cidentical\u201d(p.224). \n\nEven studies critical of KR-20 did not point out that the original formula of KR-20 could only be applied to dichotomous data.<ref name=c1943>Cronbach, L.

Hoyt<ref name=Hoyt2>Hoyt, C. J. (1941). Note on a simplified method of computing test reliability: Educational and Psychological Measurement, 1(1). https://doi.org/10.1177/001316444100100109</ref> argued that this characteristic alone made <math> \\rho_{T}</math> more recommendable than the traditional split-half technique, which was unknown whether to underestimate or overestimate reliability.\n\nCronbach (1943)<ref name =c1943/> was critical of the underestimation of <math> \\rho_{T} </math>. He was concerned that it was not known how much <math> \\rho_{T} </math> underestimated reliability. He criticized that the underestimation was likely to be excessively severe, such that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could sometimes lead to negative values.\nBecause of these problems, he argued that <math> \\rho_{T} </math> could not be recommended as an alternative to the split-half technique.\n=== Cronbach (1951) ===\nAs with previous studies<ref name = Hoyt /><ref name = Guttman /><ref name = JF /><ref name = Gulliksen />, Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> invented another method to derive <math>\\rho_{T} </math>. His interpretation was more intuitively attractive than those of previous studies. That is, he proved that <math> \\rho_ {T} </math> equals the average of <math> \\rho_{ST} </math> values obtained for all possible split-halves. He criticized that the name KR-20 was weird and suggested a new name, coefficient alpha. His approach has been a huge success. However, he not only omitted some key facts, but also gave an incorrect explanation.\n\nFirst, he positioned coefficient alpha as a general formula of KR-20, but omitted the explanation that existing studies had published the precisely identical formula. Those who read only Cronbach (1951) without background knowledge could misunderstand that he was the first to develop the general formula of KR-20. \n\nSecond, he did not explain under what condition <math>\\rho_{T}</math> equals reliability. Non-experts could misunderstand that <math>\\rho_{T}</math> was a general reliability coefficient that could be used for all data regardless of prerequisites. \n\nThird, he did not explain why he changed his attitude toward <math>\\rho_{T}</math>. In particular, he did not provide a clear answer to the underestimation problem of <math>\\rho_{T}</math>, which he himself<ref name = c1943 /> had criticized. \n\nFourth, he argued that a high value of <math>\\rho_{T}</math> indicated the unidimensionality of the data.\n\n===After 1951===\nNovick and Lewis (1967)<ref name = NL>Novick, M.

He explained that he had originally planned to name other types of reliability coefficients (e.g., inter-rater reliability or test-retest reliability) in consecutive Greek letter (e.g., <math>\\beta</math>, <math>\\gamma</math>, <math>\\ldots</math>), but later changed his mind.\n\nCronbach and Schavelson (2004)<ref name = c2004>Cronbach, L.

He opposed the use of the name Cronbach's alpha. He explicitly denied the existence of existing studies that had published the general formula of KR-20 prior to Cronbach (1951).\n\n== Common misconceptions about tau-equivalent reliability<ref name=ChoKim/>==\n===The value of tau-equivalent reliability ranges between zero and one===\nBy definition, reliability cannot be less than zero and cannot be greater than one. Many textbooks mistakenly equate <math> \\rho_{T}</math> with reliability and give an inaccurate explanation of its range. <math>\\rho_{T}</math> is less than reliability when applied to data that are not tau-equivalent. Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by -1.

Suppose that <math>X_2</math> copied the value of <math>X_1</math> as it is, and <math>X_3</math> copied by multiplying the value of <math>X_1</math> by two.

This misconception stems from the inaccurate explanation of Cronbach (1951)<ref name = Cronbach /> that high <math>\\rho_{T}</math> values show homogeneity between the items. Homogeneity is a term that is rarely used in the modern literature, and related studies interpret the term as referring to unidimensionality.

C., & Bernstein, I. H. (1994). Psychometric theory (3rd ed.). New York, NY: McGraw-Hill.</ref> However, his recommendations are cited contrary to his intentions. What he meant was to apply different criteria depending on the purpose or stage of the study. However, regardless of the nature of the research, such as exploratory research, applied research, and scale development research, a criterion of .7 is universally used<ref name=LBM>Lance, C. E., Butts, M. M., & Michels, L. C. (2006). What did they really say? Organizational Research Methods, 9(2), 202\u2013220. https://doi.org/10.1177/1094428105284919</ref>. .7 is the criterion he recommended for the early stages of a study, which most studies published in the journal are not.

If a criterion means a cutoff point, it is important whether or not it is met, but it is unimportant how much it is over or under. He did not mean that it should be strictly .8 when referring to the criteria of .8. If the reliability has a value near .8 (e.g., 78), it can be considered that his recommendation has been met.<ref name = c2020>Cho, E. (2020). A comprehensive review of so-called Cronbach's alpha. Journal of Product Research, 38(1), 9\u201320.</ref>\n\nHis idea was that there is a cost to increasing reliability, so there is no need to try to obtain maximum reliability in every situation.\n\n===Cost to obtain a high level of reliability===\nMany textbooks explain that the higher the value of reliability, the better. The potential side effects of high reliability are rarely discussed. However, the principle of sacrificing something to get one also applies to reliability.\n====Trade-off between reliability and validity<ref name = ChoKim/>====\nMeasurements with perfect reliability lack validity. For example, a person who take the test with the reliability of one will get a perfect score or a zero score, because the examinee who give the correct answer or incorrect answer on one item will give the correct answer or incorrect answer on all other items. The phenomenon in which validity is sacrificed to increase reliability is called attenuation paradox.<ref>Loevinger, J. (1954). The attenuation paradox in test theory.

For high content validity, each item should be constructed to be able to comprehensively represent the content to be measured. However, a strategy of repeatedly measuring essentially the same question in different ways is often used only for the purpose of increasing reliability.<ref>Boyle, G. J. (1991).

However, the increase in the number of items hinders the efficiency of measurements.\n===Methods to increase reliability ===\nDespite the costs associated with increasing reliability discussed above, a high level of reliability may be required. The following methods can be considered to increase reliability.\n====Before data collection====\nEliminate the ambiguity of the measurement item.\n\nDo not measure what the respondents do not know.\n\nIncrease the number of items. However, care should be taken not to excessively inhibit the efficiency of the measurement.\n\nUse a scale that is known to be highly reliable.<ref>Lee, H. (2017). Research Methodology (2nd ed.), Hakhyunsa.</ref>\n\nConduct a pretest.

However, different opinions are given on which reliability coefficient should be used instead of <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>.\n\nDifferent reliability coefficients ranked first in each simulation study<ref name=KTD/><ref name=Osburn/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=TC/><ref name=VVS/> comparing the accuracy of several reliability coefficients.<ref name=ChoKim/>\n\nThe majority opinion is to use SEM-based reliability coefficients as an alternative to <math> {\\rho} _ {T} </math>.<ref name=Cho/><ref name=ChoKim/><ref name=DBB/><ref name=GY/><ref name=Peters/><ref name=RM/><ref name=RZ/><ref name=YG/>\n\nHowever, there is no consensus on which of the several SEM-based reliability coefficients (e.g., unidimensional or multidimensional models) is the best to use.\n\nSome people say <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math><ref name=RZ/> as an alternative, but <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> shows information that is completely different from reliability. <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> is a type of coefficient comparable to Revelle's <math>\\beta</math>.<ref name=Revelle/><ref name=RZ/> They do not substitute, but complement reliability.<ref name=Cho/>\n\nAmong SEM-based reliability coefficients, multidimensional reliability coefficients are rarely used, and the most commonly used is <math>{\\rho}_{C}</math> .<ref name = Cho/>\n===Software for SEM-based reliability coefficients===\nGeneral-purpose statistical software such as SPSS and SAS include a function to calculate <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math>. Users who don't understand the formula of <math> {\\rho}_{T}</math> have no problem in obtaining the estimates with just a few mouse clicks. \n\nSEM software such as AMOS, LISREL, and MPLUS does not have a function to calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients. Users need to calculate the result by inputting it to the formula. To avoid this inconvenience and possible error, even studies reporting the use of SEM rely on <math>{\\rho}_{T}</math> instead of SEM-based reliability coefficients.<ref name = Cho/> There are a few alternatives to automatically calculate SEM-based reliability coefficients.\n\n1) R (free): The psych package <ref>http://personality-project.org/r/overview.pdf</ref> calculates various reliability coefficients.\n\n2) EQS (paid)<ref>http://www.mvsoft.com/eqs60.htm</ref>: This SEM software has a function to calculate reliability coefficients.\n\n3) RelCalc (free)<ref name = Cho/>: Available with Microsoft Excel. <Math>\\rho_C</math> can be obtained without the need for SEM software. Various multidimensional SEM reliability coefficients and various types of <math>{\\omega}_{H}</math> can be calculated based on the results of SEM software.\n\n==Derivation of formula<ref name=Cho/>==\nAssumption 1. The observed score of an item consists of the true score of the item and the error of the item, which is independent of the true score. <math>X_i=T_i+e_i</math>\n\nLemma. <math>Cov(T_i,e_i)=Cov(T_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 2. Errors are independent of each other. <math>Cov(e_i,e_j)=0, \\forall i \\ne j</math>\n\nAssumption 3. (The assumption of being essentially tau-equivalent) The true score of an item consists of the true score common to all items and the constant of the item. <math>T_i=\\mu_i + t</math>\n\nLet <math>T</math> denote the sum of the item true scores. <math>T=\\sum_{i=1}^k T_i</math>\n\nThe variance of <math>T</math> is called the true score variance.\n\nDefinition. Reliability is the ratio of true score variance to observed score variance. <math>\\rho={\\sigma^2_T \\over \\sigma^2_X}</math>\n\nThe following relationship is established from the above assumptions.\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_i=Var(\\mu_i + t+e_i)=\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_i} (\\because Var(\\mu_i)=Cov(t,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,e_i)=Cov(\\mu_i,t)=0)</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma_{ij}=Cov(T_i+e_i, T_j+e_j)=\\sigma^2_t (\\because Cov(T_i,e_j)=Cov(T_j,e_i)=Cov(e_i,e_j)=0)</math>\n\nTherefore, the covariance matrix between items is as follows.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Observed covariance matrix\n|-\n!\n! <math>X_1</math>\n! <math>X_2</math>\n! <math>\\ldots</math>\n! <math>X_k</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_1</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_1}</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>||<math>\\ldots</math>||<math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_2</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_2}</math>|| <math>\\ldots</math>|| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math>\n|-\n! <math>\\vdots</math>\n| <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\vdots</math> || <math>\\ddots</math>|| <math>\\vdots</math>\n|-\n! <math>X_k</math>\n| <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t</math> || <math>\\ldots</math> || <math>\\sigma^2_t+\\sigma^2 _{e_k}</math>\n|-\n\n|}\nYou can see that <math> \\sigma^2_t</math> equals the mean of the covariances between items. That is, <math>\\sigma^2_t=\\overline{\\sigma_{ij}}</math>\n\n<math>\\sigma^2_T=Var(\\sum_{i=1}^k t)=k^2 \\sigma^2_t = k^2 \\overline{\\sigma_{ij}} </math>\n\nLet <math> \\rho_T </math> denote the reliability when satisfying the above assumptions. <math> \\rho_T</math> is:\n\n</br><math>\\rho_T = {k^2 \\overline{\\sigma_{ij}} \\over \\sigma^2_X} </math>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.open.ac.uk/socialsciences/spsstutorial/files/tutorials/cronbachs-alpha.pdf Cronbach's alpha SPSS tutorial]\n* The free web interface and R package cocron [http://comparingcronbachalphas.org] allows to statistically compare two or more dependent or independent cronbach alpha coefficients.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cronbach's Alpha}}\n[[Category:Comparison of assessments]]\n[[Category:Psychometrics]]\n[[Category:Educational psychology research methods]]\n", "name_user": "Eunscho", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eConventional names", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronbach%27s_alpha"}

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20,000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found. Lee, Lim and Ho, who were the three people assaulting Ong right from the back of the car, were charged with the murder of the youth. The three were found guilty of murder and sentenced to death on 11 June 1970, and all the three men were hanged on 27 January 1973. Lai, who became the prosecution's main witness, was subsequently jailed for 4 years for his involvement in both the ransom negotiation and the abduction of Ong. For possessing the ransom money, Chow was also given a 4-year jail sentence as well.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep8/367512|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1970s==\n\n===1970===\n* 6 January 1970: 31-year-old dance hostess Mimi Wong Weng Siu (\u9ec4\u5a49\u79c0) and 37-year-old sweeper Sim Woh Kum (\u51bc\u677e\u9526) in late 1969 were convicted of murder of a Mrs Watanabe and sentenced to death on 7 December 1970.

During the robbery, when Harun went around the house to look for valuables to steal, Yasin was restraining the victim and tried to rape her. While he was trying to rape her, Yasin sat on Poon's chest, which led to fractures on her ribs, and these fractures led to Poon's death. The two men proceeded to dispose the body into the sea before returning to the mainland, but the body was unexpectedly fished out from the sea by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when he was arrested for theft, Harun surprised his interrogators by confessing to them about his involvement in the robbery. This confession led to Yasin's arrest, and the two men were charged with the murder of Poon Sai Imm. At the end of their trial in early 1974, Harun was found guilty of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Although Yasin's appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal, his appeal to the Privy Council in London was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act which results in death. However, Yasin was brought back to court again and promptly charged with rape. At the trial on 11 May 1977, Yasin denied raping the elderly woman despite the abundant forensic evidence presented by the prosecution and the testimony given by Harun (who became the prosecution's chief witness) against him. At the end of the trial on 12 May 1977, Yasin was found guilty of attempted rape and he was sentenced to serve another 8 years in prison. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep6/367508|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n* 18 September 1972: A 22-year-old seamstress Cheng Li Zhen was walking along [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] with her sister when she suddenly screamed and collapsed to the ground with blood oozing out from her chest.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. The late senior forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the state of decomposition, some body parts were missing and the injuries he found on the skull and ribs were not sufficient to cause death. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, the school bus driver even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his school bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh Laye Koh's appeal against his conviction was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995. This case was re-enacted in \"Whispers Of The Dead\", a Singaporean crime show which features the notable cases solved by Professor Chao, though some aspects of the case, as well as the identities of those involved were changed for dramatic purposes. <ref> {{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep5/377256|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}} </ref> <ref>{{cite news|title=Two murderers hanged|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/digitised/issue/straitstimes19950909-1&ved=2ahUKEwj3ur7H8PnoAhVCWX0KHbD-DtcQFjAAegQIAxAB&usg=AOvVaw1Q8UplYrrw-kIoFuel_4Uf|newspaper=The Straits Times|}}</ref>\n\n===1994===\n\n* 6 June 1994: Known as the Oriental Hotel Murder, 25-year-old Abdul Nasir bin Amer Hamsah and 32-year-old Abdul Rahman bin Arshad barged into the room shared by two Japanese tourists - Fujii Isae, 49 and Miyoko Takishita, 56. Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face as he held onto the wall to try to steady himself, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

Furious, the 26-year-old Malaysian stepped out of the car and went to find the man who hit his car, but he could only find the man's companion. The other man did not seemed to respond to Tan's furious words and continued walking (this seemingly deliberate and apparent indifference only infuriated Tan further) until Tan caught his attention and made him turn around. Tan angrily asked the man, demanding to know why his friend hit his car window. But the man did not respond, and he pushed Tan down onto the ground before making his way. Provoked by this action, Tan picked up a stick he saw next to him from the ground and used it to hit the man once on the head and hit him many times (mostly on the man's haversack) even when the man has collapsed due to loss of consciousness. Tan only stopped after the man stopped moving and left for Malaysia in his car, with the belief that the man was still alive (as he could still hear him breathing before he left). Unknown to Tan, the first blow he inflicted on the man's head turned out to be fatal, and the victim, 44-year-old Krishnan Sengal Rajah, died as a result. What was more shocking to Tan was when he received news of the man's death, he found out that Krishnan was a deaf-mute, which explained why he did not seem to respond to Tan or seem to ignore his words. 10 months later, Tan Chun Seng was arrested in April 2002 in Malaysia, and he was charged with the murder of Krishnan. At the trial in early 2003, Tan failed to substantiate his defence of sudden and grave provocation against the murder charge and he was sentenced to death for murdering Krishnan. Tan filed an appeal against the sentence, and veteran lawyer Subhas Anandan, who represented Tan in his appeal, raised the huge disparity in terms of height and size between Tan and the apparently larger-sized and taller victim; the heat of the moment where the victim had started a brief sudden fight with Tan by pushing Tan onto the ground, leading to Tan picking up the stick in an uncontrollable fit of anger to hit the victim; the lack of any undue advantage Tan had against the victim, as well as other factors vital to Tan in his defence of a sudden fight against the murder charge. After hearing the appeal, on 20 May 2003, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, amending the murder conviction to one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and sentenced Tan to 10 years' imprisonment. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s4/ep7/367568|title=True Files S4|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n*10 August 2001: A day before the wedding of 33-year-old businessman Tay Teng Joo, he was kidnapped by 45-year-old Chng Teo Heng together with the assistance of his accomplices, 52-year-old businesswoman Agnes Ng Lei Eng and 42-year-old freelance painter Ng Soon Teck.

Later on, Ong's father received two separate phone calls on 26 May and 5 June in which the caller claimed he had kidnapped Ong and demanded a ransom from Ong's father to free his son. A ransom of $20,000 was eventually negotiated and paid, but still, there was no sign of Ong. A week after the ransom was paid, a rental car owner found one of the cars he rented out three weeks before had a foul-smelling odour. Tests revealed that the smell was that of blood. The person who last rented the car was found to be 24-year-old Richard Lai Chun Seng. Lai confessed that he, along with four others, was part of a kidnapping, in which the victim was none other than the missing youth Ong Beang Leck. Lai also stated that he took part in the plan as he needed money to save his failing business, and that he thought the plan was to lure Ong into the rental car, render the youth unconscious and held him hostage until the ransom was paid; however, on the night of 24 June 1968, as soon as Ong entered the car, Lai was shocked to see the three of his four other accomplices taking out weapons he was unaware of and attacked Ong, which led to the boy's death. This relevation led to the arrest of the other four accomplices; one of them was Ong's 24-year-old close friend Lee Chor Pet, the others were 29-year-old Chow Sien Cheong, 32-year-old Lim Kim Kwee, and 23-year-old Ho Kee Fatt (the latter two had ran off to Malaysia before their arrest by the Royal Malaysian Police). Lee led the police to a manhole in Jurong, where Ong's highly decomposed body was found.

During the robbery, when Harun went around the house to look for valuables to steal, Yasin was restraining the victim and tried to rape her. While he was trying to rape her, Yasin sat on Poon's chest, which led to fractures on her ribs, and these fractures led to Poon's death. The two men proceeded to dispose the body into the sea before returning to the mainland, but the body was unexpectedly fished out from the sea by a fisherman the following morning. 9 months later, when he was arrested for theft, Harun surprised his interrogators by confessing to them about his involvement in the robbery. This confession led to Yasin's arrest, and the two men were charged with the murder of Poon Sai Imm. At the end of their trial in early 1974, Harun was found guilty of robbery by night and sentenced to 12 years' jail and 12 strokes of the cane, while Yasin was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death. Although Yasin's appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal, his appeal to the Privy Council in London was accepted and he was sentenced to 2 years' jail for committing a rash/negligient act which results in death. However, Yasin was brought back to court again and promptly charged with rape. At the trial on 11 May 1977, Yasin denied raping the elderly woman despite the abundant forensic evidence presented by the prosecution and the testimony given by Harun (who became the prosecution's chief witness) against him. At the end of the trial on 12 May 1977, Yasin was found guilty of attempted rape and he was sentenced to serve another 8 years in prison. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep6/367508|title=True Files S3|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n* 18 September 1972: A 22-year-old seamstress Cheng Li Zhen was walking along [[Queenstown, Singapore|Queenstown]] with her sister when she suddenly screamed and collapsed to the ground with blood oozing out from her chest.

His body was suspected to be dismembered, cooked in curry, packed in plastic bags and disposed in rubbish bins along the roads. However, his remains and evidence of the murder were never found. His wife and her three brothers were charged in court in 1987 but released in the same year due to lack of evidence.

She suffered multiple stab wounds on her neck. Her body showed signs of a fierce but futile protest, probably made when she was trying to fight off her killer(s). An autopsy showed that she had been sexually assaulted, and died of massive bleeding from the stab wounds. The murderer(s) were never discovered.

She was last seen at her school, boarding her school bus at 1 pm. 12 days later, her highly decomposed body was discovered by NS servicemen undergoing their training exercises at Yishun Industrial Park. The late senior forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng could not ascertain the cause of death: he could not tell whether it was a suicide, murder or accident due to the state of decomposition, some body parts were missing and the injuries he found on the skull and ribs were not sufficient to cause death. Nevertheless, the police investigations narrowed down to one suspect: Liang's 35-year-old school bus driver Oh Laye Koh. Oh was then charged with her murder, purely based on circumstantial evidence. He was initially acquitted of her murder at the end of his trial in 1992; however, the prosecution appealed against his acquittal, pointing out how Oh, despite his insistence that he did not kill Liang or know her whereabouts, was able to lead police to the place where Liang's bag and books were, which was some distance away from where her body was found; Oh claimed he went to fix his brakes at 1 pm when the girl was last seen alive, but it was found that he went there at 9 am; and lastly, the school bus driver even contacted and tried to convince the witnesses to testify on his behalf that they did not see his school bus that day. The appeal was accepted, and the re-trial started on 27 April 1994. Oh Laye Koh chose to remain silent when he was told to make his defence. At the end of Oh's re-trial on 3 May 1994, Judicial Commissioner Amarjeet Singh concluded from Oh's decision to remain silent and also his failure to provide evidence \"arose from a consciousness of guilt in the face of the circumstantial evidence\". In JC Singh's words, he said to Oh in his verdict, \"I am constrained to draw an irresistible inference that you were the last person with the deceased and you had intentionally caused her death and that the deceased's death was not suicidal or accidental. Although the prosecution was unable to identify the unlawful act, it is not necessary, in my opinion, always to do so.\" As such, JC Singh found Oh guilty and sentenced him to death for the murder of Liang Shan Shan. Oh Laye Koh's appeal against his conviction was dismissed on 29 June 1994, and he was hanged on 19 May 1995. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s2/ep10/367437|title=True Files S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/whispers-of-the-dead-s2/ep6/379405|title=Whispers Of The Dead S2|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n==1990s==\n\n===1991===\n* 4 May 1991: Filipino domestic worker [[Flor Contemplacion]] murdered another Filipino domestic worker, Della Maga, and Nicholas Huang, the four-year-old son of Maga's employer.

Asokan, were both sentenced to death for the murder of illegal moneylender Tan Heng Hong. Some time in November 1992, both Maniam and Asokan murdered Tan and drove Tan's car to Mandai, burning it together with Tan's corpse. Despite the charred remains, Tan's identity was ascertained, as well as the cause of death: the late forensic pathologist Professor Chao Tzee Cheng identified that the cause of Tan's death was a cut artery on his neck and that he did not die in the fire. Maniam, who was eventually arrested and charged in January 1993, claimed at the trial that on the night of Tan's murder, while the three of them were arguing violently over letting Tan to pay back Asokan's commission, Asokan became so agitated that he picked up the axe Maniam bought the day before to kill Tan, and it was Asokan's idea to burn the corpse, proclaiming his innocence and he himself was forced to help dispose the corpse out of fear. However, Asokan, who fled to Malaysia and got extradited back to Singapore to face trial, stated that Maniam told him to grab the axe and kill Tan when he refused to pay the commission, saying that he did not mean to hit or kill him, and that he was only following Maniam's orders. However, the judge rejected their defences and stated that if they had no intention to kill, the weapons would not have been brought in the first place, and decided that they both shared a common intention to murder Tan, therefore both of the men were convicted as charged and sentenced to death. The two men were eventually hanged on 9 September 1995.

Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face as he held onto the wall to try to steady himself, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997. Abdul Nasir was not affected by this amendment, so his life term was still a jail term of 20 years, and thus he would still be jailed for 38 years.<ref> {{cite web|title=oriental_hotel_murder|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1804_2011-04-04.html}} </ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|title=Former detective Richard Lim Beng Gee, 65, dies: 5 high-profile cases he helped crack / ASSAULT ON TWO JAPANESE TOURISTS IN 5-STAR HOTEL|last=Lee|first=Min Kok|date=2016-01-19|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191012154609/https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/former-detective-richard-lim-beng-gee-65-dies-5-high-profile-cases-he-helped|archive-date=2019-10-12|access-date=2019-10-14}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s3/ep9/367513|title=True Files S3|website=Toggle|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===1995===\n\n* 26 February 1995: Britain's oldest merchant bank [[Barings Bank]] collapsed due to Briton [[Nick Leeson]]'s trading activities, who lost $1.4 billion by speculating on the [[Singapore International Monetary Exchange]], primarily using [[futures contracts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Barings Bank collapses from Nick Leeson's losses |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/e7cb71fe-b7b9-445e-b5d1-655bf301d6a8|website=NLB|accessdate=20 July 2019|date=26 February 1995}}</ref> He was arrested on 23 November 1995 after fleeing Singapore for 272 days.

Furious, the 26-year-old Malaysian stepped out of the car and went to find the man who hit his car, but he could only find the man's companion. The other man did not seemed to respond to Tan's furious words and continued walking (this seemingly deliberate and apparent indifference only infuriated Tan further) until Tan caught his attention and made him turn around. Tan angrily asked the man, demanding to know why his friend hit his car window. But the man did not respond, and he pushed Tan down onto the ground before making his way. Provoked by this action, Tan picked up a stick he saw next to him from the ground and used it to hit the man once on the head and hit him many times (mostly on the man's haversack) even when the man has collapsed due to loss of consciousness. Tan only stopped after the man stopped moving, could hear him breathing and left to Malaysia in his car, with the belief that the man was still alive. Unknown to Tan, the first blow he inflicted on the man's head turned out to be fatal, and the victim, 44-year-old Krishnan Sengal Rajah, died as a result. What was more shocking to Tan was when he received news of the man's death, he found out that Krishnan was a deaf-mute, which explained why he did not seem to respond to Tan or seem to ignore his words. 10 months later, Tan Chun Seng was arrested in April 2002 in Malaysia, and he was charged with the murder of Krishnan. At the trial in early 2003, Tan failed to substantiate his defence of sudden and grave provocation against the murder charge and he was sentenced to death for murdering Krishnan. Tan filed an appeal against the sentence, and veteran lawyer Subhas Anandan, who represented Tan in his appeal, raised the huge disparity in terms of height and size between Tan and the apparently larger-sized and taller victim; the heat of the moment where the victim had started a brief sudden fight with Tan by pushing Tan onto the ground, leading to Tan picking up the stick in an uncontrollable fit of anger to hit the victim; the lack of any undue advantage Tan had against the victim, as well as other factors vital to Tan in his defence of a sudden fight against the murder charge. After hearing the appeal, on 20 May 2003, the Court of Appeal allowed the appeal, amending the murder conviction to one of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and sentenced Tan to 10 years' imprisonment. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mewatch.sg/en/series/true-files-s4/ep7/367568|title=True Files S4|website=meWATCH|access-date=2020-04-22}}</ref>\n\n*10 August 2001: A day before the wedding of 33-year-old businessman Tay Teng Joo, he was kidnapped by 45-year-old Chng Teo Heng together with the assistance of his accomplices, 52-year-old businesswoman Agnes Ng Lei Eng and 42-year-old freelance painter Ng Soon Teck.

Fujian is bordered by [[Zhejiang]] to the north, [[Jiangxi]] to the west, [[Guangdong]] to the south, and the [[Taiwan Strait]] to the east. Its capital is [[Fuzhou]], while its largest city by population is [[Xiamen]], both located near the coast of the Taiwan Strait in the east of the province. The name Fujian came from the combination of [[Fuzhou]] and Jianzhou (present [[Nanping]]), a city in Fujian, during the [[Tang dynasty]].\n\nWhile its population is chiefly of ethnic Chinese origin, it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse provinces in China. Historically the dialects of the language group [[Min Chinese]] were most commonly spoken within the province, including the [[Hokkien]] dialects of southeastern Fujian. This is reflected in the abbreviation of the province's name ({{zh|labels=no|\u95fd}}). [[Hakka Chinese]] is also spoken, by the [[Hakka people]] in Fujian. Min dialects and Hakka Chinese are unintelligible with [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Due to emigration, a sizable amount of the ethnic Chinese populations of [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Philippines]] speak [[Southern Min]] (or Hokkien).\n\nAs a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], [[#History|Historical Fujian]] is now divided between the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC, Taiwan), and both territories are named the Fujian province in their respective administration divisions. The majority of the territory of historical Fujian (the mainland territory and a few islands) currently make up the Fujian province of the PRC. The [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian province]] of the ROC is made up of the [[Matsu Islands]], the [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu Islands]] and the [[Kinmen|Kinmen Islands]], the two latter archipelagos constituting [[Kinmen County]].\n\nWith a population of 39 million, Fujian ranks [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|17th in population]] among Chinese provinces. Its GDP is CN\u00a53.58 trillion, [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|ranking 10th in GDP]]. Along with its coastal neighbours Zhejiang and Guangdong, Fujian's GDP per capita is above the national average, at CN\u00a592,830. It has benefited from its geographical proximity with Taiwan.\n\n==History==\n===Prehistoric Fujian===\nRecent archaeological discoveries in 2011 demonstrate that Fujian had entered the [[Neolithic Age]] by the middle of the 6th millennium BC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rolett, Barry V.; Zheng, Zhuo; Yue, Yuanfu|first=|date=April 2011|title=Holocene sea-level change and the emergence of Neolithic seafaring in the Fuzhou Basin (Fujian, China)|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011QSRv...30..788R|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=30|pages=788\u2013797|via=|access-date=June 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830164625/http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011QSRv...30..788R|archive-date=August 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> From the Keqiutou site (7450\u20135590 BP), an early Neolithic site in [[Pingtan Island]] located about {{convert|70|km}} southeast of Fuzhou, numerous tools made of stones, [[Animal shell|shell]]s, [[bone]]s, [[jade]]s, and [[ceramic]]s (including wheel-made ceramics) have been unearthed, together with [[spinning wheel]]s, which is definitive evidence of [[weaving]].\n\nThe Tanshishan ({{lang|zh-hant|\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71}}) site (5500\u20134000 BP) in suburban Fuzhou spans the Neolithic and [[Chalcolithic]] Age where semi-underground circular buildings were found in the lower level. The Huangtulun ({{lang|zh-hant|\u9ec3\u571f\u5d19}}) site (ca.1325 BC), also in suburban Fuzhou, was of the [[Bronze Age]] in character.\n\nTianlong Jiao (2013)<ref name=\"Jiao2013\">Jiao, Tianlong. 2013. \"The Neolithic Archaeology of Southeast China.\" In Underhill, Anne P., et al. ''A Companion to Chinese Archaeology'', 599-611. Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> notes that the [[Neolithic]] appeared on the coast of Fujian around 6,000 B.P. During the Neolithic, the coast of Fujian had a low population density, with the population depending on mostly on fishing and hunting, along with limited agriculture.\n\nThere were four major Neolithic cultures in coastal Fujian, with the earliest Neolithic cultures originating from the north in coastal [[Zhejiang]].<ref name=\"Jiao2013\"/>\n*Keqiutou culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u58f3\u4e18\u5934\u6587\u5316}}; c. 6000\u20135500 BP, or c. 4050\u20133550 BC)\n*Tanshishan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u6619\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}; c. 5000\u20134300 BP, or c. 3050\u20132350 BC)\n*Damaoshan culture ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u5927\u5e3d\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}; c. 5000\u20134300 BP)\n*Huangguashan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u9ec4\u74dc\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}; c. 4300\u20133500 BP, or c. 2350\u20131550 BC)\n\nThere were two major Neolithic cultures in inland Fujian, which were highly distinct from the coastal Fujian Neolithic cultures.<ref name=\"Jiao2013\"/> These are the Niubishan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u725b\u9f3b\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}) from 5000\u20134000 years ago, and the Hulushan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u846b\u82a6\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}) from 2050 to 1550 BC.\n\n===Minyue kingdom===\n\n{{Main|Minyue}}\nFujian was also where the kingdom of [[Minyue]] was located. The word \"M\u01d0nyu\u00e8\" was derived by combining \"M\u01d0n\" ({{zh|t=\u95a9 |s=\u95fd |poj=b\u00e2n}}), which is perhaps an ethnic name ({{zh|t=\u883b |s=\u86ee |p=m\u00e1n |poj=b\u00e2n |links=no}}), and \"[[Baiyue|Yu\u00e8]]\", after the [[State of Yue]], a [[Spring and Autumn period]] kingdom in [[Zhejiang]] to the north. This is because the royal family of Yu\u00e8 fled to Fujian after its kingdom was annexed by the [[State of Chu]] in 306 BC. M\u01d0n is also the name of the [[Min River (Fujian)|main river]] in this area, but the ethnonym is probably older.\n\n===Qin dynasty===\n[[Li Si]], the famous prime minister of Qin, deposed the king of Minyue, establishing instead a paramilitary province there called Minzhong Commandery.<ref>Brittanica</ref> Minyue was a ''de facto'' kingdom until one of the emperors of the [[Qin dynasty]], the first unified imperial Chinese state, abolished its status.\n\n===Han dynasty===\n{{see also|Han campaigns against Minyue}}\nIn the aftermath of the Qin dynasty's fall, [[Chu\u2013Han Contention|civil war]] broke out between two warlords, [[Xiang Yu]] and [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]]. The Minyue king Wuzhu sent his troops to fight with Liu and his gamble paid off. Liu was victorious and founded the [[Han dynasty]]. In 202 BC, he restored Minyue's status as a [[tributary state|tributary]] independent kingdom. Thus Wuzhu was allowed to construct his fortified city in [[Fuzhou]] as well as a few locations in the [[Wuyi Mountains]], which have been excavated in recent years. His kingdom extended beyond the borders of contemporary Fujian into eastern [[Guangdong]], eastern [[Jiangxi]], and southern [[Zhejiang]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200222123322/https://global.britannica.com/place/Fujian#ref591270 Fuijan]. Britannica.com.</ref>\n\nAfter Wuzhu's death, Minyue maintained its militant tradition and launched several expeditions against its neighboring kingdoms in [[Guangdong]], [[Jiangxi]], and [[Zhejiang]], primarily in the 2nd century BC. This was stopped by the [[Han dynasty]] as it [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty|expanded southward]]. The Han emperor eventually decided to get rid of the potential threat by launching a [[Han campaigns against Minyue|military campaign]] against Minyue. Large forces approached Minyue simultaneously from four directions via land and sea in 111 BC. The rulers in Fuzhou surrendered to avoid a futile fight and destruction and the first kingdom in Fujian history came to an abrupt end.\n\nFujian was part of the much larger [[Yang Province]] (Yangzhou), whose provincial capital was designated in Liyang (\u6b77\u967d; present-day [[He County, Anhui]]).\n\nThe [[Han dynasty]] collapsed at the end of the 2nd century AD, paving the way for the [[Three Kingdoms]] era. [[Sun Quan]], the founder of the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]], spent nearly 20 years subduing the Shan Yue people, the branch of the Yue living in mountains.\n\n===Jin era===\nThe first wave of [[Migration of the eight clans|immigration]] of the noble class arrived in the province in the early 4th century when the [[Western Jin dynasty]] collapsed and the north was torn apart by invasions by nomadic peoples from the north, as well as civil war. These immigrants were primarily from eight families in [[central China]]: {{cn-span|[[Lin (surname)|Lin]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u6797}}), [[Huang (surname)|Huang]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|\u9ec4}}), [[Chen (surname)|Chen]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|\u9648}}), [[Zheng (surname)|Zheng]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|\u90d1}}), [[Zhan (surname)|Zhan]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u8a79}}), [[Qi\u016b (surname)|Qiu]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u90b1}}, [[He (surname)|He]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u4f55}}, and [[Hu (surname)|Hu]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u80e1}}. The first four remain as the major surnames of modern Fujian.|date=April 2020}}\n\nNevertheless, isolation from nearby areas owing to rugged terrain contributed to Fujian's relatively undeveloped economy and level of development, despite major population boosts from northern China during the \"barbarian\" invasions. Population density in Fujian remained low compared to the rest of China. Only two [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] and sixteen counties were established by the Western Jin dynasty. Like other southern provinces such as [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Guizhou]], and [[Yunnan]], Fujian often served as a destination for exiled prisoners and dissidents at that time.\n\nDuring the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era, the [[Southern Dynasties]] ([[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]], [[Southern Qi]], [[Liang dynasty|Liang]] ([[Western Liang (555\u2013587)|Western Liang]]), and [[Chen dynasty|Chen]]) reigned south of the [[Yangtze River]], including Fujian.\n\n===Sui and Tang dynasties===\n{{see also|Early western influence in Fujian}}\nDuring the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] eras a large influx of migrants settled in Fujian.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIKTj-KgN40C&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=fatutilse | title=The Pan-Pearl River Delta: An Emerging Regional Economy in a Globalizing China | page=41}}</ref> The area did not become Sinicized until this time.<ref>Britannica</ref> \n\nDuring the Sui dynasty, Fujian was again part of [[Yang Province]].\n\nDuring the Tang, Fujian was part of the larger [[Jiangnan East Circuit]], whose capital was at [[Suzhou]]. Modern-day Fujian was composed of around 5 prefectures and 25 counties.\n\nThe Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) oversaw the next golden age of China, which contributed to a boom in Fujian's culture and economy. [[Fuzhou]]'s economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang dynasty saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland, prompting even larger waves of northerners to immigrate to northern part of Fujian.\n\n===Five Dynasties Ten Kingdoms===\nAs the Tang dynasty ended, China was torn apart in the period of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]]. During this time, a second major wave of immigration arrived in the safe haven of Fujian, led by General Wang, who set up an independent [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Kingdom of Min]] with its capital in Fuzhou. After the death of the founding king, however, the kingdom suffered from internal strife, and was soon absorbed by [[Southern Tang]], another southern kingdom.<ref>Fukien. (2008).

Fujian is bordered by [[Zhejiang]] to the north, [[Jiangxi]] to the west, [[Guangdong]] to the south, and the [[Taiwan Strait]] to the east. Its capital is [[Fuzhou]], while its largest city by population is [[Xiamen]], both located near the coast of the Taiwan Strait in the east of the province. The name Fujian came from the combination of [[Fuzhou]] and Jianzhou (present [[Nanping]]), a city in Fujian, during the [[Tang dynasty]].\n\nWhile its population is chiefly of ethnic Chinese origin, it is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse provinces in China. Historically the dialects of the language group [[Min Chinese]] were most commonly spoken within the province, including the [[Hokkien]] dialects of southeastern Fujian. This is reflected in the abbreviation of the province's name ({{zh|labels=no|\u95fd}}). [[Hakka Chinese]] is also spoken, by the [[Hakka people]] in Fujian. Min dialects and Hakka Chinese are unintelligible with [[Mandarin Chinese]]. Due to emigration, a sizable amount of the ethnic Chinese populations of [[Taiwan]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]] and [[Philippines]] speak [[Southern Min]] (or Hokkien).\n\nAs a result of the [[Chinese Civil War]], [[#History|Historical Fujian]] is now divided between the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) and the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] (ROC, Taiwan), and both territories are named the Fujian province in their respective administration divisions. The majority of the territory of historical Fujian (the mainland territory and a few islands) currently make up the Fujian province of the PRC. The [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fujian province]] of the ROC is made up of the [[Matsu Islands]], the [[Wuqiu, Kinmen|Wuqiu Islands]] and the [[Kinmen|Kinmen Islands]], the two latter archipelagos constituting [[Kinmen County]].\n\nWith a population of 39 million, Fujian ranks [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|17th in population]] among Chinese provinces. Its GDP is CN\u00a53.58 trillion, [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|ranking 10th in GDP]]. Along with its coastal neighbours Zhejiang and Guangdong, Fujian's GDP per capita is above the national average, at CN\u00a592,830. It has benefited from its geographical proximity with Taiwan.\n\n==History==\n===Prehistoric Fujian===\nRecent archaeological discoveries in 2011 demonstrate that Fujian had entered the [[Neolithic Age]] by the middle of the 6th millennium BC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rolett, Barry V.; Zheng, Zhuo; Yue, Yuanfu|first=|date=April 2011|title=Holocene sea-level change and the emergence of Neolithic seafaring in the Fuzhou Basin (Fujian, China)|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011QSRv...30..788R|journal=Quaternary Science Reviews|volume=30|pages=788\u2013797|via=|access-date=June 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830164625/http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011QSRv...30..788R|archive-date=August 30, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> From the Keqiutou site (7450\u20135590 BP), an early Neolithic site in [[Pingtan Island]] located about {{convert|70|km}} southeast of Fuzhou, numerous tools made of stones, [[Animal shell|shell]]s, [[bone]]s, [[jade]]s, and [[ceramic]]s (including wheel-made ceramics) have been unearthed, together with [[spinning wheel]]s, which is definitive evidence of [[weaving]].\n\nThe Tanshishan ({{lang|zh-hant|\u66c7\u77f3\u5c71}}) site (5500\u20134000 BP) in suburban Fuzhou spans the Neolithic and [[Chalcolithic]] Age where semi-underground circular buildings were found in the lower level. The Huangtulun ({{lang|zh-hant|\u9ec3\u571f\u5d19}}) site (ca.1325 BC), also in suburban Fuzhou, was of the [[Bronze Age]] in character.\n\nTianlong Jiao (2013)<ref name=\"Jiao2013\">Jiao, Tianlong. 2013. \"The Neolithic Archaeology of Southeast China.\" In Underhill, Anne P., et al. ''A Companion to Chinese Archaeology'', 599-611. Wiley-Blackwell.</ref> notes that the [[Neolithic]] appeared on the coast of Fujian around 6,000 B.P. During the Neolithic, the coast of Fujian had a low population density, with the population depending on mostly on fishing and hunting, along with limited agriculture.\n\nThere were four major Neolithic cultures in coastal Fujian, with the earliest Neolithic cultures originating from the north in coastal [[Zhejiang]].<ref name=\"Jiao2013\"/>\n*Keqiutou culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u58f3\u4e18\u5934\u6587\u5316}}; c. 6000\u20135500 BP, or c. 4050\u20133550 BC)\n*Tanshishan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u6619\u77f3\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}; c. 5000\u20134300 BP, or c. 3050\u20132350 BC)\n*Damaoshan culture ({{zh|labels=no|c=\u5927\u5e3d\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}; c. 5000\u20134300 BP)\n*Huangguashan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u9ec4\u74dc\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}; c. 4300\u20133500 BP, or c. 2350\u20131550 BC)\n\nThere were two major Neolithic cultures in inland Fujian, which were highly distinct from the coastal Fujian Neolithic cultures.<ref name=\"Jiao2013\"/> These are the Niubishan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u725b\u9f3b\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}) from 5000\u20134000 years ago, and the Hulushan culture ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u846b\u82a6\u5c71\u6587\u5316}}) from 2050 to 1550 BC.\n\n===Minyue kingdom===\n\n{{Main|Minyue}}\nFujian was also where the kingdom of [[Minyue]] was located. The word \"M\u01d0nyu\u00e8\" was derived by combining \"M\u01d0n\" ({{zh|t=\u95a9 |s=\u95fd |poj=b\u00e2n}}), which is perhaps an ethnic name ({{zh|t=\u883b |s=\u86ee |p=m\u00e1n |poj=b\u00e2n |links=no}}), and \"[[Baiyue|Yu\u00e8]]\", after the [[State of Yue]], a [[Spring and Autumn period]] kingdom in [[Zhejiang]] to the north. This is because the royal family of Yu\u00e8 fled to Fujian after its kingdom was annexed by the [[State of Chu]] in 306 BC. M\u01d0n is also the name of the [[Min River (Fujian)|main river]] in this area, but the ethnonym is probably older.\n\n===Qin dynasty===\n[[Li Si]], the famous prime minister of Qin, deposed the king of Minyue, establishing instead a paramilitary province there called Minzhong Commandery.<ref>Brittanica</ref> Minyue was a ''de facto'' kingdom until one of the emperors of the [[Qin dynasty]], the first unified imperial Chinese state, abolished its status.\n\n===Han dynasty===\n{{see also|Han campaigns against Minyue}}\nIn the aftermath of the Qin dynasty's fall, [[Chu\u2013Han Contention|civil war]] broke out between two warlords, [[Xiang Yu]] and [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]]. The Minyue king Wuzhu sent his troops to fight with Liu and his gamble paid off. Liu was victorious and founded the [[Han dynasty]]. In 202 BC, he restored Minyue's status as a [[tributary state|tributary]] independent kingdom. Thus Wuzhu was allowed to construct his fortified city in [[Fuzhou]] as well as a few locations in the [[Wuyi Mountains]], which have been excavated in recent years. His kingdom extended beyond the borders of contemporary Fujian into eastern [[Guangdong]], eastern [[Jiangxi]], and southern [[Zhejiang]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200222123322/https://global.britannica.com/place/Fujian#ref591270 Fuijan]. Britannica.com.</ref>\n\nAfter Wuzhu's death, Minyue maintained its militant tradition and launched several expeditions against its neighboring kingdoms in [[Guangdong]], [[Jiangxi]], and [[Zhejiang]], primarily in the 2nd century BC. This was stopped by the [[Han dynasty]] as it [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty|expanded southward]]. The Han emperor eventually decided to get rid of the potential threat by launching a [[Han campaigns against Minyue|military campaign]] against Minyue. Large forces approached Minyue simultaneously from four directions via land and sea in 111 BC. The rulers in Fuzhou surrendered to avoid a futile fight and destruction and the first kingdom in Fujian history came to an abrupt end.\n\nFujian was part of the much larger [[Yang Province]] (Yangzhou), whose provincial capital was designated in Liyang (\u6b77\u967d; present-day [[He County, Anhui]]).\n\nThe [[Han dynasty]] collapsed at the end of the 2nd century AD, paving the way for the [[Three Kingdoms]] era. [[Sun Quan]], the founder of the [[Eastern Wu|Kingdom of Wu]], spent nearly 20 years subduing the Shan Yue people, the branch of the Yue living in mountains.\n\n===Jin era===\nThe first wave of [[Migration of the eight clans|immigration]] of the noble class arrived in the province in the early 4th century when the [[Western Jin dynasty]] collapsed and the north was torn apart by invasions by nomadic peoples from the north, as well as civil war. These immigrants were primarily from eight families in [[central China]]: {{cn-span|[[Lin (surname)|Lin]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u6797}}), [[Huang (surname)|Huang]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|\u9ec4}}), [[Chen (surname)|Chen]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|\u9648}}), [[Zheng (surname)|Zheng]] ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|\u90d1}}), [[Zhan (surname)|Zhan]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u8a79}}), [[Qi\u016b (surname)|Qiu]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u90b1}}, [[He (surname)|He]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u4f55}}, and [[Hu (surname)|Hu]] ({{linktext|lang=zh|\u80e1}}. The first four remain as the major surnames of modern Fujian.|date=April 2020}}\n\nNevertheless, isolation from nearby areas owing to rugged terrain contributed to Fujian's relatively undeveloped economy and level of development, despite major population boosts from northern China during the \"barbarian\" invasions. Population density in Fujian remained low compared to the rest of China. Only two [[Commandery (China)|commanderies]] and sixteen counties were established by the Western Jin dynasty. Like other southern provinces such as [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Guizhou]], and [[Yunnan]], Fujian often served as a destination for exiled prisoners and dissidents at that time.\n\nDuring the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era, the [[Southern Dynasties]] ([[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]], [[Southern Qi]], [[Liang dynasty|Liang]] ([[Western Liang (555\u2013587)|Western Liang]]), and [[Chen dynasty|Chen]]) reigned south of the [[Yangtze River]], including Fujian.\n\n===Sui and Tang dynasties===\n{{see also|Early western influence in Fujian}}\nDuring the [[Sui Dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] eras a large influx of migrants settled in Fujian.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AIKTj-KgN40C&pg=PA41#v=onepage&q&f=fatutilse | title=The Pan-Pearl River Delta: An Emerging Regional Economy in a Globalizing China | page=41}}</ref> The area did not become Sinicized until this time.<ref>Britannica</ref> \n\nDuring the Sui dynasty, Fujian was again part of [[Yang Province]].\n\nDuring the Tang, Fujian was part of the larger [[Jiangnan East Circuit]], whose capital was at [[Suzhou]]. Modern-day Fujian was composed of around 5 prefectures and 25 counties.\n\nThe Tang dynasty (618\u2013907) oversaw the next golden age of China, which contributed to a boom in Fujian's culture and economy. [[Fuzhou]]'s economic and cultural institutions grew and developed. The later years of the Tang dynasty saw a number of political upheavals in the Chinese heartland, prompting even larger waves of northerners to immigrate to northern part of Fujian.\n\n===Five Dynasties Ten Kingdoms===\nAs the Tang dynasty ended, China was torn apart in the period of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms]]. During this time, a second major wave of immigration arrived in the safe haven of Fujian, led by General Wang, who set up an independent [[Min (Ten Kingdoms)|Kingdom of Min]] with its capital in Fuzhou.

Danxia [[landform]] is formed from red-coloured [[sandstone]]s and [[Conglomerate (geology)|conglomerates]] of largely [[Cretaceous]] age. The landforms look very much like [[karst]] topography that forms in areas underlain by [[limestone]]s, but since the rocks that form danxia are sandstones and conglomerates, they have been called \"pseudo-karst\" landforms. They were formed by endogenous forces (including [[Tectonic uplift|uplift]]) and exogenous forces (including [[weathering]] and [[erosion]])\n\n==Notable individuals==\nThe province and its diaspora abroad also has a tradition of educational achievement and has produced many important scholars, statesmen and other notable people since the time of the [[Song dynasty]], such as:\n*[[Cai Jing]] (1047\u20131126), government official and calligrapher who lived during the Northern Song dynasty\n*[[Li Gang (Song dynasty)|Li Gang]] (1083\u20131140), a politician and general serving during the transition from the Northern Song to the Southern Song dynasty\n*[[Zhu Xi]] (1130\u20131200), Confucian philosopher\n*[[Ong Sum Ping]] (14th\u201315th century), royal son-in-law of Sultan [[Muhammad Shah of Brunei]]\n*[[Yu Dayou]] (1503\u20131579), Ming dynasty general and martial artist\n*[[Ingen]] (1592\u20131673), well known Buddhist monk, poet and calligrapher who lived during Ming Dynasty\n*[[Hong Chengchou]] (1593\u20131665), Ming dynasty official\n*[[Shi Lang]] (1621\u20131696), Qing dynasty admiral\n*[[Koxinga]] (1624\u20131662), Ming dynasty general who expelled the Dutch from Taiwan\n*[[Lin Zexu]] (1785\u20131850), Qing dynasty scholar and official\n*[[Zhan Shi Chai]] (1840s\u20131893), entertainer as \"Chang the Chinese giant\"\n*[[Wong Nai Siong]] (1849\u20131924), scholar, revolutionary, discovered the town of [[Sibu]] in [[Sarawak]], east [[Malaysia]] in 1901\n*[[Lin Shu]] (1852\u20131924), translator\n*[[Yan Fu]] (1854\u20131921), scholar and translator\n*[[Sa Zhenbing]] (1859\u20131952), high-ranking naval officer of [[Mongols|Mongolian]] origin\n*[[Zheng Xiaoxu]] (1860\u20131938), statesman, diplomat and calligrapher\n*Lin Changmin([[:zh:\u6797\u9577\u6c11]]) (1876\u20141925), a high-rank governor in the Beiyang Government\n*[[Lin Juemin]] (1887\u20131911), one of 72 [[Second Guangzhou Uprising|Revolutionary Martyrs]] at Huanghuagang, Guangzhou\n*[[Lin Yutang]] (1894\u20131976), writer\n*[[Zheng Zhenduo]] (1898\u20131958), literary historian\n*[[Ong Schan Tchow]] ({{zh|c=[[:zh:\u7fc1\u5360\u79cb|\u7fc1\u5360\u79cb]]}}) (1900\u20131945), artist well known for the painting of the \u201cBook of Chrysanthemums\u201d\n*[[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]] (1861\u20131896), National Hero of the [[Philippines]] whose lineage is from Fujian\n*[[Lin Huiyin]] (1904\u20131955), architect and writer\n*Tsai Chi-Kun (1912\u20132004), \"father of the Taiwan Symphony\"\n*[[Go Seigen]] (1914\u20132014), [[pseudonym]] of [[Go (board game)|Go]] champion W\u00fa Q\u012bngyu\u00e1n\n*[[Sudono Salim|Liem Sioe Liong]] (1916\u20132012), a Chinese-born Indonesian businessman of [[Fuqing]] origin, founder of [[Salim Group]]\n*[[Lin Dan]] (born 1983), professional badminton player\n*[[Jeremy Lin]] (born 1988), professional basketball player\n*[[Qian Kun]] (born 1996), singer, member/leader of boy group [[WayV]]\n\n==Sports==\nFujian includes professional sports teams in both the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] and the [[China League One|Chinese League One]].\n\nThe representative of the province in the [[Chinese Basketball Association]] are the [[Fujian Sturgeons]], who are based in [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang]], [[Quanzhou]].
