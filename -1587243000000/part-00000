The MT-L was developed to meet this requirement based on the [[PT-76]] amphibious light tank chassis. The MT-LB is the armored variant of the MT-L. Entering production in the early 1970s, it was cheap to build, being based on many existing components, e.g. the engine, which was originally developed for trucks.

The MT-L was developed to meet this requirement based on the [[PT-76]] amphibious light tank chassis. The MT-LB is the armored variant of the MT-L.

That included two-seat variants of fighter or attack/strike aircraft (including late 20th century types such as the [[F-4 Phantom II]], [[A-6 Intruder]], [[F-111]], [[Panavia Tornado]], [[Sukhoi_Su-24|Su-24 Fencer]] and [[Sukhoi_Su-30|Su-30MK Flanker-C]], [[Dassault Mirage 2000N/2000D]]). \n\nFrom the 1970s onward an aircraft with two-member crews, such as the [[F-15E Strike Eagle]], [[F/A-18F Super Hornet]] or [[Sukhoi_Su-34|Su-34 Fullback]] and [[Dassault Rafale|Dassault Rafale B]] have often featured programmable [[multi-function display]]s. These programs allow roles to be more flexible than previous generation aircraft. Multiple crew members can be responsible for detecting, targeting and engaging air-to-air or ground targets, communications, datalinks and/or defensive systems. Roles can be customized based on experience, expertise, workload, tactics, and weapons being employed. Pilots usually retain the responsibility for flying the aircraft in tactical situations. However, the crews of dedicated bomber aircraft usually retain distinct, rigidly-defined and conventional roles.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:170906-F-ER377-900.jpg|(F-15E Pilot & WSO)\nFile:140507-F-OR423-003.jpg|(B-1B Lancer WSO)\nFile:180419-N-TV230-2298-2.jpg|(F-18 Pilot & WSO)\nFile:McDonnell_Douglas_F-4C-21-MC_061006-F-1234S-020.jpg|(F-4 with tandem pilot & WSO canopies open)\nFile:Sukhoi_Su-34_(Simulator),_Russia_-_Air_Force_AN2242851.jpg|(SU-34 pilot & WSO positions in simulator)\n</gallery>\n\n==United Kingdom==\nIn the [[Royal Air Force]], a WSO is a commissioned officer that operates aircraft mission systems formerly on the [[Tornado GR4]], however now on the [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|Reaper]], [[Raytheon Sentinel|Sentinel R1]], [[Boeing RC-135|Rivet Joint]], [[Boeing E-3 Sentry|E3 Sentry]] and the [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|P-8 Poseidon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/recruitment/roles/roles-finder/aircrew/weapon-systems-officer|title=RAF Recruitment {{!}} Weapon Systems Officer {{!}} Royal Air Force|website=www.raf.mod.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nNon-commissioned Aircrew can serve as a WSOp (Weapon Systems Operator), an umbrella term for the various specialist aircrew responsible for assisting the pilot in operating the mission systems of the aircraft (e.g. linguists, loadmasters, crewman).<ref>[http://www.raf.mod.uk/careers/jobs/weaponssystemoperator.cfm RAF - Weapon Systems Operator]</ref>\n\n==United States==\n===Overview===\n====U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps====\nIn the [[United States Navy]], WSOs are [[naval flight officer]]s responsible for manning the weapon systems of the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18F Super Hornet]] [[Fighter aircraft|strike fighter]] from that jet's aft seat.  Prior to the introduction of the F/A-18F, they were known as Radar Intercept Officers (RIO) in the aft seats of the [[F-4 Phantom II]] and [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14 Tomcat]]; as Bombardier/Navigators (B/N) in the right seat of the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6 Intruder]] and the [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3 Skywarrior]] and in the aft seat in the [[North American A-5 Vigilante|A-5 Vigilante]]; and Reconnaissance Attack Navigators (RAN) in the aft seat of the [[A-5 Vigilante|RA-5C Vigilante]].\n\nIn the [[United States Marine Corps]], \"WSO\" refers to [[naval flight officer]]s serving as the aft crew member of the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18D Hornet]].  Prior to the introduction of the F/A-18D, they also served as Radar Intercept Officers (RIO) in the aft seat of the [[F-4 Phantom II]], Reconnaissance Systems Officers (RSO) in the aft seat of reconnaissance aircraft such as the [[F-4 Phantom II|RF-4B Phantom II]] and as Bombardier/Navigators (B/N) in the right seat of the A-6 Intruder. Until mid-2019, the Marines also employed Naval Flight Officers in the [[Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler|EA-6B Prowler]], where they were known as Electronic Countermeasures Officers (ECMO, pronounced \u201cEK-mo\u201d).\n\nIn U.S. Naval Aviation ([[USN]] & [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]]), when designated as the mission commander (MC), the WSO is responsible for all phases of the assigned mission, especially if there are multiple aircraft involved.  For example, the aircraft pilot could be the junior member of a flight crew such as a USN lieutenant, junior grade/USMC 1st lieutenant or USN lieutenant/USMC captain, and the weapon systems officer could be a senior officer such as a USN lieutenant commander, commander or captain, or a USMC major, lieutenant colonel, or colonel; this would likely make the WSO the mission commander.\n\n====U.S. Air Force====\nIn the [[U.S. Air Force]], \"WSO\" also refers to a USAF [[combat systems officer]] (CSO, formerly USAF navigator) who is the aft crew member in the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15E Strike Eagle]]. In the B-52, the CSO crew members on the lower deck of the aircraft who were previously designated as navigator and radar navigator (bombardier) are now known as weapon systems officers while the CSO on the upper deck is an electronic warfare officer. In the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B Lancer]] bomber, there are 2 weapon systems officers manning crew positions aft of the pilot and co-pilot. They are known as the Offensive Systems Officer (OSO), and the Defensive Systems Officer (DSO).  WSOs also flew in the now-retired [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111]] Aardvark strike bomber, flown by the [[US Air Force]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]], and the now retired USAF [[General Dynamics\u2013Grumman EF-111A Raven|EF-111A]] Raven airborne jammer. In the F-111, the WSO (EWO in the EF-111) was seated directly to the right of the pilot/aircraft commander. The WSO integrates with the [[Aviator|pilot]] to collectively achieve and maintain crew efficiency, situational awareness and mission effectiveness. In the U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft such as the F-15E Strike Eagle, the WSO can pilot the aircraft when required, although this is typically during non-tactical portions of the mission (e.g., en route to mission area or returning to base). When designated as the mission commander (MC), the WSO is also responsible for all phases of the assigned mission, especially if there are multiple aircraft involved.  For example, the aircraft pilot could be the junior member of a flight crew such as a first lieutenant or captain, and the weapon systems officer could be a senior officer such as a major, lieutenant colonel, or colonel; regardless of rank, the WSO would be the mission commander if he/she is qualified.\n\n===Training===\nCurrently, all USN WSOs begin their training as student naval flight officers (SNFO) at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]]. Training begins with Introductory Flight Screening, where the WSO flies a [[Cessna 172]] or [[Piper PA-28]] variant to show he/she is competent enough in aviation to continue the rigorous training ahead.  Then the SNFO starts the U.S. Navy indoctrination course called Aviation Preflight Indoctrination (API) with his/her student [[naval aviator]] (pilot) counterparts.  After six weeks of ground school and basic water survival training during API, future SWSOs (Student WSOs), at that point known as student naval flight officers (SNFO) check into the primary Training Squadron for SNFOs, the [[VT-10]] Wildcats.\n\n====Primary====\nTraining begins with several weeks of ground school followed by remnants of the \"super-fo\" program from the U.S. Navy where the SNFO takes front seat of the new [[Beechcraft T-6 Texan II|T-6 Texan II]] for six \"contact\" flights where the student will become familiar with the T-6. The SNFO is treated like a pilot training student for these six flights. After Contacts, the SNFO goes back to academics to learn [[Instrument flight rules|instrument flying rules]]. Primary ends with a final instrument checkride. After primary the SNFO is compared to his or her shipmates and selected for either land-based naval aircraft or tailhook aircraft. Those SNFOs destined for the carrier-based [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C or E-2D Hawkeye]] will be known as air control officers and combat information center officers, while those destined for the EA-18G Growler (USN only) will be electronic warfare officers (EWO). Those destined for the F/A-18F Super Hornet (USN Only) or the F/A-18D Hornet (USMC only) will become WSOs.\n\n====Intermediate====\nIntermediate picks up where Primary ends for USAF SWSOs. After the instrument phase of training, students move to visual navigation (VNAV) \"low levels\" at 2000'AGL, and finish in the T-6 with a final training block called \"forms\" (formation flying). Forms consist of four flights of learning the basics of close in formation flying. After forms, SWSOs head back to ground school to learn an entirely new aircraft, the USN [[North American Sabreliner|T-39 Sabreliner]]. The T-39 is used as an intermediate instrument and low-level trainer for SWSOs, where they receive a total of eight flights. Students are required to learn the aircraft in a two-week ground school period before they go flight side. In contrast, T-6 ground school is four weeks. Training ends at either VT-10 or VT-4 with the \"i-grad\" ceremony and top graduate award.\n\n====Advanced====\nVT-86 is where all the training comes together to culminate in the SWSO receiving his or her wings of gold. In the T-39, a USN twin-engine jet trainer, SWSOs learn advanced instrument flying, radar navigation (consisting of navigating using an A/G radar from early F-16s), and composite visual/radar navigation. Training takes place on both VR and IR routes that criss-cross the south east United States. After A/G training, track selection takes place. Navy SWSOs select either the F/A-18F Super Hornet, or the E/A-18 Growler. Marine SWSOs by default select the F/A-18D Hornet. The final three months of some of the hardest training at Pensacola will leave the SWSO F/A-18 selectee with their wings of gold. Air Force WSOs no longer train at VT-86.\n\n====Graduate training====\nFollowing the winging ceremony, USN and USMC WSOs will proceed to a Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) and USAF WSOs to a Formal Training Unit (FTU) to complete advanced ground school and flight training to prepare them for their \"operational\" combat aircraft in the deployable operating forces.\n\n'''Parachuting water survival'''<br />\nAll USAF aviators with parachutes on the aircraft attend this three-day course at NAS Pensacola, Florida. During the course, USAF WSOs learn the basics of surviving an aircraft ejection over water, obtaining food and drinkable water when stranded at sea, combat evasion at sea, and how to be successfully rescued by boat or helicopter. For USN and USMC WSOs, this program was previously completed at NAS Pensacola during their Aviation Preflight Indoctrination (API) training.\n\n'''Centrifuge training'''<br />\nThis one-day course located at [[Brooks City-Base]], San Antonio, Texas, tests USAF WSOs selected for the F-15E in their ability to withstand the [[g-force]]s routinely experienced by fighter aircrew.\n\n'''SERE'''<br />\nThe [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]] (SERE) training course trains all USAF aircrew basic survival skills, combat evasion, and techniques to resist exploitation if captured. WSOs also learn how to survive an aircraft ejection over land. For USAF personnel, the three-week course is taught at [[Fairchild Air Force Base]], Washington and the surrounding areas. The counterpart course for USN and USMC WSOs is taught at [[NAS North Island]] (academics) and [[Warner Springs, California]] (field exercise) for Pacific Fleet personnel and at Brunswick, Maine for Atlantic Fleet personnel.\n\n'''IFF'''<br />\nUSAF WSOs selected for the F-15E learn [[basic fighter maneuvers]] (BFM) and surface attack in the [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38C]] at '''Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals''' (IFF). WSOs complete this training at either the [[435th Fighter Training Squadron]] at [[Randolph Air Force Base]], Texas or the [[49th Fighter Training Squadron]] at [[Columbus Air Force Base]], Mississippi. WSOs also learn about the culture of being a young aircrew member in a USAF fighter squadron. The course lasts approximately eight weeks.\n\n'''EWO'''<br />\nUSAF WSOs selected for the B-1B, [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]], and some F-15E selectees will become [[electronic warfare officer]]s (EWOs) by attending this 12-week training program at the [[563d Flying Training Squadron]] at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. A similar program for USN EWOs in the EA-18G and USMC ECMOs in the EA-6B is conducted at the '''Center for Information Dominance''' at [[Corry Station]], Florida. In both programs, students learn the basics of radar theory, electronic attack, and electronic defense.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|Aviation}}\n\n* [[Aircrew]] (Flight crew)\n* [[Combat Systems Officer]]\n* [[Naval Flight Officer]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104500/b-1b-lancer/ Factsheet B-1B Lancer]\n*[https://www.boeing.com/defense/b-1b-bomber/ Factsheet B-1B Lancer, Boeing]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20030802043924/http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=102 Factsheet F-15E Strike Eagle]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070328164103/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/fa18/index.htm F/A-18 C/D Fact Sheet]\n\n[[Category:Military aviation occupations]]\n[[Category:United States Air Force specialisms]]\n[[Category:United States Navy job titles]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n{{globalize|date=September 2014}}\n}}\n\n[[File:F-15E cockpit view from tanker.jpg|thumb|F-15E cockpit view from tanker; pilot and WSO visible]]\n{{Military ranks | state=expanded}}\n\nA '''Weapon Systems Officer''' ('''WSO'''; \"'''wizzo'''\" as a common nickname) is an air flight officer directly involved in all air operations and [[List of aircraft weapons|weapon systems]] of a military aircraft.\n\nHistorically, aircrew duties in military aircraft were highly specialised and rigid, because the relevant controls, instruments/displays, and/or weapons were concentrated in front of particular seats, panels or positions.

However, the crews of dedicated bomber aircraft usually retain distinct, rigidly-defined and conventional roles.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed-hover\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:170906-F-ER377-900.jpg|(F-15E Pilot & WSO)\nFile:140507-F-OR423-003.jpg|(B-1B Lancer WSO)\nFile:180419-N-TV230-2298-2.jpg|(F-18 Pilot & WSO)\nFile:McDonnell_Douglas_F-4C-21-MC_061006-F-1234S-020.jpg|(F-4 with tandem pilot & WSO canopies open)\nFile:Sukhoi_Su-34_(Simulator),_Russia_-_Air_Force_AN2242851.jpg|(SU-34 pilot & WSO positions in simulator)\n</gallery>\n\n==United Kingdom==\nIn the [[Royal Air Force]], a WSO is a commissioned officer that operates aircraft mission systems formerly on the [[Tornado GR4]], however now on the [[General Atomics MQ-9 Reaper|Reaper]], [[Raytheon Sentinel|Sentinel R1]], [[Boeing RC-135|Rivet Joint]], [[Boeing E-3 Sentry|E3 Sentry]] and the [[Boeing P-8 Poseidon|P-8 Poseidon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.raf.mod.uk/recruitment/roles/roles-finder/aircrew/weapon-systems-officer|title=RAF Recruitment {{!}} Weapon Systems Officer {{!}} Royal Air Force|website=www.raf.mod.uk|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nNon-commissioned Aircrew can serve as a WSOp (Weapon Systems Operator), an umbrella term for the various specialist aircrew responsible for assisting the pilot in operating the mission systems of the aircraft (e.g. linguists, loadmasters, crewman).<ref>[http://www.raf.mod.uk/careers/jobs/weaponssystemoperator.cfm RAF - Weapon Systems Operator]</ref>\n\n==United States==\n===Overview===\n====U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps====\nIn the [[United States Navy]], WSOs are [[naval flight officer]]s responsible for manning the weapon systems of the [[Boeing F/A-18E/F Super Hornet|F/A-18F Super Hornet]] [[Fighter aircraft|strike fighter]] from that jet's aft seat.  Prior to the introduction of the F/A-18F, they were known as Radar Intercept Officers (RIO) in the aft seats of the [[F-4 Phantom II]] and [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14 Tomcat]]; as Bombardier/Navigators (B/N) in the right seat of the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6 Intruder]] and the [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3 Skywarrior]] and in the aft seat in the [[North American A-5 Vigilante|A-5 Vigilante]]; and Reconnaissance Attack Navigators (RAN) in the aft seat of the [[A-5 Vigilante|RA-5C Vigilante]].\n\nIn the [[United States Marine Corps]], \"WSO\" refers to [[naval flight officer]]s serving as the aft crew member of the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18D Hornet]].  Prior to the introduction of the F/A-18D, they also served as Radar Intercept Officers (RIO) in the aft seat of the [[F-4 Phantom II]], Reconnaissance Systems Officers (RSO) in the aft seat of reconnaissance aircraft such as the [[F-4 Phantom II|RF-4B Phantom II]] and as Bombardier/Navigators (B/N) in the right seat of the A-6 Intruder. Until mid-2019, the Marines also employed Naval Flight Officers in the [[Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler|EA-6B Prowler]], where they were known as Electronic Countermeasures Officers (ECMO, pronounced \u201cEK-mo\u201d).\n\nIn U.S. Naval Aviation ([[USN]] & [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]]), when designated as the mission commander (MC), the WSO is responsible for all phases of the assigned mission, especially if there are multiple aircraft involved.  For example, the aircraft pilot could be the junior member of a flight crew such as a USN lieutenant, junior grade/USMC 1st lieutenant or USN lieutenant/USMC captain, and the weapon systems officer could be a senior officer such as a USN lieutenant commander, commander or captain, or a USMC major, lieutenant colonel, or colonel; this would likely make the WSO the mission commander.\n\n====U.S. Air Force====\nIn the [[U.S. Air Force]], \"WSO\" also refers to a USAF [[combat systems officer]] (CSO, formerly USAF navigator) who is the aft crew member in the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15E Strike Eagle]]. In the B-52, the CSO crew members on the lower deck of the aircraft who were previously designated as navigator and radar navigator (bombardier) are now known as weapon systems officers while the CSO on the upper deck is an electronic warfare officer. In the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B Lancer]] bomber, there are 2 weapon systems officers manning crew positions aft of the pilot and co-pilot. They are known as the Offensive Systems Officer (OSO), and the Defensive Systems Officer (DSO).  WSOs also flew in the now-retired [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111]] Aardvark strike bomber, flown by the [[US Air Force]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]], and the now retired USAF [[General Dynamics\u2013Grumman EF-111A Raven|EF-111A]] Raven airborne jammer. In the F-111, the WSO (EWO in the EF-111) was seated directly to the right of the pilot/aircraft commander. The WSO integrates with the [[Aviator|pilot]] to collectively achieve and maintain crew efficiency, situational awareness and mission effectiveness. In the U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft such as the F-15E Strike Eagle, the WSO can pilot the aircraft when required, although this is typically during non-tactical portions of the mission (e.g., en route to mission area or returning to base). When designated as the mission commander (MC), the WSO is also responsible for all phases of the assigned mission, especially if there are multiple aircraft involved.  For example, the aircraft pilot could be the junior member of a flight crew such as a first lieutenant or captain, and the weapon systems officer could be a senior officer such as a major, lieutenant colonel, or colonel; regardless of rank, the WSO would be the mission commander if he/she is qualified.\n\n===Training===\nCurrently, all USN WSOs begin their training as student naval flight officers (SNFO) at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]]. Training begins with Introductory Flight Screening, where the WSO flies a [[Cessna 172]] or [[Piper PA-28]] variant to show he/she is competent enough in aviation to continue the rigorous training ahead.  Then the SNFO starts the U.S. Navy indoctrination course called Aviation Preflight Indoctrination (API) with his/her student [[naval aviator]] (pilot) counterparts.  After six weeks of ground school and basic water survival training during API, future SWSOs (Student WSOs), at that point known as student naval flight officers (SNFO) check into the primary Training Squadron for SNFOs, the [[VT-10]] Wildcats.\n\n====Primary====\nTraining begins with several weeks of ground school followed by remnants of the \"super-fo\" program from the U.S. Navy where the SNFO takes front seat of the new [[Beechcraft T-6 Texan II|T-6 Texan II]] for six \"contact\" flights where the student will become familiar with the T-6. The SNFO is treated like a pilot training student for these six flights. After Contacts, the SNFO goes back to academics to learn [[Instrument flight rules|instrument flying rules]]. Primary ends with a final instrument checkride. After primary the SNFO is compared to his or her shipmates and selected for either land-based naval aircraft or tailhook aircraft. Those SNFOs destined for the carrier-based [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C or E-2D Hawkeye]] will be known as air control officers and combat information center officers, while those destined for the EA-18G Growler (USN only) will be electronic warfare officers (EWO). Those destined for the F/A-18F Super Hornet (USN Only) or the F/A-18D Hornet (USMC only) will become WSOs.\n\n====Intermediate====\nIntermediate picks up where Primary ends for USAF SWSOs. After the instrument phase of training, students move to visual navigation (VNAV) \"low levels\" at 2000'AGL, and finish in the T-6 with a final training block called \"forms\" (formation flying). Forms consist of four flights of learning the basics of close in formation flying. After forms, SWSOs head back to ground school to learn an entirely new aircraft, the USN [[North American Sabreliner|T-39 Sabreliner]]. The T-39 is used as an intermediate instrument and low-level trainer for SWSOs, where they receive a total of eight flights. Students are required to learn the aircraft in a two-week ground school period before they go flight side. In contrast, T-6 ground school is four weeks. Training ends at either VT-10 or VT-4 with the \"i-grad\" ceremony and top graduate award.\n\n====Advanced====\nVT-86 is where all the training comes together to culminate in the SWSO receiving his or her wings of gold. In the T-39, a USN twin-engine jet trainer, SWSOs learn advanced instrument flying, radar navigation (consisting of navigating using an A/G radar from early F-16s), and composite visual/radar navigation. Training takes place on both VR and IR routes that criss-cross the south east United States. After A/G training, track selection takes place. Navy SWSOs select either the F/A-18F Super Hornet, or the E/A-18 Growler. Marine SWSOs by default select the F/A-18D Hornet. The final three months of some of the hardest training at Pensacola will leave the SWSO F/A-18 selectee with their wings of gold. Air Force WSOs no longer train at VT-86.\n\n====Graduate training====\nFollowing the winging ceremony, USN and USMC WSOs will proceed to a Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) and USAF WSOs to a Formal Training Unit (FTU) to complete advanced ground school and flight training to prepare them for their \"operational\" combat aircraft in the deployable operating forces.\n\n'''Parachuting water survival'''<br />\nAll USAF aviators with parachutes on the aircraft attend this three-day course at NAS Pensacola, Florida. During the course, USAF WSOs learn the basics of surviving an aircraft ejection over water, obtaining food and drinkable water when stranded at sea, combat evasion at sea, and how to be successfully rescued by boat or helicopter. For USN and USMC WSOs, this program was previously completed at NAS Pensacola during their Aviation Preflight Indoctrination (API) training.\n\n'''Centrifuge training'''<br />\nThis one-day course located at [[Brooks City-Base]], San Antonio, Texas, tests USAF WSOs selected for the F-15E in their ability to withstand the [[g-force]]s routinely experienced by fighter aircrew.\n\n'''SERE'''<br />\nThe [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]] (SERE) training course trains all USAF aircrew basic survival skills, combat evasion, and techniques to resist exploitation if captured. WSOs also learn how to survive an aircraft ejection over land. For USAF personnel, the three-week course is taught at [[Fairchild Air Force Base]], Washington and the surrounding areas. The counterpart course for USN and USMC WSOs is taught at [[NAS North Island]] (academics) and [[Warner Springs, California]] (field exercise) for Pacific Fleet personnel and at Brunswick, Maine for Atlantic Fleet personnel.\n\n'''IFF'''<br />\nUSAF WSOs selected for the F-15E learn [[basic fighter maneuvers]] (BFM) and surface attack in the [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38C]] at '''Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals''' (IFF). WSOs complete this training at either the [[435th Fighter Training Squadron]] at [[Randolph Air Force Base]], Texas or the [[49th Fighter Training Squadron]] at [[Columbus Air Force Base]], Mississippi. WSOs also learn about the culture of being a young aircrew member in a USAF fighter squadron. The course lasts approximately eight weeks.\n\n'''EWO'''<br />\nUSAF WSOs selected for the B-1B, [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]], and some F-15E selectees will become [[electronic warfare officer]]s (EWOs) by attending this 12-week training program at the [[563d Flying Training Squadron]] at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. A similar program for USN EWOs in the EA-18G and USMC ECMOs in the EA-6B is conducted at the '''Center for Information Dominance''' at [[Corry Station]], Florida. In both programs, students learn the basics of radar theory, electronic attack, and electronic defense.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|Aviation}}\n\n* [[Aircrew]] (Flight crew)\n* [[Combat Systems Officer]]\n* [[Naval Flight Officer]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104500/b-1b-lancer/ Factsheet B-1B Lancer]\n*[https://www.boeing.com/defense/b-1b-bomber/ Factsheet B-1B Lancer, Boeing]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20030802043924/http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=102 Factsheet F-15E Strike Eagle]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070328164103/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/fa18/index.htm F/A-18 C/D Fact Sheet]\n\n[[Category:Military aviation occupations]]\n[[Category:United States Air Force specialisms]]\n[[Category:United States Navy job titles]]\n", "name_user": "Stizanley", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added link for \"tanker\" in page photo to clarify that it is an Aerial refueling tanker aircraft, rather than one aboad a ship.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_systems_officer"}

He signed for [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] in 1997 after a successful trial with the club, and played in the [[English Football League|Football League]] and later the [[National League (English football)|Football Conference]]. After making over 100 appearances for City, and winning the [[Conference League Cup]] in 2001, he was allowed to leave in early 2003. After 18 months with [[Leigh Genesis F.C.|Leigh RMI]], he played for a host of [[Non-League football|non-league]] clubs including [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]], [[Stalybridge Celtic F.C.|Stalybridge Celtic]], and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]].\n\nLancaster moved to the United States in 2005, initially to coach at a high school, but soon got the chance to play competitively again. After an unsuccessful trial with the [[Atlanta Silverbacks FC|Atlanta Silverbacks]], he signed for [[USL Second Division]] club [[Wilmington Hammerheads FC|Wilmington Hammerheads]] in 2006. He impressed in his season with Wilmington and moved up a division to sign for the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2007. He had two successful seasons with Atlanta, including being runner-up in the [[USL First Division]] in his debut season, but the club went on hiatus in late 2008 so he was forced to move on. He moved back to the United Kingdom in early 2009 to join [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]]. He spent six months with Queens before being released at the end of the season. He signed for Swedish club [[Ljungskile SK|Ljungskile]] in the summer of 2009, and despite winning the DM Cup, his tenure was short with the [[Superettan]] side.\n\nIn 2010, Lancaster moved back to the United States, signing for [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Miami FC]] who later change their name to the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] in 2011. He spent two years with Fort Lauderdale, being runner-up in [[Soccer Bowl 2011]], in what were his final appearances for the club. He returned to the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2012, who were now competing in the [[North American Soccer League]]. He was a key player in his second spell with Atlanta, becoming club captain, and leading the club to [[Soccer Bowl 2013]] despite not playing in the championship game itself. After a short spell with [[National Premier Soccer League]] club [[Georgia Revolution FC|Georgia Revolution]] in 2014, he retired from competitive football.\n\n==Early life==\n\nLancaster was born in [[Higher End|Billinge]], Greater Manchester.

football)|defender]]. He signed for [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] in 1997 after a successful trial with the club, and played in the [[English Football League|Football League]] and later the [[National League (English football)|Football Conference]]. After making over 100 appearances for City, and winning the [[Conference League Cup]] in 2001, he was allowed to leave in early 2003. After 18 months with [[Leigh Genesis F.C.|Leigh RMI]], he played for a host of [[Non-League football|non-league]] clubs including [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]], [[Stalybridge Celtic F.C.|Stalybridge Celtic]], and [[Southport F.C.|Southport]].\n\nLancaster moved to the United States in 2005, initially to coach at a high school, but soon got the chance to play competitively again. After an unsuccessful trial with the [[Atlanta Silverbacks FC|Atlanta Silverbacks]], he signed for [[USL Second Division]] club [[Wilmington Hammerheads FC|Wilmington Hammerheads]] in 2006. He impressed in his season with Wilmington and moved up a division to sign for the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2007. He had two successful seasons with Atlanta, including being runner-up in the [[USL First Division]] in his debut season, but the club went on hiatus in late 2008 so he was forced to move on. He moved back to the United Kingdom in early 2009 to join [[Scottish Football League First Division|Scottish First Division]] club [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]]. He spent six months with Queens before being released at the end of the season. He signed for Swedish club [[Ljungskile SK|Ljungskile]] in the summer of 2009, and despite winning the DM Cup, his tenure was short with the [[Superettan]] side.\n\nIn 2010, Lancaster moved back to the United States, signing for [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Miami FC]] who later change their name to the [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Fort Lauderdale Strikers]] in 2011. He spent two years with Fort Lauderdale, being runner-up in [[Soccer Bowl 2011]], in what were his final appearances for the club. He returned to the Atlanta Silverbacks in 2012, who were now competing in the [[North American Soccer League]]. He was a key player in his second spell with Atlanta, becoming club captain, and leading the club to [[Soccer Bowl 2013]] despite not playing in the championship game itself. After a short spell with [[National Premier Soccer League]] club [[Georgia Revolution FC|Georgia Revolution]] in 2014, he retired from competitive football.\n\n==Early life==\n\nLancaster was born in [[Higher End|Billinge]], Greater Manchester.

{"title_page": "African humid period", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{Short description|Holocene climate period during which northern Africa was wetter than today}}\n[[File:Sahara satellite hires.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|The Sahara was not a [[Hot desert|desert]] during the African humid period. Instead, most of northern Africa was covered by grass, trees, and lakes.]]\nThe '''African humid period''' (AHP) is a climate period in Africa during the late [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]] geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by[gras]es, trees and lakes was caused by changes in [[Earth's orbit|Earth's orbit around the Sun]]; changes in vegetation and dust in the [[Sahara]] which strengthened the [[African monsoon]]; and increased [[greenhouse gas]]es, which may imply that [[anthropogenic global warming]] will also result in a shrinkage of the Sahara desert.\n\nDuring the preceding [[last glacial maximum]], the Sahara contained extensive [[dune]] fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, but its lakes and rivers such as [[Lake Victoria]] and the [[White Nile]] were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600\u201314,500 years ago at the end of [[Heinrich event|Heinrich event 1]], simultaneously to the [[B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d warming]]. Rivers and lakes such as [[Lake Chad]] formed or expanded, [[glacier]]s grew on [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the [[Younger Dryas]] and and the short [[8.2 kiloyear event]]. The African humid period ended 6,000\u20135,000 years ago during the [[Piora Oscillation]] cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the [[Sahel]], Arabia and East Africa the period appears to have taken place in several steps such as the [[4.2 kiloyear event]].\n\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Deserts, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic civilization]]. They lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s until the [[First Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]], domesticating animals, leaving [[archeological site]]s and artifacts such as one of the [[Dufuna canoe|oldest ships in the world]], and [[rock painting]]s such as those in the [[Cave of Swimmers]] and in the [[Acacus Mountains]]. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the [[Nile Valley]] and [[Mesopotamia]], where they gave rise to early complex societies.\n\n== Research history ==\n\n[[Herodotus]] in 440 [[Before Christ|BC]] and [[Strabon]] in 23 [[AD]] discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher [[Heinrich Barth]] discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering [[petroglyph]]s in the [[Murzuq Desert]], and further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy]] to coin the concept of a ''[[Green Sahara]]'' in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes<ref name=\"Bader2017\" />{{sfn|Hoelzmann|Holmes|2017|p=3}} and higher [[Nile]] flow levels was increasingly reported{{sfn|McCool|2019|p=5}} and it was recognized that the [[Holocene]] featured a humid period in the Sahara.{{sfn|Dawelbeit|Jaillard|Eisawi|2019|p=12}}\n\nThe idea that changes in Earth's orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such [[orbit]]al controls on climate was found.<ref name=\"Bader2017\" /> At first it was believed that humid periods in Africa correlate with glacial stages (\"[[pluvial hypothesis]]\") before [[radiocarbon dating]] became widespread.{{sfn|Wendorf|Karl\u00e9n|Schild|2007|p=190}}\n\nThe development and existence of the African humid period has been investigated with [[archeology]], [[climate model]]ling and [[paleoproxies]],{{sfn|Timm|K\u00f6hler|Timmermann|Menviel|2010|p=2612}} with [[archeological site]]s,{{sfn|Hoelzmann|Keding|Berke|Kr\u00f6pelin|2001|p=193}} [[dune]]s and deposits left by lakes, the sea and wetlands playing an important role.{{sfn|Hoelzmann|Holmes|2017|p=3}} [[Pollen]], lake deposits and former levels of lakes have been used to study the ecosystems of the

the humid period for good.{{sfn|Brooks|Chiapello|Lernia|Drake|2007|p=257}}\n* In [[climate model]]s, increased snow and ice on the [[Tibetan Plateau]] can lead to a weakening of the Indian and African monsoons, with the weakening of the former preceding that of the latter by 1,500\u20132,000 years.{{sfn|Ganopolski|Chen|Peng|Jin|2009|p=466}} There is evidence that [[glacier]]s in [[Tibet]] such as

temperature changes in the [[Gulf of Guinea]] at the critical time that might explain the end of the AHP.{{sfn|Schefu\u00df|Roche|Skonieczny|Mulitza|2017|p=7}}\n* Additional feedback processes may have included the drying of soils and loss of vegetation after decreased rainfall,{{sfn|Menocal|2015|p=1}} which would have led to wind-driven [[deflation]] of the soils.{{sfn|Menocal|2015|p=2}}\n* An expansion of [[sea ice]] around [[Antarctica]] about 5,000 calibrated years ago may have provided another positive feedback.{{sfn|Guilderson|Charles|Crosta|Shemesh|2001|p=197}}\n* The expanding dry

parts of [[Italy]].{{sfn|Vincenzo|Massimo|2015|p=13}} \n* High latitude climate changes have been proposed as a cause for the end of the AHP. Specifically, about 6,000\u20135,000 years ago the [[Arctic]] became colder, with [[sea ice]] expanding, temperatures in Europe and off Northern Africa decreasing and the [[Atlantic meridional overturning circulation]] weakening.{{sfn|Schefu\u00df|Roche|Skonieczny|Mulitza|2017|p=7}} This cooling tendency may have weakened the [[Tropical Easterly Jet]] and thus reduced the amount of precipitation falling over Africa.{{sfn|Schefu\u00df|Roche|Skonieczny|Mulitza|2017|p=9}}\n\nThe orbitally-induced changes of precipitation may have been modified by the [[solar cycle]]; specifically, solar activity maxima during the ending phase of the AHP may have offset the orbital effect and thus stabilized precipitation levels, while solar activity minima compounded the orbital effects and thus induced rapid decreases in lake water levels of [[Lake Turkana]].{{sfn|Schuster|Nutz|2016|p=1616}} At Lake Victoria on the other hand, solar variations appear to sometimes lead to drough and

today}}\n[[File:Sahara satellite hires.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|The Sahara was not a [[Hot desert|desert]] during the African humid period. Instead, most of northern Africa was covered by grass, trees, and lakes.]]\nThe '''African humid period''' (AHP) is a climate period in Africa during the late [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]] geologic epochs, when northern Africa was wetter than today. The covering of much of the Sahara desert by[gras]es, trees and lakes was caused by changes in [[Earth's orbit|Earth's orbit around the Sun]]; changes in vegetation and dust in the [[Sahara]] which strengthened the [[African monsoon]]; and increased [[greenhouse gas]]es, which may imply that [[anthropogenic global warming]] will also result in a shrinkage of the Sahara desert.\n\nDuring the preceding [[last glacial maximum]], the Sahara contained extensive [[dune]] fields and was mostly uninhabited. It was much larger than today, but its lakes and rivers such as [[Lake Victoria]] and the [[White Nile]] were either dry or at low levels. The humid period began about 14,600\u201314,500 years ago at the end of [[Heinrich event|Heinrich event 1]], simultaneously to the [[B\u00f8lling-Aller\u00f8d warming]]. Rivers and lakes such as [[Lake Chad]] formed or expanded, [[glacier]]s grew on [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] and the Sahara retreated. Two major dry fluctuations occurred; during the [[Younger Dryas]] and and the short [[8.2 kiloyear event]]. The African humid period ended 6,000\u20135,000 years ago during the [[Piora Oscillation]] cold period. While some evidence points to an end 5,500 years ago, in the [[Sahel]], Arabia and East Africa the period appears to have taken place in several steps such as the [[4.2 kiloyear event]].\n\nThe AHP led to a widespread settlement of the Sahara and the Arabian Deserts, and had a profound effect on African cultures, such as the birth of the [[Ancient Egypt|Pharaonic civilization]]. They lived as [[hunter-gatherer]]s until the [[First Agricultural Revolution|agricultural revolution]], domesticating animals, leaving [[archeological site]]s and artifacts such as one of the [[Dufuna canoe|oldest ships in the world]], and [[rock painting]]s such as those in the [[Cave of Swimmers]] and in the [[Acacus Mountains]]. Earlier humid periods in Africa were postulated after the discovery of these rock paintings in now-inhospitable parts of the Sahara. When the period ended, humans gradually abandoned the desert in favour of regions with more secure water supplies, such as the [[Nile Valley]] and [[Mesopotamia]], where they gave rise to early complex societies.\n\n== Research history ==\n\n[[Herodotus]] in 440 [[Before Christ|BC]] and [[Strabon]] in 23 [[AD]] discussed the existence of a greener Sahara, although their reports were at first questioned owing to their anecdotal nature. In 1850 the researcher [[Heinrich Barth]] discussed the possibility of past climate change leading to increased wetness in the Sahara after discovering [[petroglyph]]s in the [[Murzuq Desert]], and further discoveries of petroglyphs led desert explorer [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Alm\u00e1sy]] to coin the concept of a ''[[Green Sahara]]'' in the 1930s. Later in the 20th century, conclusive evidence of a past greener Sahara, the existence of lakes<ref name=\"Bader2017\" />{{sfn|Hoelzmann|Holmes|2017|p=3}} and higher [[Nile]] flow levels was increasingly reported{{sfn|McCool|2019|p=5}} and it was recognized that the [[Holocene]] featured a humid period in the Sahara.{{sfn|Dawelbeit|Jaillard|Eisawi|2019|p=12}}\n\nThe idea that changes in Earth's orbit around the Sun influence the strength of the monsoons was already advanced in 1921, and while the original description was partly inaccurate, later widespread evidence for such

monsoons, with the weakening of the former preceding that of the latter by 1,500\u20132,000 years.{{sfn|Ganopolski|Chen|Peng|Jin|2009|p=466}} There is evidence that [[glacier]]s in [[Tibet]] such as

have included the drying of soils and loss of vegetation after decreased rainfall,{{sfn|Menocal|2015|p=1}} which would have led to wind-driven [[deflation]] of the soils.{{sfn|Menocal|2015|p=2}}\n* An expansion of [[sea ice]] around [[Antarctica]] about 5,000 calibrated years ago may have provided another positive feedback.{{sfn|Guilderson|Charles|Crosta|Shemesh|2001|p=197}}\n* The expanding dry

Specifically, about 6,000\u20135,000 years ago the [[Arctic]] became colder, with [[sea ice]] expanding, temperatures in Europe and off Northern Africa decreasing and the [[Atlantic meridional overturning circulation]] weakening.{{sfn|Schefu\u00df|Roche|Skonieczny|Mulitza|2017|p=7}} This cooling tendency may have weakened the [[Tropical Easterly Jet]] and thus reduced the amount of precipitation falling over Africa.{{sfn|Schefu\u00df|Roche|Skonieczny|Mulitza|2017|p=9}}\n\nThe orbitally-induced changes of precipitation may have been modified by the [[solar cycle]]; specifically, solar activity maxima during the ending phase of the AHP may have offset the orbital effect and thus stabilized precipitation levels, while solar activity minima compounded the orbital effects and thus induced rapid decreases in lake water levels of [[Lake Turkana]].{{sfn|Schuster|Nutz|2016|p=1616}} At Lake Victoria on the other hand, solar variations appear to sometimes lead to drough and
