Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon, also known as god by the community at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began its ongoing serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow, Akira Otoishi. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters.

Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

[[county-level city]] in Northwestern [[Xinjiang]], People's Republic of China and the seat of the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]]. Historically, Yining is the successor to the ruined city of [[Almaliq, Xinjiang|Almaliq]] in neighbouring [[Huocheng County]]. Yining is the third largest city in Xinjiang after [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]] and [[Korla]].\n\n== Area and population ==\nThe city of Yining is a county-level administrative unit located along [[Ili River]]. As of 2015, it has an estimated population of 542,507, with a total land area of {{convert|629|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |title = Yining: Bulletin for economical and social development in 2015 |url = http://www.ahmhxc.com/tongjigongbao/3275_4.html |accessdate = 20 April 2016}}</ref> It is the most populous city in the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]].\n\nThe land area and population of the City of Yining saw an increase in 2003; the increase resulted from the transfer of two villages with some {{convert|100|km2|abbr=on}} of land from the adjacent [[Yining County]], which is a separate administrative unit from the city.\n\n== History ==\n=== Note on historical place names ===\nFrom 13-15th century it was under the control of [[Chagatai Khanate]]. Another Mongol empire&mdash;the [[Zunghar Khanate]]&mdash;established around Ili area. In the 19th and early 20th century, the word Kuldja or Ghulja was often used in Russia and in the West as the name for the entire Chinese part of the Ili River basin as well as for its two main cities. The usage of [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] is fairly characteristic: it defines '''Kulja''' as a \"territory in north-west China\" bounded by the Russian border and the mountains that surround the Ili basin, and it talks about two major cities of the region:<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri15chisrich#page/942/mode/2up \"Kulja\" in Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 1911, e.g]</ref>\n* ''Kulja''  (i.e. today's Yining), or more specifically ''Old Kulja'' (elsewhere, also called ''[[Taranchi]] Kulja''),  which was the commercial center of the region.\n* ''Suidun'' (i.e. [[Suiding]], now called [[Shuiding]]), or more specifically ''New Kulja'', ''[[Manchu]] Kulja'', or ''Ili'' (elsewhere, also ''Chinese Kulja''),  the Chinese fortress and the regional capital.\nUntil the 1860s [[Huiyuan, Xinjiang|Huiyuan]] to the south of Suiding was the regional capital.\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nThe fort of Ningyuan ({{zh|t=\u5be7\u9060\u57ce|labels=no}}) was built in 1762 to accommodate new settlers from southern [[Xinjiang]]. The forts of Huining ({{zh|t=\u60e0\u5be7\u57ce|labels=no}}) and Xichun ({{zh|t=\u7199\u6625\u57ce|labels=no}}) built later in 1765 and 1780 were also located within the modern Yining City.\n\nThe Sino-Russian [[Treaty of Kulja]] 1851 opened the area for trade.\n\nIn 1864-66, the city suffered severely from fighting during the [[Dungan Revolt (1862\u201377)|Dungan Revolt]]. The city and the rest of the Ili River basin were seized by the [[Russia]]ns in 1871 during [[Yakub Beg]]'s independent rule of [[Kashgaria]]. It was restored to the Chinese under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)]]. In 1888 the Ningyuan County was established.\n\n''The Geographical Magazine'' in 1875 by Sir Clements Robert Markham stated:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhat little industry Kulja possesses is all due to the Chinese, who transplanted the taste for art, assiduity and skilfulness of their pigtailed race, even to these western outskirts of \"the celestial flowery dominion of the Middle.\" Had the [[Taranchi|Taranjis]] and [[Oirats|Kalmuks]] been left to themselves, or had they remained in a preponderating majority, Kulja would not be a bit farther advanced than either [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] or [[Aksu Prefecture|Aksu]]. The principal trades are the following:\u2014 founders, manufacturing kettles, plates, and other implements of a very primitive form; paper-makers, whose productions do not seem to be superior to the paper manufactured at the present time after Chinese patterns at [[Khokand]] and [[Samarkand]]. There are, moreover, some confectionaries in which cakes of all shapes are baked of rice and millet, overlaid with sugar; also maccaroni-makers, the Taranjis being notoriously very fond of dried farinaceous food. In Eastern Turkistan there still exist many similar trades, and although their products are not equal to European articles of the same kind\u2014I mean here the fabrics of the formerly western Chinese provinces\u2014 they are still said to be profitable. Finally among the tradesmen we may mention millers, vinegar manufacturers and potters. The number of factories amount to-day at Kulja to 38, wherein over 131 hands are occupied. To this of course other tradespeople have to be added, such as 169 boot-makers, 50 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 11 brass-founders, 3 silversmiths, 26 stone-cutters, and 2 tailors.<ref name=\"Markham1875\">{{cite book|author=Sir Clements Robert Markham|title=The Geographical Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lo7pAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA176#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1875|publisher=Tr\u00fcbner & Company|pages=176\u2013}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nIn 1914 the Ningyuan County was renamed Yining County to avoid confusion with other places in China named [[Ningyuan (disambiguation)|Ningyuan]].\n\n=== People's Republic ===\nYining became a separate city from [[Yining County]] in 1952. In 1962, major Sino-Soviet clashes{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} took place along the [[Ili River]].\n\nIn 1997, in what came to be known as the [[Gulja Incident]] or massacre, the city was rocked by two days of demonstrations or riots<ref>\"Xinjiang to intensify crackdown on separatists\", [[China Daily]], 10/25/2001 [http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2001-10/25/content_90592.htm]</ref> followed by a government crack down resulting in at least 9 deaths following the execution of 30 [[Uyghur people|Uighur]] activists.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RUCOrg2Pb0 1997 Channel 4 UK report which can be seen here]</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:USSR map NK 44-2 I-Ning.jpg|thumb|left|Yining (labelled as I-NING (KULDJA) {{lang|zh-hant|\u4f0a\u5be7}}) (1952)]]\n{{climate chart\n| Yining (Gulja)\n| -15.0 | -2.1 | 18\n| -12.2 |   .2 | 19\n| - 2.5 |  9.0 | 20\n|   5.8 | 20.4 | 28\n|  10.2 | 24.8 | 27\n|  14.0 | 28.5 | 29\n|  15.8 | 31.0 | 20\n|  14.1 | 30.4 | 14\n|   9.3 | 25.8 | 15\n|   2.9 | 18.0 | 26\n| - 2.8 |  8.7 | 28\n| - 9.5 |  1.3 | 25\n|float = right\n|clear = none\n|source = CMA <ref name=\"CMA old\"/>\n}}\n\nYining is located on the northern side of the [[Ili River]] in the [[Dzungaria]]n basin, about {{convert|70|km|abbr=on}} east of the border with [[Kazakhstan]], and about {{convert|710|km|abbr=on}} west of [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]].

Dry and sunny weather dominates year-round. Winters are cold, with a January average of {{convert|-8.8|\u00b0C|1}}. Yet the influence of the [[Dzungarian Altau]] to the northwest and [[Boroboro Mountains]] to the northeast helps keep the city warmer than more easterly locales on a similar latitude. Summers are hot, with a July average of {{convert|23.1|\u00b0C|1}}. Diurnal temperature ranges tend to be large from April to October. The annual mean temperature is {{convert|8.98|\u00b0C|1}}.

[[county-level city]] in Northwestern [[Xinjiang]], People's Republic of China and the seat of the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]]. Historically, Yining is the successor to the ruined city of [[Almaliq, Xinjiang|Almaliq]] in neighbouring [[Huocheng County]]. Yining is the third largest city in Xinjiang after [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]] and [[Korla]].\n\n== Area and population ==\nThe city of Yining is a county-level administrative unit located along [[Ili River]]. As of 2015, it has an estimated population of 542,507, with a total land area of {{convert|629|km2|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |title = Yining: Bulletin for economical and social development in 2015 |url = http://www.ahmhxc.com/tongjigongbao/3275_4.html |accessdate = 20 April 2016}}</ref> It is the most populous city in the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]].\n\nThe land area and population of the City of Yining saw an increase in 2003; the increase resulted from the transfer of two villages with some {{convert|100|km2|abbr=on}} of land from the adjacent [[Yining County]], which is a separate administrative unit from the city.\n\n== History ==\n=== Note on historical place names ===\nFrom 13-15th century it was under the control of [[Chagatai Khanate]]. Another Mongol empire&mdash;the [[Zunghar Khanate]]&mdash;established around Ili area. In the 19th and early 20th century, the word Kuldja or Ghulja was often used in Russia and in the West as the name for the entire Chinese part of the Ili River basin as well as for its two main cities. The usage of [[1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] is fairly characteristic: it defines '''Kulja''' as a \"territory in north-west China\" bounded by the Russian border and the mountains that surround the Ili basin, and it talks about two major cities of the region:<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri15chisrich#page/942/mode/2up \"Kulja\" in Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica 1911, e.g]</ref>\n* ''Kulja''  (i.e. today's Yining), or more specifically ''Old Kulja'' (elsewhere, also called ''[[Taranchi]] Kulja''),  which was the commercial center of the region.\n* ''Suidun'' (i.e. [[Suiding]], now called [[Shuiding]]), or more specifically ''New Kulja'', ''[[Manchu]] Kulja'', or ''Ili'' (elsewhere, also ''Chinese Kulja''),  the Chinese fortress and the regional capital.\nUntil the 1860s [[Huiyuan, Xinjiang|Huiyuan]] to the south of Suiding was the regional capital.\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\nThe fort of Ningyuan ({{zh|t=\u5be7\u9060\u57ce|labels=no}}) was built in 1762 to accommodate new settlers from southern [[Xinjiang]]. The forts of Huining ({{zh|t=\u60e0\u5be7\u57ce|labels=no}}) and Xichun ({{zh|t=\u7199\u6625\u57ce|labels=no}}) built later in 1765 and 1780 were also located within the modern Yining City.\n\nThe Sino-Russian [[Treaty of Kulja]] 1851 opened the area for trade.\n\nIn 1864-66, the city suffered severely from fighting during the [[Dungan Revolt (1862\u201377)|Dungan Revolt]]. The city and the rest of the Ili River basin were seized by the [[Russia]]ns in 1871 during [[Yakub Beg]]'s independent rule of [[Kashgaria]]. It was restored to the Chinese under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881)]]. In 1888 the Ningyuan County was established.\n\n''The Geographical Magazine'' in 1875 by Sir Clements Robert Markham stated:\n\n<blockquote>\nWhat little industry Kulja possesses is all due to the Chinese, who transplanted the taste for art, assiduity and skilfulness of their pigtailed race, even to these western outskirts of \"the celestial flowery dominion of the Middle.\" Had the [[Taranchi|Taranjis]] and [[Oirats|Kalmuks]] been left to themselves, or had they remained in a preponderating majority, Kulja would not be a bit farther advanced than either [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] or [[Aksu Prefecture|Aksu]]. The principal trades are the following:\u2014 founders, manufacturing kettles, plates, and other implements of a very primitive form; paper-makers, whose productions do not seem to be superior to the paper manufactured at the present time after Chinese patterns at [[Khokand]] and [[Samarkand]]. There are, moreover, some confectionaries in which cakes of all shapes are baked of rice and millet, overlaid with sugar; also maccaroni-makers, the Taranjis being notoriously very fond of dried farinaceous food. In Eastern Turkistan there still exist many similar trades, and although their products are not equal to European articles of the same kind\u2014I mean here the fabrics of the formerly western Chinese provinces\u2014 they are still said to be profitable. Finally among the tradesmen we may mention millers, vinegar manufacturers and potters. The number of factories amount to-day at Kulja to 38, wherein over 131 hands are occupied. To this of course other tradespeople have to be added, such as 169 boot-makers, 50 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 11 brass-founders, 3 silversmiths, 26 stone-cutters, and 2 tailors.<ref name=\"Markham1875\">{{cite book|author=Sir Clements Robert Markham|title=The Geographical Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lo7pAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA176#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1875|publisher=Tr\u00fcbner & Company|pages=176\u2013}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n=== Republic of China ===\nIn 1914 the Ningyuan County was renamed Yining County to avoid confusion with other places in China named [[Ningyuan (disambiguation)|Ningyuan]].\n\n=== People's Republic ===\nYining became a separate city from [[Yining County]] in 1952.

When ''X \u2297 Y'' is endowed with this topology then it is denoted by <math>X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y</math> and called the '''projective tensor product''' of ''X'' and ''Y''. \n\n== Preliminaries ==\n\n=== A canonical tensor product as a subspace of the dual of Bi(X, Y) ===\nLet ''X'' and ''Y'' be vector spaces (no topology is needed yet) and let ''Bi(X, Y)'' be the space of all [[bilinear map]]s defined on <math>X \\times Y</math> and going into the underlying scalar field. \n\nFor every <math>(x, y) \\in X \\times Y</math> define a canonical bilinear form by <math>\\chi_{(x, y)}</math> with domain ''Bi(X, Y)'' by <math>\\chi_{(x, y)}(u) := u(x, y)</math> for every <math>u \\in Bi(X, Y)</math>. \nThis induces a canonical map <math>\\chi : X \\times Y \\to Bi(X, Y)^{\\#}</math> defined by <math>\\chi(x, y) = \\chi_{(x, y)}</math>, where <math>Bi(X, Y)^{\\#}</math> denotes the [[algebraic dual]] of ''Bi(X, Y)''.  \nIf we denote the span of the range of ''\ud835\udf12'' by ''X \u2297 Y'' then ''X \u2297 Y'' together with ''\ud835\udf12'' forms a [[tensor product]] of ''X'' and ''Y'' (where ''x \u2297 y = \ud835\udf12(x, y)''). This gives us a canonical tensor product of ''X'' and ''Y''. \n\nIf ''Z'' is any other vector space then the mapping <math>Li(X \\otimes Y; Z) \\to Bi(X, Y; Z)</math> given by <math>u \\mapsto u \\circ \\chi</math> is an isomorphism of vector spaces. In particular, this allows us to identify the [[algebraic dual]] of ''X \u2297 Y'' with the space of bilinear forms on <math>X \\times Y</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=92}} Moreover, if ''X'' and ''Y'' are locally convex [[Topological Vector Space]]s (TVSs) and if ''X \u2297 Y'' is given the \ud835\udf0b-topology then for every locally convex TVS ''Z'', this map restricts to a vector space isomorphism <math>L(X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y; Z) \\to B(X, Y; Z)</math> from the space of ''continuous'' linear mappings onto the space of ''continuous'' bilinear mappings.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}} In particular, the continuous dual of ''X \u2297 Y'' can be canonically identified with the space ''B(X, Y)'' of continuous bilinear forms on <math>X \\times Y</math>; furthermore, under this identification the [[equicontinuous]] subsets of ''B(X, Y)'' are the same as the equicontinuous subsets of ''<math>(X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y)^{\\prime}</math>.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}}\n\n== The projective tensor product ==\n=== Tensor product of seminorms ===\nThroughout we will let ''X'' and ''Y'' be [[locally convex]] [[topological vector spaces]] (local convexity allows us to define useful topologies{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=93}}). \nIf ''p'' is a seminorm on ''X'' then <math>C_p := \\{ x \\in X : p(x) \\leq 1 \\}</math> will be its closed unit ball. \n\nIf ''p'' is a seminorm on ''X'' and ''q'' is a seminorm on ''Y'' then we can define the '''tensor product of ''p'' and ''q''''' to be the map ''p \u2297 q'' defined on ''X \u2297 Y'' by \n: <math>(p \\otimes q)(b) := \\inf_{r > 0, b \\in r W} r</math>\nwhere ''W'' is the [[balanced]] convex hull of <math>C_p \\otimes C_q = \\left\\{ x \\otimes y : p(x) \\leq 1, q(y) \\leq 1 \\right\\}</math>. \nGiven ''b'' in ''X \u2297 Y'', this can also be expressed as{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=435}}\n: <math>(p \\otimes q)(b) := \\inf \\sum_i p(x_i) q(y_i)</math>\nwhere the infimum is taken over all finite sequences <math>x_1, \\ldots, x_n \\in X</math> and <math>y_1, \\ldots, y_n \\in Y</math> (of the same length) such that <math>b = x_1 \\otimes y_1 + \\cdots + x_n \\otimes y_n</math> (recall that it may not be possible to express ''b'' as a [[simple tensor]]). \nIf ''b = x\u2297y'' then we have\n: <math>(p \\otimes q)(x \\otimes y) = p(x) q(y)</math>.\nThe seminorm ''p \u2297 q'' is a norm if and only if both ''p'' and ''q'' are norms.{{sfn | Treves | 2006 | p=437}} \n\nIf the topology of ''X'' (resp.

In particular, if <math>u : X_1 \\to Y_1</math> and <math>v : X_2 \\to Y_2</math> are continuous linear maps between locally convex spaces then their tensor product <math>u \\otimes v : X_1 \\otimes_{\\pi} X_2 \\to Y_1 \\otimes_{\\pi} Y_2 \\subseteq Y_1 \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y_2</math>, which is necessarily continuous, can be extended to a unique continuous linear function <math>u \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} v : X_1 \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} X_2 \\to Y_1 \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y_2</math>, which may also be denoted by <math>u \\widehat{\\otimes} v</math> if no ambiguity would arise. \n\nNote that if ''X'' and ''Y'' are metrizable then so are <math>X \\otimes_{\\pi} Y</math> and <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math>, where in particular <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math> will be an [[F-space]]. \n\n=== Grothendieck's representation of elements of <math>X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math> ===\n\nRecall that in a Hausdorff locally convex space ''X'', a sequence <math>\\left( x_i \\right)_{i=1}^{\\infty}</math> in ''X'' is '''absolutely convergent''' if <math>\\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} p \\left( x_i \\right) < \\infty</math> for every continuous seminorm ''p'' on ''X''.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=120}} We write <math>x = \\sum_{i=1}^{\\infty} x_i</math> if the sequence of partial sums <math>\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \\right)_{n=1}^{\\infty}</math> converges to ''x'' in ''X''.{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=120}} \n\nThe following fundamental result in the theory of topological tensor products is due to [[Alexander Grothendieck]].{{sfn | Schaefer | 1999 | p=94}} \n\n'''Theorem''' Let ''X'' and ''Y'' be metrizable locally convex TVSs and let <math>z \\in X \\widehat{\\otimes}_{\\pi} Y</math>.
