[https://books.google.com/books?id=lpDTIUklB2MC&pg=PA45] Estimates of the death toll of non-Jewish victims vary by millions, partly because the boundary between death by persecution and death by starvation and other means in a context of [[total war]] is unclear. Overall, about 5.7 million (78 percent) of the 7.3 million Jews in occupied Europe perished ([[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Atlas of the Holocaust'' 1988, pp. 242-244).

The word \"holocaust\" was later adopted in Greek translations of the Torah to refer to the [[Korban Olah|olah]],<ref>''Olah'' (Leviticus 1:1-17) lit.: 'what goes up', \".. i.e goes up in smoke, because the entire animal, except for its hide, was burned on the altar. Other types of sacrifice were consumed in part by fire .. In English, olah has for centuries been translated 'burnt offering.\" The olah had a high degree of sanctity, and it was regarded as the 'standard' sacrifice. .. In contrast, sacrifices made by the Greeks to the Olympian gods were always shared by the worshipers; only sacrifices made to the dread underground deities to ward off evil were presented as holocausts, i.e., completely burned.\" W.

As this occurred in a church, it could be seen as a religious offering.

With reference to the events of the war, writers in English from 1945 used the term in relation to events such as the fire-bombing of [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden]] or [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]], or [[Nuclear holocaust|the effects of a nuclear war]], although from the 1950s onwards, it was increasingly used in English to refer to the Nazi genocide of the European Jews (or Judeocide).\n\nBy the late 1950s, documents translated from Hebrew sometimes used the word \"Holocaust\" to translate \"Shoah\", as the Judeocide. This use can be found as early as May 23, 1943, in ''The New York Times'', on page E6, in an article by Julian Meltzer, referring to feelings in Palestine about Jewish immigration of refugees from \"the Nazi holocaust.\"\n\nOne significant early use was in a 1958 recollection by [[Leslie Hardman]], the first Jewish British Army Chaplain to enter [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] in April 1945, where he ministered to survivors and supervised the burial of about 20,000 victims,\n\n<blockquote>Towards me came what seemed to be the remnants of a holocaust \u2013 a staggering mass of blackened skin and bones, held together somehow with filthy rags. 'My God, the dead walk', I cried aloud, but I did not recognise my voice... [peering] at the double star, the emblem of Jewry on my tunic - one poor creature touched and then stroked the badge of my faith, and finding that it was real murmured, 'Rabbiner, Rabbiner'.<ref>Hardman, Leslie and Cecily Goodman 'The Survivors: the story of the Belsen Remnant' London: Vallentine, Mitchell,(1958)</ref></blockquote>\n\nBy the late 1960s, the term was starting to be used in this sense without qualification. [[Nora Levin]]'s 1968 book ''The Holocaust: The Destruction of European Jewry, 1933-1945'' explains the meaning in its subtitle, but uses the unmoderated phrase \"The Holocaust\". An article called \"Moral Trauma and the Holocaust\" was published in the ''New York Times'' on February 12, 1968.<ref>page 37, by Eliot Fremont-Smith</ref> However, it was not until the late 1970s that the Nazi genocide became the generally accepted conventional meaning of the word, when used unqualified and with a capital letter, a usage that also spread to other languages for the same period.<ref>Harnessing the Holocaust: The Politics of Memory in France, ''Jewish Quarterly Review'', Volume 96, Number 2, Spring 2006, pp. 304-306</ref> The 1978 television miniseries titled \"[[Holocaust (miniseries)|Holocaust]]\" and starring [[Meryl Streep]] is often cited as the principal contributor to establishing the current usage in the wider culture.<ref>Garaudy, Roger, \"The Mythical Foundations of Israeli Policy\", ''Studies Forum International'', London 1997, p.133</ref> \"Holocaust\" was selected as the [[Gesellschaft f\u00fcr deutsche Sprache|Association for the German Language]]'s [[Word of the year (Germany)|Word of the Year]] in 1979, reflecting increased public consciousness of the term.\n\nThe Hebrew word ''Shoah'' is preferred by some people due to the supposed theologically and historically unacceptable nature of the word \"holocaust\".<ref>\"It is the rejection of even the hint of such sacrificial thinking that prompts some Jews to refuse to refer to the events of the Shoah as a 'holocaust', the burnt offering with smoke wafting up to heaven\".

With reference to the events of the war, writers in English from 1945 used the term in relation to events such as the fire-bombing of [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|Dresden]] or [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Hiroshima]], or [[Nuclear holocaust|the effects of a nuclear war]], although from the 1950s onwards, it was increasingly used in English to refer to the Nazi genocide of the European Jews (or Judeocide).\n\nBy the late 1950s, documents translated from Hebrew sometimes used the word \"Holocaust\" to translate \"Shoah\", as the Judeocide. This use can be found as early as May 23, 1943, in ''The New York Times'', on page E6, in an article by Julian Meltzer, referring to feelings in Palestine about Jewish immigration of refugees from \"the Nazi holocaust.\"\n\nOne significant early use was in a 1958 recollection by [[Leslie Hardman]], the first Jewish British Army Chaplain to enter [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]] in April 1945, where he ministered to survivors and supervised the burial of about 20,000 victims,\n\n<blockquote>Towards me came what seemed to be the remnants of a holocaust \u2013 a staggering mass of blackened skin and bones, held together somehow with filthy rags.

The writer has been told that Pi's life story would be a good subject for a book. Pi tells the writer the following story about his life:\n\nPi's father names him Piscine Molitor Patel after [[Piscine Molitor|the swimming pool in France]]. In secondary school in [[Pondicherry]], he adopts the name \"[[Pi]]\" (the Greek letter, {{pi}}) to avoid the [[Homophone|sound-alike]] nickname \"Pissing Patel\". He is raised in a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] family, but at 12 years old, is introduced to [[Catholic Christianity|Christianity]] and then [[Islam]], and decides to follow all three religions as he \"just wants to love God\". His mother supports his desire to grow, but his rationalist father tries to secularize him. Pi's family owns a zoo, and Pi takes interest in the animals, especially a [[Bengal tiger]] named [[Life of Pi#Richard Parker|Richard Parker]]. After Pi gets dangerously close to Richard Parker, his father forces him to witness the tiger killing a goat.\n\nWhen Pi is 16, his father announces that they must move to Canada, where he intends to settle and sell the animals. The family books passage with the animals on a Japanese freighter; Pi bids farewell to his girlfriend Anandi, both promising to reunite in the future. During a storm, the ship [[Shipwrecking|founders]] while Pi is on deck. He tries to find his family, but a crewman throws him into a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]. A freed [[zebra]] jumps onto the boat with him, breaking its leg. The ship sinks into the [[Mariana Trench]] drowning his family. Pi briefly sees what appears to be a survivor, but it turns out to be Richard Parker.\n\nAfter the storm, Pi awakens in the lifeboat with the zebra and is joined by a resourceful [[orangutan]]. A [[spotted hyena]] emerges from under a tarpaulin covering half of the lifeboat and snaps at Pi, forcing him to retreat to the end of the boat. The hyena kills the zebra and later the orangutan. Richard Parker emerges from under the tarpaulin, killing the hyena before retreating back to cover for several days.\n\nPi fashions a small tethered raft from flotation vests to which he retreats for safety from Richard Parker. Despite his moral code against killing, he begins fishing, enabling him to sustain the tiger as well. When the tiger jumps into the sea to hunt for fish and then comes threateningly towards Pi, Pi considers letting him drown, but ultimately helps him back into the boat. One night, a [[humpback whale]] comes too close to the boat, destroying the raft and its supplies. Pi trains Richard Parker to accept him in the boat, and realizes that caring for the tiger is also helping keep himself alive.\n\nWeeks later they encounter a floating island of interconnected trees. It is a lush jungle of edible plants, freshwater pools and a large population of [[meerkat]]s, enabling Pi and Richard Parker to eat and drink freely and regain strength. At night, the island transforms into a hostile environment. Richard Parker retreats to the lifeboat while Pi and the meerkats sleep in the trees; the water pools turn [[acid]]ic, digesting the fish in them. Pi deduces that the island is [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] after finding a human tooth embedded in a flower.\n\nPi and Richard Parker leave the island, eventually reaching the coast of [[Mexico]]. Pi is saddened that Richard Parker does not acknowledge him before disappearing into the jungle. He is rescued and brought to a hospital. [[Insurance agent]]s for the Japanese freighter company interview him, but do not believe his story and ask what really happened. He tells a different story, in which the animals are replaced by human survivors: his mother for the orangutan, an amiable sailor for the zebra, and the ship's brutish cook for the hyena. In this story, the cook kills the sailor and feeds on his flesh. He also kills Pi's mother after which Pi kills him with a knife and uses his remains as food and fish bait. The insurance agents are dissatisfied with this story, but they leave without questioning Pi further.\n\nThe writer recognizes the parallels between the two stories, noting that in the second version Pi is actually Richard Parker. Pi says that it does not matter which story is the truth because his family still died either way. He then asks which story the author prefers, and the author chooses the first, to which Pi replies, \"and so it goes with God\". After Pi leaves to greet a returning Anandi, now his wife, the writer glances at a copy of the official insurance report, reading aloud that Pi survived his great adventure \"in the company of an adult Bengal tiger.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Suraj Sharma]] as Piscine Molitor \"Pi\" Patel, age 16/17\n** [[Irrfan Khan]] as Pi, adult\n** Gautam Belur as Pi, age 5\n** [[Ayush Tandon]] as Pi, age 11/12\n* [[Rafe Spall]] as [[Yann Martel|The Writer]]\n* [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] as Gita Patel, Pi's mother\n* [[Adil Hussain]] as Santosh Patel, Pi's father\n* Ayan Khan as Ravi Patel, Pi's older brother, age 7\n** Mohamed Abbas Khaleeli as Ravi, age 13/14\n** Vibish Sivakumar as Ravi, age 18/19\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as the Cook\n* Wang Po-chieh as Sailor\n* [[Jag Huang]] as Sailor\n* [[Andrea Di Stefano]] as the Priest\n* [[Shravanthi Sainath]] as Anandi, age 16/17, Pi's girlfriend\n** [[Mythili Prakash]] as Anandi, adult, Pi's wife\n* Raj Patel as Pi's and Anandi's Son\n* Hadiqa Hamid as Pi's and Anandi's Pi's Daughter\n* Elie Alouf as Francis{{efn|Pi refers to Francis in the film as \"Mamaji\", a [[Hindi]] word for \"Maternal Uncle\"}}\n{{notelist}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{quote box|quote=I wanted to use water because the film is talking about faith, and it contains fish, life and every emotion for Pi.

The writer has been told that Pi's life story would be a good subject for a book. Pi tells the writer the following story about his life:\n\nPi's father names him Piscine Molitor Patel after [[Piscine Molitor|the swimming pool in France]]. In secondary school in [[Pondicherry]], he adopts the name \"[[Pi]]\" (the Greek letter, {{pi}}) to avoid the [[Homophone|sound-alike]] nickname \"Pissing Patel\". He is raised in a [[Hinduism|Hindu]] family, but at 12 years old, is introduced to [[Catholic Christianity|Christianity]] and then [[Islam]], and decides to follow all three religions as he \"just wants to love God\". His mother supports his desire to grow, but his rationalist father tries to secularize him. Pi's family owns a zoo, and Pi takes interest in the animals, especially a [[Bengal tiger]] named [[Life of Pi#Richard Parker|Richard Parker]]. After Pi gets dangerously close to Richard Parker, his father forces him to witness the tiger killing a goat.\n\nWhen Pi is 16, his father announces that they must move to Canada, where he intends to settle and sell the animals. The family books passage with the animals on a Japanese freighter. During a storm, the ship [[Shipwrecking|founders]] while Pi is on deck. He tries to find his family, but a crewman throws him into a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|lifeboat]]. A freed [[zebra]] jumps onto the boat with him, breaking its leg. The ship sinks into the [[Mariana Trench]] drowning his family. Pi briefly sees what appears to be a survivor, but it turns out to be Richard Parker.\n\nAfter the storm, Pi awakens in the lifeboat with the zebra and is joined by a resourceful [[orangutan]]. A [[spotted hyena]] emerges from under a tarpaulin covering half of the lifeboat and snaps at Pi, forcing him to retreat to the end of the boat. The hyena kills the zebra and later the orangutan. Richard Parker emerges from under the tarpaulin, killing the hyena before retreating back to cover for several days.\n\nPi fashions a small tethered raft from flotation vests to which he retreats for safety from Richard Parker. Despite his moral code against killing, he begins fishing, enabling him to sustain the tiger as well. When the tiger jumps into the sea to hunt for fish and then comes threateningly towards Pi, Pi considers letting him drown, but ultimately helps him back into the boat. One night, a [[humpback whale]] comes too close to the boat, destroying the raft and its supplies. Pi trains Richard Parker to accept him in the boat, and realizes that caring for the tiger is also helping keep himself alive.\n\nWeeks later they encounter a floating island of interconnected trees. It is a lush jungle of edible plants, freshwater pools and a large population of [[meerkat]]s, enabling Pi and Richard Parker to eat and drink freely and regain strength. At night, the island transforms into a hostile environment. Richard Parker retreats to the lifeboat while Pi and the meerkats sleep in the trees; the water pools turn [[acid]]ic, digesting the fish in them. Pi deduces that the island is [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] after finding a human tooth embedded in a flower.\n\nPi and Richard Parker leave the island, eventually reaching the coast of [[Mexico]]. Pi is saddened that Richard Parker does not acknowledge him before disappearing into the jungle. He is rescued and brought to a hospital. [[Insurance agent]]s for the Japanese freighter company interview him, but do not believe his story and ask what really happened. He tells a different story, in which the animals are replaced by human survivors: his mother for the orangutan, an amiable sailor for the zebra, and the ship's brutish cook for the hyena. In this story, the cook kills the sailor and feeds on his flesh. He also kills Pi's mother after which Pi kills him with a knife and uses his remains as food and fish bait. The insurance agents are dissatisfied with this story, but they leave without questioning Pi further.\n\nThe writer recognizes the parallels between the two stories, noting that in the second version Pi is actually Richard Parker. Pi says that it does not matter which story is the truth because his family still died either way. He then asks which story the author prefers, and the author chooses the first, to which Pi replies, \"and so it goes with God\". Glancing at a copy of the official insurance report, the writer reads aloud that Pi survived his great adventure \"in the company of an adult Bengal tiger.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Suraj Sharma]] as Piscine Molitor \"Pi\" Patel, age 16/17\n** [[Irrfan Khan]] as Pi, adult\n** Gautam Belur as Pi, age 5\n** [[Ayush Tandon]] as Pi, age 11/12\n* [[Rafe Spall]] as [[Yann Martel|The Writer]]\n* [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] as Gita Patel, Pi's mother\n* [[Adil Hussain]] as Santosh Patel, Pi's father\n* Ayan Khan as Ravi Patel, Pi's older brother, age 7\n** Mohamed Abbas Khaleeli as Ravi, age 13/14\n** Vibish Sivakumar as Ravi, age 18/19\n* [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]] as the Cook\n* Wang Po-chieh as Sailor\n* [[Jag Huang]] as Sailor\n* [[Shravanthi Sainath]] as Anandi, Pi's teenage girlfriend\n* [[Andrea Di Stefano]] as the Priest\n* Elie Alouf as Francis{{efn|Pi refers to Francis in the film as \"Mamaji\", a [[Hindi]] word for \"Maternal Uncle\"}}\n{{notelist}}\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\n{{quote box|quote=I wanted to use water because the film is talking about faith, and it contains fish, life and every emotion for Pi.

In the year 1939, there were two [[eclipse]]s of the [[moon]], falling on the third of May and the twenty-eighth of October. There were also two eclipses of the [[sun]], an annular eclipse on the nineteenth of April, the path of annular eclipse grazing the [[North Pole]] of the [[earth]], and a total eclipse on the twelfth of October, the total path crossing near the [[South Pole]]. The [[heliocentric]] [[longitudes]] of the [[planet]]s on the first of January at zero-hours [[Greenwich Mean Time|Greenwich time]] were as follows:<ref name=\"Westinghouse 1938, p. 10\" />\n{{clear}}\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-4}}\n: '''Planet'''\n* Mercury\n* Venus\n* Earth\n* Mars\n* Jupiter\n* Saturn\n* Uranus\n* Neptune\n* Pluto\n{{Col-2-of-4}}\n'''degrees'''\n: 175\n: 124\n: 99\n: 192\n: 339\n: 17\n: 46\n: 171\n: 120\n{{Col-3-of-4}}\n'''minutes'''\n: 55\n: 43\n: 40\n: 4\n: 12\n: 30\n: 23\n: 32\n: 17\n{{Col-4-of-4}}\n'''seconds'''\n: 42\n: 32\n: 29\n: 2\n: 22\n: 45\n: 31\n: 3\n: 0\n{{Col-end}}\n\nThe mean position of the [[North Star]] [[Polaris]] (Alpha Ursae Minoris) on the first of January was [[Right Ascension]], 1 hour, 41 minutes, 59 seconds; North Polar distance, 1 degree, 1 minute, and 33.8 seconds. [[Astronomers]] of the early twentieth century determined that such a combination of astronomical events is unlikely to recur for many thousands of years.

A secondary loop of wire, about {{convert|1|ft|m}} in diameter, will detect a \"distortion field\", thus indicating the exact location of the two metal alloy time capsules, assuming no other large metal objects are in the vicinity.<ref>Westinghouse (1938), pp. 39-41</ref>\n\nAt the close of the 1965 World's Fair, a seven-ton \"permanent sentinel\" granite monument, made by the [[Rock of Ages Corporation]], was installed.

We are crossing the seas by power and utilise power also in order to relieve humanity from all tiring muscular work. We have learned to fly and we are able to send messages and news without any difficulty over the entire world through electric waves. However, the production and distribution of commodities is entirely unorganised so that everybody must live in fear of being eliminated from the economic cycle, in this way suffering for the want of everything. Further more, people living in different countries kill each other at irregular time intervals, so that also for this reason any one who thinks about the future must live in fear and terror. This is due to the fact that the intelligence and character of the masses are incomparably lower than the intelligence and character of the few who produce some thing valuable for the community. I trust that posterity will read these statements with a feeling of proud and justified superiority.''<ref>Westinghouse (1938), p. 48</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Robert Andrews Millikan]]'s message,\n[[File:Robert A Millikan signature.jpg|left|thumb|100px]]\n<blockquote>\n''At this moment, August 22, 1938, the principles of representative ballot government, such as are represented by the governments of the Anglo-Saxon, French, and Scandinavian countries, are in deadly conflict with the principles of despotism, which up to two centuries ago had controlled the destiny of man throughout practically the whole of recorded history. If the rational, scientific, progressive principles win out in this struggle there is a possibility of a warless, golden age ahead for mankind. If the reactionary principles of despotism triumph now and in the future, the future history of mankind will repeat the sad story of war and oppression as in the past.''<ref name=west47>Westinghouse (1938), p. 47</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Thomas Mann]]'s message,\n[[File:Thomas Mann signature.jpg|left|thumb|100px]]\n<blockquote>\n''We know now that the idea of the future as a \"better world\" was a fallacy of the doctrine of progress. The hopes we center on you, citizens of the future, are in no way exaggerated. In broad outline, you will actually resemble us very much as we resemble those who lived a thousand, or five thousand, years ago. Among you too the spirit will fare badly. It should never fare too well on this earth, otherwise men would need it no longer. That optimistic conception of the future is a projection into time of an endeavor which does not belong to the temporal world, the endeavor on the part of man to approximate to his idea of himself, the humanization of man. What we, in this year of Our Lord 1938, understand by the term \"culture\" a notion held in small esteem today by certain nations of the western world is simply this endeavor. What we call the spirit is identical with it, too. Brothers of the future, united with us in the spirit and in this endeavor, we send our greetings.''<ref name=west47 />\n</blockquote>\n\n==Inscription on the time capsules==\nThe exterior of the 1938 time capsule is die-stamped with this message to anyone who might stumble upon it prior to the scheduled opening year of 6939.<ref>Westinghouse (1938), p. 9</ref>\n\n[[File:Westinghouse timecapsule replica4.jpg|thumb|center|800px]]<center><blockquote><small>TIME CAPSULE OF CUPALOY, DEPOSITED ON THE SITE OF THE NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR ON SEPTEMBER 23,1938,<br /> BY THE WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC & MANUFACTURING COMPANY.

More than 3000 copies of the book were distributed to museums, monasteries, and libraries worldwide.<ref>Westinghouse (1939), pp 11-13</ref> In order to avoid confusion about the 1965 time capsule, a supplement announcing Time Capsule II was sent to the original 3,000 depositories of the 1938 edition.<ref>{{cite web |title=Westinghouse Time Capsule 1964 |url=http://davidszondy.com/future/timecapsule/timecapsule1964.htm |website=davidszondy.com |accessdate=17 October 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040822235727/http://www.davidszondy.com/future/timecapsule/timecapsule1964.htm |archivedate=August 22, 2004}}</ref>\n\nIf present-day methods of determining time are lost, future generations will be able to calculate the age of the time capsules using astronomical data. In the year 1939, there were two [[eclipse]]s of the [[moon]], falling on the third of May and the twenty-eighth of October. There were also two eclipses of the [[sun]], an annular eclipse on the nineteenth of April, the path of annular eclipse grazing the [[North Pole]] of the [[earth]], and a total eclipse on the twelfth of October, the total path crossing near the [[South Pole]]. The [[heliocentric]] [[longitudes]] of the [[planet]]s on the first of January at zero-hours [[Greenwich Mean Time|Greenwich time]] were as follows:<ref name=\"Westinghouse 1938, p. 10\" />\n{{clear}}\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-1-of-4}}\n: '''Planet'''\n* Mercury\n* Venus\n* Earth\n* Mars\n* Jupiter\n* Saturn\n* Uranus\n* Neptune\n* Pluto\n{{Col-2-of-4}}\n'''degrees'''\n: 175\n: 124\n: 99\n: 192\n: 339\n: 17\n: 46\n: 171\n: 120\n{{Col-3-of-4}}\n'''minutes'''\n: 55\n: 43\n: 40\n: 4\n: 12\n: 30\n: 23\n: 32\n: 17\n{{Col-4-of-4}}\n'''seconds'''\n: 42\n: 32\n: 29\n: 2\n: 22\n: 45\n: 31\n: 3\n: 0\n{{Col-end}}\n\nThe mean position of the [[North Star]] [[Polaris]] (Alpha Ursae Minoris) on the first of January was [[Right Ascension]], 1 hour, 41 minutes, 59 seconds; North Polar distance, 1 degree, 1 minute, and 33.8 seconds. [[Astronomers]] of the early twentieth century determined that such a combination of astronomical events is unlikely to recur for many thousands of years. It is thought that this information will allow people of the future to determine the number of years that have elapsed since the capsule was buried by computing backward from their time.<ref name=\"Westinghouse 1938, p. 11\">Westinghouse (1938), p. 11</ref>\n\n==Location of the two time capsules==\n[[File:Time capsule internment plan.png|right|thumb|200px|1939 Westinghouse exhibit]]\n\nTime Capsule I was lowered at noon on September 23, 1938, the precise moment of the [[Autumnal Equinox]]. The latitude and longitude coordinates of its burying place, as determined by the [[U.S. National Geodetic Survey]], was recorded in the ''Book of Record'' as {{coord|40|44|34.09|N|73|50|43.84|W|region:US-NY_type:landmark}} within an {{convert|1|in|cm}}).<ref name=\"Westinghouse 1938, p. 11\"/> The time capsule will likely move vertically or horizontally for geological reasons,<ref name=\"Westinghouse 1938, p. 11\"/> so an alternate [[electromagnetic field]] method was provided. This method involves constructing a loop of wire {{convert|10|ft|m}} in diameter and putting an [[alternating current]] (between 1,000 and 5,000 [[hertz]]) through it with a power of at least 200 [[watt]]s. A secondary loop of wire, about {{convert|1|ft|m}} in diameter, will detect a \"distortion field\", thus indicating the exact location of the two metal alloy time capsules, assuming no other large metal objects are in the vicinity.<ref>Westinghouse (1938), pp. 39-41</ref>\n\nAt the close of the 1965 World's Fair, a seven-ton \"permanent sentinel\" granite monument, made by the [[Rock of Ages Corporation]], was installed. The {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} shaft was filled using pitch, concrete and earth, and the monument placed to mark the position where the two time capsules are buried.<ref name=\"Press Release October 16, 1965\"/><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/specials/magazine3/brochure.html#Permanent%20Sentinel Permanent Sentinel].

We are crossing the seas by power and utilise power also in order to relieve humanity from all tiring muscular work. We have learned to fly and we are able to send messages and news without any difficulty over the entire world through electric waves. However, the production and distribution of commodities is entirely unorganised so that everybody must live in fear of being eliminated from the economic cycle, in this way suffering for the want of everything. Further more, people living in different countries kill each other at irregular time intervals, so that also for this reason any one who thinks about the future must live in fear and terror. This is due to the fact that the intelligence and character of the masses are incomparably lower than the intelligence and character of the few who produce some thing valuable for the community. I trust that posterity will read these statements with a feeling of proud and justified superiority.''<ref>Westinghouse (1938), p. 48</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Robert Andrews Millikan]]'s message,\n[[File:Robert A Millikan signature.jpg|left|thumb|100px]]\n<blockquote>\n''At this moment, August 22, 1938, the principles of representative ballot government, such as are represented by the governments of the Anglo-Saxon, French, and Scandinavian countries, are in deadly conflict with the principles of despotism, which up to two centuries ago had controlled the destiny of man throughout practically the whole of recorded history. If the rational, scientific, progressive principles win out in this struggle there is a possibility of a warless, golden age ahead for mankind. If the reactionary principles of despotism triumph now and in the future, the future history of mankind will repeat the sad story of war and oppression as in the past.''<ref name=west47>Westinghouse (1938), p. 47</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Thomas Mann]]'s message,\n[[File:Thomas Mann signature.jpg|left|thumb|100px]]\n<blockquote>\n''We know now that the idea of the future as a \"better world\" was a fallacy of the doctrine of progress. The hopes we center on you, citizens of the future, are in no way exaggerated. In broad outline, you will actually resemble us very much as we resemble those who lived a thousand, or five thousand, years ago. Among you too the spirit will fare badly. It should never fare too well on this earth, otherwise men would need it no longer. That optimistic conception of the future is a projection into time of an endeavor which does not belong to the temporal world, the endeavor on the part of man to approximate to his idea of himself, the humanization of man. What we, in this year of Our Lord 1938, understand by the term \"culture\" a notion held in small esteem today by certain nations of the western world is simply this endeavor. What we call the spirit is identical with it, too. Brothers of the future, united with us in the spirit and in this endeavor, we send our greetings.''<ref name=west47 />\n</blockquote>\n\n==Inscription on the time capsules==\nThe exterior of the 1938 time capsule is die-stamped with this message to anyone who might stumble upon it prior to the scheduled opening year of 6939.<ref>Westinghouse (1938), p. 9</ref>\n\n[[File:Westinghouse timecapsule replica4.jpg|thumb|center|800px]]<center><blockquote><small>TIME CAPSULE OF CUPALOY, DEPOSITED ON THE SITE OF THE NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR ON SEPTEMBER 23,1938,<br /> BY THE WESTINGHOUSE ELECTRIC & MANUFACTURING COMPANY.
