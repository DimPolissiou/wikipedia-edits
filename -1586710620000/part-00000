It was also briefly marketed as a [[Holden]]. For most of its recent history, the Suburban has been a [[station wagon]]-bodied version of the [[List of Chevrolet pickup trucks|Chevrolet pickup truck]], including the [[Chevrolet C/K]] and [[Chevrolet Silverado|Silverado]] series of truck-based vehicles. [[Cadillac]] offers a version called the [[Cadillac Escalade ESV|Escalade ESV]].\n\nThe Suburban is sold in the United States, Canada, Central America, Chile, Bolivia, Mexico, Peru, Myanmar, Laos, Angola, the Philippines, and the Middle East (except Israel) while the Yukon XL is sold only in North America (exclusive to United States and Canada; Mexico to start in 2020) and the Middle East territories (except Israel).\n\nA 2018 iSeeCars.com study identified the Chevrolet Suburban as the car that is driven the most each year.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blackley |first1=Julie |title=The Cars People Drive the Most |url=https://www.iseecars.com/most-driven-cars-study |website=iSeeCars.com}}</ref> A 2019 [[iSeeCars.com]] study named the Chevrolet Suburban the second-ranked longest-lasting vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.iseecars.com/longest-lasting-cars-2019-study/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524042759/https://www.iseecars.com/longest-lasting-cars-2019-study |archive-date=May 24, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2019, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce unveiled a [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] star for the Suburban, noting that the Suburban had been in \"1,750 films and TV shows since 1952.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eisenstein |first1=Paul A. |title=The latest celeb to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is... the Chevy Suburban |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/latest-celeb-get-star-hollywood-walk-fame-chevy-suburban-n1097101 |accessdate=29 January 2020 |agency=NBC News |date=7 December 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30152850/chevy-suburban-walk-of-fame/</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSeveral automotive companies in the United States used the \"Suburban\" designation to indicate a windowed, station wagon type body on a commercial frame including [[DeSoto Suburban|DeSoto]], [[Dodge]], [[Plymouth Suburban|Plymouth]], [[Studebaker]], [[Nash Motors|Nash]], [[Chevrolet]], and [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]. The (Westchester) Suburban name was, in fact, a trademark of U.S. Body and Forging Co. of [[Tell City, Indiana]], which built wooden station wagon bodies for all of these automobile and light truck chassis and more.\n\nChevrolet began production of its all-steel \"carryall-suburban\" in 1934.<ref name=myautoworld/> [[GMC Truck|GMC]] brought out its version in 1937. These vehicles were also known as the \"Suburban Carryall\" until GM shortened the name to simply \"Suburban\". GMC's equivalent to the Chevrolet model was originally named \"Suburban\" as well, until being rebranded as \"Yukon XL\" for the 2000 model year.\n\nWith the end of production of the [[Dodge Town Wagon]] in 1966 and the [[Plymouth Fury Suburban]] station wagon in 1978, only [[General Motors]] continued to manufacture a vehicle branded as a \"Suburban\", and GM was awarded an exclusive trademark on the name in 1988. The Chevrolet Suburban is one of the largest SUVs on the market today. It has outlasted competitive vehicles such as the [[Travelall|International Harvester Travelall]], [[Jeep Wagoneer]], and the [[Ford Excursion]]. The latest competitor is the extended [[Ford Expedition|Ford Expedition EL]], which replaced the Excursion.\n\nThe Suburban of today is a full-size SUV (upgraded to extended length from 1967 onward to make room for the then-new K5 Blazer that debuted in 1969) with three rows of seating, a full [[pickup truck]] frame, and [[V8 engine]]. It is one of the few [[station wagon]]s available with all bench rows. The Suburban is the same height and width as the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]], although the Suburban is {{convert|20|in|mm}} longer. The extra length provides a full-sized cargo area behind the 9 passenger seating area. From 1973 to 2013 it had been available in half-ton and 3/4-ton versions, the latter discontinued after the 2013 model year, but was revived in 2015 as a fleet-exclusive vehicle for the 2016 model year.\n[[File:TPS MU.jpg|thumb|A ninth-generation suburban is used for a police truck in [[Toronto]]]]\nIn recent years, the Suburban has been used as a [[police truck]], [[fire chief's vehicle]], or [[Emergency Medical Services|EMS]] [[vehicle]]. Suburbans are also used as [[limousines]]. Gothic black Suburban vehicles are commonly used by federal intelligence services, such as [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] for example.

It was based on the contemporary Brazilian Chevrolet '''C-14'''. Like the C-14, the C-1416/Veraneio used the instrument cluster from the US C/K series although the exterior sheet metal layout is exclusive to Brazil. It was initially powered with a Chevrolet 4.2 L inline six based on the pre-1962 \"Stovebolt\" engines. Later it used the 250-cid 4.1 L engine from Chevrolet's Brazilian mid-size sedan \u2013 the [[Chevrolet Opala|Opala]]. The original version of the Veraneio was kept in production, with another grille and interior, until 1988 (model year 1989), but it was eventually replaced with an updated version based on the '''[[Chevrolet D-20|S\u00e9rie 20]]''' family.<ref name=\"Veraneio\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lexicarbrasil.com.br/chevrolet/#attachment_2949 |title=Chevrolet |access-date=February 20, 2015 |publisher=Lexicar Brazil |language=Portuguese }}</ref> The second generation of Veraneio was produced from 1989 to 1995.\n\nIn 1997 GM introduced in Brazil the North American pickups for the local market, replacing the \"C Series\". The Brazilian version of the Suburban was also converted to the current generation at the time and lasted until 2001, was called the Grand Blazer, a successor to the Veraneio. The 4.1 L inline six engine with {{convert|138|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was offered on both models with option for a MWM 4.2 L turbodiesel unit with {{convert|168|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 2015, ''[[Autoweek]]'' ranked the Veraneio fourth among the Chevrolet station wagons that America never got. It also cited the vehicle's design as \"baroque\" and summed it up as \"It's a 1960s Brazilian crossover.\" Autoweek notes that The Veraneio can be imported to the United States, depending on the condition of the vehicle.<ref>[http://autoweek.com/article/classic-cars/7-chevrolet-station-wagons-america-never-got \"7 Chevrolet station wagons America never got\"] from ''Autoweek'' (September 15, 2015)</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Seventh generation (1973\u20131991) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = 1973\u20131991\n| image = GMC Suburban -- 12-14-2011.jpg\n| aka = GMC Suburban<br />Chevrolet Veraneio (Brazilian version)\n| model_years = 1973\u20131991 (1989\u20131996 in [[Brazil]])\n| platform = [[Chevrolet C/K|C/K series]]\n| body_style = 4-door SUV <br /> 2-door SWB SUV (Brazil) <br /> 4-door Pickup Truck (Brazil)\n| layout = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]],<br />[[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| engine = '''Diesel:'''<br />4.0 L (245&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) I4 Maxion S4/S4T (Brazil)<br />5.7 L (350&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) [[Oldsmobile Diesel engine#LF9|LF9]] V8 (1978\u201381)<br />6.2 L (379&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2L|Detroit Diesel]] V8 (1982\u201391)<br />'''Gasoline:'''<br />4.1 L (250&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) I6<br />5.0 L (305&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) V8 (1976\u201388)<br />5.0 L (307&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) V8 (1973)<br />5.7 L (350&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) V8<br />6.6 L (400 cu in) V8 (1976\u201380)<br />7.4 L (454&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) V8\n| transmission = '''Manual:'''<br />3-Speed<br />4-Speed<br />'''Automatic:'''<br />3-Speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|THM-350]]<br />3-Speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|THM-400]]<br />4-Speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#700R4 / 4L60 / 4L60E / 4L65E|700R4]] (1981\u201391)<br />4-Speed [[GM 4L80-E transmission|4L80-E]] (1991)\n| length = {{convert|219.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|79.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = R10: {{convert|72.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />V10: {{convert|73.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />R20: {{convert|74.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />V20: {{convert|76.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|129.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| curb weight = {{convert|5837|lb|abbr=on}}\n| related = [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevrolet K-Blazer/GMC K-Jimmy]]<br />[[Chevrolet C/K|Chevrolet/GMC C/K]]\n| assembly = [[Flint, Michigan]]<br />[[Janesville, Wisconsin]]<br />[[S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul]], Brazil\n}}\n\nWith the [[Chevrolet C/K#Third generation 1973\u20131987|third generation Rounded-Line C/R & K/V]] models, the Suburban became a four-door vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1973_Trucks_and_Vans/1973%20Chevrolet%20Suburban/1973%20Chevy%20Suburban-03.html |title=1973 Trucks and_Vans album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}</ref> The Rounded-Line 1970s body style remained largely unchanged for 19 model years \u2013 making this series the longest Suburban generation in production. 2WD (C/R) and 4WD models (K/V) were both available in 1/2 and 3/4 ton (\"10\" and \"20\") chassis.\n\nSuburbans for model year 1973<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1973_Trucks_and_Vans/1973%20Chevrolet%20Suburban%20Limo/1973%20Chevy%20Suburban%20Limo-01.html |title=1973 Trucks and Vans album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}</ref> now had two doors on each side (the previous generation had just one door on the driver's side), front-and-rear [[air conditioning]], a baggage rack, a heater under the third seat and step-plates for easier access.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1973_Trucks_and_Vans/1973%20Chevrolet%20Suburban%20Limo/1973%20Chevy%20Suburban%20Limo-04.html |title=1973 Trucks and Vans album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}</ref> A new [[Locking differential#Automatic lockers|''Eaton Automatic Differential Lock'']] was introduced as an option extra for the rear [[Differential (mechanics)|differential]].\n\nFor the 1973 model year the base engine was the 250 CID inline six (100 net HP), with a 307 or 350-cubic-inch small block V8 (115 or 155 net), or the new-for-1973 454 CID big block V8 (240 net HP) optional.

Also for 1989, the grille was redesigned to accommodate a quad side-by-side headlight setup and larger marker lights/turn signals than the previous dual filament single headlight setup, which was styled concurrently with the GMT400 light duty trucks. Economy models (usually for fleet usage) were available with only two headlights (again, based on the base model C/K series).\n\n[[General Motors|GM]] temporarily changed the usual \"[[Chevrolet C/K|C/K]]\" designation to \"R\" and \"V\" for the 1987 through 1991 model years.

The exterior features a more [[aerodynamic]] shape, made partly by a steeply raked windshield angle. The new design is more aerodynamic.\n\nThe interior has a redesigned dashboard and improved seats. It still retains its 9-passenger seating availability, which is available on LS and SLE models only. LT2, and LT3 models have leather seating and available 6-, 7-, and 8-passenger seating. A Z71 package was available on LT2 and LT3 models which includes two-tone leather seats.

This now includes inlaid doors that tuck into the door sills, instead of over them, improving aerodynamics, fuel economy, and lessens interior noise. The hoods and liftgate panels are made of aluminum in an effort to reduce vehicle weight, and the wiper blades that were located on the liftgate door were moved to the rear spoiler located on the top of the rear liftgate window. Also noticeable is the SUV's length, which expands from {{convert|222.4|to|224.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (the Yukon XL's length is shorter at {{convert|224.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}) and its width from {{convert|79.1|to|80.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, while the height decreases from {{convert|76.8|to|74.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, thus allowing the vehicle to become slightly leaner, a little bit wider, more streamlined, and roomier.\n\nA more-efficient, direct-injected EcoTec3 V8 powertrain (5.3 for the Suburban, 6.2 for Yukon XL/Yukon Denali XL) coupled with improved aerodynamics, helped the SUVs offer greater estimated highway fuel economy and improving its fuel economy estimates to 16MPG (City)/23MPG (Highway)/18 (Combined) for 2WD, and 15MPG (City)/22MPG (Highway)/18 (Combined) for 4WD.<ref>[https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2015_Chevrolet_Suburban.shtml 2015 Chevrolet Suburban] from http://www.fueleconomy.gov</ref> The increased fuel economy also vaulted the Suburban/Yukon XL into the top spot among large SUVs with the most efficient fuel economy rating numbers for this segment.<ref>[http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/1402-2015-chevrolet-suburban-tahoe-gmc-yukon-epa-rated/ \"2015 Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon EPA Rated\"] from ''Automobile Magazine'' (February 24, 2014)</ref> However, when ''Motor Trend'' (which placed the 2015 Suburban on the front cover of its June 2014 issue) did a road test review on the SUVs, it estimated the 4WD MPG on the Suburban LTZ to be slightly better at around 15.2 City and 22.3 Highway, while the 4WD Yukon Denali XL, whose fuel economy (MPG) is rated at 14 City/20 Highway, was estimated lower at 12.4 City and 19.2 Highway.<ref>[http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/suvs/1404_2015_chevrolet_suburban_gmc_yukon_xl_first_test/ \"First Test: 2015 Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon Denali XL\"] from ''[[Motor Trend]]'' (April 3, 2014)</ref>\n\nLike the 2007\u201314 version, both the Suburban and Yukon XL do not share a single piece of sheetmetal or lighting element with the brands' full-size pick-up trucks (GMC Sierra and Chevy Silverado), and the front grilles of both vehicles are slightly altered to give it their own identity. The front headlights features projector-beam headlamps that flanks the Chevrolet-signature dual-port grille \u2013 chrome on all models, sweeping into the front fenders, while Tahoe and Suburban LTZ and Yukon and Yukon XL Denali trims feature projector beam high-intensity discharge headlamps and light-emitting diode daytime running lamps. The Yukon and Yukon XL also feature projector-beam halogen headlamps on all SLE and SLT trims. The improved safety features included a 360-degree radar detection for crash avoidance and occupant protection and a high-tech anti-theft system that now includes vertical and interior sensors, in-glass and window breaking, a triggering alarm and a shutdown device that prevents the vehicle from moving. The latter is expected to address the issues regarding the constant thefts of the vehicles, especially with the previous generation's removable seats and items left in the cargo space, which has become a target for carjackers who see the third row seats as valuable on the black market.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2013/12/24/chevy-tahoe-suburban-gmc-yukon-theft-tech/ \"GM looks to combat high theft rates on SUVs with added tech\"] from Autoblog (December 24, 2013)</ref> According to General Motors' head of Global Vehicle Security Bill Biondo, \"We have engineered a layered approach to vehicle security,\" adding that \"With new standard features and the available theft protection package, we are making the vehicles less attractive target to thieves and more secure for our customers.\"<ref>[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2013/12/a-look-at-the-multitude-of-anti-theft-feature-for-the-2015-tahoe-and-suburban-video/ \"A Look At The Multitude Of Anti-Theft Features For The 2015 Tahoe And Suburban: Video\"] from GM Authority (December 20, 2013)</ref>\n\nAlso new are the addition of fold-flat second and third-row seats (replacing the aforementioned removable third seats), which is now a standard feature but can be equipped with an optional power-folding feature for the upgraded trims, and an additional two inches of leg room for second-row passengers.

[[Cadillac]] offers a version called the [[Cadillac Escalade ESV|Escalade ESV]].\n\nThe Suburban is sold in the United States, Canada, Central America, Chile, Bolivia, Mexico, Peru, Myanmar, Laos, Angola, the Philippines, and the Middle East (except Israel) while the Yukon XL is sold only in North America (exclusive to United States and Canada; Mexico to start in 2020) and the Middle East territories (except Israel).\n\nA 2018 iSeeCars.com study identified the Chevrolet Suburban as the car that is driven the most each year.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blackley |first1=Julie |title=The Cars People Drive the Most |url=https://www.iseecars.com/most-driven-cars-study |website=iSeeCars.com}}</ref> A 2019 [[iSeeCars.com]] study named the Chevrolet Suburban the second-ranked longest-lasting vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.iseecars.com/longest-lasting-cars-2019-study/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=March 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190524042759/https://www.iseecars.com/longest-lasting-cars-2019-study |archive-date=May 24, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn December 2019, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce unveiled a [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] star for the Suburban, noting that the Suburban had been in \"1,750 films and TV shows since 1952.\"<ref>{{cite news |last1=Eisenstein |first1=Paul A. |title=The latest celeb to get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame is... the Chevy Suburban |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/latest-celeb-get-star-hollywood-walk-fame-chevy-suburban-n1097101 |accessdate=29 January 2020 |agency=NBC News |date=7 December 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a30152850/chevy-suburban-walk-of-fame/</ref>\n\n== History ==\nSeveral automotive companies in the United States used the \"Suburban\" designation to indicate a windowed, station wagon type body on a commercial frame including [[DeSoto Suburban|DeSoto]], [[Dodge]], [[Plymouth Suburban|Plymouth]], [[Studebaker]], [[Nash Motors|Nash]], [[Chevrolet]], and [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]. The (Westchester) Suburban name was, in fact, a trademark of U.S. Body and Forging Co. of [[Tell City, Indiana]], which built wooden station wagon bodies for all of these automobile and light truck chassis and more.\n\nChevrolet began production of its all-steel \"carryall-suburban\" in 1934.<ref name=myautoworld/> [[GMC Truck|GMC]] brought out its version in 1937. These vehicles were also known as the \"Suburban Carryall\" until GM shortened the name to simply \"Suburban\". GMC's equivalent to the Chevrolet model was originally named \"Suburban\" as well, until being rebranded as \"Yukon XL\" for the 2000 model year.\n\nWith the end of production of the [[Dodge Town Wagon]] in 1966 and the [[Plymouth Fury Suburban]] station wagon in 1978, only [[General Motors]] continued to manufacture a vehicle branded as a \"Suburban\", and GM was awarded an exclusive trademark on the name in 1988. The Chevrolet Suburban is one of the largest SUVs on the market today. It has outlasted competitive vehicles such as the [[Travelall|International Harvester Travelall]], [[Jeep Wagoneer]], and the [[Ford Excursion]]. The latest competitor is the extended [[Ford Expedition|Ford Expedition EL]], which replaced the Excursion.\n\nThe Suburban of today is a full-size SUV (upgraded to extended length from 1967 onward to make room for the then-new K5 Blazer that debuted in 1969) with three rows of seating, a full [[pickup truck]] frame, and [[V8 engine]]. It is one of the few [[station wagon]]s available with all bench rows. The Suburban is the same height and width as the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]], although the Suburban is {{convert|20|in|mm}} longer. The extra length provides a full-sized cargo area behind the 9 passenger seating area. From 1973 to 2013 it had been available in half-ton and 3/4-ton versions, the latter discontinued after the 2013 model year, but was revived in 2015 as a fleet-exclusive vehicle for the 2016 model year.\n[[File:TPS MU.jpg|thumb|A ninth-generation suburban is used for a police truck in [[Toronto]]]]\nIn recent years, the Suburban has been used as a [[police truck]], [[fire chief's vehicle]], or [[Emergency Medical Services|EMS]] [[vehicle]]. Suburbans are also used as [[limousines]]. Gothic black Suburban vehicles are commonly used by federal intelligence services, such as [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] for example. Secret Service operates fully armored versions of the Suburban for the [[President of the United States]] when he attends less formal engagements.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vehicles used by Secret Service|url=http://www.policecarwebsite.net/fc/fedcars/ss3.html|publisher=Government Police Cars Web Site}}</ref> The Suburban (as well as the Tahoe and GMC variants) is very popular with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] as a service vehicle.\n\nIn the late 1990s, GM also introduced a [[Right hand drive|RHD]] version of the Suburban, badged as a [[Holden]], for the Australian market.

It was based on the contemporary Brazilian Chevrolet '''C-14'''. Like the C-14, the C-1416/Veraneio used the instrument cluster from the US C/K series although the exterior sheet metal layout is exclusive to Brazil. It was initially powered with a Chevrolet 4.2 L inline six based on the pre-1962 \"Stovebolt\" engines. Later it used the 250-cid 4.1 L engine from Chevrolet's Brazilian mid-size sedan \u2013 the [[Chevrolet Opala|Opala]]. The original version of the Veraneio was kept in production, with another grille and interior, until 1988 (model year 1989), but it was eventually replaced with an updated version based on the '''[[Chevrolet D-20|S\u00e9rie 20]]''' family.<ref name=\"Veraneio\">{{cite web |url=http://www.lexicarbrasil.com.br/chevrolet/#attachment_2949 |title=Chevrolet |access-date=February 20, 2015 |publisher=Lexicar Brazil |language=Portuguese }}</ref> The second generation of Veraneio was produced from 1989 to 1995.\n\nIn 1997 GM introduced in Brazil the North American pickups for the local market, replacing the \"C Series\". The Brazilian version of the Suburban was also converted to the current generation at the time and lasted until 2001, was called the Grand Blazer, a successor to the Veraneio. The 4.1 L inline six engine with {{convert|138|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} was offered on both models with option for a MWM 4.2 L turbodiesel unit with {{convert|168|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 2015, ''[[Autoweek]]'' ranked the Veraneio fourth among the Chevrolet station wagons that America never got. It also cited the vehicle's design as \"baroque\" and summed it up as \"It's a 1960s Brazilian crossover.\" Autoweek notes that The Veraneio can be imported to the United States, depending on the condition of the vehicle.<ref>[http://autoweek.com/article/classic-cars/7-chevrolet-station-wagons-america-never-got \"7 Chevrolet station wagons America never got\"] from ''Autoweek'' (September 15, 2015)</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Seventh generation (1973\u20131991) ==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = 1973\u20131991\n| image = GMC Suburban -- 12-14-2011.jpg\n| aka = GMC Suburban<br />Chevrolet Veraneio (Brazilian version)\n| model_years = 1973\u20131991 (1989\u20131996 in [[Brazil]])\n| platform = [[Chevrolet C/K|C/K series]]\n| body_style = 4-door SUV <br /> 2-door SWB SUV (Brazil) <br /> 4-door Pickup Truck (Brazil)\n| layout = [[Front-engine design|Front engine]],<br />[[rear-wheel drive]] / [[four-wheel drive]]\n| engine = '''Diesel:'''<br />4.0 L (245&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) I4 Maxion S4/S4T (Brazil)<br />5.7 L (350&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) [[Oldsmobile Diesel engine#LF9|LF9]] V8 (1978\u201381)<br />6.2 L (379&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) [[Detroit Diesel V8 engine#6.2L|Detroit Diesel]] V8 (1982\u201391)<br />'''Gasoline:'''<br />4.1 L (250&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) I6<br />5.0 L (305&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) V8 (1976\u201388)<br />5.0 L (307&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) V8 (1973)<br />5.7 L (350&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) V8<br />6.6 L (400 cu in) V8 (1976\u201380)<br />7.4 L (454&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in) V8\n| transmission = '''Manual:'''<br />3-Speed<br />4-Speed<br />'''Automatic:'''<br />3-Speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM350|THM-350]]<br />3-Speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#Super Turbine 400 / THM400 / 3L80 / 3L80HD|THM-400]]<br />4-Speed [[Turbo-Hydramatic#700R4 / 4L60 / 4L60E / 4L65E|700R4]] (1981\u201391)<br />4-Speed [[GM 4L80-E transmission|4L80-E]] (1991)\n| length = {{convert|219.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|79.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| height = R10: {{convert|72.0|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />V10: {{convert|73.8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />R20: {{convert|74.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />V20: {{convert|76.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|129.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n| curb weight = {{convert|5837|lb|abbr=on}}\n| related = [[Chevrolet K5 Blazer|Chevrolet K-Blazer/GMC K-Jimmy]]<br />[[Chevrolet C/K|Chevrolet/GMC C/K]]\n| assembly = [[Flint, Michigan]]<br />[[Janesville, Wisconsin]]<br />[[S\u00e3o Caetano do Sul]], Brazil\n}}\n\nWith the [[Chevrolet C/K#Third generation 1973\u20131987|third generation Rounded-Line C/R & K/V]] models, the Suburban became a four-door vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1973_Trucks_and_Vans/1973%20Chevrolet%20Suburban/1973%20Chevy%20Suburban-03.html |title=1973 Trucks and_Vans album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}</ref> The Rounded-Line 1970s body style remained largely unchanged for 19 model years \u2013 making this series the longest Suburban generation in production. 2WD (C/R) and 4WD models (K/V) were both available in 1/2 and 3/4 ton (\"10\" and \"20\") chassis.\n\nSuburbans for model year 1973<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1973_Trucks_and_Vans/1973%20Chevrolet%20Suburban%20Limo/1973%20Chevy%20Suburban%20Limo-01.html |title=1973 Trucks and Vans album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}</ref> now had two doors on each side (the previous generation had just one door on the driver's side), front-and-rear [[air conditioning]], a baggage rack, a heater under the third seat and step-plates for easier access.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldcarbrochures.com/static/NA/GM%20Trucks%20and%20Vans/1973_Trucks_and_Vans/1973%20Chevrolet%20Suburban%20Limo/1973%20Chevy%20Suburban%20Limo-04.html |title=1973 Trucks and Vans album |publisher=Oldcarbrochures.com |accessdate=January 16, 2012}}</ref> A new [[Locking differential#Automatic lockers|''Eaton Automatic Differential Lock'']] was introduced as an option extra for the rear [[Differential (mechanics)|differential]].\n\nFor the 1973 model year the base engine was the 250 CID inline six (100 net HP), with a 307 or 350-cubic-inch small block V8 (115 or 155 net), or the new-for-1973 454 CID big block V8 (240 net HP) optional.

Also for 1989, the grille was redesigned to accommodate a quad side-by-side headlight setup and larger marker lights/turn signals than the previous dual filament single headlight setup, which was styled concurrently with the GMT400 light duty trucks. Economy models (usually for fleet usage) were available with only two headlights (again, based on the base model C/K series).\n\n[[General Motors|GM]] temporarily changed the usual \"[[Chevrolet C/K|C/K]]\" designation to \"R\" and \"V\" for the 1987 through 1991 model years.

The exterior features a more [[aerodynamic]] shape, made partly by a steeply raked windshield angle. The new design is more aerodynamic.\n\nThe interior has a redesigned dashboard and improved seats. It still retains its 9-passenger seating availability, which is available on LS and SLE models only. LT2, and LT3 models have leather seating and available 6-, 7-, and 8-passenger seating. A Z71 package was available on LT2 and LT3 models which includes two-tone leather seats.

This now includes inlaid doors that tuck into the door sills, instead of over them, improving aerodynamics, fuel economy, and lessens interior noise. The hoods and liftgate panels are made of aluminum in an effort to reduce vehicle weight, and the wiper blades that were located on the liftgate door were moved to the rear spoiler located on the top of the rear liftgate window. Also noticeable is the SUV's length, which expands from {{convert|222.4|to|224.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} (the Yukon XL's length is shorter at {{convert|224.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}) and its width from {{convert|79.1|to|80.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, while the height decreases from {{convert|76.8|to|74.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}, thus allowing the vehicle to become slightly leaner, a little bit wider, more streamlined, and roomier.\n\nA more-efficient, direct-injected EcoTec3 V8 powertrain (5.3 for the Suburban, 6.2 for Yukon XL/Yukon Denali XL) coupled with improved aerodynamics, helped the SUVs offer greater estimated highway fuel economy and improving its fuel economy estimates to 16MPG (City)/23MPG (Highway)/18 (Combined) for 2WD, and 15MPG (City)/22MPG (Highway)/18 (Combined) for 4WD.<ref>[https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/bymodel/2015_Chevrolet_Suburban.shtml 2015 Chevrolet Suburban] from http://www.fueleconomy.gov</ref> The increased fuel economy also vaulted the Suburban/Yukon XL into the top spot among large SUVs with the most efficient fuel economy rating numbers for this segment.<ref>[http://www.automobilemag.com/features/news/1402-2015-chevrolet-suburban-tahoe-gmc-yukon-epa-rated/ \"2015 Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon EPA Rated\"] from ''Automobile Magazine'' (February 24, 2014)</ref> However, when ''Motor Trend'' (which placed the 2015 Suburban on the front cover of its June 2014 issue) did a road test review on the SUVs, it estimated the 4WD MPG on the Suburban LTZ to be slightly better at around 15.2 City and 22.3 Highway, while the 4WD Yukon Denali XL, whose fuel economy (MPG) is rated at 14 City/20 Highway, was estimated lower at 12.4 City and 19.2 Highway.<ref>[http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/suvs/1404_2015_chevrolet_suburban_gmc_yukon_xl_first_test/ \"First Test: 2015 Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon Denali XL\"] from ''[[Motor Trend]]'' (April 3, 2014)</ref>\n\nLike the 2007\u201314 version, both the Suburban and Yukon XL do not share a single piece of sheetmetal or lighting element with the brands' full-size pick-up trucks (GMC Sierra and Chevy Silverado), and the front grilles of both vehicles are slightly altered to give it their own identity. The front headlights features projector-beam headlamps that flanks the Chevrolet-signature dual-port grille \u2013 chrome on all models, sweeping into the front fenders, while Tahoe and Suburban LTZ and Yukon and Yukon XL Denali trims feature projector beam high-intensity discharge headlamps and light-emitting diode daytime running lamps. The Yukon and Yukon XL also feature projector-beam halogen headlamps on all SLE and SLT trims. The improved safety features included a 360-degree radar detection for crash avoidance and occupant protection and a high-tech anti-theft system that now includes vertical and interior sensors, in-glass and window breaking, a triggering alarm and a shutdown device that prevents the vehicle from moving. The latter is expected to address the issues regarding the constant thefts of the vehicles, especially with the previous generation's removable seats and items left in the cargo space, which has become a target for carjackers who see the third row seats as valuable on the black market.<ref>[http://www.autoblog.com/2013/12/24/chevy-tahoe-suburban-gmc-yukon-theft-tech/ \"GM looks to combat high theft rates on SUVs with added tech\"] from Autoblog (December 24, 2013)</ref> According to General Motors' head of Global Vehicle Security Bill Biondo, \"We have engineered a layered approach to vehicle security,\" adding that \"With new standard features and the available theft protection package, we are making the vehicles less attractive target to thieves and more secure for our customers.\"<ref>[http://gmauthority.com/blog/2013/12/a-look-at-the-multitude-of-anti-theft-feature-for-the-2015-tahoe-and-suburban-video/ \"A Look At The Multitude Of Anti-Theft Features For The 2015 Tahoe And Suburban: Video\"] from GM Authority (December 20, 2013)</ref>\n\nAlso new are the addition of fold-flat second and third-row seats (replacing the aforementioned removable third seats), which is now a standard feature but can be equipped with an optional power-folding feature for the upgraded trims, and an additional two inches of leg room for second-row passengers.

It was founded in 1908 and plays its home matches at [[Clarence Park (St Albans)|Clarence Park]], about 800 yards from the city centre.\n\nThe club currently competes in the [[National League South]] (previously known as the [[Conference South]]), the sixth tier of English football. It competed in the [[Conference Premier]] (now the [[National League (division)|National League]]) during the 2006\u201307 season, but was relegated back to the Conference South after one season and subsequently suffered a further relegation in 2010\u201311, before returning to the sixth tier in 2013\u201314 after beating [[Chesham United FC]] 3\u20131 in the play-off final.\n\nCity's most famous match was arguably on 22 November 1922 in a fourth round qualifying [[FA Cup]] match. Having been held by [[Dulwich Hamlet]] to a 1\u20131 draw at Clarence Park on 18 November, the replay drew a gate of 4,060. City's [[New Zealand]]-born goalkeeper W. Tennant did not appear, his place taken by Alf Fearn who was usually a half-back with the reserves. Dulwich put eight goals past him, the winning goal coming in near darkness at the end of [[extra time]]. What put the game in the record books was that City scored seven times, with all seven goals being scored by [[Wilfred Minter]]. His feat remains the highest tally by a player on the losing side of an FA Cup tie.\n\n==History==\n{{recentism|date=February 2012}}\n\n=== Early history ===\nFormed in April 1908, St Albans City FC became members both the [[Spartan League]] Eastern Division and the [[Hertfordshire Senior County League|Herts County League]] Western Division.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/ST-ALBAC.HTM|title=Football Club History Database - St Albans City|website=www.fchd.info|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> City were champions of the Spartan League Eastern Division and the Herts County League Western Division in 1909-10.<ref name=\":0\" /> St Albans joined the Athenian League in 1920 and won the Athenian League in 1920-21 and 1921-22.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stalbanscityfc.com/timeline/|title=Timeline|website=St Albans City F.C.|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref> \n\nCity's most famous match was arguably on 22 November 1922 in a fourth round qualifying [[FA Cup]] match.

There were rumours at the time of the promotion that St Albans were possibly moving to a larger venue. However, nothing was confirmed or denied.\n\n===2006\u201307 season===\n\nThe Saints' first three games in the Conference were a mixed affair, with the team winning, drawing and losing their first three games respectively. After then St Albans had a poor run of games and were hovering around the relegation zone. Their hopes being restricted by being a part-time team whilst going up against full-time opponents. However, Colin Lippiatt remained positive about his team's chances. Having been knocked out in the [[FA Cup]] 4th Qualifying Round by [[Yeading F.C.|Yeading]], the team's concentration was focused on staying in the Conference.\n\nSt Albans started the second half of the season just one place off the relegation zone. In terms of transfers, The Saints allowed defender Dave Theobald to return to the [[Conference North]] team [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]], but they re-signed defender Djoumin Sangare on loan from [[Grays Athletic F.C.|Grays Athletic]] until the end of the season. Lippiatt also signed Chris Watters and [[Leon Archer]] from neighbours [[Boreham Wood F.C.|Boreham Wood]] for an undisclosed fee on two-year contracts.\n\nIn January 2007, director (and chief football writer for ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'') Ian Ridley left the club amid disagreement over policy. Ridley argued that the club needed to bring in older, more experienced players (citing [[Steve Claridge]]) to bolster the campaign to stay in the Conference; the remainder of the board wanted to maintain a strong reliance of \"young, hungry\" players.<ref>[http://www.stalbansobserver.co.uk/sport/localsport/display.var.1101944.0.city_director_quits.php The St.Albans Observer-reliance of \"young, hungry\" players]\n</ref>\nSt Albans continued throughout the new year with a run of poor results. On 9 April 2007 (Easter Monday), a 1\u20131 draw with [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]] guaranteed St Albans relegation from the Conference and the team finished bottom of the table.\nThe Saints were the first team to be relegated from the Conference, but were later joined by Southport, Tamworth and Altrincham.\n\nIn addition to the Saints returning to the Conference South Colin Lippiatt resigned as manager at the end of the season. In a statement he stated that it was 'right and proper' for him to leave. He has since rejoined Conference side [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] (where he was once manager) as a director.\n\n===Back to the Conference South===\nAfter relegation to the [[Conference South]], St Albans appointed inexperienced [[Ritchie Hanlon]] as their new manager, who had only retired through injury in January. He had a huge task to rebuild the squad; [[Nick Roddis]] had left the club after finding out that he would not be interviewed for the vacant manager position, Chris Watters rejoined his old club [[Boreham Wood F.C.|Boreham Wood]] for a nominal fee, only 5 months after joining the Saints. Goalkeeper [[Paul Bastock]] was released by 'mutual consent', later joining [[Rushden & Diamonds F.C.|Rushden & Diamonds]].\n\nMore players where to leave Clarence Park as Striker Leon Archer joined [[Braintree Town F.C.|Braintree Town]] and Midfielder Tom Davis joined [[Lewes F.C.|Lewes]], after both made it clear that they did not want to play for St Albans. Dean Cracknell also left the club to join [[Hemel Hempstead Town F.C.|Hemel Hempstead]]. Hanlon however bolstered the squad with numerous new signings, Gary Burrell joined from [[Heybridge Swifts]], [[Mark Beard (footballer)|Mark Beard]] joined from [[Stevenage Borough F.C.|Stevenage Borough]] as player/assistant manager, Paul Bruce joined from [[Dagenham & Redbridge]] & [[So Solid Crew]] Rapper, Former [[AFC Wimbledon]] player [[Michael Harvey (musician)|Junior Harvey]] was recruited, another player from Dagenham & Redbridge was brought in, Nick Eyre, signed to replace Veteran [[Paul Bastock]]. This was backed up with two youth signings, Hector Mackie & Reis Noel, and finally Hanlon added Hassan Sulaiman & Paul Semakula to the ranks.\n\nNot long into October after a bad string of results, Richie Hanlon was sacked as St Albans manager. Former Hendon and AFC Wimbledon manager [[Dave Anderson (footballer)|Dave Anderson]] was given the role, and has since taken City to one win at Bromley and a draw. He has wasted no time in adjusting the squad and has signed Jon Stevenson and Gary O'Connor amongst others. Anderson became another managerial casualty after the 4\u20130 New Year defeat to [[Cambridge City F.C.|Cambridge City]].\n\nEngland U19 scout and former City boss [[Steve Castle]] was next put in the position, and he declared his ambition to bring former players of the Saints back to Clarence Park. This prompted rumours of returns for Matt Hann and [[Patrick Ada]] amongst others. On 8 January, Castle signed Dean Cracknell and Simon Martin, who are both former Saints.\n\nThings began to look up for the team, with goalkeeper [[Paul Bastock]], who was later voted Player of the Season by fans, rejoining from [[Rushden and Diamonds]], helping City to long unbeaten run. Included in this run of results was the 2\u20130 victory over top of the league Lewes, thanks to Paul Hakim and a stunner from [[Lee Clarke]], later voted goal of the season. Soon City were on the tail of Weston Super Mare for survival.\n\nWith a stunning 3\u20132 victory over playoff chasers [[Eastleigh| Eastleigh Town F.C.]] secured their safety in the [[Conference South]]. Eastleigh brought many a fan to Clarence Park with drums and all, and they took the lead when former Saint Matt Hann went down in the box and Eastleigh converted the penalty. The Eastleigh fans went wild, and they maintained the lead and their singing voices until half time. In the second half city loanee [[Bradley Gray]] equalised with a shot from the edge of the area that squeezed inside the post, before [[Akanni-Sunday Wasiu]] put City ahead moments later. By now the City fans were going crazy, and the result seemed beyond doubt when Sunday completed his brace. Another former Saint, Steve Watts, scored a great effort but City survive in both the game and the lead.\n\n===2008\u201309 season===\nAfter retaining many of the previous season's squad, Steve Castle set promotion as a target for the team, after deciding to stay on himself. St Albans did not start brilliantly, failing to win in the first few games. However, the Saints recovered to begin a run of 7 wins to see them climb into the playoff positions. Paul Hakim scored many goals for City during this time, further rekindling his relationship with the fans.\nWhen the run ended, City went on a run of three games without winning, dropping to mid-table.\n\nIn the FA Trophy, the Saints saw off [[Dartford F.C.|Dartford]] before meeting local rivals [[Stevenage Borough F.C.|Stevenage Borough]] in the next round. Saints lost 4\u20131, conceding three goals in the last ten minutes.\n\n===2009\u201310 season&nbsp;\u2013 financial worries===\nIn Summer 2009, it was announced that Gibson's building firm, William Verry, were to go into administration with debts mounting continuously. Gibson himself released a statement in regards to the club's future,<ref>[http://www.sacfc.co.uk/content/view/897/334/ Statement From John Gibson-Wednesday, 29 April 2009]</ref> stating that it was safe. In the month that followed Gibson released another statement regarding the club's finances<ref>[http://www.sacfc.co.uk/content/view/925/334/ Statement From John Gibson-Wednesday, 15 July 2009]</ref> Following this statement there were rumours of buy outs by a rival building firm who had taken on a number of William Verry's contracts. This apparently was unfounded. Another interested party was apparently [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] central defender [[Darren Ward (footballer born 1978)|Darren Ward]].\n\n===2010\u201312===\nThe summer of 2010 went somewhat smoother for the Saints, as the financial worries that had plagued the team in 2009 had, thankfully, not returned, and Steve Castle was able to get on with assembling his squad for the new season, albeit with one of the smallest budgets in the league.\n\nPre-season friendlies were lined up with the likes of Watford and Leyton Orient, before the Saints kicked off their [[Conference South]] season with a trip to Thurrock in mid-August. In the week leading up to the game, City were boosted by the return of former Saints favourites Ben Martin and Hassan Sulaiman, who joined other key players Pete Smith, Paul Bastock and Drew Roberts in the new squad.\n\nCity opened their account for the season with a 2\u20132 draw with the Fleet, with goals from Roberts and the newly improved Inih Effiong setting them up with a two-goal lead, before being pegged back before full-time. Despite missing the chance to win, it was considered a good point away from home, against strong opposition.\n\nWith the signing of Adam Martin completed, meaning he joined Robbie and Ben on the club's list of 'Martins', the Saints continued their campaign with the visit of Basingstoke Town. A closely fought encounter ended 0\u20130, although the Saints had a good chance to scrape the game when Drew Roberts squared for Inih Effiong, only for the big striker to slip in the sodden conditions before firing wide.\n\nThe Saints' third match of the season was another home encounter&nbsp;\u2013 this time with the much-changed Braintree Town. City's veteran goalkeeper Paul Bastock was in sparkling form to twice deny Braintree from close range, as the Saints ground out another goalless draw. St. Albans' best chance of the game fell to winger Joe Richards, whose close range header was clawed out by the Irons stopper, thus leaving City with three points from three games, and extending their Conference South unbeaten run to four games, including last season's final day draw with Bath City.\n\nOn 4 February 2011, the F.A. fined St. Albans \u00a37,500 and deducted 10 league points. The punishment was handed down to City chairman John Gibson and then vice-chairman Alasdair McMillin during a Regulatory Hearing at the Association's offices at Wembley, and was in relation to alleged illegal payments to players, described by the FA as financial irregularities, by the club during the 2008\u201309 season.<ref>[http://www.thefa.com/TheFA/Disciplinary/NewsAndFeatures/2011/st-albans-040211 TheFA.com&nbsp;\u2013 St Albans City fined and deducted points]</ref> St. Albans appealed, but the original decision was upheld.\n\nSt. Albans were relegated on 9 April 2011 after losing 4\u20130 to Ebbsfleet United, they will play in the [[Southern League Premier Division]] in season 2011/12\n\nOn 12 May 2011, it was announced that local businessmen Lawrence Levy and John Mcgowan had bought the club from previous chairman John Gibson for an undisclosed fee. They revealed that they will be looking for someone with plenty of football knowledge and experience to take over the position of chairman.\n\nOn 10 June 2011, manager [[Steve Castle]] was released after many weeks of speculation. His successor was announced on 18 June to be former [[Harrow Borough F.C.|Harrow Borough]] manager [[David Howell (footballer)|David Howell]] who has recently taken Harrow to the play-offs in the [[Isthmian League]] Premier Division.\n\n===2011\u20132012===\nNow playing in the [[Southern League Premier Division]] for the first time in their history and at their lowest level for 20+ years, the saints weren't considered one of the favourites for the division although a late surge in late Jan and Feb took the club to the brink of the play-offs, however only 1 win in the final 5 games meant St Albans finished 8th.<ref>http://www.sacfc.co.uk/index.php/teams/first-team/fixtures-results.html</ref>\n\n===2012\u20132013===\n[[David Howell (footballer)|David Howell]] started the season with a much improved budget and St Albans were among the favourites for the division signing players like [[Barry Hayles]], despite starting the season well, a slump in October and November which also saw early exits in the FA Cup and FA Trophy saw [[David Howell (footballer)|David Howell]] sacked and youth team coaches James Gray and Graham Golds take over, initially as a caretaker management team, however the performances improved with some better football and they were given the job full-time. However several players left over the Christmas period and the owners introduced a controversial decision to up the admission prices mid-season.<ref>http://www.hertsad.co.uk/sport/football/saints_surprised_after_chairman_ian_ridley_resigns_1_1700363</ref> St Albans finished 11th\n\n===2013\u20132014===\nThe 2013\u20132014 season was a major success with pre-season signings of the calibre of John Frendo who was the league's top scorer the previous season.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southern-football-league.co.uk/statistics/stats_1213/scorers/premier.asp?section=statistics |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616045240/http://www.southern-football-league.co.uk/statistics/stats_1213/scorers/premier.asp?section=statistics |archivedate=16 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After an indifferent start that saw St Albans lose 4 games up to the end of September, it was the arrival of Rambir Marwa in midfield that saw a change in fortunes. St Albans made the FA Cup 1st Round for the 1st time since 2002 losing 8\u20131 at home to [[Mansfield Town]] in front of 3000+ supporters and they also made the FA Trophy 2nd Round losing to eventual winners [[Cambridge United]]. A new record of away wins without defeat was also set (16). St Albans finished the season 4th and won the play-offs defeating [[Chesham United]] 3\u20131 in the final in front of 2900 fans.\n\n===2014\u20132015===\nSt Albans returned to the [[Conference South]] and finished 13th.

It was founded in 1908 and plays its home matches at [[Clarence Park (St Albans)|Clarence Park]], about 800 yards from the city centre.\n\nThe club currently competes in the [[National League South]] (previously known as the [[Conference South]]), the sixth tier of English football. It competed in the [[Conference Premier]] (now the [[National League (division)|National League]]) during the 2006\u201307 season, but was relegated back to the Conference South after one season and subsequently suffered a further relegation in 2010\u201311, before returning to the sixth tier in 2013\u201314 after beating [[Chesham United FC]] 3\u20131 in the play-off final.\n\nCity's most famous match was arguably on 22 November 1922 in a fourth round qualifying [[FA Cup]] match. Having been held by [[Dulwich Hamlet]] to a 1\u20131 draw at Clarence Park on 18 November, the replay drew a gate of 4,060. City's [[New Zealand]]-born goalkeeper W. Tennant did not appear, his place taken by Alf Fearn who was usually a half-back with the reserves. Dulwich put eight goals past him, the winning goal coming in near darkness at the end of [[extra time]]. What put the game in the record books was that City scored seven times, with all seven goals being scored by [[Wilfred Minter]]. His feat remains the highest tally by a player on the losing side of an FA Cup tie.\n\n==History==\n{{recentism|date=February 2012}}\n\n=== Early history ===\nFormed in April 1908, St Albans City FC became members both the [[Spartan League]] Eastern Division and the [[Hertfordshire Senior County League|Herts County League]] Western Division.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/ST-ALBAC.HTM|title=Football Club History Database - St Albans City|website=www.fchd.info|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref> City were champions of the Spartan League Eastern Division and the Herts County League Western Division in 1909-10.<ref name=\":0\" /> St Albans joined the Athenian League in 1920 and won the Athenian League in 1920-21 and 1921-22.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stalbanscityfc.com/timeline/|title=Timeline|website=St Albans City F.C.|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref> \n\nCity's most famous match was arguably on 22 November 1922 in a fourth round qualifying [[FA Cup]] match.

There were rumours at the time of the promotion that St Albans were possibly moving to a larger venue. However, nothing was confirmed or denied.\n\n===2006\u201307 season===\n\nThe Saints' first three games in the Conference were a mixed affair, with the team winning, drawing and losing their first three games respectively. After then St Albans had a poor run of games and were hovering around the relegation zone. Their hopes being restricted by being a part-time team whilst going up against full-time opponents. However, Colin Lippiatt remained positive about his team's chances. Having been knocked out in the [[FA Cup]] 4th Qualifying Round by [[Yeading F.C.|Yeading]], the team's concentration was focused on staying in the Conference.\n\nSt Albans started the second half of the season just one place off the relegation zone. In terms of transfers, The Saints allowed defender Dave Theobald to return to the [[Conference North]] team [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]], but they re-signed defender Djoumin Sangare on loan from [[Grays Athletic F.C.|Grays Athletic]] until the end of the season. Lippiatt also signed Chris Watters and [[Leon Archer]] from neighbours [[Boreham Wood F.C.|Boreham Wood]] for an undisclosed fee on two-year contracts.\n\nIn January 2007, director (and chief football writer for ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'') Ian Ridley left the club amid disagreement over policy. Ridley argued that the club needed to bring in older, more experienced players (citing [[Steve Claridge]]) to bolster the campaign to stay in the Conference; the remainder of the board wanted to maintain a strong reliance of \"young, hungry\" players.<ref>[http://www.stalbansobserver.co.uk/sport/localsport/display.var.1101944.0.city_director_quits.php The St.Albans Observer-reliance of \"young, hungry\" players]\n</ref>\nSt Albans continued throughout the new year with a run of poor results. On 9 April 2007 (Easter Monday), a 1\u20131 draw with [[Tamworth F.C.|Tamworth]] guaranteed St Albans relegation from the Conference and the team finished bottom of the table.\nThe Saints were the first team to be relegated from the Conference, but were later joined by Southport, Tamworth and Altrincham.\n\nIn addition to the Saints returning to the Conference South Colin Lippiatt resigned as manager at the end of the season. In a statement he stated that it was 'right and proper' for him to leave. He has since rejoined Conference side [[Woking F.C.|Woking]] (where he was once manager) as a director.\n\n===Back to the Conference South===\nAfter relegation to the [[Conference South]], St Albans appointed inexperienced [[Ritchie Hanlon]] as their new manager, who had only retired through injury in January. He had a huge task to rebuild the squad; [[Nick Roddis]] had left the club after finding out that he would not be interviewed for the vacant manager position, Chris Watters rejoined his old club [[Boreham Wood F.C.|Boreham Wood]] for a nominal fee, only 5 months after joining the Saints. Goalkeeper [[Paul Bastock]] was released by 'mutual consent', later joining [[Rushden & Diamonds F.C.|Rushden & Diamonds]].\n\nMore players where to leave Clarence Park as Striker Leon Archer joined [[Braintree Town F.C.|Braintree Town]] and Midfielder Tom Davis joined [[Lewes F.C.|Lewes]], after both made it clear that they did not want to play for St Albans. Dean Cracknell also left the club to join [[Hemel Hempstead Town F.C.|Hemel Hempstead]]. Hanlon however bolstered the squad with numerous new signings, Gary Burrell joined from [[Heybridge Swifts]], [[Mark Beard (footballer)|Mark Beard]] joined from [[Stevenage Borough F.C.|Stevenage Borough]] as player/assistant manager, Paul Bruce joined from [[Dagenham & Redbridge]] & [[So Solid Crew]] Rapper, Former [[AFC Wimbledon]] player [[Michael Harvey (musician)|Junior Harvey]] was recruited, another player from Dagenham & Redbridge was brought in, Nick Eyre, signed to replace Veteran [[Paul Bastock]]. This was backed up with two youth signings, Hector Mackie & Reis Noel, and finally Hanlon added Hassan Sulaiman & Paul Semakula to the ranks.\n\nNot long into October after a bad string of results, Richie Hanlon was sacked as St Albans manager. Former Hendon and AFC Wimbledon manager [[Dave Anderson (footballer)|Dave Anderson]] was given the role, and has since taken City to one win at Bromley and a draw. He has wasted no time in adjusting the squad and has signed Jon Stevenson and Gary O'Connor amongst others. Anderson became another managerial casualty after the 4\u20130 New Year defeat to [[Cambridge City F.C.|Cambridge City]].\n\nEngland U19 scout and former City boss [[Steve Castle]] was next put in the position, and he declared his ambition to bring former players of the Saints back to Clarence Park. This prompted rumours of returns for Matt Hann and [[Patrick Ada]] amongst others. On 8 January, Castle signed Dean Cracknell and Simon Martin, who are both former Saints.\n\nThings began to look up for the team, with goalkeeper [[Paul Bastock]], who was later voted Player of the Season by fans, rejoining from [[Rushden and Diamonds]], helping City to long unbeaten run. Included in this run of results was the 2\u20130 victory over top of the league Lewes, thanks to Paul Hakim and a stunner from [[Lee Clarke]], later voted goal of the season. Soon City were on the tail of Weston Super Mare for survival.\n\nWith a stunning 3\u20132 victory over playoff chasers [[Eastleigh| Eastleigh Town F.C.]] secured their safety in the [[Conference South]]. Eastleigh brought many a fan to Clarence Park with drums and all, and they took the lead when former Saint Matt Hann went down in the box and Eastleigh converted the penalty. The Eastleigh fans went wild, and they maintained the lead and their singing voices until half time. In the second half city loanee [[Bradley Gray]] equalised with a shot from the edge of the area that squeezed inside the post, before [[Akanni-Sunday Wasiu]] put City ahead moments later. By now the City fans were going crazy, and the result seemed beyond doubt when Sunday completed his brace. Another former Saint, Steve Watts, scored a great effort but City survive in both the game and the lead.\n\n===2008\u201309 season===\nAfter retaining many of the previous season's squad, Steve Castle set promotion as a target for the team, after deciding to stay on himself. St Albans did not start brilliantly, failing to win in the first few games. However, the Saints recovered to begin a run of 7 wins to see them climb into the playoff positions. Paul Hakim scored many goals for City during this time, further rekindling his relationship with the fans.\nWhen the run ended, City went on a run of three games without winning, dropping to mid-table.\n\nIn the FA Trophy, the Saints saw off [[Dartford F.C.|Dartford]] before meeting local rivals [[Stevenage Borough F.C.|Stevenage Borough]] in the next round. Saints lost 4\u20131, conceding three goals in the last ten minutes.\n\n===2009\u201310 season&nbsp;\u2013 financial worries===\nIn Summer 2009, it was announced that Gibson's building firm, William Verry, were to go into administration with debts mounting continuously. Gibson himself released a statement in regards to the club's future,<ref>[http://www.sacfc.co.uk/content/view/897/334/ Statement From John Gibson-Wednesday, 29 April 2009]</ref> stating that it was safe. In the month that followed Gibson released another statement regarding the club's finances<ref>[http://www.sacfc.co.uk/content/view/925/334/ Statement From John Gibson-Wednesday, 15 July 2009]</ref> Following this statement there were rumours of buy outs by a rival building firm who had taken on a number of William Verry's contracts. This apparently was unfounded. Another interested party was apparently [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] central defender [[Darren Ward (footballer born 1978)|Darren Ward]].\n\n===2010\u201312===\nThe summer of 2010 went somewhat smoother for the Saints, as the financial worries that had plagued the team in 2009 had, thankfully, not returned, and Steve Castle was able to get on with assembling his squad for the new season, albeit with one of the smallest budgets in the league.\n\nPre-season friendlies were lined up with the likes of Watford and Leyton Orient, before the Saints kicked off their [[Conference South]] season with a trip to Thurrock in mid-August. In the week leading up to the game, City were boosted by the return of former Saints favourites Ben Martin and Hassan Sulaiman, who joined other key players Pete Smith, Paul Bastock and Drew Roberts in the new squad.\n\nCity opened their account for the season with a 2\u20132 draw with the Fleet, with goals from Roberts and the newly improved Inih Effiong setting them up with a two-goal lead, before being pegged back before full-time. Despite missing the chance to win, it was considered a good point away from home, against strong opposition.\n\nWith the signing of Adam Martin completed, meaning he joined Robbie and Ben on the club's list of 'Martins', the Saints continued their campaign with the visit of Basingstoke Town. A closely fought encounter ended 0\u20130, although the Saints had a good chance to scrape the game when Drew Roberts squared for Inih Effiong, only for the big striker to slip in the sodden conditions before firing wide.\n\nThe Saints' third match of the season was another home encounter&nbsp;\u2013 this time with the much-changed Braintree Town. City's veteran goalkeeper Paul Bastock was in sparkling form to twice deny Braintree from close range, as the Saints ground out another goalless draw. St. Albans' best chance of the game fell to winger Joe Richards, whose close range header was clawed out by the Irons stopper, thus leaving City with three points from three games, and extending their Conference South unbeaten run to four games, including last season's final day draw with Bath City.\n\nOn 4 February 2011, the F.A. fined St. Albans \u00a37,500 and deducted 10 league points.

{"title_page": "History of Crystal Palace F.C.", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=July 2012}}\n\n[[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace Football Club]] is a professional [[association football|football]] club based in [[Selhurst]], [[South London]], England. They were formed in 1905 at the site of the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]], although an amateur [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team did play here as early as 1861. The club played their home games at the Crystal Palace [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final stadium]] for the first ten years of their existence before they were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]], and eventually moved to their current home at [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924.\n\nShortly after their formation, the club applied to gain election to the [[Football League]] but missed out by one vote. They instead joined the [[Southern Football League]] Second Division and were champions in their first season. The club played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years. The Football League was restructured in 1920 which saw the majority of the Southern League First Division forming a new [[Football League Third Division]] which Palace became founder members of. At the end of the season Palace were crowned champions and gained promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. After four seasons they suffered relegation to what was then the [[Third Division South]] and remained here until the Football League was restructured which saw Palace become founder members of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1958. Over the next eleven years, under the chairmanship of [[Arthur Wait]], the club progressed up to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], then the top flight of English football. Palace also achieved distinction in 1962 when the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era played for the first time in London in a friendly match at Selhurst Park. In 1973, the manager at that time [[Bert Head]] was moved upstairs to take the position of general manager. [[Malcolm Allison]] was brought in as team manager, but Palace were relegated back to the Second Division, and then to the Third in consecutive seasons. Allison instigated a number of changes at the club, their original nickname was changed from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\" and they ended the 68-year association with claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. \n\nAt the end of the [[1975\u201376 Football League|1975\u201376]] season, Allison left the club, and [[Terry Venables]] became manager taking Palace back to the top flight with promotions in 1977 and 1979. The period between 1989\u201391, under chairman [[Ron Noades]] and manager [[Steve Coppell]], saw the club reach the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], and finish in third place in the top division in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season, only missing out on European qualification due to the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Palace became founder members of the [[Premier League]] in 1992, but were relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club bounced between the top two divisions during the rest of the 1990s, and enjoyed runs to the semi-finals of both the [[Football League Cup|League]] and [[FA Cup|FA]] Cups in 1995, before suffering [[Administration (law)|administration]] under the chairmanship of [[Mark Goldberg]]. Under new owner [[Simon Jordan]] the club spent much of its time in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] over the next ten years with a brief spell in the Premier League during [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]]. Another administration in 2010 saw the club emerge owned by a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans led by [[Steve Parish (businessman)|Steve Parish]]. Palace then achieved promotion back to the Premier League via the [[Football League play-offs]] in 2013, and have since maintained their place among the elite and also reached the [[2016 FA Cup Final]].\n\n==Origins and formation (1854\u20131905)==\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|right|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\nBetween 1852 and 1854, the glass exhibition building known as [[The Crystal Palace]] was relocated from [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] \u2013 including the [[Crystal Palace Park|park]] surrounding the site, where various sports facilities were built. The earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] football team first played here in 1861 as an amateur outfit.<ref>The Origin of Crystal Palace FC, Volume I. Steve Martyniuk 2016.</ref> They went on to become founder members of [[the Football Association]] and competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]] reaching the [[FA Cup Semi-finals|semi-finals]] where they were eliminated by the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]] in a replay after the first game ended goalless. The team also played in the FA Cup in the next four seasons before disappearing from historical records after a 0\u20133 defeat to eventual winners [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the [[1875\u201376 FA Cup|1875\u201376]] FA Cup. In 1895, the Football Association adopted a new permanent home for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] which was to be played at the sports stadium situated inside the historic grounds of the Palace. With the owners also reliant on tourist activity for their income, they sought fresh attractions for the venue, and founded the [[London County Cricket Club]] of [[W. G. Grace]] before turning their attention to football.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;11\u201313</ref>\n\nThe idea of a new club playing at the Crystal Palace stadium was proposed in 1904 by the Crystal Palace Company. The proposal was rejected by the Football Association, who disliked the idea that the owners of the Cup Final venue would also possess their own football club. However a separate company was established the following year to form the club under the chairmanship of [[Sydney Bourne]], who was chosen due to his propensity in buying tickets to the Cup Final.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\n==Southern League (1905\u201320)==\n{{see also|1905 in association football}}\n\n[[File:Crystal palace fc 1905-06.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Crystal Palace squad of 1905\u201306.]]\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club was founded on 10 September 1905,<ref name=CPOS>{{cite web|last=Byfield |first=Terry |title=History |url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ |publisher=Crystal Palace Football Club |accessdate=27 May 2013 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6e96TrN?url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> playing in the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] colours of claret and blue.<ref name=RG1>{{cite book|last=Mitten|first=Andy|title=The Rough Guide to Cult Football|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781848365421|url-access=registration|year=2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|isbn=1-4053-8796-3}}</ref> The choice of colours was a result of the important role in the club's formation played by [[Edmund Goodman]], an Aston Villa employee who was recommended to the fledgling club by the Villa chairman, [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]].

Unfortunately, it was Chelsea that were accepted, and the club were forced to settle for a place in the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] Second Division.<ref name=ADDI /> To increase the number of club fixtures, Palace also joined the mid-week United Counties League.<ref name=ADDI /> Robson established a team of sixteen professionals, mainly drawn from Middlesbrough. The club's inaugural campaign, which consisted mainly of matches against other clubs' reserve sides, alongside [[Southall F.C.|Southall]], [[Southern United F.C.|Southern United]], [[Hastings & St Leonards United F.C.|St. Leonards United]] and [[Grays United F.C.|Grays United]],<ref name=ADDI /> was a successful one. Their opening match was against [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] Reserves, and approximately 3,000 people paid 6d to stand or a shilling to be seated. Palace led 3\u20130 after 30 minutes, before fading and losing 3\u20134. However, that was the club's only defeat in the league all season, and Palace won the championship and were promoted to the Southern League First Division. The season included a run of seventeen straight victories, one of them being a 9\u20131 win over Grays United. The crowd attendances for the season were regularly between 2,000 and 3,000 although 4,000 attended the 4\u20130 defeat of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] Reserves in March.<ref>Matthews, p.14</ref>\n\nFollowing their championship win, Palace started their second season as a club in the Southern League First Division, placing nineteenth at the end of the season but enjoying better form in the FA Cup. Beating [[Rotherham County F.C.|Rotherham County]] in a qualifying tie, Palace were then drawn away to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the First Round proper. Newcastle had played in the previous two FA Cup Finals, were league champions in 1905 and were on their way to another title. In what still stands as one of the club's greatest ever wins, Palace scored through [[Horace Astley]] against the run of play and then held off Newcastle to come away with a shock [[Newcastle United F.C. 0\u20131 Crystal Palace F.C. (1907)|1\u20130]] win. The second and third rounds saw Palace dispose of [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] respectively, the latter after a replay, and the quarter-finals saw Palace drawn at home to First Division club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], who were flying high in second place. In front of a record crowd of 35,000, Palace took the lead, but their opponents equalised taking the tie to a replay, where Everton proved too strong, running out 4\u20130 winners.<ref>Matthews, pp.15\u201316</ref>\n\n[[File:Ted Smith goal for Crystal Palace circa 1914.jpg|thumb|500px|right|A headed goal scored by [[Edwin Smith (footballer)|Edwin Smith]] from a [[Billy Davies (Welsh footballer)|Billy Davies]] cross against [[Reading F.C.]], c.&nbsp;1914]]\nJohn Robson left Palace to manage neighbours [[Croydon Common F.C.]] for the 1907\u201308 season, and Edmund Goodman took over as manager and club secretary. The club had a good season, finishing fourth. [[Billy Davies (Welsh footballer)|Bill Davies]] became the first player from the club to be capped at international level when he was called up for [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. The club could not sustain their league form the following season, finishing in a disappointing sixteenth place. In the FA Cup Palace lost 0\u20139 to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in a second round replay, which was a record defeat for the club. Palace managed to finish fourth again in the league the following season, losing just one game in the first twelve, and repeated their fourth-place finish the season after, with league attendances as high as 12,000. The club won the [[London Challenge Cup]] in 1913, overcoming [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 1\u20130. After seventh and fifth-place finishes, Palace enjoyed good form in the 1913\u201314 season, with the club putting together some long unbeaten runs and finishing the season runners-up to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] on goal average. They also retained the London Challenge Cup, defeating [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 2\u20131 at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]], and provided their first [[England national football team|England]] representative in [[Horace Colclough]], who played in the team that beat Wales in Cardiff on 16 March.<ref>Matthews, pp.16\u201319</ref>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First World War]] on 4 August 1914, Palace had three players called up as [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Reservists]] before the season started. Former Palace players [[Ginger Williams (footballer)|Ginger Williams]] and [[Joe Bulcock]] were amongst those killed in the conflict. In March 1915, [[The Admiralty]], who had taken over the Palace and its grounds at the start of the war, ordered the club to leave and Palace chose to move to [[Herne Hill Velodrome]]. When Croydon Common F.C. failed to return to business after the war, Palace moved to their ground known as [[The Nest (stadium)|The Nest]] which was opposite [[Selhurst railway station]]. In the first full season after the war, Palace finished in third place in 1919\u201320.<ref>Matthews, pp.19, 23\u201326</ref>\n\n==The Football League (1920\u201358)==\nCrystal Palace became a Football League club in 1920 when the Southern League First Division clubs were admitted ''en bloc'' as founder members of a newly formed Football League [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. In their first season as a Football League club, Palace lost their opening game at [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] 1\u20132 with A.G. Milligan scoring the club's first ever Football League goal. Milligan's Palace career was short-lived however, and he made just one more appearance for the club. Palace's first ever home Football League match was a disappointing 0\u20130 draw against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], but the club then went on a run of six consecutive wins. Goalkeeper [[Jack Alderson]], who had been signed in 1919, kept a clean sheet in all of those wins and Palace lost just six more games all season. They were unbeaten in the final sixteen games of the season which included an eight-game winning streak and went on to win the championship by five points from Southampton. The feat earned them promotion to the Second Division. The club conceded just thirty four goals over the season, a record that stood until 1978\u201379,<ref>Matthews, p.26, 28</ref> and they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to have won a championship in their first season as a league club. Palace also won their third London Challenge Cup, beating [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]] 1\u20130 at [[White Hart Lane]] with a goal from forward [[John Conner (footballer)|John Conner]].<ref>Matthews, p.29</ref>\n\n[[File:Jack Alderson Caricature 1922.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Goalkeeper [[Jack Alderson]], caricatured in the ''Football Special'' in 1922.

This arrangement would continue until 1958 when the Third and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]<nowiki/> were formed, but for now Palace were above all of that, and in 1921 they opened their second season in the Football League as a Second Division club, finishing in fourteenth place. The highest attendance of the season was 20,000 for the match against Fulham. Palace remained in the lower reaches of the table during the following season, 1922\u201323, eventually finishing fifteenth. The club also made a significant purchase that season with regards to a new permanent home.<ref>Matthews, pp.29\u201330</ref>\n\nBack in 1919, the Palace minute book contained an entry instructing the Secretary to investigate the possibility of obtaining a lease on the 'ground at Selhurst', although calling it a 'ground' was a little misleading since at the time it was a piece of wasteland valuable only to the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway|London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company]]. At one time it had been a brickfield, and two chimney stacks still remained. On 3 January 1922 the club purchased the ground at a cost of \u00a32,750, and renowned football ground architect [[Archibald Leitch]] was commissioned to design [[Selhurst Park]]. Leitch had designed stands at [[Craven Cottage]], [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], White Hart Lane and [[Leeds Road, Huddersfield|Leeds Road]], but the design for Selhurst Park was unusual in that it had no roof gable. The other three sides of the ground remained open banking with just the lower parts being terraced. Construction work was delayed by industrial disputes, and when the ground was opened by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] on the 30 August 1924, the stand had not been completed. It did however boast many luxuries, including \"offices, tea rooms, training quarters, plunge, slipper shower and needle baths\". The opening fixture was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]], and in front of a crowd of 25,000, Palace lost 0\u20131, with the first goal at Selhurst Park being scored by Billy Marsden. That defeat set the tone for the season, with the club eventually finishing in twenty-first place \u2013 and were relegated along with [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. A win in the last game at home to [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] would have secured survival, but Palace went down 0\u20131 and it would be almost 40 years before Palace would again grace the second level of English football. One small consolation was the decision by the FA to stage the England versus Wales international at Selhurst Park on 1 March 1926. It remains the only full international match to be staged at the ground.<ref>Matthews, pp.30, 33\u201335</ref>\n\nAfter one season in the Third Division South and eighteen in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted to plot Palace's climb back up the table. However, their stay in the division was to last as long as the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it was a difficult division to get out of, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Third Division South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth and also finished runners-up no less than three times. At the start of the 1939\u201340 season, Palace were sitting second in the table, but the season was cancelled after just three matches with the onset of the [[Second World War]].<ref>Matthews, pp.35\u201336, 39\u201346</ref>\n\nThe war years of 1939\u201345 saw football enter a period of disarray with the creation of [[Wartime League]]s. Palace joined the South \"A\" Division in 1939, but also joined the South League \"D\" in 1940, winning the latter competition, and then promptly winning an improvised South Regional League the following season on goal average. Palace joined the London League for the 1941\u201342 season, with the clubs in London refusing to accept the ad-hoc competitions the Football League were organising. This division only lasted that season before the London clubs were back in the Football League fold, with Palace joining the Football League South for the next four seasons.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.57-61\">Matthews, p.&nbsp;57\u201361</ref> The club fielded 186 different players during the seven wartime seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10323~754182,00.html |title=Palace During WWII |accessdate=27 March 2009 |publisher=Crystal Palace |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214005340/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10323~754182%2C00.html |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nKit changes had been introduced in the late 1930s. The 1937\u201338 season saw Palace field a shirt of claret and blue stripes, before adopting white shirts and black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to claret and blue in 1948\u201349, but any attempt at changing the kit to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing bottom and applying for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]] for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed the kit back to white shirts and black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another bottom place and re-election in 1950\u201351, with the unwanted record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in the bottom half of the table until the league was restructured in 1958\u201359, requiring re-election for a third and final time in 1955\u201356, with only Swindon keeping them from bottom spot that season.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.57-61\"/>\n\n==Rising through the divisions (1958\u201373)==\nThe 1958\u201359 season began a period of change, with [[Arthur Wait]] taking control of the club as chairman and the league was restructured with Palace playing in the new Fourth Division. This new division had been formed with the merging of the clubs in the bottom half of Third Division South with those in the bottom half of Third Division North. Palace had failed to qualify for the new Third Division, falling outside the top twelve finish required by two places. Their first season in the Fourth Division saw Palace finish seventh, with the club faring slightly worse the following season with an eighth place finish. Wait appointed the ex-Tottenham manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960 and the club then enjoyed a successful 1960\u201361 season, finishing second behind league newcomers [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], who thus matched Palace's 1920\u201321 achievement of winning a championship in their inaugural league season. Palace also set Fourth Division records for the highest average attendance of 19,092, and the highest attendance at an individual match; 37,774 for the Good Friday game at Selhurst Park against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm |title=Division Four 1960/61 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6eJurvH?url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Surrey-born [[Johnny Byrne (footballer)|Johnny Byrne]] scored 31 of Palace's 110 goals, and his strike partner [[Roy Summersby]] netted 25 as Palace moved up to Division Three.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;79\u201380, 87\u201390</ref>\n\nPalace finished fifteenth in Division Three at the end of the 1961\u201362 season. In November, Johnny Byrne was called up to the England team, despite playing outside the top two divisions at the time, one of only five players ever to achieve this. He played the whole of the 1\u20131 draw against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]], part of the [[1961\u201362 British Home Championship|1962 British Home Championship]], at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. After international recognition, the West Ham manager [[Ron Greenwood]] paid a British record transfer fee of \u00a365,000 and ex-Palace striker [[Ron Brett]] in exchange to take \"Budgie\" to the Hammers in March 1962. This was a record fee between two British clubs at the time.

Johnny Byrne returned to the Palace line-up as a guest player. Madrid ended up 4\u20133 winners. Arthur Rowe resigned due to health reasons in December 1962 and the club appointed former player [[Dick Graham]] as manager. The 1962\u201363 season saw Palace finish eleventh, before gaining promotion to the Second Division the following season after finishing second behind Coventry City on goal average.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;93\u201395</ref> \n\nFor the following four seasons Palace achieved respectable top half finishes in the Second Division, during which they appointed [[Bert Head]] as their new manager in April 1966. Head promoted from the youth team and transferred in players both new and old, delighting the fans by re-signing old favourite Johnny Byrne. His work paid dividends in the 1968\u201369 season when Palace, not fancied as promotion candidates at the beginning of the season, finished second behind [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] who were managed by [[Brian Clough]]. Palace had achieved a place in the top flight for the first time in their history, clinching promotion with a 16-game unbeaten run to end the season.<ref>Matthews, pp.95\u201396, 103\u2013106</ref>\n\n[[The Dave Clark Five|The Dave Clark Five's]] chart-hit \"[[Glad All Over]]\" became a huge crowd favourite at this time with the Palace fans banging on advertising hoardings in time with the drum beat in the chorus of the song.<ref>Sedgwick, Fred. \"[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/26/familyandrelationships.family9 Family: Playlist: The Football Anthems of My Youth].\" The Guardian: 7. 26 May 2007.

Scoring the first Division One goal for the club was [[Mel Blyth]] after six minutes, and a second goal from new signing [[Gerry Queen]] saw Palace hold United to a 2\u20132 draw with goalkeeper [[John Jackson (footballer born 1942)|John Jackson]] denying [[George Best]] and [[Brian Kidd]]. The next match was another home game versus [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] which Palace won 2\u20130. After a season long struggle against relegation, Palace were eventually able to secure safety, finishing in twentieth place above demoted Sheffield Wednesday and Sunderland. The club managed to gain three new records for the First Division at the end of this season: the fewest goals scored; the fewest wins recorded by a non-relegated team; and the tally of twenty-seven points was the smallest number with which a team has avoided relegation from the top flight.<ref>Matthews, 113\u2013115</ref> Palace avoided the drop for two more seasons,<ref>Matthews, 115\u2013121</ref> and followed the trend of many other top flight clubs by introducing a new \"''Player of the Year''\" award which has been presented at the end of every season since the 1971\u201372 campaign. The first recipient was [[John McCormick (footballer, born 1936)|John McCormick]].<ref name=\"POTY\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10323~559565,00.html |title=Player Of The Year |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907141243/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10323~559565%2C00.html |archivedate=7 September 2011 |publisher=cpfc.co.uk (Crystal Palace F.C.) |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite some good performances in the 1972\u201373 season, notably a 5\u20130 home win against Manchester United in December, Palace eventually succumbed to the drop in their fourth season in the top flight. Arthur Wait, having overseen the rise of the club from the Fourth to the First Division, was replaced as chairman by Raymond Bloye in November 1972, and the club also appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as the new manager in March the following year, replacing Bert Head. Although the club saw a record average attendance over the season, neither the crowd nor the managerial change were able to keep them at the top level. Allison's first game in charge at home against Chelsea did see some changes, however, including the debut of young Scottish defender [[Jim Cannon]]. Palace had never won a London derby in the top flight up to this point, but Cannon, who had come through the youth ranks, marked the Chelsea striker [[Peter Osgood]] out of the game and then scored the second goal in a 2\u20130 win to begin a long career with the club.<ref>Matthews, pp.121\u2013122, 139\u2013140</ref>\n\n==The coming of The Eagles (1973\u201384)==\nDespite relegation, the 1973\u201374 season started with much optimism among the Palace supporters. Malcolm Allison had a strong recent record as a coach, having won trophies with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] as an assistant to [[Joe Mercer]]. Allison or 'Big Mal' as he was nicknamed in the press, had a flamboyant personality which was something of a change for the club, who previously had a rather conservative image. Palace's nickname was changed from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\" and the club also changed its colours from the original claret and sky blue to a red and dark blue scheme inspired by [[Barcelona FC|Barcelona]]. The Eagle was introduced as the club mascot at this time, an idea borrowed from [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], and the club badge was redesigned. The new season saw the introduction of a three-up, three-down [[promotion and relegation]] system, and Palace struggled to find their feet in the Second Division, failing to win any of their first 15 league games. In bottom place for most of the season, the club, aided by the signing from [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] of pacey winger [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] climbed to seventeenth place with a 3\u20131 win at Fulham on [[Good Friday]]. The club then turned in three consecutive losses which saw them needing to win the last game of the season at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] to remain in the second tier of English football. They could only draw 1\u20131, and suffered relegation for a second successive season.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.141-166\">Matthews, pp.141\u2013166</ref>\n\n[[File:Palace1970sbadge.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Malcolm Allison|Allison's]] rebranded Palace crest]]\n\nIn 1974\u201375, Palace's first season back in Division Three since 1963\u201364, saw the club miss out on promotion, finishing in fifth place. Allison acquired [[Terry Venables]] and [[Ian Evans (footballer)|Ian Evans]] from [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] in exchange for [[Don Rogers (footballer)|Don Rogers]], a trade that was to be significant to Palace's, and indeed England's football future. It was also around this time that Allison persuaded the club to put more resources into developing a strong youth team, a decision that would lead to both success at youth level, and the emergence of a number of promising young players in the first team. Palace again failed to gain promotion the following season, distracted in part by their best run in the FA Cup up to that point. The club reached the semi-finals, beating [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and Chelsea along the way, before losing 0\u20132 to Southampton at Stamford Bridge on 3 April 1976. Allison resigned at the end of the season, partly because of the failure to get Palace promoted, but also he had felt pressure due to some of his off the field antics, infamously getting himself photographed in the team bath with porn star [[Fiona Richmond]].<ref name=\"Matthews, p.141-166\"/><ref>\"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/sport-obituaries/8067232/Malcolm-Allison.html Malcolm Allison].\" The Daily Telegraph: 31. 16 October 2010.

The Palace youngsters also won the [[FA Youth Cup]] with a side including [[Kenny Sansom]], [[Vince Hilaire]] and [[Billy Gilbert (footballer born 1959)|Billy Gilbert]]. The following season, 1977\u201378, saw the youth team become the first to win the FA Youth Cup in successive seasons since Chelsea did in 1960 and 1961. These talented young players had become regulars in the first team by the 1978\u201379 season, which saw Palace vying not only for promotion, but also the Second Division title. The final game of the season was a Friday night match at home to Burnley. In front of the club's record home crowd of 51,482, there was all to play for: a Palace win, and the club would be champions; a draw, and Palace would be promoted, but hand the title to fierce rivals [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]]; a loss and Palace would stay down, with Sunderland clinching the final promotion place. At half-time the deadlock had not been broken despite Palace's dominance, but a second-half cross from Vince Hilaire allowed [[Ian Walsh (footballer)|Ian Walsh]] to head the opener, before a great run by [[David Swindlehurst]] was completed by a finish from outside the penalty area to give the Eagles a 2\u20130 win. Palace were crowned champions, and had reached the top flight again.\n\nAs an increasing number of players from the FA Youth Cup winning team had established themselves in the first team, the press gave Palace the title of the \"''Team of the Eighties''\". They began the 1979\u201380 season well and stayed unbeaten longer than any other club in the top flight and also went top of the table for the first and to date only time in the club's history when they beat [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] 4\u20131 at Selhurst Park in late September. Unfortunately the young starlets could not keep this form up, and a slide down the table resulted in the Eagles finishing thirteenth, which at that point was the club's highest ever league finish.<ref>Matthews, pp.223\u2013226</ref>\n\nThe slide continued into the 1980\u201381 season, with nine defeats in the first ten games, and Venables quit Palace to join QPR. The club were suffering financial problems as well, and were virtually relegated by the start of February when another, even bigger change occurred. [[Ron Noades]], previously the chairman of [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], took financial control of the club, purchasing it from Raymond Bloye's consortium. Palace spent the next couple of seasons flirting with relegation from the second tier and there were numerous managerial changes including the unpopular appointment of ex-Brighton manager [[Alan Mullery]].\n\n==Steve Coppell era  (1984\u201393)==\n[[File:Steve coppell 2006 promotion celebration cropped.JPG|thumb|right|Steve Coppell, who led Palace to the FA Cup Final and a third place finish in the top flight. Coppell has managed the club over four separate spells.]]\nThe former Manchester United and England winger [[Steve Coppell]] was appointed as Palace's new manager for the 1984\u201385 season. Coppell's playing career had been cut short by a knee injury, and, assisted by former Palace player Ian Evans, he worked on rebuilding the club, signing the then unknown [[Ian Wright]] from non-league [[Greenwich Borough F.C.|Greenwich Borough]] and [[Mark Bright]] from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], and the pair formed the \"''Wrighty & Brighty''\" strike partnership. Coppell stabilised the club in his first season, and after two seasons of narrowly missing out on the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]], they followed this up by only just missing out on automatic promotion by a single point. The club instead entered the [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1989 Second Division play-offs]], beating Swindon in the semi-finals to set up a two legged final against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. In the first leg at [[Ewood Park]] the [[Lancashire]] club won 3\u20131, but a 30,000 full house at Selhurst Park saw the Eagles triumph 3\u20130 after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the second leg to end their eight-year exile from the top flight. Ian Wright, who scored 24 league goals, and 33 in all competitions in the promotion campaign, was voted player of the year by the club's supporters.<ref>{{cite news|title=1988/89 revisited|date=26 July 2009|url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=4424|work=holmesdale.net|archivedate=3 June 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6f2D9LR?url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=4424|access-date=11 April 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Matthews, p.289-292, 311\">Matthews, p.&nbsp;289\u2013292, 311</ref><ref>Matthews, pp.226\u2013236, 267\u2013285</ref>\n\nPalace began their first top flight campaign in almost a decade by re-signing [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1964)|Andy Gray]] from QPR for \u00a3500,000. In November, the club hit the headlines when they signed [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] goalkeeper [[Nigel Martyn]] for \u00a31 million \u2013 a record fee for a goalkeeper in Britain. However, mixed form meant that the Eagles ended the season fifteenth after spending most of the first half in the top ten. But it was in the FA Cup that Palace really shone. After a succession of ties against lower division teams ([[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]]), Palace reached the semi-finals, drawing the same Liverpool team that had beaten them 9\u20130 in the league earlier in the season. The tie was played at [[Villa Park]], and saw Liverpool score first to lead 1\u20130 at half-time. Palace emerged from the interval with a sense of purpose, and within a minute of the restart equalised through Mark Bright. After going 2\u20131 up, Palace then found themselves 2\u20133 down late in the match and were seemingly beaten. However an equaliser by Andy Gray with just two minutes remaining took the tie into extra-time, with the winner scored by [[Alan Pardew]] in a thrilling 4\u20133 victory and for the first time in their history, Palace were in the [[1990 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]].<ref>Matthews, pp.289\u2013292, 311</ref>\n\nTheir first ever appearance at Wembley Stadium saw Palace facing [[Alex Ferguson|Alex Ferguson's]] Manchester United.

Palace were unfortunate to miss out on a place in Europe because although the ban on English clubs in European competitions following the [[Heysel disaster]] of 1985 had now been lifted, there would only be one place available in the [[UEFA Cup 1991-92|1991\u201392]] edition of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], and this went to Liverpool rather than Palace. Success was achieved that season however when Palace made their third trip to Wembley in twelve months, beating Everton 4\u20131 in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]] of the [[Full Members Cup]].\n\nThe following season was to become one marked by controversy. In September, [[Channel 4]] showed a documentary called ''Critical Eye \u2013 Great Britain United'', which featured interviews with a number of club personnel. Among them was chairman Ron Noades, who commented \"when you're getting into mid-winter in England, you need a few hard white men to carry the artistic black players through\". Noades claimed he was reported out of context, an allegation rejected by the programme makers,<ref>Duncan, John. \"Noades Still Under Fire.\" The Guardian: 16. 17 September 1991. ProQuest. Web. 30 May 2013.</ref> and his comments stunned Palace's many black players. Ian Wright left the club soon after, transferring to Arsenal for \u00a32.5 million and Palace finished tenth in the First Division at the end of the [[1991-92 in English football|1991\u201392 season]]. A breakaway by the top 22 clubs saw Palace become founder members of the new [[FA Premier League]] for the [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. Mark Bright was sold to Sheffield Wednesday in September and the Eagles struggled to score goals without him. They were relegated on goal difference, after Oldham Athletic's 4\u20133 victory over Southampton on the last day of the season. Palace's 49 points from 42 games that season became the joint-highest total of any club ever to have been relegated from the top flight of English football, and remains a Premier League record. The club's relegation prompted the resignation of Coppell after nine years at the helm, and he was succeeded by his assistant [[Alan Smith (football manager)|Alan Smith]].<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;314\u2013320</ref>\n\n==Ups and downs (1993\u201398)==\n<!-- [[File:Eric Cantona kung-fu kick.jpg|thumb|Ex-[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] player [[Eric Cantona]] kicks spectator Matthew Simmons]] -->\n\nAlan Smith immediately guided Palace back to the Premier League as runaway champions of the second tier,<ref>Alexander, Jeremy. \"Soccer: FIRST DIVISION: Palace Promoted a Day Late Luton Town 0, Crystal Palace 1.\" The Guardian (pre-1997 Fulltext): 0. 18 April 1994.

They were formed in 1905 at the site of the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace Exhibition building]], although an amateur [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] team did play here as early as 1861. The club played their home games at the Crystal Palace [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final stadium]] for the first ten years of their existence before they were forced to leave due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]], and eventually moved to their current home at [[Selhurst Park]] in 1924.\n\nShortly after their formation, the club applied to gain election to the [[Football League]] but missed out by one vote. They instead joined the [[Southern Football League]] Second Division and were champions in their first season. The club played in the Southern League First Division for the next fifteen years. The Football League was restructured in 1920 which saw the majority of the Southern League First Division forming a new [[Football League Third Division]] which Palace became founder members of. At the end of the season Palace were crowned champions and gained promotion to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. After four seasons they suffered relegation to what was then the [[Third Division South]] and remained here until the Football League was restructured which saw Palace become founder members of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] in 1958. Over the next eleven years, under the chairmanship of [[Arthur Wait]], the club progressed up to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]], then the top flight of English football. Palace also achieved distinction in 1962 when the great [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] team of that era played for the first time in London in a friendly match at Selhurst Park. In 1973, the manager at that time [[Bert Head]] was moved upstairs to take the position of general manager. [[Malcolm Allison]] was brought in as team manager, but Palace were relegated back to the Second Division, and then to the Third in consecutive seasons. Allison instigated a number of changes at the club, their original nickname was changed from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\" and they ended the 68-year association with claret and blue by introducing the red-and-blue vertical stripes now associated with the club. \n\nAt the end of the [[1975\u201376 Football League|1975\u201376]] season, Allison left the club, and [[Terry Venables]] became manager taking Palace back to the top flight with promotions in 1977 and 1979. The period between 1989\u201391, under chairman [[Ron Noades]] and manager [[Steve Coppell]], saw the club reach the [[1990 FA Cup Final]], and finish in third place in the top division in the [[1990\u201391 Football League|1990\u201391]] season, only missing out on European qualification due to the partial [[UEFA]] ban on English clubs at that time following the [[Heysel Stadium disaster]]. Palace became founder members of the [[Premier League]] in 1992, but were relegated the same season, despite achieving 49 points which is still a Premier League record for a relegated club. The club bounced between the top two divisions during the rest of the 1990s, and enjoyed runs to the semi-finals of both the [[Football League Cup|League]] and [[FA Cup|FA]] Cups in 1995, before suffering [[Administration (law)|administration]] under the chairmanship of [[Mark Goldberg]]. Under new owner [[Simon Jordan]] the club spent much of its time in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] over the next ten years with a brief spell in the Premier League during [[2004\u201305 in English football|2004\u201305]]. Another administration in 2010 saw the club emerge owned by a consortium consisting of several wealthy fans led by [[Steve Parish (businessman)|Steve Parish]]. Palace then achieved promotion back to the Premier League via the [[Football League play-offs]] in 2013, and have since maintained their place among the elite and also reached the [[2016 FA Cup Final]].\n\n==Origins and formation (1854\u20131905)==\n[[File:CrystalPalace1905.jpg|thumb|right|The 1905 FA Cup Final at the Crystal Palace Stadium]]\n\nBetween 1852 and 1854, the glass exhibition building known as [[The Crystal Palace]] was relocated from [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and rebuilt in an area of South London next to [[Sydenham Hill]]. This area was renamed [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]] \u2013 including the [[Crystal Palace Park|park]] surrounding the site, where various sports facilities were built. The earliest known [[Crystal Palace F.C. (1861)|Crystal Palace]] football team first played here in 1861 as an amateur outfit.<ref>The Origin of Crystal Palace FC, Volume I. Steve Martyniuk 2016.</ref> They went on to become founder members of [[the Football Association]] and competed in the first ever [[FA Cup]] competition in [[1871\u201372 FA Cup|1871\u201372]] reaching the [[FA Cup Semi-finals|semi-finals]] where they were eliminated by the [[Royal Engineers A.F.C.|Royal Engineers]] in a replay after the first game ended goalless. The team also played in the FA Cup in the next four seasons before disappearing from historical records after a 0\u20133 defeat to eventual winners [[Wanderers F.C.|Wanderers]] in the second round of the [[1875\u201376 FA Cup|1875\u201376]] FA Cup. In 1895, the Football Association adopted a new permanent home for the [[Crystal Palace National Sports Centre#Football|FA Cup Final]] which was to be played at the sports stadium situated inside the historic grounds of the Palace. With the owners also reliant on tourist activity for their income, they sought fresh attractions for the venue, and founded the [[London County Cricket Club]] of [[W. G. Grace]] before turning their attention to football.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;11\u201313</ref>\n\nThe idea of a new club playing at the Crystal Palace stadium was proposed in 1904 by the Crystal Palace Company. The proposal was rejected by the Football Association, who disliked the idea that the owners of the Cup Final venue would also possess their own football club. However a separate company was established the following year to form the club under the chairmanship of [[Sydney Bourne]], who was chosen due to his propensity in buying tickets to the Cup Final.<ref name=\"Matthews 13\">Matthews, p. 13</ref>\n\n==Southern League (1905\u201320)==\n{{see also|1905 in association football}}\n\n[[File:Crystal palace fc 1905-06.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Crystal Palace squad of 1905\u201306.]]\n\nCrystal Palace Football Club was founded on 10 September 1905,<ref name=CPOS>{{cite web|last=Byfield |first=Terry |title=History |url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ |publisher=Crystal Palace Football Club |accessdate=27 May 2013 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6e96TrN?url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/club/history/ |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> playing in the [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] colours of claret and blue.<ref name=RG1>{{cite book|last=Mitten|first=Andy|title=The Rough Guide to Cult Football|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781848365421|url-access=registration|year=2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|isbn=1-4053-8796-3}}</ref> The choice of colours was a result of the important role in the club's formation played by [[Edmund Goodman]], an Aston Villa employee who was recommended to the fledgling club by the Villa chairman, [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]].

However, that was the club's only defeat in the league all season, and Palace won the championship and was promoted to the Southern League First Division. The season included a run of seventeen straight victories, one of them being a 9\u20131 win over Grays United. The crowd attendances for the season were regularly between 2,000 and 3,000 although 4,000 attended the 4\u20130 defeat of [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] Reserves in March.<ref>Matthews, p.14</ref>\n\nFollowing their championship win, Palace started their second season as a club in the Southern League First Division, placing nineteenth at the end of the season but enjoying better form in the FA Cup. Beating [[Rotherham County F.C.|Rotherham County]] in a qualifying tie, Palace were then drawn away to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] in the First Round proper. Newcastle had played in the previous two FA Cup Finals, were league champions in 1905 and were on their way to another title. In what still stands as one of the club's greatest ever wins, Palace scored through [[Horace Astley]] against the run of play and then held off Newcastle to come away with a shock [[Newcastle United F.C. 0\u20131 Crystal Palace F.C. (1907)|1\u20130]] win. The second and third rounds saw Palace dispose of [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] respectively, the latter after a replay, and the quarter-finals saw Palace drawn at home to First Division club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], who were flying high in second place. In front of a record crowd of 35,000, Palace took the lead, but their opponents equalised taking the tie to a replay, where Everton proved too strong, running out 4\u20130 winners.<ref>Matthews, pp.15\u201316</ref>\n\n[[File:Ted Smith goal for Crystal Palace circa 1914.jpg|thumb|500px|right|A headed goal scored by [[Edwin Smith (footballer)|Edwin Smith]] from a [[Billy Davies (Welsh footballer)|Billy Davies]] cross against [[Reading F.C.]], c.&nbsp;1914]]\nJohn Robson left Palace to manage neighbours [[Croydon Common F.C.]] for the 1907\u201308 season, and Edmund Goodman took over as manager and club secretary. The club had a good season, finishing fourth. [[Billy Davies (Welsh footballer)|Bill Davies]] became the first player from the club to be capped at international level when he was called up for [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. The club could not sustain their league form the following season, finishing in a disappointing sixteenth place. In the FA Cup Palace lost 0\u20139 to [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] in a second round replay, which was a record defeat for the club. Palace managed to finish fourth again in the league the following season, losing just one game in the first twelve, and repeated their fourth-place finish the season after, with league attendances as high as 12,000. The club won the [[London Challenge Cup]] in 1913, overcoming [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] 1\u20130. After seventh and fifth-place finishes, Palace enjoyed good form in the 1913\u201314 season, with the club putting together some long unbeaten runs and finishing the season runners-up to [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] on goal average. They also retained the London Challenge Cup, defeating [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] 2\u20131 at [[Highbury Stadium|Highbury]], and provided their first [[England national football team|England]] representative in [[Horace Colclough]], who played in the team that beat Wales in Cardiff on 16 March.<ref>Matthews, pp.16\u201319</ref>\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the [[First World War]] on 4 August 1914, Palace had three players called up as [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Reservists]] before the season started. Former Palace players [[Ginger Williams (footballer)|Ginger Williams]] and [[Joe Bulcock]] were amongst those killed in the conflict. In March 1915, [[The Admiralty]], who had taken over the Palace and its grounds at the start of the war, ordered the club to leave and Palace chose to move to [[Herne Hill Velodrome]]. When Croydon Common F.C. failed to return to business after the war, Palace moved to their ground known as [[The Nest (stadium)|The Nest]] which was opposite [[Selhurst railway station]]. In the first full season after the war, Palace finished in third place in 1919\u201320.<ref>Matthews, pp.19, 23\u201326</ref>\n\n==The Football League (1920\u201358)==\nCrystal Palace became a Football League club in 1920 when the Southern League First Division clubs were admitted ''en bloc'' as founder members of a newly formed Football League [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]]. In their first season as a Football League club, Palace lost their opening game at [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] 1\u20132 with A.G. Milligan scoring the club's first ever Football League goal. Milligan's Palace career was short-lived however, and he made just one more appearance for the club. Palace's first ever home Football League match was a disappointing 0\u20130 draw against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], but the club then went on a run of six consecutive wins. Goalkeeper [[Jack Alderson]], who had been signed in 1919, kept a clean sheet in all of those wins and Palace lost just six more games all season. They were unbeaten in the final sixteen games of the season which included an eight-game winning streak and went on to win the championship by five points from Southampton. The feat earned them promotion to the Second Division. The club conceded just thirty four goals over the season, a record that stood until 1978\u201379,<ref>Matthews, p.26, 28</ref> and they joined [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]], [[Birmingham City F.C.|Small Heath]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] as the only clubs to have won a championship in their first season as a league club. Palace also won their third London Challenge Cup, beating [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]] 1\u20130 at [[White Hart Lane]] with a goal from forward [[John Conner (footballer)|John Conner]].<ref>Matthews, p.29</ref>\n\n[[File:Jack Alderson Caricature 1922.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Goalkeeper [[Jack Alderson]], caricatured in the ''Football Special'' in 1922.

This arrangement would continue until 1958 when the Third and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]<nowiki/> were formed, but for now Palace were above all of that, and in 1921 they opened their second season in the Football League as a Second Division club, finishing in fourteenth place. The highest attendance of the season was 20,000 for the match against Fulham. Palace remained in the lower reaches of the table during the following season, 1922\u201323, eventually finishing fifteenth. The club also made a significant purchase that season with regards to a new permanent home.<ref>Matthews, pp.29\u201330</ref>\n\nBack in 1919, the Palace minute book contained an entry instructing the Secretary to investigate the possibility of obtaining a lease on the 'ground at Selhurst', although calling it a 'ground' was a little misleading since at the time it was a piece of wasteland valuable only to the [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway|London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company]]. At one time it had been a brickfield, and two chimney stacks still remained. On 3 January 1922 the club purchased the ground at a cost of \u00a32,750, and renowned football ground architect [[Archibald Leitch]] was commissioned to design [[Selhurst Park]]. Leitch had designed stands at [[Craven Cottage]], [[Stamford Bridge (stadium)|Stamford Bridge]], White Hart Lane and [[Leeds Road, Huddersfield|Leeds Road]], but the design for Selhurst Park was unusual in that it had no roof gable. The other three sides of the ground remained open banking with just the lower parts being terraced. Construction work was delayed by industrial disputes, and when the ground was opened by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] on the 30 August 1924, the stand had not been completed. It did however boast many luxuries, including \"offices, tea rooms, training quarters, plunge, slipper shower and needle baths\". The opening fixture was against [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]], and in front of a crowd of 25,000, Palace lost 0\u20131, with the first goal at Selhurst Park being scored by Billy Marsden. That defeat set the tone for the season, with the club eventually finishing in twenty-first place \u2013 and were relegated along with [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]]. A win in the last game at home to [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] would have secured survival, but Palace went down 0\u20131 and it would be almost 40 years before Palace would again grace the second level of English football. One small consolation was the decision by the FA to stage the England versus Wales international at Selhurst Park on 1 March 1926. It remains the only full international match to be staged at the ground.<ref>Matthews, pp.30, 33\u201335</ref>\n\nAfter one season in the Third Division South and eighteen in total, Edmund Goodman stepped down as manager and returned to administrative duties, and a succession of managers attempted to plot Palace's climb back up the table. However, their stay in the division was to last as long as the Third Division South itself. With only the champions gaining promotion, it was a difficult division to get out of, although Palace came close on more than one occasion. In the fourteen Third Division South seasons pre-Second World War, Palace finished in the top seven ten times, and never lower than fourteenth and also finished runners-up no less than three times. At the start of the 1939\u201340 season, Palace were sitting second in the table, but the season was cancelled after just three matches with the onset of the [[Second World War]].<ref>Matthews, pp.35\u201336, 39\u201346</ref>\n\nThe war years of 1939\u201345 saw football enter a period of disarray with the creation of [[Wartime League]]s. Palace joined the South \"A\" Division in 1939, but also joined the South League \"D\" in 1940, winning the latter competition, and then promptly winning an improvised South Regional League the following season on goal average. Palace joined the London League for the 1941\u201342 season, with the clubs in London refusing to accept the ad-hoc competitions the Football League were organising. This division only lasted that season before the London clubs were back in the Football League fold, with Palace joining the Football League South for the next four seasons.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.57-61\">Matthews, p.&nbsp;57\u201361</ref> The club fielded 186 different players during the seven wartime seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10323~754182,00.html |title=Palace During WWII |accessdate=27 March 2009 |publisher=Crystal Palace |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214005340/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10323~754182%2C00.html |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nKit changes had been introduced in the late 1930s. The 1937\u201338 season saw Palace field a shirt of claret and blue stripes, before adopting white shirts and black shorts for the following eleven seasons. The club reverted to claret and blue in 1948\u201349, but any attempt at changing the kit to change their luck backfired as the club had their worst season to date, finishing bottom and applying for [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election]] for the first time. Palace kept their place, changed the kit back to white shirts and black shorts, and finished seventh the following season. They followed this up with another bottom place and re-election in 1950\u201351, with the unwanted record of scoring the lowest number of goals in a Division Three South season. Palace would remain in the bottom half of the table until the league was restructured in 1958\u201359, requiring re-election for a third and final time in 1955\u201356, with only Swindon keeping them from bottom spot that season.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.57-61\"/>\n\n==Rising through the divisions (1958\u201373)==\nThe 1958\u201359 season began a period of change, with [[Arthur Wait]] taking control of the club as chairman and the league was restructured with Palace playing in the new Fourth Division. This new division had been formed with the merging of the clubs in the bottom half of Third Division South with those in the bottom half of Third Division North. Palace had failed to qualify for the new Third Division, falling outside the top twelve finish required by two places. Their first season in the Fourth Division saw Palace finish seventh, with the club faring slightly worse the following season with an eighth place finish. Wait appointed the ex-Tottenham manager [[Arthur Rowe]] in April 1960 and the club then enjoyed a successful 1960\u201361 season, finishing second behind league newcomers [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]], who thus matched Palace's 1920\u201321 achievement of winning a championship in their inaugural league season. Palace also set Fourth Division records for the highest average attendance of 19,092, and the highest attendance at an individual match; 37,774 for the Good Friday game at Selhurst Park against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm |title=Division Four 1960/61 |archivedate=3 June 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6eJurvH?url=http://www.footballsite.co.uk/Statistics/LeagueTables/Season1960-61/Div41960-61.htm |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Surrey-born [[Johnny Byrne (footballer)|Johnny Byrne]] scored 31 of Palace's 110 goals, and his strike partner [[Roy Summersby]] netted 25 as Palace moved up to Division Three.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;79\u201380, 87\u201390</ref>\n\nPalace finished fifteenth in Division Three at the end of the 1961\u201362 season. In November, Johnny Byrne was called up to the England team, despite playing outside the top two divisions at the time, one of only five players ever to achieve this. He played the whole of the 1\u20131 draw against [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]], part of the [[1961\u201362 British Home Championship|1962 British Home Championship]], at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. After international recognition, the West Ham manager [[Ron Greenwood]] paid a British record transfer fee of \u00a365,000 and ex-Palace striker [[Ron Brett]] in exchange to take \"Budgie\" to the Hammers in March 1962. This was a record fee between two British clubs at the time.

Johnny Byrne returned to the Palace line-up as a guest player. Madrid ended up 4\u20133 winners. Arthur Rowe resigned due to health reasons in December 1962 and the club appointed former player [[Dick Graham]] as manager. The 1962\u201363 season saw Palace finish eleventh, before gaining promotion to the Second Division the following season after finishing second behind Coventry City on goal average.<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;93\u201395</ref> \n\nFor the following four seasons Palace achieved respectable top half finishes in the Second Division, during which they appointed [[Bert Head]] as their new manager in April 1966. Head promoted from the youth team and transferred in players both new and old, delighting the fans by re-signing old favourite Johnny Byrne. His work paid dividends in the 1968\u201369 season when Palace, not fancied as promotion candidates at the beginning of the season, finished second behind [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] who were managed by [[Brian Clough]]. Palace had achieved a place in the top flight for the first time in their history, clinching promotion with a 16-game unbeaten run to end the season.<ref>Matthews, pp.95\u201396, 103\u2013106</ref>\n\n[[The Dave Clark Five|The Dave Clark Five's]] chart-hit \"[[Glad All Over]]\" became a huge crowd favourite at this time with the Palace fans banging on advertising hoardings in time with the drum beat in the chorus of the song.<ref>Sedgwick, Fred. \"[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/may/26/familyandrelationships.family9 Family: Playlist: The Football Anthems of My Youth].\" The Guardian: 7. 26 May 2007.

Scoring the first Division One goal for the club was [[Mel Blyth]] after six minutes, and a second goal from new signing [[Gerry Queen]] saw Palace hold United to a 2\u20132 draw with goalkeeper [[John Jackson (footballer born 1942)|John Jackson]] denying [[George Best]] and [[Brian Kidd]]. The next match was another home game versus [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] which Palace won 2\u20130. After a season long struggle against relegation, Palace were eventually able to secure safety, finishing in twentieth place above demoted Sheffield Wednesday and Sunderland. The club managed to gain three new records for the First Division at the end of this season: the fewest goals scored; the fewest wins recorded by a non-relegated team; and the tally of twenty-seven points was the smallest number with which a team has avoided relegation from the top flight.<ref>Matthews, 113\u2013115</ref> Palace avoided the drop for two more seasons,<ref>Matthews, 115\u2013121</ref> and followed the trend of many other top flight clubs by introducing a new \"''Player of the Year''\" award which has been presented at the end of every season since the 1971\u201372 campaign. The first recipient was [[John McCormick (footballer, born 1936)|John McCormick]].<ref name=\"POTY\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0,,10323~559565,00.html |title=Player Of The Year |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907141243/http://www.cpfc.co.uk/page/History/0%2C%2C10323~559565%2C00.html |archivedate=7 September 2011 |publisher=cpfc.co.uk (Crystal Palace F.C.) |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDespite some good performances in the 1972\u201373 season, notably a 5\u20130 home win against Manchester United in December, Palace eventually succumbed to the drop in their fourth season in the top flight. Arthur Wait, having overseen the rise of the club from the Fourth to the First Division, was replaced as chairman by Raymond Bloye in November 1972, and the club also appointed [[Malcolm Allison]] as the new manager in March the following year, replacing Bert Head. Although the club saw a record average attendance over the season, neither the crowd nor the managerial change were able to keep them at the top level. Allison's first game in charge at home against Chelsea did see some changes, however, including the debut of young Scottish defender [[Jim Cannon]]. Palace had never won a London derby in the top flight up to this point, but Cannon, who had come through the youth ranks, marked the Chelsea striker [[Peter Osgood]] out of the game and then scored the second goal in a 2\u20130 win to begin a long career with the club.<ref>Matthews, pp.121\u2013122, 139\u2013140</ref>\n\n==The coming of The Eagles (1973\u201384)==\nDespite relegation, the 1973\u201374 season started with much optimism among the Palace supporters. Malcolm Allison had a strong recent record as a coach, having won trophies with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] as an assistant to [[Joe Mercer]]. Allison or 'Big Mal' as he was nicknamed in the press, had a flamboyant personality which was something of a change for the club, who previously had a rather conservative image. Palace's nickname was changed from \"The Glaziers\" to \"The Eagles\" and the club also changed its colours from the original claret and sky blue to a red and dark blue scheme inspired by [[Barcelona FC|Barcelona]]. The Eagle was introduced as the club mascot at this time, an idea borrowed from [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]], and the club badge was redesigned. The new season saw the introduction of a three-up, three-down [[promotion and relegation]] system, and Palace struggled to find their feet in the Second Division, failing to win any of their first 15 league games. In bottom place for most of the season, the club, aided by the signing from [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] of pacey winger [[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] climbed to seventeenth place with a 3\u20131 win at Fulham on [[Good Friday]]. The club then turned in three consecutive losses which saw them needing to win the last game of the season at [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] to remain in the second tier of English football. They could only draw 1\u20131, and suffered relegation for a second successive season.<ref name=\"Matthews, p.141-166\">Matthews, pp.141\u2013166</ref>\n\n[[File:Palace1970sbadge.jpg|thumb|70px|[[Malcolm Allison|Allison's]] rebranded Palace crest]]\n\nIn 1974\u201375, Palace's first season back in Division Three since 1963\u201364, saw the club miss out on promotion, finishing in fifth place. Allison acquired [[Terry Venables]] and [[Ian Evans (footballer)|Ian Evans]] from [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|QPR]] in exchange for [[Don Rogers (footballer)|Don Rogers]], a trade that was to be significant to Palace's, and indeed England's football future. It was also around this time that Allison persuaded the club to put more resources into developing a strong youth team, a decision that would lead to both success at youth level, and the emergence of a number of promising young players in the first team. Palace again failed to gain promotion the following season, distracted in part by their best run in the FA Cup up to that point. The club reached the semi-finals, beating [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds United]] and Chelsea along the way, before losing 0\u20132 to Southampton at Stamford Bridge on 3 April 1976. Allison resigned at the end of the season, partly because of the failure to get Palace promoted, but also he had felt pressure due to some of his off the field antics, infamously getting himself photographed in the team bath with porn star [[Fiona Richmond]].<ref name=\"Matthews, p.141-166\"/><ref>\"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/sport-obituaries/8067232/Malcolm-Allison.html Malcolm Allison].\" The Daily Telegraph: 31. 16 October 2010.

The Palace youngsters also won the [[FA Youth Cup]] with a side including [[Kenny Sansom]], [[Vince Hilaire]] and [[Billy Gilbert (footballer born 1959)|Billy Gilbert]]. The following season, 1977\u201378, saw the youth team become the first to win the FA Youth Cup in successive seasons since Chelsea did in 1960 and 1961. These talented young players had become regulars in the first team by the 1978\u201379 season, which saw Palace vying not only for promotion, but also the Second Division title. The final game of the season was a Friday night match at home to Burnley. In front of the club's record home crowd of 51,482, there was all to play for: a Palace win, and the club would be champions; a draw, and Palace would be promoted, but hand the title to fierce rivals [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]]; a loss and Palace would stay down, with Sunderland clinching the final promotion place. At half-time the deadlock had not been broken despite Palace's dominance, but a second-half cross from Vince Hilaire allowed [[Ian Walsh (footballer)|Ian Walsh]] to head the opener, before a great run by [[David Swindlehurst]] was completed by a finish from outside the penalty area to give the Eagles a 2\u20130 win. Palace were crowned champions, and had reached the top flight again.\n\nAs an increasing number of players from the FA Youth Cup winning team had established themselves in the first team, the press gave Palace the title of the \"''Team of the Eighties''\". They began the 1979\u201380 season well and stayed unbeaten longer than any other club in the top flight and also went top of the table for the first and to date only time in the club's history when they beat [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] 4\u20131 at Selhurst Park in late September. Unfortunately the young starlets could not keep this form up, and a slide down the table resulted in the Eagles finishing thirteenth, which at that point was the club's highest ever league finish.<ref>Matthews, pp.223\u2013226</ref>\n\nThe slide continued into the 1980\u201381 season, with nine defeats in the first ten games, and Venables quit Palace to join QPR. The club were suffering financial problems as well, and were virtually relegated by the start of February when another, even bigger change occurred. [[Ron Noades]], previously the chairman of [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]], took financial control of the club, purchasing it from Raymond Bloye's consortium. Palace spent the next couple of seasons flirting with relegation from the second tier and there were numerous managerial changes including the unpopular appointment of ex-Brighton manager [[Alan Mullery]].\n\n==Steve Coppell era  (1984\u201393)==\n[[File:Steve coppell 2006 promotion celebration cropped.JPG|thumb|right|Steve Coppell, who led Palace to the FA Cup Final and a third place finish in the top flight. Coppell has managed the club over four separate spells.]]\nThe former Manchester United and England winger [[Steve Coppell]] was appointed as Palace's new manager for the 1984\u201385 season. Coppell's playing career had been cut short by a knee injury, and, assisted by former Palace player Ian Evans, he worked on rebuilding the club, signing the then unknown [[Ian Wright]] from non-league [[Greenwich Borough F.C.|Greenwich Borough]] and [[Mark Bright]] from [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], and the pair formed the \"''Wrighty & Brighty''\" strike partnership. Coppell stabilised the club in his first season, and after two seasons of narrowly missing out on the [[English Football League play-offs|play-offs]], they followed this up by only just missing out on automatic promotion by a single point. The club instead entered the [[1989 Football League play-offs#Second Division|1989 Second Division play-offs]], beating Swindon in the semi-finals to set up a two legged final against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. In the first leg at [[Ewood Park]] the [[Lancashire]] club won 3\u20131, but a 30,000 full house at Selhurst Park saw the Eagles triumph 3\u20130 after [[Extra time (football)|extra-time]] in the second leg to end their eight-year exile from the top flight. Ian Wright, who scored 24 league goals, and 33 in all competitions in the promotion campaign, was voted player of the year by the club's supporters.<ref>{{cite news|title=1988/89 revisited|date=26 July 2009|url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=4424|work=holmesdale.net|archivedate=3 June 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6H6f2D9LR?url=http://www.holmesdale.net/page.php?id=82&story=4424|access-date=11 April 2010|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Matthews, p.289-292, 311\">Matthews, p.&nbsp;289\u2013292, 311</ref><ref>Matthews, pp.226\u2013236, 267\u2013285</ref>\n\nPalace began their first top flight campaign in almost a decade by re-signing [[Andy Gray (footballer born 1964)|Andy Gray]] from QPR for \u00a3500,000. In November, the club hit the headlines when they signed [[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]] goalkeeper [[Nigel Martyn]] for \u00a31 million \u2013 a record fee for a goalkeeper in Britain. However, mixed form meant that the Eagles ended the season fifteenth after spending most of the first half in the top ten. But it was in the FA Cup that Palace really shone. After a succession of ties against lower division teams ([[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]], [[Rochdale A.F.C.|Rochdale]] and [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]]), Palace reached the semi-finals, drawing the same Liverpool team that had beaten them 9\u20130 in the league earlier in the season. The tie was played at [[Villa Park]], and saw Liverpool score first to lead 1\u20130 at half-time. Palace emerged from the interval with a sense of purpose, and within a minute of the restart equalised through Mark Bright. After going 2\u20131 up, Palace then found themselves 2\u20133 down late in the match and were seemingly beaten. However an equaliser by Andy Gray with just two minutes remaining took the tie into extra-time, with the winner scored by [[Alan Pardew]] in a thrilling 4\u20133 victory and for the first time in their history, Palace were in the [[1990 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]].<ref>Matthews, pp.289\u2013292, 311</ref>\n\nTheir first ever appearance at Wembley Stadium saw Palace facing [[Alex Ferguson|Alex Ferguson's]] Manchester United. [[Gary O'Reilly]] opened the scoring for Palace, but [[Bryan Robson]] and [[Mark Hughes]] put United 2\u20131 up. Ian Wright then equalised immediately after coming onto the pitch as a substitute to take the final into extra-time, before scoring again early in the added period to put Palace back in the lead. Hughes scored his second late on for United to leave the game drawn 3\u20133 and requiring a replay.

Palace were unfortunate to miss out on a place in Europe because although the ban on English clubs in European competitions following the [[Heysel disaster]] of 1985 had now been lifted, there would only be one place available in the [[UEFA Cup 1991-92|1991\u201392]] edition of the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]], and this went to Liverpool rather than Palace. Success was achieved that season however when Palace made their third trip to Wembley in twelve months, beating Everton 4\u20131 in the [[1991 Full Members Cup Final|final]] of the [[Full Members Cup]].\n\nThe following season was to become one marked by controversy. In September, [[Channel 4]] showed a documentary called ''Critical Eye \u2013 Great Britain United'', which featured interviews with a number of club personnel. Among them was chairman Ron Noades, who commented \"when you're getting into mid-winter in England, you need a few hard white men to carry the artistic black players through\". Noades claimed he was reported out of context, an allegation rejected by the programme makers,<ref>Duncan, John. \"Noades Still Under Fire.\" The Guardian: 16. 17 September 1991. ProQuest. Web. 30 May 2013.</ref> and his comments stunned Palace's many black players. Ian Wright left the club soon after, transferring to Arsenal for \u00a32.5 million and Palace finished tenth in the First Division at the end of the [[1991-92 in English football|1991\u201392 season]]. A breakaway by the top 22 clubs saw Palace become founder members of the new [[FA Premier League]] for the [[1992-93 in English football|1992\u201393 season]]. Mark Bright was sold to Sheffield Wednesday in September and the Eagles struggled to score goals without him. They were relegated on goal difference, after Oldham Athletic's 4\u20133 victory over Southampton on the last day of the season. Palace's 49 points from 42 games that season became the joint-highest total of any club ever to have been relegated from the top flight of English football, and remains a Premier League record. The club's relegation prompted the resignation of Coppell after nine years at the helm, and he was succeeded by his assistant [[Alan Smith (football manager)|Alan Smith]].<ref>Matthews, p.&nbsp;314\u2013320</ref>\n\n==Ups and downs (1993\u201398)==\n<!-- [[File:Eric Cantona kung-fu kick.jpg|thumb|Ex-[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] player [[Eric Cantona]] kicks spectator Matthew Simmons]] -->\n\nAlan Smith immediately guided Palace back to the Premier League as runaway champions of the second tier,<ref>Alexander, Jeremy. \"Soccer: FIRST DIVISION: Palace Promoted a Day Late Luton Town 0, Crystal Palace 1.\" The Guardian (pre-1997 Fulltext): 0. 18 April 1994.

This marks Porsche's first fully digital instrument binnacle. A 10.9&nbsp;inch screen is situated to the right of the instrument binnacle which serves as the infotainment system of the car. An optional screen is placed to the right of the infotainment screen which allows the front passenger to customise the infotainment system. An 8.4&nbsp;inch screen is present in a portrait layout on the centre console with a trackpad to control the functions. The screen displays the status of the powertrain and tells the driver to efficiently use the power. Despite using an all digital layout, the dashboard features the classic Porsche clock on the top. \n\nThe exterior styling, penned by former Porsche Exterior Designer Mitja Borkert, is strongly influenced by the Mission E concept and retains most of the design elements present on the concept except the suicide doors and B pillars. Design features include a retractable rear spoiler, retractable door handles and an advanced regenerative braking system. Taking full advantage of the packaging advantages inherent in its drivetrain layout, the Taycan combines the fundamental short-nosed proportions of traditional Porsche models at the front with the stretched proportions of modern front-engine models towards the rear, providing clear design links to existing models. The front features four-point LED daytime running headlamps. At the rear, the car has a short notchback-style boot lid housing a full-width light band serving as taillights and turn signals that provides access to one of two luggage compartments. The other is under the bonnet and claimed to have a capacity of nearly 100 litres. The launch Turbo and Turbo S models come in a carbon fibre trim and 20-inch wheels as standard.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nFile:Porsche Taycan at IAA 2019 IMG 0737.jpg|Rear view\nFile:Porsche Experience (48776297423).jpg|Interior\n</gallery>\n\n== Specifications ==\n[[File:Porsche Taycan at IAA 2019 IMG 0184.jpg|thumb|The Taycan's J1 platform]]\nThe body of the Taycan consists mainly of steel and aluminium joined together by different bonding techniques. The [[B pillar]]s of the body, side roof frame and seat cross member are made from hot-formed steel while the bulkhead cross member is made from boron steel to improve safety. The shock absorber mounts, axle mounts and rear side members are made from forged aluminum, while all body panels except the front and rear bumpers are also made from aluminum to reduce weight. In total, 37% of the car is constructed of aluminium.<ref>{{cite web |title=The body: Intelligent mix of materials for maximum strength|url=https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/products/taycan/body-18553.html |website=Porsche Newsroom |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Taycan uses a new battery-electric drivetrain consisting of a permanent-magnet synchronous motor on each axle, allowing the car to have an all-wheel drive layout. At the front, power is sent to the wheels through a single-speed gearbox (8.05:1 [[gear ratio]]). At the rear, power is sent to the rear wheels through a two-speed transmission and a [[limited slip differential]]. The gearbox has a short planetary first gear (8.05:1) providing maximum acceleration performance and a long-ratio second gear (16:1) delivering top speed and efficiency.<ref name=jalop2019-09-06/> Power comes from a 93&nbsp;kWh {{cvt|1389|lbs|kg|order=flip}} lithium-ion battery pack that doubles as a structural chassis component and keeps the center of gravity low.<ref name=jalop2019-09-06/> In order to address space issues for passenger sitting on the rear seats, recesses called \"foot garages\" have been incorporated in the battery pack to improve legroom. The 723 volt pack (835 volt full, 610 volt empty) has 33 modules with 12 [[LG Chem]] [[Lithium-ion_battery#Shapes|pouch cell]]s each, for 396 cells in total.<ref name=jalop2019-09-06/><ref>{{cite web |title=The battery: Sophisticated thermal management, 800-volt system voltage |url=https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/products/taycan/battery-18557.html |website=Porsche Newsroom |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe driving range depends upon how the car is driven and what driving mode is selected. A \"range\" driving setting puts the car in a power save mode with the lowest power consumption while an \"Overdrive\" mode utilises maximum power while decoupling the front axle. The car has a total of five modes namely Sport, Sport Plus, Normal, Overdrive, Range along with an Individual mode in which the driver can customise various settings of the car.<ref name=\"cnn\"/> [[Regenerative braking]] provides up to 265 kW,<ref name=\"dow2\">{{cite web |last1=Dow |first1=Jameson |title=See what's underneath and inside the Porsche Taycan |url=https://ww.electrek.co/2019/12/26/see-whats-underneath-and-inside-the-porsche-taycan/ |website=[[Electrek]] |date=26 December 2019}}</ref> yielding a deceleration of 0.39 G.<ref name=jalop2019-09-06/>\n\nPorsche has developed an 800-volt charging system specifically for the Taycan. According to manufacturer estimates, the battery pack can be charged from a 5% state of charge to 80% in 22.5 minutes in ideal situations, with a DC fast charger offering 270 kW of power. Charge times are dependent on weather conditions and infrastructure. When purchasing a Taycan, owners receive three years free access to the speed charging infrastructure of Porsche's joint venture partner, [[IONITY]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.porsche.com/international/aboutporsche/e-performance/charging-on-the-road/ |title=Porsche Charging options for on the road. - Porsche AG|website=Porsche AG - Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG|language=en-EN|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nTo reduce charge times in both hot and cold temperatures, the battery can be thermally preconditioned using a charging planner. Owners simply need to set a departure time in the planner and the car will automatically warm or cool the battery for optimal charging times. A charging dock and mobile charger supplied with the car for home charging connect with a 9.6-kW connector that charges the car in 11 hours. Porsche has also developed an energy manager that can be installed in the house's circuit breaker. It is capable of managing a house's power flow, providing cost optimising charging, using solar power and providing blackout protection by reducing the charge to the car if other household appliances, such as fridges or dryers, turn on and exceed the breaker's max power threshold.<ref name=\"cnet\"/>\n\nThe Taycan Turbo has a drag coefficient of {{cd|0.22}}, which the manufacturer claims is the lowest of any current Porsche model. The Turbo S model has a slightly higher drag coefficient of {{cd|0.25}}.<ref name=\"acar\">{{cite web| url=https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/new-cars/porsche-taycan-specs-sale-date-performance |website=autocar.co.uk |title=Electric Porsche Taycan will be crucial to UK range, says boss |publisher= |accessdate= 21 March 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"cnet\">{{cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2020-porsche-taycan-official-debut-price/|title=2020 Porsche Taycan arrives with up to 750 hp, $150,900 base price|date=4 September 2019|first=Jon|last=Wong|publisher=Road Show|accessdate=5 September 2019}}</ref> The [[Automobile drag coefficient|frontal area]] is 2.33&nbsp;m\u00b2, with a resulting [[Automobile_drag_coefficient#Drag_area|drag area]] of 0.513&nbsp;m\u00b2 and 0.583&nbsp;m\u00b2 for the Turbo and Turbo S, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/2019/products/porsche-taycan-world-premiere-live-all-electric-sports-car-18445.html |website=newsroom.porsche.com |publisher=[[Porsche]] |title=World premiere of the Porsche Taycan |accessdate=10 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://newsroom.porsche.com/download/?id=620c272a-70eb-4031-a63f-b771f1b58fb5&lang=en |website=newsroom.porsche.com |publisher=[[Porsche]] |title=Taycan Turbo Technical Data |format=PDF  |page=4 |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://newsroom.porsche.com/download/?id=9ca8d085-14c8-4016-a865-ad0d8d29edc1&lang=en |website=newsroom.porsche.com |publisher=[[Porsche]] |title=Taycan Turbo S Technical Data |format=PDF |page=4 |accessdate=11 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\nThe Taycan is initially being offered as a saloon model but an estate model called the Taycan Cross Turismo is due to be launched.

This marks Porsche's first fully digital instrument binnacle. A 10.9&nbsp;inch screen is situated to the right of the instrument binnacle which serves as the infotainment system of the car. An optional screen is placed to the right of the infotainment screen which allows the front passenger to customise the infotainment system. An 8.4&nbsp;inch screen is present in a portrait layout on the centre console with a trackpad to control the functions. The screen displays the status of the powertrain and tells the driver to efficiently use the power. Despite using an all digital layout, the dashboard features the classic Porsche clock on the top. \n\nThe exterior styling, penned by former Porsche Exterior Designer Mitja Borkert, is strongly influenced by the Mission E concept and retains most of the design elements present on the concept except the suicide doors and B pillars. Design features include a retractable rear spoiler, retractable door handles and an advanced regenerative braking system. Taking full advantage of the packaging advantages inherent in its drivetrain layout, the Taycan combines the fundamental short-nosed proportions of traditional Porsche models at the front with the stretched proportions of modern front-engine models towards the rear, providing clear design links to existing models. The front features four-point LED daytime running headlamps. At the rear, the car has a short notchback-style boot lid housing a full-width light band serving as taillights and turn signals that provides access to one of two luggage compartments. The other is under the bonnet and claimed to have a capacity of nearly 100 litres. The launch Turbo and Turbo S models come in a carbon fibre trim and 20-inch wheels as standard.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\">\nFile:Porsche Taycan at IAA 2019 IMG 0737.jpg|Rear view\nFile:Porsche Experience (48776297423).jpg|Interior\n</gallery>\n\n== Specifications ==\n[[File:Porsche Taycan at IAA 2019 IMG 0184.jpg|thumb|The Taycan's J1 platform]]\nThe body of the Taycan consists mainly of steel and aluminium joined together by different bonding techniques. The [[B pillar]]s of the body, side roof frame and seat cross member are made from hot-formed steel while the bulkhead cross member is made from boron steel to improve safety. The shock absorber mounts, axle mounts and rear side members are made from forged aluminum, while all body panels except the front and rear bumpers are also made from aluminum to reduce weight. In total, 37% of the car is constructed of aluminium.<ref>{{cite web |title=The body: Intelligent mix of materials for maximum strength|url=https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/products/taycan/body-18553.html |website=Porsche Newsroom |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Taycan uses a new battery-electric drivetrain consisting of a permanent-magnet synchronous motor on each axle, allowing the car to have an all-wheel drive layout. At the front, power is sent to the wheels through a single-speed gearbox (8.05:1 [[gear ratio]]). At the rear, power is sent to the rear wheels through a two-speed transmission and a [[limited slip differential]]. The gearbox has a short planetary first gear (8.05:1) providing maximum acceleration performance and a long-ratio second gear (16:1) delivering top speed and efficiency.<ref name=jalop2019-09-06/> Power comes from a 93&nbsp;kWh {{cvt|1389|lbs|kg|order=flip}} lithium-ion battery pack that doubles as a structural chassis component and keeps the center of gravity low.<ref name=jalop2019-09-06/> In order to address space issues for passenger sitting on the rear seats, recesses called \"foot garages\" have been incorporated in the battery pack to improve legroom. The 723 volt pack (835 volt full, 610 volt empty) has 33 modules with 12 [[LG Chem]] [[Lithium-ion_battery#Shapes|pouch cell]]s each, for 396 cells in total.<ref name=jalop2019-09-06/><ref>{{cite web |title=The battery: Sophisticated thermal management, 800-volt system voltage |url=https://newsroom.porsche.com/en/products/taycan/battery-18557.html |website=Porsche Newsroom |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe driving range depends upon how the car is driven and what driving mode is selected. A \"range\" driving setting puts the car in a power save mode with the lowest power consumption while an \"Overdrive\" mode utilises maximum power while decoupling the front axle. The car has a total of five modes namely Sport, Sport Plus, Normal, Overdrive, Range along with an Individual mode in which the driver can customise various settings of the car.<ref name=\"cnn\"/> [[Regenerative braking]] provides up to 265 kW,<ref name=\"dow2\">{{cite web |last1=Dow |first1=Jameson |title=See what's underneath and inside the Porsche Taycan |url=https://ww.electrek.co/2019/12/26/see-whats-underneath-and-inside-the-porsche-taycan/ |website=[[Electrek]] |date=26 December 2019}}</ref> yielding a deceleration of 0.39 G.<ref name=jalop2019-09-06/>\n\nPorsche has developed an 800-volt charging system specifically for the Taycan. According to manufacturer estimates, the battery pack can be charged from a 5% state of charge to 80% in 22.5 minutes in ideal situations, with a DC fast charger offering 270 kW of power. Charge times are dependent on weather conditions and infrastructure. When purchasing a Taycan, owners receive three years free access to the speed charging infrastructure of Porsche's joint venture partner, [[IONITY]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.porsche.com/international/aboutporsche/e-performance/charging-on-the-road/ |title=Porsche Charging options for on the road. - Porsche AG|website=Porsche AG - Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche AG|language=en-EN|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nTo reduce charge times in both hot and cold temperatures, the battery can be thermally preconditioned using a charging planner. Owners simply need to set a departure time in the planner and the car will automatically warm or cool the battery for optimal charging times. A charging dock and mobile charger supplied with the car for home charging connect with a 9.6-kW connector that charges the car in 11 hours. Porsche has also developed an energy manager that can be installed in the house's circuit breaker. It is capable of managing a house's power flow, providing cost optimising charging, using solar power and providing blackout protection by reducing the charge to the car if other household appliances, such as fridges or dryers, turn on and exceed the breaker's max power threshold.<ref name=\"cnet\"/>\n\nThe Taycan Turbo has a drag coefficient of {{cd|0.22}}, which the manufacturer claims is the lowest of any current Porsche model.

He is the son of former NBA player [[Corey Crowder]].\n\nNot being heavily recruited out of high school, Crowder committed to [[South Georgia Technical College]] and later [[Howard College]], where he led the team to an [[NJCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]] in his sophomore season. While at Howard College, Crowder was also named [[NABC Player of the Year#State Farm Junior College Player of the Year|State Farm Junior College Player of the Year]]. Later, he transferred to [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]], where he was named [[Big East Player of the Year]] in his senior season. After his senior year ended, he became eligible for the [[2012 NBA draft]], where he was drafted 34th overall by the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and traded to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] on draft night. In 2014, Crowder was traded to the [[Boston Celtics]]. He spent three years in Boston before being traded back to his draft team, the Cavaliers, in August 2017. In  2018, he was traded to the [[Utah Jazz]] and he has also played for the [[Memphis Grizzlies]].\n\n==Early life and high school career==\nJae Crowder was born on July 6, 1990, in Villa Rica, Georgia, to Helen Thompson and basketball player Corey Crowder. Crowder attended [[Villa Rica High School]], where he played as starting [[quarterback]] for the [[American football|football]] team and as starting [[point guard]] for the basketball team. Crowder spent the summer holidays in Florida, working out and training with his father, then a professional basketball player, with 2 years experience in the NBA playing in Europe. Growing up, he was undersized and overweight, weighing nearly 200 pounds in his junior year. Eventually, he called his father, to help him lose weight. By the end of his junior year, he had grown to 6'4\" and had significantly improved his physical conditioning.<ref name=\"Out of the Shadows ... of thy Father: Jae's hardcourt journey of dreams\">{{Cite news |title = Out of the Shadows ... of thy Father: Jae's hardcourt journey of dreams |url = http://www.times-georgian.com/view/full_story/8814203/article-Out-of-the-Shadows---of-thy-Father--Jae-s-hardcourt-journey-of-dreams?instance=TG_sports_news |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120313135546/http://www.times-georgian.com/view/full_story/8814203/article-Out-of-the-Shadows---of-thy-Father--Jae-s-hardcourt-journey-of-dreams?instance=TG_sports_news |url-status = dead |archive-date = 2012-03-13 |newspaper = Times Georgian |accessdate = 2012-11-27 }}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nCrowder was not heavily recruited out of high school, although he had some offers in football.
