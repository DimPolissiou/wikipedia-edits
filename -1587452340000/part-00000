A sequel, ''[[Two Worlds II]]'', was released in Europe in 2010 and in North America in 2011.\n\n==Gameplay==\nThe game takes place in a real-time three-dimensional fantasy landscape. As such it has drawn comparison with ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]''.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/twoworlds/review.html?sid=6178016 Two Worlds for PC Review - PC Two Worlds Review<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Much like in ''Oblivion'' and ''[[Gothic 3]]'', the gameplay is non-linear. The player is free to explore the game world, accepting side quests at will. There is however, a core quest, centering on rescuing the protagonist's sister, who is being held for ransom by mysterious forces who are scheming to open the tomb of Aziraal, the [[deity|god]] of [[fire]].\n\nThe game does not utilize fixed character classes like other role-playing games. As the character gains experience and levels, it is possible to invest gained Attribute Points into any attribute, leading to a variety of game play styles and approaches. [[Death]] in the game leads to [[resurrection]] at a nearby shrine; these shrines are distributed across the game world, and also replenish health when the player comes in sufficient proximity. However, the highest difficulty of the game features a permanent death feature.\n\nThe world in which the game takes place is called Antaloor. While traveling through the game the player will encounter new teleports, caves, villages, and other locations, and these travels are recorded by the in-game mini-map. Teleports allow rapid travel between explored regions. Horses are available for the player to ride as well as other animals/creatures. There are various creatures in ''Two Worlds''. Unlike other CRPGs with wilderness areas, enemies will not respawn. Most of the non-wilderness areas are densely populated.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/783/783189p1.html | title=IGN: Two Worlds Preview | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=2007-04-24}}</ref>\n\nBeyond the main quest there is no set storyline to follow, the player is free to choose to complete the quests of their liking, and explore at will. The player may choose to act as a righteous hero and be honored amongst the population, or to be delightfully devilish and feared, through reputation gained by completing certain quests. However, the path chosen will have consequences on the outcome of the game.\n\n''Two Worlds'' has an [[alchemy]] system that allows the player to combine ingredients to make [[potion]]s, weapon enhancements, traps, and bombs. Spending Skill Points on the Alchemy Skill or using more ingredients will result in more powerful potions. Ingredients can be found as plants in the wild, the body parts of animals and monsters that have been slain, and minerals and gems taken as loot or collected off the ground. Some potions can have permanent effects such as a boost to strength, health, dexterity, magic etc.\n\nShould a player decide that they are unhappy with their ability and skill point distribution, there are NPCs called \"skill changers\" in some of the larger cities that offer a \"regression\", which allows redistribution of some skill points for a certain price. Some of the Skill changers can refund more points for a greater cost, depending on the character's level and amount of experience.\n\n===Factions===\nThere are seven factions within the game for which the player can complete quests to gain reputation.<ref name=igninterview>{{cite web | url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/786/786610p1.html | title=IGN: Building Two Worlds | last=Goldstein | first=Hilary | publisher=[[IGN]] | date=2007-05-09}}</ref> These are the Brotherhood, the Society, the Merchants Guild, the Giriza, the Necromancers, the House Skelden, and the Karga Clan.\n\n* The Brotherhood is a mercenary society. In the main cities of the game their location can be identified by their signature red banners. Brotherhood locations in cities will usually have a trainer that offers to teach the various combat skills for a small fee, and Brotherhood shops will have the largest selections of weapons and armor. The higher the rep in the Brotherhood the cheaper it is to buy supplies.\n* The Society is ''Two Worlds''' answer to the Guild of Mages seen in most RPGs. In the main cities their location can be identified by blue banners. The Society locations will usually have a trainer that offers to teach the various schools of magic for a small fee. Society shops will have robes, staves, and spells for sale.\n* The Merchants Guild is a guild of traders and merchants. In the main cities their location can be identified by banners emblazoned with scales. The shops of the Merchant Guild offer a general assortment of goods, the higher the reputation in the merchants guild the cheaper it is to buy supplies.\n* The Giriza is the equivalent of the Thieves' Guild. The members wear distinctive red hoods and the Giriza shops are a good source for lock picks and other thievery-related goods. Giriza trainers offer knowledge in the stealthy arts. The higher the reputation the more one can sell goods for.\n* The Necromancers are the only source that will teach the ability to use the Necromancy School of Magic, but are generally shunned by polite society. The Society makes a point of stopping Necromancers from completing their goals.\n* The House Skelden and the Karga Clan are two competing factions in the northern reaches of the human half of the world. The Karga Clan are the former ruling house that was supplanted by the King and Council with the House Skelden.\n\nThe player can choose to work with any faction to achieve specific goals in the main quest. As is typical for the genre, players generally earn reputation with a faction by completing appropriate quests.\n\n===Multiplayer===\nA multiplayer element is included, though it is not of the [[massively multiplayer online game]] type. Activities include horse racing, combat and quests. Single-player and multi-player characters are kept separate and not shared between modes. While the Xbox 360 version is limited to eight players, the PC version allows a significantly greater number. However, they must be grouped into parties of no more than eight. Using the multiplayer element in ''Two Worlds'' allows the user to change race; neither this nor the race of Elves are present in single player mode.\n\n==Plot==\n{{no plot|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Development and release==\n[[File:Two Worlds booth on Games Convention 2008 (2782773238).jpg|thumb|''Two Worlds'' booth at [[Games Convention|GC]] 2008]]\nThe game was initially announced by the Polish developer [[Reality Pump Studios|Reality Pump]] as ''Polanie 3'' or ''Knight Shift 2: Curse of Souls'', a sequel to a [[real time strategy]] game ''[[Polanie II]]'' (''Knight Shift''), that eventually lost all of its RTS elements and morphed into a computer role-playing game.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite web|url=https://technologie.onet.pl/gry/zrob-jakas-gre-rozmawiamy-z-miroslawem-dymkiem-tworca-kultowych-polan/3lbbr92|title=\"Zr\u00f3b jak\u0105\u015b gr\u0119\" - rozmawiamy z Miros\u0142awem Dymkiem, tw\u00f3rc\u0105 kultowych Polan|date=2015-03-25|website=technologie.onet.pl|language=pl|access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nTwo other versions of the game have been released.

In addition, there is an in-game Powerup Shop or Store which contains various items that one can purchase such as premium packages ([[freemium]] model). Paid services include exclusive items and Premiums which are a limited-time subscription providing many benefits.\n\n== Gameplay ==\nThe player controls a virtual character. After connecting to a server for the first time, players must take sides, choosing either El Morad or Karus. The two nations are equivalent but have different appearance. Once the nation is decided, it's a difficult and expensive process to switch nations. To [[Character creation#Role-playing games|create a character]], the player must choose (depending on the nation) a race, from Barbarian, male/female El Moradian, and the four ork races that inhabit the world. Following that, a class must be selected for the character along with a few appearance options. Finally the character is named and given its first 10 Stat Points.\n\nTo advance in the game, the player must collect [[experience point]]s to gain levels and items that boost the stats of the character. The [[Mob (computer gaming)|monsters]] that inhabit the game world can be attacked using melee attacks or skills. Once a monster is killed, the killing player gains experience points and the monster leaves behind a loot box which may contain Noahs (in-game currency) and other items. The drop box is only accessible to the player or party that did the most damage to the monster. However, in case of [[kill stealing]], the experience is divided according to the amount of damage done.\n\nMost items can be traded between players. The game's merchant feature allows the player to set up a [[kiosk]] to sell or buy items for Noahs. If a player has enough Noahs or the item sought for, he can enter the kiosk and perform the exchange. The transaction is done automatically, so the merchant doesn't have to be at the computer when the item is sold or bought. Bartering is also permissible using the trading option.\n\nEach character belongs to one of the two nations of the game: Humans and orks. Knight Online has four [[character class|character classes]] available for both nations. Each class has a basic skill set, three main skill sets, and one master skill set (after 2nd job change).\n\nKnight Online enables players to group together and complete objectives. Parties in Knight Online range between having two to eight players. The characters must be in a certain level range of the party leader in order to be in the same party. Party-members gain experience in accordance to their level. Knight Online encourages parties, since parties can collectively complete monster-killing quests.\n\nThe game is hosted on a couple of servers in each version. Servers are grouped into ''worlds''. No characters or items may be transferred across worlds, but a character created in a world is available on all servers of the world. A player may create up to 4 characters per world on the same account. These characters have a common \"bank\" which can be used for storing items and Noahs.\n\nKnight Online allows players to fight against each other in various zones. Some of these provide no rewards or risks, while in others players gain ''National Points'' and ''Leader Points'' (also called ''Ladder Points'') for killing enemies, but the defeated player loses some of these points.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.sultanwar.com/ Knight Online Pvp]\n* [https://www.sultanwar.com/ Knight Online Pvp Serverler]\n\n[[Category:2004 video games]]\n[[Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games]]\n[[Category:Video games developed in South Korea]]\n[[Category:Windows games]]\n[[Category:Windows-only games]]\n[[Category:2002 video games]]\n", "text_old": "{{primary sources|date=May 2007}}\n{{Infobox video game\n|title = Knight Online\n|image =\n|developer = {{ill|Mgame Corporation|tr}}, Noahsystem\n|publisher = [[MGame]]<br/>[[EGames (video game developer)|eGames]] (Malaysia)<br/>X-legend (Taiwan)<ref>Discontinued.

[[Turkish language|Turkish]] was similarly important as the primary language of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Koine Greek]] was the \"world language\" of the [[Hellenistic period]], but its distribution is not reflected in the distribution of [[Modern Greek]] due to the linguistic impact of the [[Slavs|Slavic]], [[Muslim conquests|Arabic]] and [[Turkic migration|Turkic]] expansions.

Thus, Russian was declared the \"world language of [[proletarian internationalism|internationalism]]\" in Soviet literature, which at the same time denounced French as the \"language of fancy courtiers\" and English as the \"jargon of traders\".<ref name=\"Pei105\">Pei, p. 105</ref> A number of [[international auxiliary languages]] have been introduced as prospective world languages, the most successful of them being [[Esperanto]], but none were learned by as many people as the world languages were.

Those appointed decided to hire city officials, including a chief constable. On February 23, 1874, John S. Ingram was appointed the first Chief of Police of Winnipeg.<ref name=PoliceHistory>{{cite web|title=History & Formation|url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/police/DepartmentHistories/|publisher=City of Winnipeg|accessdate=26 November 2013|date=10 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1919 [[Winnipeg General Strike]], most of the force was replaced with 2000 better-paid special constables, for refusing to sign a declaration promising to not belong to a union or participate in a sympathy strike, even though they remained on duty during the strike. The union was thus broken, and Chris H. Newton became the acting chief constable.\n\nIn 1972, Winnipeg merged with its eight neighbouring communities, causing their [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]], but still having eight police services with different uniforms and radio channels. The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) contract for Charleswood and Headingly was cancelled, and that area fell under the inner city patrol area. On October 21, 1974, the amalgamation of the services was complete, and the remaining eight services formed into six districts. On January 1, 1975, all police officers in Winnipeg started to wear the same uniform with matching shoulder flashes that stated, \"One, with the strength of many\".\n\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0em 1em 1em 0em; border:1px #e3e3e3 solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#aabbcc\"\n! colspan= \"2\" | Police chief constables<br /><small>pre-amalgamation</small>\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ccbbaa\"\n| Police chief constable \n| Years served\n|- align=\"center\"\n| John S.

Dale Henry, a retired RCMP officer and former commander of the Manitoba \"D\" Division, was selected as the first chief of police not from the service's own ranks. Henry was well respected amongst minorities and sought to change and improve the image of police in Winnipeg. One of the most noticeable changes was the name for the police, from the \"Winnipeg Police Force\" (which it had been for 120 years), to the \"Winnipeg Police Service\". Another change was the addition of the motto \"Community Commitment\".\n\nHenry also changed the department crest to the one known today and pictured above. The 13 golden stars on the badge represent the 13 communities that came together to form Winnipeg during the amalgamation in the 1970s, and the crocus is the provincial flower.\n\nIn 2003, city council approved a plan by the Winnipeg Police Service to go from six districts, to four. This plan involved three new police facilities.

Harper: 15 Years Later'', 2008.]</ref> Harper grabbed the officer's service revolver and while struggle ensued the gun went off, killing Harper. Initially, this shooting was ruled as justified by the internal firearms board of enquiry.<ref>[http://www.ajic.mb.ca/volumelll/chapter6.html The Aboriginal Justice Implementation Commission, ''The exoneration'', 1991.]</ref> Subsequently, however, the shooting and other events led to the [[Aboriginal Justice Inquiry]], a comprehensive investigation into the treatment of First Nations people within the Manitoba justice system. In 1991, the inquiry concluded that the WPS internal investigation was faulty and intended more to exonerate Cross than to discover the truth. Furthermore, they ruled that Constable Cross had used excessive force and was therefore responsible for Harper's death even though Harper grabbed at the officer's revolver. Constable Cross left the department citing stress and died prematurely of heart disease in his 40s.

1873, an election was held to select the city's new mayor and [[Alderman|aldermen]]. Those appointed decided to hire city officials, including a chief constable. On February 23, 1874, John S. Ingram was appointed the first Chief of Police of Winnipeg.<ref name=PoliceHistory>{{cite web|title=History & Formation|url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/police/DepartmentHistories/|publisher=City of Winnipeg|accessdate=26 November 2013|date=10 August 2007}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1919 [[Winnipeg General Strike]], most of the force was replaced with 2000 better-paid special constables, for refusing to sign a declaration promising to not belong to a union or participate in a sympathy strike, even though they remained on duty during the strike. The union was thus broken, and Chris H. Newton became the acting chief constable.\n\nIn 1972, Winnipeg merged with its eight neighbouring communities, causing their [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamation]], but still having eight police services with different uniforms and radio channels. The [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] (RCMP) contract for Charleswood and Headingly was cancelled, and that area fell under the inner city patrol area. On October 21, 1974, the amalgamation of the services was complete, and the remaining eight services formed into six districts. On January 1, 1975, all police officers in Winnipeg started to wear the same uniform with matching shoulder flashes that stated, \"One, with the strength of many\".\n\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0em 1em 1em 0em; border:1px #e3e3e3 solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\"\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#aabbcc\"\n! colspan= \"2\" | Police chief constables<br /><small>pre-amalgamation</small>\n|- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#ccbbaa\"\n| Police chief constable \n| Years served\n|- align=\"center\"\n| John S.

Dale Henry, a retired RCMP officer and former commander of the Manitoba \"D\" Division, was selected as the first chief of police not from the service's own ranks. Henry was well respected amongst minorities and sought to change and improve the image of police in Winnipeg. One of the most noticeable changes was the name for the police, from the \"Winnipeg Police Force\" (which it had been for 120 years), to the \"Winnipeg Police Service\". Another change was the addition of the motto \"Community Commitment\".\n\nHenry also changed the department crest to the one known today and pictured above. The 13 golden stars on the badge represent the 13 communities that came together to form Winnipeg during the amalgamation in the 1970s, and the crocus is the provincial flower.\n\nIn 2003, city council approved a plan by the Winnipeg Police Service to go from six districts, to four. This plan involved three new police facilities. The new East District Station was completed in 2008, and the West District Station was completed in November 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Four District Model|url=http://winnipeg.ca/police/fourdistrict/|publisher=City of Winnipeg|accessdate=10 December 2013|date=8 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212232131/http://winnipeg.ca/police/fourdistrict/|archive-date=December 12, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Administration==\nThe Winnipeg Police Service  is headed by  Chief of Police Danny Smyth, appointed November 8, 2016, succeeding Chief Devon Clunis who retired July 9, 2016.

The service has 1,442 officers of which approximately half are on the front lines, known as \"general patrol\" (uniform operations). The WPS also has over 510 civilian workers.\n\n== Operations ==\nThe Winnipeg Police Service headquarters is located at 266 Graham Avenue, in the former Canada Post sortation facility, in the downtown area.

After this process is finished the recruit is inducted into the police service. After five years of general patrol service, officers may apply for specialty divisions like those listed above.\n\n==Winnipeg Police Museum==\nThe Winnipeg Police Museum is a museum that displays the history of the Winnipeg Police Service from 1874 to the present.

Harper: 15 Years Later'', 2008.]</ref> Harper grabbed the officer's service revolver and while struggle ensued the gun went off, killing Harper. Initially, this shooting was ruled as justified by the internal firearms board of enquiry.<ref>[http://www.ajic.mb.ca/volumelll/chapter6.html The Aboriginal Justice Implementation Commission, ''The exoneration'', 1991.]</ref> Subsequently, however, the shooting and other events led to the [[Aboriginal Justice Inquiry]], a comprehensive investigation into the treatment of First Nations people within the Manitoba justice system. In 1991, the inquiry concluded that the WPS internal investigation was faulty and intended more to exonerate Cross than to discover the truth. Furthermore, they ruled that Constable Cross had used excessive force and was therefore responsible for Harper's death even though Harper grabbed at the officer's revolver. Constable Cross left the department citing stress and died prematurely of heart disease in his 40s.

He was most well known for his [[science fiction]] [[lolicon]]-themed works appearing in magazines such as ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion]]'', as well as children's comedy series such as ''[[Nanako SOS]]'' and ''[[Little Pollon]]'' (which both became [[anime]] television series in the early 1980s).

In 1968, after graduating from high school, he moved to [[Tokyo]] and found employment with [[Toppan Printing]]. He left this job after three months to work as an assistant to manga artist [[Rentar\u014d Itai]], where he did uncredited work for ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'' on series such as ''Mini Mini Manga''.\n\nAzuma made his professional debut in 1969 in ''[[Manga \u014c]]'' with his work ''Ringside Crazy''. The following year he quit working as  an assistant and doing his own work. He gradually expanded his work to include both [[sh\u014djo manga|sh\u014djo]] and [[seinen manga]]. His first works tended to be light [[joke|gag]] manga, though he began to include [[science fiction]] elements influenced by his being a fan of the [[New Hollywood]] movement in [[United States of America|American]] [[film]]. It was during this period that he experimented a lot with one panel manga (as opposed to [[yonkoma|four panel]]).\n\nBeginning in 1972, Azuma began rising in popularity due to the [[off-color humor]] in his ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion]]'' series ''Futari to 5-nin''. He also married his assistant the same year, with whom he had a girl in 1980 and a boy in 1983. His wife was credited as \"Assistant A\" in his works, and his daughter and son were respectively credited as \"Assistant B\" and \"Assistant C\".\n\n===Boom period===\nAzuma began serializing in 1975 his story ''Yakekuso Tenshi'' in the [[semimonthly]] manga magazine ''[[Play Comic]]''.  He also began publishing [[list of science fiction themes|science fiction themed]] works in many different [[Niche market|niche]] magazines such as ''[[Kis\u014d Tengai]]'' and ''Peke''. Azuma, together with [[Jun Ishikawa]], is considered part of the manga creators in the 1970s. Due to works such as science fiction novel parody ''Fuj\u014dri Nikki'', published in ''[[Bessatsu Kis\u014d Tengai]]'' in 1978, Azuma began to gain a large following among science fiction fans. ''Fuj\u014dri Nikki'' was awarded the 1979 [[Seiun Award]] for [[Seiun Award#Best Comic of the Year|Best Comic of the Year]].\n\nFrom there, he began publishing in magazines such as ''[[Sh\u014djo Alice]]'', becoming a fixture in the [[hentai|pornographic]] lolicon manga business and becoming very involved in [[otaku]] culture.\n\nIn the late 1980s and into the 1990s, due to stress from his hectic and demanding schedule during 20 years (to that point) as a manga artist, Azuma began [[alcoholism|drinking heavily]], disappeared twice for several months to over a year, attempted [[suicide]] at least once, and was finally forcibly committed to an [[alcohol rehabilitation]] program.<ref name=\"ann-review\"/><ref name=\"cwr\">{{cite web|url=http://comicsworthreading.com/2008/09/03/disappearance-diary/ |title=Disappearance Diary |first=Ed |last=Sizemore |date=2008-09-03 |publisher=Comics Worth Reading |accessdate=2008-11-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014200531/http://comicsworthreading.com/2008/09/03/disappearance-diary/ |archivedate=2008-10-14 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.readaboutcomics.com/2008/10/27/disappearance-diary/|title=Disappearance Diary|first=Greg|last=McElhatton|publisher=Read About Comics|date=2008-10-27|accessdate=2008-11-22}}</ref> He published in 2005 a manga journal of this experience titled ''[[Disappearance Diary]]''.

Azuma made his professional debut in 1969 in the [[Akita Shoten]] manga magazine ''[[Manga \u014c]]''. He was most well known for his [[science fiction]] [[lolicon]]-themed works appearing in magazines such as ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion]]'', as well as children's comedy series such as ''[[Nanako SOS]]'' and ''[[Little Pollon]]'' (which both became [[anime]] television series in the early 1980s).

In 1968, after graduating from high school, he moved to [[Tokyo]] and found employment with [[Toppan Printing]]. He left this job after three months to work as an assistant to manga artist [[Rentar\u014d Itai]], where he did uncredited work for ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'' on series such as ''Mini Mini Manga''.\n\nAzuma made his professional debut in 1969 in ''[[Manga \u014c]]'' with his work ''Ringside Crazy''. The following year he quit working as  an assistant and doing his own work. He gradually expanded his work to include both [[sh\u014djo manga|sh\u014djo]] and [[seinen manga]]. His first works tended to be light [[joke|gag]] manga, though he began to include [[science fiction]] elements influenced by his being a fan of the [[New Hollywood]] movement in [[United States of America|American]] [[film]]. It was during this period that he experimented a lot with one panel manga (as opposed to [[yonkoma|four panel]]).\n\nBeginning in 1972, Azuma began rising in popularity due to the [[off-color humor]] in his ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion]]'' series ''Futari to 5-nin''. He also married his assistant the same year, with whom he had a girl in 1980 and a boy in 1983. His wife was credited as \"Assistant A\" in his works, and his daughter and son were respectively credited as \"Assistant B\" and \"Assistant C\".\n\n===Boom period===\nAzuma began serializing in 1975 his story ''Yakekuso Tenshi'' in the [[semimonthly]] manga magazine ''[[Play Comic]]''.  He also began publishing [[list of science fiction themes|science fiction themed]] works in many different [[Niche market|niche]] magazines such as ''[[Kis\u014d Tengai]]'' and ''Peke''. Azuma, together with [[Jun Ishikawa]], is considered part of the manga creators in the 1970s. Due to works such as science fiction novel parody ''Fuj\u014dri Nikki'', published in ''[[Bessatsu Kis\u014d Tengai]]'' in 1978, Azuma began to gain a large following among science fiction fans.
