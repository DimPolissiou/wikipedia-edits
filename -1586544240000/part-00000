An example of global environmental racism is the process in which the locations of hazardous waste facilities are higher in vulnerable communities compared to that of other areas.  This is most commonly seen in the USA as the environmental racism gap is very prevalent in many states across the country.  Environmental racism races ethical issues but can also has implications for a state's laws and constitution, for example the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|\u201cclean air act]]\u201d, \u201cthe [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourteenth amendment]]\u201d and the \u201c[[Civil Rights Act of 1964|civil rights act]]\u201d. \n\nAn example of a case of environmental racism is a small mainly African American (90%) town called [[Uniontown, Alabama|Uniontown]] located in Alabama where there is a toxic landfill which is believed to have caused serious health issues in the area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/15/were-not-a-dump-poor-alabama-towns-struggle-under-the-stench-of-toxic-landfills|title='We're not a dump' \u2013 poor Alabama towns struggle under the stench of toxic landfills|last=Milman|first=Oliver|date=2019-04-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Concerns include things such as mental health issues, a one-in-five chance of developing cancer and deficiencies in reproduction due to the toxins such as mercury and arsenic contained within the ash. The toxic landfill is used to dump millions of tons of coal ash which comes from mainly white wealthier areas.

Much hazardous waste in Africa is not actually produced there but rather was exported by developed countries such as the U.S; even though much of this exportation of waste took place in the 1980s Africa is still left with the problem of toxic waste sites to this day<ref name=\":5\">{{Citation|chapter=The transboundary shipments of hazardous wastes|date=1998-04-23|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780419218906|doi=10.4324/9780203476901.ch4|title=International Trade in Hazardous Wastes}}</ref>.\n\n== Income inequality ==\n[[File:Environmntal Kuznets Curve.png|alt=Environmental Kuznets curve showing an increase in environmental damage during industrial development followed by a decrease.|thumb|Environmental Kuznets curve showing an increase in environmental damage during industrial development followed by a decrease.]]\nThe relationship between economic inequality and environmental inequality plays a large roll in understanding certain reasons that account for the cause of environmental inequality. The association between income inequality and environmental inequality can be measured by the environmental [[Kuznets curve]]. This curve states that when income per capita is high, the rate of pollution in that area rises until income reaches a certain threshold, once this threshold of wealth is passed then pollution in that area begins to decrease.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Economic Inequality and Environmental Quality: Evidence of Pollution Shifting in Russia |author=Vornovytskyy, Marina S. |author2=Boyce, James K. |date=2010-01-01|publisher=ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst|oclc=698200672}}</ref> In the case of developing nations an increase in pollution and production of greenhouse gases occurs as that nation undergoes economic growth, therefore for developing nations to escape poverty through growth pollution must be produced. This pollution is often caused through industry and manufacturing. Once the developing nation becomes a developed nation then we begin to see a drop off in pollution as a better alternative to high pollution industry can be found to stimulate the economy. Renewable energy has been more expensive to produce and maintain than traditional energy produced by fossil fuels and has only recently become as cost efficient as fossil fuels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2018/04/24/production-cost-of-renewable-energy-now-lower-than-fossil-fuels/|title=Production Cost Of Renewable Energy Now 'Lower' Than Fossil Fuels|last=Sharma|first=Gaurav|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref> Since the discovery of greener energy sources only richer developed nations have been able to invest and integrate renewable energy into their power production industries. \n\nIn countries such as Russia it has been found that in areas where income was higher that there was an increase in uncontrolled air pollution. However while income may have been higher in these regions a greater disparity in income inequality was found. It was discovered that \"greater income inequality within a region is associated with more pollution, implying that it is not only the level of income that matters but also its distribution\"<ref name=\":1\" />. In Russia areas lacking in hospital beds suffer from greater air pollution than areas with higher numbers of beds per capita which implies that the poor or inadequate distribution of public services also may add to the environmental inequality of that region.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAnother consequence of income inequality's association with environmental inequality is the environmental privilege of consumers in developed countries, \"consumers of goods and services that are produced by polluting industries often are spatially and socially separated from the people who bear the impacts of the pollution\"<ref name=\":1\" />. Those who are working in the production of consumer goods suffer a disproportionate amount the consequences of environmental deterioration that their more affluent consumer counterparts.\n\n=== Inequality in the United States ===\nIn the United States it was also found that income inequality greatly affected the quality of the environment in which people live. People of colour and the poor in America on average experience much lower quality environments then white people or the wealthy.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Salazar|first=Debra J.|last2=Clauson|first2=Stacy|last3=Abel|first3=Troy D.|last4=Clauson|first4=Aran|date=2019-02-25|title=Race, Income, and Environmental Inequality in the U.S. States, 1990-2014*|journal=Social Science Quarterly|doi=10.1111/ssqu.12608|issn=0038-4941}}</ref>  Action was taken in the early 1990s by the American Government in an attempt to improve environmental quality for poorer regions. In 1992 the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] set up the Office of Environmental Equity, now known as the Office of Environmental Justice, to address the situation at hand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice|title=Environmental Justice|last=US EPA|first=OA|date=2014-11-03|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref> However the Office of Environmental Justice's work was undermined by congress who refused to pass the bills which were presented to them by the EPA.<ref name=\":2\" />  Instead states began to pass their own bills which did very little to improve environmental quality for poorer areas.

In recent years we have seen a change in China's production industry in relation from  the movement from the [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector]] of production moving into the [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]].  China's urbanization has caused a rise in the production of factories. In China factories create harmful waste such as nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide which cause health risk. Journalist and science writer Fred Pearce notes that in China \"most monitoring of urban air still concentrates on one or at most two pollutants, sometimes particulates, sometimes nitrogen oxides or sulfur dioxides or ozone. Similarly, most medical studies of the impacts of these toxins look for links between single pollutants and suspected health effects such as respiratory disease and cardiovascular conditions.\"<ref name=\":6\">How a \u2018Toxic Cocktail\u2019 Is Posing a Troubling Health Risk in China\u2019s Cities by Fred Pearce https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-a-toxic-cocktail-is-posing-a-troubling-health-risk-in-chinese-cities  </ref>  The country emits about a third of all the human-made sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulates that are poured into the air around the world.<ref name=\":6\" /> The Global Burden of Disease Study, an international collaboration, estimates that 1.1 million Chinese die from the effects of this air pollution each year, roughly a third of the global death toll.\"<ref>How a \u2018Toxic Cocktail\u2019 Is Posing a Troubling Health Risk in China\u2019s Cities by Fred Pearce https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-a-toxic-cocktail-is-posing-a-troubling-health-risk-in-chinese-cities </ref>  The economic cost of deaths due to air pollution is estimated at 267 billion yuan (US$38 billion) per year. <ref>Air pollution is killing 1 million people and costing Chinese economy 267 billion yuan a year, research from CUHK shows Two pollutants were found to cause an average 1.1 million premature deaths in the country each year and are destroying 20 million tonnes of rice, wheat, maize and soybean by Ernest Kao Published: 8:00am, 2 Oct, 2018</ref>\n== Climate change and environmental inequality ==\nThe main issue faced by developed countries in the western world is [[climate change]].

For example, in the summer of 2018, Ireland experienced the hottest summer on record since 1976 <ref name=\":3\" />. This heatwave lead to a 53 day period of \"absolute drought conditions\", and as a result, there was an increase in crop failures. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/irish-summer-weather-2018-4220959-Sep2018/|title=Met Eireann confirm summer 2018 as one of hottest and driest in decades|last=McDermott|first=Stephen|website=TheJournal.ie|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> The increase in frequency of these extreme events affect the stability of food supplies and thus food security.  When food supplies get damaged by weather, access to food also becomes damaged. When developing countries are faced with extreme events, and certain crops can no longer be produced due to sustainability, the access to certain foods, such as cereals and exotic fruits, become unavailable to the people living in developed countries. The areas that will be mostly affected by crop failure are found in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia. This means that the regions that will be exposed to the highest degree of instability in food production are the poorest regions in developing countries. <ref name=\":0\" /> Climate change will affect all dimensions of food security, in particular food availability, access to food, and stability of food supplies.

Environmental racism races ethical issues but can also has implications for a state's laws and constitution, for example the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|\u201cclean air act]]\u201d, \u201cthe [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|fourteenth amendment]]\u201d and the \u201c[[Civil Rights Act of 1964|civil rights act]]\u201d. \n\nAn example of a case of environmental racism is a small mainly African American (90%) town called [[Uniontown, Alabama|Uniontown]] located in Alabama where there is a toxic landfill which is believed to have caused serious health issues in the area.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/15/were-not-a-dump-poor-alabama-towns-struggle-under-the-stench-of-toxic-landfills|title='We're not a dump' \u2013 poor Alabama towns struggle under the stench of toxic landfills|last=Milman|first=Oliver|date=2019-04-15|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Concerns include things such as mental health issues, a one-in-five chance of developing cancer and deficiencies in reproduction due to the toxins such as mercury and arsenic contained within the ash. The toxic landfill is used to dump millions of tons of coal ash which comes from mainly white wealthier areas.  [[Uniontown, Alabama|Uniontown]] is not an isolated case as it can be seen there are many examples across the states such as [[Flint, Michigan|Flint Michigan]] who are dealing with a [[Flint water crisis|major water crisis]]''',''' [[West Dallas|West Dallas Texas]] where African American housing projects have been set up twenty paces from a battery recycling smelter, and [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester Pennsylvania]] which has become an attraction for toxic waste sites.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/feb/21/philadelphia-covanta-incinerator-recyclables-china-ban-imports|title='Moment of reckoning': US cities burn recyclables after China bans imports|last=Milman|first=Oliver|date=2019-02-21|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-04-16|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> In California the government also decided to allow pollution in vulnerable communities.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pulido|first=Laura|date=2016|title=Geographies of race and ethnicity II: Environmental racism, racial capitalism and state-sanctioned violence|journal=Progress in Human Geography|language=en|volume=41|issue=4|pages=524\u2013533|doi=10.1177/0309132516646495|issn=0309-1325|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b04a5247f90128b3c523777a5118c8888b99c84f}}</ref> The effect of environmental racism is seen in the health data which shows that African Americans are three times more likely to die from asthma.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Polluted promises : environmental racism and the search for justice in a southern town|last=Checker, Melissa|date=2005|publisher=New York University Press|isbn=0814716571|oclc=58535804}}</ref> Three out of five African Americans live in a community with a least one toxic waste site.<ref name=\":4\" /> On average it takes twenty percent longer for toxic sites in minority community towns to be placed on the national priority list than white areas<ref name=\":4\" />.\n\nEnvironmental racism is not only seen in the developed world but it is also prevalent in the developing world.  Much hazardous waste in Africa is not actually produced there but rather was exported by developed countries such as the U.S; even though much of this exportation of waste took place in the 1980s Africa is still left with the problem of toxic waste sites to this day<ref name=\":5\">{{Citation|chapter=The transboundary shipments of hazardous wastes|date=1998-04-23|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780419218906|doi=10.4324/9780203476901.ch4|title=International Trade in Hazardous Wastes}}</ref>.\n\n== Income inequality ==\n[[File:Environmntal Kuznets Curve.png|alt=Environmental Kuznets curve showing an increase in environmental damage during industrial development followed by a decrease.|thumb|Environmental Kuznets curve showing an increase in environmental damage during industrial development followed by a decrease.]]\nThe relationship between economic inequality and environmental inequality plays a large roll in understanding certain reasons that account for the cause of environmental inequality. The association between income inequality and environmental inequality can be measured by the environmental [[Kuznets curve]]. This curve states that when income per capita is high, the rate of pollution in that area rises until income reaches a certain threshold, once this threshold of wealth is passed then pollution in that area begins to decrease.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Economic Inequality and Environmental Quality: Evidence of Pollution Shifting in Russia |author=Vornovytskyy, Marina S. |author2=Boyce, James K. |date=2010-01-01|publisher=ScholarWorks@UMass Amherst|oclc=698200672}}</ref> In the case of developing nations an increase in pollution and production of greenhouse gases occurs as that nation undergoes economic growth, therefore for developing nations to escape poverty through growth pollution must be produced. This pollution is often caused through industry and manufacturing. Once the developing nation becomes a developed nation then we begin to see a drop off in pollution as a better alternative to high pollution industry can be found to stimulate the economy. Renewable energy has been more expensive to produce and maintain than traditional energy produced by fossil fuels and has only recently become as cost efficient as fossil fuels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2018/04/24/production-cost-of-renewable-energy-now-lower-than-fossil-fuels/|title=Production Cost Of Renewable Energy Now 'Lower' Than Fossil Fuels|last=Sharma|first=Gaurav|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2019-04-07}}</ref> Since the discovery of greener energy sources only richer developed nations have been able to invest and integrate renewable energy into their power production industries. \n\nIn countries such as Russia it has been found that in areas where income was higher that there was an increase in uncontrolled air pollution. However while income may have been higher in these regions a greater disparity in income inequality was found. It was discovered that \"greater income inequality within a region is associated with more pollution, implying that it is not only the level of income that matters but also its distribution\"<ref name=\":1\" />. In Russia areas lacking in hospital beds suffer from greater air pollution than areas with higher numbers of beds per capita which implies that the poor or inadequate distribution of public services also may add to the environmental inequality of that region.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nAnother consequence of income inequality's association with environmental inequality is the environmental privilege of consumers in developed countries, \"consumers of goods and services that are produced by polluting industries often are spatially and socially separated from the people who bear the impacts of the pollution\"<ref name=\":1\" />. Those who are working in the production of consumer goods suffer a disproportionate amount the consequences of environmental deterioration that their more affluent consumer counterparts.\n\n=== Inequality in the United States ===\nIn the United States it was also found that income inequality greatly affected the quality of the environment in which people live. People of colour and the poor in America on average experience much lower quality environments then white people or the wealthy.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Salazar|first=Debra J.|last2=Clauson|first2=Stacy|last3=Abel|first3=Troy D.|last4=Clauson|first4=Aran|date=2019-02-25|title=Race, Income, and Environmental Inequality in the U.S. States, 1990-2014*|journal=Social Science Quarterly|doi=10.1111/ssqu.12608|issn=0038-4941}}</ref>  Action was taken in the early 1990s by the American Government in an attempt to improve environmental quality for poorer regions. In 1992 the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] set up the Office of Environmental Equity, now known as the Office of Environmental Justice, to address the situation at hand.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice|title=Environmental Justice|last=US EPA|first=OA|date=2014-11-03|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref> However the Office of Environmental Justice's work was undermined by congress who refused to pass the bills which were presented to them by the EPA.<ref name=\":2\" />  Instead states began to pass their own bills which did very little to improve environmental quality for poorer areas.

In recent years we have seen a change in China's production industry in relation from  the movement from the [[Primary sector of the economy|primary sector]] of production moving into the [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]].  China's urbanization has caused a rise in the production of factories. In China factories create harmful waste such as nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide which cause health risk. Journalist and science writer Fred Pearce notes that in China \"most monitoring of urban air still concentrates on one or at most two pollutants, sometimes particulates, sometimes nitrogen oxides or sulfur dioxides or ozone. Similarly, most medical studies of the impacts of these toxins look for links between single pollutants and suspected health effects such as respiratory disease and cardiovascular conditions.\"<ref name=\":6\">How a \u2018Toxic Cocktail\u2019 Is Posing a Troubling Health Risk in China\u2019s Cities by Fred Pearce https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-a-toxic-cocktail-is-posing-a-troubling-health-risk-in-chinese-cities  </ref>  The country emits about a third of all the human-made sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and particulates that are poured into the air around the world.<ref name=\":6\" /> The Global Burden of Disease Study, an international collaboration, estimates that 1.1 million Chinese die from the effects of this air pollution each year, roughly a third of the global death toll.\"<ref>How a \u2018Toxic Cocktail\u2019 Is Posing a Troubling Health Risk in China\u2019s Cities by Fred Pearce https://e360.yale.edu/features/how-a-toxic-cocktail-is-posing-a-troubling-health-risk-in-chinese-cities </ref>  The economic cost of deaths due to air pollution is estimated at 267 billion yuan (US$38 billion) per year. <ref>Air pollution is killing 1 million people and costing Chinese economy 267 billion yuan a year, research from CUHK shows Two pollutants were found to cause an average 1.1 million premature deaths in the country each year and are destroying 20 million tonnes of rice, wheat, maize and soybean by Ernest Kao Published: 8:00am, 2 Oct, 2018</ref>\n== Climate change and environmental inequality ==\nThe main issue faced by developed countries in the western world is [[climate change]]. Climate change and its effects are being escalated due to the actions of many developed countries. The use of fossil fuels has resulted in an increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide by 33% in the past 150 years.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TKOhTRyFVIkC&pg=PR9&dq=climate+change+causes#v=onepage&q=climate%20change%20causes&f=false|title=Climate Change: Causes, Effects, and Solutions|last=Hardy|first=John T.|date=2003-06-27|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780470850190|language=en}}</ref>  However, the effects of climate change will be worse in areas with less food security.  Due to the changes in temperature and precipitation, combined with the increase in levels of greenhouse gasses emitted, it is becoming more and more difficult to produce sustainable crops.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/|title=IPCC \u2014 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Chapter 7, Food Security and Food Production|access-date=2019-04-16}}</ref> This dangerous combination leads to constant fluctuating levels of trade. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Schmidhuber|first=J.|last2=Tubiello|first2=F.

With the demand for food expected to increase by 50% by 2030 alongside a growing population, food security is becoming vital.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Wheeler|first=T.|last2=von Braun|first2=J.|date=2013-08-01|title=Climate Change Impacts on Global Food Security|journal=Science|volume=341|issue=6145|pages=508\u2013513|doi=10.1126/science.1239402|pmid=23908229|issn=0036-8075}}</ref> In temperate latitudes, higher temperatures are expected to benefit agriculture, as the areas that are potentially suitable for cropping will expand, and the length of the growing period will also increase.\n\nHowever, with the rise in temperature, comes a rise in extreme events, such as heatwaves which may lead to drought. For example, in the summer of 2018, Ireland experienced the hottest summer on record since 1976 <ref name=\":3\" />. This heatwave lead to a 53 day period of \"absolute drought conditions\", and as a result, there was an increase in crop failures. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/irish-summer-weather-2018-4220959-Sep2018/|title=Met Eireann confirm summer 2018 as one of hottest and driest in decades|last=McDermott|first=Stephen|website=TheJournal.ie|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> The increase in frequency of these extreme events affect the stability of food supplies and thus food security.  When food supplies get damaged by weather, access to food also becomes damaged. When developing countries are faced with extreme events, and certain crops can no longer be produced due to sustainability, the access to certain foods, such as cereals and exotic fruits, become unavailable to the people living in developed countries. The areas that will be mostly affected by crop failure are found in sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South Asia. This means that the regions that will be exposed to the highest degree of instability in food production are the poorest regions in developing countries. <ref name=\":0\" /> Climate change will affect all dimensions of food security, in particular food availability, access to food, and stability of food supplies. The overall impact of climate change on food security will affect both developing countries and developed countries, however, the effects will be felt differently across regions and over different periods of time.<ref name=\":0\" />  \n \n== See also ==\n* [[Netherlands fallacy]]\n\n== References ==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags, these references will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External Links ==\n*[https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice Environmental Justice, Environmental Protection Agency]\n*[https://www.ipcc.ch/ The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]\n<!--- Categories --->\n\n[[Category:Globalization]]\n[[Category:Inequality]]\n[[Category:Environment and society]]\n", "name_user": "Daask", "label": "safe", "comment": "linkenvironmental racismusingFind link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_environmental_inequality"}

Sandpaper is produced in a range of grit sizes and is used to remove material from surfaces, either to make them smoother (for example, in [[house painter and decorator|painting]] and [[wood finishing]]), to remove a layer of material (such as old [[paint]]), or sometimes to make the surface rougher (for example, as a preparation for [[adhesive|gluing]]).

Cloth backing is used for sandpaper discs and belts, while [[mylar]] is used as backing for extremely fine grits. Fibre or [[Vulcanization|vulcanized]] fibre is a strong backing material consisting of many layers of polymer impregnated paper. The weight of the backing is usually designated by a letter. For paper backings, the weight ratings range from \"A\" to \"F\", with A designating the lightest and F the heaviest. Letter nomenclature follows a different system for cloth backings, with the weight of the backing rated J, X, Y, T, and M, from lightest to heaviest. A flexible backing allows sandpaper to follow irregular contours of a workpiece; relatively inflexible backing is optimal for regular rounded or flat surfaces. Sandpaper backings may be glued to the paper or form a separate support structure for moving sandpaper, such as used in sanding belts and discs. Stronger paper or backing increases the ease of sanding wood. The harder the backing material, the faster the sanding, the faster the wear of the paper and the rougher the sanded surface.\n\n===Type of abrasive===\nTypes of abrasive materials include:\n* [[glass]]: no longer commonly used\n* [[flint]]: no longer commonly used\n* [[garnet]]: commonly used in [[woodworking]]\n* [[emery (mineral)|emery]]: commonly used to abrade or polish metals\n* [[aluminium oxide]]: The most common in modern use, with the widest variety of grits, lowest unit cost; can be used on metal (i.e. body shops) or wood\n* [[silicon carbide]]: available in very coarse grits all the way through to microgrits, common in wet applications\n* alumina-zirconia: (an aluminium oxide\u2013[[zirconium oxide]] alloy), used for machine grinding applications\n* [[chromium(III) oxide]]: used in extremely fine micron grit ([[micrometre]] level) papers\n* [[diamond]]: used for finishing and polishing hard metals, ceramics and glass\n* [[ceramic aluminum oxide]]: used in high pressure applications, used in both coated abrasives, as well as in bonded abrasives.\n\nSandpaper may be \"[[stearate]]d\" where a dry lubricant is loaded to the abrasive. Stearated papers are useful in sanding coats of finish and paint as the stearate \"[[soap]]\" prevents clogging and increases the useful life of the sandpaper.\n\nThe harder the grit material, the easier the sanding of surfaces like wood. The grit material for polishing granite slab must be harder than [[granite]].\n\n===Bonds===\nDifferent adhesives are used to bond the abrasive to the paper. [[Animal glue#Hide glue|Hide glue]] is still used, but this glue often cannot withstand the heat generated during machine sanding and is not waterproof. '''Waterproof sandpapers''' or '''wet/dry sandpapers''' use a resin bond and a waterproof backing.\n\nSandpapers can also be '''open coat''', where the particles are separated from each other and the sandpaper is more flexible. This helps prevent clogging of the sandpaper. Wet and dry sandpaper is more effective used wet because clogging is reduced by particles washing away from the grinding surface. Arguably there are also benefits due to lubrication and cooling.\n\n===Shapes===\n\nSandpaper comes in a number of different shapes and sizes:\n\n* sheet: usually {{convert|9|by|11|in|cm}}, but other sizes may be available\n* belt: usually cloth backed, comes in different sizes to fit different [[belt sander]]s.\n* disk: made to fit different models of disc and random orbit sanders. May be perforated for some models of sanders. Attachment includes pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) and \"[[Hook and loop fastener|hook-and-loop]]\" (similar to Velcro).\n* rolls: known as \"shag rolls\" by many contractors\n* sponge: for tight places\n\n==Grit sizes==\nGrit size refers to the size of the particles of abrading materials embedded in the sandpaper. Several standards have been established for grit size. These standards establish not only the average grit size, but also the allowable variation from the average. The two most common are the United States CAMI (Coated Abrasive Manufacturers Institute, now part of the Unified Abrasives Manufacturer's Association) and the European FEPA (Federation of European Producers of Abrasives) \"P\" grade. The FEPA system is the same as the [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[ISO 6344|6344]] standard. Other systems used in sandpaper include the [[Japanese Industrial Standards Committee]] (JIS), the micron grade (generally used for very fine grits). The \"aught\" system ({0, 00, 000, ...} aka {1/0, 2/0, 3/0, ...}) was used in the past in the US. Cheaper sandpapers sometimes use nomenclature such as \"Coarse\", \"Medium\" and \"Fine\", but it is unclear to what standards these names refer.\n\n===Grit size table===\nThe following table, compiled from the references at the bottom, compares the CAMI and \"P\" designations with the average grit size in micrometres (\u00b5m).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Grit size table\n!\n!ISO/FEPA Grit designation\n!CAMI Grit designation\n!Average particle diameter (\u00b5m)\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"background-color: #EFEFAC; font-weight: bold\"|MACROGRITS\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"9\"|Extra Coarse (Very fast removal of material, [[hardwood flooring]] initial sanding)\n|align=\"center\"|P12\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1815\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P16\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1324\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P20\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1000\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P24\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|764\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|align=\"center\"|708\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P30\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|642\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|30\n|align=\"center\"|632\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|36\n|align=\"center\"|530\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P36\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|538\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"3\"|Coarse (Rapid removal of material)\n|align=\"center\"|P40\n|align=\"center\"|40\n|align=\"center\"|425\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|50\n|align=\"center\"|348\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P50\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|336\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Medium (sanding bare wood in preparation for finishing, for gentle removal of varnish, also used for skateboard grip tape)\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|60\n|align=\"center\"|265\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P60\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|269\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P80\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|201\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|80\n|align=\"center\"|190\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Fine (sanding bare wood in preparation for finishing, not suitable for removing varnish or paint from wood, use for cleaning plaster and water stain from wood)\n|align=\"center\"|P100\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|162\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|align=\"center\"|140\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P120\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|125\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|120\n|align=\"center\"|115\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Very Fine (sanding of bare wood)\n|align=\"center\"|P150\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|150\n|align=\"center\"|92\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P180\n|align=\"center\"|180\n|align=\"center\"|82\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P220\n|align=\"center\"|220\n|align=\"center\"|68\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" colspan=4 style=\"background-color: #EFEFAC; font-weight: bold\"|MICROGRITS\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Very Fine (sanding finishes between coats)\n|align=\"center\"|P240\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|58.5\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|240\n|align=\"center\"|53.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P280\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|52.2\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P320\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|46.2\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P360\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|40.5\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Extra fine, start polishing of wood \n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|320\n|align=\"center\"|36.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P400\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|35.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P500\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|30.2\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|360\n|align=\"center\"|28.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P600\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|25.8\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"6\"|Super fine (final sanding of finishes, final sanding of wood)\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|400\n|align=\"center\"|23.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P800\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|21.8\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|500\n|align=\"center\"|20.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P1000\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|18.3\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|600\n|align=\"center\"|16.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P1200\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|15.3\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Ultra fine (final sanding and polishing of thick finishes)\n|align=\"center\"|P1500\n|align=\"center\"|800\n|align=\"center\"|12.6\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P2000\n|align=\"center\"|1000\n|align=\"center\"|10.3\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P2500\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|8.4\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n=== Similar to sandpaper ===\n* [[Emery cloth]]\n* [[Crocus cloth]]\n\n=== Tools used with sandpaper ===\n* [[Sanding block]]\n* [[Sander]]\n* [[Belt sander]]\n\n=== Related processes and tools ===\n* [[Polishing]]\n* [[Grind]]ing\n* [[Grinding machine]]\n* [[Rotary tool]]\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\n* [[Sanding sealer]]\n* [[Emery (mineral)]]\n* [[Particle size (grain size)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Michael Dresdner (1992).

Cheaper sandpapers sometimes use nomenclature such as \"Coarse\", \"Medium\" and \"Fine\", but it is unclear to what standards these names refer.\n\n===Grit size table===\nThe following table, compiled from the references at the bottom, compares the CAMI and \"P\" designations with the average grit size in micrometres (\u00b5m).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Grit size table\n!\n!ISO/FEPA Grit designation\n!CAMI Grit designation\n!Average particle diameter (\u00b5m)\n|-\n| colspan=4 style=\"background-color: #EFEFAC; font-weight: bold\"|MACROGRITS\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"9\"|Extra Coarse (Very fast removal of material, [[hardwood flooring]] initial sanding)\n|align=\"center\"|P12\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1815\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P16\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1324\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P20\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|1000\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P24\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|764\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|24\n|align=\"center\"|708\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P30\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|642\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|30\n|align=\"center\"|632\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|36\n|align=\"center\"|530\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P36\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|538\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"3\"|Coarse (Rapid removal of material)\n|align=\"center\"|P40\n|align=\"center\"|40\n|align=\"center\"|425\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|50\n|align=\"center\"|348\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P50\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|336\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Medium (sanding bare wood in preparation for finishing, for gentle removal of varnish, also used for skateboard grip tape)\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|60\n|align=\"center\"|265\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P60\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|269\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P80\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|201\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|80\n|align=\"center\"|190\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Fine (sanding bare wood in preparation for finishing, not suitable for removing varnish or paint from wood, use for cleaning plaster and water stain from wood)\n|align=\"center\"|P100\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|162\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|align=\"center\"|140\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P120\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|125\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|120\n|align=\"center\"|115\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"4\"|Very Fine (sanding of bare wood)\n|align=\"center\"|P150\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|100\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|150\n|align=\"center\"|92\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P180\n|align=\"center\"|180\n|align=\"center\"|82\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P220\n|align=\"center\"|220\n|align=\"center\"|68\n|-\n| valign=\"top\" colspan=4 style=\"background-color: #EFEFAC; font-weight: bold\"|MICROGRITS\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Very Fine (sanding finishes between coats)\n|align=\"center\"|P240\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|58.5\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|240\n|align=\"center\"|53.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P280\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|52.2\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P320\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|46.2\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P360\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|40.5\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Extra fine, start polishing of wood \n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|320\n|align=\"center\"|36.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P400\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|35.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P500\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|30.2\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|360\n|align=\"center\"|28.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P600\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|25.8\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"6\"|Super fine (final sanding of finishes, final sanding of wood)\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|400\n|align=\"center\"|23.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P800\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|21.8\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|500\n|align=\"center\"|20.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P1000\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|18.3\n|-\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|600\n|align=\"center\"|16.0\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P1200\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|15.3\n|-\n| width=\"34%\" valign=\"top\" rowspan=\"5\"|Ultra fine (final sanding and polishing of thick finishes)\n|align=\"center\"|P1500\n|align=\"center\"|800\n|align=\"center\"|12.6\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P2000\n|align=\"center\"|1000\n|align=\"center\"|10.3\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|P2500\n|&nbsp;\n|align=\"center\"|8.4\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n=== Similar to sandpaper ===\n* [[Emery cloth]]\n* [[Crocus cloth]]\n\n=== Tools used with sandpaper ===\n* [[Sanding block]]\n* [[Sander]]\n* [[Belt sander]]\n\n=== Related processes and tools ===\n* [[Polishing]]\n* [[Grind]]ing\n* [[Grinding machine]]\n* [[Rotary tool]]\n\n=== Miscellaneous ===\n* [[Sanding sealer]]\n* [[Emery (mineral)]]\n* [[Particle size (grain size)]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Michael Dresdner (1992).
