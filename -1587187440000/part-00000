Situated at around 3400 feet above sea level, Illickal Kallu is a major tourist attraction in Moonnilavu and Thalanadu village of [[Meenachil]] taluk. Only one half of the original rock remains, as the other half of the rock has fallen off. The nearest town is [[Teekoy]].

Each of the hills has a peculiar shape. One of them resembles a mushroom, which is why it is known as Kuda Kallu (umbrella-shaped rock). The second hill has a small hunch on the sides and is therefore referred to as Koonu Kallu (hunch back rock). There is a {{frac|1|2}}-foot-wide bridge called Narakapalam (bridge to hell) connecting these two hills. The beauty and the landscape of illikkal kallu is similar to that of the pillar rocks in [[Kodaikanal]]. It is said that the mythical medicinal herb Neela Koduveli grows here.

It originally aired on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from 24 March 1984 to 8 April 1988 and was hosted by [[Leslie Crowther]]. The show later briefly moved to [[Sky 1|Sky One]] for one series as ''The New Price is Right'' from 4 September 1989 to 31 August 1990 with [[Bob Warman]] as the host.\n\nIt returned to ITV, as ''Bruce's Price is Right'', from 4 September 1995 to 16 December 2001 with [[Bruce Forsyth]] hosting for seven series, and again on the same channel from 8 May 2006 until 12 January 2007, this time hosted by [[Joe Pasquale]]. Two one-off specials aired as part of ITV's [[Gameshow Marathon (British game show)|''Gameshow Marathon'']] in September 2005 and April 2007.\n\nOn 30 December 2017, it was revived for a one-off pilot hosted by [[Alan Carr]] on [[Channel 4]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/alan-carr-to-host-a-new-pilot-of-the-price-is-right-for-c4|title=Alan Carr to Host a new pilot of the Price is Right for C4|publisher=Channel 4 Press|date=9 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2019, it was announced that ''The Price Is Right'' had been chosen as one of the country's five all-time favourite game shows to be \"supersized and rebooted\" in new series ''Alan Carr's Epic Gameshow'' commissioned by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The 7 part series will be filmed at [[Dock10 (television facility)|dock10 studios]] and broadcast in April 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=ITV orders reboot of five classic gameshows from Talkback |url=http://www.televisual.com/news-detail/ITV-orders-reboot-of-five-classic-gameshows-from-Talkback_nid-7958.html |publisher=Televisual |date=June 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/ITV/status/1241391099333271552?s=09</ref>\n\n==Crowther era (''The Price is Right'')==\n[[File:UK TPIR 1984.png|thumb|Logo from Leslie Crowther-era.]]\n[[Leslie Crowther]] hosted the original UK version, having beaten [[Joe Brown (singer)|Joe Brown]] to the role of host after both recorded pilot episodes. It was also notable for being produced by [[William G. Stewart]] (of later ''[[Fifteen to One]]'' fame), who made the occasional cameo appearance. The Crowther version is popular with fans of the show for its near-campiness, frenetic pace, glamour, and the endearing presentation skills of its host, not for its cheaper prizes (which were forced on it by the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]]'s prize limits). Its format was nearly identical to that of CBS's daytime show in the United States. It initially used the Big Wheel to decide who would go through to the Range Finder (Scoring 100 won \u00a3500 and a bonus spin which awarded an additional \u00a31,000 for spinning 100 or \u00a3250 for landing on an adjacent section), but the IBA forced Central to abandon this because of the lack of pricing skill involved. While the show had to go off air for a while during its first season due to an electricians' strike, the format was adapted to fit into a much more tightly-regulated UK broadcasting environment.\n\nAfter this ruling was made, the show replaced the Big Wheel rounds with a game called \"Supermarket\", a game loosely based on the American version's \"Grocery Game\" pricing game. In \"Supermarket\", each of the three people would select up to four of six presented grocery products; the one whose total was closest to \u00a320, above or below, advanced to the Range Finder.\n\nSeries two saw the Big Wheel return for a spin-off to see who would have the option of bidding or passing on the first showcase; each contestant had to take two spins. If a person scored 100, \u00a3400 would be donated to charity on their behalf, and Leslie would ask the person a consumer-related question to win \u00a3100 for him/herself. The winner was the contestant who came closer to 100 in either direction.\n\nThe Crowther version later replaced Supermarket and the Big Wheel called with the \"Showcase Showdown\", where all six on-stage contestants played a series of estimated-guess questions and the person farthest away from the actual prize was eliminated. This was done until the last two contestants were left, and they then advanced to the Range Finder.\n\nThe final round, the Range Finder, was played largely the same way as on the Showcase finale on the American version. In the first season, the winner would not win the largest prize in their showcase if their winning guess was not within 10% of the showcase total.  In subsequent seasons, the game was played with 1972\u201374 United States rules (no Double Showcase rule), while it did use the rule for a double overbid.\n\n===Pricing Games===\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*3 in a Row (not based on any US game.)\n*3 Strikes\n*Any Number\n*Bargain Bar (\"Barker's Bargain Bar\" in the US.)\n*Blank Cheque (Now known as \"Check Game\" in the US.)\n*Bonus Game\n*(The) Card Game\n*Check-Out\n*Cliffhanger (\"Cliff Hangers\" in the US.)\n*(The) Clock Game\n*Danger Price\n*Dice Game\n*Escalator (\"Walk of Fame\" in the US.)\n*Five Price Tags\n*Give or Keep?\n*Hi Lo (played with small prizes instead of grocery items.)\n*Hole in One\n*Lucky 7 (played with seven \u00a31 coins for a prize with a three-digit price.)\n*Master Key\n*Matchmaker (not based on any US game; a pricing game in name only, as it actually involved no prices at all.)\n*Money Game (played for a vehicle with a three-digit price.)\n*Most Expensive (an original game later introduced in the US as \"Easy as 1, 2, 3\"; ''not'' the US' \"Most Expensive\"; contestants only won the most expensive prize.)\n*One Away\n*Partners (loosely based on Double Bullseye.)\n*The Penny Drops (\"Penny Ante\" in the US.)\n*Permutation (not based on any US game; played much like Balance Game II.)\n*Pick-a-Pair (played with small prizes instead of grocery items.)\n*Punch a Bunch\n*Race Game\n*Range Game\n*Safecracker (\"Safe Crackers\" in the US.)\n*Secret X (contestant has three chances to win up to two X's in addition to the one given at the outset.)\n*Side by Side (not based on any US game; not related to the US' Side by Side in any way.)\n*Squeeze Play (played for a three-digit prize; players remove two numbers instead of one from a set of five digits or one number from a set of four.)\n*Switcheroo (played for four two-digit prizes and one three-digit prize.)\n*Take Two\n*Temptation\n*Ten Chances (played for two two-digit prizes and one three-digit prize.)\n*Tic-Tac-Toe (a variation on Secret X.)\n*Time-Play (a variation on Clock Game; played for three three-digit prizes in ascending order of price.)\n*Trade Up (\"Trader Bob\" in the US.)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Announcer===\n*[[Simon Prebble]] (1984\u20131988)\n\n===Models===\n*Marie-Elise Grepne (1984\u20131985)\n*Jacqueline Bucknell (1984\u20131986)\n*[[Julia Roberts (QVC presenter)|Julia Roberts]] (1984\u20131986)\n*Denise Kelly (1984\u20131988)\n*Sandra Easby (1985)\n*Cindy Day (1986\u20131988)\n*Carol Greenwood (1986\u20131988)\n*Gillian de Terville (1986\u20131988)\n*Elsa O'Toole (1986)\n*Judy Bailey (1986\u20131988)\n*Laura Calland (1987\u20131988)\n*Sarah Wynter (1988)\n\n==Warman era (''The New Price is Right'')==\n[[File:TheNewPriceIsRight.png|thumb|Logo from Bob Warman-era.]]\nThe second version hosted by [[Bob Warman]] is considered to be a precursor to the third version hosted by [[Bruce Forsyth]], as it was a half-hour and used the Showcase range game. Having premiered shortly after Leslie Crowther's version went off the air, it retained many elements from the set and props, but was somewhat \"Americanized\". The show was hence called \"'''''The New Price is Right'''''\" and had a red, yellow and green pound sign. The Warman version also had slightly better and more expensive prizes than the Crowther version due to the program's shorter length, in-show sponsorship, and lighter government regulation of satellite television channels. The show also had a light border in the opening (mimicking the American version), used US music (including the opening theme, the ''[[Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour]]'' theme and ''[[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]]'' car cues, to name a few), and had more colour on the set.\n\nThe Showcase round was played considerably differently: After three games and a single Showcase Showdown at the Big Wheel (in which spinning 100 earned a bonus spin worth a bonus prize), the Showdown winner selected a range at random from \u00a3250 to \u00a31,000; if the bid was within the selected range of the price of the presented showcase without going over, they won the Showcase.\n\n===Pricing Games===\n*Bargain Bar\n*Cliffhanger\n*Danger Price\n*Five Price Tags (played with grocery items, and players are given a free pick at the start.)\n*Hi Lo\n*Lucky 7 (played with seven tokens.)\n*Money Game (played for a car, as in America.)\n*Pick-a-Pair (played with grocery items.)\n*Race Game\n*Side by Side (not based on any American pricing game, including \"Side by Side\".)\n*Switcheroo\n*Ten Chances\n\n===Announcers===\n*Bobby Bragg\n*Al Sherwin\n\n===Models===\n*Suzie Marlowe\n*Tracie Williams\n*Katrina Maltby\n*Julie Broster\n*Peitra Caston\n\n==Forsyth era (''Bruce's Price is Right'')==\n[[File:Bruce's Price Is Right.png|thumb|Logo for the Bruce Forsyth-era.]]\nWhen it started in 1995, '''''Bruce's Price is Right''''' was one of the first shows to fully take advantage of the [[Independent Television Commission]]'s lifting of the prize limits and the general deregulation of the UK broadcasting environment. The Showcase Showdown was played on the Big Wheel (objections to lack of skill no longer being a factor), with the highest-scoring contestant on one spin or a combination of two spins going through to the Range Finder, and any contestant who scored 100 on one spin or a combination of two spins would win \u00a31,000. The ranges for the Range Finder in this version went from \u00a31,000 to \u00a35,000. (Unlike the other three versions, this version did not involve any bonus spin.)\n\nAlthough, it was only in a half-hour format with three pricing games per show (the Crowther show had been an hour long with six games), it still gave away more valuable prizes each week than the previous ITV version had done (for example, it was possible for a contestant to win two cars, one in a pricing game and one in the showcase, which would have been utterly unthinkable on British TV in the 1980s). Cars offered were usually [[supermini]]s, from makers like [[Daihatsu]] and [[Daewoo]], or models like a [[Ford Ka]] or [[Mazda Demio]], but small sports cars like a [[Hyundai Accent]] or [[Vauxhall Tigra]] were offered on occasion.\n\nOn the Forsyth version, the game [[Plinko]] was played to very different rules from the US version; considerably less money could be won, and contestants could risk their cash winnings on one final Plinko chip in hopes of adding a car or other large prize to their winnings (the cash spaces on the board were replaced with alternating \"WIN\" and \"LOSE\" tags).  Landing on \"LOSE\" would lose all the money accumulated, while landing on \"WIN\" won the car or other large prize plus the money. (''[[Ant and Dec's Gameshow Marathon]]'' used these rules for their playing of Plinko, with an extra choice of a pound sign in addition to \"WIN\" and \"LOSE\", so that landing in the pound sign slot would double the winnings.  [[Vernon Kay]]'s extra chip, however, landed in a \"WIN\" slot.)\n\nMany European versions of the show that debuted after the Forsyth version based their games and sound cues on that show. The main theme, an update of the US theme, and the \"come on down\" music are from the short-lived [[The New Price Is Right (1994 game show)|1994 US syndicated version]].\n\nForsyth initially opened this version with a modified version of his trademark line of \"Nice to see you, to see you...NICE!\" (where the audience yells the word \"nice\" at the end) adding \"...and it's nice to meet the stars of our show, whoever you are!\" In later series the original line was used, followed by \"Let's meet the stars of our show, whoever you are!\"\n\n===Pricing Games===\n'''Introduced Series 1 (1995)'''\n*Cliffhanger (\"Cliff Hangers\" in the US; contestants were told that the prices increased as the game progressed.)\n*Clock Game (rules modified after Series 1 so that all prizes ended in either '0' or '5'.)\n*Danger Price (contestant could not win the prize that cost the danger price.)\n*Double Price Tags (\"Double Prices\" in the US.)\n*Hole in One (played with four small prizes instead of six grocery products, uses two-putt rule.)\n*Master Key\n*Money Game\n*Most Expensive (contestant only won the most expensive prize.)\n*One Right Price (regularly played for two cars, though the contestant could only choose one.)\n*Pathfinder\n*Pick-a-Pair (played with the prizes themselves instead of with grocery products.)\n*Plinko\n*Race Game (played with a 30-second timer.)\n*Secret \"X\" (except on earliest playings, contestants had three chances to win the two additional Xs.)\n*Swap (\"Switch?\" in the US; contestant could only win one prize they would choose.)\n*Switcheroo (a non-car game)\n\n'''Introduced Series 2 (1996)'''\n*Check-Out\n*Lucky Seven (modified so that no numbers appeared in the price more than once.)\n*Make Your Move\n*Pick-a-Number\n\n'''Introduced Series 3 (1997)'''\n*Credit Card (contestant won the three prizes they picked, and only one prize can create a loss and may still win the game; rules modified later on so that they also kept the remaining money on the card)\n*Most Expensive (replaced original \"Most Expensive\" from Series 1; now a renamed version of \"Easy as 1, 2, 3\".)\n*Split Decision (used the game's timed format.)\n*Three Strikes ('one strike in the bag' rule implemented from Series 5 onward.)\n\n'''Introduced Series 4 (1998)'''\n*Any Number\n*Bruce's Bargain Bar (\"Barker's Bargain Bar\" in the US, contestant only won one of the prizes.)\n*Hi Lo (played for two prizes, contestants chose one prize if game was won.)\n\n'''Introduced Series 5 (1999)'''\n*Joker\n*Side by Side\n*Price Tags (\"Barker's Markers\"/\"Make Your Mark\" in the US)\n\n'''Introduced Series 6 (2000)'''\n*Clearance Sale\n*Let 'em Roll (except on earliest playings, the number of rolls was determined using a grocery product and three price choices.)\n*Push Over (the blocks went \"to Australia\" according to Bruce.)\n\n'''Introduced Series 7 (2001)'''\n*No new games were introduced.\n\n===Announcer===\n*[[Peter Dickson (announcer)|Peter Dickson]] (1995\u20132001)\n\n===Models===\n*Kimberley Cowell (1995\u20132001)\n*[[Emma Noble]] (1995\u20131998)\n*Emma Steadman (1995\u20132001)\n*[[Brian Tattersall]] (1995\u20131998)\n*Simon Peat (1998\u20132001)\n*Lea Kristensen (1998\u20132001)\n\n==Ant and Dec's Gameshow Marathon (''The Price is Right'')==\nOn 17 September 2005, as part of a celebration of the 50th birthday of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], [[Ant & Dec]] hosted a one-off revival of ''The Price is Right'' as part of ''[[Gameshow Marathon (British game show)|Ant & Dec's Gameshow Marathon]]''; they also hosted revivals of several other game shows that were once popular on the ITV network.

It followed the same gameplay format as Bob Warman and Bruce Forsyth's versions, with Range Finder ranges going from \u00a3500 to \u00a33000 (sometimes \u00a34000), and the Showcase Showdown adapted the bonus spin from the Warman version, with a car at stake; later replaced by the \u00a31000 bonus. It had a very \"[[Pantomime|panto]]\" feel to it, and it relies on nostalgia of the Crowther version, which was known for its cheap prizes because of the regulations of the time. Joe's tour manager, Ray Tizzard, made appearances as his \"twin\" in various pricing games.\n\nThe show expanded to an hour from 3 July 2006. This involved three games being played, a Showcase Showdown, three more games, another Showcase Showdown, and then, the winners from both showdowns take part in the 'Pasquale Finale', a spin-off on the wheel to see who will go through to the Range Finder. In addition, prior to this, the maximum range in the Range Finder increased to \u00a34000, as the budget increased.\n\nAfter the first three games and Showcase Showdown, Contestants' Row was cleared of people, and a new set of four contestants was called down.\n\nIn all versions of the programme, a perfect bid in Contestants' Row resulted in a \u00a3100 bonus in either cash or, in the Warman version, gift certificates.\n\n===Pricing Games===\n*Any Number\n*Cliffhanger (\"Cliff Hangers\" in the US.)\n*Danger Price\n*Deck of Cards (\"Card Game\" in the US; introduced when the show went hour-long.)\n*Easy as 1, 2, 3\n*Find the Lady (\"Shell Game\" in the US, played here with playing cards, including a Queen.)\n*Half & Half (\"Money Game\" in the US.)\n*Hi Lo\n*Hole in One\n*Joe's Bargain Bar (\"Barker's Bargain Bar\" in the US.)\n*Joe's Lucky Bag (\"3 Strikes\" in the US.)\n*Joe Ker (introduced when the show went hour-long; known as \"Joker\" in the US.)\n*Lucky 7 (\"Lucky Seven\" in the US; introduced when the show went hour-long, follows the same rules as Bruce Forsyth's version.)\n*On the Nose\n*One Right Price (''not'' the US' 1 Right Price; actually more similar to the US' Double Prices, with three choices, so you could call it \"Triple Prices\".)\n*One Wrong Price\n*Pick a Number\n*Pick-a-Pair (played with only four items.)\n*Plinko\n*Price Tags (\"Five Price Tags\" in the US; introduced when the show went hour-long.)\n*Push Over\n*Safecracker (\"Safe Crackers\" in the US.)\n*Side by Side\n*Swap (\"Switch?\" in the US.)\n*Take 2\n*Walk the Line (the grocery portion of Let 'em Roll with five items; based on the high-low game on ''[[Play Your Cards Right]]'' with prices of grocery items instead of playing cards; to win, a contestant must correctly run the board with no mistakes.)\n\n===Announcers===\n*Peter Dickson (2006\u20132007)\n*Mike Hurley (2006\u20132007) (occasional cover for Peter Dickson)\n\n===Models===\n*[[Natalie Denning]] (2006\u20132007)\n*[[Amanda Robbins]] (2006\u20132007)\n*[[Richard Kyte]] (2006\u20132007)\n*[[Natalie Pike]] (2006\u20132007)\n\n===Cancellation===\nITV chiefs cancelled ''The Price is Right'' at the end of its latest run on 12 January 2007, citing the fact that while ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]'' on [[Channel 4]] regularly attracted over 2.5&nbsp;million viewers, Pasquale only managed to pull in 800,000.\n\n==Vernon Kay's Gameshow Marathon (''The Price is Right'')==\nAfter the success of ''[[Gameshow Marathon (British game show)|Ant & Dec's Gameshow Marathon]]'' in 2005, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] brought the show back, this time hosted by Vernon Kay, a contestant in the first series.

Scoring exactly 100 on the wheel won \u00a3100.

However, unlike ''GSM'' this would feature only civilian contestants hoping to win either a big cash reward or top of the range prizes instead of celebrities playing for their favorite charities along with a viewer at home.\n\nAccording to the press release, Carr said ''\"It is such a privilege for me to be involved in these truly iconic shows that have brought so much joy to my childhood.

It originally aired on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] from 24 March 1984 to 8 April 1988 and was hosted by [[Leslie Crowther]]. The show later briefly moved to [[Sky 1|Sky One]] for one series as ''The New Price is Right'' from 4 September 1989 to 31 August 1990 with [[Bob Warman]] as the host.\n\nIt returned to ITV, as ''Bruce's Price is Right'', from 4 September 1995 to 16 December 2001 with [[Bruce Forsyth]] hosting for seven series, and again on the same channel from 8 May 2006 until 12 January 2007, this time hosted by [[Joe Pasquale]]. Two one-off specials aired as part of ITV's [[Gameshow Marathon (British game show)|''Gameshow Marathon'']] in September 2005 and April 2007.\n\nOn 30 December 2017, it was revived for a one-off pilot hosted by [[Alan Carr]] on [[Channel 4]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channel4.com/info/press/news/alan-carr-to-host-a-new-pilot-of-the-price-is-right-for-c4|title=Alan Carr to Host a new pilot of the Price is Right for C4|publisher=Channel 4 Press|date=9 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2019, it was announced that ''The Price Is Right'' had been chosen as one of the country's five all-time favourite game shows to be \"supersized and rebooted\" in new series ''Alan Carr's Epic Gameshow'' commissioned by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]. The 7 part series will be filmed at [[Dock10 (television facility)|dock10 studios]] and broadcast in April 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=ITV orders reboot of five classic gameshows from Talkback |url=http://www.televisual.com/news-detail/ITV-orders-reboot-of-five-classic-gameshows-from-Talkback_nid-7958.html |publisher=Televisual |date=June 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>https://twitter.com/ITV/status/1241391099333271552?s=09</ref>\n\n==Crowther era (''The Price is Right'')==\n[[File:UK TPIR 1984.png|thumb|Logo from Leslie Crowther-era.]]\n[[Leslie Crowther]] hosted the original UK version, having beaten [[Joe Brown (singer)|Joe Brown]] to the role of host after both recorded pilot episodes. It was also notable for being produced by [[William G. Stewart]] (of later ''[[Fifteen to One]]'' fame), who made the occasional cameo appearance. The Crowther version is popular with fans of the show for its near-campiness, frenetic pace, glamour, and the endearing presentation skills of its host, not for its cheaper prizes (which were forced on it by the [[Independent Broadcasting Authority]]'s prize limits). Its format was nearly identical to that of CBS's daytime show in the United States. It initially used the Big Wheel to decide who would go through to the Range Finder (Scoring 100 won \u00a3500 and a bonus spin which awarded an additional \u00a31,000 for spinning 100 or \u00a3250 for landing on an adjacent section), but the IBA forced Central to abandon this because of the lack of pricing skill involved. While the show had to go off air for a while during its first season due to an electricians' strike, the format was adapted to fit into a much more tightly-regulated UK broadcasting environment.\n\nAfter this ruling was made, the show replaced the Big Wheel rounds with a game called \"Supermarket\", a game loosely based on the American version's \"Grocery Game\" pricing game. In \"Supermarket\", each of the three people would select up to four of six presented grocery products; the one whose total was closest to \u00a320, above or below, advanced to the Range Finder.\n\nSeries two saw the Big Wheel return for a spin-off to see who would have the option of bidding or passing on the first showcase; each contestant had to take two spins. If a person scored 100, \u00a3400 would be donated to charity on their behalf, and Leslie would ask the person a consumer-related question to win \u00a3100 for him/herself. The winner was the contestant who came closer to 100 in either direction.\n\nThe Crowther version later replaced Supermarket and the Big Wheel called with the \"Showcase Showdown\", where all six on-stage contestants played a series of estimated-guess questions and the person farthest away from the actual prize was eliminated. This was done until the last two contestants were left, and they then advanced to the Range Finder.\n\nThe final round, the Range Finder, was played largely the same way as on the Showcase finale on the American version. In the first season, the winner would not win the largest prize in their showcase if their winning guess was not within 10% of the showcase total.  In subsequent seasons, the game was played with 1972\u201374 United States rules (no Double Showcase rule), while it did use the rule for a double overbid.\n\n===Pricing Games===\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*3 in a Row (not based on any US game.)\n*3 Strikes\n*Any Number\n*Bargain Bar (\"Barker's Bargain Bar\" in the US.)\n*Blank Cheque (Now known as \"Check Game\" in the US.)\n*Bonus Game\n*(The) Card Game\n*Check-Out\n*Cliffhanger (\"Cliff Hangers\" in the US.)\n*(The) Clock Game\n*Danger Price\n*Dice Game\n*Escalator (\"Walk of Fame\" in the US.)\n*Five Price Tags\n*Give or Keep?\n*Hi Lo (played with small prizes instead of grocery items.)\n*Hole in One\n*Lucky 7 (played with seven \u00a31 coins for a prize with a three-digit price.)\n*Master Key\n*Matchmaker (not based on any US game; a pricing game in name only, as it actually involved no prices at all.)\n*Money Game (played for a vehicle with a three-digit price.)\n*Most Expensive (an original game later introduced in the US as \"Easy as 1, 2, 3\"; ''not'' the US' \"Most Expensive\"; contestants only won the most expensive prize.)\n*One Away\n*Partners (loosely based on Double Bullseye.)\n*The Penny Drops (\"Penny Ante\" in the US.)\n*Permutation (not based on any US game; played much like Balance Game II.)\n*Pick-a-Pair (played with small prizes instead of grocery items.)\n*Punch a Bunch\n*Race Game\n*Range Game\n*Safecracker (\"Safe Crackers\" in the US.)\n*Secret X (contestant has three chances to win up to two X's in addition to the one given at the outset.)\n*Side by Side (not based on any US game; not related to the US' Side by Side in any way.)\n*Squeeze Play (played for a three-digit prize; players remove two numbers instead of one from a set of five digits or one number from a set of four.)\n*Switcheroo (played for four two-digit prizes and one three-digit prize.)\n*Take Two\n*Temptation\n*Ten Chances (played for two two-digit prizes and one three-digit prize.)\n*Tic-Tac-Toe (a variation on Secret X.)\n*Time-Play (a variation on Clock Game; played for three three-digit prizes in ascending order of price.)\n*Trade Up (\"Trader Bob\" in the US.)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Announcer===\n*[[Simon Prebble]] (1984\u20131988)\n\n===Models===\n*Marie-Elise Grepne (1984\u20131985)\n*Jacqueline Bucknell (1984\u20131986)\n*[[Julia Roberts (QVC presenter)|Julia Roberts]] (1984\u20131986)\n*Denise Kelly (1984\u20131988)\n*Sandra Easby (1985)\n*Cindy Day (1986\u20131988)\n*Carol Greenwood (1986\u20131988)\n*Gillian de Terville (1986\u20131988)\n*Elsa O'Toole (1986)\n*Judy Bailey (1986\u20131988)\n*Laura Calland (1987\u20131988)\n*Sarah Wynter (1988)\n\n==Warman era (''The New Price is Right'')==\n[[File:TheNewPriceIsRight.png|thumb|Logo from Bob Warman-era.]]\nThe second version hosted by [[Bob Warman]] is considered to be a precursor to the third version hosted by [[Bruce Forsyth]], as it was a half-hour and used the Showcase range game. Having premiered shortly after Leslie Crowther's version went off the air, it retained many elements from the set and props, but was somewhat \"Americanized\". The show was hence called \"'''''The New Price is Right'''''\" and had a red, yellow and green pound sign. The Warman version also had slightly better and more expensive prizes than the Crowther version due to the program's shorter length, in-show sponsorship, and lighter government regulation of satellite television channels. The show also had a light border in the opening (mimicking the American version), used US music (including the opening theme, the ''[[Match Game-Hollywood Squares Hour]]'' theme and ''[[Concentration (game show)|Concentration]]'' car cues, to name a few), and had more colour on the set.\n\nThe Showcase round was played considerably differently: After three games and a single Showcase Showdown at the Big Wheel (in which spinning 100 earned a bonus spin worth a bonus prize), the Showdown winner selected a range at random from \u00a3250 to \u00a31,000; if the bid was within the selected range of the price of the presented showcase without going over, they won the Showcase.\n\n===Pricing Games===\n*Bargain Bar\n*Cliffhanger\n*Danger Price\n*Five Price Tags (played with grocery items, and players are given a free pick at the start.)\n*Hi Lo\n*Lucky 7 (played with seven tokens.)\n*Money Game (played for a car, as in America.)\n*Pick-a-Pair (played with grocery items.)\n*Race Game\n*Side by Side (not based on any American pricing game, including \"Side by Side\".)\n*Switcheroo\n*Ten Chances\n\n===Announcers===\n*Bobby Bragg\n*Al Sherwin\n\n===Models===\n*Suzie Marlowe\n*Tracie Williams\n*Katrina Maltby\n*Julie Broster\n*Peitra Caston\n\n==Forsyth era (''Bruce's Price is Right'')==\n[[File:Bruce's Price Is Right.png|thumb|Logo for the Bruce Forsyth-era.]]\nWhen it started in 1995, '''''Bruce's Price is Right''''' was one of the first shows to fully take advantage of the [[Independent Television Commission]]'s lifting of the prize limits and the general deregulation of the UK broadcasting environment. The Showcase Showdown was played on the Big Wheel (objections to lack of skill no longer being a factor), with the highest-scoring contestant on one spin or a combination of two spins going through to the Range Finder, and any contestant who scored 100 on one spin or a combination of two spins would win \u00a31,000. The ranges for the Range Finder in this version went from \u00a31,000 to \u00a35,000. (Unlike the other three versions, this version did not involve any bonus spin.)\n\nAlthough, it was only in a half-hour format with three pricing games per show (the Crowther show had been an hour long with six games), it still gave away more valuable prizes each week than the previous ITV version had done (for example, it was possible for a contestant to win two cars, one in a pricing game and one in the showcase, which would have been utterly unthinkable on British TV in the 1980s). Cars offered were usually [[supermini]]s, from makers like [[Daihatsu]] and [[Daewoo]], or models like a [[Ford Ka]] or [[Mazda Demio]], but small sports cars like a [[Hyundai Accent]] or [[Vauxhall Tigra]] were offered on occasion.\n\nOn the Forsyth version, the game [[Plinko]] was played to very different rules from the US version; considerably less money could be won, and contestants could risk their cash winnings on one final Plinko chip in hopes of adding a car or other large prize to their winnings (the cash spaces on the board were replaced with alternating \"WIN\" and \"LOSE\" tags).  Landing on \"LOSE\" would lose all the money accumulated, while landing on \"WIN\" won the car or other large prize plus the money. (''[[Ant and Dec's Gameshow Marathon]]'' used these rules for their playing of Plinko, with an extra choice of a pound sign in addition to \"WIN\" and \"LOSE\", so that landing in the pound sign slot would double the winnings.  [[Vernon Kay]]'s extra chip, however, landed in a \"WIN\" slot.)\n\nMany European versions of the show that debuted after the Forsyth version based their games and sound cues on that show. The main theme, an update of the US theme, and the \"come on down\" music are from the short-lived [[The New Price Is Right (1994 game show)|1994 US syndicated version]].\n\nForsyth initially opened this version with a modified version of his trademark line of \"Nice to see you, to see you...NICE!\" (where the audience yells the word \"nice\" at the end) adding \"...and it's nice to meet the stars of our show, whoever you are!\" In later series the original line was used, followed by \"Let's meet the stars of our show, whoever you are!\"\n\n===Pricing Games===\n'''Introduced Series 1 (1995)'''\n*Cliffhanger (\"Cliff Hangers\" in the US; contestants were told that the prices increased as the game progressed.)\n*Clock Game (rules modified after Series 1 so that all prizes ended in either '0' or '5'.)\n*Danger Price (contestant could not win the prize that cost the danger price.)\n*Double Price Tags (\"Double Prices\" in the US.)\n*Hole in One (played with four small prizes instead of six grocery products, uses two-putt rule.)\n*Master Key\n*Money Game\n*Most Expensive (contestant only won the most expensive prize.)\n*One Right Price (regularly played for two cars, though the contestant could only choose one.)\n*Pathfinder\n*Pick-a-Pair (played with the prizes themselves instead of with grocery products.)\n*Plinko\n*Race Game (played with a 30-second timer.)\n*Secret \"X\" (except on earliest playings, contestants had three chances to win the two additional Xs.)\n*Swap (\"Switch?\" in the US; contestant could only win one prize they would choose.)\n*Switcheroo (a non-car game)\n\n'''Introduced Series 2 (1996)'''\n*Check-Out\n*Lucky Seven (modified so that no numbers appeared in the price more than once.)\n*Make Your Move\n*Pick-a-Number\n\n'''Introduced Series 3 (1997)'''\n*Credit Card (contestant won the three prizes they picked, and only one prize can create a loss and may still win the game; rules modified later on so that they also kept the remaining money on the card)\n*Most Expensive (replaced original \"Most Expensive\" from Series 1; now a renamed version of \"Easy as 1, 2, 3\".)\n*Split Decision (used the game's timed format.)\n*Three Strikes ('one strike in the bag' rule implemented from Series 5 onward.)\n\n'''Introduced Series 4 (1998)'''\n*Any Number\n*Bruce's Bargain Bar (\"Barker's Bargain Bar\" in the US, contestant only won one of the prizes.)\n*Hi Lo (played for two prizes, contestants chose one prize if game was won.)\n\n'''Introduced Series 5 (1999)'''\n*Joker\n*Side by Side\n*Price Tags (\"Barker's Markers\"/\"Make Your Mark\" in the US)\n\n'''Introduced Series 6 (2000)'''\n*Clearance Sale\n*Let 'em Roll (except on earliest playings, the number of rolls was determined using a grocery product and three price choices.)\n*Push Over (the blocks went \"to Australia\" according to Bruce.)\n\n'''Introduced Series 7 (2001)'''\n*No new games were introduced.\n\n===Announcer===\n*[[Peter Dickson (announcer)|Peter Dickson]] (1995\u20132001)\n\n===Models===\n*Kimberley Cowell (1995\u20132001)\n*[[Emma Noble]] (1995\u20131998)\n*Emma Steadman (1995\u20132001)\n*Brian Tattersall (1995\u20131998)\n*Simon Peat (1998\u20132001)\n*Lea Kristensen (1998\u20132001)\n\n==Ant and Dec's Gameshow Marathon (''The Price is Right'')==\nOn 17 September 2005, as part of a celebration of the 50th birthday of [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], [[Ant & Dec]] hosted a one-off revival of ''The Price is Right'' as part of ''[[Gameshow Marathon (British game show)|Ant & Dec's Gameshow Marathon]]''; they also hosted revivals of several other game shows that were once popular on the ITV network.

It followed the same gameplay format as Bob Warman and Bruce Forsyth's versions, with Range Finder ranges going from \u00a3500 to \u00a33000 (sometimes \u00a34000), and the Showcase Showdown adapted the bonus spin from the Warman version, with a car at stake; later replaced by the \u00a31000 bonus. It had a very \"[[Pantomime|panto]]\" feel to it, and it relies on nostalgia of the Crowther version, which was known for its cheap prizes because of the regulations of the time. Joe's tour manager, Ray Tizzard, made appearances as his \"twin\" in various pricing games.\n\nThe show expanded to an hour from 3 July 2006. This involved three games being played, a Showcase Showdown, three more games, another Showcase Showdown, and then, the winners from both showdowns take part in the 'Pasquale Finale', a spin-off on the wheel to see who will go through to the Range Finder. In addition, prior to this, the maximum range in the Range Finder increased to \u00a34000, as the budget increased.\n\nAfter the first three games and Showcase Showdown, Contestants' Row was cleared of people, and a new set of four contestants was called down.\n\nIn all versions of the programme, a perfect bid in Contestants' Row resulted in a \u00a3100 bonus in either cash or, in the Warman version, gift certificates.\n\n===Pricing Games===\n*Any Number\n*Cliffhanger (\"Cliff Hangers\" in the US.)\n*Danger Price\n*Deck of Cards (\"Card Game\" in the US; introduced when the show went hour-long.)\n*Easy as 1, 2, 3\n*Find the Lady (\"Shell Game\" in the US, played here with playing cards, including a Queen.)\n*Half & Half (\"Money Game\" in the US.)\n*Hi Lo\n*Hole in One\n*Joe's Bargain Bar (\"Barker's Bargain Bar\" in the US.)\n*Joe's Lucky Bag (\"3 Strikes\" in the US.)\n*Joe Ker (introduced when the show went hour-long; known as \"Joker\" in the US.)\n*Lucky 7 (\"Lucky Seven\" in the US; introduced when the show went hour-long, follows the same rules as Bruce Forsyth's version.)\n*On the Nose\n*One Right Price (''not'' the US' 1 Right Price; actually more similar to the US' Double Prices, with three choices, so you could call it \"Triple Prices\".)\n*One Wrong Price\n*Pick a Number\n*Pick-a-Pair (played with only four items.)\n*Plinko\n*Price Tags (\"Five Price Tags\" in the US; introduced when the show went hour-long.)\n*Push Over\n*Safecracker (\"Safe Crackers\" in the US.)\n*Side by Side\n*Swap (\"Switch?\" in the US.)\n*Take 2\n*Walk the Line (the grocery portion of Let 'em Roll with five items; based on the high-low game on ''[[Play Your Cards Right]]'' with prices of grocery items instead of playing cards; to win, a contestant must correctly run the board with no mistakes.)\n\n===Announcers===\n*Peter Dickson (2006\u20132007)\n*Mike Hurley (2006\u20132007) (occasional cover for Peter Dickson)\n\n===Models===\n*[[Natalie Denning]] (2006\u20132007)\n*[[Amanda Robbins]] (2006\u20132007)\n*[[Richard Kyte]] (2006\u20132007)\n*[[Natalie Pike]] (2006\u20132007)\n\n===Cancellation===\nITV chiefs cancelled ''The Price is Right'' at the end of its latest run on 12 January 2007, citing the fact that while ''[[The Paul O'Grady Show]]'' on [[Channel 4]] regularly attracted over 2.5&nbsp;million viewers, Pasquale only managed to pull in 800,000.\n\n==Vernon Kay's Gameshow Marathon (''The Price is Right'')==\nAfter the success of ''[[Gameshow Marathon (British game show)|Ant & Dec's Gameshow Marathon]]'' in 2005, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] brought the show back, this time hosted by Vernon Kay, a contestant in the first series.

However, it has been declined since then.\n\nAfter five pricing games (''Cliffhangers'', ''Plinko'', ''Pay the Rent'', ''Bonkers'' and ''Clock Game''), those five players spun the wheel with the Showcase Showdown winner going through to the Showcase Final which was played exactly the same way as on ''Bruce\u2019s Price Is Right''. Scoring exactly 100 on the wheel won \u00a3100. A tie would be broken via spin-off with no bonus for spinning 100.\n\nAs of now, the series has not either been picked up nor have been aired on the network since then.\n\n===Announcer===\n*Tony Hirst\n\n===Models===\n*Nichola Dixon\n*Dorretta Maynard\n*Zoe Nicholas\n\n==Alan Carr's Epic Gameshow (''The Price is Right'')==\nOn 30 May 2019, ITV has ordered a series called ''Alan Carr's Epic Gameshow''<ref>[https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/itv-commissions-epic-reboot-five-nations-favourite-gameshows-hosted-alan-carr ITV commissions epic reboot of five of the nations favourite, hosted by Alan Carr]</ref>hosted by [[Alan Carr]] and filmed at [[Dock10 (television facility)|dock10 studios]], who has previously hosted a revival of ''The Price is Right'' on [[Channel 4]] in 2017 where like ''[[Gameshow Marathon (British game show)|Gameshow Marathon]]'', it would see five classic game shows being supersized and brought back such as ''[[Play Your Cards Right]]'', ''[[Take Your Pick]]'', ''[[Strike It Lucky|Strike it Lucky]]'', ''[[Bullseye (British game show)|Bullseye]]'' and ''The Price is Right''. However, unlike ''GSM'' this would feature only civilian contestants hoping to win either a big cash reward or top of the range prizes instead of celebrities playing for their favorite charities along with a viewer at home.\n\nAccording to the press release, Carr said ''\"It is such a privilege for me to be involved in these truly iconic shows that have brought so much joy to my childhood.

The founding managing editor of ''People'' was Richard B. \"Dick\" Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at ''Life'' and the journalist who acquired the [[Zapruder film]] of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] for Time Inc. in 1963. ''People''{{'}}s first publisher was Richard J. \"Dick\" Durrell, another Time Inc. veteran.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nStolley characterized the magazine as \"getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html|work=Time|title=The Press: People's Premiere|date=March 14, 1974}}</ref> Stolley's almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine only broke even 18 months after its debut in March 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premier edition for the week ending March 4, 1974, featured actress [[Mia Farrow]], then starring in the film ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', on the cover. That issue also featured stories on [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were Missing In Action.<ref name=\"variety\" /> The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.35|1974|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).\n           \nThe core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from ''Life'' magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of [[ESPN]] anchor [[Trey Wingo]]), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of [[Us Weekly|''Us'' magazine]]) and Robert Emmett Ginna (later a producer of films); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and Ronald B. Scott (later a biographer of Presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]]); former ''Time'' senior editor Richard Burgheim (later the founder of ''Time''{{'}}s ill-fated cable television magazine ''View''); Chief of Photography, a ''Life'' photographer, [[John Loengard]], to be succeeded by John Dominus, a noteworthy ''Life'' staff photographer; and design artist Bernard Waber, author and illustrator of the ''Lyle The Crocodile'' book series for children. Many of the noteworthy ''Life'' photographers contributed to the magazine as well, including legends [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]] and [[Gjon Mili]] and rising stars [[Co Rentmeester]], [[David Burnett (photojournalist)|David Burnett]] and [[Bill Eppridge]]. Other members of the first editorial staff included editors and writers Ross Drake, Ralph Novak, Bina Bernard, James Jerome, Sally Moore, Mary Vespa, Lee Wohlfert, Joy Wansley, Curt Davis, Clare Crawford-Mason,<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/?id=N2tNAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Clare+Crawford-Mason%22+editor+people | title=People's Magazine | journal=Cosmopolitan | year=1980 | volume=188 | pages=206}}</ref> and Jed Horne, later an editor of ''The Times-Picayune'' in New Orleans.\n\nIn 1996, Time Inc. launched a Spanish-language magazine entitled ''[[People en Espa\u00f1ol]]''. The company has said that the new publication emerged after a 1995 issue of the original magazine was distributed with two distinct covers, one featuring the murdered [[Tejano]] singer [[Selena]] and the other featuring the hit television series ''[[Friends]]''; the Selena cover sold out while the other did not.<ref>[http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm \"Grad Named Head of ''People en Espa\u00f1ol''\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050103091825/http://www.tufts.edu/communications/stories/022904PeopleEspanol.htm |date=January 3, 2005 }}.

The founding managing editor of ''People'' was Richard B. \"Dick\" Stolley, a former assistant managing editor at ''Life'' and the journalist who acquired the [[Zapruder film]] of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] for Time Inc. in 1963. ''People''{{'}}s first publisher was Richard J. \"Dick\" Durrell, another Time Inc. veteran.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nStolley characterized the magazine as \"getting back to the people who are causing the news and who are caught up in it, or deserve to be in it. Our focus is on people, not issues.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,944778,00.html|work=Time|title=The Press: People's Premiere|date=March 14, 1974}}</ref> Stolley's almost religious determination to keep the magazine people-focused contributed significantly to its rapid early success. It is said that although Time Inc. pumped an estimated $40 million into the venture, the magazine only broke even 18 months after its debut in March 1974. Initially, the magazine was sold primarily on newsstands and in supermarkets. To get the magazine out each week, founding staff members regularly slept on the floor of their offices two or three nights each week and severely limited all non-essential outside engagements. The premier edition for the week ending March 4, 1974, featured actress [[Mia Farrow]], then starring in the film ''[[The Great Gatsby (1974 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'', on the cover. That issue also featured stories on [[Gloria Vanderbilt]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and the wives of U.S. Vietnam veterans who were Missing In Action.<ref name=\"variety\" /> The magazine was, apart from its cover, printed in black-and-white. The initial cover price was 35 cents ({{Inflation|US|0.35|1974|r=2|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}).\n           \nThe core of the small founding editorial team included other editors, writers, photographers and photo editors from ''Life'' magazine, which had ceased publication just 13 months earlier. This group included managing editor Stolley, senior editors Hal Wingo (father of [[ESPN]] anchor [[Trey Wingo]]), Sam Angeloff (the founding managing editor of [[Us Weekly|''Us'' magazine]]) and Robert Emmett Ginna (later a producer of films); writers James Watters (a theater reviewer) and Ronald B.
