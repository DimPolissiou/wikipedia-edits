Sometimes the runners are referred to as ''harriers''.<ref>[http://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/why-are-runners-often-called-harriers Runners World.] Accessed 9 March 2015.</ref> The course, typically {{convert|4|-|12|km|mi|}} long, may include surfaces of [[grass]], and [[soil|earth]], pass through [[woodland]]s and open country, and include [[hill]]s, flat ground and sometimes gravel road. It is both an [[individual sport|individual]] and a [[team sport]]; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method. Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country, which usually takes place during [[autumn]] and [[winter]], and can include weather conditions of rain, sleet, snow or hail, and a wide range of temperatures.\n\nCross country running is one of the disciplines under the umbrella sport of [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], and is a natural terrain version of [[long-distance running|long-distance]] [[track and field|track]] and [[road running]]. Although open-air running competitions are pre-historic, the rules and traditions of cross country racing emerged in Britain. The English championship became the first national competition in 1876 and the [[International Cross Country Championships]] was held for the first time in 1903. Since 1973 the foremost elite competition has been the [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]].<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/crosscountry/index.html Cross country \u2013 Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227014746/http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/crosscountry/index.html |date=2011-02-27 }}. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved 14 February 2011.</ref>\n\n==Race course==\nCross country courses are laid out on an open or woodland area. The [[IAAF]] recommends that courses be grass-covered, and have rolling terrain with frequent but smooth turns. Courses consist of one or more loops, with a long straight at the start and another leading to the finish line.\n\n===Course design===\nTerrain can vary from open fields to forest hills and even across rivers. It also includes running down and up hills. Because of variations in conditions, international standardization of cross country courses is impossible, and not necessarily desirable. Part of cross country running's appeal is the distinct characteristics of each venue's terrain and weather, as in other outdoor sports like [[motor racing]], [[cycling]] and [[golf]].\n\nAccording to the IAAF, an ideal cross country course has a loop of {{convert|1750|to|2000|m|yd}} laid out on an open or wooded land. It should be covered by grass, as much as possible, and include rolling hills \"with smooth curves and short straights\". While it is perfectly acceptable for local conditions to make dirt or snow the primary surface, courses should minimize running on roads or other macadamized paths. Parks and golf courses often provide suitable locations.\n\nWhile a course may include natural or artificial obstacles, cross country courses support continuous running, and do not require climbing over high barriers, through deep ditches, or fighting through the underbrush, as do military-style [[assault course]]s.<ref name=WorldAthleticsRules>[https://www.worldathletics.org/download/download?filename=1a53ca10-7f30-46e4-83fe-e7ff5fda2c60.pdf&urlslug=C2.1%20-%20Technical%20Rules%20(amended%20on%2031%20January%202020) World Athletics Book of Rules C2.1 - Technical Rules (amended on 31 January 2020)]. [[World Athletics]]. Retrieved 2 February 2020.</ref>\n\nA course at least {{convert|5|m|yd}} full allows competitors to pass others during the race. Clear markings keep competitors from making wrong turns, and spectators from interfering with the competition. Markings may include tape or ribbon on both sides of the course, chalk or paint on the ground, or cones. Some classes use colored flags to indicate directions: red flags for left turns, yellow flags for right turns, and blue flags to continue straight or stay within ten feet of the flag. Courses also commonly include distance markings, usually at each kilometer or each mile.<ref name=USATFRules>[http://www.usatf.org/about/rules/2011/2011rules.pdf USA Track & Field 2011 Competition Rules]. [[USATF]]. Retrieved 27 February 2011.</ref>\n\nThe course should have {{convert|400|to|1200|m|yd|abbr=on}} of level terrain before the first turn, to reduce contact and congestion at the start. However, many courses at smaller competitions have their first turn after a much shorter distance.<ref name=NCAARules>[http://www.ncaapublications.com/productdownloads/TF12.pdf 2011/2012 NCAA Men's and Women's Track & Field and Cross Country Rules]. [[NCAA]]. Retrieved 11 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===Distances===\nCourses for international competitions consist of a loop between 1750 and 2000 meters. Athletes complete three to six loops, depending on the race. Senior men and women compete on a 10 kilometre course. Junior men compete on an 8-kilometre course and junior women compete on a 6-kilometre course.<ref name=\"WorldAthleticsRules\"/>\n\nIn the United States, college men typically compete on {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} courses, while college women race for {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"NCAARules\"/> High school courses are generally {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}}.  Middle school courses are usually {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|2|mi|abbr=on}} long.\n\n===Start===\n[[File:XCgunstart.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The start of a typical cross country race, as an official fires a gun to signal the start]]\nAll runners start at the same time, from a starting [[arc (geometry)|arc]] (or line) marked with lines or boxes for each team or individual. An official, 50 meters or more in front of the starting line, fires a pistol to indicate the start. If runners collide and fall within the first 100 meters, officials can call the runners back and restart the race, however this is done only once. Crossing the line or starting before the starting pistol is fired is considered a false start and most often results in disqualification of the runner.\n\n===Finish===\nThe course ends at a finish line located at the beginning of a ''funnel'' or ''chute'' (a long walkway marked with flags) that keeps athletes single-file in order of finish and facilitates accurate scoring.\n\nDepending on the timing and scoring system, finish officials may collect a small slip from each runner's bib, to keep track of finishing positions. An alternative method (standard in the UK) is to have four officials in two pairs. In the first pair, one official reads out numbers of finishers and the other records them. In the second pair, one official reads out times for the other to record. At the end of the race, the two lists are joined along with information from the entry information. The primary disadvantage of this system is that distractions can easily upset the results, particularly when scores of runners finish close together.\n\n[[Transponder timing|Chip timing]] has grown in popularity to increase accuracy and decrease the number of officials required at the finish line. Each runner attaches a [[transponder]] with [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] to his or her shoe. When the runner crosses the finish line, an electronic pad records the chip number and matches the runner to a database. Chip timing allows officials to use checkpoint mats throughout the race to calculate split times, and to ensure runners cover the entire course. This is by far the most efficient method, although it is also the most expensive. The drawback to chip timing is its inability to separate a close finish properly. Chips times the feet, when the rule books say it is the torso that counts. It is technically possible for an athlete to fall across the finish line, legally crossing the finish line, but with their feet too far away from the sensor to have their finish recorded.\n\nContemporary races have now started to use [[fully automatic timing]] systems for [[photo finish]] accuracy to their results. This has dramatically improved the timing mechanisms of Cross Country over the last few years.\n\n==Scoring==\nScores are determined by summing the top four or five individual finishing places on each team. In international competition, a team typically consists of six runners, with the top four scoring. In the United States, the most common scoring system is seven runners, with the top five scoring. Points are awarded to the individual runners of eligible teams, equal to the position in which they cross the finish line (first place gets 1 point, second place gets 2 points, etc.). The points for these runners are summed, and the lowest score wins. Individual athletes, and athletes from incomplete teams (teams consisting of less than 5 athletes or teams) and individuals who have been disqualified are excluded from scoring. Ties are usually broken by the position of each team's sixth runner.\n\nThe lowest possible score in a five-to-score match is 15 (1+2+3+4+5), achieved by a team's runners finishing in each of the top five positions. If there is a single opposing team then they would have a score of 40 (6+7+8+9+10), which can be considered a \"sweep\" for the winning team. In some competitions a team's sixth and seventh runner are scored in the overall field and are known as \"pushers\" or \"displacers\" as their place can count ahead of other runners, giving other teams more points. In the above match, if there are two non-scoring runners and they came 6th and 7th overall, the opponent's score would be 50 (8+9+10+11+12). Accordingly, the official score of a forfeited dual meet is 15\u201350.\n\n==Strategy==\nBecause of differences between courses in running surface, frequency and tightness of turns, and amount of up and downhill, cross country [[strategy]] does not necessarily simplify to running a steady pace from start to finish. [[Coach (sport)|Coach]]es and cross country runners debate the relative merits of fast starts to get clear of the field, versus steady pacing to maximize physiological efficiency. Some teams emphasize running in a group in order to provide encouragement to others on the team, while others hold that every individual should run his or her own race. In addition, whether you run ahead 'of the pack' or behind it and pull ahead in the end is important, but can vary according to the runner's individual skill, endurance, and the length of the race. Runners should also account for food intake prior to the race. Most important, however, is the training beforehand.<ref>Groves, Harry. ''Tactics & Strategy''.

Most races are run in shorts and vests or singlets, usually in club or school colours. In particularly cold conditions, long-sleeved shirts and tights can be worn to retain warmth without losing mobility. The most common footwear are [[Cross country running shoe|cross country spikes]], lightweight racing shoes with a rubber sole and five or more metal spikes screwed into the forefoot part of the sole. Spike length depends on race conditions, with a muddy course appropriate for spikes as long as {{convert|25|mm|in}}. If a course has a harder surface, spikes as short as {{convert|6|mm|in}} may be most effective. While spikes are suitable for grassy, muddy, or other slippery conditions, runners may choose to wear [[racing flats]], rubber-soled racing shoes without spikes, if the course includes significant portions of paved surfaces or dirt road.<ref name=NFHSRules>2011 NFHS Track & Field and Cross Country Rules Book. [[National Federation of State High School Associations|NFHS]].</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:2010 European Cross Country Championships.jpg|thumb|Runners at the [[2010 European Cross Country Championships]] in [[Portugal]]]]\nFormal cross country competition traces its history to the 19th century and an English game called \"hare and hounds\" or \"the [[Paper Chase (game)|paper chase]]\". English schools started competing in cross country races in 1837, and established a national championship on December 7, 1867. It was held on [[Wimbledon Common]] in south-west London. It was the first cross country race that was considered \"open\", or could be run by anyone. Its original purpose was to imitate steeplechase for off-season training, and was considered a bit of a joke.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The race was about 3.5 miles long, and went through very boggy and hilly terrain. The course was not well marked, and many competitors got lost.

[[England]] won the first 14 titles, and 43 of 59 until the IAAF took over the competition in [[1973 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1973]]. [[France]] was the next most successful country in the early years, winning 12 championships between 1922 and 1956. [[Belgium]] is the only other country to win at the International Cross Country Championship, capturing titles in 1948, 1957, 1961 and 1963. The English also dominated the individual competition, with an Englishman winning the individual title 35 times, including three wins by [[Jack Holden (athlete)|Jack Holden]] (1933\u20131935).\n\nThe first international cross country championship for women was held in 1931, and thirteen more times through 1972. England won 12 of these early championships, losing only in 1968 and 1969 (to the United States). American [[Doris Brown]] won five consecutive individual titles between 1967 and 1971.\n\nBeginning in [[1973 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1973]], the IAAF began hosting the renamed [[World Cross Country Championships]] each year. In [[1975 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1975]], the [[New Zealand]] men and United States women won, marking the first championships by non-European countries. In [[1981 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1981]] an African nation ([[Ethiopia]]) won the men's race for the first time, and [[1991 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|a decade later]] an African nation ([[Kenya]]) won the women's race for the first time.

In middle school, races are more serious and are divided by grade and gender. In high school, the races are far-reaching and tend to be the main talent pool (especially at the senior level) for university- or national-level runners. At the university level, the sport is administered by [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]].<ref>[http://english.cis-sic.ca/championships/xc/ CIS Cross Country Championships]. [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|CIS]]. Retrieved 27 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe organization of cross country running in the United Kingdom has continued to be mostly devolved to the four national associations: [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]]. The sport is based around the clubs, which usually are mixed cross country and road running clubs. The [[English Cross Country Association]] is part of the [[Amateur Athletic Association]].\n\nCross country running takes place from roughly September until March. Most matches are parts of different cross country leagues, which are organized on an ''ad hoc'' basis. These vary from large, high quality leagues, such as the [[London Metropolitan Cross Country League]], [[Birmingham]] League, [[Hampshire]] League, Essex League and [[Surrey]] League (which is unusual in requiring ten runners to score) to small, local leagues (such as the [[Gloucestershire]] AA league), and individual clubs can (and typically are) member of several leagues.\n\nTypically there will be four or five fixtures a season. Also, there are county championships, area championships (North, South, and Midlands), the national championship (whose location rotates around the three areas), and the Inter-Counties Championship organised by the [[UK Counties Athletics Union]], where runners compete for their counties and not their clubs.\n\nThere can be many additional inter-club matches, particularly among the older clubs. Most league matches are around {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and most championships 12 to 15&nbsp;km (approximately 7\u00bd to 9 miles) long. Most clubs are mixed, though men's and women's races tend to be run separately.\n\nSecondary school-aged students are also to compete at local schools races, with a set number of students qualifying for county level, at which there is a further race to be eligible for the relevant national schools cross country race (e.g. the English Schools Cross Country).\n\nAt university level, there is considerable competition available. University clubs typically compete both locally (via English Athletics) as well as between universities - with larger fixtures organized through [[British Universities & Colleges Sport|BUCS]].\n\nPrimary schools, although more often the juniors, also participate in cross country events and some areas of England have done so since the late 1960s. An example would be schools near [[Ouston, County Durham]] which compete as part of Chester-le-Street & District Primary Cross Country Association.<ref>[http://www.chester-le-streetschools.org.uk/athletics/ Chester-le-street schools] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425141808/http://www.chester-le-streetschools.org.uk/athletics/ |date=2012-04-25 }}.

Beginning in 1979, the [[Foot Locker Cross Country Championships]] have offered a national championship for high school cross country runners. Since 2004, the [[Nike Cross Nationals]] have offered an alternative national championship, focused on teams rather than individuals. A 2008 film, ''The Long Green Line'', documented the success of Joe Newton, cross country coach at [[York Community High School]] in [[Elmhurst, Illinois]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1267833/ The Long Green Line (2008) \u2013 IMDb] [[IMDb]].</ref>\n\nWhile many middle schools (grades 6\u20138) in the U.S. offer cross country as a school sport, youth running clubs dominate in this age group.

Few [[elementary school]]s in the U.S. have school teams, but many running clubs exist for youth runners. Youth running clubs compete in local, regional, and national championships sanctioned by the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] (AAU) or [[USA Track & Field|USATF]].

Sometimes the runners are referred to as ''harriers''.<ref>[http://www.runnersworld.com/running-tips/why-are-runners-often-called-harriers Runners World.] Accessed 9 March 2015.</ref> The course, typically {{convert|4|-|12|km|mi|}} long, may include surfaces of [[grass]], and [[soil|earth]], pass through [[woodland]]s and open country, and include [[hill]]s, flat ground and sometimes gravel road. It is both an [[individual sport|individual]] and a [[team sport]]; runners are judged on individual times and teams by a points-scoring method. Both men and women of all ages compete in cross country, which usually takes place during [[autumn]] and [[winter]], and can include weather conditions of rain, sleet, snow or hail, and a wide range of temperatures.\n\nCross country running is one of the disciplines under the umbrella sport of [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], and is a natural terrain version of [[long-distance running|long-distance]] [[track and field|track]] and [[road running]]. Although open-air running competitions are pre-historic, the rules and traditions of cross country racing emerged in Britain. The English championship became the first national competition in 1876 and the [[International Cross Country Championships]] was held for the first time in 1903. Since 1973 the foremost elite competition has been the [[IAAF World Cross Country Championships]].<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/crosscountry/index.html Cross country \u2013 Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227014746/http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/crosscountry/index.html |date=2011-02-27 }}. [[IAAF]]. Retrieved 14 February 2011.</ref>\n\n==Race course==\nCross country courses are laid out on an open or woodland area. The [[IAAF]] recommends that courses be grass-covered, and have rolling terrain with frequent but smooth turns. Courses consist of one or more loops, with a long straight at the start and another leading to the finish line.\n\n===Course design===\nTerrain can vary from open fields to forest hills and even across rivers. It also includes running down and up hills. Because of variations in conditions, international standardization of cross country courses is impossible, and not necessarily desirable. Part of cross country running's appeal is the distinct characteristics of each venue's terrain and weather, as in other outdoor sports like [[motor racing]], [[cycling]] and [[golf]].\n\nAccording to the IAAF, an ideal cross country course has a loop of {{convert|1750|to|2000|m|yd}} laid out on an open or wooded land. It should be covered by grass, as much as possible, and include rolling hills \"with smooth curves and short straights\". While it is perfectly acceptable for local conditions to make dirt or snow the primary surface, courses should minimize running on roads or other macadamized paths. Parks and golf courses often provide suitable locations.\n\nWhile a course may include natural or artificial obstacles, cross country courses support continuous running, and do not require climbing over high barriers, through deep ditches, or fighting through the underbrush, as do military-style [[assault course]]s.<ref name=WorldAthleticsRules>[https://www.worldathletics.org/download/download?filename=1a53ca10-7f30-46e4-83fe-e7ff5fda2c60.pdf&urlslug=C2.1%20-%20Technical%20Rules%20(amended%20on%2031%20January%202020) World Athletics Book of Rules C2.1 - Technical Rules (amended on 31 January 2020)]. [[World Athletics]]. Retrieved 2 February 2020.</ref>\n\nA course at least {{convert|5|m|yd}} full allows competitors to pass others during the race. Clear markings keep competitors from making wrong turns, and spectators from interfering with the competition. Markings may include tape or ribbon on both sides of the course, chalk or paint on the ground, or cones. Some classes use colored flags to indicate directions: red flags for left turns, yellow flags for right turns, and blue flags to continue straight or stay within ten feet of the flag. Courses also commonly include distance markings, usually at each kilometer or each mile.<ref name=USATFRules>[http://www.usatf.org/about/rules/2011/2011rules.pdf USA Track & Field 2011 Competition Rules].

Athletes complete three to six loops, depending on the race. Senior men and women compete on a 10 kilometre course. Junior men compete on an 8-kilometre course and junior women compete on a 6-kilometre course.<ref name=\"WorldAthleticsRules\"/>\n\nIn the United States, college men typically compete on {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|10|km|abbr=on}} courses, while college women race for {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"NCAARules\"/> High school courses are generally {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}}.  Middle school courses are usually {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} or {{convert|2|mi|abbr=on}} long.\n\n===Start===\n[[File:XCgunstart.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The start of a typical cross country race, as an official fires a gun to signal the start]]\nAll runners start at the same time, from a starting [[arc (geometry)|arc]] (or line) marked with lines or boxes for each team or individual. An official, 50 meters or more in front of the starting line, fires a pistol to indicate the start. If runners collide and fall within the first 100 meters, officials can call the runners back and restart the race, however this is done only once. Crossing the line or starting before the starting pistol is fired is considered a false start and most often results in disqualification of the runner.\n\n===Finish===\nThe course ends at a finish line located at the beginning of a ''funnel'' or ''chute'' (a long walkway marked with flags) that keeps athletes single-file in order of finish and facilitates accurate scoring.\n\nDepending on the timing and scoring system, finish officials may collect a small slip from each runner's bib, to keep track of finishing positions. An alternative method (standard in the UK) is to have four officials in two pairs. In the first pair, one official reads out numbers of finishers and the other records them. In the second pair, one official reads out times for the other to record. At the end of the race, the two lists are joined along with information from the entry information. The primary disadvantage of this system is that distractions can easily upset the results, particularly when scores of runners finish close together.\n\n[[Transponder timing|Chip timing]] has grown in popularity to increase accuracy and decrease the number of officials required at the finish line. Each runner attaches a [[transponder]] with [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] to his or her shoe. When the runner crosses the finish line, an electronic pad records the chip number and matches the runner to a database. Chip timing allows officials to use checkpoint mats throughout the race to calculate split times, and to ensure runners cover the entire course. This is by far the most efficient method, although it is also the most expensive. The drawback to chip timing is its inability to separate a close finish properly. Chips times the feet, when the rule books say it is the torso that counts. It is technically possible for an athlete to fall across the finish line, legally crossing the finish line, but with their feet too far away from the sensor to have their finish recorded.\n\nContemporary races have now started to use [[fully automatic timing]] systems for [[photo finish]] accuracy to their results. This has dramatically improved the timing mechanisms of Cross Country over the last few years.\n\n==Scoring==\nScores are determined by summing the top four or five individual finishing places on each team. In international competition, a team typically consists of six runners, with the top four scoring. In the United States, the most common scoring system is seven runners, with the top five scoring. Points are awarded to the individual runners of eligible teams, equal to the position in which they cross the finish line (first place gets 1 point, second place gets 2 points, etc.). The points for these runners are summed, and the lowest score wins. Individual athletes, and athletes from incomplete teams (teams consisting of less than 5 athletes or teams) and individuals who have been disqualified are excluded from scoring. Ties are usually broken by the position of each team's sixth runner.\n\nThe lowest possible score in a five-to-score match is 15 (1+2+3+4+5), achieved by a team's runners finishing in each of the top five positions. If there is a single opposing team then they would have a score of 40 (6+7+8+9+10), which can be considered a \"sweep\" for the winning team. In some competitions a team's sixth and seventh runner are scored in the overall field and are known as \"pushers\" or \"displacers\" as their place can count ahead of other runners, giving other teams more points. In the above match, if there are two non-scoring runners and they came 6th and 7th overall, the opponent's score would be 50 (8+9+10+11+12). Accordingly, the official score of a forfeited dual meet is 15\u201350.\n\n==Strategy==\nBecause of differences between courses in running surface, frequency and tightness of turns, and amount of up and downhill, cross country [[strategy]] does not necessarily simplify to running a steady pace from start to finish. [[Coach (sport)|Coach]]es and cross country runners debate the relative merits of fast starts to get clear of the field, versus steady pacing to maximize physiological efficiency. Some teams emphasize running in a group in order to provide encouragement to others on the team, while others hold that every individual should run his or her own race. In addition, whether you run ahead 'of the pack' or behind it and pull ahead in the end is important, but can vary according to the runner's individual skill, endurance, and the length of the race. Runners should also account for food intake prior to the race. Most important, however, is the training beforehand.<ref>Groves, Harry. ''Tactics & Strategy''.

Most races are run in shorts and vests or singlets, usually in club or school colours. In particularly cold conditions, long-sleeved shirts and tights can be worn to retain warmth without losing mobility. The most common footwear are [[Cross country running shoe|cross country spikes]], lightweight racing shoes with a rubber sole and five or more metal spikes screwed into the forefoot part of the sole. Spike length depends on race conditions, with a muddy course appropriate for spikes as long as {{convert|25|mm|in}}. If a course has a harder surface, spikes as short as {{convert|6|mm|in}} may be most effective. While spikes are suitable for grassy, muddy, or other slippery conditions, runners may choose to wear [[racing flats]], rubber-soled racing shoes without spikes, if the course includes significant portions of paved surfaces or dirt road.<ref name=NFHSRules>2011 NFHS Track & Field and Cross Country Rules Book.

English schools started competing in cross country races in 1837, and established a national championship on December 7, 1867. It was held on [[Wimbledon Common]] in south-west London. It was the first cross country race that was considered \"open\", or could be run by anyone. Its original purpose was to imitate steeplechase for off-season training, and was considered a bit of a joke.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} The race was about 3.5 miles long, and went through very boggy and hilly terrain. The course was not well marked, and many competitors got lost. Matters were not helped by the fact that the race was run in the dark, as it began at 5 pm.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Burfoot|first=Amby|title=Common Ground|journal=Runners World|date=July 2006|volume=92}}</ref>{{MOS|date=September 2012}}\n\n===Olympic Games===\n{{main|Cross country running at the Olympics}}\n[[File:Ind cross country 1924 Summer Olympics.jpg|300px|thumb|Individual cross country race at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].

[[England]] won the first 14 titles, and 43 of 59 until the IAAF took over the competition in [[1973 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1973]]. [[France]] was the next most successful country in the early years, winning 12 championships between 1922 and 1956. [[Belgium]] is the only other country to win at the International Cross Country Championship, capturing titles in 1948, 1957, 1961 and 1963. The English also dominated the individual competition, with an Englishman winning the individual title 35 times, including three wins by [[Jack Holden (athlete)|Jack Holden]] (1933\u20131935).\n\nThe first international cross country championship for women was held in 1931, and thirteen more times through 1972. England won 12 of these early championships, losing only in 1968 and 1969 (to the United States). American [[Doris Brown]] won five consecutive individual titles between 1967 and 1971.\n\nBeginning in [[1973 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1973]], the IAAF began hosting the renamed [[World Cross Country Championships]] each year. In [[1975 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1975]], the [[New Zealand]] men and United States women won, marking the first championships by non-European countries. In [[1981 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|1981]] an African nation ([[Ethiopia]]) won the men's race for the first time, and [[1991 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|a decade later]] an African nation ([[Kenya]]) won the women's race for the first time. Ethiopia or Kenya has captured every men's title since 1981 and every women's title since [[2001 IAAF World Cross Country Championships|2001]].

In middle school, races are more serious and are divided by grade and gender. In high school, the races are far-reaching and tend to be the main talent pool (especially at the senior level) for university- or national-level runners. At the university level, the sport is administered by [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport]].<ref>[http://english.cis-sic.ca/championships/xc/ CIS Cross Country Championships]. [[Canadian Interuniversity Sport|CIS]]. Retrieved 27 February 2011.</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe organization of cross country running in the United Kingdom has continued to be mostly devolved to the four national associations: [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]]. The sport is based around the clubs, which usually are mixed cross country and road running clubs. The [[English Cross Country Association]] is part of the [[Amateur Athletic Association]].\n\nCross country running takes place from roughly September until March. Most matches are parts of different cross country leagues, which are organized on an ''ad hoc'' basis. These vary from large, high quality leagues, such as the [[London Metropolitan Cross Country League]], [[Birmingham]] League, [[Hampshire]] League, Essex League and [[Surrey]] League (which is unusual in requiring ten runners to score) to small, local leagues (such as the [[Gloucestershire]] AA league), and individual clubs can (and typically are) member of several leagues.\n\nTypically there will be four or five fixtures a season. Also, there are county championships, area championships (North, South, and Midlands), the national championship (whose location rotates around the three areas), and the Inter-Counties Championship organised by the [[UK Counties Athletics Union]], where runners compete for their counties and not their clubs.\n\nThere can be many additional inter-club matches, particularly among the older clubs. Most league matches are around {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and most championships 12 to 15&nbsp;km (approximately 7\u00bd to 9 miles) long. Most clubs are mixed, though men's and women's races tend to be run separately.\n\nSecondary school-aged students are also to compete at local schools races, with a set number of students qualifying for county level, at which there is a further race to be eligible for the relevant national schools cross country race (e.g. the English Schools Cross Country).\n\nAt university level, there is considerable competition available. University clubs typically compete both locally (via English Athletics) as well as between universities - with larger fixtures organized through [[British Universities & Colleges Sport|BUCS]].\n\nPrimary schools, although more often the juniors, also participate in cross country events and some areas of England have done so since the late 1960s. An example would be schools near [[Ouston, County Durham]] which compete as part of Chester-le-Street & District Primary Cross Country Association.<ref>[http://www.chester-le-streetschools.org.uk/athletics/ Chester-le-street schools] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425141808/http://www.chester-le-streetschools.org.uk/athletics/ |date=2012-04-25 }}.

Beginning in 1979, the [[Foot Locker Cross Country Championships]] have offered a national championship for high school cross country runners. Since 2004, the [[Nike Cross Nationals]] have offered an alternative national championship, focused on teams rather than individuals.

At that time, however, the publication of the work still in the letter \"F\" was interrupted and did not end later. Nevertheless, the volume of the material published so far reaches almost 3,300 printed pages, making it one of the greatest books of the era.\n\nEach volume appeared with a red, gilded cover with the inscription \u201cGUTENBERG LAGY LEXIKON\u201d and a gilded plant motif decoration on a brown background, as well as a gilded series and volume title. The work contained a large amount of black-and-white and color boards, text images, and art attachments.\n\n== Occurrence today ==\nThe series has not been published in a facsimile or electronic edition to date.

In recent years, they have opened 54 brick and mortar stores to combat the strategies of other low-cost competitors in Chinese markets.

One day, I pointed out to their R&D boss, some inadequacies. After that, they merely acknowledged my input, but never acted upon what I had said. So I thought to myself, if I make a phone, you can tell me anything you wish for it or what's wrong. If it is justifiable, we will work on it immediately.

He develops into a legendary figure in the [[Matter of Britain]] from the 12th century, following Geoffrey of Monmouth's influential ''Historia Regum Britanniae''.\n\nRecent theories concerning a possible historical identity of Arthur include Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in, a son of the 6th-century [[D\u00e1l Riata]] king [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]]; [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]], who led a [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] resistance against the Saxons; [[Lucius Artorius Castus]], a 2nd-century Roman commander of [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] cavalry; the British king [[Riothamus]], who fought alongside the last [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] commanders against the [[Visigoths]] in an expedition to [[Gaul]] in the 5th century; or a composite of any of these people as well as other figures and myths.\n\n\n== Etymology of \"Arthur\" ==\n{{Main|Arthur}}\n\nThe origin of the name Arthur is unclear.

''*Arto-r\u012bg-ios'' is unattested, but the root ''*arto-r\u012bg'' is the source of the [[Old Irish]] personal name ''Artr\u00ed''.<ref name=zimmer09>{{Harvnb|Zimmer|2009}}</ref> Some scholars have noted that the legendary King Arthur's name only appears as ''Arthur'', ''Arthurus'', or ''Arturus'' in early Latin Arthurian texts, and never as ''Art\u014drius'' (although the Classical Latin ''Art\u014drius'' became ''Arturius'' in some Vulgar Latin dialects). However, it may not refer to the origin of the name ''Arthur'', as ''Art\u014drius'' would regularly become ''Art(h)ur'' when borrowed into [[Welsh language|Welsh]].<ref>{{citation |last=Koch |first=John T. |chapter=The Celtic Lands |editor-first=Norris J. |editor-last=Lacy |title = Medieval Arthurian Literature: A Guide to Recent Research |location = New York, NY |publisher = Garland |year= 1996 |page = 253 |isbn = 978-0-8153-2160-6 }}</ref>\n\nHistorian [[John Morris (historian)|John Morris]] argued that the appearance of the name ''Arthur'' among Scottish and Welsh figures suggests the name became popular in early 6th-century Britain for a short time.

Gildas does mention a Briton victory against the [[Saxons]] at the \"Badonic mount\" (''mons Badonicus''), which occurred in the year of Gildas' birth and ushered in a generation of peace between the two warring peoples. This engagement is now referred to as the [[Battle of Badon]]. Gildas describes the battle as taking place \"in our times\" and being one of the \"latest, if not the greatest\" slaughter of the Saxons, and that a new generation born after Badon had come of age in Britain. Later Cambro-Latin sources give the Old Welsh form of the battle's location as Badon, such as in the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', and this has been adopted by most modern scholars.<ref name=\"Green31\">{{cite book |last=Green |first=Thomas |year=2008 |title=Concepts of Arthur |page=31 |publisher=Tempus |location=Stroud, England }}</ref>{{sfn|Padel|1994}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Green|2007}}, chapters five and seven.</ref>\n\nGildas' Latin is somewhat opaque; he does not name Arthur or any other leader of the battle. He does discuss [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] as a great scourge of the Saxons immediately prior,<ref name=\"Green31\" /> but he seems to indicate that some time had passed between Ambrosius' victory and the Battle of Badon. The details of the battle, including its date and location, remain uncertain, with most scholars accepting a date around 500; numerous locations throughout Britain have been proposed over the years.\n\n===''Historia Brittonum''===\nArthur is also not mentioned in [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''), which dates to c. 731, or any other surviving work until around 829, the date ascribed to the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', which is usually attributed to the Welsh ecclesiastic [[Nennius]], though this attribution has been disputed.<ref name=Fletcher_112>{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard |title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England |page=112 |year= 1989 |publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn |isbn = 0-85683-089-5 }}</ref> ''Historia Brittonum'' lists 12 battles fought by Arthur and gives him the title of ''dux bellorum'' (war commander or leader), saying that Arthur fought \"alongside the kings of the Britons\", rather than that Arthur was himself a king. Other accounts associating Arthur with the Battle of Mount Badon can be shown to be derived directly or indirectly from the ''Historia Brittonum''. The list is inserted between the death of [[Hengist]] and the reign of [[Ida of Bernicia]].\n\n===''Annales Cambriae''===\nThe earliest version of the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' (''Welsh Annals'') was composed in the mid-10th century. It gives the date of Badon as 516 and lists Arthur's death as occurring in 537 at the [[Battle of Camlann]]. Like the ''Annals'', all other sources that name Arthur were written at least 400 years after the events which they describe.<ref name=\"Fletcher_17\" />\n\n===''Historia Regum Britanniae''===\nArthur was first styled as a [[king of the Britons]] in [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]]'s pseudo-historical chronicle ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' (''History of the Kings of Britain''), which dates to c. 1136.{{NoteTag|''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' draws upon Gildas' ''De Excidio Britanniae'', the ''Historia Brittonum'', and the ''Annales Cambriae'', among other sources.}} Geoffrey also refers to Ambrosius Aurelianus (whom he calls Aurelius Ambrosius) as a king of Britain and an older brother of [[Uther Pendragon]], father of Arthur, thus establishing a familial relationship between Aurelianus and Arthur.

The earliest of these would appear to be the Old Welsh poem ''[[Y Gododdin]]'', preserved in a 13th-century manuscript.

Noting that the Welsh name ''Arthur'' plausibly derives from the Latin ''Artorius'', Malone suggested that certain details of Castus' biography, in particular his possible campaign in Brittany and the fact that he was obliged to retire from the military (perhaps because of an injury), may have inspired elements of Geoffrey of Monmouth's depiction of King Arthur.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Malone|1925}} Later scholars have challenged the idea, based on the fact that Artorius lived two to three centuries before the period typically associated with Arthur, and the fact that the parts of the inscriptions ostensibly similar to Arthur's story are open to interpretation.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=147\u201348}}\n\nMalone's idea attracted little attention for decades, but it was revived in the 1970s as part of a theory known as the \"Sarmatian connection\".{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Higham|2018| pp= 13\u201376}} In a 1975 essay, Helmut Nickel suggested that Artorius was the original Arthur, and that a group of [[Sarmatian]] cavalry serving under him in Britain inspired the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Nickel wrote that Castus' Sarmatian unit fought under a red dragon banner and that their descendants were still in Britain in the 5th century; he also identified similarities between the Arthurian legend and traditions associated with the Sarmatians and other peoples of the [[Caucasus]] region. He suggested that the Sarmatians' descendants kept Castus' legacy alive over the centuries and mixed it with their ancestral myths involving magical cauldrons and swords.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nIndependently of Nickel, [[C. Scott Littleton]] developed a more elaborate version of the Sarmatian connection. Littleton first wrote about the theory with Anne C. Thomas in 1978, and expanded on it in a 1994 book co-authored by Linda Malcor, ''From Scythia to Camelot''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Littleton | first1 = C.

They find parallels for key features of the Arthurian legend, including the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|Sword in the Stone]], the [[Holy Grail]], and the return of Arthur's sword to a lake, in the traditions of the Caucasus, and connect Arthur and his knights to [[Batraz]] and his [[Narts]], the heroes of the legends of the [[North Caucasus]].{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref name=green2>{{cite web |url= http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/historicity/arthur.htm |title= The Historicity and Historicisation of Arthur |last= Greene |first= Caitlin R. |year=2009 |orig-year=1998 |website = Arthuriana.co.uk |access-date= 2018-07-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome Arthurian scholars have given credence to the Sarmatian connection, but others have found it based on conjecture and weak evidence.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Few of the Caucasian traditions cited to support the theory can be traced specifically with the Sarmatians; many are known only from orally transmitted tales that are not datable before they were first recorded in the 19th century.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=149-151}}{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Additionally, many of the strongest parallels to the Arthurian legend are not found in the earliest Brittonic materials, but only appear in the later Continental romances of the 12th century or later.<ref name=green2/> As such, the traditions would have had to survive in Britain for at least a thousand years between the arrival of the Sarmatians in the 2nd century and the Arthurian romances of the 12th century.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Nonetheless, the Sarmatian connection continues to have popular appeal; it is the basis of the 2004 film ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}\n\n===Riothamus===\n[[Riothamus]] (also spelled Riotimus) was a historical figure whom ancient sources list as \"a [[king of the Britons]]\". He lived in the late 5th century, and most of the stories about him were recorded in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Jordanes]]' ''[[The Origin and Deeds of the Goths]]'', written in the mid-6th century, only about 80 years after his presumed death.\n\nAbout 460, the Roman diplomat and bishop [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] sent a letter to Riothamus asking his help to quell unrest among the Brettones, a colony of Brittonic-speaking people living in [[Armorica]]; this letter [[Riothamus#The letter|still survives]]. In the year 470, the Western Roman Emperor [[Anthemius]] began a campaign against [[Euric]], king of the [[Visigoths]] who were campaigning outside their territory in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]]. Anthemius requested help from Riothamus, and Jordanes writes that he crossed the ocean into Gaul with 12,000 soldiers. The location of Riothamus' army was betrayed to the Visigoths by [[Arvandus]], the jealous [[praetorian prefect of Gaul]], and Euric defeated him in the [[Battle of D\u00e9ols]] after Riothamus' army was driven from Avaricum ([[Bourges]]) where he had been welcomed by the [[Bituriges]] before the fight. Riothamus was last seen retreating northward to [[Burgundy]] when Euric besieged Arvernum ([[Clermont-Ferrand]]) just south of the [[Berry (province)|Bituriges territory]].\n\n[[Geoffrey Ashe]] points out that Arthur is said by Geoffrey of Monmouth to have crossed into Gaul twice, once to help a Roman emperor and once to subdue a civil war. Riothamus did both, assuming that he was a king in Britain as well as Armorica. Arthur is also said to have been betrayed by one of his advisers, and Riothamus was betrayed by one of his supposed allies. Finally, the Arthurian romances traditionally recount that King Arthur was carried off to [[Avalon]] (called ''insula Auallonis'' by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the first author to mention the legendary isle) before he died; Riothamus, after his defeat at D\u00e9ols, was last known to have fled to the kingdom of the Germanic [[Burgundians]], perhaps passing through a town called [[Avallon]] (though no ancient source on Riothamus mentions him being anywhere in the area of Avallon).\n\nIt is unknown whether Riothamus was a king in Britain or Armorica. Armorica was a Brittonic colony and Jordanes writes that Riothamus \"crossed the ocean\", so it is possible that both are correct. The name ''Riothamus'' is interpreted by Ashe and some other scholars as a title meaning \"High King\", though there is no evidence for such a title being used by ancient Britons or [[Gauls]], and the formation of the name (noun/adjective + superlative -tamo- suffix) follows a pattern found in numerous other Brittonic and Gaulish personal names.{{NoteTag|Examples include: Old Breton/Welsh ''Cunatam''/''Cunotami''/''Condam''/''Cyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Cunotamos'' \"Great Dog\"), Old Welsh ''Caurdaf'' ([[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''*Kawarotamos'' \"Great Giant\"), Old Welsh/Breton ''Eudaf''/''Outham'' (Brittonic ''*Awitamos'' \"Great Will/Desire\"), ''Uuoratam''/''Gwrdaf'' (Brittonic ''*Wortamos'' \"Supreme\"), Old Breton ''Rumatam'' (Brittonic ''*Roimmotamos'' \"Great Band/Host\"), ''Gwyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Windotamos'' \"Fairest/Whitest/Holiest One\"), Breton ''Uuentamau'' (Brittonic ''*Wenitamaua'' \"Friendliest\", and ''*Windotamaw\u0101'' \"Little Fairest/Whitest/Holiest (One)\").<ref>Lambert, Pierre-Yves; Pinault, Georges-Jean. ''Gaulois et celtique continental'', Librairie Droz, 2007, p. 464.</ref>}} Cognates of the name Riothamus survive in Old Welsh (''Riatav''/''Riadaf'') and [[Old Breton]] (''Riatam''); all are derived from [[Common Brittonic]] ''*Rigotamos'', meaning \"Most Kingly\" or \"Kingliest\".\n\n===Ambrosius Aurelianus===\n[[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] (also sometimes referred to as Aurelius Ambrosius) was a powerful [[Romano-British]] leader in Britain. He was renowned for his campaigns against the Saxons, and there is some speculation that he may have commanded the British forces at the Battle of Badon Hill. At any rate, the battle was a clear continuation of his efforts.\n\nScholars such as Leon Fleuriot identified Ambrosius Aurelianus with the aforementioned Riothamus figure from Jordanes, an idea which forms part of Fleuriot's hypothesis about the origins of the Arthurian legend.<ref>L\u00e9on Fleuriot, ''Les origines de la Bretagne: l'\u00e9migration'', Paris, Payot, 1980.</ref> Others, such as Geoffrey Ashe, disagree, since Ambrosius is not called \"king\" until the somewhat-legendary ''Historia Brittonum''.<ref>Geoffrey Ashe, ''The Discovery of King Arthur'', Guild Publishing, London, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in===\nArt\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in was the eldest son of [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]], an Irish king of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] in the late 6th century. Art\u00far never himself became king of D\u00e1l Riata; his brother [[Eochaid Buide]] ruled after their father's death. However, Art\u00far became a war leader when \u00c1ed\u00e1n gave up his role and retired to monastic life, though \u00c1ed\u00e1n was officially still king. Thus it was Art\u00far who led the [[Scoti]] of D\u00e1l Riata in a war against the [[Picts]], separate from the later war with [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]].\n\nUnder this hypothesis, Art\u00far was predominantly active in the region between [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the [[Antonine Wall]], the Kingdom of the [[Gododdin]]. He was ultimately killed in battle in 582 \u2013 thus, he lived far too late to have been the victor at the Battle of Badon, as mentioned by Gildas in the early 6th century.

He develops into a legendary figure in the [[Matter of Britain]] from the 12th century, following Geoffrey of Monmouth's influential ''Historia Regum Britanniae''.\n\nRecent theories concerning a possible historical identity of Arthur include Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in, a son of the 6th-century [[D\u00e1l Riata]] king [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]]; [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]], who led a [[Romano-British culture|Romano-British]] resistance against the Saxons; [[Lucius Artorius Castus]], a 2nd-century Roman commander of [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] cavalry; the British king [[Riothamus]], who fought alongside the last [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] commanders against the [[Visigoths]] in an expedition to [[Gaul]] in the 5th century; or a composite of any of these people as well as other figures and myths.\n\n\n== Etymology of \"Arthur\" ==\n{{Main|Arthur}}\n\nThe origin of the name Arthur is unclear.

''*Arto-r\u012bg-ios'' is unattested, but the root ''*arto-r\u012bg'' is the source of the [[Old Irish]] personal name ''Artr\u00ed''.<ref name=zimmer09>{{Harvnb|Zimmer|2009}}</ref> Some scholars have noted that the legendary King Arthur's name only appears as ''Arthur'', ''Arthurus'', or ''Arturus'' in early Latin Arthurian texts, and never as ''Art\u014drius'' (although the Classical Latin ''Art\u014drius'' became ''Arturius'' in some Vulgar Latin dialects).

Gildas does mention a Briton victory against the [[Saxons]] at the \"Badonic mount\" (''mons Badonicus''), which occurred in the year of Gildas' birth and ushered in a generation of peace between the two warring peoples. This engagement is now referred to as the [[Battle of Badon]]. Gildas describes the battle as taking place \"in our times\" and being one of the \"latest, if not the greatest\" slaughter of the Saxons, and that a new generation born after Badon had come of age in Britain. Later Cambro-Latin sources give the Old Welsh form of the battle's location as Badon, such as in the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'', and this has been adopted by most modern scholars.<ref name=\"Green31\">{{cite book |last=Green |first=Thomas |year=2008 |title=Concepts of Arthur |page=31 |publisher=Tempus |location=Stroud, England }}</ref>{{sfn|Padel|1994}}<ref>{{Harvnb|Green|2007}}, chapters five and seven.</ref>\n\nGildas' Latin is somewhat opaque; he does not name Arthur or any other leader of the battle. He does discuss [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] as a great scourge of the Saxons immediately prior,<ref name=\"Green31\" /> but he seems to indicate that some time had passed between Ambrosius' victory and the Battle of Badon. The details of the battle, including its date and location, remain uncertain, with most scholars accepting a date around 500; numerous locations throughout Britain have been proposed over the years.\n\n===''Historia Brittonum''===\nArthur is also not mentioned in [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (''Ecclesiastical History of the English People''), which dates to c. 731, or any other surviving work until around 829, the date ascribed to the ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', which is usually attributed to the Welsh ecclesiastic [[Nennius]], though this attribution has been disputed.<ref name=Fletcher_112>{{cite book |last= Fletcher|first= Richard |title= Who's Who in Roman Britain and Anglo-Saxon England |page=112 |year= 1989 |publisher= Shepheard-Walwyn |isbn = 0-85683-089-5 }}</ref> ''Historia Brittonum'' lists 12 battles fought by Arthur and gives him the title of ''dux bellorum'' (war commander or leader), saying that Arthur fought \"alongside the kings of the Britons\", rather than that Arthur was himself a king. Other accounts associating Arthur with the Battle of Mount Badon can be shown to be derived directly or indirectly from the ''Historia Brittonum''. The list is inserted between the death of [[Hengist]] and the reign of [[Ida of Bernicia]].\n\n===''Annales Cambriae''===\nThe earliest version of the ''[[Annales Cambriae]]'' (''Welsh Annals'') was composed in the mid-10th century. It gives the date of Badon as 516 and lists Arthur's death as occurring in 537 at the [[Battle of Camlann]].

Noting that the Welsh name ''Arthur'' plausibly derives from the Latin ''Artorius'', Malone suggested that certain details of Castus' biography, in particular his possible campaign in Brittany and the fact that he was obliged to retire from the military (perhaps because of an injury), may have inspired elements of Geoffrey of Monmouth's depiction of King Arthur.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Malone|1925}} Later scholars have challenged the idea, based on the fact that Artorius lived two to three centuries before the period typically associated with Arthur, and the fact that the parts of the inscriptions ostensibly similar to Arthur's story are open to interpretation.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=147\u201348}}\n\nMalone's idea attracted little attention for decades, but it was revived in the 1970s as part of a theory known as the \"Sarmatian connection\".{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=3}}{{sfn|Higham|2018| pp= 13\u201376}} In a 1975 essay, Helmut Nickel suggested that Artorius was the original Arthur, and that a group of [[Sarmatian]] cavalry serving under him in Britain inspired the [[Knights of the Round Table]]. Nickel wrote that Castus' Sarmatian unit fought under a red dragon banner and that their descendants were still in Britain in the 5th century; he also identified similarities between the Arthurian legend and traditions associated with the Sarmatians and other peoples of the [[Caucasus]] region. He suggested that the Sarmatians' descendants kept Castus' legacy alive over the centuries and mixed it with their ancestral myths involving magical cauldrons and swords.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|pp=15\u201316}}\n\nIndependently of Nickel, [[C.

New York: Garland, 2000.</ref> Littleton and Malcor argued that Artorius and the Sarmatian cavalry were the inspiration for King Arthur and his knights, but that many elements of Arthur's story derive from [[Mythology of the Caucasus|Caucasian mythology]], ostensibly brought to Britain in the 2nd century by Sarmatians and [[Alans]]. They find parallels for key features of the Arthurian legend, including the [[Excalibur#Excalibur and the Sword in the Stone|Sword in the Stone]], the [[Holy Grail]], and the return of Arthur's sword to a lake, in the traditions of the Caucasus, and connect Arthur and his knights to [[Batraz]] and his [[Narts]], the heroes of the legends of the [[North Caucasus]].{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}<ref name=green2>{{cite web |url= http://www.arthuriana.co.uk/historicity/arthur.htm |title= The Historicity and Historicisation of Arthur |last= Greene |first= Caitlin R. |year=2009 |orig-year=1998 |website = Arthuriana.co.uk |access-date= 2018-07-06 }}</ref>\n\nSome Arthurian scholars have given credence to the Sarmatian connection, but others have found it based on conjecture and weak evidence.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Few of the Caucasian traditions cited to support the theory can be traced specifically with the Sarmatians; many are known only from orally transmitted tales that are not datable before they were first recorded in the 19th century.{{sfn|Halsall|2013|pp=149-151}}{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Additionally, many of the strongest parallels to the Arthurian legend are not found in the earliest Brittonic materials, but only appear in the later Continental romances of the 12th century or later.<ref name=green2/> As such, the traditions would have had to survive in Britain for at least a thousand years between the arrival of the Sarmatians in the 2nd century and the Arthurian romances of the 12th century.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}} Nonetheless, the Sarmatian connection continues to have popular appeal; it is the basis of the 2004 film ''[[King Arthur (2004 film)|King Arthur]]''.{{sfn|Snyder|2006|p=16}}\n\n===Riothamus===\n[[Riothamus]] (also spelled Riotimus) was a historical figure whom ancient sources list as \"a [[king of the Britons]]\". He lived in the late 5th century, and most of the stories about him were recorded in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] historian [[Jordanes]]' ''[[The Origin and Deeds of the Goths]]'', written in the mid-6th century, only about 80 years after his presumed death.\n\nAbout 460, the Roman diplomat and bishop [[Sidonius Apollinaris]] sent a letter to Riothamus asking his help to quell unrest among the Brettones, a colony of Brittonic-speaking people living in [[Armorica]]; this letter [[Riothamus#The letter|still survives]]. In the year 470, the Western Roman Emperor [[Anthemius]] began a campaign against [[Euric]], king of the [[Visigoths]] who were campaigning outside their territory in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]]. Anthemius requested help from Riothamus, and Jordanes writes that he crossed the ocean into Gaul with 12,000 soldiers. The location of Riothamus' army was betrayed to the Visigoths by [[Arvandus]], the jealous [[praetorian prefect of Gaul]], and Euric defeated him in the [[Battle of D\u00e9ols]] after Riothamus' army was driven from Avaricum ([[Bourges]]) where he had been welcomed by the [[Bituriges]] before the fight. Riothamus was last seen retreating northward to [[Burgundy]] when Euric besieged Arvernum ([[Clermont-Ferrand]]) just south of the [[Berry (province)|Bituriges territory]].\n\n[[Geoffrey Ashe]] points out that Arthur is said by Geoffrey of Monmouth to have crossed into Gaul twice, once to help a Roman emperor and once to subdue a civil war. Riothamus did both, assuming that he was a king in Britain as well as Armorica. Arthur is also said to have been betrayed by one of his advisers, and Riothamus was betrayed by one of his supposed allies. Finally, the Arthurian romances traditionally recount that King Arthur was carried off to [[Avalon]] (called ''insula Auallonis'' by Geoffrey of Monmouth, the first author to mention the legendary isle) before he died; Riothamus, after his defeat at D\u00e9ols, was last known to have fled to the kingdom of the Germanic [[Burgundians]], perhaps passing through a town called [[Avallon]] (though no ancient source on Riothamus mentions him being anywhere in the area of Avallon).\n\nIt is unknown whether Riothamus was a king in Britain or Armorica. Armorica was a Brittonic colony and Jordanes writes that Riothamus \"crossed the ocean\", so it is possible that both are correct. The name ''Riothamus'' is interpreted by Ashe and some other scholars as a title meaning \"High King\", though there is no evidence for such a title being used by ancient Britons or [[Gauls]], and the formation of the name (noun/adjective + superlative -tamo- suffix) follows a pattern found in numerous other Brittonic and Gaulish personal names.{{NoteTag|Examples include: Old Breton/Welsh ''Cunatam''/''Cunotami''/''Condam''/''Cyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Cunotamos'' \"Great Dog\"), Old Welsh ''Caurdaf'' ([[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]] ''*Kawarotamos'' \"Great Giant\"), Old Welsh/Breton ''Eudaf''/''Outham'' (Brittonic ''*Awitamos'' \"Great Will/Desire\"), ''Uuoratam''/''Gwrdaf'' (Brittonic ''*Wortamos'' \"Supreme\"), Old Breton ''Rumatam'' (Brittonic ''*Roimmotamos'' \"Great Band/Host\"), ''Gwyndaf'' (Brittonic ''*Windotamos'' \"Fairest/Whitest/Holiest One\"), Breton ''Uuentamau'' (Brittonic ''*Wenitamaua'' \"Friendliest\", and ''*Windotamaw\u0101'' \"Little Fairest/Whitest/Holiest (One)\").<ref>Lambert, Pierre-Yves; Pinault, Georges-Jean. ''Gaulois et celtique continental'', Librairie Droz, 2007, p. 464.</ref>}} Cognates of the name Riothamus survive in Old Welsh (''Riatav''/''Riadaf'') and [[Old Breton]] (''Riatam''); all are derived from [[Common Brittonic]] ''*Rigotamos'', meaning \"Most Kingly\" or \"Kingliest\".\n\n===Ambrosius Aurelianus===\n[[Ambrosius Aurelianus]] (also sometimes referred to as Aurelius Ambrosius) was a powerful [[Romano-British]] leader in Britain. He was renowned for his campaigns against the Saxons, and there is some speculation that he may have commanded the British forces at the Battle of Badon Hill. At any rate, the battle was a clear continuation of his efforts.\n\nScholars such as Leon Fleuriot identified Ambrosius Aurelianus with the aforementioned Riothamus figure from Jordanes, an idea which forms part of Fleuriot's hypothesis about the origins of the Arthurian legend.<ref>L\u00e9on Fleuriot, ''Les origines de la Bretagne: l'\u00e9migration'', Paris, Payot, 1980.</ref> Others, such as Geoffrey Ashe, disagree, since Ambrosius is not called \"king\" until the somewhat-legendary ''Historia Brittonum''.<ref>Geoffrey Ashe, ''The Discovery of King Arthur'', Guild Publishing, London, 1985.</ref>\n\n===Art\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in===\nArt\u00far mac \u00c1ed\u00e1in was the eldest son of [[\u00c1ed\u00e1n mac Gabr\u00e1in]], an Irish king of [[D\u00e1l Riata]] in the late 6th century. Art\u00far never himself became king of D\u00e1l Riata; his brother [[Eochaid Buide]] ruled after their father's death. However, Art\u00far became a war leader when \u00c1ed\u00e1n gave up his role and retired to monastic life, though \u00c1ed\u00e1n was officially still king. Thus it was Art\u00far who led the [[Scoti]] of D\u00e1l Riata in a war against the [[Picts]], separate from the later war with [[Kingdom of Northumbria|Northumbria]].\n\nUnder this hypothesis, Art\u00far was predominantly active in the region between [[Hadrian's Wall]] and the [[Antonine Wall]], the Kingdom of the [[Gododdin]]. He was ultimately killed in battle in 582 \u2013 thus, he lived far too late to have been the victor at the Battle of Badon, as mentioned by Gildas in the early 6th century.

Carroll (in his book ''Arturius: A Quest for Camelot'', 1996) and by [[Michael Wood (historian)|Michael Wood]].<ref name=\"Wood\">{{cite book |last = Wood |first = Michael |title = In Search of Myths and Heroes |page = [https://archive.org/details/insearchofmythsh00mich/page/255 255] |year = 2007 |publisher = University of California Press |isbn = 978-0-520-25170-0 |url = https://archive.org/details/insearchofmythsh00mich/page/255 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[King Arthur's messianic return]]\n* [[Sites and places associated with Arthurian legend]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n:{{note|Alpha|\u03b1}} For example, Art\u00far mac Conaing,<ref>Senchus Fer Alban.

It stars its creator as an [[anthropomorphic]] orange who annoys fruits, vegetables, and various other objects by using jokes and puns, which are sometimes [[Incivility|crude]].\n\nThe show became popular, later leading to its becoming the subject of a [[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange|TV series]], a [[Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage|video game]], a range of toys, backpacks, couches, pillows, blankets, lunchboxes, drink bottles, mattresses, towels, and a T-shirt line. Other accessories, such as costumes of the series' characters, have also appeared on the market for the company.\n\nSince its inception, the ''Annoying Orange'' [[YouTube]] channel has amassed over 9 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/annoying-orange-creator-takes-collective-ds-to-court/| title=Annoying Orange Creator Takes Collective DS To Court| last=Kiley| first=Rachel| date=December 23, 2014| publisher=NMR| access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show is centered on Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]), who resides on a fruit cart display in a kitchen with other objects such as his best friend, Pear, an irritable but geeky [[Williams pear|Bartlett pear]] (also voiced by Boedigheimer). Other fruits include Passion, a sensible [[passion fruit]] and Orange's love interest played by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]], an arrogant [[grapefruit]] (voiced by Bob Jennings), a tiny but hot-blooded [[Red delicious apple]] known as Midget Apple (though he prefers the name Little Apple), a happy-go-lucky and slightly eccentric [[marshmallow]] who always sees everything filled with enthusiasm, and an elderly [[lemon]] named Grandpa Lemon, all of whom were gradually introduced into the show over the years.\n\nMost episodes consist of Orange heckling other characters until they meet a sudden and gruesome end, usually by [[Disembowelment|evisceration]] with a [[chef's knife]] (although the implements used to cut them up range from a [[blender]] to a toy [[pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]). Usually, Orange tries to \"warn\" them before it happens, blurting out the weapon-in-use, such as \"Knife!\".<ref name=\"wsj-orange\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703404004575198410669579950?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech#articleTabs%3Darticle | title= Now Playing on a Computer Near You: A Fruit With an Obnoxious Streak  | first= Geoffrey A. | last= Fowler | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= April 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrange has several recurring mannerisms. He often begins an episode by repeatedly calling for a character's attention until the character responds. Orange also often refers to the character as something that plays on the object's name or appearance (such as calling Grapefruit \"Apefruit\"). If an object behaves in a way Orange dislikes, he will often call that object an \"apple\", even if the object is not (''e.g.'', a tomato). Apart from those, Orange will often tell rude and offensive jokes, burp, fart and make childish noises with his tongue to get attention.\n\nDespite what other fruits and objects think, Orange often cannot control his tendency to be \"[[annoying]]\", and rarely intentionally tries to spite others; he usually means well for most fruits and objects. In one episode of the web series, a \"life coach\", Mango, suggests that Orange uses his annoying nature to try to cope with the destruction of the fruits he tries to make friends with. It is implied that Orange has a learning disability. \n\nRegardless of his seemingly anti-social behavior, Orange can almost always find comfort in the company of his friends and sometimes makes new ones.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*'''Orange''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - the main character who is incredibly annoying. He has the ability to spit seeds from his mouth, and has a passion for farts, TNT, kazoos, making noises, and touching his tongue to his eyeball. Despite this, he is generally good-hearted, to the point of warning his guests about their imminent deaths.\n*'''Pear''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - the only fruit who puts up with Orange (at least most of the time), and is arguably his best friend, although Pear refuses to admit it. The other foods think he is boring due to his passion for reading, and he is often the butt of many jokes throughout the series.\n*'''Midget Apple''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - A diminutive red delicious apple who prefers to be called \"Little Apple\" - as he deems the name \"Midget Apple\" to be politically incorrect towards fruits his size. He owns a monster truck, and is often ridiculed for his height, mostly by Orange. He is also an expert in horror video games, according to the gaming channel.\n*'''Marshmallow''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - Marshmallow is Midget Apple's best friend who talks in a squeaky voice and is almost always in a happy, joyful mood. He loves unicorns (his mother being a unicorn herself), rainbows, cuddly animals, and all things cute. A running gag has many foods & AO fans questioning whether Marshmallow is a boy or a girl - although Marshmallow's gender has referred to be male, according to pronouns used in reference to Marshmallow in his early appearances.\n*'''Grapefruit''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A brawny grapefruit who seems to have a bit of a temper - and is often called \"fat\" by others, usually Orange, much to his frustration. Although he was killed by Knife in his first appearance, he was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" as the head of the titular amalgamated monster, and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In earlier seasons, he acts as an antagonist, but in later seasons, he acts as an antihero and has since become part of the main cast. He has the personality of a bodybuilder, as he likes to flex, and also uses bodybuilding terms a lot. He also likes to impress others, particularly the female foods.\n*'''Passion Fruit''' (voiced by [[Justine Ezarik]]) - Passion Fruit is sweet and sassy, and is Orange's love interest - although Orange constantly refuses to admit he is in love with her out of embarrassment.\n*'''Grandpa Lemon''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - An elderly lemon who constantly falls asleep and has a tendency to mishear words. Like Grapefruit, Grandpa Lemon died in his first appearance, being sliced and juiced into a glass of lemonade, but was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In the High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episode \"Veggie Zombies\", a character called Grandma Lime was mentioned by Grandpa Lemon, which is presumed to be his wife, although it is unconfirmed whether or not she is currently living or deceased, as she was never mentioned again in the franchise.\n\n===Minor===\n*'''Knife''' (voiced by [[Kevin Nalty]], singing voice by Peter Coffin) - A knife who often kills various foods against his will - and not only is he terrified of the fact he is used to mutilate food, but also is terrified of a cruel knife sharpener who seems to find amusement in Knife's suffering.\n*'''Liam the Leprechaun''' (portrayed by Bob Jennings) - A short-tempered leprechaun who's always losing his pot of gold, and ever since his first encounter with Orange, he has become one of his most bitter enemies. He has his own YouTube channel. In early episodes of the series, Orange refers to him as the \"Jolly Green Giant\". \n*'''ZOOM''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - An [[energy drink]]. His recurring one-liner is, \"EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME!\". ZOOM also appears in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZIP''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - Another [[energy drink]] like ZOOM, stated by the latter that ZIP contains more energy per ounce. Like ZOOM, ZIP appears as a power-up in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZOOP''' (voiced by Bob Jennings, and later Aaron Massey) - Yet another [[energy drink]], but also the combination of both ZOOM ''and'' ZIP.\n*'''Squash''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - A nervous butternut squash who always ends up inadvertently falling onto various foods and crushing them to death, much to his horror and disgust, as he doesn't even intend to hurt or kill anyone.\n*'''Copper Lincoln''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A miniature copper statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who is incredibly fond of break-dancing and was birthed from an ordinary penny after it was swallowed and coughed up by a magical oyster.\n*'''Dr. Bananas''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - A brilliant, yet somewhat insane banana scientist - whose inventions have been known to be incredible achievements, or to cause certain death.\n*'''Nude Dude''' (voiced by [[Jack Douglass]], later Kevin Brueck) - An apple who became permanently naked after being put into an electric peeler. It is revealed in \"Barewolf\" that he is a werewolf.\n*'''Captain Obvious''' (voiced by [[Steve Zaragoza]]) - A sea captain onion who always points out the obvious, much to the annoyance of others.\n*'''Lou the Tick''' (voiced by Michael Wingate) - A conspiracy theorist tick who lives in a shelter, always worrying about [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] possibly taking over [[Earth]].\n*'''Orange's Sister''' (voiced by Jess Lizama) - Also referred to as Sissy, Orange's sister is just as annoying as him.\n*'''Gaming Grape''' (voiced by Shannon Jones) - A young grape who loves to play [[video game]]s on his PS4 and other [[game consoles]], much to the chagrin of his mother and his sports fanatic older brother, Game Ball. He mostly appears on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel.\n*'''Sour Rangers''' - These four sour candies that resemble [[Sour Patch Kids]] are parodies of the ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', and have saved the kitchen from the threat of domination or destruction by various villains, including Marshageddon, Lord Bread, and Chivan Stews, via the use of their powers, as well as their Gourds (which are parodies of Zords), which can be used to form Megagourd (parody of the Megazord). So far, they have starred in four episodes chronicling their adventures.\n**'''Red''' (voiced by Steven Zurita) - The team leader, Red seems to be somewhat of a braggart and also seems to be the strongest of the four. His Gourd is a zucchini, and was gifted the power of the Mussel Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Pink''' (voiced by [[Shira Lazar]]) - Pink is a gymnast and the sole female member of the team. Her Gourd is a pumpkin, and was gifted the power of the Oyster Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Yellow''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - Yellow serves as the brains of the team. His Gourd is a squash, and was gifted the power of the Clam Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Green''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - Green is the always-ignored voice of reason, as his logical ideas on how to deal with villains are always shot down by his teammates, even though they would be very effective, much to his chagrin. His Gourd is a courgette, and was gifted the power of an unknown Chowdergourd in the fourth episode (presumed to be a scallop).\n\n==Videos==\n{{Main|List of The Annoying Orange episodes}}\n[[File:Annoying Orange - Orange Coin (Ft iJustine, Steve Zaragoza, and Mikey Bolts).webm|thumb|\"Orange Coin\" episode]]\nThe first Annoying Orange episode was released on October 9, 2009.

This is generally regarded as them trashing the trailer, hence the name Trailer Trashed.\n\nMovie trailers:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* ''[[Annabelle (film)|Annabelle]]''\n* ''[[Dracula Untold]]''\n* ''[[Ouija (2014 film)|Ouija]]''\n* ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]''\n* ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1]]''\n* ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''\n* ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]''\n* ''[[The Divergent Series: Insurgent]]''\n* ''[[Furious 7]]''\n* ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''\n* ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]''\n* ''[[Poltergeist (2015 film)|Poltergeist]]''\n* ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]''\n* ''[[Jurassic World]]''\n* ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''\n* ''[[Terminator Genisys]]''\n* ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]''\n* ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''\n* ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]''\n* ''[[Smosh: The Movie]]''\n* ''[[Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation]]''\n* ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]''\n* ''[[Sinister 2]]''\n* ''[[The Visit (2015 American film)|The Visit]]''\n* ''[[Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials]]''\n* ''[[The Martian (film)|The Martian]]''\n* ''[[Crimson Peak]]''\n* ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]''\n* ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]''\n* ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2]]''\n* ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''\n* ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''\n* ''[[The Divergent Series: Allegiant]]''\n* ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''\n* ''[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|The Jungle Book]]''\n* ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]''\n* ''[[Finding Dory]]''\n* ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]''\n* ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]''\n* ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]''\n* ''[[Rogue One]]''\n* ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]''\n* ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''\n* ''[[The Emoji Movie]]''\n* ''[[Justice League (2017 film)|Justice League]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''\n* ''[[Slender Man (film)|Slender Man]]''\n* ''[[Rampage (2018 film)|Rampage]]''\n* ''[[Incredibles 2]]''\n* ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]''\n* ''[[Dumbo (2019 film)|Dumbo]]''\n* ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]''\n* ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]''\n* ''[[Toy Story 4]]''\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu]]''\n* ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''\n* ''[[Frozen II]]''\n* ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run]]''\n}}\n\nVideo game trailers:\n*''Clash of Clans: Flight of the Barbarian''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 4]]''\n* ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]''\n* ''[[FNaF World]]''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]]''\n\n====HOW2====\nHOW2 is a series of many episodes in which Orange and Pear teach everyone to do anything, which is both education and comedy. While Pear gives useful and proper advice, Orange gives advice that is misleading, confusing, or off-topic. It was released on {{Start date|2016|1|27}} with How To Tie a Tie, and despite that Orange ends much of the videos by surviving an explosion of TNT - in How to Make a Halloween Costume on {{Start date|2017|10|11}}, Pear ended the video with TNT due to Orange going overboard with terms of cows, which has become a running gag since How to be a Rapper on {{Start date|2017|8|2}}. There were 3 Christmas/New Year specials in 2016, 4 in 2017, 1 in 2018 and 12 Halloween/Shocktober-themed episodes, four in 2016, 2017, & 2018 each. As of {{Start date|2019|7|24}}, there have been ??? HOW2 episodes.\n\n====Emoji Raps====\nThe Emoji Raps star Orange rapping about several things using emojis, including himself. The first rap was released on {{Start date|2017|7|3}}. As of {{Start date|2017|12|18}}, there have been eleven raps. The eighth rap was a [[Bendy and the Ink Machine|Bendy]]-themed rap, which was on {{Start date|2017|10|12}}, the ninth rap was Marshmallow rapping instead, which was on {{Start date|2017|11|6}} and the eleventh one was Christmas-themed, which was on {{Start date|2017|12|18}}.\n\n====Annoying Orange Challenges ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|18}}, Orange released a series of challenges from the fans' comments and made a series about it that are very extreme, such as the 3 a.m. challenges. As of {{Start date|2018|2|4}}, there are seven challenges and  a  few  more .\n\n====Shocktober====\nOn every October from 2013 Onwards, horror / Halloween episodes are released to celebrate the month of Halloween. Pear is one of a few characters who happens to hate Shocktober, as first stated in the episode \"The Deviled Egg\". This particular fact was even answered in an Ask Orange question in \"Ask Orange 9\". In later years, Shocktober would also be involved in the Annoying Orange Gaming Channel, in which the characters mostly play Horror Games, games that are scary, or games that are not really scary but are still meant to celebrate Halloween; whether it'd be a videogame, an online web game, a downloadable game, DLC for a game, a fan game, and more.\n\n====Thanksgiving Episodes & Thanksgiving Series====\nThe Annoying Orange has been known to release Thanksgiving Episodes. According to all the foods in the kitchen, Thanksgiving is one of the most dangerous days of the year for foods.\n\n* ThanksGaming (Series)\n* Turducken (Episode; Released on November 7, 2014)\n* Black Friday (5-Part Series; Released from November 23 through 27, 2015; Thanksgiving takes place in Part 4 of the series, which was released on November 26, 2015.)\n* Gobble! Gobble! (Episode; Released on November 18, 2016)\n* PilGRIM Reaper (Episode; Released on November 17, 2017)\n* Thanksgiving Can Stuff It! (Episode; Released on November 16, 2018)\n\n====X-Massacre / Christ-Massacre====\nFrom {{Start date|2017|11|24}} until December 22, 2017, X-Massacre, also called Christ-Massacre, was released. This series is about different types of food being killed and served for a Christmas dinner. Each episode would feature a food from the Christmas Dinner list on the refrigerator. This list is what the foods of the kitchen call the \"X-Massacre List\" / \"Christ-Massacre List\". Whenever a food from the list would be killed, that food gets crossed out from the list.\n\n#Limp Biscuit ({{Start date|2017|11|24}}) (Item Crossed Out: Crescent Rolls)\n#Orange Beans (December 1) (Item Crossed Out: Green Bean Casserole)\n#Nutcracking the Code (December 8) (Items Crossed Out: Chestnuts and Egg Nog)\n#Figgy Pudding (December 15) (Item Crossed Out: Figgy Pudding)\n#Pig Out (December 22) (Items Crossed Out: Ham and Carrots)\n\nThis series had also been reuploaded in the form of a Saturday Supercut on December 30, 2018, 8 days after when the 5th & final episode of the series aired. It basically has all the episodes combined as one, being exactly the same, albeit with a different question of the day at the end of the Supercut.\n\n====Storytime ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|22}}, a new series was released where Pear tries to read classical children's stories and fairy tales, only for Orange to make up his own versions (which the plots are often odd or confusing), much to Pear's chagrin, which started with the second episode on {{Start date|2018|1|5}}. One episode sees Grapefruit reading a story, only for Marshmallow to twist the story up. Marshmallow appeared in a few later episodes as well.\n\nFeatured Stories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=29em|\n#Hansel and Gretel\n#Goldilocks and the Three Bears\n#The Three Little Pigs\n#Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n#Jack and the Beanstalk\n#The Emperor's New Clothes\n#The Little Mermaid\n#The Ugly Duckling\n#Beauty and the Beast\n#The Tortoise and the Hare\n#The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\n#The Boy Who Cried Wolf\n#A Christmas Carol\n#Humpty Dumpty\n#Aladdin\n#Cinderella\n#Rapunzel\n#Little Red Riding Hood\n#Puss in Boots\n#Sleeping Beauty\n#Peter Pan\n#The Snow Queen\n#Rumpelstiltskin\n#Pinocchio\n#The Sword in the Stone}}\n\n====Saturday Supercut ====\nReleasing every Saturday, Orange uploads a collection of a series of older videos, like HOW2 or all of his Wazzup videos, for example.\n\n====Annoying History====\nOn July 31, 2019, a new series of videos called Annoying History was created. Like How2 it is both education and comedy. Pear gives truthful wise information while Orange gives confusing off-topic information that would drive Pear insane.\n\n#[[Moon landing|The Moon Landing]]\n#[[Area 51]]\n#[[Oregon Trail|The Oregon Trail]]\n#[[Black Death|The Black Death]]\n\n==Annoying Orange Gaming channel==\nThe Annoying Orange has his own gaming channel, simply known as Annoying Orange Gaming.

It stars its creator as an [[anthropomorphic]] orange who annoys fruits, vegetables, and various other objects by using jokes and puns, which are sometimes [[Incivility|crude]].\n\nThe show became popular, later leading to its becoming the subject of a [[The High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange|TV series]], a [[Annoying Orange: Kitchen Carnage|video game]], a range of toys, backpacks, couches, pillows, blankets, lunchboxes, drink bottles, mattresses, towels, and a T-shirt line. Other accessories, such as costumes of the series' characters, have also appeared on the market for the company.\n\nSince its inception, the ''Annoying Orange'' [[YouTube]] channel has amassed over 9 million subscribers.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2014/12/annoying-orange-creator-takes-collective-ds-to-court/| title=Annoying Orange Creator Takes Collective DS To Court| last=Kiley| first=Rachel| date=December 23, 2014| publisher=NMR| access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe show is centered on Orange (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]), who resides on a fruit cart display in a kitchen with other objects such as his best friend, Pear, an irritable but geeky [[Williams pear|Bartlett pear]] (also voiced by Boedigheimer). Other fruits include Passion, a sensible [[passion fruit]] and Orange's love interest played by [[iJustine|Justine Ezarik]], an arrogant [[grapefruit]] (voiced by Bob Jennings), a tiny but hot-blooded [[Red delicious apple]] known as Midget Apple (though he prefers the name Little Apple), a happy-go-lucky and slightly eccentric [[marshmallow]] who always sees everything filled with enthusiasm, and an elderly [[lemon]] named Grandpa Lemon, all of whom were gradually introduced into the show over the years.\n\nMost episodes consist of Orange heckling other characters until they meet a sudden and gruesome end, usually by [[Disembowelment|evisceration]] with a [[chef's knife]] (although the implements used to cut them up range from a [[blender]] to a toy [[pinwheel (toy)|pinwheel]]). Usually, Orange tries to \"warn\" them before it happens, blurting out the weapon-in-use, such as \"Knife!\".<ref name=\"wsj-orange\">{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703404004575198410669579950?mod=WSJ_hpp_sections_tech#articleTabs%3Darticle | title= Now Playing on a Computer Near You: A Fruit With an Obnoxious Streak  | first= Geoffrey A. | last= Fowler | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date= April 26, 2010 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOrange has several recurring mannerisms. He often begins an episode by repeatedly calling for a character's attention until the character responds. Orange also often refers to the character as something that plays on the object's name or appearance (such as calling Grapefruit \"Apefruit\"). If an object behaves in a way Orange dislikes, he will often call that object an \"apple\", even if the object is not (''e.g.'', a tomato). Apart from those, Orange will often tell rude and offensive jokes, burp, fart and make childish noises with his tongue to get attention.\n\nDespite what other fruits and objects think, Orange often cannot control his tendency to be \"[[annoying]]\", and rarely intentionally tries to spite others; he usually means well for most fruits and objects. In one episode of the web series, a \"life coach\", Mango, suggests that Orange uses his annoying nature to try to cope with the destruction of the fruits he tries to make friends with. It is implied that Orange has a learning disability. \n\nRegardless of his seemingly anti-social behavior, Orange can almost always find comfort in the company of his friends and sometimes makes new ones.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main===\n*'''Orange''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - the main character who is incredibly annoying. He has the ability to spit seeds from his mouth, and has a passion for farts, TNT, kazoos, making noises, and touching his tongue to his eyeball. Despite this, he is generally good-hearted, to the point of warning his guests about their imminent deaths.\n*'''Pear''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - the only fruit who puts up with Orange (at least most of the time), and is arguably his best friend, although Pear refuses to admit it. The other foods think he is boring due to his passion for reading, and he is often the butt of many jokes throughout the series.\n*'''Midget Apple''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - A diminutive red delicious apple who prefers to be called \"Little Apple\" - as he deems the name \"Midget Apple\" to be politically incorrect towards fruits his size. He owns a monster truck, and is often ridiculed for his height, mostly by Orange. He is also an expert in horror video games, according to the gaming channel.\n*'''Marshmallow''' (voiced by Dane Boedigheimer) - Marshmallow is Midget Apple's best friend who talks in a squeaky voice and is almost always in a happy, joyful mood. He loves unicorns (his mother being a unicorn herself), rainbows, cuddly animals, and all things cute. A running gag has many foods & AO fans questioning whether Marshmallow is a boy or a girl - although Marshmallow's gender has referred to be male, according to pronouns used in reference to Marshmallow in his early appearances.\n*'''Grapefruit''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A brawny grapefruit who seems to have a bit of a temper - and is often called \"fat\" by others, usually Orange, much to his frustration. Although he was killed by Knife in his first appearance, he was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" as the head of the titular amalgamated monster, and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In earlier seasons, he acts as an antagonist, but in later seasons, he acts as an antihero and has since become part of the main cast. He has the personality of a bodybuilder, as he likes to flex, and also uses bodybuilding terms a lot. He also likes to impress others, particularly the female foods.\n*'''Passion Fruit''' (voiced by [[Justine Ezarik]]) - Passion Fruit is sweet and sassy, and is Orange's love interest - although Orange constantly refuses to admit he is in love with her out of embarrassment.\n*'''Grandpa Lemon''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - An elderly lemon who constantly falls asleep and has a tendency to mishear words. Like Grapefruit, Grandpa Lemon died in his first appearance, being sliced and juiced into a glass of lemonade, but was brought back to life in \"Frankenfruit\" and has appeared in subsequent episodes since then. In the High Fructose Adventures of Annoying Orange episode \"Veggie Zombies\", a character called Grandma Lime was mentioned by Grandpa Lemon, which is presumed to be his wife, although it is unconfirmed whether or not she is currently living or deceased, as she was never mentioned again in the franchise.\n\n===Minor===\n*'''Knife''' (voiced by [[Kevin Nalty]], singing voice by Peter Coffin) - A knife who often kills various foods against his will - and not only is he terrified of the fact he is used to mutilate food, but also is terrified of a cruel knife sharpener who seems to find amusement in Knife's suffering.\n*'''Liam the Leprechaun''' (portrayed by Bob Jennings) - A short-tempered leprechaun who's always losing his pot of gold, and ever since his first encounter with Orange, he has become one of his most bitter enemies. He has his own YouTube channel. In early episodes of the series, Orange refers to him as the \"Jolly Green Giant\". \n*'''ZOOM''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - An [[energy drink]]. His recurring one-liner is, \"EXTREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEME!\". ZOOM also appears in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZIP''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - Another [[energy drink]] like ZOOM, stated by the latter that ZIP contains more energy per ounce. Like ZOOM, ZIP appears as a power-up in the Annoying Orange App Game, \"Splatter Up!\".\n*'''ZOOP''' (voiced by Bob Jennings, and later Aaron Massey) - Yet another [[energy drink]], but also the combination of both ZOOM ''and'' ZIP.\n*'''Squash''' (voiced by [[Dane Boedigheimer]]) - A nervous butternut squash who always ends up inadvertently falling onto various foods and crushing them to death, much to his horror and disgust, as he doesn't even intend to hurt or kill anyone.\n*'''Copper Lincoln''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - A miniature copper statue of [[Abraham Lincoln]], who is incredibly fond of break-dancing and was birthed from an ordinary penny after it was swallowed and coughed up by a magical oyster.\n*'''Dr. Bananas''' (voiced by Aaron Massey) - A brilliant, yet somewhat insane banana scientist - whose inventions have been known to be incredible achievements, or to cause certain death.\n*'''Nude Dude''' (voiced by [[Jack Douglass]], later Kevin Brueck) - An apple who became permanently naked after being put into an electric peeler. It is revealed in \"Barewolf\" that he is a werewolf.\n*'''Captain Obvious''' (voiced by [[Steve Zaragoza]]) - A sea captain onion who always points out the obvious, much to the annoyance of others.\n*'''Lou the Tick''' (voiced by Michael Wingate) - A conspiracy theorist tick who lives in a shelter, always worrying about [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]] possibly taking over [[Earth]].\n*'''Orange's Sister''' (voiced by Jess Lizama) - Also referred to as Sissy, Orange's sister is just as annoying as him.\n*'''Gaming Grape''' (voiced by Shannon Jones) - A young grape who loves to play [[video game]]s on his PS4 and other [[game consoles]], much to the chagrin of his mother and his sports fanatic older brother, Game Ball. He mostly appears on the Annoying Orange Gaming channel.\n*'''Sour Rangers''' - These four sour candies that resemble [[Sour Patch Kids]] are parodies of the ''[[Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers]]'', and have saved the kitchen from the threat of domination or destruction by various villains, including Marshageddon, Lord Bread, and Chivan Stews, via the use of their powers, as well as their Gourds (which are parodies of Zords), which can be used to form Megagourd (parody of the Megazord). So far, they have starred in four episodes chronicling their adventures.\n**'''Red''' (voiced by Steven Zurita) - The team leader, Red seems to be somewhat of a braggart and also seems to be the strongest of the four. His Gourd is a zucchini, and was gifted the power of the Mussel Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Pink''' (voiced by [[Shira Lazar]]) - Pink is a gymnast and the sole female member of the team. Her Gourd is a pumpkin, and was gifted the power of the Oyster Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Yellow''' (voiced by Kevin Brueck) - Yellow serves as the brains of the team. His Gourd is a squash, and was gifted the power of the Clam Chowdergourd in the fourth episode.\n**'''Green''' (voiced by Bob Jennings) - Green is the always-ignored voice of reason, as his logical ideas on how to deal with villains are always shot down by his teammates, even though they would be very effective, much to his chagrin. His Gourd is a courgette, and was gifted the power of an unknown Chowdergourd in the fourth episode (presumed to be a scallop).\n\n==Videos==\n{{Main|List of The Annoying Orange episodes}}\n[[File:Annoying Orange - Orange Coin (Ft iJustine, Steve Zaragoza, and Mikey Bolts).webm|thumb|\"Orange Coin\" episode]]\nThe first Annoying Orange episode was released on October 9, 2009.

This is generally regarded as them trashing the trailer, hence the name Trailer Trashed.\n\nMovie trailers:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* ''[[Annabelle (film)|Annabelle]]''\n* ''[[Dracula Untold]]''\n* ''[[Ouija (2014 film)|Ouija]]''\n* ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]''\n* ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1]]''\n* ''[[The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies]]''\n* ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water]]''\n* ''[[The Divergent Series: Insurgent]]''\n* ''[[Furious 7]]''\n* ''[[Paul Blart: Mall Cop 2]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''\n* ''[[Mad Max: Fury Road]]''\n* ''[[Poltergeist (2015 film)|Poltergeist]]''\n* ''[[Tomorrowland (film)|Tomorrowland]]''\n* ''[[Jurassic World]]''\n* ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''\n* ''[[Terminator Genisys]]''\n* ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]''\n* ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]''\n* ''[[Pixels (2015 film)|Pixels]]''\n* ''[[Smosh: The Movie]]''\n* ''[[Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation]]''\n* ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]''\n* ''[[Sinister 2]]''\n* ''[[The Visit (2015 American film)|The Visit]]''\n* ''[[Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials]]''\n* ''[[The Martian (film)|The Martian]]''\n* ''[[Crimson Peak]]''\n* ''[[Spectre (2015 film)|Spectre]]''\n* ''[[The Peanuts Movie]]''\n* ''[[The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 2]]''\n* ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]''\n* ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''\n* ''[[The Divergent Series: Allegiant]]''\n* ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]''\n* ''[[The Jungle Book (2016 film)|The Jungle Book]]''\n* ''[[The Angry Birds Movie]]''\n* ''[[Finding Dory]]''\n* ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]''\n* ''[[The BFG (2016 film)|The BFG]]''\n* ''[[Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them (film)|Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them]]''\n* ''[[Rogue One]]''\n* ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]''\n* ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''\n* ''[[The Emoji Movie]]''\n* ''[[Justice League (2017 film)|Justice League]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''\n* ''[[Slender Man (film)|Slender Man]]''\n* ''[[Rampage (2018 film)|Rampage]]''\n* ''[[Incredibles 2]]''\n* ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]''\n* ''[[Dumbo (2019 film)|Dumbo]]''\n* ''[[Aquaman (film)|Aquaman]]''\n* ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019 film)|Godzilla: King of the Monsters]]''\n* ''[[Toy Story 4]]''\n* ''[[Pok\u00e9mon: Detective Pikachu]]''\n* ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]''\n* ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]''\n* ''[[Frozen II]]''\n* ''[[The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run]]''\n}}\n\nVideo game trailers:\n*''Clash of Clans: Flight of the Barbarian''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 3]]''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's 4]]''\n* ''[[Minecraft: Story Mode]]''\n* ''[[FNaF World]]''\n* ''[[Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location]]''\n\n====HOW2====\nHOW2 is a series of many episodes in which Orange and Pear teach everyone to do anything, which is both education and comedy. While Pear gives useful and proper advice, Orange gives advice that is misleading, confusing, or off-topic. It was released on {{Start date|2016|1|27}} with How To Tie a Tie, and despite that Orange ends much of the videos by surviving an explosion of TNT - in How to Make a Halloween Costume on {{Start date|2017|10|11}}, Pear ended the video with TNT due to Orange going overboard with terms of cows, which has become a running gag since How to be a Rapper on {{Start date|2017|8|2}}. There were 3 Christmas/New Year specials in 2016, 4 in 2017, 1 in 2018 and 12 Halloween/Shocktober-themed episodes, four in 2016, 2017, & 2018 each. As of {{Start date|2019|7|24}}, there have been ??? HOW2 episodes.\n\n====Emoji Raps====\nThe Emoji Raps star Orange rapping about several things using emojis, including himself. The first rap was released on {{Start date|2017|7|3}}. As of {{Start date|2017|12|18}}, there have been eleven raps. The eighth rap was a [[Bendy and the Ink Machine|Bendy]]-themed rap, which was on {{Start date|2017|10|12}}, the ninth rap was Marshmallow rapping instead, which was on {{Start date|2017|11|6}} and the eleventh one was Christmas-themed, which was on {{Start date|2017|12|18}}.\n\n====Annoying Orange Challenges ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|18}}, Orange released a series of challenges from the fans' comments and made a series about it that are very extreme, such as the 3 a.m. challenges. As of {{Start date|2018|2|4}}, there are seven challenges and  a  few  more .\n\n====Shocktober====\nOn every October from 2013 Onwards, horror / Halloween episodes are released to celebrate the month of Halloween. Pear is one of a few characters who happens to hate Shocktober, as first stated in the episode \"The Deviled Egg\". This particular fact was even answered in an Ask Orange question in \"Ask Orange 9\". In later years, Shocktober would also be involved in the Annoying Orange Gaming Channel, in which the characters mostly play Horror Games, games that are scary, or games that are not really scary but are still meant to celebrate Halloween; whether it'd be a videogame, an online web game, a downloadable game, DLC for a game, a fan game, and more.\n\n====Thanksgiving Episodes & Thanksgiving Series====\nThe Annoying Orange has been known to release Thanksgiving Episodes. According to all the foods in the kitchen, Thanksgiving is one of the most dangerous days of the year for foods.\n\n* ThanksGaming (Series)\n* Turducken (Episode; Released on November 7, 2014)\n* Black Friday (5-Part Series; Released from November 23 through 27, 2015; Thanksgiving takes place in Part 4 of the series, which was released on November 26, 2015.)\n* Gobble! Gobble! (Episode; Released on November 18, 2016)\n* PilGRIM Reaper (Episode; Released on November 17, 2017)\n* Thanksgiving Can Stuff It! (Episode; Released on November 16, 2018)\n\n====X-Massacre / Christ-Massacre====\nFrom {{Start date|2017|11|24}} until December 22, 2017, X-Massacre, also called Christ-Massacre, was released. This series is about different types of food being killed and served for a Christmas dinner. Each episode would feature a food from the Christmas Dinner list on the refrigerator. This list is what the foods of the kitchen call the \"X-Massacre List\" / \"Christ-Massacre List\". Whenever a food from the list would be killed, that food gets crossed out from the list.\n\n#Limp Biscuit ({{Start date|2017|11|24}}) (Item Crossed Out: Crescent Rolls)\n#Orange Beans (December 1) (Item Crossed Out: Green Bean Casserole)\n#Nutcracking the Code (December 8) (Items Crossed Out: Chestnuts and Egg Nog)\n#Figgy Pudding (December 15) (Item Crossed Out: Figgy Pudding)\n#Pig Out (December 22) (Items Crossed Out: Ham and Carrots)\n\nThis series had also been reuploaded in the form of a Saturday Supercut on December 30, 2018, 8 days after when the 5th & final episode of the series aired. It basically has all the episodes combined as one, being exactly the same, albeit with a different question of the day at the end of the Supercut.\n\n====Storytime ====\nOn {{Start date|2017|9|22}}, a new series was released where Pear tries to read classical children's stories and fairy tales, only for Orange to make up his own versions (which the plots are often odd or confusing), much to Pear's chagrin, which started with the second episode on {{Start date|2018|1|5}}. One episode sees Grapefruit reading a story, only for Marshmallow to twist the story up. Marshmallow appeared in a few later episodes as well.\n\nFeatured Stories:\n{{columns-list|colwidth=29em|\n#Hansel and Gretel\n#Goldilocks and the Three Bears\n#The Three Little Pigs\n#Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\n#Jack and the Beanstalk\n#The Emperor's New Clothes\n#The Little Mermaid\n#The Ugly Duckling\n#Beauty and the Beast\n#The Tortoise and the Hare\n#The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\n#The Boy Who Cried Wolf\n#A Christmas Carol\n#Humpty Dumpty\n#Aladdin\n#Cinderella\n#Rapunzel\n#Little Red Riding Hood\n#Puss in Boots\n#Sleeping Beauty\n#Peter Pan\n#The Snow Queen\n#Rumpelstiltskin\n#Pinocchio\n#The Sword in the Stone}}\n\n====Saturday Supercut ====\nReleasing every Saturday, Orange uploads a collection of a series of older videos, like HOW2 or all of his Wazzup videos, for example.\n\n====Annoying History====\nOn July 31, 2019, a new series of videos called Annoying History was created. Like How2 it is both education and comedy. Pear gives truthful wise information while Orange gives confusing off-topic information that would drive Pear insane.\n\n#[[Moon landing|The Moon Landing]]\n#[[Area 51]]\n#[[Oregon Trail|The Oregon Trail]]\n#[[Black Death|The Black Death]]\n\n==Annoying Orange Gaming channel==\nThe Annoying Orange has his own gaming channel, simply known as Annoying Orange Gaming.

The player is given [[apple]]s and [[banana]]s at the start. When the second level is reached, [[tomato]]es are added.
