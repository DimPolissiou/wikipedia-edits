The [[Greek language|Greek]] term ''karyatides'' literally means \"maidens of [[Karyes|Karyai]]\", an ancient town of [[Peloponnese]]. Karyai had a temple dedicated to the goddess [[Artemis]] in her aspect of Artemis Karyatis: \"As [[Caryatis|Karyatis]] she rejoiced in the dances of the nut-tree village of Karyai, those Karyatides, who in their ecstatic round-dance carried on their heads baskets of live reeds, as if they were dancing plants\".<ref>(Kerenyi 1980 p 149)</ref>\n\nAn [[Atlas_(architecture)|atlas]] or [[telamon]] is a male version of a caryatid, i.e. a sculpted male statue serving as an architectural support.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe origins of the term are unclear. It is first recorded in the [[Latin]] form ''caryatides'' by the Roman architect [[Vitruvius]]. He stated in his 1st century BC work ''[[De architectura]]'' (I.1.5) that the female figures of the [[Erechtheion]] represented the punishment of the women of [[Caryae]], a town near [[Sparta]] in [[Laconia]], who were condemned to slavery after betraying [[Athens]] by siding with [[Persia]] in the [[Greco-Persian Wars]]. However, Vitruvius' explanation is doubtful; well before the Persian Wars, female figures were used as decorative supports in Greece<ref>Hersey, George, ''The Lost Meaning of Classical Architecture'', MIT Press, Cambridge, MA, 1998 p. 69</ref> and the ancient Near East. Whatever the origin may have been, the association of caryatids with slavery persists and is prevalent in [[Renaissance art]].<ref>''[[The Slave in European Art]]: From Renaissance Trophies to Abolitionist Emblem'', ed Elizabeth Mcgrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) 2012</ref>\n\nThe ancient Caryae supposedly was one of the six adjacent villages that united to form the original township of Sparta, and the hometown of [[Menelaos]]' queen, [[Helen of Troy]]. Girls from Caryae were considered especially beautiful, tall, strong, and capable of giving birth to strong children.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nA caryatid supporting a basket on her head is called a ''[[Kanephoros|canephora]]'' (\"basket-bearer\"), representing one of the maidens who carried sacred objects used at feasts of the goddesses [[Athena]] and [[Artemis]]. The Erectheion caryatids, in a shrine dedicated to an archaic king of Athens, may therefore represent priestesses of Artemis in Caryae, a place named for the \"nut-tree sisterhood\" &ndash; apparently in [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] times, like other plural feminine [[toponym]]s, such as Hyrai or Athens itself.\n\nThe later male counterpart of the caryatid is referred to as a [[telamon]] (plural ''telamones'') or [[Atlas (architecture)|atlas]] (plural ''atlantes'') &ndash; the name refers to the legend of [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]], who bore the sphere of the heavens on his shoulders. Such figures were used on a monumental scale, notably in the [[Temple of Olympian Zeus (Agrigento)|Temple of Olympian Zeus]] in [[Agrigento]], [[Sicily]].\n\n==Ancient usage==\n[[File:Caryatid.jpg|thumb|upright|Intricate hairstyle of caryatid, displayed at the [[Acropolis Museum]] in Athens]]\nSome of the earliest known examples were found in the treasuries of [[Delphi]], including [[Siphnian Treasury|that of Siphnos]], dating to the 6th century BC. However, their use as supports in the form of women can be traced back even earlier, to ritual basins, ivory mirror handles from [[Phoenicia]], and draped figures from archaic Greece.\n\nThe best-known and most-copied examples are those of the six figures of the Caryatid porch of the [[Erechtheion]] on the [[Acropolis, Athens|Acropolis]] at Athens.  One of those original six figures, removed by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin|Lord Elgin]] in the early 19th century, is now in the [[British Museum]] in London.  The [[Acropolis Museum]] holds the other five figures, which are replaced onsite by replicas. The five originals that are in Athens are now being exhibited in the new Acropolis Museum, on a special balcony that allows visitors to view them from all sides. The pedestal for the caryatid removed to London remains empty. From 2011 to 2015, they were cleaned by a specially constructed [[laser beam]], which removed accumulated soot and grime without harming the marble's [[patina]].

Their bulky, intricately arranged hairstyles serve the crucial purpose of providing static support to their necks, which would otherwise be the thinnest and structurally weakest part.\n\nThe [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] also copied the Erechtheion caryatids, installing copies in the [[Forum of Augustus]] and the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]] in [[Rome]], and at [[Hadrian's Villa]] at [[Tivoli, Italy|Tivoli]].

Early interior examples are the figures of [[Heracles]] and [[Iole]] carved on the jambs of a monumental fireplace in the ''Sala della Jole'' of the [[Doge's Palace, Venice]], about 1450.<ref>Noted by James Parker, in describing the precedents for the white marble caryatid chimneypiece from [[Chesterfield House, Westminster]], now at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (Parker, \"'Designed in the Most Elegant Manner, and Wrought in the Best Marbles': The Caryatid Chimney Piece from Chesterfield House\", ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series, '''21'''.6 [February 1963] pp. 202-213).</ref> In the following century [[Jacopo Sansovino]], both sculptor and architect, carved a pair of female figures supporting the shelf of a marble chimneypiece at Villa Garzoni, near Padua.<ref>Also noted by Parker 1963:206.</ref> No architect mentioned the device until 1615, when [[Palladio]]'s pupil [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] included a chapter devoted to chimneypieces in his ''Idea della archittura universale''.

In the early 17th century, interior examples appear in Jacobean interiors in England; in [[Scotland]] the [[overmantel]] in the [[great hall]] of [[Muchalls Castle]] remains an early example.

It was built on the [[chassis]] of the proven [[Panzer III]] tank, replacing the turret with [[Casemate#Armoured vehicles|an armored, fixed superstructure]] mounting a more powerful gun. Initially intended as a mobile [[assault gun]] for direct-fire support for infantry, the StuG III was continually modified, and much like the later ''[[Jagdpanzer]]'', was employed as a [[tank destroyer]].\n\n==Development==\nThe ''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]'' originated from German experiences in [[World War I]], when it was discovered that, during the offensives on the Western Front, the infantry lacked the means to effectively engage fortifications. The artillery of the time was heavy and not mobile enough to keep up with the advancing infantry to destroy bunkers, pillboxes, and other minor fortifications with direct fire. Although the problem was well known in the German army, it was General [[Erich von Manstein]] who is considered the father of the ''Sturmartillerie'' (assault artillery). The initial proposal was from von Manstein and submitted to General [[Ludwig Beck]] in 1935, suggesting that ''Sturmartillerie'' units should be used in a direct-fire support role for infantry divisions. On 15&nbsp;June 1936, [[Daimler-Benz]] AG received an order to develop an armoured infantry support vehicle capable of mounting a {{convert|7.5|cm|abbr=on|2}} calibre artillery piece. The gun mount's fixed, fully integrated [[casemate]] superstructure was to allow a limited traverse of a minimum of 25\u00b0 and provide overhead protection for the crew.<ref>Military Intelligence Service, ''Artillery in the Desert'' (Department of War, 25&nbsp;November 1942), p.19, says depression 5\u00b0, elevation 20\u00b0, traverse only 20\u00b0 on a captured sample.</ref> The height of the vehicle was not to exceed that of the average soldier.\n\nDaimler-Benz AG used the chassis and running gear of its recent Panzer III medium tank as a basis for the new vehicle. Prototype manufacture was passed over to [[Alkett]], which produced five prototypes in 1937 on Panzer III Ausf. B chassis. These prototypes featured a [[mild steel]] superstructure and a [[Krupp]] short-barrelled, [[howitzer]]-like in appearance, [[7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24]] cannon. Production vehicles with this gun were known as '''''Gepanzerte Selbstfahrlafette f\u00fcr Sturmgesch\u00fctz 7.5&nbsp;cm Kanone Ausf\u00fchrung A bis D (Sd.Kfz.142)'''''.\n\nWhile the StuG was considered self-propelled artillery, it was not clear which land combat arm of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] would handle the new weapon. The ''[[Panzerwaffe]]'' (armoured corps), the natural user of tracked fighting vehicles, had no resources to spare for the formation of StuG units and neither did the infantry. It was agreed that it would best be employed as part of the artillery arm. The StuGs were organized into battalions (later renamed \"brigades\" for disinformation purposes) and followed their own doctrine. Infantry support using direct-fire was its intended role. Later, there was also a strong emphasis on its use as an anti-tank gun.\n\nAs the StuG was designed to fill an infantry close support combat role, early models were fitted with a [[howitzer]]-pattern, low-velocity [[7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24]] gun, much as [[Panzer IV#Ausf. A to Ausf. F1|the earliest versions]] of the fully turreted [[Panzer IV]] were. Low-velocity shells are lightly built of thin steel and carry a large charge of explosive, to destroy soft-skin targets and blast fortifications. Such shells do not penetrate armour well. After the Germans encountered the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Kliment Voroshilov tank|KV-1]] and [[T-34]] tanks, the StuG was first equipped with a high-velocity [[7.5 cm StuK 40 L/43]] main gun (spring 1942) and in the autumn of 1942 with the slightly longer [[7.5 cm StuK 40 L/48]] gun. These high-velocity guns were the same as those mounted on the [[Panzer IV]] for anti-tank use but the heavy steel wall high-velocity shells carried much less explosive and had a lower blast effect for use against infantry or field fortifications. These versions were known as the '''''7.5&nbsp;cm Sturmgesch\u00fctz 40 Ausf.F'', ''Ausf. F/8'' and '' Ausf. G (Sd.Kfz.142/1)'''''.\n\nBeginning with the StuG III Ausf. G from December 1942, a [[7.92\u00d757&nbsp;mm Mauser|7.92 mm]] [[MG34]] machine gun could be mounted on a shield on top of the superstructure for added anti-infantry protection. Some of the F/8 models were retrofitted with a shield. An additional coaxial 7.92&nbsp;mm MG34 was introduced in Mid 1944 for some production and all production by autumn 1944.\n\nThe vehicles of the ''Sturmgesch\u00fctz'' series were cheaper and faster to build than contemporary German [[tank]]s; at 82,500 [[German Reichsmark|RM]], a StuG III Ausf G was cheaper than a [[Panzer III]] Ausf. M, which cost 103,163 RM. This was due to the omission of the turret, which greatly simplified manufacture and allowed the chassis to carry a larger gun. By the end of the war, ~11,300 StuG IIIs and StuH 42s had been built.<ref name=wwiivehicles>[http://www.wwiivehicles.com/germany/self-propelled/sturmgeschutz.asp Sturmgesch\u00fctz] wwiivehicles.com</ref>\n\n==Performance against enemy vehicles==\nEstimated effective range against targets, assuming a 30-degree sideward angle.

Because of their low silhouette, StuG IIIs were easy to camouflage and be hidden and were difficult targets to destroy. As of 10&nbsp;April 1945, there were 1,053 StuG IIIs and 277 StuH 42s in German service. The StuG assault guns were cost-effective compared to the heavier German tanks such as the Tiger I and the Panther, although as anti-tank guns they were best used defensively as the lack of a traversable turret and its generally-thin armour was a severe disadvantage in the attack role. As the situation for the German military deteriorated further later in the war, more StuGs were built than tanks, particularly due to its ease of production.\n\nIn 1943 and 1944, the [[Finnish Army]] received 59 StuG III Ausf. Gs from Germany and used them against the Soviet Union. Thirty of the vehicles were received in 1943 and a further twenty-nine obtained in 1944. The first batch from 1943 destroyed at least eighty-seven enemy tanks for a loss of only eight StuGs (some of which were destroyed by their crews to prevent enemy capture).<ref name=achtungpanzer>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/stug.htm Achtung Panzer! - Sturmgesch\u00fctz III/IV<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The later batch from 1944 saw no real action. After the war, the StuGs were the main combat vehicles of the Finnish Army up until the early 1960s when they were phased out. These StuGs gained the nickname \"Sturmi\" in the Finnish military, which can be found in some plastic scale-model kits.\n\n100 StuG III Ausf. Gs were delivered to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] in the autumn of 1943. They were officially known as TAs (or TAs T3 to avoid confusion with TAs T4 (Jagdpanzer IVs)) in their army's inventory. By February 1945, 13 units were still in use with the 2nd Armoured Regiment. None of this initial batch survived the end of the war in May that year.<ref>Scafes and Serbanescu 2005, p.77</ref> Thirty-one TAs were on the Romanian military's inventory in November 1947. Most of them were probably StuG III Ausf. Gs and a small number of Panzer IV/70 (V) (same as TAs T4). These TAs were supplied by the Red Army or were damaged units repaired by the Romanian Army.<ref>Scafes and Serbanescu 2005, p.47</ref> All German equipment was removed from service in 1950 and finally scrapped four years later due to the army's decision to use only Soviet armour.\n\nStuG IIIs were also exported to other nations friendly to Germany, such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, and Spain. Hungary fielded its StuG IIIs against Soviet troops during their sweep into the country in end-1944 up until early 1945. As with Hungary, Bulgaria received several StuGs from Germany too but almost none saw service against the Soviets, the country having ended the alliance with Germany by switching sides to the Allies before the Soviets invaded. Post-WWII, these were used for a short time before being turned into fixed gun emplacements on the Krali Marko Line on the border with neighbouring Turkey. StuG IIIs were also given to the pro-German Ustashe Militia in Yugoslavia, most of which were captured in Yugoslavia by [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito's]] [[Yugoslav partisans]] during and after the war, as did German-operated vehicles. These were used by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] until the 1950s when they were replaced by more modern combat vehicles. Spain received a small number (around 10) of StuG IIIs from Germany during WWII, later sold to Syria between 1950 and 1960. Italy received the smallest number of StuG IIIs Germany distributed in the war, with only 3.\n\nAfter the Second World War, abandoned German StuG IIIs remained behind in many European nations Germany occupied during the war years, such as in Czechoslovakia,  France, Norway and Yugoslavia. The [[Soviet Union]] also captured hundreds of ex-German StuGs, most ending up being donated to [[Syria]], which continued to use them along with other war surplus armoured fighting vehicles received from the USSR or Czechoslovakia (varying from long-barrelled Panzer IVs (late models) and [[T-34-85|T-34/85]]s) during the 1950s and up until [[War over Water (Jordan river)|the War over Water]] against Israel in the mid-1960s. By the time of the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, all of them had been either destroyed, stripped for spare parts, scrapped or emplaced on the [[Golan Heights]] as pillboxes. None remain in service today. A few Syrian StuG IIIs ended up in Israeli hands and have become war memorials or simply left rusting away on former battlefields.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from [[Assault gun]] -->\nProduction numbers were:<ref name=\"Panzer_Tracts_23\"/>\n[[File:Stug III Dresden 1.jpg|thumb|A StuG III in the Military History Museum of Dresden.]]\n* '''StuG III''' prototypes (1937, 5 produced on Panzer III Ausf. B chassis): by December 1937, two vehicles were in service with Panzer Regiment 1 in Erfurt. Vehicles had eight road wheels per side with {{convert|360|mm|in|adj=on}} wide tracks, 14.5&nbsp;mm thick soft steel superstructure and the [[7.5 cm KwK 37|7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24]] gun. Although not suitable for combat, they were used for training purposes as late as 1941.\n\n[[File:StuG III Ausf A.jpg|thumb|StuG III, Ausf. A.]]\n* '''StuG III Ausf. A''' (Sd.Kfz. 142; January\u2013May 1940, 30+6 produced by [[Daimler-Benz]]): first used in the [[Battle of France]], the StuG III Ausf. A used a modified 5./ZW chassis (Panzer III Ausf. F) with front armour strengthened to 50&nbsp;mm. The last six vehicles were built on chassis diverted from Panzer III Ausf. G production.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. B''': (Sd.Kfz 142; June 1940\u2013May 1941, 300 produced by Alkett) Modified 7./ZW chassis (Panzer III Ausf. H), widened tracks (380&nbsp;mm). Two Rubber tires on each roadwheel were accordingly widened from 520&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;79&nbsp;mm to 520&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;95&nbsp;mm each. Both types of roadwheel were interchangeable. The troublesome 10-speed transmission was changed to a 6-speed one. The forwardmost return rollers were re-positioned further forward, reducing the vertical movements of the tracks before they were fed to the forward drive sprocket, and so reduced the chance of tracks being thrown. In the middle of production of the Ausf. B model, the original drive sprocket with eight round holes was changed to a new cast drive sprocket with six pie slice-shaped slots. This new drive wheel could take either 380&nbsp;mm tracks or 360&nbsp;mm wide tracks. 380&nbsp;mm tracks were not exclusive to new drive wheels, as spacer rings could be added to the older sprockets. Vehicle number 90111 shows the older drive wheel with wider 380&nbsp;mm tracks.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. C''': (Sd.Kfz 142; April 1941, 50 produced) Gunner's forward view port above driver's visor was a [[shot trap]] and thus eliminated; instead, superstructure top was given an opening for gunner's periscope. Idler wheel was redesigned.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. D''': (Sd.Kfz 142; May\u2013September 1941, 150 produced) Simply a contract extension on Ausf. C. On-board intercom installed, transmission hatch locks added, otherwise identical to Ausf. C.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. E''': (Sd.Kfz 142; September 1941{{snd}}February 1942, 284 produced) Superstructure sides added extended rectangular armoured boxes for radio equipment. Increased space allowed room for six additional rounds of ammunition for the main gun (giving a maximum of 50) plus a machine gun. One [[MG 34]] and seven drum-type magazines were carried in the right rear side of the fighting compartment to protect the vehicle from enemy infantry. Vehicle commanders were officially provided with SF14Z stereoscopic scissor periscopes. Stereoscopic scissor type periscopes for artillery spotters may have been used by vehicle commanders from the start.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. F''': (Sd.Kfz 142/1; March\u2013September 1942, 366 produced) The first real up-gunning of the StuG, this version uses the longer [[7.5 cm KwK 40|7.5 cm StuK 40 L/43]] gun. Firing armour-piercing Panzergranat-Patrone 39, the StuK&nbsp;40&nbsp;L/43 could penetrate 91&nbsp;mm of armour inclined 30 degrees from vertical at 500&nbsp;m, 82&nbsp;mm at 1,000&nbsp;m, 72&nbsp;mm at 1,500&nbsp;m, 63&nbsp;mm at 2,000&nbsp;m, allowing the Ausf. F to engage most Soviet armoured vehicles at normal combat ranges. This change marked the StuG as being more of a tank destroyer than an infantry support vehicle. An exhaust fan was added to the rooftop to evacuate fumes from spent shells, to enable the firing of continuous shots. Additional 30&nbsp;mm armour plates were welded to the 50&nbsp;mm frontal armour from June 1942, making the frontal armour 80&nbsp;mm thick. From June 1942, Ausf. F were mounted with approximately 13&nbsp;inch (334&nbsp;mm to be exact) longer [[7.5 cm KwK 40|7,5&nbsp;cm StuK&nbsp;40&nbsp;L/48]] gun. Firing above mentioned ammunition, longer L/48 could penetrate 96&nbsp;mm, 85&nbsp;mm, 74&nbsp;mm, 64&nbsp;mm respectively (30 degrees from vertical).\n* '''StuG III Ausf. F/8''': (Sd.Kfz 142/1; September\u2013December 1942, 250 produced) Introduction of an improved hull design similar to that used for the Panzer III Ausf. J / L with increased rear armour. This was 8th version of the Panzer III hull, thus the designation \"F/8\". This hull has towing hook holes extending from side walls. From October 1942, 30&nbsp;mm thick plates of additional armour were bolted (previously welded) on to speed up the production line. From F/8, the [[7.5 cm KwK 40|7.5 cm StuK 40 L/48]] gun was standard until the very last of the Ausf. G. Due to the lack of double baffle [[muzzle brake]]s, a few L/48 guns mounted on F/8s were fitted with the single baffle ball type muzzle brake used on the Panzer IV Ausf. F2/G.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. G''' (Sd.Kfz. 142/1; December 1942{{snd}}April 1945, ~8,423 produced, 142 built on Panzer III Ausf. M chassis, 173 converted from Panzer III): The final and by far the most common of the StuG series. Upper superstructure was widened: welded boxes on either sides were abandoned. This new superstructure design increased its height to 2160&nbsp;mm. The back wall of the fighting compartment got straightened, and the ventilation fan on top of the superstructure was relocated to the back of the fighting compartment. From March 1943, the driver's periscope was abandoned. In February 1943, Alkett was joined by MIAG as a second manufacturer. From May 1943, side hull spaced armour plates ''(Sch\u00fcrzen)'' were fitted to G models; these were primarily intended for protection against Russian anti-tank rifles, but were also useful against hollow-charge ammunition. Side plates were retro-fitted to some Ausf. F/8 models, as they were to be fitted to all front line StuGs and other tanks by June 1943 in preparation for the [[battle of Kursk]]. Mountings for the ''Sch\u00fcrzen'' proved to be inadequate, as many were lost in the field. From March 1944, an improved mounting was introduced; as a result, side skirts are seen more often with late model Ausf G. From May 1943, 80&nbsp;mm thick plates were used for frontal armour instead of two plates of 50&nbsp;mm + 30&nbsp;mm. However, a backlog of StuGs with completed 50&nbsp;mm armour existed. For those, a 30&nbsp;mm additional armour plate still had to be welded or bolted on until October 1943.\n\nA rotating cupola with periscopes was added for the Ausf G.'s commander. However, from September 1943, the lack of ball bearings (resulting from [[Schweinfurt\u2013Regensburg mission|USAAF bombing of Schweinfurt]]) forced cupolas to be welded on. Ball bearings were once again installed from August 1944. Shot deflectors for the cupolas were first installed from October 1943 from one factory, to be installed on all StuGs from February 1944. Some vehicles without shot deflectors carried several track pieces wired around the cupola for added protection.\n\nFrom December 1942, a square machine gun shield for the loader was installed, allowing an MG34 to be factory installed on a StuG for the first time. When stowed this shield folded back, partially overlapping the front half of the loader's hatch cover.  A curved protrusion welded to the backside of the shield pushed the shield forward as the front half of the loader's hatch cover was opened and guided the hatch cover to naturally engage a latch point on the shield thus, supporting the shield in its deployed position without exposing the loader to hostile forward fire. F/8 models had machine gun shields retro-fitted from early 1943. The loader's machine gun shield was later replaced by rotating machine gun mount that could be operated by the loader inside the vehicle sighting through a periscope. In April 1944, 27 of them were being field tested on the Eastern front. Favourable reports led to installation of these \"remote\" machine gun mounts from the summer of 1944.\n\nFrom October 1943, G versions were fitted with the ''Topfblende'' pot mantlet (often called ''Saukopf'' \"Pig's head\") gun mantlet without a coaxial mount. This cast mantlet, which had a sloped and rounded shape, was more effective at deflecting shots than the original boxy ''Kastenblende'' mantlet that had armour varying in thickness from 45&nbsp;mm to 50&nbsp;mm. The lack of large castings meant that the trapezoid-shape boxy mantlet was also produced until the very end. A coaxial machine gun was first added to boxy mantlets, from June 1944, and then to cast Topfblende, from October 1944, in the middle of \"Topfblende\" mantlet production. With the addition of this coaxial machine gun, all StuGs carried two MG 34 machine guns from fall of 1944. Some previously completed StuGs with a boxy mantlet had a coaxial machine gun hole drilled to retrofit a coaxial machine gun; however, Topfblende produced from November&nbsp;1943 to October&nbsp;1944 without a machine gun opening could not be tampered with.\n\nAlso from November 1943 onwards, all-metal return rollers of a few different types were used due to lack of rubber supply. [[Zimmerit]] anti-magnetic coating to protect vehicles from magnetic mines was applied starting in September ([[MIAG]] facility) or November ([[Alkett]] facility) 1943 and ending in September 1944.\n\n===Further variants===\nIn 1942, a variant of the StuG Ausf. F was designed with a {{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on|1}} true [[howitzer]] instead of the 7.5&nbsp;cm StuK 40 L/43 cannon. These new vehicles, designated '''StuH 42''' (''Sturmhaubitze 42'', Sd.Kfz 142/2), were designed to provide infantry support with the increased number of StuG III Ausf. F/8 and Ausf. Gs being used in the anti-tank role. The StuH 42 mounted a variant of the [[10.5 cm leFH 18]] howitzer, modified to be electrically fired and fitted with a [[muzzle brake]]. Production models were built on StuG III Ausf. G chassis. The muzzle brake was often omitted due to the scarcity of resources later in the war. Alkett produced 1,299 StuH 42 from March 1943 to 1945, the initial 12 vehicles were built on repaired StuG III Ausf. F and F/8 from the autumn of 1942 to January 1943.\n\nIn 1943, 10 StuG IIIs were converted to the '''StuG III (Flamm)''' configuration by replacing the main gun with a Schwade [[flamethrower]]. These chassis were all refurbished at the depot level and were a variety of pre-Ausf. F models. There are no reports to indicate that any of these were used in combat and all were returned to Ausf. G standard at depot level by 1944.\n\nIn late 1941, the StuG chassis was selected to carry the [[15 cm sIG 33]] heavy infantry gun. These vehicles were known as [[Sturm-Infanteriegesch\u00fctz 33B]]. Twenty-four were rebuilt on older StuG III chassis of which twelve vehicles saw combat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], where they were destroyed or captured. The remaining 12 vehicles were assigned to [[23rd Panzer Division]].\n\nDue to the dwindling supply of rubber, rubber-saving road wheels were tested during 8\u201314 November 1942, but did not see production.\n\nBombing raids on the Alkett factory resulted in significant drops in StuG III production in November 1943. To make up for this loss of production, [[Krupp]] displayed a substitution StuG on a Panzer IV chassis to Hitler on 16\u201317 December 1943. From January 1944 onwards, the [[StuG IV]], based on the [[Panzer IV]] chassis and with a slightly modified StuG III superstructure, entered production.\n\nField modifications were made to increase the vehicle's survivability, resulting in diversity to already numerous variants; cement plastered on front superstructure, older Ausf.C/D retrofitted with a KwK 40 L/48 gun, Ausf.G mounting Panzer IV cupola, a coaxial MG34 through a hole drilled on a boxy mantlet, et cetera.\n\nThe Soviet [[SU-76i]] self-propelled gun was based on captured StuG III and [[Panzer III]] vehicles.<ref name=achtungpanzer>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/stug.htm Achtung Panzer! - Sturmgesch\u00fctz III/IV<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In total, Factory #37 in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] manufactured 181 SU-76i plus 20 commander SU-76i for [[Red Army]] service by adding an enclosed superstructure and the 76.2&nbsp;mm S-1 tank gun.\n\nApproximately 10,000 StuG IIIs of various types were produced from 1940 to 1945 by Alkett (~7,500) and from 1943 to 1945 by MIAG (2,586). From April to July 1944, some 173 Panzer III were converted into StuG III Ausf. G. The 1,299 StuH 42 and the 12 conversions from StuG III were solely built by Alkett.<ref name=Panzer_Tracts_23/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016202-23A, Russland, Sturmgesch\u00fctz III vor Ortschaft.jpg|StuG III Ausf.B in the Soviet Union, 1941.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-009-0882-04, Russland-Nord, Vormarsch durch Lettland.jpg|StuG III Ausf.B in Latvia during the [[Baltic Operation]].\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B28822, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Infanterie.jpg|[[Battle of Stalingrad]]: Infantry and a supporting StuG assault gun advance towards the city center.\nFile:StuG III destroyed Normandy.jpg|A StuG III Ausf.G destroyed in [[Normandy]] by a [[Cooking off|catastrophic internal explosion]], 1944.\nFile:StuG III Ausf G, Dezember 1942.jpg|Initial Production StuG III Ausf.

It was built on the [[chassis]] of the proven [[Panzer III]] tank, replacing the turret with [[Casemate#Armoured vehicles|an armored, fixed superstructure]] mounting a more powerful gun. Initially intended as a mobile [[assault gun]] for direct-fire support for infantry, the StuG III was continually modified, and much like the later ''[[Jagdpanzer]]'', was employed as a [[tank destroyer]].\n\n==Development==\nThe ''[[Sturmgesch\u00fctz]]'' originated from German experiences in [[World War I]], when it was discovered that, during the offensives on the Western Front, the infantry lacked the means to effectively engage fortifications. The artillery of the time was heavy and not mobile enough to keep up with the advancing infantry to destroy bunkers, pillboxes, and other minor fortifications with direct fire. Although the problem was well known in the German army, it was General [[Erich von Manstein]] who is considered the father of the ''Sturmartillerie'' (assault artillery). The initial proposal was from von Manstein and submitted to General [[Ludwig Beck]] in 1935, suggesting that ''Sturmartillerie'' units should be used in a direct-fire support role for infantry divisions. On 15&nbsp;June 1936, [[Daimler-Benz]] AG received an order to develop an armoured infantry support vehicle capable of mounting a {{convert|7.5|cm|abbr=on|2}} calibre artillery piece. The gun mount's fixed, fully integrated [[casemate]] superstructure was to allow a limited traverse of a minimum of 25\u00b0 and provide overhead protection for the crew.<ref>Military Intelligence Service, ''Artillery in the Desert'' (Department of War, 25&nbsp;November 1942), p.19, says depression 5\u00b0, elevation 20\u00b0, traverse only 20\u00b0 on a captured sample.</ref> The height of the vehicle was not to exceed that of the average soldier.\n\nDaimler-Benz AG used the chassis and running gear of its recent Panzer III medium tank as a basis for the new vehicle. Prototype manufacture was passed over to [[Alkett]], which produced five prototypes in 1937 on Panzer III Ausf. B chassis. These prototypes featured a [[mild steel]] superstructure and a [[Krupp]] short-barrelled, [[howitzer]]-like in appearance, [[7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24]] cannon. Production vehicles with this gun were known as '''''Gepanzerte Selbstfahrlafette f\u00fcr Sturmgesch\u00fctz 7.5&nbsp;cm Kanone Ausf\u00fchrung A bis D (Sd.Kfz.142)'''''.\n\nWhile the StuG was considered self-propelled artillery, it was not clear which land combat arm of the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] would handle the new weapon. The ''[[Panzerwaffe]]'' (armoured corps), the natural user of tracked fighting vehicles, had no resources to spare for the formation of StuG units and neither did the infantry. It was agreed that it would best be employed as part of the artillery arm. The StuGs were organized into battalions (later renamed \"brigades\" for disinformation purposes) and followed their own doctrine. Infantry support using direct-fire was its intended role. Later, there was also a strong emphasis on its use as an anti-tank gun.\n\nAs the StuG was designed to fill an infantry close support combat role, early models were fitted with a [[howitzer]]-pattern, low-velocity [[7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24]] gun, much as [[Panzer IV#Ausf. A to Ausf. F1|the earliest versions]] of the fully turreted [[Panzer IV]] were. Low-velocity shells are lightly built of thin steel and carry a large charge of explosive, to destroy soft-skin targets and blast fortifications. Such shells do not penetrate armour well. After the Germans encountered the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Kliment Voroshilov tank|KV-1]] and [[T-34]] tanks, the StuG was first equipped with a high-velocity [[7.5 cm StuK 40 L/43]] main gun (spring 1942) and in the autumn of 1942 with the slightly longer [[7.5 cm StuK 40 L/48]] gun. These high-velocity guns were the same as those mounted on the [[Panzer IV]] for anti-tank use but the heavy steel wall high-velocity shells carried much less explosive and had a lower blast effect for use against infantry or field fortifications. These versions were known as the '''''7.5&nbsp;cm Sturmgesch\u00fctz 40 Ausf.F'', ''Ausf. F/8'' and '' Ausf. G (Sd.Kfz.142/1)'''''.\n\nBeginning with the StuG III Ausf. G from December 1942, a [[7.92\u00d757&nbsp;mm Mauser|7.92 mm]] [[MG34]] machine gun could be mounted on a shield on top of the superstructure for added anti-infantry protection. Some of the F/8 models were retrofitted with a shield. An additional coaxial 7.92&nbsp;mm MG34 was introduced in Mid 1944 for some production and all production by autumn 1944.\n\nThe vehicles of the ''Sturmgesch\u00fctz'' series were cheaper and faster to build than contemporary German [[tank]]s; at 82,500 [[German Reichsmark|RM]], a StuG III Ausf G was cheaper than a [[Panzer III]] Ausf. M, which cost 103,163 RM. This was due to the omission of the turret, which greatly simplified manufacture and allowed the chassis to carry a larger gun. By the end of the war, ~11,300 StuG IIIs and StuH 42s had been built.<ref name=wwiivehicles>[http://www.wwiivehicles.com/germany/self-propelled/sturmgeschutz.asp Sturmgesch\u00fctz] wwiivehicles.com</ref>\n\n==Performance against enemy vehicles==\nEstimated effective range against targets, assuming a 30-degree sideward angle.

Because of their low silhouette, StuG IIIs were easy to camouflage and be hidden and were difficult targets to destroy. As of 10&nbsp;April 1945, there were 1,053 StuG IIIs and 277 StuH 42s in German service. The StuG assault guns were cost-effective compared to the heavier German tanks such as the Tiger I and the Panther, although as anti-tank guns they were best used defensively as the lack of a traversable turret and its generally-thin armour was a severe disadvantage in the attack role. As the situation for the German military deteriorated further later in the war, more StuGs were built than tanks, particularly due to its ease of production.\n\nIn 1943 and 1944, the [[Finnish Army]] received 59 StuG III Ausf. Gs from Germany and used them against the Soviet Union. Thirty of the vehicles were received in 1943 and a further twenty-nine obtained in 1944. The first batch from 1943 destroyed at least eighty-seven enemy tanks for a loss of only eight StuGs (some of which were destroyed by their crews to prevent enemy capture).<ref name=achtungpanzer>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/stug.htm Achtung Panzer! - Sturmgesch\u00fctz III/IV<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The later batch from 1944 saw no real action. After the war, the StuGs were the main combat vehicles of the Finnish Army up until the early 1960s when they were phased out. These StuGs gained the nickname \"Sturmi\" in the Finnish military, which can be found in some plastic scale-model kits.\n\n100 StuG III Ausf. Gs were delivered to [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] in the autumn of 1943. They were officially known as TAs (or TAs T3 to avoid confusion with TAs T4 (Jagdpanzer IVs)) in their army's inventory. By February 1945, 13 units were still in use with the 2nd Armoured Regiment. None of this initial batch survived the end of the war in May that year.<ref>Scafes and Serbanescu 2005, p.77</ref> Thirty-one TAs were on the Romanian military's inventory in November 1947. Most of them were probably StuG III Ausf. Gs and a small number of Panzer IV/70 (V) (same as TAs T4). These TAs were supplied by the Red Army or were damaged units repaired by the Romanian Army.<ref>Scafes and Serbanescu 2005, p.47</ref> All German equipment was removed from service in 1950 and finally scrapped four years later due to the army's decision to use only Soviet armour.\n\nStuG IIIs were also exported to other nations friendly to Germany, such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, and Spain. Hungary fielded its StuG IIIs against Soviet troops during their sweep into the country in end-1944 up until early 1945. As with Hungary, Bulgaria received several StuGs from Germany too but almost none saw service against the Soviets, the country having ended the alliance with Germany by switching sides to the Allies before the Soviets invaded. Post-WWII, these were used for a short time before being turned into fixed gun emplacements on the Krali Marko Line on the border with neighbouring Turkey. StuG IIIs were also given to the pro-German Ustashe Militia in Yugoslavia, most of which were captured in Yugoslavia by [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito's]] [[Yugoslav partisans]] during and after the war, as did German-operated vehicles. These were used by the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] until the 1950s when they were replaced by more modern combat vehicles. Spain received a small number (around 10) of StuG IIIs from Germany during WWII, later sold to Syria between 1950 and 1960. Italy received the smallest number of StuG IIIs Germany distributed in the war, with only 3.\n\nAfter the Second World War, abandoned German StuG IIIs remained behind in many European nations Germany occupied during the war years, such as in Czechoslovakia,  France, Norway and Yugoslavia. The [[Soviet Union]] also captured hundreds of ex-German StuGs, most ending up being donated to [[Syria]], which continued to use them along with other war surplus armoured fighting vehicles received from the USSR or Czechoslovakia (varying from long-barrelled Panzer IVs (late models) and [[T-34-85|T-34/85]]s) during the 1950s and up until [[War over Water (Jordan river)|the War over Water]] against Israel in the mid-1960s. By the time of the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, all of them had been either destroyed, stripped for spare parts, scrapped or emplaced on the [[Golan Heights]] as pillboxes. None remain in service today. A few Syrian StuG IIIs ended up in Israeli hands and have become war memorials or simply left rusting away on former battlefields.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from [[Assault gun]] -->\nProduction numbers were:<ref name=\"Panzer_Tracts_23\"/>\n[[File:Stug III Dresden 1.jpg|thumb|A StuG III in the Military History Museum of Dresden.]]\n* '''StuG III''' prototypes (1937, 5 produced on Panzer III Ausf. B chassis): by December 1937, two vehicles were in service with Panzer Regiment 1 in Erfurt. Vehicles had eight road wheels per side with {{convert|360|mm|in|adj=on}} wide tracks, 14.5&nbsp;mm thick soft steel superstructure and the [[7.5 cm KwK 37|7.5 cm StuK 37 L/24]] gun. Although not suitable for combat, they were used for training purposes as late as 1941.\n\n[[File:StuG III Ausf A.jpg|thumb|StuG III, Ausf. A.]]\n* '''StuG III Ausf. A''' (Sd.Kfz. 142; January\u2013May 1940, 30+6 produced by [[Daimler-Benz]]): first used in the [[Battle of France]], the StuG III Ausf. A used a modified 5./ZW chassis (Panzer III Ausf. F) with front armour strengthened to 50&nbsp;mm. The last six vehicles were built on chassis diverted from Panzer III Ausf. G production.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. B''': (Sd.Kfz 142; June 1940\u2013May 1941, 300 produced by Alkett) Modified 7./ZW chassis (Panzer III Ausf. H), widened tracks (380&nbsp;mm). Two Rubber tires on each roadwheel were accordingly widened from 520&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;79&nbsp;mm to 520&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;95&nbsp;mm each. Both types of roadwheel were interchangeable. The troublesome 10-speed transmission was changed to a 6-speed one. The forwardmost return rollers were re-positioned further forward, reducing the vertical movements of the tracks before they were fed to the forward drive sprocket, and so reduced the chance of tracks being thrown. In the middle of production of the Ausf. B model, the original drive sprocket with eight round holes was changed to a new cast drive sprocket with six pie slice-shaped slots. This new drive wheel could take either 380&nbsp;mm tracks or 360&nbsp;mm wide tracks. 380&nbsp;mm tracks were not exclusive to new drive wheels, as spacer rings could be added to the older sprockets. Vehicle number 90111 shows the older drive wheel with wider 380&nbsp;mm tracks.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. C''': (Sd.Kfz 142; April 1941, 50 produced) Gunner's forward view port above driver's visor was a [[shot trap]] and thus eliminated; instead, superstructure top was given an opening for gunner's periscope. Idler wheel was redesigned.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. D''': (Sd.Kfz 142; May\u2013September 1941, 150 produced) Simply a contract extension on Ausf. C. On-board intercom installed, transmission hatch locks added, otherwise identical to Ausf. C.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. E''': (Sd.Kfz 142; September 1941{{snd}}February 1942, 284 produced) Superstructure sides added extended rectangular armoured boxes for radio equipment. Increased space allowed room for six additional rounds of ammunition for the main gun (giving a maximum of 50) plus a machine gun. One [[MG 34]] and seven drum-type magazines were carried in the right rear side of the fighting compartment to protect the vehicle from enemy infantry. Vehicle commanders were officially provided with SF14Z stereoscopic scissor periscopes. Stereoscopic scissor type periscopes for artillery spotters may have been used by vehicle commanders from the start.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. F''': (Sd.Kfz 142/1; March\u2013September 1942, 366 produced) The first real up-gunning of the StuG, this version uses the longer [[7.5 cm KwK 40|7.5 cm StuK 40 L/43]] gun. Firing armour-piercing Panzergranat-Patrone 39, the StuK&nbsp;40&nbsp;L/43 could penetrate 91&nbsp;mm of armour inclined 30 degrees from vertical at 500&nbsp;m, 82&nbsp;mm at 1,000&nbsp;m, 72&nbsp;mm at 1,500&nbsp;m, 63&nbsp;mm at 2,000&nbsp;m, allowing the Ausf. F to engage most Soviet armoured vehicles at normal combat ranges. This change marked the StuG as being more of a tank destroyer than an infantry support vehicle. An exhaust fan was added to the rooftop to evacuate fumes from spent shells, to enable the firing of continuous shots. Additional 30&nbsp;mm armour plates were welded to the 50&nbsp;mm frontal armour from June 1942, making the frontal armour 80&nbsp;mm thick. From June 1942, Ausf. F were mounted with approximately 13&nbsp;inch (334&nbsp;mm to be exact) longer [[7.5 cm KwK 40|7,5&nbsp;cm StuK&nbsp;40&nbsp;L/48]] gun. Firing above mentioned ammunition, longer L/48 could penetrate 96&nbsp;mm, 85&nbsp;mm, 74&nbsp;mm, 64&nbsp;mm respectively (30 degrees from vertical).\n* '''StuG III Ausf. F/8''': (Sd.Kfz 142/1; September\u2013December 1942, 250 produced) Introduction of an improved hull design similar to that used for the Panzer III Ausf. J / L with increased rear armour. This was 8th version of the Panzer III hull, thus the designation \"F/8\". This hull has towing hook holes extending from side walls. From October 1942, 30&nbsp;mm thick plates of additional armour were bolted (previously welded) on to speed up the production line. From F/8, the [[7.5 cm KwK 40|7.5 cm StuK 40 L/48]] gun was standard until the very last of the Ausf. G. Due to the lack of double baffle [[muzzle brake]]s, a few L/48 guns mounted on F/8s were fitted with the single baffle ball type muzzle brake used on the Panzer IV Ausf. F2/G.\n* '''StuG III Ausf. G''' (Sd.Kfz. 142/1; December 1942{{snd}}April 1945, ~8,423 produced, 142 built on Panzer III Ausf. M chassis, 173 converted from Panzer III): The final and by far the most common of the StuG series. Upper superstructure was widened: welded boxes on either sides were abandoned. This new superstructure design increased its height to 2160&nbsp;mm. The back wall of the fighting compartment got straightened, and the ventilation fan on top of the superstructure was relocated to the back of the fighting compartment. From March 1943, the driver's periscope was abandoned. In February 1943, Alkett was joined by MIAG as a second manufacturer. From May 1943, side hull spaced armour plates ''(Sch\u00fcrzen)'' were fitted to G models; these were primarily intended for protection against Russian anti-tank rifles, but were also useful against hollow-charge ammunition. Side plates were retro-fitted to some Ausf. F/8 models, as they were to be fitted to all front line StuGs and other tanks by June 1943 in preparation for the [[battle of Kursk]]. Mountings for the ''Sch\u00fcrzen'' proved to be inadequate, as many were lost in the field. From March 1944, an improved mounting was introduced; as a result, side skirts are seen more often with late model Ausf G. From May 1943, 80&nbsp;mm thick plates were used for frontal armour instead of two plates of 50&nbsp;mm + 30&nbsp;mm. However, a backlog of StuGs with completed 50&nbsp;mm armour existed. For those, a 30&nbsp;mm additional armour plate still had to be welded or bolted on until October 1943.\n\nA rotating cupola with periscopes was added for the Ausf G.'s commander. However, from September 1943, the lack of ball bearings (resulting from [[Schweinfurt\u2013Regensburg mission|USAAF bombing of Schweinfurt]]) forced cupolas to be welded on. Ball bearings were once again installed from August 1944. Shot deflectors for the cupolas were first installed from October 1943 from one factory, to be installed on all StuGs from February 1944. Some vehicles without shot deflectors carried several track pieces wired around the cupola for added protection.\n\nFrom December 1942, a square machine gun shield for the loader was installed, allowing an MG34 to be factory installed on a StuG for the first time. When stowed this shield folded back, partially overlapping the front half of the loader's hatch cover.  A curved protrusion welded to the backside of the shield pushed the shield forward as the front half of the loader's hatch cover was opened and guided the hatch cover to naturally engage a latch point on the shield thus, supporting the shield in its deployed position without exposing the loader to hostile forward fire. F/8 models had machine gun shields retro-fitted from early 1943. The loader's machine gun shield was later replaced by rotating machine gun mount that could be operated by the loader inside the vehicle sighting through a periscope. In April 1944, 27 of them were being field tested on the Eastern front. Favourable reports led to installation of these \"remote\" machine gun mounts from the summer of 1944.\n\nFrom October 1943, G versions were fitted with the ''Topfblende'' pot mantlet (often called ''Saukopf'' \"Pig's head\") gun mantlet without a coaxial mount. This cast mantlet, which had a sloped and rounded shape, was more effective at deflecting shots than the original boxy ''Kastenblende'' mantlet that had armour varying in thickness from 45&nbsp;mm to 50&nbsp;mm. The lack of large castings meant that the trapezoid-shape boxy mantlet was also produced until the very end. A coaxial machine gun was first added to boxy mantlets, from June 1944, and then to cast Topfblende, from October 1944, in the middle of \"Topfblende\" mantlet production. With the addition of this coaxial machine gun, all StuGs carried two MG 34 machine guns from fall of 1944. Some previously completed StuGs with a boxy mantlet had a coaxial machine gun hole drilled to retrofit a coaxial machine gun; however, Topfblende produced from November&nbsp;1943 to October&nbsp;1944 without a machine gun opening could not be tampered with.\n\nAlso from November 1943 onwards, all-metal return rollers of a few different types were used due to lack of rubber supply. [[Zimmerit]] anti-magnetic coating to protect vehicles from magnetic mines was applied starting in September ([[MIAG]] facility) or November ([[Alkett]] facility) 1943 and ending in September 1944.\n\n===Further variants===\nIn 1942, a variant of the StuG Ausf. F was designed with a {{convert|10.5|cm|abbr=on|1}} true [[howitzer]] instead of the 7.5&nbsp;cm StuK 40 L/43 cannon. These new vehicles, designated '''StuH 42''' (''Sturmhaubitze 42'', Sd.Kfz 142/2), were designed to provide infantry support with the increased number of StuG III Ausf. F/8 and Ausf. Gs being used in the anti-tank role. The StuH 42 mounted a variant of the [[10.5 cm leFH 18]] howitzer, modified to be electrically fired and fitted with a [[muzzle brake]]. Production models were built on StuG III Ausf. G chassis. The muzzle brake was often omitted due to the scarcity of resources later in the war. Alkett produced 1,299 StuH 42 from March 1943 to 1945, the initial 12 vehicles were built on repaired StuG III Ausf. F and F/8 from the autumn of 1942 to January 1943.\n\nIn 1943, 10 StuG IIIs were converted to the '''StuG III (Flamm)''' configuration by replacing the main gun with a Schwade [[flamethrower]]. These chassis were all refurbished at the depot level and were a variety of pre-Ausf. F models. There are no reports to indicate that any of these were used in combat and all were returned to Ausf. G standard at depot level by 1944.\n\nIn late 1941, the StuG chassis was selected to carry the [[15 cm sIG 33]] heavy infantry gun. These vehicles were known as [[Sturm-Infanteriegesch\u00fctz 33B]]. Twenty-four were rebuilt on older StuG III chassis of which twelve vehicles saw combat in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], where they were destroyed or captured. The remaining 12 vehicles were assigned to [[23rd Panzer Division]].\n\nDue to the dwindling supply of rubber, rubber-saving road wheels were tested during 8\u201314 November 1942, but did not see production.\n\nBombing raids on the Alkett factory resulted in significant drops in StuG III production in November 1943. To make up for this loss of production, [[Krupp]] displayed a substitution StuG on a Panzer IV chassis to Hitler on 16\u201317 December 1943. From January 1944 onwards, the [[StuG IV]], based on the [[Panzer IV]] chassis and with a slightly modified StuG III superstructure, entered production.\n\nField modifications were made to increase the vehicle's survivability, resulting in diversity to already numerous variants; cement plastered on front superstructure, older Ausf.C/D retrofitted with a KwK 40 L/48 gun, Ausf.G mounting Panzer IV cupola, a coaxial MG34 through a hole drilled on a boxy mantlet, et cetera.\n\nThe Soviet [[SU-76i]] self-propelled gun was based on captured StuG III and [[Panzer III]] vehicles.<ref name=achtungpanzer>[http://www.achtungpanzer.com/stug.htm Achtung Panzer! - Sturmgesch\u00fctz III/IV<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In total, Factory #37 in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]] manufactured 181 SU-76i plus 20 commander SU-76i for [[Red Army]] service by adding an enclosed superstructure and the 76.2&nbsp;mm S-1 tank gun.\n\nApproximately 10,000 StuG IIIs of various types were produced from 1940 to 1945 by Alkett (~7,500) and from 1943 to 1945 by MIAG (2,586). From April to July 1944, some 173 Panzer III were converted into StuG III Ausf. G. The 1,299 StuH 42 and the 12 conversions from StuG III were solely built by Alkett.<ref name=Panzer_Tracts_23/>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"140px\">\nFile:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F016202-23A, Russland, Sturmgesch\u00fctz III vor Ortschaft.jpg|StuG III Ausf.B in the Soviet Union, 1941.\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-009-0882-04, Russland-Nord, Vormarsch durch Lettland.jpg|StuG III Ausf.B in Latvia during the [[Baltic Operation]].\nFile:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B28822, Russland, Kampf um Stalingrad, Infanterie.jpg|[[Battle of Stalingrad]]: Infantry and a supporting StuG assault gun advance towards the city center.\nFile:StuG III destroyed Normandy.jpg|A StuG III Ausf.G destroyed in [[Normandy]] by a [[Cooking off|catastrophic internal explosion]], 1944.\nFile:StuG III Ausf G, Dezember 1942.jpg|Initial Production StuG III Ausf.

It was incorporated in 1950 and is located at kilometre 1426 (Historic Mile 918) on the [[Alaska Highway]] in southern Yukon. Whitehorse's [[Downtown Whitehorse|downtown]] and [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]] areas occupy both shores of the [[Yukon River]], which originates in [[British Columbia]] and meets the [[Bering Sea]] in Alaska. The city was named after the [[White Horse Rapids]] for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse, near [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]], before the river was dammed.\n\nBecause of the city's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]], the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as [[Yellowknife]].<ref name=\"Pinard 227\u2013237\">{{cite journal|last=Pinard|first=Jean-Paul|title=Wind Climate of the Whitehorse Area|journal=Arctic|date=September 2007|volume=60|issue=3|pages=227\u2013237|doi=10.14430/arctic215|url=http://www.esc.gov.yk.ca/pdf/wind_climate_of_the_whitehorse_area.pdf}}</ref> At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/canada/whitehorse?month=6|title=Sunrise and sunset times in Whitehorse, June 2018|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref><ref name=\"thecanadianencyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Whitehorse|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008565|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref> Whitehorse, as reported by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', is the city with the least air pollution in the world.<ref>''Guinness World Records 2013'', Page 036 (Hardcover edition). {{ISBN|9781904994879}}</ref>\n\nAs of the [[Canada 2016 census|2016 census]], the population was 25,085.<ref>{{cite web |title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Whitehorse, City [Census subdivision], Yukon and Yukon, Territory [Census division], Yukon |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=6001009&Geo2=CD&Code2=6001&Data=Count&SearchText=Whitehorse&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1 |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Statistics Canada-Government of Canada |date=8 February 2017}}</ref> This represents approximately 70 percent of the entire population of Yukon territory.\n\n==History==\nArcheological research south of the downtown area, at a location known as [[Canyon City, Yukon|Canyon City]], has revealed evidence of use by First Nations for several thousand years. The surrounding area had seasonal fish camps and [[Frederick Schwatka]], in 1883, observed the presence of a portage trail used to bypass [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]]. Before the Gold Rush, several different tribes passed through the area seasonally and their territories overlapped.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in August 1896, by [[Skookum Jim]], [[Tagish Charlie]], and [[George Washington Carmack]], set off a major change in the historical patterns of the region. Early prospectors used the [[Chilkoot Pass]], but by July 1897, crowds of neophyte [[stampede]]rs had arrived via steamship and were camping at \"White Horse\". By June 1898, there was a bottleneck of stampeders at Canyon City, many boats had been lost to the rapids as well as five people. [[Samuel Steele]] of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] said: \"why more casualties have not occurred is a mystery to me.\"\n\nOn their way to find gold, stampeders also found copper in the \"[[copper belt]]\" in the hills west of Whitehorse. The first copper claims were staked by Jack McIntyre on July 6, 1898, and [[The Cremation of Sam McGee|Sam McGee]] on July 16, 1899. Two tram lines were built, one {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} stretch on the east bank of the Yukon River from Canyon City to the rapids, just across from the present day downtown, the other was built on the west bank of the river. A small settlement was developing at Canyon City but the completion of the White Pass railway to Whitehorse in 1900 put a halt to it.\n[[File:Street in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, ca 1900 (HESTER 312).jpeg|thumb|left|Streetscape of Whitehorse in 1900. The community saw a population boom with the [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in 1896.]]\nThe [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] [[narrow-gauge]] railway linking [[Skagway]] to Whitehorse had begun construction in May 1898, by May 1899 construction had arrived at the south end of [[Bennett Lake]]. Construction began again at the north end of Bennett lake to Whitehorse. It was only in June\u2013July 1900 that construction finished the difficult Bennett Lake section itself, completing the entire route.\n\nBy 1901, the [[Whitehorse Star]] was already reporting on daily freight volumes. That summer there were four trains per day. Even though traders and prospectors were all calling the city Whitehorse (White Horse), there was an attempt by the railway people to change the name to Closeleigh (British Close brothers provided funding for the railway), this was refused by [[William Ogilvie (surveyor)|William Ogilvie]], the territory's Commissioner. Whitehorse was booming.\n\nOn May 23, 1905, a small fire in the barber shop of the Windsor Hotel got out of control when the fire engine ran out of water, spreading throughout the city and causing $300,000 in damage, though no lives were lost. [[Robert Service]] was working as a bank teller at the time and participated in suppressing the flame.<ref>{{cite web |title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Whitehorse swept by fire |url=https://www.whitehorsestar.com/History/whitehorse-swept-by-fire1 |website=Whitehorse Daily Star |language=en}}</ref> The White Horse Restaurant and Inn was among the buildings destroyed, after its co-founder [[Frederick Trump]], the grandfather of [[Donald Trump]], had sold his shares and left the city.<ref>Gwenda Blair (2000).

Until 1942, rail, river, and air were the only way to get to Whitehorse, but in 1942 the US military decided an interior road would be safer to transfer troops and provisions between Alaska and the US mainland and began construction of the [[Alaska Highway]]. The entire {{convert|2500|km|0|abbr=on}} project was accomplished between March and November 1942. The Canadian portion of the highway was only returned to Canadian sovereignty after the war. The [[Canol pipeline]] was also constructed to supply oil to the north with a refinery in Whitehorse.\n\nIn 1950 the city was incorporated and by 1951, the population had doubled from its 1941 numbers. On April 1, 1953, the city was designated the capital of the Yukon Territory when the seat was moved from [[Dawson City]] after the construction of the [[Klondike Highway]].<ref name=\"Traveller's Guide\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.visitwhitehorse.com/\n |title=The Whitehorse Interactive Traveller's Guide\n |accessdate=2006-07-03\n |pages=History\u2013>Facts\u2013>Whitehorse\u2013>The Name \"Whitehorse\"}}</ref> On March 21, 1957, the name was officially changed from White Horse to Whitehorse.<ref name=\"ref1\">Robert G.

It was incorporated in 1950 and is located at kilometre 1426 (Historic Mile 918) on the [[Alaska Highway]] in southern Yukon. Whitehorse's [[Downtown Whitehorse|downtown]] and [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]] areas occupy both shores of the [[Yukon River]], which originates in [[British Columbia]] and meets the [[Bering Sea]] in Alaska. The city was named after the [[White Horse Rapids]] for their resemblance to the mane of a white horse, near [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]], before the river was dammed.\n\nBecause of the city's location in the Whitehorse valley and relative proximity to the [[Pacific Ocean]], the climate is milder than comparable northern communities such as [[Yellowknife]].<ref name=\"Pinard 227\u2013237\">{{cite journal|last=Pinard|first=Jean-Paul|title=Wind Climate of the Whitehorse Area|journal=Arctic|date=September 2007|volume=60|issue=3|pages=227\u2013237|doi=10.14430/arctic215|url=http://www.esc.gov.yk.ca/pdf/wind_climate_of_the_whitehorse_area.pdf}}</ref> At this latitude winter days are short and summer days have up to about 19 hours of daylight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/sun/canada/whitehorse?month=6|title=Sunrise and sunset times in Whitehorse, June 2018|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref><ref name=\"thecanadianencyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Whitehorse|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&Params=A1ARTA0008565|work=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-03-25}}</ref> Whitehorse, as reported by ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', is the city with the least air pollution in the world.<ref>''Guinness World Records 2013'', Page 036 (Hardcover edition). {{ISBN|9781904994879}}</ref>\n\nAs of the [[Canada 2016 census|2016 census]], the population was 25,085.<ref>{{cite web |title=Census Profile, 2016 Census - Whitehorse, City [Census subdivision], Yukon and Yukon, Territory [Census division], Yukon |url=https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=6001009&Geo2=CD&Code2=6001&Data=Count&SearchText=Whitehorse&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All&TABID=1 |website=www12.statcan.gc.ca |publisher=Statistics Canada-Government of Canada |date=8 February 2017}}</ref> This represents approximately 70 percent of the entire population of Yukon territory.\n\n==History==\nArcheological research south of the downtown area, at a location known as [[Canyon City, Yukon|Canyon City]], has revealed evidence of use by First Nations for several thousand years. The surrounding area had seasonal fish camps and [[Frederick Schwatka]], in 1883, observed the presence of a portage trail used to bypass [[Miles Canyon Basalts|Miles Canyon]]. Before the Gold Rush, several different tribes passed through the area seasonally and their territories overlapped.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\nThe [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in August 1896, by [[Skookum Jim]], [[Tagish Charlie]], and [[George Washington Carmack]], set off a major change in the historical patterns of the region. Early prospectors used the [[Chilkoot Pass]], but by July 1897, crowds of neophyte [[stampede]]rs had arrived via steamship and were camping at \"White Horse\". By June 1898, there was a bottleneck of stampeders at Canyon City, many boats had been lost to the rapids as well as five people. [[Samuel Steele]] of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] said: \"why more casualties have not occurred is a mystery to me.\"\n\nOn their way to find gold, stampeders also found copper in the \"[[copper belt]]\" in the hills west of Whitehorse. The first copper claims were staked by Jack McIntyre on July 6, 1898, and [[The Cremation of Sam McGee|Sam McGee]] on July 16, 1899. Two tram lines were built, one {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=on}} stretch on the east bank of the Yukon River from Canyon City to the rapids, just across from the present day downtown, the other was built on the west bank of the river. A small settlement was developing at Canyon City but the completion of the White Pass railway to Whitehorse in 1900 put a halt to it.\n[[File:Street in Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, ca 1900 (HESTER 312).jpeg|thumb|left|Streetscape of Whitehorse in 1900. The community saw a population boom with the [[Klondike Gold Rush|discovery of gold in the Klondike]] in 1896.]]\nThe [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] [[narrow-gauge]] railway linking [[Skagway]] to Whitehorse had begun construction in May 1898, by May 1899 construction had arrived at the south end of [[Bennett Lake]]. Construction began again at the north end of Bennett lake to Whitehorse. It was only in June\u2013July 1900 that construction finished the difficult Bennett Lake section itself, completing the entire route.\n\nBy 1901, the [[Whitehorse Star]] was already reporting on daily freight volumes. That summer there were four trains per day. Even though traders and prospectors were all calling the city Whitehorse (White Horse), there was an attempt by the railway people to change the name to Closeleigh (British Close brothers provided funding for the railway), this was refused by [[William Ogilvie (surveyor)|William Ogilvie]], the territory's Commissioner. Whitehorse was booming.\n\nOn May 23, 1905, a small fire in the barber shop of the Windsor Hotel got out of control when the fire engine ran out of water, spreading throughout the city and causing $300,000 in damage, though no lives were lost. [[Robert Service]] was working as a bank teller at the time and participated in suppressing the flame.<ref>{{cite web |title=Whitehorse Daily Star: Whitehorse swept by fire |url=https://www.whitehorsestar.com/History/whitehorse-swept-by-fire1 |website=Whitehorse Daily Star |language=en}}</ref> The White Horse Restaurant and Inn was among the buildings destroyed, after its co-founder [[Frederick Trump]], the grandfather of [[Donald Trump]], had sold his shares and left the city.<ref>Gwenda Blair (2000).

Until 1942, rail, river, and air were the only way to get to Whitehorse, but in 1942 the US military decided an interior road would be safer to transfer troops and provisions between Alaska and the US mainland and began construction of the [[Alaska Highway]]. The entire {{convert|2500|km|0|abbr=on}} project was accomplished between March and November 1942. The Canadian portion of the highway was only returned to Canadian sovereignty after the war. The [[Canol pipeline]] was also constructed to supply oil to the north with a refinery in Whitehorse.\n\nIn 1950 the city was incorporated and by 1951, the population had doubled from its 1941 numbers. On April 1, 1953, the city was designated the capital of the Yukon Territory when the seat was moved from [[Dawson City]] after the construction of the [[Klondike Highway]].<ref name=\"Traveller's Guide\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.visitwhitehorse.com/\n |title=The Whitehorse Interactive Traveller's Guide\n |accessdate=2006-07-03\n |pages=History\u2013>Facts\u2013>Whitehorse\u2013>The Name \"Whitehorse\"}}</ref> On March 21, 1957, the name was officially changed from White Horse to Whitehorse.<ref name=\"ref1\">Robert G.

to Whitehorse's unique urban development objectives and varied topography, neighbourhoods are usually separated from each other by large geographical features. In addition to the city's [[Downtown Whitehorse|downtown]] core on the [[Yukon River]]'s west bank, two subdivisions sit at the same elevation as the [[Yukon River]] ({{cvt|640|m||}}). Crossing the bridge to the east bank of the river leads to [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]], one of the city's oldest neighbourhoods. From Riverdale, the road climbing up Grey Mountain leads to Grey Mountain Cemetery and the local FM radio antenna.<ref>{{cite news|title=CBC AM transmitter gets three years' grace|url=http://whitehorsestar.com/archive/story/cbc-am-transmitter-gets-three-years-grace/|accessdate=2011-03-26|newspaper=[[Whitehorse Star]]|date=14 July 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Northern Lights (6879315371).jpg|thumb|left|An [[aurora]] over a residential neighbourhood of [[Riverdale, Yukon|Riverdale]].

Situated further north are Range Point, Porter Creek, and Crestview, as well as Whitehorse's newest neighbourhood, Whistle Bend, where most of the new residential growth is currently occurring.\n\nWest of downtown are Valleyview, Hillcrest (also largely constituted of old military lodgings) and the Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport; and beyond the [[Canada Games Centre]] along Hamilton Boulevard are the neighbourhoods of McIntyre (designated to replace inferior lands and homes of the Kwanlin Dun First Nation (\"The Village\") previously located where Marwell adjoins a marshy area), then Ingram, Arkell, Logan, Granger, and rapidly expanding Copper Ridge.\n\nWhitehorse also has subdivisions designated \"Country Residential\" which are subject to different municipal bylaws and are located farther out from the downtown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Animal FAQ|url=http://www.city.whitehorse.yk.ca/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={ED5E5AB3-9730-489F-8234-4AEB5333001E}|work=Bylaw Services|publisher=City of Whitehorse|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> They consist of the rural Whitehorse subdivisions of Hidden Valley and MacPherson at Whitehorse's northern limits; to the south: McCrae (also spelt MacRae), Wolf Creek, Wolf Creek North, Mary Lake, Cowley Creek, Spruce Hill, Pineridge and Fox Haven Estates.<ref>{{cite web|title=try Residential \u2013 Whitehorse|url=http://www.sewp.gov.yk.ca/region?regionId=YK.WH.CNTRYRES|work=Socio-Economic Web Portal|publisher=\u00a9 Yukon Bureau of Statistics|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> Also located at the south end of the city is the newly designated Mt.

In 1973, the show was moved to the new Bonanza Room at the Whitehorse Travelodge. By 1975, its popularity had grown to such an extent that it became necessary to present two performances per night. In 1975 and again in 1977, the show embarked on cross-Canada tours, on which they performed everywhere from maximum security prisons to the Parliament Buildings in Ottawa. Twice the show travelled to Alert, the Canadian Forces Station five hundred miles from the North Pole.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nIn 1976, the Company undertook to produce not only the Whitehorse show, but the entertainment in Dawson City's Palace Grand Theatre and Diamond Tooth Gertie's Gambling Casino.

The first, Station #1, located in the city centre at the corner of Second Avenue and Steele Street, and Station #2 (305 B Range Road) atop \"Two Mile Hill\" on the west side, with room for three trucks. It was built in 2010 to become a public safety building.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fire Department|url=http://www.city.whitehorse.yk.ca/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC={9ED97345-C9A7-4607-893C-117F689D6B8E}|work=City Departments|publisher=City of Whitehorse|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fire Department Background|url=http://www.city.whitehorse.yk.ca/vertical/Sites/%7B77FF5155-2407-453B-BAE8-67D8813B88C6%7D/uploads/%7BB40BE8DD-EA04-469B-8198-EA4C2D83FAF3%7D.PDF|work=APPLICANT INFORMATION PACKAGE|publisher=City of Whitehorse|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> The original fire hall located along on the waterfront has been preserved as a historic building and cultural centre. The Fire Department currently operates with thirty-three full-time staff and approximately ten volunteers. Both fire stations are staffed 24/7 through a rotation of four platoons of six firefighters and one dispatcher.\n\nWHFD is equipped and trained to respond to Motor vehicle Accidents, high and low angle rescue, confined space, and static water ice rescue. Haz-mat, swift water and urban search and rescue are not under the departments current capabilities or can only be responded to at awareness levels.  All medical emergencies are responded to by Yukon Government Emergency Medical Services.  All aircraft emergencies are dealt with by the Eric Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport(ENWIA) ARFF fire department with mutual aid agreement activities from WHFD.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whitehorse.ca|title=Whitehorse, YT : Home|website=www.whitehorse.ca|access-date=2016-06-08}}</ref>  Whitehorse Fire Department is professionally represented by the [[International Association of Fire Fighters|IAFF and the BCPFFA]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iaff.org|title=Welcome to the IAFF Website|website=www.iaff.org|access-date=2016-06-08}}</ref>\n\nWhitehorse Fire Department is the largest municipal fire department in the territory and the only professional one.  Though they are 13% of the total population of firefighters in the territory, WHFD protects 82% of the population, and responds to 84% of fire calls within the Yukon.  WHFD falls under the authority of the Yukon Fire Marshals Office  (FMO) and reports directly to it.  Fire and life safety inspection throughout the City of Whitehorse are conducted by the Whitehorse Fire Department duty crews as well as designated Fire Prevention Officers under the direction of Municipal Bylaw 2000-01 \"Emergency Services Bylaw\" with authority from the current edition of the National Fire Code of Canada.\n\nWildland fire crews also operate in the summer to combat the forest fires across the territory. They will lend assistance to crews in B.C., Alberta, and the other territories as needed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Energy grid===\n[[Yukon Energy]] operates four conventional hydroelectric generating stations: Whitehorse Dam (40 MW), Aishihik Lake (37 MW), Mayo A (5 MW), and Mayo B (10 MW), which provide the bulk of generation for the Yukon Energy grid. An additional 39 MW of diesel generation is maintained for supplemental back-up.<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Facilities|url=http://www.yukonenergy.ca/energy/facilities/|publisher=Yukon Energy|accessdate=2012-12-31}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Yukon Energy operates two wind turbines near Whitehorse, which are connected to the Whitehorse-Aishihik-Faro grid. The first turbine is a Bonus Energy 150&nbsp;kW MARK III installed in 1993 that is no longer functional. The second turbine, a [[Vestas]] 660&nbsp;kW V47 LT II was later installed in 2000 and operates only in the summer. These units need to be specially adapted to deal with icing and the northern environment.<ref>[http://www.yukonenergy.ca/ Yukon Energy]. Yukonenergy.ca.

During WWI beds increased to 30, 10 beds were added in 1943, then 20 beds in 1949, and an operating wing was added in 1951. In 1959 the hospital was rebuilt on the other bank of the Yukon River, across from its previous location, but decision making was still based in Ottawa (National Health and Welfare, Medical Services Branch).<ref>{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.whitehorsehospital.ca/wghabout/history/|work=About Us|publisher=Yukon Hospital Corporation|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> The downtown area has several private medical, dental, and optometry clinics.\n\nIn 1990, the Yukon Hospital Corporation (YHC) was created in order to prepare the transfer of powers regarding the hospital from the Federal Government to the Yukon Territorial Government. In April 1993 management of WGH was officially transferred to the YHC following a collaboration with the Yukon government and Council of Yukon First Nations (CYFN, then CYI). Construction of the present building lasted from 1994 through 1997. Today Whitehorse General hospital counts 49 in-patient beds, 10 day-surgery beds, an ER department, OR suites and several medical imaging technologies.\n\n===Transportation===\n====Air====\nWhitehorse is served by the [[Erik Nielsen Whitehorse International Airport]] and has scheduled service to [[Vancouver]], [[Kelowna]], [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]], [[Yellowknife]], [[Ottawa]] (via [[Yellowknife]]), [[Dawson City]], [[Mayo, Yukon|Mayo]], [[Old Crow, Yukon|Old Crow]], [[Inuvik]], as well as  [[Frankfurt]], Germany during the summer months. The airport was developed as part of the Northwest Staging Route in 1941\u201342 and has two long paved runways. A wartime-era hangar served as terminal building from about 1960, and was replaced in December 1985 with a modern terminal. [[Air North]], a scheduled passenger and cargo airline operating [[Boeing 737]] jetliners and [[Hawker Siddeley 748]] turboprops, is based in Whitehorse.<ref>{{cite web |title=Air North, Yukon's Airline |url=https://www.flyairnorth.com/default.aspx |website=www.flyairnorth.com}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998 work was completed on a {{convert|340|m|abbr=on}} runway extension and other improvements (concrete turn button, installation of storm and sanitary mains, lighting upgrades, tower access road and blast pad).<ref>{{cite web|title=Whitehorse International Airport Runway Extension|url=http://www.yes-group.ca/index.php/Transportation/view_project/airport_runway_extension/|publisher=YES Group|accessdate=2011-03-26}}</ref> Expansion of the terminal itself was completed in 2010.\n[[File:Alaska Highway Bridge.jpg|thumb|Bridge of the [[Alaska Highway]] crossing over the [[Teslin River]] at [[Johnsons Crossing]]]]\n\n====Roads====\nSurface access to Whitehorse is provided by a network of highways, including the international [[Alaska Highway]] connecting the Yukon with Alaska, British Columbia, and [[Alberta]] highway networks.\n\nWhitehorse has been described as \"pearls on a string\", with its residential, industrial, and service subdivisions located along the main thoroughfares that carry traffic within city limits, with large gaps of undeveloped (often hilly) land between them. The [[Alaska Highway]] is the primary roadway, with branch roads reaching additional subdivisions. One such branch road, signed as \"Highway 1A\" and following Two Mile Hill Road, 4th Avenue, 2nd Avenue, and Robert Service Way, is the main access to downtown, Riverdale, and the Marwell Industrial Area. Other branch roads (Range Road, Hamilton Boulevard, Mayo Road) access smaller residential areas and recreational facilities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nThe city [[Arterial roads in Whitehorse, Yukon|road]] network is adequate, although it is congested during rush hours and discussions occasionally occur as to how it might better be managed, such as designating one-way streets.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Public transit====\n[[File:Trolley with flags (7041438277).jpg|thumb|The [[Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley]] was a [[heritage streetcar]] service that operated from 2000 to 2018.]]\n[[Whitehorse Transit]] provides bus service on weekdays from morning until early evening and Saturdays during business hours.\n\n{{main|Whitehorse Waterfront Trolley}}\nThere was a waterfront tram, known as [[Whitehorse trolley|the \"trolley\"]], which provided transport along a short rail section along the Yukon River; it was chiefly tourist-oriented and is not integrated into the municipal transit system. It runs from the Rotary Peace Park, located on the south end of the city centre, up to the north end of the city centre at Spook Creek Station. Whitehorse presently has no active railway service. The trolley system runs on a small portion of the tracks formerly belonging to [[White Pass and Yukon Route]].\n\nThe last scheduled service to Whitehorse from White Pass Railway occurred in October 1982. The White Pass Railway started scheduled service from [[Skagway, Alaska]] to [[Carcross, Yukon|Carcross]], {{convert|72|km|abbr=on}} south of Whitehorse, in the spring of 2007, but this was disrupted by high lake water levels in August 2007. Speculation of a transcontinental rail link to Alaska includes one possible route option through Whitehorse; a report has recommended a hub at [[Carmacks, Yukon|Carmacks]], with a spur line to Whitehorse and on to the Inside Passage of Alaska.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n====Water====\nThe Yukon River is essentially navigable from Whitehorse to the [[Bering Sea]]. At {{convert|640|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, the river at Whitehorse is the [[Extreme points of Earth#Highest attainable by transportation|highest point on earth]] that can be reached by watercraft navigating from the sea. Currently, no passenger or freight services use the river at Whitehorse.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n===Other services===\nWater disposal is mostly done by draining in a septic tank where the sewage is not that well developed. Waste is disposed mostly in areas requiring reclamation.
