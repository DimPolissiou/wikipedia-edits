{"title_page": "Bra\u2013ket notation", "text_new": "{{Quantum mechanics|cTopic=Background}}\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], '''bra\u2013ket notation''' is a common notation for [[quantum state]]s, i.e. vectors in a complex [[Hilbert space]] on which an algebra of observables acts. More generally the notation uses the [[angle bracket]]s (the \u27e8 and \u27e9 symbols) and a [[vertical bar]] (the | symbol), for a '''ket''' {{IPAc-en|k|\u025b|t}} (for example,  <math>|v \\rangle</math> ) to denote a [[vector space|vector]] in an abstract (usually complex) [[vector space]] <math>V</math> and a '''bra''', {{IPAc-en|b|r|\u0251\u02d0}} (for example,  <math>\\langle f|</math> ) to denote a [[linear functional]] on <math>V</math>, i.e. a co-vector, an element of the [[dual vector space]] <math> V^\\vee</math>. The natural pairing of a linear functional <math>f = \\langle f|</math> with a vector <math>v = |v\\rangle</math> is then written as <math>\\langle f| v\\rangle</math>.  On Hilbert spaces, the [[scalar product]] <math>(\\ , \\ )</math> (with anti linear first argument) gives an (anti-linear) identification of a vector ket <math>\\phi = |\\phi\\rangle</math> with a linear functional bra  <math>(\\phi, \\ ) = \\langle\\phi|</math>. Using this notation, the scalar product <math> (\\phi, \\psi) = \\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle</math>. \nFor the vector space <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>, kets can be identified with column vectors, and bras with row vectors. Combinations of bras, kets, and operators are interpreted using [[matrix multiplication]]. If <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math> has the standard hermitian inner product <math>(v, w) = v^\\dagger w</math>, under this identification, the identification of kets and bras and vice versa provided by the inner product is taking the hermitian conjugate <math> \\dagger</math>.\n\nIt is common to suppress the vector or functional from the bra\u2013ket notation and only use a label inside the typography for the bra or ket. For example, the spin operator <math>\\sigma_z</math> on a two dimensional space <math>\\Delta</math> of [[spinors]], has eigenvalues <math>\\pm \\frac12</math>  with eigen spinors <math>\\psi_+,\\psi_- \\in \\Delta</math>. In bra-ket notation one typically denotes this as <math>\\psi_+ = |+\\rangle</math>, and\n<math>\\psi_- = |-\\rangle</math>. Just as above, kets and  bras with the same label are interpreted as kets and bras corresponding to each other using the inner product. In particular when also identified with row and column vectors, kets and bras with the same label are identified with [[Hermitian conjugate]] column and row vectors. \n \nBra\u2013ket notation was effectively established in 1939 by [[Paul Dirac]]<ref name=\"Dirac\">{{harvnb|Dirac|1939}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shankar|1994|loc=Chapter 1}}</ref> and is thus also known as the '''Dirac notation'''.  (Still, the bra-ket notation has a precursor in [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s use of the notation <math>[\\phi{\\mid}\\psi]</math> for his inner products nearly 100 years earlier.<ref name=\"Grassmann\">{{harvnb|Grassmann|1862}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBRKw1Ab7E&t=2561 Lecture 2 | Quantum Entanglements, Part 1 (Stanford)], Leonard Susskind on complex numbers, complex conjugate, bra, ket. 2006-10-02.</ref>)\n\n==Introduction==\nBra\u2013ket notation is a notation for [[linear algebra]] and [[linear operator]]s  on [[complex vector space]]s together with their [[dual space]] both in the finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional case. It is specifically designed to ease the types of calculations that frequently come up in [[quantum mechanics]]. Its use in quantum mechanics is quite widespread. Many phenomena that are explained using quantum mechanics are explained using bra\u2013ket notation.\n\n==Vector spaces==\n\n===Vectors vs kets===\n\nIn mathematics, the term \"vector\" is used for an element of any vector space. In physics, however, the term \"vector\" is much more specific: \"vector\" refers almost exclusively to quantities like [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] or [[velocity]], which have components that relate directly to the three dimensions of space, or relativistically, to the four of space time. Such vectors are typically denoted with over arrows (<math>\\vec r</math>), boldface (<math>\\mathbf{p}</math>) or indices (<math>v^\\mu</math>).\n\nIn quantum mechanics, a [[quantum state]] is typically represented as an element of a complex Hilbert space, for example, the infinite-dimensional vector space of all possible [[wavefunction]]s (square integrable functions mapping each point of 3D space to a complex number) or some more abstract Hilbert space constructed more algebraically. Since the term \"vector\" is already used for something else (see previous paragraph), and physicists tend to prefer conventional notation to stating what space something is an element of, it is common and useful to denote an element <math>\\phi</math> of an abstract complex vector spaces as a  ket <math>|\\phi\\rangle</math> using vertical bars and angular brackets and refer to them as \"kets\" rather than as vectors and pronounced \"ket-<math>\\phi</math>\" or \"ket-A\" for {{math|{{ket|''A''}}}}. Symbols, letters, numbers, or even words\u2014whatever serves as a convenient label\u2014can be used as the label inside a ket, with the <math>|\\  \\rangle</math> making clear that the label indicates a vector in vector space. In other words, the symbol \"{{math|{{ket|''A''}}}}\" has a specific and universal mathematical meaning, while just the \"{{math|''A''}}\" by itself does not. For example, {{math|{{ket|1}} + {{ket|2}}}} might or might not be equal to {{math|{{ket|3}}}}. Nevertheless, for convenience, there is usually some logical scheme behind the labels inside kets, such as the common practice of labeling [[stationary state|energy eigenkets]] in quantum mechanics through a listing of their [[quantum number]]s.\n\nKet notation was invented by Paul Dirac <ref>{{cite book |title=Quantum Mechanics Demystified |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780071471411 |url-access=registration |first=D. |last=McMahon |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2006 |isbn=0-07-145546-9}}</ref>\n\n===Bra-Ket notation===\n\nSince kets are just vectors in a Hermitian vector space they can be manipulated using the usual rules of linear algebra, for example:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n|A \\rangle &= |B\\rangle + |C\\rangle \\\\\n|C \\rangle &= (-1+2i)|D \\rangle \\\\\n|D \\rangle &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} |x\\rangle \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\,.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNote how the last line above involves infinitely many different kets, one for each real number {{math|''x''}}.\n\nIf the ket is an element of a vector space, a '''bra''' <math>\\langle A|</math> is an element of its [[dual space]], i.e. a bra is a linear functional which is a linear map from the vector space to the complex numbers. Thus, it is useful to think of kets and bras as being elements of different vector spaces (see below however) with both being different useful concepts.\n\nA bra <math>\\langle\\phi|</math> and a ket <math> |\\psi\\rangle</math> (i.e. a functional and a vector), can be combined to an operator <math>|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|</math> of rank one with [[outer product]]\n\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\phi| : |\\xi\\rangle \\mapsto |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|\\xi\\rangle ~.</math>\n\n===Inner product and bra-ket identification on Hilbert space===\n{{main|Inner product}}\n\nThe bra-ket notation is particularly useful in Hilbert spaces which have an [[inner product]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBRKw1Ab7E&t=2834 Lecture 2 | Quantum Entanglements, Part 1 (Stanford)], Leonard Susskind on inner product, 2006-10-02.</ref> that allows [[Hermitian conjugation]] and identifying a vector with a linear functional, i.e. a ket with a bra, and vice versa (see [[Riesz representation theorem]]). The [[inner product]] on Hilbert space <math>(\\ , \\ )</math> (with the first argument anti linear as  preferred by physicists) is fully equivalent to an  (anti linear) identification between the space of kets and that of bras in the bra ket notation: for a vector ket <math>\\phi = |\\phi\\rangle </math> define a functional (i.e. bra) <math>f_\\phi = \\langle\\phi|</math> by\n\n:<math>(\\phi,\\psi) = (|\\phi\\rangle, |\\psi\\rangle) := f_\\phi(\\psi) = \\langle\\phi| \\,  \\bigl(|\\psi\\rangle\\bigr) = \\langle\\phi{\\mid}\\psi\\rangle </math>\n\n====Bras and kets as row and column vectors====\n\nIn the simple case where we consider the vector space <math>\\mathbf{C}^n</math>, a ket can be identified with a [[column vector]], and a bra as a [[row vector]]. If moreover we use the standard hermitian innerproduct on <math>\\mathbf{C}^n</math>, the bra corresponding to a ket, in particular a bra {{math|{{bra|''m''}}}} and a ket {{math|{{ket|''m''}}}} with the same label  are  [[conjugate transpose]]. Moreover, conventions are set up in such a way that writing bras, kets, and linear operators next to each other simply imply [[matrix multiplication]].<ref name=\"Bra-Ket Notation Trivializes Matrix Multiplication\">[http://algassert.com/post/1629 Gidney, Craig (2017). Bra\u2013Ket Notation Trivializes Matrix Multiplication]</ref> In particular the outer product <math>|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\phi| </math> of a column and a row vector ket and bra can be identified with matrix multiplication (column vector times  row vector equals matrix).\n\nFor a finite-dimensional vector space, using a fixed [[orthonormal basis]], the inner product can be written as a [[matrix multiplication]] of a row vector with a column vector:\n:<math> \\langle A | B \\rangle \\doteq A_1^* B_1 + A_2^* B_2 + \\cdots + A_N^* B_N =\n\\begin{pmatrix} A_1^* & A_2^* & \\cdots & A_N^* \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} B_1 \\\\ B_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ B_N \\end{pmatrix}</math>\nBased on this, the bras and kets can be defined as:\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\langle A | &\\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} A_1^* & A_2^* & \\cdots & A_N^* \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n| B \\rangle &\\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} B_1 \\\\ B_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ B_N \\end{pmatrix} \\end{align}</math>\nand then it is understood that a bra next to a ket implies [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nThe [[conjugate transpose]] (also called ''Hermitian conjugate'') of a bra is the corresponding ket and vice versa:\n:<math>\\langle A |^\\dagger = |A \\rangle, \\quad |A \\rangle^\\dagger = \\langle A |</math>\nbecause if one starts with the bra\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} A_1^* & A_2^* & \\cdots & A_N^* \\end{pmatrix} \\,,</math>\nthen performs a [[complex conjugation]], and then a [[matrix transpose]], one ends up with the ket\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} A_1 \\\\ A_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ A_N \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nWriting elements of a finite dimensional (or mutatis mutandis, countably infinite) vector space as  a column vector of numbers requires picking a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. Picking a basis is not always helpful because quantum mechanics calculations involve frequently switching between different bases (e.g. position basis, momentum basis, energy eigenbasis), and one can write something like \"{{math|{{ket|''m''}}}}\" without committing to any particular basis.   In situations involving two different important basis vectors,  the basis vectors can be taken in the notation explicitly and here  will be referred simply as \"{{math|{{ket|''&minus;''}}}}\" and \"{{math|{{ket|''+''}}}}\".\n\n=== Non-normalizable states and non-Hilbert spaces ===\n\nBra\u2013ket notation can be used even if the vector space is not a [[Hilbert space]].\n\nIn quantum mechanics, it is common practice to write down kets which have infinite [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], i.e. non-[[normalizable wavefunction]]s. Examples include states whose [[wavefunction]]s are [[Dirac delta function]]s or infinite [[plane wave]]s. These do not, technically, belong to the [[Hilbert space]] itself. However, the definition of \"Hilbert space\" can be broadened to accommodate these states (see the [[Gelfand\u2013Naimark\u2013Segal construction]] or [[rigged Hilbert space]]s). The bra\u2013ket notation continues to work in an analogous way in this broader context.\n\n[[Banach space]]s are a different generalization of Hilbert spaces. In a Banach space {{math|{{mathcal|B}}}}, the vectors may be notated by kets and the continuous [[linear functional]]s by bras. Over any vector space without [[topology]], we may also notate the vectors by kets and the linear functionals by bras. In these more general contexts, the bracket does not have the meaning of an inner product, because the Riesz representation theorem does not apply.\n\n==Usage in quantum mechanics==\n\nThe mathematical structure of [[quantum mechanics]] is based in large part on [[linear algebra]]:\n*[[Wave function]]s and other [[quantum state]]s can be represented as vectors in a complex [[Hilbert space]]. (The exact structure of this Hilbert space depends on the situation.) In bra\u2013ket notation, for example, an electron might be in the \"state\" {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}}. (Technically, the quantum states are ''[[ray (geometry)|ray]]s'' of vectors in the Hilbert space, as {{math|''c''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} corresponds to the same state for any nonzero complex number {{math|''c''}}.)\n*[[Quantum superposition]]s can be described as vector sums of the constituent states. For example, an electron in the state {{math|{{ket|1}} + ''i'' {{ket|2}}}} is in a quantum superposition of the states {{math|{{ket|1}}}} and {{math|{{ket|2}}}}.\n*[[Measurement in quantum mechanics|Measurements]] are associated with [[linear operator]]s (called [[observable]]s) on the Hilbert space of quantum states.\n*Dynamics are also described by linear operators on the Hilbert space. For example, in the [[Schr\u00f6dinger picture]], there is a linear [[time evolution]] operator {{math|''U''}} with the property that if an electron is in state {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} right now, at a later time it will be in the state {{math|''U''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}}, the same {{math|''U''}} for every possible {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}}.\n*[[Normalizable wave function|Wave function normalization]] is scaling a wave function so that its [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] is 1.\n\nSince virtually every calculation in quantum mechanics involves vectors and linear operators, it can involve, and often does involve, bra\u2013ket notation. A few examples follow:\n\n===Spinless position\u2013space wave function===\n  {{multiple image\n   | left\n   | footer    = Components of complex vectors plotted against index number; discrete {{math|''k''}} and continuous {{math|''x''}}.

This label is the eigenvalue of the position operator acting on such a basis state, <math> \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}|\\mathbf{r}\\rangle =   \\mathbf{r}|\\mathbf{r}\\rangle </math>.  Since there are an [[uncountably infinite]] number of vector components in the basis, this is an uncountably infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The dimensions of the Hilbert space (usually infinite) and position space (usually 1, 2 or 3) are not to be conflated.\n\nStarting from any ket {{math|{{ket|\u03a8}}}} in this Hilbert space,  one may ''define'' a complex scalar function of {{math|'''r'''}}, known as a [[wavefunction]],\n:<math>\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\ \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\ \\lang \\mathbf{r}|\\Psi\\rang \\,.</math>\n\nOn the left-hand side, {{math|\u03a8('''r''')}} is a function mapping any point in space to a complex number; on the right-hand side, {{math|{{ket|\u03a8}} {{=}} \u222b d<sup>3</sup>'''r''' \u03a8('''r''') {{ket|'''r'''}}}} is a ket consisting of a superposition of kets with relative coefficients specified by that function.\n\nIt is then customary to define linear operators acting on wavefunctions in terms of linear operators acting on kets, by\n:<math>\\hat A \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\ \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\ \\lang \\mathbf{r}|\\hat A|\\Psi\\rang \\,.</math>\n\nFor instance, the [[momentum]] operator <math>\\hat \\mathbf {p}</math>   has the following form,\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf{p} }\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\ \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\ \\lang \\mathbf{r} |\\hat \\mathbf{p}|\\Psi\\rang = - i \\hbar \\nabla \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\,.</math>\n\nOne occasionally encounters an expression such as\n:<math>\\nabla |\\Psi\\rang \\,,</math>\nthough this is something of an [[abuse of notation]]. The differential operator must be understood to be an abstract operator, acting on kets, that has the effect of differentiating wavefunctions once the expression is projected onto the position basis, <math>\\nabla \\lang\\mathbf{r}|\\Psi\\rang \\,,</math>\neven though, in the momentum basis, this operator amounts to a mere multiplication operator (by {{math|''i\u0127'''''p'''}}).  That is, to say,\n:<math>  \\langle \\mathbf{r} |\\hat \\mathbf{p}   =  - i \\hbar \\nabla \\langle \\mathbf{r}| ~,</math>\nor\n:<math>  \\hat \\mathbf{p}   =  \\int d^3 \\mathbf{r} ~| \\mathbf{r}\\rangle (  - i \\hbar \\nabla) \\langle \\mathbf{r}| ~.</math>\n\n===Overlap of states===\nIn quantum mechanics the expression {{math|{{bra-ket|''\u03c6''|''\u03c8''}}}} is typically interpreted as the [[probability amplitude]] for the state {{math|''\u03c8''}} to [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] into the state {{math|''\u03c6''}}. Mathematically, this means the coefficient for the projection of {{math|''\u03c8''}} onto {{math|''\u03c6''}}.  It is also described as the projection of state {{math|''\u03c8''}} onto state {{math|''\u03c6''}}.\n\n===Changing basis for a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle===\nA stationary [[spin-\u00bd|spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}]] particle has a two-dimensional Hilbert space. One [[orthonormal basis]] is:\n:<math>|{\\uparrow}_z \\rangle \\,, \\; |{\\downarrow}_z \\rangle</math>\nwhere {{math|{{ket|\u2191<sub>''z''</sub>}}}} is the state with a definite value of the [[angular momentum operator|spin operator {{math|''S<sub>z</sub>''}}]] equal to +{{sfrac|1|2}} and  {{math|{{ket|\u2193<sub>''z''</sub>}}}} is the state with a definite value of the [[angular momentum operator|spin operator {{math|''S<sub>z</sub>''}}]] equal to \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}.\n\nSince these are a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], ''any'' [[quantum state]] of the particle can be expressed as a [[linear combination]] (i.e., [[quantum superposition]]) of these two states:\n:<math>|\\psi \\rangle = a_{\\psi} |{\\uparrow}_z \\rangle + b_{\\psi} |{\\downarrow}_z \\rangle</math>\nwhere {{math|''a<sub>\u03c8</sub>''}} and {{math|''b<sub>\u03c8</sub>''}} are complex numbers.\n\nA ''different'' basis for the same Hilbert space is:\n:<math>|{\\uparrow}_x \\rangle \\,, \\; |{\\downarrow}_x \\rangle</math>\ndefined in terms of {{math|''S<sub>x</sub>''}} rather than {{math|''S<sub>z</sub>''}}.\n\nAgain, ''any'' state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination of these two:\n:<math>|\\psi \\rangle = c_{\\psi} |{\\uparrow}_x \\rangle + d_{\\psi} |{\\downarrow}_x \\rangle</math>\n\nIn vector form, you might write\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle \\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} a_\\psi \\\\ b_\\psi \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad |\\psi\\rangle \\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} c_\\psi \\\\ d_\\psi \\end{pmatrix} </math>\ndepending on which basis you are using. In other words, the \"coordinates\" of a vector depend on the basis used.\n\nThere is a mathematical relationship between {{math|''a''<sub>\u03c8</sub>}}, {{math|''b''<sub>\u03c8</sub>}}, {{math|''c''<sub>\u03c8</sub>}} and {{math|''d''<sub>\u03c8</sub>}}; see [[change of basis]].\n\n===Misleading uses===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\n\nThere are a few conventions and abuses of notation that are generally accepted by the physics community, but which might confuse the non-initiated.\n\nIt is common to use the same symbol for ''labels'' and ''constants'' in the same equation. For example, {{math|''\u03b1\u0302'' {{ket|''\u03b1''}} {{=}} ''\u03b1'' {{ket|''\u03b1''}}}}, where the symbol {{math|''\u03b1''}} is used '''simultaneously''' as the ''name of the operator'' {{math|''\u03b1\u0302''}}, its ''eigenvector'' {{math|{{ket|''\u03b1''}}}} and the associated ''eigenvalue'' {{math|''\u03b1''}}.\n\nSomething similar occurs in component notation of vectors. While {{math|''\u03a8''}} (uppercase) is traditionally associated with wavefunctions, {{math|''\u03c8''}} (lowercase) may be used to denote a ''label'', a ''wave function'' or ''complex constant'' in the same context, usually differentiated only by a subscript.\n\nThe main abuses are including operations inside the vector labels. This is done for a fast notation of scaling vectors. E.g. if the vector {{math|{{ket|''\u03b1''}}}} is scaled by {{sqrt|2}}, it might be denoted by {{math|{{ket|''\u03b1''/{{sqrt|2}}}}}}, which makes no sense since {{math|''\u03b1''}} is a label, not a function or a number, so you can't perform operations on it.\n\nThis is especially common when denoting vectors as tensor products, where part of the labels are moved '''outside''' the designed slot, e.g. {{math|{{ket|''\u03b1''}} {{=}} {{ket|''\u03b1''/{{sqrt|2}}<sub>1</sub>}} \u2297 {{ket|''\u03b1''/{{sqrt|2}}<sub>2</sub>}}}}. Here part of the labeling that should state that all three vectors are different was moved outside the kets, as subscripts 1 and 2. And a further abuse occurs, since {{math|''\u03b1''}} is meant to refer to the norm of the first vector\u2014which is a ''label'' denoting a ''value''.\n\n==Linear operators==\n{{see also|Linear operator}}\n\n===Linear operators acting on kets===\n\nA [[linear operator]] is a map that inputs a ket and outputs a ket. (In order to be called \"linear\", it is required to have [[linear operator|certain properties]].) In other words, if {{math|'''''A'''''}} is a linear operator and {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is a ket, then {{math|'''''A'''''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is another ket.\n\nIn an {{math|''N''}}-dimensional Hilbert space, {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} can be written as an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 1}} [[column vector]], and then {{math|'''''A'''''}} is an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 ''N''}} matrix with complex entries. The ket {{math|'''''A'''''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} can be computed by normal [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nLinear operators are ubiquitous in the theory of quantum mechanics. For example, observable physical quantities are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s, such as [[energy]] or [[momentum]], whereas transformative processes are represented by [[unitary operator|unitary]] linear operators such as rotation or the progression of time.\n\n===Linear operators acting on bras===\n\nOperators can also be viewed as acting on bras ''from the right hand side''. Specifically, if {{math|'''''A'''''}} is a linear operator and {{math|{{bra|''\u03c6''}}}} is a bra, then {{math|{{bra|''\u03c6''}}'''''A'''''}} is another bra defined by the rule\n\n:<math>\\bigl(\\langle\\phi|\\boldsymbol{A}\\bigr) |\\psi\\rangle = \\langle\\phi| \\bigl(\\boldsymbol{A}|\\psi\\rangle\\bigr) \\,,</math>\n\n(in other words, a [[function composition]]). This expression is commonly written as (cf. [[energy inner product]])\n\n:<math>\\langle\\phi|\\boldsymbol{A}|\\psi\\rangle \\,.</math>\n\nIn an {{math|''N''}}-dimensional Hilbert space, {{math|{{bra|''\u03c6''}}}} can be written as a {{math|1 \u00d7 ''N''}} [[row vector]], and {{math|'''''A'''''}} (as in the previous section) is an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 ''N''}} matrix. Then the bra {{math|{{bra|''\u03c6''}}'''''A'''''}} can be computed by normal [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nIf the same state vector appears on both bra and ket side,\n:<math>\\langle\\psi|\\boldsymbol{A}|\\psi\\rangle \\,,</math>\nthen this expression gives the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]], or mean or average value, of the observable represented by operator {{math|'''''A'''''}} for the physical system in the state {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}}.\n\n===Outer products===\n\nA convenient way to define linear operators on a Hilbert space {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}} is given by the [[outer product]]: if {{math|{{bra|''\u03d5''}}}} is a bra and {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is a ket, the outer product\n:<math> |\\phi\\rang \\, \\lang \\psi| </math>\ndenotes the [[finite-rank operator|rank-one operator]] with the rule \n:<math> \\bigl(|\\phi\\rang \\lang \\psi|\\bigr)(x) = \\lang \\psi | x \\rang |\\phi \\rang</math>.\n\nFor a finite-dimensional vector space, the outer product can be understood as simple matrix multiplication:\n:<math> |\\phi \\rangle \\, \\langle \\psi | \\doteq \n\\begin{pmatrix} \\phi_1 \\\\ \\phi_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\phi_N \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\psi_1^* & \\psi_2^* & \\cdots & \\psi_N^* \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\phi_1 \\psi_1^* & \\phi_1 \\psi_2^* & \\cdots & \\phi_1 \\psi_N^* \\\\\n\\phi_2 \\psi_1^* & \\phi_2 \\psi_2^* & \\cdots & \\phi_2 \\psi_N^* \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\phi_N \\psi_1^* & \\phi_N \\psi_2^* & \\cdots & \\phi_N \\psi_N^* \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nThe outer product is an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 ''N''}} matrix, as expected for a linear operator.\n\nOne of the uses of the outer product is to construct [[projection operator]]s. Given a ket {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} of norm 1, the orthogonal projection onto the [[Linear subspace|subspace]] spanned by {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle \\, \\langle\\psi| \\,.</math>\n\n===Hermitian conjugate operator===\n{{main|Hermitian conjugate}}\nJust as kets and bras can be transformed into each other (making {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} into {{math|{{bra|''\u03c8''}}}}), the element from the dual space corresponding to {{math|''A''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is {{math|{{bra|''\u03c8''}}''A''<sup>\u2020</sup>}},  where {{math|''A''<sup>\u2020</sup>}} denotes the [[Hermitian conjugate]] (or adjoint) of the operator {{math|''A''}}. In other words,\n:<math> |\\phi\\rangle = A |\\psi\\rangle \\quad \\text{if and only if} \\quad \\langle\\phi| = \\langle \\psi | A^\\dagger \\,.</math>\n\nIf {{math|''A''}} is expressed as an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 ''N''}} matrix, then {{math|''A''<sup>\u2020</sup>}} is its [[conjugate transpose]].\n\n[[Self-adjoint]] operators, where {{math|''A'' {{=}} ''A''<sup>\u2020</sup>}}, play an important role in quantum mechanics; for example, an [[observable]] is always described by a self-adjoint operator. If {{mvar|A}} is a self-adjoint operator, then {{math|{{bra|''\u03c8''}}''A''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is always a real number (not complex). This implies that [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation values]] of observables are real.\n\n==Properties==\nBra\u2013ket notation was designed to facilitate the formal manipulation of linear-algebraic expressions. Some of the properties that allow this manipulation are listed herein. In what follows, {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''c''<sub>2</sub>}} denote arbitrary [[complex number]]s, {{math|''c''*}} denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} denote arbitrary linear operators, and these properties are to hold for any choice of bras and kets.\n\n===Linearity===\n* Since bras are linear functionals,\n\n::<math>\\langle\\phi| \\bigl( c_1|\\psi_1\\rangle + c_2|\\psi_2\\rangle \\bigr) = c_1\\langle\\phi|\\psi_1\\rangle + c_2\\langle\\phi|\\psi_2\\rangle \\,. </math>\n\n* By the definition of addition and scalar multiplication of linear functionals in the [[dual space]],<ref>[http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1112/notes/hilbert.pdf Lecture notes by Robert Littlejohn], eqns 12 and 13</ref>\n\n::<math>\\bigl(c_1 \\langle\\phi_1| + c_2 \\langle\\phi_2|\\bigr) |\\psi\\rangle = c_1 \\langle\\phi_1|\\psi\\rangle + c_2 \\langle\\phi_2|\\psi\\rangle \\,. </math>\n\n===Associativity===\nGiven any expression involving complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators (but not addition), written in bra\u2013ket notation, the parenthetical groupings do not matter (i.e., the [[associative property]] holds). For example:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\lang \\psi| \\bigl(A |\\phi\\rang\\bigr) = \\bigl(\\lang \\psi|A\\bigr)|\\phi\\rang \\, &\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\, \\lang \\psi | A | \\phi \\rang \\\\\n\\bigl(A|\\psi\\rang\\bigr)\\lang \\phi| = A\\bigl(|\\psi\\rang \\lang \\phi|\\bigr) \\, &\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\, A | \\psi \\rang \\lang \\phi |\n\\end{align}</math>\nand so forth. The expressions on the right (with no parentheses whatsoever) are allowed to be written unambiguously ''because'' of the equalities on the left. Note that the associative property does ''not'' hold for expressions that include nonlinear operators, such as the [[antilinear]] [[T-symmetry|time reversal operator]] in physics.\n\n===Hermitian conjugation===\nBra\u2013ket notation makes it particularly easy to compute the Hermitian conjugate (also called ''dagger'', and denoted {{math|\u2020}}) of expressions. The formal rules are:\n* The Hermitian conjugate of a bra is the corresponding ket, and vice versa.\n* The Hermitian conjugate of a complex number is its complex conjugate.\n* The Hermitian conjugate of the Hermitian conjugate of anything (linear operators, bras, kets, numbers) is itself\u2014i.e.,\n::<math>\\left(x^\\dagger\\right)^\\dagger=x \\,.</math>\n* Given any combination of complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators, written in bra\u2013ket notation, its Hermitian conjugate can be computed by reversing the order of the components, and taking the Hermitian conjugate of each.\n\nThese rules are sufficient to formally write the Hermitian conjugate of any such expression; some examples are as follows:\n* Kets:\n::<math>\n\\bigl(c_1|\\psi_1\\rangle + c_2|\\psi_2\\rangle\\bigr)^\\dagger = c_1^* \\langle\\psi_1| + c_2^* \\langle\\psi_2| \\,.\n</math>\n* Inner products:\n::<math>\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle^* = \\langle \\psi|\\phi\\rangle \\,.</math>\n\n:Note that {{math|{{bra-ket|''\u03c6''|''\u03c8''}}}} is a scalar, so the Hermitian conjugate is just the complex conjugate, i.e.\n::<math>\\bigl(\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle\\bigr)^\\dagger = \\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle^*</math>\n* Matrix elements:\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle \\phi| A | \\psi \\rangle^* &= \\left\\langle \\psi \\left| A^\\dagger \\right|\\phi \\right\\rangle \\\\\n\\left\\langle \\phi\\left| A^\\dagger B^\\dagger \\right| \\psi \\right\\rangle^* &= \\langle \\psi | BA |\\phi \\rangle \\,.\n\\end{align}</math>\n* Outer products:\n::<math>\\Big(\\bigl(c_1|\\phi_1\\rangle\\langle \\psi_1|\\bigr) + \\bigl(c_2|\\phi_2\\rangle\\langle\\psi_2|\\bigr)\\Big)^\\dagger = \\bigl(c_1^* |\\psi_1\\rangle\\langle \\phi_1|\\bigr) + \\bigl(c_2^*|\\psi_2\\rangle\\langle\\phi_2|\\bigr) \\,.</math>\n\n==Composite bras and kets==\nTwo Hilbert spaces {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} may form a third space {{math|''V'' \u2297 ''W''}} by a [[tensor product]]. In quantum mechanics, this is used for describing composite systems. If a system is composed of two subsystems described in {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} respectively, then the Hilbert space of the entire system is the tensor product of the two spaces. (The exception to this is if the subsystems are actually [[identical particles]]. In that case, the situation is a little more complicated.)\n\nIf {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is a ket in {{math|''V''}} and {{math|{{ket|''\u03c6''}}}} is a ket in {{math|''W''}}, the direct product of the two kets is a ket in {{math|''V'' \u2297 ''W''}}. This is written in various notations:\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle|\\phi\\rangle \\,,\\quad |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |\\phi\\rangle\\,,\\quad|\\psi \\phi\\rangle\\,,\\quad|\\psi ,\\phi\\rangle\\,.</math>\n\nSee [[quantum entanglement#Quantum mechanical framework|quantum entanglement]] and the [[EPR paradox#Mathematical formulation|EPR paradox]] for applications of this product.\n\n==The unit operator==\nConsider a complete [[orthonormal]] system (''[[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]''),\n:<math>\\{ e_i \\ | \\ i \\in \\mathbb{N} \\} \\,,</math>\nfor a Hilbert space {{math|''H''}}, with respect to the norm from an inner product {{math|{{angbr|\u00b7,\u00b7}}}}.\n\nFrom basic [[functional analysis]], it is  known that any ket <math>|\\psi\\rangle </math> can also be written as\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\langle e_i | \\psi \\rangle | e_i \\rangle,</math>\nwith {{math|{{bra-ket|\u00b7|\u00b7}}}} the inner product on the Hilbert space.\n\nFrom the commutativity of kets with (complex) scalars, it follows that\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} | e_i \\rangle \\langle e_i | = \\mathbb{1}</math>\nmust be the ''identity operator'', which sends each vector to itself.\n\nThis, then,  can be inserted in any expression without affecting its value; for example\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle v | w \\rangle &= \\langle v | \\left( \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} | e_i \\rangle \\langle e_i| \\right) | w \\rangle \\\\\n                      &= \\langle v | \\left( \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} | e_i \\rangle \\langle e_i| \\right) \\left( \\sum_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}} | e_j \\rangle \\langle e_j |\\right)| w \\rangle \\\\\n&= \\langle v | e_i \\rangle \\langle e_i | e_j \\rangle \\langle e_j | w \\rangle \\,, \n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere, in the last line, the [[Einstein summation convention]] has been used to avoid clutter.\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], it often occurs that little or no information about the inner product {{math|{{bra-ket|''\u03c8''|''\u03c6''}}}} of two arbitrary (state) kets is present, while it is still possible to say something about the expansion coefficients {{math|{{bra-ket|''\u03c8''|''e<sub>i</sub>''}} {{=}} {{bra-ket|''e<sub>i</sub>''|''\u03c8''}}*}} and {{math|{{bra-ket|''e<sub>i</sub>''|''\u03c6''}}}} of those vectors with respect to a specific (orthonormalized) basis. In this case, it is particularly useful to insert the unit operator into the bracket one time or more.\n\nFor more information, see [[Resolution of the identity]], \n*   &nbsp; &nbsp; {{math|1 {{=}} \u222b d''x'' {{ket|''x''}}{{bra|''x''}} {{=}} \u222b d''p'' {{ket|''p''}}{{bra|''p''}}}},  where  {{math| {{ket|''p''}} {{=}} \u222b d''x'' ''e''<sup>''ixp''/''\u0127''</sup>{{ket|''x''}}/{{sqrt|2''\u03c0\u0127''}}}}.\n\nSince {{math|{{bra-ket|''x''\u2032|''x''}} {{=}} ''\u03b4''(''x'' \u2212 ''x''\u2032)}}, plane waves follow,<ref>In his book (1958), Ch.

What physicists would denote by {{math|{{ket|''h''}}}} is the vector itself. That is,\n\n:<math> |h\\rangle\\in \\mathcal{H} </math>.\n\nLet {{math|{{mathcal|H}}*}} be the [[dual space]] of {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}}. This is the space of linear functionals on {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}}. The isomorphism {{math|''\u03a6'' : {{mathcal|H}} \u2192 {{mathcal|H}}*}} is defined by {{math|''\u03a6''(''h'') {{=}} ''\u03c6<sub>h</sub>''}}, where for every {{math|''g'' \u2208 {{mathcal|H}}}} we define\n:<math> \\phi_h(g) = \\mbox{IP}(h,g) = (h,g) = \\langle h,g \\rangle = \\langle h|g \\rangle </math>,\nwhere {{math|IP(\u00b7,\u00b7)}}, {{math|(\u00b7,\u00b7)}}, {{math|{{angbr|\u00b7,\u00b7}}}} and {{math|{{bra-ket|\u00b7|\u00b7}}}} are just different notations for expressing an inner product between two elements in a Hilbert space (or for the first three, in any inner product space). Notational confusion arises when identifying {{math|''\u03c6<sub>h</sub>''}} and {{math|''g''}} with {{math|{{bra|''h''}}}} and {{math|{{ket|''g''}}}} respectively. This is because of literal symbolic substitutions. Let {{math|''\u03c6<sub>h</sub>'' {{=}} ''H'' {{=}} {{bra|''h''}}}} and let {{math|''g'' {{=}} G {{=}} {{ket|''g''}}}}. This gives\n\n:<math> \\phi_h(g) = H(g) = H(G)=\\langle h|(G) = \\langle h|\\bigl(|g\\rangle\\bigr) \\,. </math>\n\nOne ignores the parentheses and removes the double bars. Some properties of this notation are convenient since we are dealing with linear operators and composition acts like a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] multiplication.\n\nMoreover, mathematicians usually write the dual entity not at the first place, as the physicists do, but at the second one, and they usually use not an [[asterisk]] but an overline (which the physicists reserve for averages and the [[Dirac equation#Conservation of probability current|Dirac spinor adjoint]]) to denote [[complex conjugate]] numbers; i.e., for scalar products mathematicians usually write\n:<math>(\\phi ,\\psi )=\\int \\phi (x)\\cdot \\overline{\\psi(x)}\\, \\mathrm{d}x \\,,</math>\nwhereas physicists would write for the same quantity\n:<math> \\langle\\psi |\\phi \\rangle=\\int \\,\\psi^*(x)\\cdot\\phi(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x.</math>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics|Physics}}\n* [[Angular momentum diagrams (quantum mechanics)]]\n* [[N-slit interferometric equation|{{mvar|n}}-slit interferometric equation]]\n* [[Quantum state]]\n* [[Inner product]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal |last=Dirac |first=P.

More generally the notation uses the [[angle bracket]]s (the \u27e8 and \u27e9 symbols) and a [[vertical bar]] (the | symbol), for a '''ket''' {{IPAc-en|k|\u025b|t}} (for example,  <math>|v \\rangle</math> ) to denote a [[vector space|vector]] in an abstract (usually complex) [[vector space]] <math>V</math> and a '''bra''', {{IPAc-en|b|r|\u0251\u02d0}} (for example,  <math>\\langle f|</math> ) to denote a [[linear functional]] on <math>V</math>, i.e. a co-vector, an element of the [[dual vector space]] <math> V^\\vee</math>. The natural pairing of a linear functional <math>f = \\langle f|</math> with a vector <math>v = |v\\rangle</math> is then written as <math>\\langle f| v\\rangle</math>.  On Hilbert spaces, the [[scalar product]] <math>(\\ , \\ )</math> (with anti linear first argument) gives an (anti-linear) identification of a vector ket <math>\\phi = |\\phi\\rangle</math> with a linear functional bra  <math>(\\phi, \\ ) = \\langle\\phi|</math>. Using this notation, the scalar product <math> (\\phi, \\psi) = \\langle\\phi|\\psi\\rangle</math>. \nFor the vector space <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>, kets can be identified with column vectors, and bras with row vectors. Combinations of bras, kets, and operators are interpreted using [[matrix multiplication]]. If <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math> has the standard hermitian inner product <math>(v, w) = v^\\dagger w</math>, under this identification, the identification of kets and bras and vice versa provided by the inner product is taking the hermitian conjugate <math> \\dagger</math>.\n\nIt is common to suppress the vector or functional from the bra\u2013ket notation and only use a label inside the typography for the bra or ket. For example, the spin operator <math>\\sigma_z</math> on a two dimensional space <math>\\Delta</math> of [[spinors]], has eigenvalues <math>\\pm \\frac12</math>  with eigen spinors <math>\\psi_+,\\psi_- \\in \\Delta</math>. In bra-ket notation one typically denotes this as <math>\\psi_+ = |+\\rangle</math>, and\n<math>\\psi_- = |-\\rangle</math>. Just as above, kets and  bras with the same label are interpreted as kets and bras corresponding to each other using the inner product. In particular when also identified with row and column vectors, kets and bras with the same label are identified with [[Hermitian conjugate]] column and row vectors. \n \nBra\u2013ket notation was effectively established in 1939 by [[Paul Dirac]]<ref name=\"Dirac\">{{harvnb|Dirac|1939}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Shankar|1994|loc=Chapter 1}}</ref> and is thus also known as the '''Dirac notation'''.  (Still, the bra-ket notation has a precursor in [[Hermann Grassmann]]'s use of the notation <math>[\\phi{\\mid}\\psi]</math> for his inner products nearly 100 years earlier.<ref name=\"Grassmann\">{{harvnb|Grassmann|1862}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBRKw1Ab7E&t=2561 Lecture 2 | Quantum Entanglements, Part 1 (Stanford)], Leonard Susskind on complex numbers, complex conjugate, bra, ket. 2006-10-02.</ref>)\n\n==Introduction==\nBra\u2013ket notation is a notation for [[linear algebra]] and [[linear operator]]s  on [[complex vector space]]s together with their [[dual space]] both in the finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional case. It is specifically designed to ease the types of calculations that frequently come up in [[quantum mechanics]]. Its use in quantum mechanics is quite widespread. Many phenomena that are explained using quantum mechanics are explained using bra\u2013ket notation.\n\n==Vector spaces==\n\n===Vectors vs kets===\n\nIn mathematics, the term \"vector\" is used for an element of any vector space. In physics, however, the term \"vector\" is much more specific: \"vector\" refers almost exclusively to quantities like [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] or [[velocity]], which have components that relate directly to the three dimensions of space, or relativistically, to the four of space time. Such vectors are typically denoted with over arrows (<math>\\vec r</math>), boldface (<math>\\mathbf{p}</math>) or indices (<math>v^\\mu</math>).\n\nIn quantum mechanics, a [[quantum state]] is typically represented as an element of a complex Hilbert space, for example, the infinite-dimensional vector space of all possible [[wavefunction]]s (square integrable functions mapping each point of 3D space to a complex number) or some more abstract Hilbert space constructed more algebraically. Since the term \"vector\" is already used for something else (see previous paragraph), and physicists tend to prefer conventional notation to stating what space something is an element of, it is common and useful to denote an element <math>\\phi</math> of an abstract complex vector spaces as a  ket <math>|\\phi\\rangle</math> using vertical bars and angular brackets and refer to them as \"kets\" rather than as vectors and pronounced \"ket-<math>\\phi</math>\" or \"ket-A\" for {{math|{{ket|''A''}}}}. Symbols, letters, numbers, or even words\u2014whatever serves as a convenient label\u2014can be used as the label inside a ket, with the <math>|\\  \\rangle</math> making clear that the label indicates a vector in vector space. In other words, the symbol \"{{math|{{ket|''A''}}}}\" has a specific and universal mathematical meaning, while just the \"{{math|''A''}}\" by itself does not. For example, {{math|{{ket|1}} + {{ket|2}}}} might or might not be equal to {{math|{{ket|3}}}}. Nevertheless, for convenience, there is usually some logical scheme behind the labels inside kets, such as the common practice of labeling [[stationary state|energy eigenkets]] in quantum mechanics through a listing of their [[quantum number]]s.\n\nKet notation was invented by Paul Dirac <ref>{{cite book |title=Quantum Mechanics Demystified |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780071471411 |url-access=registration |first=D. |last=McMahon |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2006 |isbn=0-07-145546-9}}</ref>\n\n===Bra-Ket notation===\n\nSince kets are just vectors in a Hermetian vector space they can be manipulated using the usual rules of linear algebra, for example:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n|A \\rangle &= |B\\rangle + |C\\rangle \\\\\n|C \\rangle &= (-1+2i)|D \\rangle \\\\\n|D \\rangle &= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} e^{-x^2} |x\\rangle \\, \\mathrm{d}x \\,.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nNote how the last line above involves infinitely many different kets, one for each real number {{math|''x''}}.\n\nIf the ket is an element of a vector space, a '''bra''' <math>\\langle A|</math> is an element of its [[dual space]], i.e. a bra is a linear functional which is a linear map from the vector space to the complex numbers. Thus, it is useful to think of kets and bras as being elements of different vector spaces (see below however) with both being different useful concepts.\n\nA bra <math>\\langle\\phi|</math> and a ket <math> |\\psi\\rangle</math> (i.e. a functional and a vector), can be combined to an operator <math>|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|</math> of rank one with [[outer product]]\n\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\phi| : |\\xi\\rangle \\mapsto |\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\phi|\\xi\\rangle ~.</math>\n\n===Inner product and bra-ket identification on Hilbert space===\n{{main|Inner product}}\n\nThe bra-ket notation is particularly useful in Hilbert spaces which have an [[inner product]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtBRKw1Ab7E&t=2834 Lecture 2 | Quantum Entanglements, Part 1 (Stanford)], Leonard Susskind on inner product, 2006-10-02.</ref> that allows [[Hermitian conjugation]] and identifying a vector with a linear functional, i.e. a ket with a bra, and vice versa (see [[Riesz representation theorem]]). The [[inner product]] on Hilbert space <math>(\\ , \\ )</math> (with the first argument anti linear as  preferred by physicists) is fully equivalent to an  (anti linear) identification between the space of kets and that of bras in the bra ket notation: for a vector ket <math>\\phi = |\\phi\\rangle </math> define a functional (i.e. bra) <math>f_\\phi = \\langle\\phi|</math> by\n\n:<math>(\\phi,\\psi) = (|\\phi\\rangle, |\\psi\\rangle) := f_\\phi(\\psi) = \\langle\\phi| \\,  \\bigl(|\\psi\\rangle\\bigr) = \\langle\\phi{\\mid}\\psi\\rangle </math>\n\n====Bras and kets as row and column vectors====\n\nIn the simple case where we consider the vector space <math>\\mathbf{C}^n</math>, a ket can be identified with a [[column vector]], and a bra as a [[row vector]]. If moreover we use the standard hermitian innerproduct on <math>\\mathbf{C}^n</math>, the bra corresponding to a ket, in particular a bra {{math|{{bra|''m''}}}} and a ket {{math|{{ket|''m''}}}} with the same label  are  [[conjugate transpose]]. Moreover, conventions are set up in such a way that writing bras, kets, and linear operators next to each other simply imply [[matrix multiplication]].<ref name=\"Bra-Ket Notation Trivializes Matrix Multiplication\">[http://algassert.com/post/1629 Gidney, Craig (2017). Bra\u2013Ket Notation Trivializes Matrix Multiplication]</ref> In particular the outer product <math>|\\psi\\rangle\\langle\\phi| </math> of a column and a row vector ket and bra can be identified with matrix multiplication (column vector times  row vector equals matrix).\n\nFor a finite-dimensional vector space, using a fixed [[orthonormal basis]], the inner product can be written as a [[matrix multiplication]] of a row vector with a column vector:\n:<math> \\langle A | B \\rangle \\doteq A_1^* B_1 + A_2^* B_2 + \\cdots + A_N^* B_N =\n\\begin{pmatrix} A_1^* & A_2^* & \\cdots & A_N^* \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} B_1 \\\\ B_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ B_N \\end{pmatrix}</math>\nBased on this, the bras and kets can be defined as:\n:<math>\\begin{align} \\langle A | &\\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} A_1^* & A_2^* & \\cdots & A_N^* \\end{pmatrix} \\\\\n| B \\rangle &\\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} B_1 \\\\ B_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ B_N \\end{pmatrix} \\end{align}</math>\nand then it is understood that a bra next to a ket implies [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nThe [[conjugate transpose]] (also called ''Hermitian conjugate'') of a bra is the corresponding ket and vice versa:\n:<math>\\langle A |^\\dagger = |A \\rangle, \\quad |A \\rangle^\\dagger = \\langle A |</math>\nbecause if one starts with the bra\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} A_1^* & A_2^* & \\cdots & A_N^* \\end{pmatrix} \\,,</math>\nthen performs a [[complex conjugation]], and then a [[matrix transpose]], one ends up with the ket\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix} A_1 \\\\ A_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ A_N \\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nWriting elements of a finite dimensional (or mutatis mutandis, countably infinite) vector space as  a column vector of numbers requires picking a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]]. Picking a basis is not always helpful because quantum mechanics calculations involve frequently switching between different bases (e.g. position basis, momentum basis, energy eigenbasis), and one can write something like \"{{math|{{ket|''m''}}}}\" without committing to any particular basis.   In situations involving two different important basis vectors,  the basis vectors can be taken in the notation explicitly and here  will be referred simply as \"{{math|{{ket|''&minus;''}}}}\" and \"{{math|{{ket|''+''}}}}\".\n\n=== Non-normalizable states and non-Hilbert spaces ===\n\nBra\u2013ket notation can be used even if the vector space is not a [[Hilbert space]].\n\nIn quantum mechanics, it is common practice to write down kets which have infinite [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], i.e. non-[[normalizable wavefunction]]s. Examples include states whose [[wavefunction]]s are [[Dirac delta function]]s or infinite [[plane wave]]s. These do not, technically, belong to the [[Hilbert space]] itself. However, the definition of \"Hilbert space\" can be broadened to accommodate these states (see the [[Gelfand\u2013Naimark\u2013Segal construction]] or [[rigged Hilbert space]]s). The bra\u2013ket notation continues to work in an analogous way in this broader context.\n\n[[Banach space]]s are a different generalization of Hilbert spaces. In a Banach space {{math|{{mathcal|B}}}}, the vectors may be notated by kets and the continuous [[linear functional]]s by bras. Over any vector space without [[topology]], we may also notate the vectors by kets and the linear functionals by bras. In these more general contexts, the bracket does not have the meaning of an inner product, because the Riesz representation theorem does not apply.\n\n==Usage in quantum mechanics==\n\nThe mathematical structure of [[quantum mechanics]] is based in large part on [[linear algebra]]:\n*[[Wave function]]s and other [[quantum state]]s can be represented as vectors in a complex [[Hilbert space]]. (The exact structure of this Hilbert space depends on the situation.) In bra\u2013ket notation, for example, an electron might be in the \"state\" {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}}. (Technically, the quantum states are ''[[ray (geometry)|ray]]s'' of vectors in the Hilbert space, as {{math|''c''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} corresponds to the same state for any nonzero complex number {{math|''c''}}.)\n*[[Quantum superposition]]s can be described as vector sums of the constituent states. For example, an electron in the state {{math|{{ket|1}} + ''i'' {{ket|2}}}} is in a quantum superposition of the states {{math|{{ket|1}}}} and {{math|{{ket|2}}}}.\n*[[Measurement in quantum mechanics|Measurements]] are associated with [[linear operator]]s (called [[observable]]s) on the Hilbert space of quantum states.\n*Dynamics are also described by linear operators on the Hilbert space. For example, in the [[Schr\u00f6dinger picture]], there is a linear [[time evolution]] operator {{math|''U''}} with the property that if an electron is in state {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} right now, at a later time it will be in the state {{math|''U''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}}, the same {{math|''U''}} for every possible {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}}.\n*[[Normalizable wave function|Wave function normalization]] is scaling a wave function so that its [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] is 1.\n\nSince virtually every calculation in quantum mechanics involves vectors and linear operators, it can involve, and often does involve, bra\u2013ket notation. A few examples follow:\n\n===Spinless position\u2013space wave function===\n  {{multiple image\n   | left\n   | footer    = Components of complex vectors plotted against index number; discrete {{math|''k''}} and continuous {{math|''x''}}.

This label is the eigenvalue of the position operator acting on such a basis state, <math> \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}|\\mathbf{r}\\rangle =   \\mathbf{r}|\\mathbf{r}\\rangle </math>.  Since there are an [[uncountably infinite]] number of vector components in the basis, this is an uncountably infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. The dimensions of the Hilbert space (usually infinite) and position space (usually 1, 2 or 3) are not to be conflated.\n\nStarting from any ket {{math|{{ket|\u03a8}}}} in this Hilbert space,  one may ''define'' a complex scalar function of {{math|'''r'''}}, known as a [[wavefunction]],\n:<math>\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\ \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\ \\lang \\mathbf{r}|\\Psi\\rang \\,.</math>\n\nOn the left-hand side, {{math|\u03a8('''r''')}} is a function mapping any point in space to a complex number; on the right-hand side, {{math|{{ket|\u03a8}} {{=}} \u222b d<sup>3</sup>'''r''' \u03a8('''r''') {{ket|'''r'''}}}} is a ket consisting of a superposition of kets with relative coefficients specified by that function.\n\nIt is then customary to define linear operators acting on wavefunctions in terms of linear operators acting on kets, by\n:<math>\\hat A \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\ \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\ \\lang \\mathbf{r}|\\hat A|\\Psi\\rang \\,.</math>\n\nFor instance, the [[momentum]] operator <math>\\hat \\mathbf {p}</math>   has the following form,\n:<math>\\hat{\\mathbf{p} }\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\ \\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=}\\ \\lang \\mathbf{r} |\\hat \\mathbf{p}|\\Psi\\rang = - i \\hbar \\nabla \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) \\,.</math>\n\nOne occasionally encounters an expression such as\n:<math>\\nabla |\\Psi\\rang \\,,</math>\nthough this is something of an [[abuse of notation]]. The differential operator must be understood to be an abstract operator, acting on kets, that has the effect of differentiating wavefunctions once the expression is projected onto the position basis, <math>\\nabla \\lang\\mathbf{r}|\\Psi\\rang \\,,</math>\neven though, in the momentum basis, this operator amounts to a mere multiplication operator (by {{math|''i\u0127'''''p'''}}).  That is, to say,\n:<math>  \\langle \\mathbf{r} |\\hat \\mathbf{p}   =  - i \\hbar \\nabla \\langle \\mathbf{r}| ~,</math>\nor\n:<math>  \\hat \\mathbf{p}   =  \\int d^3 \\mathbf{r} ~| \\mathbf{r}\\rangle (  - i \\hbar \\nabla) \\langle \\mathbf{r}| ~.</math>\n\n===Overlap of states===\nIn quantum mechanics the expression {{math|{{bra-ket|''\u03c6''|''\u03c8''}}}} is typically interpreted as the [[probability amplitude]] for the state {{math|''\u03c8''}} to [[wavefunction collapse|collapse]] into the state {{math|''\u03c6''}}. Mathematically, this means the coefficient for the projection of {{math|''\u03c8''}} onto {{math|''\u03c6''}}.  It is also described as the projection of state {{math|''\u03c8''}} onto state {{math|''\u03c6''}}.\n\n===Changing basis for a spin-{{sfrac|1|2}} particle===\nA stationary [[spin-\u00bd|spin-{{sfrac|1|2}}]] particle has a two-dimensional Hilbert space. One [[orthonormal basis]] is:\n:<math>|{\\uparrow}_z \\rangle \\,, \\; |{\\downarrow}_z \\rangle</math>\nwhere {{math|{{ket|\u2191<sub>''z''</sub>}}}} is the state with a definite value of the [[angular momentum operator|spin operator {{math|''S<sub>z</sub>''}}]] equal to +{{sfrac|1|2}} and  {{math|{{ket|\u2193<sub>''z''</sub>}}}} is the state with a definite value of the [[angular momentum operator|spin operator {{math|''S<sub>z</sub>''}}]] equal to \u2212{{sfrac|1|2}}.\n\nSince these are a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]], ''any'' [[quantum state]] of the particle can be expressed as a [[linear combination]] (i.e., [[quantum superposition]]) of these two states:\n:<math>|\\psi \\rangle = a_{\\psi} |{\\uparrow}_z \\rangle + b_{\\psi} |{\\downarrow}_z \\rangle</math>\nwhere {{math|''a<sub>\u03c8</sub>''}} and {{math|''b<sub>\u03c8</sub>''}} are complex numbers.\n\nA ''different'' basis for the same Hilbert space is:\n:<math>|{\\uparrow}_x \\rangle \\,, \\; |{\\downarrow}_x \\rangle</math>\ndefined in terms of {{math|''S<sub>x</sub>''}} rather than {{math|''S<sub>z</sub>''}}.\n\nAgain, ''any'' state of the particle can be expressed as a linear combination of these two:\n:<math>|\\psi \\rangle = c_{\\psi} |{\\uparrow}_x \\rangle + d_{\\psi} |{\\downarrow}_x \\rangle</math>\n\nIn vector form, you might write\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle \\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} a_\\psi \\\\ b_\\psi \\end{pmatrix} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad |\\psi\\rangle \\doteq \\begin{pmatrix} c_\\psi \\\\ d_\\psi \\end{pmatrix} </math>\ndepending on which basis you are using. In other words, the \"coordinates\" of a vector depend on the basis used.\n\nThere is a mathematical relationship between {{math|''a''<sub>\u03c8</sub>}}, {{math|''b''<sub>\u03c8</sub>}}, {{math|''c''<sub>\u03c8</sub>}} and {{math|''d''<sub>\u03c8</sub>}}; see [[change of basis]].\n\n===Misleading uses===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}\n\nThere are a few conventions and abuses of notation that are generally accepted by the physics community, but which might confuse the non-initiated.\n\nIt is common to use the same symbol for ''labels'' and ''constants'' in the same equation. For example, {{math|''\u03b1\u0302'' {{ket|''\u03b1''}} {{=}} ''\u03b1'' {{ket|''\u03b1''}}}}, where the symbol {{math|''\u03b1''}} is used '''simultaneously''' as the ''name of the operator'' {{math|''\u03b1\u0302''}}, its ''eigenvector'' {{math|{{ket|''\u03b1''}}}} and the associated ''eigenvalue'' {{math|''\u03b1''}}.\n\nSomething similar occurs in component notation of vectors. While {{math|''\u03a8''}} (uppercase) is traditionally associated with wavefunctions, {{math|''\u03c8''}} (lowercase) may be used to denote a ''label'', a ''wave function'' or ''complex constant'' in the same context, usually differentiated only by a subscript.\n\nThe main abuses are including operations inside the vector labels. This is done for a fast notation of scaling vectors. E.g. if the vector {{math|{{ket|''\u03b1''}}}} is scaled by {{sqrt|2}}, it might be denoted by {{math|{{ket|''\u03b1''/{{sqrt|2}}}}}}, which makes no sense since {{math|''\u03b1''}} is a label, not a function or a number, so you can't perform operations on it.\n\nThis is especially common when denoting vectors as tensor products, where part of the labels are moved '''outside''' the designed slot, e.g. {{math|{{ket|''\u03b1''}} {{=}} {{ket|''\u03b1''/{{sqrt|2}}<sub>1</sub>}} \u2297 {{ket|''\u03b1''/{{sqrt|2}}<sub>2</sub>}}}}. Here part of the labeling that should state that all three vectors are different was moved outside the kets, as subscripts 1 and 2. And a further abuse occurs, since {{math|''\u03b1''}} is meant to refer to the norm of the first vector\u2014which is a ''label'' denoting a ''value''.\n\n==Linear operators==\n{{see also|Linear operator}}\n\n===Linear operators acting on kets===\n\nA [[linear operator]] is a map that inputs a ket and outputs a ket. (In order to be called \"linear\", it is required to have [[linear operator|certain properties]].) In other words, if {{math|'''''A'''''}} is a linear operator and {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is a ket, then {{math|'''''A'''''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is another ket.\n\nIn an {{math|''N''}}-dimensional Hilbert space, {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} can be written as an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 1}} [[column vector]], and then {{math|'''''A'''''}} is an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 ''N''}} matrix with complex entries. The ket {{math|'''''A'''''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} can be computed by normal [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nLinear operators are ubiquitous in the theory of quantum mechanics. For example, observable physical quantities are represented by [[self-adjoint operator]]s, such as [[energy]] or [[momentum]], whereas transformative processes are represented by [[unitary operator|unitary]] linear operators such as rotation or the progression of time.\n\n===Linear operators acting on bras===\n\nOperators can also be viewed as acting on bras ''from the right hand side''. Specifically, if {{math|'''''A'''''}} is a linear operator and {{math|{{bra|''\u03c6''}}}} is a bra, then {{math|{{bra|''\u03c6''}}'''''A'''''}} is another bra defined by the rule\n\n:<math>\\bigl(\\langle\\phi|\\boldsymbol{A}\\bigr) |\\psi\\rangle = \\langle\\phi| \\bigl(\\boldsymbol{A}|\\psi\\rangle\\bigr) \\,,</math>\n\n(in other words, a [[function composition]]). This expression is commonly written as (cf. [[energy inner product]])\n\n:<math>\\langle\\phi|\\boldsymbol{A}|\\psi\\rangle \\,.</math>\n\nIn an {{math|''N''}}-dimensional Hilbert space, {{math|{{bra|''\u03c6''}}}} can be written as a {{math|1 \u00d7 ''N''}} [[row vector]], and {{math|'''''A'''''}} (as in the previous section) is an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 ''N''}} matrix. Then the bra {{math|{{bra|''\u03c6''}}'''''A'''''}} can be computed by normal [[matrix multiplication]].\n\nIf the same state vector appears on both bra and ket side,\n:<math>\\langle\\psi|\\boldsymbol{A}|\\psi\\rangle \\,,</math>\nthen this expression gives the [[expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation value]], or mean or average value, of the observable represented by operator {{math|'''''A'''''}} for the physical system in the state {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}}.\n\n===Outer products===\n\nA convenient way to define linear operators on a Hilbert space {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}} is given by the [[outer product]]: if {{math|{{bra|''\u03d5''}}}} is a bra and {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is a ket, the outer product\n:<math> |\\phi\\rang \\, \\lang \\psi| </math>\ndenotes the [[finite-rank operator|rank-one operator]] with the rule \n:<math> \\bigl(|\\phi\\rang \\lang \\psi|\\bigr)(x) = \\lang \\psi | x \\rang |\\phi \\rang</math>.\n\nFor a finite-dimensional vector space, the outer product can be understood as simple matrix multiplication:\n:<math> |\\phi \\rangle \\, \\langle \\psi | \\doteq \n\\begin{pmatrix} \\phi_1 \\\\ \\phi_2 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ \\phi_N \\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix} \\psi_1^* & \\psi_2^* & \\cdots & \\psi_N^* \\end{pmatrix}\n= \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\phi_1 \\psi_1^* & \\phi_1 \\psi_2^* & \\cdots & \\phi_1 \\psi_N^* \\\\\n\\phi_2 \\psi_1^* & \\phi_2 \\psi_2^* & \\cdots & \\phi_2 \\psi_N^* \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n\\phi_N \\psi_1^* & \\phi_N \\psi_2^* & \\cdots & \\phi_N \\psi_N^* \\end{pmatrix}\n</math>\nThe outer product is an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 ''N''}} matrix, as expected for a linear operator.\n\nOne of the uses of the outer product is to construct [[projection operator]]s. Given a ket {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} of norm 1, the orthogonal projection onto the [[Linear subspace|subspace]] spanned by {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle \\, \\langle\\psi| \\,.</math>\n\n===Hermitian conjugate operator===\n{{main|Hermitian conjugate}}\nJust as kets and bras can be transformed into each other (making {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} into {{math|{{bra|''\u03c8''}}}}), the element from the dual space corresponding to {{math|''A''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is {{math|{{bra|''\u03c8''}}''A''<sup>\u2020</sup>}},  where {{math|''A''<sup>\u2020</sup>}} denotes the [[Hermitian conjugate]] (or adjoint) of the operator {{math|''A''}}. In other words,\n:<math> |\\phi\\rangle = A |\\psi\\rangle \\quad \\text{if and only if} \\quad \\langle\\phi| = \\langle \\psi | A^\\dagger \\,.</math>\n\nIf {{math|''A''}} is expressed as an {{math|''N'' \u00d7 ''N''}} matrix, then {{math|''A''<sup>\u2020</sup>}} is its [[conjugate transpose]].\n\n[[Self-adjoint]] operators, where {{math|''A'' {{=}} ''A''<sup>\u2020</sup>}}, play an important role in quantum mechanics; for example, an [[observable]] is always described by a self-adjoint operator. If {{mvar|A}} is a self-adjoint operator, then {{math|{{bra|''\u03c8''}}''A''{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is always a real number (not complex). This implies that [[Expectation value (quantum mechanics)|expectation values]] of observables are real.\n\n==Properties==\nBra\u2013ket notation was designed to facilitate the formal manipulation of linear-algebraic expressions. Some of the properties that allow this manipulation are listed herein. In what follows, {{math|''c''<sub>1</sub>}} and {{math|''c''<sub>2</sub>}} denote arbitrary [[complex number]]s, {{math|''c''*}} denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of {{math|''c''}}, {{math|''A''}} and {{math|''B''}} denote arbitrary linear operators, and these properties are to hold for any choice of bras and kets.\n\n===Linearity===\n* Since bras are linear functionals,\n\n::<math>\\langle\\phi| \\bigl( c_1|\\psi_1\\rangle + c_2|\\psi_2\\rangle \\bigr) = c_1\\langle\\phi|\\psi_1\\rangle + c_2\\langle\\phi|\\psi_2\\rangle \\,. </math>\n\n* By the definition of addition and scalar multiplication of linear functionals in the [[dual space]],<ref>[http://bohr.physics.berkeley.edu/classes/221/1112/notes/hilbert.pdf Lecture notes by Robert Littlejohn], eqns 12 and 13</ref>\n\n::<math>\\bigl(c_1 \\langle\\phi_1| + c_2 \\langle\\phi_2|\\bigr) |\\psi\\rangle = c_1 \\langle\\phi_1|\\psi\\rangle + c_2 \\langle\\phi_2|\\psi\\rangle \\,. </math>\n\n===Associativity===\nGiven any expression involving complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators (but not addition), written in bra\u2013ket notation, the parenthetical groupings do not matter (i.e., the [[associative property]] holds). For example:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\lang \\psi| \\bigl(A |\\phi\\rang\\bigr) = \\bigl(\\lang \\psi|A\\bigr)|\\phi\\rang \\, &\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\, \\lang \\psi | A | \\phi \\rang \\\\\n\\bigl(A|\\psi\\rang\\bigr)\\lang \\phi| = A\\bigl(|\\psi\\rang \\lang \\phi|\\bigr) \\, &\\stackrel{\\text{def}}{=} \\, A | \\psi \\rang \\lang \\phi |\n\\end{align}</math>\nand so forth. The expressions on the right (with no parentheses whatsoever) are allowed to be written unambiguously ''because'' of the equalities on the left. Note that the associative property does ''not'' hold for expressions that include nonlinear operators, such as the [[antilinear]] [[T-symmetry|time reversal operator]] in physics.\n\n===Hermitian conjugation===\nBra\u2013ket notation makes it particularly easy to compute the Hermitian conjugate (also called ''dagger'', and denoted {{math|\u2020}}) of expressions. The formal rules are:\n* The Hermitian conjugate of a bra is the corresponding ket, and vice versa.\n* The Hermitian conjugate of a complex number is its complex conjugate.\n* The Hermitian conjugate of the Hermitian conjugate of anything (linear operators, bras, kets, numbers) is itself\u2014i.e.,\n::<math>\\left(x^\\dagger\\right)^\\dagger=x \\,.</math>\n* Given any combination of complex numbers, bras, kets, inner products, outer products, and/or linear operators, written in bra\u2013ket notation, its Hermitian conjugate can be computed by reversing the order of the components, and taking the Hermitian conjugate of each.\n\nThese rules are sufficient to formally write the Hermitian conjugate of any such expression; some examples are as follows:\n* Kets:\n::<math>\n\\bigl(c_1|\\psi_1\\rangle + c_2|\\psi_2\\rangle\\bigr)^\\dagger = c_1^* \\langle\\psi_1| + c_2^* \\langle\\psi_2| \\,.\n</math>\n* Inner products:\n::<math>\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle^* = \\langle \\psi|\\phi\\rangle \\,.</math>\n\n:Note that {{math|{{bra-ket|''\u03c6''|''\u03c8''}}}} is a scalar, so the Hermitian conjugate is just the complex conjugate, i.e.\n::<math>\\bigl(\\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle\\bigr)^\\dagger = \\langle \\phi | \\psi \\rangle^*</math>\n* Matrix elements:\n::<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle \\phi| A | \\psi \\rangle^* &= \\left\\langle \\psi \\left| A^\\dagger \\right|\\phi \\right\\rangle \\\\\n\\left\\langle \\phi\\left| A^\\dagger B^\\dagger \\right| \\psi \\right\\rangle^* &= \\langle \\psi | BA |\\phi \\rangle \\,.\n\\end{align}</math>\n* Outer products:\n::<math>\\Big(\\bigl(c_1|\\phi_1\\rangle\\langle \\psi_1|\\bigr) + \\bigl(c_2|\\phi_2\\rangle\\langle\\psi_2|\\bigr)\\Big)^\\dagger = \\bigl(c_1^* |\\psi_1\\rangle\\langle \\phi_1|\\bigr) + \\bigl(c_2^*|\\psi_2\\rangle\\langle\\phi_2|\\bigr) \\,.</math>\n\n==Composite bras and kets==\nTwo Hilbert spaces {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} may form a third space {{math|''V'' \u2297 ''W''}} by a [[tensor product]]. In quantum mechanics, this is used for describing composite systems. If a system is composed of two subsystems described in {{math|''V''}} and {{math|''W''}} respectively, then the Hilbert space of the entire system is the tensor product of the two spaces. (The exception to this is if the subsystems are actually [[identical particles]]. In that case, the situation is a little more complicated.)\n\nIf {{math|{{ket|''\u03c8''}}}} is a ket in {{math|''V''}} and {{math|{{ket|''\u03c6''}}}} is a ket in {{math|''W''}}, the direct product of the two kets is a ket in {{math|''V'' \u2297 ''W''}}. This is written in various notations:\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle|\\phi\\rangle \\,,\\quad |\\psi\\rangle \\otimes |\\phi\\rangle\\,,\\quad|\\psi \\phi\\rangle\\,,\\quad|\\psi ,\\phi\\rangle\\,.</math>\n\nSee [[quantum entanglement#Quantum mechanical framework|quantum entanglement]] and the [[EPR paradox#Mathematical formulation|EPR paradox]] for applications of this product.\n\n==The unit operator==\nConsider a complete [[orthonormal]] system (''[[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]]''),\n:<math>\\{ e_i \\ | \\ i \\in \\mathbb{N} \\} \\,,</math>\nfor a Hilbert space {{math|''H''}}, with respect to the norm from an inner product {{math|{{angbr|\u00b7,\u00b7}}}}.\n\nFrom basic [[functional analysis]], it is  known that any ket <math>|\\psi\\rangle </math> can also be written as\n:<math>|\\psi\\rangle = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\langle e_i | \\psi \\rangle | e_i \\rangle,</math>\nwith {{math|{{bra-ket|\u00b7|\u00b7}}}} the inner product on the Hilbert space.\n\nFrom the commutativity of kets with (complex) scalars, it follows that\n:<math>\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} | e_i \\rangle \\langle e_i | = \\mathbb{1}</math>\nmust be the ''identity operator'', which sends each vector to itself.\n\nThis, then,  can be inserted in any expression without affecting its value; for example\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\langle v | w \\rangle &= \\langle v | \\left( \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} | e_i \\rangle \\langle e_i| \\right) | w \\rangle \\\\\n                      &= \\langle v | \\left( \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} | e_i \\rangle \\langle e_i| \\right) \\left( \\sum_{j \\in \\mathbb{N}} | e_j \\rangle \\langle e_j |\\right)| w \\rangle \\\\\n&= \\langle v | e_i \\rangle \\langle e_i | e_j \\rangle \\langle e_j | w \\rangle \\,, \n\\end{align}</math>\nwhere, in the last line, the [[Einstein summation convention]] has been used to avoid clutter.\n\nIn [[quantum mechanics]], it often occurs that little or no information about the inner product {{math|{{bra-ket|''\u03c8''|''\u03c6''}}}} of two arbitrary (state) kets is present, while it is still possible to say something about the expansion coefficients {{math|{{bra-ket|''\u03c8''|''e<sub>i</sub>''}} {{=}} {{bra-ket|''e<sub>i</sub>''|''\u03c8''}}*}} and {{math|{{bra-ket|''e<sub>i</sub>''|''\u03c6''}}}} of those vectors with respect to a specific (orthonormalized) basis. In this case, it is particularly useful to insert the unit operator into the bracket one time or more.\n\nFor more information, see [[Resolution of the identity]], \n*   &nbsp; &nbsp; {{math|1 {{=}} \u222b d''x'' {{ket|''x''}}{{bra|''x''}} {{=}} \u222b d''p'' {{ket|''p''}}{{bra|''p''}}}},  where  {{math| {{ket|''p''}} {{=}} \u222b d''x'' ''e''<sup>''ixp''/''\u0127''</sup>{{ket|''x''}}/{{sqrt|2''\u03c0\u0127''}}}}.\n\nSince {{math|{{bra-ket|''x''\u2032|''x''}} {{=}} ''\u03b4''(''x'' \u2212 ''x''\u2032)}}, plane waves follow,<ref>In his book (1958), Ch.

What physicists would denote by {{math|{{ket|''h''}}}} is the vector itself. That is,\n\n:<math> |h\\rangle\\in \\mathcal{H} </math>.\n\nLet {{math|{{mathcal|H}}*}} be the [[dual space]] of {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}}. This is the space of linear functionals on {{math|{{mathcal|H}}}}. The isomorphism {{math|''\u03a6'' : {{mathcal|H}} \u2192 {{mathcal|H}}*}} is defined by {{math|''\u03a6''(''h'') {{=}} ''\u03c6<sub>h</sub>''}}, where for every {{math|''g'' \u2208 {{mathcal|H}}}} we define\n:<math> \\phi_h(g) = \\mbox{IP}(h,g) = (h,g) = \\langle h,g \\rangle = \\langle h|g \\rangle </math>,\nwhere {{math|IP(\u00b7,\u00b7)}}, {{math|(\u00b7,\u00b7)}}, {{math|{{angbr|\u00b7,\u00b7}}}} and {{math|{{bra-ket|\u00b7|\u00b7}}}} are just different notations for expressing an inner product between two elements in a Hilbert space (or for the first three, in any inner product space). Notational confusion arises when identifying {{math|''\u03c6<sub>h</sub>''}} and {{math|''g''}} with {{math|{{bra|''h''}}}} and {{math|{{ket|''g''}}}} respectively. This is because of literal symbolic substitutions. Let {{math|''\u03c6<sub>h</sub>'' {{=}} ''H'' {{=}} {{bra|''h''}}}} and let {{math|''g'' {{=}} G {{=}} {{ket|''g''}}}}. This gives\n\n:<math> \\phi_h(g) = H(g) = H(G)=\\langle h|(G) = \\langle h|\\bigl(|g\\rangle\\bigr) \\,. </math>\n\nOne ignores the parentheses and removes the double bars. Some properties of this notation are convenient since we are dealing with linear operators and composition acts like a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] multiplication.\n\nMoreover, mathematicians usually write the dual entity not at the first place, as the physicists do, but at the second one, and they usually use not an [[asterisk]] but an overline (which the physicists reserve for averages and the [[Dirac equation#Conservation of probability current|Dirac spinor adjoint]]) to denote [[complex conjugate]] numbers; i.e., for scalar products mathematicians usually write\n:<math>(\\phi ,\\psi )=\\int \\phi (x)\\cdot \\overline{\\psi(x)}\\, \\mathrm{d}x \\,,</math>\nwhereas physicists would write for the same quantity\n:<math> \\langle\\psi |\\phi \\rangle=\\int \\,\\psi^*(x)\\cdot\\phi(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x.</math>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mathematics|Physics}}\n* [[Angular momentum diagrams (quantum mechanics)]]\n* [[N-slit interferometric equation|{{mvar|n}}-slit interferometric equation]]\n* [[Quantum state]]\n* [[Inner product]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite journal |last=Dirac |first=P.

{"title_page": "Khaled Hafez", "text_new": "{{nofootnotes|date=April 2020}}\n{{external links|date=April 2020}}\n'''Khaled Hafez''' (born Khaled Yehia Hafez Donia on 5 August 1963) is an Egyptian/French visual artist and educator. He is born in [[Cairo]], Egypt where he currently lives and works. He studied medicine and followed the evening classes of the Cairo School of Fine Arts (Faculty of Fine Arts) in the eighties. After attaining a medical degree in 1987 and M.Sc. as a medical specialist in 1992, he gave up medical practices in the early nineties for a career in the arts. He later obtained an MFA in [[new media]] and [[digital art]] from Transart Institutehttps://www.transartinstitute.org (New York, USA) and [[Danube University Krems]] (Austria). Hafez practice spans the mediums of painting, film / video, photography, installation and interdisciplinary approaches. Hafez is a [[Fulbright Fellow]] and Rockefeller Fellow.\n\n==Early life and early career itinerary==\n\nHafez was born in the Cairo suburb of [[Heliopolis, Cairo|Heliopolis]] to Yehia Hafez Donia and Wahiba Kamel, both physicians, which had an influence on his later education. His father served a long career in the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] and retired as Brigadier after serving in five military Middle East conflicts, with special assignments in Syria, Yemen and Algeria in the late fifties and early sixties. His mother retired as a Professor of Internal Medicine, after in turn having served part of her career in the army, in special assignments in the sixties and seventies. The military background of his parents, especially that of his father\u2019s itinerary, is continuously referred to in Hafez\u2019s video works*, as well as in several large scale installations**.\n\nHafez went to primary and secondary education at [[St. Georges College, Cairo]], an Irish Catholic missionary school in Cairo, which enabled him to speak English and some French at an early age. Hafez studied medicine and followed the evening classes of the Cairo Fine Arts School (a.k.a. the Faculty of Fine Arts, Helwan University) in the early eighties. In those evening classes, Hafez studied painting with Egyptian painters Hamed Nada and later with Zakaria el Zeiny. After attaining a medical degree in 1987 and M.Sc. in dermatology & venereology in 1992, as well as two specialization diplomas ensued from Rene Descartes University [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Descartes_University] (AFSA) and Paris South University [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Sud_University] (DU) in Paris, France in 1994, he gave up medical practice for a career in the arts. In 2009 he obtained an MFA in new media and digital arts from Transart Institute (New York, USA) and Danube University Krems (Austria).\n\n== Work ==\n\nFor over three decades, Hafez core research focused on the exploration of the complex nature of identity; for his painting practice, the identity he scrutinizes is a one that is a composite of African, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Arab, Islamic, with ancient Egyptian and Judeo-Christian traces. In his video/film, photography and other interdisciplinary image-based works, Hafez explains \u201cI am interested in movement, an element that was indispensable in ancient Egyptian painting, where all painted elements were in motion, as opposed to Egyptian sculpture that always caught the protagonists in a \u201cpose\u201d, nearly always static. I use a lot of symbols and codes from a diversity of ancient cultures, and from the universal heritage of the world. In a contemporary culture dominated by a century of film and animation, the similarity between the ancient and the current contemporary forms of the kinetic is intriguing to me, and a focal aspect of my research. In my painting.\u201d\n\n== Painting ==\n\nHafez started as a figurative painter during the years when he studied at the evening classes at the Fine Arts school, with some inclination to neo-figuration, though a complete abstract painting practice marked his second and third solo exhibitions, entitled A Tale of Two Leos and Prisoner of Freedom (1989 and 1990 respectively).\n\nHafez moved to Paris in 1992, where he lived for three consecutive years; in Paris he became interested the larger than life photography used in street advertising and outdoor billboard signage, which to him was an urban landscape \u201cdifferent in structure and visuals\u201d from where he came from. After his return to Cairo in 1995, and his continuous mobility between Paris and Cairo for the two decades that followed, Hafez\u2019s painting practice saw a complete shift to neo-figuration [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-figurative_art] in 1996, where imagery was extracted from magazine advertising, manipulated and reassembled within mixed media painting, a style that developed into his personal style of painting in the following decades. \nHafez describes his use of figures from manipulated consumer goods advertising imagery and transforming those into ancient deities as \u201cattempt to break the barrier between East and West, between past and present, and between everything sacred and profane\u201d. In the projects ''Visions from a Rusty Memory''\u201d (1998) and ''Faster than the City'' (2000), both projects of medium sized to large mixed media canvases, he explored through visual irony and in juxtaposition notions of fiction and reality, legend, the hero as icon, space as a field where fiction and reality play, time and timelessness, memory as a universal recording device and a bank for codes and symbols, and color as an identifier. \nHafez says about this period \u201cDuring the early months of 1992, I had to lock up my studio in Cairo to start, a-never-to-be-forgotten relationship with Paris. Three years later, (and 9 group exhibitions), I had to prepare to lock up the mini studio where I worked for some time, a room in a shared apartment where I actually lived in one crowded Paris street. I had to dismantle canvases from stretchers, unframed works on paper, tailor carton boxes to take as many works as possible, and send all my work during three years on a boat to Alexandria with all my luggage and personal affairs. The works did not enjoy any advantage of the artwork treatment I enjoy today; protective packaging, art insurance, delicate handling, etc\u2026After having modestly boxed all my work, and after having sent everything, including my painting materials, I had to \u201clook for and do something else\u201d during the few weeks left till my departure to cairo. This \u201csomething else\u201d actually came out as a project of printed images and photomontages that perfectly describes an Egyptian living in Paris. Paris, as a pattern for occidental cosmopolitan cities, is --like other similar cities-- dominated by a genre of image culture; street and metro billboards, fully illustrated journals, colorful magazines, printed media saturated by pictures. A dweller in Paris does not need a text to understand a given message. Big numerous pictures deliver the message and short texts only elaborate. The image is the hero, the subject, the content and the latest news\u201d.\n\n==Installation==\n\nHafez\u2019s early installations (1989-1999) incorporated sculptural elements were linked to solo presentations; his first installation Cosmic Melody (1989) constituted an integral part to his painting solo presentation ''A Tale of Two Leos'' at Nile Gallery II (currently known as Palace of the Arts), Cairo, where an assemblage sculptural piece lay on one third of the space tying the four corners of the gallery ceiling in thick industrial maritime ropes; the viewers had to exert an effort to manage the footwork choreography and watch the large scale paintings. The ropes tying the room corresponded to geometrical lines within the painted surfaces.\n''Prisoner of Freedom'' (1990) \u2013an installation also linked to a painting project using the same title presented at the principal space of the Cairo Atelier, \u2013a none-for-profit space that exists in Cairo since the early thirties of the twentieth century\u2013 had a room partially ceiled from entry by ropes, separating the viewer from a real human skeleton, and few lines of graffiti written on the front wall. \n1n 1999 hafez installed a solo presentation with two stand-alone installations at the Guezira Art Center, one of the public spaces in Cairo, ''Halfway Home and The Electronic Gods'', none of them linked to any painting project. Both works explored juxtapositions of the sacred versus the consumable profane, and the validity of the linear perception of time in its relation to space. In 2006 Hafez started creating installations that would serve as stand-alone works as well as part of video installations; his reason for that as he says is that \u201cI always strive for witty solutions, and witty conversations; I come from a high context culture where a word may mean two or more things, a gest may mean one or three things, I find it witty and handy; so I create installations that can work alone or as part of another work, and even in my painting practice: diptychs can be linked and each side of the work can work alone\u201d.\n\nThis \u201cdiscipline\u201d \u2013as he addresses this part of the practice\u2013 entails a certain amount of design prior to execution. His first video installation work ''Revolution'', commissioned by the 1st Singapore Biennale, comprised a 4-minute 44 seconds video \u2013collected a year later by MuHKa, Antwerp, Belgium--, and a three-piece bronze sculptural installation entitled ''Contaminated Belief'' exhibited in museum-like glass cabinets \u2013both video and sculptural installation collected in 2010 by the Bamako Museum of Art, Mali. The video installation was critical of the three promises of the 1952 coup d\u2019etat that transformed Egypt from monarchy to a republic, namely social equality, liberty and unity. The split screen single channel video shows the same actor playing with a gun to represent subjugation, a cleaver (called \u201csatour\u201d in Arabic) to represent threat and terror and a hammer to represent neo economic slavery; each instrument represent a broken promise: the social equality of the gun, the pseudo liberty of the free transcontinental multinational economy, and the cleaver as a cut-throat tool of radical terrorism.\n\nMore recent installations include ''The Memory Box'', a versatile piece that can work as a stand-alone sculptural work as well as part of the 5-minute 55 seconds video installation ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: The Venice Water Composite'' (2013), conceived for the Maldives Pavilion of the 55th Venice Biennale. The work incorporate bronze casts of real objects that played a part in shaping the artist\u2019s growing memory as a child, like his father\u2019s camera when he served in military intelligence in Syria (1958-1960) and Yemen (1960-1964), and a bronze cast for his Rolex watch replica when he served in special assignment in Algeria (1966-1967). The video installation ''Mirror Sonata in Six Movements'', created for the 56th Venice Biennale official collateral event ''In the eye of the Thunderstorm'', curated by Martina Corgnati and commissioned by Omar Donia, was composed of a room, where the three front walls received animated synchronized screens that completed each other, while the viewer would stand in the middle surrounded by the simulated temple. The animation was based on one of Hafez older (2010) large-scale (750x200cm) canvases: ''Tomb Sonata in Three Military Movements'', where all elements on the painted surface were animated horizontally, as well as vertically to simulate perspective. The animation was created by co-worker artist Ahmed El Shaer and the music score was created by composer Mohamed Saleh of the then Cairo Symphony Orchestra, both regular contributors and coworkers in Hafez video works.\n\n==Performance==\n\nKhaled Hafez wrote and performed only one single performance in his career: ''Dwelling The Rest of History''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Khaled_Hafez-_MANIFESTA_8_performance_at_the_St._Antoin_Prison,_2010.jpg], which was part of an interdisciplinary project designed for and commissioned by Manifest 8 which took part in 2010 in Murcia and Cartagena, Spain. Hafez posed as an ex-prisoner offering a guided tour in the prison of San Anton, Cartagena. For 30 minutes, Hafez recounted fictitious stories of the prison and its prisoners, which were all scripted and had nothing to do with reality. At the end of the tour, Hafez explained that everything he said about the prison were not true, as all historical documents of this notorious institution have been purposefully destroyed in the eighties. For that performance, Hafez dressed in clich\u00e9-comic book striated shirt and barefoot, took the audience in a guided tour through the cells and corridors of the San Anton prison, recounting a scripted false history of the prison. Embedded within the true historical facts, there are fabricated stories that compensates for the total lack of historical documents in any archives.\n\n==Photography==\n\nOf all the media that Hafez uses to explore subject matter, his photography is almost always realistic and shows total refrain from conceptual approaches. With works shot in color, then transformed in black and white, cropped and presented in almost-always square format and printed on archival paper in small dimensions. Hafez explains \u201cmy first camera was a polaroid land camera 2000 offered to me by my father when I was 14, then upgraded to the 3000 model, also in plastic, one year later. I became addictive to the square format. I did not take photography any seriously except in the last two decades. I guess Paris and its outdoor photography-based advertising still influences me since the nineties. Photography is a brilliant medium: you can use it to document, freeze a moment in time, tell a story or just create a gorgeous composition for a function or another. Such sublime versatility of a medium is compelling. Indeed it has its specificity: it became too democratic, and anyone can create a photograph; this is excellent too. I am visually trained for photojournalism and street candid photography; this is what attracts me, and this is what engages me. Yes, for this noble medium, I refrain from conceptually approaching it, for fear of killing the joy of assimilating an accessible and comprehensible artwork by too much concept or loading the simple medium with fake messages that demolishes the straightforwardness of the image. A photographic image is perfect as it is, conceptualize it then you assassinate it.\u201d Hafez photography was exhibited in numerous solo and group exhibitions principally in Cairo, Egypt, though two of his photographic projects are part of the [[Ars Aevi]] Museum of Contemporary Art in Sarajevo, Bosnia Herzegovina, and the [[Vladikavkaz]] Museum of Art, North Osetia-Alania, Russia.\n\n==Video / Film==\n\n2015 - ''Mirrorr Sonata in Six Movements (for 12 hands)'', 90 seconds, video animation based on the painting \u201cTomb Sonata in Three Military Movements, 750x200cm, 2010.\nCreated for the 56th Venice Biennale official collateral exhibition ''In the Eye of the Thunderstorm'', Commissioner Omar Donia, Curator Martina Corgnati.\n\n2013 - ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: Sounds of the Kavkaz 2013'', 9 minutes, single channel digital, Comissioned by ALANICA 6 & Vladikavkaz Museum of Art, Russia.\n \t\t\n- ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: Water Composite 2013'', 5 minutes 55 seconds, three-channel digital video, 55th Venice Biennale, Italy, 2013.\n\n2011 - ''11.02-2011: the video diaries'', 5 minutes 55 seconds, 3-channel digital, Comissioned by the 8th Mercosur Biennale 2011, Single channel adaptation: 11th Havana Biennale 2012.\n\n- ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: Sounds of the Port 2011'', 2 minutes 58 seconds, single channel digital.\n\n \n2010 - ''Dwelling'', 11 minutes, single channel digital, Commissioned by Manifesta 8, curated by Chamber of Public Secrets. \n \n \n2009 - ''The A77A Project (On Presidents & Superheroes)'', 3minutes, 2D and 3D animation, video, sound score, single channel digital, Prizewinner Bamako Photobiennale 2012.\n \n \n2008 - The third Vision around 1:00 pm, 7 minutes, 4-channel digital, DV, stock images and stock footage, DV.\n \n \n2007 - ''Visions of a Contaminated Memory'', 5 minutes 45 seconds, 3-channel digital, DV, stock footage, DV, Comissioned by the Sharjah Biennale 2007.\n \t\n- ''Fruit Salad Mess with Collateral Surgical Precision'', 1 minute 30 seconds, single-channel digital, manipulated web images, original sound score,\n \n \n2006 - ''Revolution'', 4 minutes, split screen single-channel Hi-Def, Comissioned by the 1st Singapore Biennale 2006. \n \n \n2005 - ''The Red Crown'', 30 minutes, documentary, Egyptian Natioanl Film Center, Digital Beta.\n \t\n- ''Idlers\u2019 Clip'', 3 minutes, single-channel, Mini-DV.\n\n2003 - ''Idlers' Logic'', 24 minutes Experimental with three actors, Mini-DV, Prizewinner Dakar Biennae Dak\u2019Art 2004\n- ''Obsesive Compulsive Neurosis'', 4 minutes, single-channel, Mini-DV.\n\n \n2001 - ''Visions of a Cheeseburger Memory'', 11 min, Super VHS and Mini-DV, stock footage.\n\n==Books==\n\nHafez has to date two experimental published books combining drawing and prose in the Arabic language, and one academic book about image-based art practices authored in English, all three books published in 2010, though none of them was authored that year.

August 1963) is an Egyptian/French visual artist and educator. He is born in [[Cairo]], Egypt where he currently lives and works. He studied medicine and followed the evening classes of the Cairo School of Fine Arts (Faculty of Fine Arts) in the eighties. After attaining a medical degree in 1987 and M.Sc. as a medical specialist in 1992, he gave up medical practices in the early nineties for a career in the arts. He later obtained an MFA in [[new media]] and [[digital art]] from Transart Institutehttps://www.transartinstitute.org (New York, USA) and [[Danube University Krems]] (Austria). Hafez practice spans the mediums of painting, film / video, photography, installation and interdisciplinary approaches. Hafez is a [[Fulbright Fellow]] and Rockefeller Fellow.\n\n==Early life and early career itinerary==\n\nHafez was born in the Cairo suburb of [[Heliopolis, Cairo|Heliopolis]] to Yehia Hafez Donia and Wahiba Kamel, both physicians, which had an influence on his later education. His father served a long career in the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] and retired as Brigadier after serving in five military Middle East conflicts, with special assignments in Syria, Yemen and Algeria in the late fifties and early sixties. His mother retired as a Professor of Internal Medicine, after in turn having served part of her career in the army, in special assignments in the sixties and seventies. The military background of his parents, especially that of his father\u2019s itinerary, is continuously referred to in Hafez\u2019s video works*, as well as in several large scale installations**.\n\nHafez went to primary and secondary education at [[St. Georges College, Cairo]], an Irish Catholic missionary school in Cairo, which enabled him to speak English and some French at an early age. Hafez studied medicine and followed the evening classes of the Cairo Fine Arts School (a.k.a. the Faculty of Fine Arts, Helwan University) in the early eighties. In those evening classes, Hafez studied painting with Egyptian painters Hamed Nada and later with Zakaria el Zeiny. After attaining a medical degree in 1987 and M.Sc. in dermatology & venereology in 1992, as well as two specialization diplomas ensued from Rene Descartes University [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Descartes_University] (AFSA) and Paris South University [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Sud_University] (DU) in Paris, France in 1994, he gave up medical practice for a career in the arts. In 2009 he obtained an MFA in new media and digital arts from Transart Institute (New York, USA) and Danube University Krems (Austria).\n\n== Work ==\n\nFor over three decades, Hafez core research focused on the exploration of the complex nature of identity; for his painting practice, the identity he scrutinizes is a one that is a composite of African, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean, Arab, Islamic, with ancient Egyptian and Judeo-Christian traces. In his video/film, photography and other interdisciplinary image-based works, Hafez explains \u201cI am interested in movement, an element that was indispensable in ancient Egyptian painting, where all painted elements were in motion, as opposed to Egyptian sculpture that always caught the protagonists in a \u201cpose\u201d, nearly always static. I use a lot of symbols and codes from a diversity of ancient cultures, and from the universal heritage of the world. In a contemporary culture dominated by a century of film and animation, the similarity between the ancient and the current contemporary forms of the kinetic is intriguing to me, and a focal aspect of my research. In my painting.\u201d\n\n== Painting ==\n\nHafez started as a figurative painter during the years when he studied at the evening classes at the Fine Arts school, with some inclination to neo-figuration, though a complete abstract painting practice marked his second and third solo exhibitions, entitled A Tale of Two Leos and Prisoner of Freedom (1989 and 1990 respectively).\n\nHafez moved to Paris in 1992, where he lived for three consecutive years; in Paris he became interested the larger than life photography used in street advertising and outdoor billboard signage, which to him was an urban landscape \u201cdifferent in structure and visuals\u201d from where he came from. After his return to Cairo in 1995, and his continuous mobility between Paris and Cairo for the two decades that followed, Hafez\u2019s painting practice saw a complete shift to neo-figuration [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-figurative_art] in 1996, where imagery was extracted from magazine advertising, manipulated and reassembled within mixed media painting, a style that developed into his personal style of painting in the following decades. \nHafez describes his use of figures from manipulated consumer goods advertising imagery and transforming those into ancient deities as \u201cattempt to break the barrier between East and West, between past and present, and between everything sacred and profane\u201d. In the projects ''Visions from a Rusty Memory''\u201d (1998) and ''Faster than the City'' (2000), both projects of medium sized to large mixed media canvases, he explored through visual irony and in juxtaposition notions of fiction and reality, legend, the hero as icon, space as a field where fiction and reality play, time and timelessness, memory as a universal recording device and a bank for codes and symbols, and color as an identifier. \nHafez says about this period \u201cDuring the early months of 1992, I had to lock up my studio in Cairo to start, a-never-to-be-forgotten relationship with Paris. Three years later, (and 9 group exhibitions), I had to prepare to lock up the mini studio where I worked for some time, a room in a shared apartment where I actually lived in one crowded Paris street. I had to dismantle canvases from stretchers, unframed works on paper, tailor carton boxes to take as many works as possible, and send all my work during three years on a boat to Alexandria with all my luggage and personal affairs. The works did not enjoy any advantage of the artwork treatment I enjoy today; protective packaging, art insurance, delicate handling, etc\u2026After having modestly boxed all my work, and after having sent everything, including my painting materials, I had to \u201clook for and do something else\u201d during the few weeks left till my departure to cairo. This \u201csomething else\u201d actually came out as a project of printed images and photomontages that perfectly describes an Egyptian living in Paris. Paris, as a pattern for occidental cosmopolitan cities, is --like other similar cities-- dominated by a genre of image culture; street and metro billboards, fully illustrated journals, colorful magazines, printed media saturated by pictures. A dweller in Paris does not need a text to understand a given message. Big numerous pictures deliver the message and short texts only elaborate. The image is the hero, the subject, the content and the latest news\u201d.\n\n==Installation==\n\nHafez\u2019s early installations (1989-1999) incorporated sculptural elements were linked to solo presentations; his first installation Cosmic Melody (1989) constituted an integral part to his painting solo presentation ''A Tale of Two Leos'' at Nile Gallery II (currently known as Palace of the Arts), Cairo, where an assemblage sculptural piece lay on one third of the space tying the four corners of the gallery ceiling in thick industrial maritime ropes; the viewers had to exert an effort to manage the footwork choreography and watch the large scale paintings. The ropes tying the room corresponded to geometrical lines within the painted surfaces.\n''Prisoner of Freedom'' (1990) \u2013an installation also linked to a painting project using the same title presented at the principal space of the Cairo Atelier, \u2013a none-for-profit space that exists in Cairo since the early thirties of the twentieth century\u2013 had a room partially ceiled from entry by ropes, separating the viewer from a real human skeleton, and few lines of graffiti written on the front wall. \n1n 1999 hafez installed a solo presentation with two stand-alone installations at the Guezira Art Center, one of the public spaces in Cairo, ''Halfway Home and The Electronic Gods'', none of them linked to any painting project. Both works explored juxtapositions of the sacred versus the consumable profane, and the validity of the linear perception of time in its relation to space. In 2006 Hafez started creating installations that would serve as stand-alone works as well as part of video installations; his reason for that as he says is that \u201cI always strive for witty solutions, and witty conversations; I come from a high context culture where a word may mean two or more things, a gest may mean one or three things, I find it witty and handy; so I create installations that can work alone or as part of another work, and even in my painting practice: diptychs can be linked and each side of the work can work alone\u201d.\n\nThis \u201cdiscipline\u201d \u2013as he addresses this part of the practice\u2013 entails a certain amount of design prior to execution. His first video installation work ''Revolution'', commissioned by the 1st Singapore Biennale, comprised a 4-minute 44 seconds video \u2013collected a year later by MuHKa, Antwerp, Belgium--, and a three-piece bronze sculptural installation entitled ''Contaminated Belief'' exhibited in museum-like glass cabinets \u2013both video and sculptural installation collected in 2010 by the Bamako Museum of Art, Mali. The video installation was critical of the three promises of the 1952 coup d\u2019etat that transformed Egypt from monarchy to a republic, namely social equality, liberty and unity. The split screen single channel video shows the same actor playing with a gun to represent subjugation, a cleaver (called \u201csatour\u201d in Arabic) to represent threat and terror and a hammer to represent neo economic slavery; each instrument represent a broken promise: the social equality of the gun, the pseudo liberty of the free transcontinental multinational economy, and the cleaver as a cut-throat tool of radical terrorism.\n\nMore recent installations include ''The Memory Box'', a versatile piece that can work as a stand-alone sculptural work as well as part of the 5-minute 55 seconds video installation ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: The Venice Water Composite'' (2013), conceived for the Maldives Pavilion of the 55th Venice Biennale. The work incorporate bronze casts of real objects that played a part in shaping the artist\u2019s growing memory as a child, like his father\u2019s camera when he served in military intelligence in Syria (1958-1960) and Yemen (1960-1964), and a bronze cast for his Rolex watch replica when he served in special assignment in Algeria (1966-1967). The video installation ''Mirror Sonata in Six Movements'', created for the 56th Venice Biennale official collateral event ''In the eye of the Thunderstorm'', curated by Martina Corgnati and commissioned by Omar Donia, was composed of a room, where the three front walls received animated synchronized screens that completed each other, while the viewer would stand in the middle surrounded by the simulated temple. The animation was based on one of Hafez older (2010) large-scale (750x200cm) canvases: ''Tomb Sonata in Three Military Movements'', where all elements on the painted surface were animated horizontally, as well as vertically to simulate perspective. The animation was created by co-worker artist Ahmed El Shaer and the music score was created by composer Mohamed Saleh of the then Cairo Symphony Orchestra, both regular contributors and coworkers in Hafez video works.\n\n==Performance==\n\nKhaled Hafez wrote and performed only one single performance in his career: ''Dwelling The Rest of History''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Khaled_Hafez-_MANIFESTA_8_performance_at_the_St._Antoin_Prison,_2010.jpg], which was part of an interdisciplinary project designed for and commissioned by Manifest 8 which took part in 2010 in Murcia and Cartagena, Spain. Hafez posed as an ex-prisoner offering a guided tour in the prison of San Anton, Cartagena. For 30 minutes, Hafez recounted fictitious stories of the prison and its prisoners, which were all scripted and had nothing to do with reality. At the end of the tour, Hafez explained that everything he said about the prison were not true, as all historical documents of this notorious institution have been purposefully destroyed in the eighties. For that performance, Hafez dressed in clich\u00e9-comic book striated shirt and barefoot, took the audience in a guided tour through the cells and corridors of the San Anton prison, recounting a scripted false history of the prison. Embedded within the true historical facts, there are fabricated stories that compensates for the total lack of historical documents in any archives.\n\n==Photography==\n\nOf all the media that Hafez uses to explore subject matter, his photography is almost always realistic and shows total refrain from conceptual approaches. With works shot in color, then transformed in black and white, cropped and presented in almost-always square format and printed on archival paper in small dimensions. Hafez explains \u201cmy first camera was a polaroid land camera 2000 offered to me by my father when I was 14, then upgraded to the 3000 model, also in plastic, one year later. I became addictive to the square format. I did not take photography any seriously except in the last two decades. I guess Paris and its outdoor photography-based advertising still influences me since the nineties. Photography is a brilliant medium: you can use it to document, freeze a moment in time, tell a story or just create a gorgeous composition for a function or another. Such sublime versatility of a medium is compelling. Indeed it has its specificity: it became too democratic, and anyone can create a photograph; this is excellent too. I am visually trained for photojournalism and street candid photography; this is what attracts me, and this is what engages me. Yes, for this noble medium, I refrain from conceptually approaching it, for fear of killing the joy of assimilating an accessible and comprehensible artwork by too much concept or loading the simple medium with fake messages that demolishes the straightforwardness of the image. A photographic image is perfect as it is, conceptualize it then you assassinate it.\u201d Hafez photography was exhibited in numerous solo and group exhibitions principally in Cairo, Egypt, though two of his photographic projects are part of the [[Ars Aevi]] Museum of Contemporary Art in Sarajevo, Bosnia Herzegovina, and the [[Vladikavkaz]] Museum of Art, North Osetia-Alania, Russia.\n\n==Video / Film==\n\n2015 - ''Mirrorr Sonata in Six Movements (for 12 hands)'', 90 seconds, video animation based on the painting \u201cTomb Sonata in Three Military Movements, 750x200cm, 2010.\nCreated for the 56th Venice Biennale official collateral exhibition ''In the Eye of the Thunderstorm'', Commissioner Omar Donia, Curator Martina Corgnati.\n\n2013 - ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: Sounds of the Kavkaz 2013'', 9 minutes, single channel digital, Comissioned by ALANICA 6 & Vladikavkaz Museum of Art, Russia.\n \t\t\n- ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: Water Composite 2013'', 5 minutes 55 seconds, three-channel digital video, 55th Venice Biennale, Italy, 2013.\n\n2011 - ''11.02-2011: the video diaries'', 5 minutes 55 seconds, 3-channel digital, Comissioned by the 8th Mercosur Biennale 2011, Single channel adaptation: 11th Havana Biennale 2012.\n\n- ''On Noise, Sound & Silence: Sounds of the Port 2011'', 2 minutes 58 seconds, single channel digital.\n\n \n2010 - ''Dwelling'', 11 minutes, single channel digital, Commissioned by Manifesta 8, curated by Chamber of Public Secrets. \n \n \n2009 - ''The A77A Project (On Presidents & Superheroes)'', 3minutes, 2D and 3D animation, video, sound score, single channel digital, Prizewinner Bamako Photobiennale 2012.\n \n \n2008 - The third Vision around 1:00 pm, 7 minutes, 4-channel digital, DV, stock images and stock footage, DV.\n \n \n2007 - ''Visions of a Contaminated Memory'', 5 minutes 45 seconds, 3-channel digital, DV, stock footage, DV, Comissioned by the Sharjah Biennale 2007.\n \t\n- ''Fruit Salad Mess with Collateral Surgical Precision'', 1 minute 30 seconds, single-channel digital, manipulated web images, original sound score,\n \n \n2006 - ''Revolution'', 4 minutes, split screen single-channel Hi-Def, Comissioned by the 1st Singapore Biennale 2006. \n \n \n2005 - ''The Red Crown'', 30 minutes, documentary, Egyptian Natioanl Film Center, Digital Beta.\n \t\n- ''Idlers\u2019 Clip'', 3 minutes, single-channel, Mini-DV.\n\n2003 - ''Idlers' Logic'', 24 minutes Experimental with three actors, Mini-DV, Prizewinner Dakar Biennae Dak\u2019Art 2004\n- ''Obsesive Compulsive Neurosis'', 4 minutes, single-channel, Mini-DV.\n\n \n2001 - ''Visions of a Cheeseburger Memory'', 11 min, Super VHS and Mini-DV, stock footage.\n\n==Books==\n\nHafez has to date two experimental published books combining drawing and prose in the Arabic language, and one academic book about image-based art practices authored in English, all three books published in 2010, though none of them was authored that year.

South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|outbreak of MERS]] in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day.

South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women.

South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|outbreak of MERS]] in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day. In neighboring Japan, only about 2,700 people in total have been tested for COVID-19 as of 3 March. Officials in [[Seoul]] operate \"drive-thru\" testing stations for quick testing. Diagnostics company Seegene Inc. is also exporting its test kits to other countries including China, Europe and the US.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-04/south-korea-tests-hundreds-of-thousands-to-fight-virus-outbreak Virus Testing Blitz Appears to Keep Korea Death Rate Low] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309094739/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-04/south-korea-tests-hundreds-of-thousands-to-fight-virus-outbreak |date=9 March 2020 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seegene-launches-kfda-approved-covid-19-assay-301005858.html Seegene launches KFDA Approved COVID-19 Assay]{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200219191708/https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seegene-launches-kfda-approved-covid-19-assay-301005858.html |date=19 February 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] attributed the factors behind the low death rate of South Korea to the rigorous testing and the infected population profile. South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women.
