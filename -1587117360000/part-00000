In 1984 in Paris he was involved in the foundation of the French HIV/AIDS organisation, [[AIDES]]. During this period, he brought out his novel, ''Caracole'' (1985), which centres on heterosexual relationships. After returning to America White maintained his interest in France and French literature, publishing ''Genet: a biography'' (1993), ''Our Paris: sketches from memory'' (1995), ''Marcel Proust'' (1998), ''The Flaneur: a stroll through the paradoxes of Paris'' (2000) and ''Rimbaud'' (2008).\n\n[[File:Edmund White BBF 2011 Shankbone.JPG|thumb|upright|White at the 2011 [[Brooklyn Book Festival]]]]\n\nThe novel ''The Married Man'' (2000) is gay-themed and draws on White's life. ''Fanny: A Fiction'' (2003) is a historical novel about novelist [[Frances Trollope]] and social reformer [[Frances Wright]] in early 19th-century America. White's 2006 play ''Terre Haute'' (produced in New York City in 2009) portrays discussions that take place when a prisoner, based on terrorist bomber [[Timothy McVeigh]], is visited by a writer based on [[Gore Vidal]]. (In real life McVeigh and Vidal corresponded but did not meet.)\n\nIn 2005 White published his autobiography, ''My Lives'' &mdash; organised by theme rather than chronology &mdash; and in 2009 his memoir of New York life in the 1960s and 1970s, ''City Boy''.\n\nWhite has been influential as a literary and cultural critic, particularly on same-sex love and sexuality.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nHe is currently a professor of creative writing in [[Princeton University]]'s Lewis Center for the Arts.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.princeton.edu/~visarts/cwr/faculty/ewhite.html |title=The Program in Creative Writing, Princeton University |work=princeton.edu |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080305082049/http://www.princeton.edu/~visarts/cwr/faculty/ewhite.html |archivedate=March 5, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In June 2012, White was reported by his husband, [[Michael Carroll (American writer)|Michael Carroll]], to be making 'remarkable' recovery after suffering two strokes in previous months.<ref name=Blade>Reece, Phil.
