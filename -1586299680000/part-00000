According to Campbell & Oblinger (2007), accrediting agencies, [[Government|governments]], [[Parent|parents]] and [[Student|students]] are all calling for the adoption of new modern and efficient ways of improving and monitoring student success. This has ushered the higher education system into an era characterized by increased scrutiny from the various [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. For instance, the Bradley review acknowledges that [[benchmarking]] activities such as student engagement serve as indicators for gauging the institution's quality (Commonwealth [[Government of Australia]], 2008).\n\nIncreased competition, [[accreditation]], assessment and regulation are the major factors encouraging the adoption of analytics in [[higher education]]. Although institutions of higher learning gather much vital data that can significantly aid in solving problems like attrition and retention, the collected data is not being analysed adequately and hence translated into useful data (Goldstein, 2005.) Subsequently, higher education leadership are forced to make critical and vital decisions based on inadequate information that could be achieved by properly utilising and analysing the available data (Norris, Leonard, & strategic Initiatives Inc., 2008). This gives rise to strategic problems. This setback also depicts itself at the tactical level. Learning and teaching at institutions of higher education if often a diverse and complex experience. Each and every teacher, student or course is quite different. However, [[Learning_management_system|LMS]] is tasked with taking care of them all. LMS is at the centre of academic analytics. It records each and every student and staff's information and results in a click within the system. When this crucial information is added, compared and contrasted with different enterprise information systems provides the institution with a vast array of useful information that can be harvested to gain a competitive edge (Dawson & McWilliam, 2008; Goldstein, 2005; Heathcoate & Dawson, 2005).\n\nIn order to retrieve meaningful information from institution sources i.e. LMS, the information has to be correctly interpreted against a basis of educational efficiency, and this action requires analysis from people with learning and teaching skills. Therefore, a collaborative approach is required from both the people guarding the data and those who will interpret it, otherwise the data will remain to be a total waste (Baepler & Murdoch, 2010)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Baepler|first=Paul|date=1 July 2010|title=Academic Analytics and Data Mining in Higher\nEducation|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/7b74/151d40a9072e981080b3103de0abd90bbbba.pdf|journal=international Journal for the scholarship of teaching and learning|volume=4(2)|pages=|via=IJSOTL}}</ref>. Decision making at its most basic level is based on presumption or intuition (a person can make conclusions and decisions based on experience without having to do data analysis) (Siemens & Long, 2011). However, a lot of decisions made at institutions of higher learning are too vital to be based on anecdote, presumption or intuition since significant decisions need to be backed by data and facts.\n\nAnalytics, which is often termed \u201cbusiness intelligence\u201d, has come out as new [[software]] and [[Computer hardware|hardware]] that enables businesses to gather and analyse large amounts of information or data. The analytics process is made up of gathering, analysing, data manipulation and employing the results to answer critical questions such as \u2018why\u2019. Analytics was first applied in the admissions department in higher education institutions. The institutions normally used some formulas to choose students from a large pool of applicants. These formulas drew their information from high school transcripts and standardized test scores. In today's world, analytics is commonly used in administrative units such as fund raising and admissions. The use and application of academic analytics is meant to grow due to the ever-increasing concerns about student success and accountability. Academic analytics primarily marries complex and vast data with [[predictive modelling]] and statistical techniques to better decision making. Current academic analytics initiatives are bent to use data to predict students experiencing difficulty (Arnold, & Pistilli, 2012, April)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://evidence.laceproject.eu/?evidence=course-signals-at-purdue-using-learning-analytics-to-increase-student-success|title=Course Signals at Purdue: Using Learning Analytics to Increase Student Success|website=LACE Evidence Hub|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>. This allows advisors and faculty members to intervene by tailoring procedures which will meet the student's learning needs (Arnold, 2010)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://er.educause.edu/articles/2010/3/signals-applying-academic-analytics|title=Signals: Applying Academic Analytics|website=er.educause.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>. As such, academic analytics possesses the ability to improve learning, student success and teaching. Analytics has become a valuable tool for institutions because of its ability to predict, model and improve decision making.\n\n== Analytic Steps ==\n\nAnalysis is composed of five basic steps: capture, report, predict, act and refine\nCapture: All analytic efforts are centred on data. Consequently, academic analytics can be rooted in data from various sources such as a CMS, and financial systems (Campbell, Finnegan,  & Collins, 2006). Additionally, the data comes in various different formats for example [[Spreadsheet|spread sheets]]. Also, data can be got from the institution's external environment. To capture data, academic analytics needs to determine the type of available data, methods of harnessing it and the formats it is in. \nReport: After the data has been captured and stored in a central location, analysts will examine the data, perform [[Information retrieval|queries]], identify patterns, trends and exceptions depicted by the data. The standard deviation and mean ([[descriptive statistics]]) are mostly generated.\n\nPredict: After analysing the warehoused data through the use of statistics, a [[Predictive modelling|predictive model]] is developed. These models vary depending on the question nature and type of data. To develop a probability, these models employ [[Regression analysis|statistical regression]] concepts and techniques. Predictions are made after the use of statistical algorithms.\n\nAct:  The major goal and aim of analytics is to enable the institution to take actions based on the probabilities and predictions made. These actions might vary from invention to information. The interventions to address problems might be in the form of a personal email, phone call or an automated contact from faculty advisors about study resources and skills, such as office hours or help sessions. Undoubtedly, institutions have to come up with appropriate mechanisms for impact measurement; such as did the students actually respond or attend the help sessions when invited.\nRefine: Academic analytics should also be made up of a process aimed at self-improvement. Statistics processes should be continually updated since the measurement of project impacts is not a one-time static effort but rather a continual effort. For instance, admission analytics should be updated or revised yearly.\n\n===Comprehending Involved Stakeholders===\nAnalytics affects executive officers, students, faculty members, IT staff and student affairs staff. Whereas students will be keen to know academic analytics will affect their grades, faculty members will be interested in finding out how the information and data can be appropriated for other purposes (Pistilli, Arnold & Bethune, 2012). Moreover, the institution staff will be focussed on finding how the analysis will enable them to effectively accomplish their jobs while the institution president will be focussed on freshman retention and increase in graduation rates.\n\n== Criticisms ==\n\nAnalytics have been criticised for various reasons such as profiling. Their main use is to profile students into successful and unsuccessful categories. However, some individuals argue that profiling of students tends to bias people's behaviours and expectations (Ferguson, 2012). Additionally, there is no clear guidelines on which profiling issues should be prohibited or allowed in institutions of higher learning.\n\n==References==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100726103616/http://www.educause.edu/Resources/Browse/Academic%20Analytics/16930 Academic Analytics] in the [[EDUCAUSE]] Resource Library\n* Arnold, K.

His father [[Boris Parygin]] was a [[Social psychology|social psychologist]]. Alexey studied at the Graphics Faculty of the [[Herzen University]] from 1982\u20131989. He organized the art group \u201cUnion \u2116 0\u201d in Leningrad in 1986-1989 and created the art squatters\u2019 studio \u201cNevsky 25\u201d in Leningrad in 1987\u20131990. Joined the [[Saint Petersburg Union of Artists|Professional Artists\u2019 Union of Russia]] in 1994, the Art Critics Association (ACA) member since 2003.\n[[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in Art History with the thesis \u201c[[Screen printing|Silk Screening]] as a phenomenon of the 20th Century art\u201d (2002).\n\n===The nature of creativity===\nIn 1980-1990 Parygin concentrated on easel [[oil painting]] outside and using  models at the studio, experimented with various paint foundations such as canvas, plywood, glass and other media and used texture and relief techniques. \nFrom [[Aleksandr Kamensky]]\u2019s article:\n{{quote|\n\u201cThe works create new poetry, which involuntarily rivals with habitual esthetic stereotypes. For instance, we accept as a common notion to worship joyously the classic beauty of St. Petersburg, its harmony and stately grandeur. This exposition does have variations of that sort. But observe \u201cNight Nevsky\u201d by Parygin. Rough to the touch texture, dark abyss. In the darkness urgent lights explode. They bring forth immediate spiritual angst. One does not regard the regal magnificence of the urban landscape-it is neither cast aside, nor left behind the curtains, as dramatism of  modern perception takes over. One regards not a city museum for curious crowds, but one beholds the habitat of our days where we seek, love, fight, suffer.

The intimate relationships between text and image is enhanced when author and artist are one and the same person and engage in an inter-art discourse that leads to creations that are truly unified works of art. An artist who achieved equal mastery in more than one medium and made different arts merge in his personality was no doubt Alexey Parygin. His poetic collections <...> represent an attempt to synthesize text and plastic figurative form in books where literary and visual languages are calculated to have a simultaneous effect on the reader/viewer. The work of Alexey Parygin have common features that are not accidental as the books were created at more or less the same time.\u201d<ref>Grigoryants El.

His father [[Boris Parygin]] was a [[Social psychology|social psychologist]]. Alexey studied at the Graphics Faculty of the [[Herzen University]] from 1982\u20131989. He organized the art group \u201cUnion \u2116 0\u201d in Leningrad in 1986-1989 and created the art squatters\u2019 studio \u201cNevsky 25\u201d in Leningrad in 1987\u20131990.

For instance, we accept as a common notion to worship joyously the classic beauty of St. Petersburg, its harmony and stately grandeur. This exposition does have variations of that sort. But observe \u201cNight Nevsky\u201d by Parygin. Rough to the touch texture, dark abyss. In the darkness urgent lights explode. They bring forth immediate spiritual angst. One does not regard the regal magnificence of the urban landscape-it is neither cast aside, nor left behind the curtains, as dramatism of  modern perception takes over. One regards not a city museum for curious crowds, but one beholds the habitat of our days where we seek, love, fight, suffer.

A year later in 1997, two additional cars were purchased.  To generate additional revenues, the company started in 1899 a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\nIn 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company'' and four years later in 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new company called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, the company could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute that electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would generate additional revenues by providing its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters which it powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.   \n\nIn 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility, and it was not until forty years later in 1977, did [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decide to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$ 4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors, which were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity, including Cornwall.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the power dam to the city were for the first time powered with electricity generated by the local power plant.  There were three wires and all were weighed down and covered with ice.  Two of the three wires were dangerously close to each other, until a Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires, allowing workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other. For the first and only time in history, this permitted [[Ontario Hydro]] with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the 1998 ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds and later in 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$ 25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, the fund was also setup to only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.

The cost of the project was CA$3 million which along with its financing would be recouped from the energy savings in switching to LED coupled with a lower maintenance cost.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2016/04/11/5000-city-street-lights-being-replaced-with-led/|title=5,000 city street lights being replaced with LED|date=2016-04-11|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted the Township of Glengarry to LED bulbs at a cost of CA$226 thousand, yielding a cost savings of sixty-nine percent, and collecting CA$259 thousand in savings in the first three years.\n\n=== Contraversy ===\nIn 2019 the Township of Glengarry wanted Cornwall Electric to also convert its sub-division of Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/03/12/glen-walter-held-hostage-to-old-streetlights/|title=Glen Walter held hostage to old streetlights|last=Editor|date=2019-03-12|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  At a special council meeting on January 24 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of [[Eastern Ontario]] and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity, including Cornwall.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the power dam to the city were for the first time powered with electricity generated by the local power plant.  There were three wires and all were weighed down and covered with ice.  Two of the three wires were dangerously close to each other, until a Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires, allowing workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other. For the first and only time in history, this permitted [[Ontario Hydro]] with its local hydroelectric power generating station, to provide Cornwall Electric and Cornwall residents, with enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the 1998 ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds and later in 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$ 25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|date=May 7, 2019|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, the fund was also setup to only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.  Over the years, interest generated by the fund has been used in part for the redevelopment of the Hotel Dieu Hospital, the establishment of a [[hospice]], the building of an aquatic centre, and for mortgage payments on the city's new sports complex the Benson Centre.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/09/24/cornwall-hit-sweet-spot-in-98-sale-of-cornwall-electric/|title=Cornwall hit \u2018sweet spot\u2019 in \u201998 sale of Cornwall Electric|last=Editor|date=2019-09-24|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>\n\n=== Fortis Inc. ===\nIn May 2002, [[Enbridge|Enbridge Energy Distribution Inc.]] announced that it had agreed to sell ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' to [[Fortis Inc.|Fortic Inc.]] in a cash deal worth CA$67 million. Both the Canadian [[Competition Bureau (Canada)|Competition Bureau]] and the Ontario Energy Board approved the sale which Fortis Inc. concluded on October 18, 2002.\u00a0 Fortis Inc. which has its roots in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John Newfoundland]] and is today an international company, operates Cornwall Electric under its Ontario subsidiary, Fortis Ontario Inc.\n\n=== LED lighting ===\nIn 2016, after an initial test run in certain areas, the City of Cornwall which still owns the utility poles and lights, contracted crews to convert approximate 5,000 street lamps that were using the older [[Sodium-vapor lamp|sodium-vapour lamps]] which typically lasted six years, to the more energy efficient [[LED lamp|LED bulbs]] that could last as long as twenty years.  The cost of the project was CA$3 million which along with its financing would be recouped from the energy savings in switching to LED coupled with a lower maintenance cost.  The city also announced that it would be switching its street traffic lights to LED at a rate of two intersections per year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2016/04/11/5000-city-street-lights-being-replaced-with-led/|title=5,000 city street lights being replaced with LED|date=2016-04-11|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> In 2017, [[Hydro One]] converted the Township of Glengarry to LED bulbs at a cost of CA$226 thousand, yielding a cost savings of sixty-nine percent, and collecting CA$259 thousand in savings in the first three years.\n\n=== Contraversy ===\nIn 2019 the Township of Glengarry wanted Cornwall Electric to also convert its sub-division of Glen Walter to LED lighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/03/12/glen-walter-held-hostage-to-old-streetlights/|title=Glen Walter held hostage to old streetlights|last=Editor|date=2019-03-12|website=Cornwall Newswatch|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>  At a special council meeting on January 24 2020, Councillor Sam McDonell raised the idea of not paying its electricity bill, as a way to bring Cornwall Electric to the table to discuss the matter.  In an email published in the [[Cornwall Seaway News]], the councillor stated:  \u201c''The big issue is this is a real savings that once we have transferred maintenance and future replacement cost to reserves we can then pass that savings along to rate payers, who in fact have these lights worked into their property taxes. It\u2019s a true savings we miss out on every month we pay the bill and Cornwall Electric doesn\u2019t come to the table''.\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallseawaynews.com/2020/01/27/sg-council-considers-not-paying-cornwall-electric-bill/|title=SG Council considers not paying Cornwall Electric bill|date=2020-01-27|website=Cornwall Seaway News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Cornwall, Ontario]]\n* [[Cornwall Street Railway]]\n* [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]]\n\n== Footnote ==\nAs of 2017, the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) no longer includes Cornwall Ontario in its [https://www.oeb.ca/_html/performance/rates_chart.php electricity rate comparison charts].\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.cornwallelectric.com/ Official website]\n* [https://www.facebook.com/Cornwall-Electric-407144872778622/ Facebook site]\n* [https://twitter.com/CE_electric?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor Twitter site]\n* [https://theseeker.ca/2017/02/history-cornwall-cotton-mills/ History of the Cornwall Cotton Mills]\n\n{{portalbar|Canada|Companies|Lists}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Canadian electric utilities}}\n[[Category:Electric power-related lists]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "Moved text related to transmission from the lead paragraph under a new header \"Transmission\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornwall_Electric"}

Originally the tower was surrounded by a limestone wall and outbuildings, forming a courtyard. The tower itself is conical and four storeys high. Only the second storey was intended to be used as living quarters in times of war or unrest. On this floor, a bed alcove is found in the wall, as well as a fireplace and latrine which are also present on the other storeys. All the other storeys had purely defensive purposes, including [[embrasure]]s of 11 different shapes, and were connected by a spiral staircase running through the thick wall. The reconstructed [[Hoarding (castles)|hoarding]] that surrounds the third storey is unique in Estonia.\n\nThe tower was damaged during the [[Livonian War]] and subsequently used as an outbuilding for the local manor house.

Over time, the group grew in number and expanded its activities by taking on educational responsibilities as well. After establishing \"Midreshet B'Yahad\", a Seminar Center of Judaism, Society and Zionism Studies, the group realized the need for a [[yeshiva]] as the next step in strengthening the existing projects by bringing youth to Yeruham.\n\nThe leader of this group, Shmuel Friedman Ben-Shalom, approached [[:he:\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5_\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2|Rabbi Eliyhau Blumenzweig]], who at the time taught at [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], with a proposition to be the Rosh Yeshiva, which he accepted.

A typical day in Yeshiva will include two sessions of intensive Talmud study (''iyun'') and one of extensive study (''bekiut''). \n\nShachris at the Yeshiva is at 6:30am, followed by halachah seder until 8:00am. Breakfast is from 8:00am-8:30am. After breakfast is morning seder, which is typically gemara iyun, and it goes from 8:30am-1:00pm. Following morning seder is lunch and a break from 1:00pm-3pm. Mincha is at 3:00pm, followed by afternoon seder, from about 3:20pm-7:30pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah. Many of the students use the entire afternoon seder for learning machshava, tanach, mussar, and emmunah. From 7:30pm-8:00pm is Maariv, followed by supper from 8:00pm-8:30pm. Night seder consists of learning bekiut, and it goes from 8:30pm until at least 11:00pm, although there is no given time for night seder to end, and many students learn until much later.[[File:Hayeshiva.jpg|thumb|Lunch room of the Yeshiva]]'''Daily Schedule''': \n\nShachrit: 6:30am-8:00am\n\nBreakfast: 8:00am-8:30am\n\nMorning seder: 8:30am-1:00pm\n\nLunch/break: 1:00pm-3:00pm\n\nMincha: 3:00pm-3:20pm\n\nAfternoon seder: 3:20pm-7:30pm\n\nSupper: 7:30pm-8:00pm\n\nMarriv: 8:00pm-8:30pm \n\nNight seder: 8:30pm-11:00pm (or later)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/26/46/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd|last=|first=|date=|website=www.yhy.co.il|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of the afternoon seder, the yeshiva guides its students to base their perspective upon the teachings of [[Yehuda Halevi|Rabbi Yehuda Halevi]] and the [[Judah Loew ben Bezalel|Maharal of Prague]] in accordance with the ideology of [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], as is often customary in Religious Zionist yeshivas. With the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an observant Jews in modern time in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of Jewish scholars such as [[Maimonides]], [[Nachmanides]], [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] and many more.\n\n==Educational approach==\nThe yeshiva educates its students to be aware of their surroundings and attentive to the needs of society in general. The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to [[:he:\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5_\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2|Rabbi Blumenzweig]], the other rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva are  Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.

Breakfast is from 8:00am-8:30am. After breakfast is morning seder, which is typically gemara iyun, and it goes from 8:30am-1:00pm. Following morning seder is lunch and a break from 1:00pm-3pm. Mincha is at 3:00pm, followed by afternoon seder, from about 3:20pm-7:30pm. Afternoon seder consists of more iyun gemara, followed by a couple hours of emmunah.

With the goal of educating students to deal independently with the challenges they face living as an observant Jews in modern time in mind, the yeshiva encourages a broader study of Biblical, rabbinic, and other classical and modern sources. Hence, the yeshiva curriculum contains weekly classes in [[Tanakh]], [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Hasidic philosophy]], and the works of Jewish scholars such as [[Maimonides]], [[Nachmanides]], [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], [[Joseph B.

The yeshiva believes that the keys to solving Israel\u2019s socioeconomic gaps lie in integration and education. All the students volunteer in the community mainly in the field of education. Many of the yeshiva's alumni settle in Yeruham instead of heading to the country's central cities.\n\nThe yeshiva also promotes other programs, among them:\n* ''Ye'adim'' (goals) - Concern of the Ethiopian Jewry in Israel's situation led Yerucham students to create a leadership training program for Ethiopian students with the intention of their returning to their communities. During the 5 years of Hesder the students synchronize their full Yeshiva studies with a [[Bachelor of Education|B.Ed.]] degree in [[Herzog College]].\n* Young Study Partners - First and second year students dedicate 2 hours weekly to studying Torah subjects with children from the local elementary school. They also serve as positive role models for the local youth and look to form a connection with their families.\n* Charity Fund - The goal of the Fund is to help the needy of Yeruham become self-sufficient and better managers of their money. The Fund uses the cooperation of the local welfare and professional financial advisors to this end.\n* ''B'levav Shalem'' Yeshiva High School \u2013 Because of the lack of high quality religious high schools in the [[Negev]], and as a part of the integration program the Hesder Yeshiva believes in, it was decided by alumni, residents of Yerucham, to open a Yeshiva High School for the local and general population.\n\n==Educational staff==\n[[File:\u05d4\u05e8\u05d1 \u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2.JPG|thumb|Rabbi Blumenzweig]]\nIn addition to [[:he:\u05d0\u05dc\u05d9\u05d4\u05d5_\u05d1\u05dc\u05d5\u05de\u05e0\u05e6\u05d5\u05d9\u05d2|Rabbi Blumenzweig]], the other rabbis who teach in the Yeshiva are  Rabbis [[Uriel Eitam]], Chaim Wolfson, Shai Gnizi, Shmuel Gleizer, Achiya Ben Pazi, Shmuel Ariel and Elyakim Sharir<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.yhy.co.il/content/blogcategory/33/51/lang,he/|title=\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05ea \u05d4\u05d4\u05e1\u05d3\u05e8 \u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05d7\u05dd - \u05e6\u05d5\u05d5\u05ea \u05d4\u05d9\u05e9\u05d9\u05d1\u05d4|website=www.yhy.co.il|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>.
