Dagdeviren is the first Turkish scientist in the history of the Harvard Society to become a Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard University. As a faculty member, she directs her own Conformable Decoders research group at the [[MIT Media Lab]].<ref name=\"cd\"/> The group works at the intersection of materials science, engineering and biomedical engineering. They create mechanically adaptive electromechanical systems that can intimately integrate with the target object of interest for sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting, among other applications.<ref name=\"cd\">{{cite web|url=https://conformabledecoders.media.mit.edu/mission.html|title=Conformable Decoders|accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref> Dagdeviren believes that vital information from nature and the human body is \u201ccoded\u201d in various forms of physical patterns. Her research focuses on the creation of conformable decoders that can \u201cdecode\u201d these patterns into beneficial signals and/or energy.<ref name=\"cd\" /> \n\n==Early life==\nCanan Da\u011fdeviren was born in [[Istanbul]], Turkey on May 4, 1985. She is the oldest of three, and has two younger brothers. She completed her primary education in [[\u0130zmit]], where she also attended middle school. However, her family was forced to leave the city after the [[1999 \u0130zmit earthquake]], and she continued her high school education in [[Adana]].\n\nDagdeviren was drawn to scientific exploration from a very young age. In an interview with Discover Magazine, she recalls being fascinated by smashing rocks together and producing sparks, saying \u201cI loved the idea that you deform this material and create sparks -- it was very exciting.\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/how-flexible-sensors-might-begin-to-read-the-bodys-language|title=How Flexible Sensors Might Begin to Read the Body's Language|website=Discover Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> Another source of inspiration came from a book that her father gave her on the life of Marie Curie. She quickly became infatuated not just with Curie's work, but also with the research conducted by her husband Pierre Curie, who Dagdeviren considers her \u201cscientific love.\u201d Pierre and his brother Jacques first described [[piezoelectricity]] in 1880,<ref name=\":2\" /> a concept that would later serve as the driving force behind many of Dagdeviren's own projects and applications.\n\nFinally, at the heart of her work is Dagdeviren's own family. An early source of inspiration was learning about her grandfather, who died of heart failure at age 28. Even as a young girl, she promised herself that someday she would create technology that would decode and monitor similar health issues to honor his memory.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Education & Academic Career==\nCanan Dagdeviren studied [[Physics Engineering]] at the [[Hacettepe University]] in [[Ankara]], graduating in 2007. She obtained a [[Master of Science]] degree from [[Sabanc\u0131 University]] in Istanbul, and won a [[Fulbright scholarship]] for study in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tr.usembassy.gov/canan_dagdeviren_story_2015/|title=Canan Dagdeviren - An Inspiring Story|date=2015-01-17|website=U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Turkey|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> With this scholarship, she chose to conduct research in [[materials science]] and engineering at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign]], where she focused on exploring patterning techniques and creating piezoelectric biomedical systems. Here, one of the projects that she developed was a conformable, piezoelectric, energy harvester that converts mechanical energy from internal organ movements into electric energy to power medical devices. It is soft and flexible and conforms to the heart as well as other soft tissues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencemag.org/prize/scilifelab/canan-dagdeviren|title=Canan Dagdeviren|date=2016-12-01|website=Science {{!}} AAAS|language=en|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> This technology could extend the battery life of implanted electronics or eliminate the need for battery replacement, sparing patients from repeated operations and the risk of surgical complications.

Dagdeviren is the first Turkish scientist in the history of the Harvard Society to become a Junior Fellow in the Society of Fellows at Harvard University. As a faculty member, she directs her own Conformable Decoders research group at the [[MIT Media Lab]].<ref name=\"cd\"/> The group works at the intersection of materials science, engineering and biomedical engineering. They create mechanically adaptive electromechanical systems that can intimately integrate with the target object of interest for sensing, actuation, and energy harvesting, among other applications.<ref name=\"cd\">{{cite web|url=https://conformabledecoders.media.mit.edu/mission.html|title=Conformable Decoders|accessdate=10 February 2020}}</ref> Dagdeviren believes that vital information from nature and the human body is \u201ccoded\u201d in various forms of physical patterns. Her research focuses on the creation of conformable decoders that can \u201cdecode\u201d these patterns into beneficial signals and/or energy.<ref name=\"cd\" /> \n\n==Early life==\nCanan Da\u011fdeviren was born in [[Istanbul]], Turkey on May 4, 1985. She is the oldest of three, and has two younger brothers. She completed her primary education in [[\u0130zmit]], where she also attended middle school. However, her family was forced to leave the city after the [[1999 \u0130zmit earthquake]], and she continued her high school education in [[Adana]].\n\nDagdeviren was drawn to scientific exploration from a very young age. In an interview with Discover Magazine, she recalls being fascinated by smashing rocks together and producing sparks, saying \u201cI loved the idea that you deform this material and create sparks -- it was very exciting.\u201d<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.discovermagazine.com/technology/how-flexible-sensors-might-begin-to-read-the-bodys-language|title=How Flexible Sensors Might Begin to Read the Body's Language|website=Discover Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> Another source of inspiration came from a book that her father gave her on the life of Marie Curie. She quickly became infatuated not just with Curie's work, but also with the research conducted by her husband Pierre Curie, who Dagdeviren considers her \u201cscientific love.\u201d Pierre and his brother Jacques first described [[piezoelectricity]] in 1880,<ref name=\":2\" /> a concept that would later serve as the driving force behind many of Dagdeviren's own projects and applications.\n\nFinally, at the heart of her work is Dagdeviren's own family. An early source of inspiration was learning about her grandfather, who died of heart failure at age 28. Even as a young girl, she promised herself that someday she would create technology that would decode and monitor similar health issues to honor his memory.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Education & Academic Career==\nCanan Dagdeviren studied [[Physics Engineering]] at the [[Hacettepe University]] in [[Ankara]], graduating in 2007. She obtained a [[Master of Science]] degree from [[Sabanc\u0131 University]] in Istanbul, and won a [[Fulbright scholarship]] for study in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tr.usembassy.gov/canan_dagdeviren_story_2015/|title=Canan Dagdeviren - An Inspiring Story|date=2015-01-17|website=U.S. Embassy & Consulates in Turkey|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-10}}</ref> With this scholarship, she chose to conduct research in [[materials science]] and engineering at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign]], where she focused on exploring patterning techniques and creating piezoelectric biomedical systems. Here, one of the projects that she developed was a conformable, piezoelectric, energy harvester that converts mechanical energy from internal organ movements into electric energy to power medical devices.
