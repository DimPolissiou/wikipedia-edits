International]] cricket match between the [[England women's cricket team]] and the [[New Zealand women's national cricket team]], played on 22 March 2009 at the [[North Sydney Oval]] in Australia. It was the culmination of the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. England won the final by four [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|wickets]], clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England. It was the second time that the two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup \u2013 England won their previous final contest in 1993.\n\nBoth teams were unbeaten in the first group stage. In the second, known as the Super Sixes, New Zealand and England finished first and second to qualify directly for the final; New Zealand had only lost to England, while England had already guaranteed their place in the final when they lost their last match to Australia. England were considered the favourites for the final. The New Zealand [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], [[Haidee Tiffen]], won the [[Toss (cricket)|toss]], and opted to [[Batting (cricket)|bat]] first. Her side were [[bowled out]] for 166 [[Run (cricket)|runs]]. The [[all-rounder]] [[Lucy Doolan]], batting at [[Batting order (cricket)|number nine]], was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. [[Nicky Shaw]], one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]] to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named [[Player of the Match awards (cricket)|player of the match]] having replaced the injured [[Jenny Gunn]] just minutes before the game started.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Women's Cricket World Cup}}\nThe [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], and the first to be organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802230336/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |title=Women's Cricket |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2 August 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>{{efn|The ICC took over administration of the women's game in 2005, when it merged with the [[International Women's Cricket Council]] (IWCC).<ref>{{cite book |title=Routledge Handbook of Global Sport |editor1-last=Nauright |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Zipp |editor2-first=Sarah |year=2020 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |p=202 |isbn=978-1-138-88723-7}}</ref>}} The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Skirting the Boundary: A History of Women's Cricket |last=Duncan |first=Isabelle |year=2013 |publisher=[[The Robson Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84954-546-4 |page=139}}</ref> The 2009 tournament included eight teams;

{"title_page": "Henry Burnell", "text_new": "{{for| his grandson, the Irish politician, playwright and landowner|Henry Burnell (author)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n\n'''Henry Burnell''' (c. 1540\u20131614) was an Irish judge and politician; he served briefly as  [[Recorder of Dublin]] and  as a justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)|Court of King's Bench]]. Though he was  willing to accept Crown office, he spent much of his career in opposition to  the Government. He was one of the leaders of the protest against the  policies of  the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir [[Henry Sidney]],  in the late 1570s, and as a member of the [[Irish House of Commons]] in the 1580s  he successfully opposed  Sidney's successor, Sir [[John Perrot]]. In the early 1600s he was one of the leaders of the protest against strict enforcement of the [[Penal Laws]]. His professional reputation was gravely  damaged in his later years when he was convicted and fined  for having altered a deed concerning the proper disposition of the  11th  Earl of Kildare's estate. He was the grandfather of the playwright Henry Burnell.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Castleknock]], County [[Dublin]], son of John Burnell.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'' John Murray London 1926 p.223</ref> The Burnells were a long-established Dublin  family, which had settled at [[Balgriffin]]; they  were descended from Robert Burnell, who was a Baron of the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)]] between about 1388 and 1413.<ref>Ball p.223</ref> An earlier [[John Burnell]] was briefly [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]] in the 1490s. The family were staunchly   Roman Catholic and their loyalty to the Crown was sometimes questioned as a result. Henry's father had managed to retain his  estates after his cousin, another  John  Burnell, had been executed for his part in the rebellion of [[Silken Thomas]] in the 1530s. The  elder Henry  was still alive, although described as \"very old\", in 1577. Henry was at [[Lincoln's Inn]]  in 1561-2 and was one of a group of  Irish students who compiled a book detailing the maladministration of [[the Pale]]. He returned to Ireland to practice law about 1564.\n\nIn 1573 he was appointed Recorder of Dublin but resigned  little over a year later. His motives are unclear but since he emerged soon after as legal adviser to [[Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare|the Earl of Kildare]] it is likely that he found private practice more lucrative.<ref name=\"Ball\">Ball, p.223</ref> Even Sir Henry Sidney, a stern critic of Burnell, admitted that there was no doubt of  his  great success at the Bar, which had made him a rich man.<ref>[[Richard Bagwell]]  ''Ireland Under the Tudors''  London Longman Greens  3 Volumes 1885-90  Vol. II p.329</ref>\n\n==Cess controversy==\nThe ''cess'', a tax levied on the landowners   of  [[the Pale]],  supposedly for military purposes, had always been unpopular, and Burnell had denounced it as early as 1562. In 1576 the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], Henry Sidney, announced ambitious plans to reform and extend it. The landowners of the Pale protested that the cost would be ruinous.<ref>Bagwell pp.328-9</ref> Burnell was  one of a deputation of eminent lawyers chosen to petition [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] directly against the cess, the others being [[Richard Netterville]] and [[Barnaby Skurloke or Skurlog|Barnaby Skurlock]]. The mission went badly; Elizabeth took grave  offence at the challenge to her [[royal prerogative]] and at Sidney's urging  she imprisoned the three lawyers in the [[Fleet Prison]]. Given his family's previous  association with [[Silken Thomas]] Burnell was vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty.  Sidney, while grudgingly calling him the most honest of the three lawyers (if only he would stay out of politics), accused him of being a \"perverse Papist\" with  \"a great thirst to rid his country of the English.\"<ref name=\"Bagwell p.329\">Bagwell p.329</ref>  As opposition to Sidney's plans mounted and he began thinking of  asking for his   recall to England, the tension eased and the three lawyers  were freed in return for  making an abject apology.<ref>Nolan, Pierce Laurence \"Richard Netterville\" ''Dictionary of National Biography 1885\u20131900 Vol.40'' pp.237\u20138</ref>\n\n==Parliament of 1585==\nBurnell and Richard Netterville returned to their opposition role in the Irish Parliament of 1585,  to which Burnell had been returned as  a [[knight of the shire]] for [[Dublin County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Dublin]]. The new Lord Deputy Sir John Perrot, like Sidney before him,  had an ambitious reform program, but the opposition thwarted him at every opportunity, even insisting on examining his accounts, for which Perrot wished them \"foul scorn\". He imprisoned some of the opposition members,  but was unable to get his  legislative program passed.<ref>Crawford, Jon.G  ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland -the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641'' Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p246</ref>\n\nSomewhat surprisingly Burnell was once more appointed to the Bench in 1590 as third justice of the King's Bench.<ref name=\"Ball\" /> However he served only for a single term, which may suggest  that it was only a temporary office, or that doubts had once more been raised about his loyalty.\n\n==Penal laws==\nBurnell was a staunch [[Roman Catholic]] and strongly objected to the [[Anglican]] settlement; in 1605-6 he was one of the strongest supporters of [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick Barnewall]] in his protest against the fines imposed for failure to attend [[Anglican]] service and the use of the [[Court of Castle Chamber]] to impose religious conformity. Yet again he was arrested but, probably because of his age,  he was not imprisoned.<ref>Kenny, Colum ''The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland'' Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.66</ref>\n\n==''Digby v Earl of Kildare''==\nIn his last years his  professional reputation  suffered  greatly from the reopening of the Kildare inheritance dispute which  had begun 20 years earlier. [[Lettice Digby, 1st Baroness Offaly]] was the granddaughter and heir general of Burnell's old client the 11th Earl of Kildare and his wife [[Mabel Browne]]. Lettice and her husband deeply resented the fact that the great bulk of the Kildare inheritance had passed first to her uncle and then to her cousin [[Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Kildare]]. By 1602 she had learned that a crucial [[deed]] supposedly executed by her grandfather, who died in 1585, might have been forged or tampered with by his widow. She and her husband [[Robert Digby (courtier)|Sir Robert Digby]] then sued both the  present Earl and the aged Dowager Countess. The case went on for over a decade and involved numerous hearings in several different courts.<ref>Crawford, p.493</ref>\n\nIn 1608 the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], the  Irish equivalent of [[Star Chamber]],  began an inquiry into the [[forgery]] allegation, which transformed a private lawsuit into a matter concerning the Crown.<ref>Something the Court came to regret, since the case was so complex that for two law terms it was unable to deal with any other business: Crawford pp.293-5</ref> The old Countess admitted that she had consulted Burnell in 1585 about the deed, fearing that it did not  adequately protect her [[jointure]], and that Burnell had advised that it did not give adequate protection but that he would make the necessary alterations.<ref>Crawford pp.494\u20135</ref> Burnell himself admitted to having advised on making some alterations \"but without offence\" (presumably he meant without criminal intent). The Chamber acquitted the Countess of any crime, but found Burnell guilty of [[forgery]], a \"grave offence deserving severe punishment\". He was subjected to a heavy fine and to be imprisoned at the Crown's pleasure, although it does not seem the latter penalty was carried out.<ref>Crawford p.496</ref>\n\nJon Crawford  in his detailed analysis  of the trial cautions against placing too much reliance on evidence from witnesses who were describing the events of more than 20 years past.<ref>Crawford p.151</ref> Nonetheless Burnell did admit to having advised that the deed could be altered.  Such behaviour from an eminent lawyer, whom even his critics admitted  an honest man, seems extraordinary, but the Kildares were his most important clients and he may have wished to retain the Countess' business by obliging her in the matter of the deed.\n\n==Family==\nBurnell married into the O'Reilly family of [[Cavan]]; his wife died in 1605. Of their children only one  son Christopher reached adulthood. Christopher was the father of [[Henry Burnell (author)|Henry Burnell the younger]], who was a leader of the [[Irish Confederacy]] and a well-known author, best remembered for his play ''Landgartha''.<ref name=\"Ball_a\">Ball p.224</ref>\n\n==Death and reputation==\nBurnell died at Castleknock in 1614. He was remembered as one of the best orators and most eminent lawyers of his time. He was somewhat vain about  his  legal  ability, and  was said to boast of his power to  invariably persuade  judges to find in his favour.<ref name=\"Ball_a\" /> Despite the Kildare scandal, he was generally considered  to be an honest man, as even Sir Henry Sidney,  one of his sternest  critics, admitted.<ref name=\"Bagwell p.329\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burnell, Henry}}\n[[Category:1540s births]]\n[[Category:1614 deaths]]\n[[Category:Politicians from County Dublin]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n[[Category:Irish MPs 1585\u20131586]]\n[[Category:Recorders of Dublin]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Dublin constituencies]]\n", "text_old": "{{for| his grandson, the Irish politician, playwright and landowner|Henry Burnell (author)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n\n'''Henry Burnell''' (c. 1540\u20131614) was an Irish judge and politician; he served briefly as  [[Recorder of Dublin]] and  as a justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)|Court of King's Bench]].

Elrington ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'' John Murray London 1926 p.223</ref> The Burnells were a long-established Dublin  family, which had settled at [[Balgriffin]]; they  were descended from Robert Burnell, who was a Baron of the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)]] between about 1388 and 1413.<ref>Ball p.223</ref> An earlier [[John Burnell]] was briefly [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]] in the 1490s. The family were staunchly   Roman Catholic and their loyalty to the Crown was sometimes questioned as a result. Henry's father had managed to retain his  estates after his cousin, another  John  Burnell, had been executed for his part in the rebellion of [[Silken Thomas]] in the 1530s; the elder Henry  was still alive, although described as \"very old\", in 1577. Henry was at [[Lincoln's Inn]]  in 1561-2 and was one of a group of  Irish students who compiled a book detailing the maladministration of [[the Pale]]. He returned to Ireland to practice law about 1564.\n\nIn 1573 he was appointed Recorder of Dublin but resigned  little over a year later. His motives are unclear but since he emerged soon after as legal adviser to [[Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare|the Earl of Kildare]] it is likely that he found private practice more lucrative.<ref name=\"Ball\">Ball, p.223</ref> Even Sir Henry Sidney, a stern critic of Burnell, admitted that there was no doubt of  his  great success at the Bar, which had made him a rich man.<ref>[[Richard Bagwell]]  ''Ireland Under the Tudors''  London Longman Greens  3 Volumes 1885-90  Vol. II p.329</ref>\n\n==Cess controversy==\nThe ''cess'', a tax levied on the landowners   of  [[the Pale]],  supposedly for military purposes, had always been unpopular, and Burnell had denounced it as early as 1562. In 1576 the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], Henry Sidney, announced ambitious plans to reform and extend it. The landowners of the Pale protested that the cost would be ruinous.<ref>Bagwell pp.328-9</ref> Burnell was  one of a deputation of eminent lawyers chosen to petition [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] directly against the cess, the others being [[Richard Netterville]] and [[Barnaby Skurloke or Skurlog|Barnaby Skurlock]]. The mission went badly; Elizabeth took grave  offence at the challenge to her [[royal prerogative]] and at Sidney's urging  she imprisoned the three lawyers in the [[Fleet Prison]]. Given his family's previous  association with [[Silken Thomas]] Burnell was vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty.  Sidney, while grudgingly calling him the most honest of the three lawyers (if only he would stay out of politics), accused him of being a \"perverse Papist\" with  \"a great thirst to rid his country of the English.\"<ref name=\"Bagwell p.329\">Bagwell p.329</ref>  As opposition to Sidney's plans mounted and he began thinking of  asking for his   recall to England, the tension eased and the three lawyers  were freed in return for  making an abject apology.<ref>Nolan, Pierce Laurence \"Richard Netterville\" ''Dictionary of National Biography 1885\u20131900 Vol.40'' pp.237\u20138</ref>\n\n==Parliament of 1585==\nBurnell and Richard Netterville returned to their opposition role in the Irish Parliament of 1585,  to which Burnell had been returned as  a [[knight of the shire]] for [[Dublin County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Dublin]]. The new Lord Deputy Sir John Perrot, like Sidney before him,  had an ambitious reform program, but the opposition thwarted him at every opportunity, even insisting on examining his accounts, for which Perrot wished them \"foul scorn\". He imprisoned some of the opposition members,  but was unable to get his  legislative program passed.<ref>Crawford, Jon.G  ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland -the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641'' Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p246</ref>\n\nSomewhat surprisingly Burnell was once more appointed to the Bench in 1590 as third justice of the King's Bench.<ref name=\"Ball\" /> However he served only for a single term, which may suggest  that it was only a temporary office, or that doubts had once more been raised about his loyalty.\n\n==Penal laws==\nBurnell was a staunch [[Roman Catholic]] and strongly objected to the [[Anglican]] settlement; in 1605-6 he was one of the strongest supporters of [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick Barnewall]] in his protest against the fines imposed for failure to attend [[Anglican]] service and the use of the [[Court of Castle Chamber]] to impose religious conformity. Yet again he was arrested but, probably because of his age,  he was not imprisoned.<ref>Kenny, Colum ''The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland'' Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.66</ref>\n\n==''Digby v Earl of Kildare''==\nIn his last years his  professional reputation  suffered  greatly from the reopening of the Kildare inheritance dispute which  had begun 20 years earlier. [[Lettice Digby, 1st Baroness Offaly]] was the granddaughter and heir general of Burnell's old client the 11th Earl of Kildare and his wife [[Mabel Browne]]. Lettice and her husband deeply resented the fact that the great bulk of the Kildare inheritance had passed first to her uncle and then to her cousin [[Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Kildare]]. By 1602 she had learned that a crucial [[deed]] supposedly executed by her grandfather, who died in 1585, might have been forged or tampered with by his widow. She and her husband [[Robert Digby (courtier)|Sir Robert Digby]] then sued both the  present Earl and the aged Dowager Countess. The case went on for over a decade and involved numerous hearings in several different courts.<ref>Crawford, p.493</ref>\n\nIn 1608 the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], the  Irish equivalent of [[Star Chamber]],  began an inquiry into the [[forgery]] allegation, which transformed a private lawsuit into a matter concerning the Crown.<ref>Something the Court came to regret, since the case was so complex that for two law terms it was unable to deal with any other business: Crawford pp.293-5</ref> The old Countess admitted that she had consulted Burnell in 1585 about the deed, fearing that it did not  adequately protect her [[jointure]], and that Burnell had advised that it did not give adequate protection but that he would make the necessary alterations.<ref>Crawford pp.494\u20135</ref> Burnell himself admitted to having advised on making some alterations \"but without offence\" (presumably he meant without criminal intent). The Chamber acquitted the Countess of any crime, but found Burnell guilty of [[forgery]], a \"grave offence deserving severe punishment\". He was subjected to a heavy fine and to be imprisoned at the Crown's pleasure, although it does not seem the latter penalty was carried out.<ref>Crawford p.496</ref>\n\nJon Crawford  in his detailed analysis  of the trial cautions against placing too much reliance on evidence from witnesses who were describing the events of more than 20 years past.<ref>Crawford p.151</ref> Nonetheless Burnell did admit to having advised that the deed could be altered.  Such behaviour from an eminent lawyer, whom even his critics admitted  an honest man, seems extraordinary, but the Kildares were his most important clients and he may have wished to retain the Countess' business by obliging her in the matter of the deed.\n\n==Family==\nBurnell married into the O'Reilly family of [[Cavan]]; his wife died in 1605. Of their children only one  son Christopher reached adulthood. Christopher was the father of [[Henry Burnell (author)|Henry Burnell the younger]], who was a leader of the [[Irish Confederacy]] and a well-known author, best remembered for his play ''Landgartha''.<ref name=\"Ball_a\">Ball p.224</ref>\n\n==Death and reputation==\nBurnell died at Castleknock in 1614. He was remembered as one of the best orators and most eminent lawyers of his time. He was somewhat vain about  his  legal  ability, and  was said to boast of his power to  invariably persuade  judges to find in his favour.<ref name=\"Ball_a\" /> Despite the Kildare scandal, he was generally considered  to be an honest man, as even Sir Henry Sidney,  one of his sternest  critics, admitted.<ref name=\"Bagwell p.329\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Burnell, Henry}}\n[[Category:1540s births]]\n[[Category:1614 deaths]]\n[[Category:Politicians from County Dublin]]\n[[Category:Year of birth uncertain]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n[[Category:Irish MPs 1585\u20131586]]\n[[Category:Recorders of Dublin]]\n[[Category:Members of the Parliament of Ireland (pre-1801) for County Dublin constituencies]]\n", "name_user": "Chrisdoyleorwell", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEarly life", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Burnell"}

The RRP has since been reestablished in 3rd [[Radio Battalion]], Kaneohe HI.

Gray]] -->\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Lt. General Alfred M. Gray, Jr.]], Commanding General of [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic]] (FMFLant) and future [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], and Lt. Col. Bill Keller, Commanding Officer of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]], [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic|FMFLant]], met at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]] in the spring of 1984 to welcome home the returning members of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment from [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. The [[Marines]] of 2nd[[Radio Battalion]] had conducted tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] operations in support of the entire deployment of the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|US peacekeeping force]] in [[Beirut]] since the initial landings at [[Beirut International Airport]].\n\nDuring the wait, [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Gray]] and Keller were discussing the various problems faced by the [[Radio Battalion]] detachment. Both agreed that the most significant problem was the lack of a tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] database available from national and theater assets prior to the [[Marines]]' landing in [[Beirut]]. Equally significant were the unconventional aspects of the communications networks used by the various factions in [[Beirut]]. Those that posed the greatest threat to the [[Marines]] did not abide by standard military communications procedures, nor did they follow set frequencies or [[call sign]]s.\n\nBecause the detachment had received no intelligence from the [[National Security Agency]] prior to deployment, they were forced to start from scratch upon arrival in [[Beirut]]. [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] wanted to integrate a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Reconnaissance]] team with attached [[Radio Battalion]] [[Cryptology|cryptologists]], selected and trained for [[terrestrial reconnaissance]] and special operations. He directed Lt. Col. Keller to coordinate with [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] to test this idea.\n\nKeller coordinated with the Commanding Officer of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]], Maj. Joe Crockett. Their initial step was to attach a [[Radio Battalion]] Marine, equipped with an AN/GRR-8 receiver to a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] Team during an exercise and see if he could keep up and do something worthwhile. The experiment did not go well, and the concept was tabled until that summer, when Lieutenant Colonel Chuck Gallina became Commanding Officer (CO) of 2nd [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn.]] [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] discussed the idea with Gallina, who became a major proponent of the concept.\n\nIn December 1984, [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] E.L. Gillespie, a J2 SIGINT Operations Officer in [[Joint Special Operations Command]], arrived at [[Radio Battalion]] to develop a concept of operations to integrate [[Radio Battalion]] Marines with [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] teams for independent advance force operations.\n\nCaptain Gillespie submitted a draft \"Talking Paper\" contending that integration with a four-man [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] team was not viable due to conflicting missions. He suggested that a separate six-man [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn]] team be trained in selected airborne and seaborne insertion/extraction techniques, terrestrial reconnaissance and survival skills.\n\nThe original mission statement for the team was, \"To conduct limited [[communications intelligence]] and specified [[electronic warfare]] operations in support of Force Reconnaissance operations during advance force or special operations missions.''\n\nThe initial list of titles for this proposed group was:\n* Force Reconnaissance Support Team (FRST)\n* Radio Search Team (RST)\n* Signal Search Team (SST)\n* Special Search Team (SST)\n* Radio Research Team (RRT)\n* Radio Reconnaissance Team (RRT)\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] got the list and personally circled the Radio Reconnaissance Team as the official name for the teams. He then directed the CO of [[Radio Battalion]] to screen, select, and train the required personnel to deploy two six-man RRT's for a [[proof of concept]] operational deployment during the advance force operational phase of Exercise Solid Shield-85.\n\nHe also ensured that the CO of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] would assist in the personnel selection, training and equipping, and that [[II Marine Expeditionary Force|II MEF's]] Solid Shield-85 OPLANS, OPORDERS, and Annexes would adequately reflect the integration of the RRT.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was directed to immediately commence screening of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] personnel. However, most [[Radio Battalion]] Marines did not share the officers' enthusiasm for the project. There was also resistance by Company Commanders, who did not want to allow their best Marines to be assigned to the task. With the exception of the [[Non-commissioned officer|Senior non-commissioned officers]] and [[Sergeants]], the majority of the Marines provided to form the initial RRT's were \"malcontents\" waiting to be [[Military discharge|discharged]].\n\nAt this time, Major Carrick insisted that all of the RRT candidates must go through the 2nd [[Force Reconnaissance]] Company [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoctrination Process (Indoc)]]. Carrick later admitted that the only reason that he insisted on this issue was that he felt that all or most of the [[Radio Battalion]] Marines would either quit or fail the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] and the project would be put to rest once and for all.\n\nHowever, all of the RRT candidates passed the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]]. Captain Gillespie later talked to the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] instructors, who indicated that they had done everything that they could think of to make the RRT Marines quit, but they wouldn't.\n\nAfter the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]], one RRT was sent to [[United States Army Airborne School|Army Airborne School]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], while the other Marines prepared and trained for Solid Shield-85. The exercise went well, and by all accounts, the [[Radio Reconnaissance]] [[proof of concept]] was an unqualified success.\n\nIn 1987, [[Radio Battalion#1st Radio Battalion|1st Radio Battalion]] at [[Marine Corps Base Hawaii|MCB Hawaii]] officially created a Radio Reconnaissance Platoon. Prior to 1987, the [[battalion]] had shied away from designating the unit as \"Radio Reconnaissance\" for fear of dividing vital resources and creating a separatist culture within the ranks of MEU(SOC) deploying [[Radio Battalion]] detachments. 1st RRP Marines trained with Alpha Company, [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] in the initial stages and attended various multi-service schools to perfect their skills. During its first two years, 1st [[Radio Battalion's]] RRIP consisted of 4\u20136 months of training, formal schools, and exercises prior to a Marine achieving certification and being assigned to a team.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1989, RRT's were deployed as an element of the [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]] ([[Special Operations Capable]]) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment assigned to each of the rotating [[11th Marine Expeditionary Unit|11th]], [[13th Marine Expeditionary Unit|13th]], [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit|15th]], [[22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit|22nd]], [[24th Marine Expeditionary Unit|24th]], and [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit|26th MEU(SOC)]] deployments.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was assigned as the officer in charge of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment, 24th MEU(SOC) in 1986, which was the first [[Radio Battalion]] detachment to conduct real world operations during [[Operation Earnest Will]] (a [[Kuwait]]i [[oil tanker]] escort operation). The 24th MEU(SOC) RRT reinforced by members of 1st RRP with specific linguist skills, was involved in significant cryptologic operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] and provided intelligence support for several [[Iran\u2013Iraq War#The Tanker War and U.S. support for Iraq|combat actions against]] [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy|Iranian forces]], including the seizure of the Iranian mine-laying vessel, [[Iran Ajr]] and the [[Operation Prime Chance|incident at Middle Shoals Light]]. Other RRT personnel were involved in actions in [[Panama]] leading to and during [[Operation Just Cause]], the invasion of [[Panama]].\n\nIn the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Theater, the first certified RRT to participate in real-world operations deployed in 1988\u201389 as part of the 13th MEU(SOC) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment commanded by [[First Lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|First Lieutenant]] Kirk Kicklighter. [[Staff Sergeant]] Scott Laasanen and Sergeant Daniel Stinson served as team leaders during collection missions in support of [[Australian Defence Force|Australian forces]] intervening in [[civil war]] in [[Papua New Guinea]], as well as intelligence operations against rebel forces seeking to [[1989 Philippine coup attempt|overthrow]] the newly installed government of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] in the Republic of the [[Philippines]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Radio Battalion]]\n* [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance]]\n* [[Alfred M.

The RRIP culminates in a series of [[field training exercise]]s (FTX's) from 72\u201396 hours in length.\n\n===Advanced training===\nAdvanced training may include:\n* [[US Army]] [[Ranger School]]\n* [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Mountain Warfare Training Center|Mountain Survival Course]]\n* [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] [[Mountain Leader]] Course\n* [[US Army]] [[Jumpmaster#United States|Jumpmaster]] Course\n* [[US Army]] [[United States Army Reconnaissance and Surveillance Leaders Course|Reconnaissance & Surveillance Leaders Course]] ([[RSLC]])\n* [[United States Army Pathfinder School|US Army Pathfinder School]]\n* Helicopter Rope Suspension Training (HRST) Masters Course\n* [[Coxswain]] Course\n* Maritime Navigator Course\n\n==Organization==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2012}}\nThere are currently three [[Radio Battalion]]s, two with their own RRPs. 1st [[Radio Battalion]], [[I Marine Expeditionary Force]] (MEF), is located at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]], [[California]]. 2nd [[Radio Battalion]], [[II Marine Expeditionary Force]], is located at [[Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune|Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]].\n\nOwing to a restructuring of the entire [[Radio Battalion]] organization, the former 1st [[Radio Battalion]], with its RRP, moved from [[Marine Corps Base Hawaii]] in [[K\u0101ne'ohe Bay|K\u0101ne{{okina}}ohe Bay]] to [[Camp Pendleton]] in October 2004. The RRP has since been reestablished in 3rd [[Radio Battalion]], Kaneohe HI. The RRTs of 1st and 3rd [[Radio Battalion]]s still deploy in support of [[III Marine Expeditionary Force|III MEF's]] [[31st Marine Expeditionary Unit]] Alpha and Bravo cycles based in [[Marine Corps Base Camp Smedley D. Butler|Okinawa]]. 1st [[Radio Battalion]] also deploys RRT's in support of I MEF's rotating [[11th Marine Expeditionary Unit|11th]], [[13th Marine Expeditionary Unit|13th]] and [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]]s.\n\nA six-man RRP is typically composed of a Team Leader ([[Staff Sergeant#United States|Staff Sergeant]] or [[Sergeant#Marine Corps|Sergeant]]), Assistant Team Leader (Sergeant or [[Corporal#United States Marine Corps|Corporal]]), [[Take point|Point Man]], [[Navigator]], [[Wireless telegraphy#Radiotelegraphy|Radio-Telegraph]] Operator (RTO), and Assistant RTO.\n\n==History==\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2012}}\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:029 Gray.jpg|right|thumb|General Alfred M. Gray]] -->\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Lt. General Alfred M. Gray, Jr.]], Commanding General of [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic]] (FMFLant) and future [[Commandant of the Marine Corps]], and Lt. Col. Bill Keller, Commanding Officer of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]], [[Fleet Marine Force, Atlantic|FMFLant]], met at [[Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point]] in the spring of 1984 to welcome home the returning members of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment from [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]. The [[Marines]] of 2nd[[Radio Battalion]] had conducted tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] operations in support of the entire deployment of the [[Multinational Force in Lebanon|US peacekeeping force]] in [[Beirut]] since the initial landings at [[Beirut International Airport]].\n\nDuring the wait, [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|Gray]] and Keller were discussing the various problems faced by the [[Radio Battalion]] detachment. Both agreed that the most significant problem was the lack of a tactical [[Cryptology|cryptologic]] database available from national and theater assets prior to the [[Marines]]' landing in [[Beirut]]. Equally significant were the unconventional aspects of the communications networks used by the various factions in [[Beirut]]. Those that posed the greatest threat to the [[Marines]] did not abide by standard military communications procedures, nor did they follow set frequencies or [[call sign]]s.\n\nBecause the detachment had received no intelligence from the [[National Security Agency]] prior to deployment, they were forced to start from scratch upon arrival in [[Beirut]]. [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] wanted to integrate a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Reconnaissance]] team with attached [[Radio Battalion]] [[Cryptology|cryptologists]], selected and trained for [[terrestrial reconnaissance]] and special operations. He directed Lt. Col. Keller to coordinate with [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] to test this idea.\n\nKeller coordinated with the Commanding Officer of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]], Maj. Joe Crockett. Their initial step was to attach a [[Radio Battalion]] Marine, equipped with an AN/GRR-8 receiver to a [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] Team during an exercise and see if he could keep up and do something worthwhile. The experiment did not go well, and the concept was tabled until that summer, when Lieutenant Colonel Chuck Gallina became Commanding Officer (CO) of 2nd [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn.]] [[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] discussed the idea with Gallina, who became a major proponent of the concept.\n\nIn December 1984, [[Captain (United States)|Captain]] E.L. Gillespie, a J2 SIGINT Operations Officer in [[Joint Special Operations Command]], arrived at [[Radio Battalion]] to develop a concept of operations to integrate [[Radio Battalion]] Marines with [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] teams for independent advance force operations.\n\nCaptain Gillespie submitted a draft \"Talking Paper\" contending that integration with a four-man [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance|Force Recon]] team was not viable due to conflicting missions. He suggested that a separate six-man [[Radio Battalion|Radio Bn]] team be trained in selected airborne and seaborne insertion/extraction techniques, terrestrial reconnaissance and survival skills.\n\nThe original mission statement for the team was, \"To conduct limited [[communications intelligence]] and specified [[electronic warfare]] operations in support of Force Reconnaissance operations during advance force or special operations missions.''\n\nThe initial list of titles for this proposed group was:\n* Force Reconnaissance Support Team (FRST)\n* Radio Search Team (RST)\n* Signal Search Team (SST)\n* Special Search Team (SST)\n* Radio Research Team (RRT)\n* Radio Reconnaissance Team (RRT)\n[[Alfred M. Gray, Jr.|General Gray]] got the list and personally circled the Radio Reconnaissance Team as the official name for the teams. He then directed the CO of [[Radio Battalion]] to screen, select, and train the required personnel to deploy two six-man RRT's for a [[proof of concept]] operational deployment during the advance force operational phase of Exercise Solid Shield-85.\n\nHe also ensured that the CO of [[2nd Force Reconnaissance Company]] would assist in the personnel selection, training and equipping, and that [[II Marine Expeditionary Force|II MEF's]] Solid Shield-85 OPLANS, OPORDERS, and Annexes would adequately reflect the integration of the RRT.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was directed to immediately commence screening of 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] personnel. However, most [[Radio Battalion]] Marines did not share the officers' enthusiasm for the project. There was also resistance by Company Commanders, who did not want to allow their best Marines to be assigned to the task. With the exception of the [[Non-commissioned officer|Senior non-commissioned officers]] and [[Sergeants]], the majority of the Marines provided to form the initial RRT's were \"malcontents\" waiting to be [[Military discharge|discharged]].\n\nAt this time, Major Carrick insisted that all of the RRT candidates must go through the 2nd [[Force Reconnaissance]] Company [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoctrination Process (Indoc)]]. Carrick later admitted that the only reason that he insisted on this issue was that he felt that all or most of the [[Radio Battalion]] Marines would either quit or fail the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] and the project would be put to rest once and for all.\n\nHowever, all of the RRT candidates passed the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]]. Captain Gillespie later talked to the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]] instructors, who indicated that they had done everything that they could think of to make the RRT Marines quit, but they wouldn't.\n\nAfter the [[United States Marine Air-Ground Task Force Reconnaissance#Indoctrination|Indoc]], one RRT was sent to [[United States Army Airborne School|Army Airborne School]] at [[Fort Benning]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], while the other Marines prepared and trained for Solid Shield-85. The exercise went well, and by all accounts, the [[Radio Reconnaissance]] [[proof of concept]] was an unqualified success.\n\nIn 1987, [[Radio Battalion#1st Radio Battalion|1st Radio Battalion]] at [[Marine Corps Base Hawaii|MCB Hawaii]] officially created a Radio Reconnaissance Platoon. Prior to 1987, the [[battalion]] had shied away from designating the unit as \"Radio Reconnaissance\" for fear of dividing vital resources and creating a separatist culture within the ranks of MEU(SOC) deploying [[Radio Battalion]] detachments. 1st RRP Marines trained with Alpha Company, [[3rd Reconnaissance Battalion]] in the initial stages and attended various multi-service schools to perfect their skills. During its first two years, 1st [[Radio Battalion's]] RRIP consisted of 4\u20136 months of training, formal schools, and exercises prior to a Marine achieving certification and being assigned to a team.\n\nBetween 1986 and 1989, RRT's were deployed as an element of the [[Marine Expeditionary Unit]] ([[Special Operations Capable]]) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment assigned to each of the rotating [[11th Marine Expeditionary Unit|11th]], [[13th Marine Expeditionary Unit|13th]], [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit|15th]], [[22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit|22nd]], [[24th Marine Expeditionary Unit|24th]], and [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit|26th MEU(SOC)]] deployments.\n\nCaptain Gillespie was assigned as the officer in charge of the 2nd [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment, 24th MEU(SOC) in 1986, which was the first [[Radio Battalion]] detachment to conduct real world operations during [[Operation Earnest Will]] (a [[Kuwait]]i [[oil tanker]] escort operation). The 24th MEU(SOC) RRT reinforced by members of 1st RRP with specific linguist skills, was involved in significant cryptologic operations in the [[Persian Gulf]] and provided intelligence support for several [[Iran\u2013Iraq War#The Tanker War and U.S. support for Iraq|combat actions against]] [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy|Iranian forces]], including the seizure of the Iranian mine-laying vessel, [[Iran Ajr]] and the [[Operation Prime Chance|incident at Middle Shoals Light]]. Other RRT personnel were involved in actions in [[Panama]] leading to and during [[Operation Just Cause]], the invasion of [[Panama]].\n\nIn the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] Theater, the first certified RRT to participate in real-world operations deployed in 1988\u201389 as part of the 13th MEU(SOC) [[Radio Battalion]] Detachment commanded by [[First Lieutenant#U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Air Force|First Lieutenant]] Kirk Kicklighter. [[Staff Sergeant]] Scott Laasanen and Sergeant Daniel Stinson served as team leaders during collection missions in support of [[Australian Defence Force|Australian forces]] intervening in [[civil war]] in [[Papua New Guinea]], as well as intelligence operations against rebel forces seeking to [[1989 Philippine coup attempt|overthrow]] the newly installed government of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] in the Republic of the [[Philippines]].\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Radio Battalion]]\n* [[United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance]]\n* [[Alfred M.

Its diet consists of insects.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n* Jean Delacour, 'The Lesser Graybirds (''Coracina'') of Asia and Malaysia', ''American Museum Novitates'', 3 April 1951\n* ''ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity'' website: [http://aseanbiodiversity.org/cgi-bin/abiss.exe/spd?SID=576718806&spd=5910&tx=AV&iso3=THA]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}  Downloaded on 11 October 2007.\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q3233186}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:cuckooshrike, lesser}}\n[[Category:Lalage (bird)|lesser cuckooshrike]]\n[[Category:Birds of Malesia]]\n[[Category:Birds described in 1824|lesser cuckooshrike]]\n[[Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot]]\n\n{{Campephagidae-stub}}\n", "name_user": "WolfmanSF", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesser_cuckooshrike"}
