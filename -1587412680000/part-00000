South Africa: DeafSA.</ref> does not give an accurate depiction of the number of people who communicate in South African Sign Language. \nThere is currently no estimate for the number of people who communicate in South African Sign Language in South Africa. Estimates vary greatly, from 700,000 to 2 million users.<ref name=\"SASLguestimate\"/> A request was made to the [[Human Sciences Research Council (South Africa)]] to measure this as part of the 2011 census.{{update inline|date=December 2013}}\n\n== Linguistic features ==\n{{Expert needed|Deaf|section|reason=the section contains practically nothing about the linguistics of SASL|date=May 2013}}\n\n=== Fingerspelling ===\n\n[[File:SASL-Fingerspelled-Alphabet.png|thumb|240px|right|South African Sign Language one-handed manual alphabet for fingerspelling]]\nFingerspelling is a manual technique of signing used to spell letters and numbers (numerals, cardinals). Therefore, fingerspelling is a sign language technique for ''borrowing'' words from spoken languages, as well as for spelling names of people, places and objects. It is a practical tool to refer to the written word.\n\nSome words which are often fingerspelled tend to become signs in their own right (becoming \"frozen\"), following linguistic transformation processes such as alphanumeric incorporation and abbreviation. For instance, one of the sign-names for [[Cape Town]] uses incorporated fingerspelled letters ''C.T.'' ( transition from handshape for letter 'C' to letter 'T' of both wrists with rotation on an horizontal axis). The month of July is often abbreviated as 'J-L-Y'.\n\nFingerspelling words is not a substitute for using existing signs: it takes longer to sign and it is harder to perceive. If the fingerspelled word is a borrowing, fingerspelling depends on both users having knowledge of the oral language (English, Sotho, Afrikaans etc.).  \nAlthough [[proper names]] (such as a person's name, a company name) are often fingerspelled, it is often a temporary measure until the Deaf community agrees on a [[Sign name]] replacement.\n\n=== Sign-names and Idioms ===\n\n[[Sign name]]s are specific signs which are associated with proper names (a location, a person, an organisation). Sign names are often chosen based on a salient physical property. For instance, the sign name for [[Nelson Mandela]] is signed using a flat B-hand that ''follows a hair-line over the head''. The sign name for the bank [[Absa Group Limited|ABSA]] is made with both hands following the movement implied in the company corporate logo.\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nSouth Africa is one of a few countries to have legal recognition of sign language.<ref>(1987). A Loss for Words: The Story of Deafness in a Family. New York: HarperPerennial. p. 31. {{ISBN|0-06-091425-4}}.</ref>  There is presumably some regional variation, but signers from across the country can readily understand each other, as demonstrated for example at the annual [[Deaf Forum]].\n\nIt is commonly believed among South Africans, even among Deaf South Africans, that different language communities have different sign languages.  This is evidently the result of the Deaf not being able to understand sign-language interpreters from other communities.  However, this is because such \"interpreters\" do not actually use sign language, but rather Signed English, Signed Xhosa, etc., and only those who have been schooled in these artificial codes can understand them.

Therefore, fingerspelling is a sign language technique for ''borrowing'' words from spoken languages, as well as for spelling names of people, places and objects. It is a practical tool to refer to the written word.\n\nSome words which are often fingerspelled tend to become signs in their own right (becoming \"frozen\"), following linguistic transformation processes such as alphanumeric incorporation and abbreviation. For instance, one of the sign-names for [[Cape Town]] uses incorporated fingerspelled letters ''C.T.'' ( transition from handshape for letter 'C' to letter 'T' of both wrists with rotation on an horizontal axis). The month of July is often abbreviated as 'J-L-Y'.\n\nFingerspelling words is not a substitute for using existing signs: it takes longer to sign and it is harder to perceive. If the fingerspelled word is a borrowing, fingerspelling depends on both users having knowledge of the oral language (English, Sotho, Afrikaans etc.).  \nAlthough [[proper names]] (such as a person's name, a company name) are often fingerspelled, it is often a temporary measure until the Deaf community agrees on a [[Sign name]] replacement.\n\n=== Sign-names and Idioms ===\n\n[[Sign name]]s are specific signs which are associated with proper names (a location, a person, an organisation). Sign names are often chosen based on a salient physical property. For instance, the sign name for [[Nelson Mandela]] is signed using a flat B-hand that ''follows a hair-line over the head''. The sign name for the bank [[Absa Group Limited|ABSA]] is made with both hands following the movement implied in the company corporate logo.\n\n=== Variation ===\n\nSouth Africa is one of a few countries to have legal recognition of sign language.<ref>(1987). A Loss for Words: The Story of Deafness in a Family. New York: HarperPerennial. p. 31. {{ISBN|0-06-091425-4}}.</ref>  There is presumably some regional variation, but signers from across the country can readily understand each other, as demonstrated for example at the annual [[Deaf Forum]].\n\nIt is commonly believed among South Africans, even among Deaf South Africans, that different language communities have different sign languages.  This is evidently the result of the Deaf not being able to understand sign-language interpreters from other communities.  However, this is because such \"interpreters\" do not actually use sign language, but rather Signed English, Signed Xhosa, etc., and only those who have been schooled in these artificial codes can understand them.

The show's success that year was due to Williams' public support for Senate Bill 1898, the Postal Salary Readjustment Bill.

Early in her career, she told reporters that she tested new burlesque bits on her sisters.<ref name=\"Brooklyn Daily Eagle\"/> Later, Williams admitted that she would listen closely to women in the audience and rewrite scenes until they laughed.<ref>{{cite news |title=Says Women Are Best Judge of Plays |work=Dayton Daily News |date=October 24, 1926 |pages=21}}</ref> As a producer, Williams honed her image as a sympathetic boss, casting herself as a friend to the chorus girls because she had once been one herself.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mollie Ever Was a Merry-Merry Herself, So Girls All Like Her |work=Omaha Sunday Bee |date=November 7, 1920 |pages=5-D}}</ref>\n\nThe Mollie Williams Show was a major financial success for the [[Columbia Wheel]]. Williams\u2019 box office returns were second only to Jean Bedini, Columbia's top-performing male producer and performer.<ref name=\"American Burlesque\" />\n\n==Postal Salary Readjustment Bill==\nThe 1923\u20131924 season of The Mollie Williams Show smashed house records for ticket sales in major cities along the Columbia Wheel route. The show's success that year was due to Williams' public support for Senate Bill 1898, the Postal Salary Readjustment Bill. On the advice of the assistant superintendent of the Brooklyn Post Office, Williams used her popular letter carrier dance number to champion improved wages for postal workers. She went so far as to meet in Washington with the bill's sponsor, Pennsylvania Congressman [[Melville Clyde Kelly]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Mollie Does Bit to Aid Mail Force |work=Dayton Daily News |date=March 6, 1924}}</ref>\n\nPostal workers in numerous cities organized parades and parties in Williams\u2019 honor. They bought tickets to The Mollie Williams Show for themselves and their families.<ref>{{cite news |title=Postal Workers Here to Honor Mollie Williams |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |date=December 16, 1924}}</ref> They \"made it their business to mention that they had seen Miss Williams' show when delivering letters to households and that the show was a good one.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Mollie Williams Tieup with Letter Carriers |work=Variety |date=February 28, 1924 |pages=1 and 27}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1901, Williams married Albert Thomas Thetford, an insurance agent from Brooklyn.<ref>{{cite web |title=New York, New York, Extracted Marriage Index, 1866-1937 |url=https://search.ancestry.com/ |website=Ancestry.com}}</ref> Two years later they had a son, Edwin Thetford, who was Williams\u2019 only child. Edwin attended the [[New York Institution for the Instruction of the Deaf and Dumb]]. He died in 1941.<ref>{{cite web |title=New York, State Census, 1915 |url=https://search.ancestry.com |website=Ancestry.com}}</ref> In 1946, Williams married Hugh Dewart, President of Mohican Stores, Inc.<ref>{{cite web |title=New York, New York, Marriage License Indexes, 1907-2018 |url=https://search.ancestry.com/ |website=Ancestry.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Hugh Dewart, 73, Stores' Executive |work=New York Times |date=March 14, 1949 |pages=19}}</ref>\n\nThroughout her life, Williams dedicated herself to causes. In 1914, she turned down a leading role in Maurice Jacob's The Cherry Blossoms when the two failed to agree on a fair salary. ''Variety'' reported, \u201cMiss Williams\u2019 insistence upon a certain figure for her services has caused her to reject many offers that would have been decidedly alluring to almost any principal woman in burlesque.\u201d<ref>{{cite news |title=Mollie\u2019s Engagement Off |work=Variety |date=December 21, 1914}}</ref> During that same year, she sued a motion picture company for royalties after they staged and filmed a traffic stop to catch her off guard.<ref>{{cite news |title=Made Movie Star Against Her Will |work=Washington Times |date=January 17, 1914}}</ref> As a producer, Williams staged overtly political material. For example, Williams' Wilson Show campaigned for the reelection of Woodrow Wilson during the [[1916 United States presidential election|Presidential Election of 1916]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Columbia Has Wilson Show |work=New-York Tribune |date=October 17, 1916 |pages=7}}</ref> Williams was an active member of the [[Actors Fund of America]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Burlesque Booth at Fair |work=Variety |date=April 9, 1910}}</ref>\n\nMollie Williams died in New York on January 5, 1954.<ref name=\"Burlesque Bits\"/> After a funeral service in University Chapel, she was buried next to her son, Edwin Thetford, at the Linden Hill Jewish Cemetery in Ridgewood, New York.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mollie Thetford |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/126046168 |website=Find a Grave}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Commons-inline}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47df-6a0b-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99 |title=Mollie Williams |author=Digital Collections, The New York Public Library |accessdate=February 26, 2019 |publisher=The New York Public Library, Astor, Lennox, and Tilden Foundation}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/8da1dd72-4d1e-c812-e040-e00a18063808 |title=Mollie Williams, photographs |author=Digital Collections, The New York Public Library |accessdate=February 25, 2019 |publisher=The New York Public Library, Astor, Lennox, and Tilden Foundation}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47df-6a0c-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99 |title=Mollie Williams |author=Digital Collections, The New York Public Library |accessdate=February 25, 2019 |publisher=The New York Public Library, Astor, Lennox, and Tilden Foundation}}\n*{{cite web |url=https://dspace.sunyconnect.suny.edu/handle/1951/66459 |title=(sheet music) I Know You.
