The border between India and Sri Lanka is said to pass across one of the shoals, constituting one of the shortest land borders in the world.

He fired hundreds of golden arrows which became serpents that cut off Ravana's heads, but ultimately had to use the divine arrow of Brahma (which had the power of the gods in it and cannot miss its target) to slay Ravana.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/learning/cult/inside/gallery/ravanadeath/ravanaheads.html |title=Ravana loses his heads |publisher=British Library |accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref><ref name=Hakai>{{cite web |url=https://www.hakaimagazine.com/news/god-or-geology-genesis-rams-bridge/ |title=God or Geology?

Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|first team]] set a school record for wins that would stand for 41 years and his [[1928 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|last team]] claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In [[1930 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1930]], James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in [[1932 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1932]] seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the [[1937 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1937]] season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By [[1952 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1952]], with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship, tied the [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins, and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In [[1963 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1963]], Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131 and set a new [[1952 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins. Denes retired after the [[1967 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1967]] season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between [[1970 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1970]] and [[1980 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1980]]. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn [[1973 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1973]], the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131, setting a new [[1963 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins that still stands. In [[1975 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1975]], the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, [[1978 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1978]] and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In [[1987 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1987]] and [[1988 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1988]] Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC [[2000 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|2000]], Gateway [[2002 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|2002]]) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in [[1993 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1993]] before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit. John, on the other hand, was a coach at [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] and could rely on his scouting services, deep contacts, and endless high school game footage to help out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/nfl--harbaugh-sons-used-unconventional-means-to-help-father-build-college-football-powerhouse-053413373.html|title=Harbaugh sons used unconventional means to help father build college football powerhouse|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Jim set out and started contacting recruits, his first being [[Willie Taggart]], an All-American and four-year starter at quarterback for WKU. Jim also recruited future NFL players [[Rod Smart]] and [[Mel Mitchell]] to WKU as well as 17 players on the 2002 national championship team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/49ers/article/How-Jim-Harbaugh-saved-dad-s-program-4230790.php|title=How Jim Harbaugh saved dad's program|newspaper=SFGate|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nThe Hilltoppers went 7-4 in 1996 and returned to the [[1997 NCAA Division I-AA football season|NCAA Playoffs]] in [[1997 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1997]] behind the arm and legs of quarterback Willie Taggart, which started a long series of winning seasons. Jack and his wife Jackie are credited with saving the program which led to being honored in 2012 with naming rights to the stadium club at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium|L. T.

Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2007 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|2007]], the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up?

The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]].

From there, Taggart is credited with getting WKU's football program back on track after posting back to back 7\u20135 regular seasons that included an upset of [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] in Lexington in 2012. That was Western Kentucky's first win over a [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] opponent in program history. Despite the surprising 7\u20135 record in [[2011 WKU Hilltoppers football team|2011]], a season in which the Hilltoppers went 7\u20131 in their final eight games, they were not invited to a bowl game.

Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|first team]] set a school record for wins that would stand for 41 years and his [[1928 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|last team]] claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In [[1930 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1930]], James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in [[1932 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1932]] seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the [[1937 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1937]] season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By [[1952 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1952]], with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship, tied the [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins, and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In [[1963 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1963]], Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131 and set a new [[1952 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins. Denes retired after the [[1967 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1967]] season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between [[1970 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1970]] and [[1980 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1980]]. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn [[1973 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1973]], the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131, setting a new [[1963 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins that still stands. In [[1975 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1975]], the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, [[1978 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1978]] and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In [[1987 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1987]] and [[1988 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1988]] Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC [[2000 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|2000]], Gateway [[2002 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|2002]]) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in [[1993 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1993]] before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit.

Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn [[2007 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|2007]], the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up?

The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]].

The record contains lyrics about such issues as domestic violence and racism. The band opted to continue their collaboration with Swedish music producer [[Martin Terefe]]\u2014who worked with them on their previous album ''[[Wake Up Call (Theory of a Deadman album)|Wake Up Call]]''\u2014returning to [[London]] in April 2019. Their prior album marked the group's departure from their usual hard rock sound to a more pop- and pop rock-infused style and was met with mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Background and development==\n[[Theory of a Deadman]]'s sound had been firmly rooted in the [[Alternative rock|alternative]] and [[hard rock]] genres since the band signed a record deal with [[Chad Kroeger]]'s [[604 Records]] in 2001. Lead singer Tyler Connolly stated that after the release of their fourth studio album, ''[[The Truth Is... (Theory of a Deadman album)|The Truth Is...]]'', in 2011, the band was receiving pressure from their record label to create an album that was \"more poppy\". He believed the label was \"getting tired of [their] fun rock stuff\" and \"wanted to hear something different\". The band responded to this pressure with the release of their fifth studio album, ''[[Savages (Theory of a Deadman album)|Savages]]'', in 2014, which Connolly described as the \"opposite\" of their record label's wishes.<ref name=\"NRR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalrockreview.com/interviews/tyler-connolly-of-theory-of-a-deadman|title=Tyler Connolly of Theory of a Deadman|last=Kennedy|first=Adam|date=March 6, 2016|publisher=[[National Rock Review]]|accessdate=September 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914033121/http://www.nationalrockreview.com/interviews/tyler-connolly-of-theory-of-a-deadman|archive-date=September 14, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Los Angeles-based music producer [[Howard Benson]] worked with the band on ''Savages'' as well as three of their previous albums,<ref name=\"SurreyNow-Leader\">{{cite web|url=https://www.surreynowleader.com/entertainment/rx-medicate-the-biggest-song-of-theory-of-a-deadmans-16-year-career-north-delta-bassist-raves/|title='Rx (Medicate)' the Biggest Song of Theory of a Deadman's 16-year Career, North Delta Bassist Raves|last=Zillich|first=Tom|website=[[The Now (newspaper)|Surrey Now-Leader]]|date=December 15, 2017|accessdate=September 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518173856/https://www.surreynowleader.com/entertainment/rx-medicate-the-biggest-song-of-theory-of-a-deadmans-16-year-career-north-delta-bassist-raves/|archive-date=May 18, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> but the group felt they wanted something different for their future records. Connolly stated that their [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] team mentioned Swedish music producer, [[Martin Terefe]], who was known for working with pop rock music artists such as [[Jason Mraz]], [[James Blunt]], and [[Train (band)|Train]], and was interested in collaborating with the group.

The record contains lyrics about such issues as domestic violence and racism. The band opted to continue their collaboration with Swedish music producer [[Martin Terefe]]\u2014who worked with them on their previous album ''[[Wake Up Call (Theory of a Deadman album)|Wake Up Call]]''\u2014returning to [[London]] in April 2019. Their prior album marked the group's departure from their usual hard rock sound to a more pop- and pop rock-infused style and was met with mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Background and development==\n[[Theory of a Deadman]]'s sound had been firmly rooted in the [[Alternative rock|alternative]] and [[hard rock]] genres since the band signed a record deal with [[Chad Kroeger]]'s [[604 Records]] in 2001. Lead singer Tyler Connolly stated that after the release of their fourth studio album, ''[[The Truth Is... (Theory of a Deadman album)|The Truth Is...]]'', in 2011, the band was receiving pressure from their record label to create an album that was \"more poppy\". He believed the label was \"getting tired of [their] fun rock stuff\" and \"wanted to hear something different\". The band responded to this pressure with the release of their fifth studio album, ''[[Savages (Theory of a Deadman album)|Savages]]'', in 2014, which Connolly described as the \"opposite\" of their record label's wishes.<ref name=\"NRR\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalrockreview.com/interviews/tyler-connolly-of-theory-of-a-deadman|title=Tyler Connolly of Theory of a Deadman|last=Kennedy|first=Adam|date=March 6, 2016|publisher=[[National Rock Review]]|accessdate=September 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914033121/http://www.nationalrockreview.com/interviews/tyler-connolly-of-theory-of-a-deadman|archive-date=September 14, 2017|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Los Angeles-based music producer [[Howard Benson]] worked with the band on ''Savages'' as well as three of their previous albums,<ref name=\"SurreyNow-Leader\">{{cite web|url=https://www.surreynowleader.com/entertainment/rx-medicate-the-biggest-song-of-theory-of-a-deadmans-16-year-career-north-delta-bassist-raves/|title='Rx (Medicate)' the Biggest Song of Theory of a Deadman's 16-year Career, North Delta Bassist Raves|last=Zillich|first=Tom|website=[[The Now (newspaper)|Surrey Now-Leader]]|date=December 15, 2017|accessdate=September 25, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518173856/https://www.surreynowleader.com/entertainment/rx-medicate-the-biggest-song-of-theory-of-a-deadmans-16-year-career-north-delta-bassist-raves/|archive-date=May 18, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> but the group felt they wanted something different for their future records. Connolly stated that their [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] team mentioned Swedish music producer, [[Martin Terefe]], who was known for working with pop rock music artists such as [[Jason Mraz]], [[James Blunt]], and [[Train (band)|Train]], and was interested in collaborating with the group.

Nickelodeon attractions currently exist at [[Movie Park Germany]], [[Pleasure Beach Blackpool]], [[Mall of America]] and [[Sea World (Australia)|Sea World]], as well as [[American Dream Meadowlands]]. Attractions previously existed at [[California's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland]], [[Carowinds]], [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]], [[Kings Dominion]], [[Kings Island]], [[Universal Studios Florida]], [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and [[WhiteWater World]].\n\n==History==\nOn June 7, 1990, [[Universal Studios Florida]] opened with an attraction named [[Nickelodeon Studios]]. It was a television taping studio for the [[Cable channel|cable television channel]] Nickelodeon.\n\nIn 1995, ''[[Nickelodeon Splat City]]'' opened at three former [[Paramount Parks]]: [[California's Great America]], [[Kings Dominion]] and [[Kings Island]]. These attractions were inspired by the game shows that aired on the television network and generally involved slime. In 1999, Kings Dominion closed Nickelodeon Splat City in preparation for the opening of its 2000 attraction, Nickelodeon Central. ''Nickelodeon Central'' brought a retheme of many of the park's children's rides as well as the addition of new ones. Kings Island followed suit, closing its Splat City in 2000 and opening ''Nickelodeon Central'' in 2001. This area would later be expanded and renamed ''Nickelodeon Universe'' in 2006.\n\nIn 2002, Australian theme park [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]] opened Nickelodeon Central.<ref name=\"Dreamworld History\">{{cite web|title=Dreamworld History|url=http://www.dreamworld.com.au/Schools/pdf/DW-Schools-History.pdf|publisher=Dreamworld|accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> In 2003, ''Nickelodeon Central'' opened at [[California's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland]] and [[Carowinds]], and [[Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast]] opened in Universal Studios Florida. Expansions of these areas took place in 2005, 2006 and 2008 for Carowinds, Kings Island and Dreamworld, respectively. The Kings Island area was also renamed to ''Nickelodeon Universe'' at the same time. In 2007, Movie Park Germany opened a similar area entitled ''Nickland''. In 2007, it was announced that ''Nickelodeon Universe'' would be opening in [[Mall of America]] in 2008, replacing ''[[Camp Snoopy]]''. In 2009 and 2010, Cedar Fair terminated their contract with Nickelodeon resulting in all of the areas being rethemed to ''Planet Snoopy''.

Nickelodeon attractions currently exist at [[Movie Park Germany]], [[Pleasure Beach Blackpool]], [[Mall of America]] and [[Sea World (Australia)|Sea World]], as well as [[American Dream Meadowlands]]. Attractions previously existed at [[California's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland]], [[Carowinds]], [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]], [[Kings Dominion]], [[Kings Island]], [[Universal Studios Florida]], [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] and [[WhiteWater World]].\n\n==History==\nOn 7 June 1990, [[Universal Studios Florida]] opened with an attraction named [[Nickelodeon Studios]]. It was a television taping studio for the [[Cable channel|cable television channel]], Nickelodeon. In 1995, ''[[Nickelodeon Splat City]]'' opened at three former [[Paramount Parks]]: [[California's Great America]], [[Kings Dominion]] and [[Kings Island]]. These attractions were inspired by many of the game shows on the television network and generally involved slime. In 1999, Kings Dominion closed Nickelodeon Splat City in preparation for its 2000 attraction, Nickelodeon Central. ''Nickelodeon Central'' saw the retheme of many of the park's children's rides as well as the addition of some new ones. Kings Island followed suit, closing their Splat City in 2000 and opening their ''Nickelodeon Central'' in 2001, which would later be expanded and renamed ''Nickelodeon Universe'' in 2006.\n\nIn 2002, Australian theme park [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]] opened Nickelodeon Central.<ref name=\"Dreamworld History\">{{cite web|title=Dreamworld History|url=http://www.dreamworld.com.au/Schools/pdf/DW-Schools-History.pdf|publisher=Dreamworld|accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> In 2003, ''Nickelodeon Central'' opened at [[California's Great America]], [[Canada's Wonderland]] and [[Carowinds]], and [[Jimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast]] opened in Universal Studios Florida. Expansions of these areas took place in 2005, 2006 and 2008 for Carowinds, Kings Island and Dreamworld, respectively. The Kings Island area was also renamed to ''Nickelodeon Universe'' at the same time. In 2007, Movie Park Germany opened a similar area entitled ''Nickland''. In 2007, it was announced that ''Nickelodeon Universe'' would be opening in [[Mall of America]] in 2008, replacing ''[[Camp Snoopy]]''. In 2009 and 2010, Cedar Fair terminated their contract with Nickelodeon resulting in all of the areas being rethemed to ''Planet Snoopy''. In early 2011, at a cost of {{Currency|10|GBP}} million, Pleasure Beach Blackpool opened ''Nickelodeon Land''.<ref name=\"PBB announcement\">{{cite news|last=Goodley|first=Simon|title=Nickelodeon signs Blackpool Pleasure Beach deal|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/jul/27/nickelodeon-blackpool-pleasure-beach-deal|accessdate=28 September 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|date=27 July 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"Official - Pleasure Beach Blackpool\">{{cite web|title=Nickelodeon Land|url=http://www.nickelodeonland.com/|publisher=Pleasure Beach Blackpool|accessdate=28 September 2010}}</ref> By mid-2011, [[Dreamworld (Australian theme park)|Dreamworld]] had closed their ''Nickelodeon Central'' and rethemed it to the generic [[Kid's World]] theme (it was later revealed that the park had struck a deal with [[DreamWorks Animation]]).<ref name=\"DW closure PR\" /><ref name=DreamWorks>{{cite web|title=Dreamworld Unveils Spectacular End of 2011: New World-Class Entertainment Alliance with DreamWorks Animation|url=http://about.dreamworld.com.au/Media-Centre/Press-Releases/Press-Release-Pages/DREAMWORLD-UNVEILS-SPECTACULAR-END-TO-2011.aspx|work=Press Release|publisher=Dreamworld|accessdate=19 November 2011|date=10 November 2011}}</ref> In 2012, [[Universal's Superstar Parade]] had its first performance which features floats based on ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' and ''[[Dora the Explorer]]'' and later opened a SpongeBob gift shop in Woody Woodpecker's Kidzone.

Section 27 of the Merchant Marine Act is known as '''the Jones Act ''' and deals with [[cabotage]] ([[coastwise trade]]) and requires that all goods transported by water between U.S. ports be carried on [[Flag state|U.S.-flag]] ships, constructed in the United States, owned by U.S. citizens, and crewed by U.S. citizens and U.S. permanent residents.<ref name=\"USC50101\">46.

The law also defines certain [[Sailor|seaman]]'s rights.\n\nLaws similar to the Jones Act date to the early days of the nation.

Originally a shipping term, cabotage now also covers aviation, railways, and road transport.  Cabotage is \"trade or navigation in coastal waters, or the exclusive right of a country to operate the air traffic within its territory\".<ref>\"Cabotage,\" definition, the Free Dictionary, available at http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Cabotage+trade.</ref> In the context of \"cabotage rights\", cabotage refers to the right of a company from one country to trade in another country. In aviation terms, for example, it is the right to operate within the domestic borders of another country. Most countries enact cabotage laws for reasons of economic [[protectionism]] or national security; 80% of the UN\u2019s member states with coastlines have cabotage law.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://seafarersrights.org/seafarers-subjects/cabotage/|title=Cabotage Laws of the World|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>((sources needed))\n\nThe cabotage provisions relating to the Jones Act restrict the [[Carriage of Goods|carriage of goods]] or passengers between United States ports to U.S.-built and flagged vessels. It has been codified as portions of [[Title 46 of the United States Code|46 U.S.C.]]&nbsp;<ref>46 U.S.C. \u00a755102 et seq.</ref> Generally, the Jones Act prohibits any foreign-built, foreign-owned or foreign-flagged vessel from engaging in coastwise trade within the United States. A number of other statutes affect coastwise trade and should be consulted along with the Jones Act. These include the [[Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886|Passenger Vessel Services Act]], {{USC|46|289}}, which restricts coastwise transportation of passengers, and {{USC|46|12108}}, which restricts the use of foreign vessels to commercially catch or transport fish in U.S. waters.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode46/usc_sup_01_46_06_V_08_D_10_551.html ch.551 Coastwise Trade] Cornell Law School</ref> These provisions also require at least three-fourths (75 percent) of the crew members to be U.S.&nbsp;citizens or permanent residents.

Its purpose is \"to further the development and maintenance of an adequate and well-balanced American merchant marine, to promote the commerce of the United States, to aid in the national defense, to repeal certain former legislation, and for other purposes.\"\n\nSpecifically, it established the United States Maritime Commission, and required a United States Merchant Marine that:\n\ncan carry all domestic water-borne commerce,\ncan carry a substantial portion of foreign commerce,\ncan serve as a naval auxiliary in time of war or national emergency,\nis owned and operated under the U.S. flag by U.S. citizens \"insofar as may be practicable,\"\nis composed of the best-equipped, safest, and most suitable types of vessels,\nconsists of vessels constructed in the United States, and\nconsists of vessels manned with a trained and efficient citizen personnel.\nThe Act restricted the number of aliens allowed to work on passenger ships, requiring that, by 1938, 90 percent of the crew members were U.S. citizens. Although about 4,000 Filipinos worked as merchant mariners on U.S. ships, most of these seamen were discharged in 1937 as a result of the law.[1] The Act also established federal subsidies for the construction and operation of merchant ships. Two years after the Act was passed, the U.S. Merchant Marine Cadet Corps, the forerunner to the United States Merchant Marine Academy, was established.\n\nU.S. Representative Schyler O. Bland of Virginia was known as the \"father of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936.\"\n\n==Seamen's rights==\nThe U.S.&nbsp;Congress adopted the Merchant Marine Act in early June 1920, formerly {{USC|46|688}} and codified on October 6,&nbsp;2006 as {{USC|46|30104}}. The act formalized the rights of [[Sailor|seamen]]. The Jones Act formalized the rights of seaman that have been recognized for centuries.\n{{quote|From the very beginning of American civilization, courts have protected seaman whom the courts have described as 'unprotected and in need of counsel; because they are thoughtless and require indulgence; because they are credulous and complying; and are easily overreached. They are emphatically the wards of admiralty.'<ref>Capitol Hill Hearing Testimony, Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee; Testimony by John Hickley, attorney at law. Congressional Quarterly. March 27, 2007.</ref>}}\n\nThe Jones Act allows injured sailors to make claims and obtain damages from their employers for the negligence of the ship owner, including many acts of the [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] or fellow members of the crew.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=The Jones Act and Compensation for Injured Seamen|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/workers_comp/jones_act.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> It operates simply by extending similar legislation already in place that allowed for recoveries by [[railroad]] workers and providing that this legislation also applies to sailors. Its operative provision is found at {{USC|46|30104}}, which provides:\n\n{{quote|Any sailor who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right to trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply....}}\n\nThe law allows U.S. seamen to bring actions against ship owners based on claims of unseaworthiness or negligence, rights not afforded by common international [[maritime law]].\n\nThe [[United States Supreme Court]], in the case of ''Chandris,&nbsp;Inc.,&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Latsis'', 515 U.S. 347, 115 S.Ct. 2172 (1995), has set a benchmark for determining the status of any employee as a \"Jones Act\" seaman. Workers who spend less than 30 percent of their time in the service of a vessel on navigable waters are presumed not to be seaman under the Jones Act. The Court ruled that any worker who spends more than 30 percent of his time in the service of a vessel on navigable waters qualifies as a seaman under the act. Only maritime workers who qualify as a seaman can file a suit for damages under the Jones Act.\n\nAn action under the Jones Act may be brought either in a U.S. [[United States federal courts|federal court]] or in a [[U.S. state|state court]]. The right to bring an action in state court is preserved by the \"savings to suitors\" clause, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dupin|first1=Chris|title=Decision preserves 'savings to suitors'|url=http://americanshipper.com/main/news/decision-preserves-savings-to-suitors-59386.aspx|website=American Shipper|publisher=Howard Publications, Inc.|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> The seaman-plaintiff is entitled to a [[jury trial]], a right which is not afforded in maritime law absent a statute authorizing it.\n\nSeamen have three years from the time the accident occurred to file a lawsuit. Under the Jones Act, maritime law has a [[statute of limitations]], of three years, meaning that seamen have three years from the time the injury occurred to file a lawsuit. If an injured seaman does not file a case within that three year period, the seaman's claim may be dismissed as time-barred.<ref>{{cite web |title=''Crisman v.

from commercial service to aid in the war effort.  This left the US with insufficient vessels to conduct normal trade impacting the economy. Later when the U.S. joined the war there were insufficient vessels to transport war supplies, materials, and ultimately soldiers to Europe resulting in the creation of the [[United States Shipping Board]]. The U.S. engaged in a massive ship building effort including building [[concrete ship]]s to make up for the lack of U.S. tonnage. The Jones Act was passed in order to prevent the U.S. from having insufficient maritime capacity in future wars.\n\n=== Mariners ===\nIt has been effective as the Jones Act fleet is the largest single source or merchant mariners for surge sealift operations: 3,830 mariners make up 29% of what MARAD needs to operate surge sealift during wartime. American crews frequently sail into war zones.\u00a0 Foreign crews contracted by the U.S. government during Operation Desert Storm refused to sail into a war zone.\n\nA 2011 study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found there are approximately 5 million maritime crew entries into the United States each year, and \"the overwhelming majority of seafarers entering U.S. ports are aliens.\" The study also showed that 80% of those seafarer aliens are working on passenger ships that are covered by the [[Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886]] rather than the Jones Act. The GAO said that while there are no known examples of foreign seafarer involvement in terrorist attacks and no definitive evidence of extremists infiltrating the United States on seafarer visas, \"the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) considers the illegal entry of an alien through a U.S. seaport by exploitation of maritime industry practices to be a key concern.\n\n=== Shipbuilding ===\nShipyards that build Jones Act vessels are needed to build smaller but important government vessels like auxiliary ships, cutters, and research vessels. Jones Act requirements creates additional work for these shipyards in between government orders. Defense think tank CSBA found that \u201c[w]ithout the Jones Act\u2019s requirements \u2026 it is likely the U.S. government would have few, if any, shipyards available to episodically recapitalize its smaller vessels.\u201d By keeping the industrial base working, the Jones Act ensures that the Navy and Marine Corps can spin up shipbuilding without relying on other nations.\n\n=== Homeland Security ===\nThe Jones Act includes dredging and salvage operations. Because the Jones Act creates a domestic dredging and salvage industry in the United States, it prevents the United States from depending on foreign companies to dredge naval facilities, which could create opportunities for sabotage or the depositing of underwater surveillance equipment.\n\nAdditionally, the requirement that ships in the domestic fleet be manned by crews of U.S. citizens or permanent residents reduces the likelihood foreign ships and mariners will illegally gain access to America\u2019s inland waterways and associated infrastructure. A 2011 study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found there are approximately 5 million maritime crew entries into the United States each year, and \"the overwhelming majority of seafarers entering U.S. ports are aliens.\" The study also showed that 80% of those seafarer aliens are working on passenger ships that are covered by the [[Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886]] rather than the Jones Act.

Originally a shipping term, cabotage now also covers aviation, railways, and road transport.  Cabotage is \"trade or navigation in coastal waters, or the exclusive right of a country to operate the air traffic within its territory\".<ref>\"Cabotage,\" definition, the Free Dictionary, available at http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Cabotage+trade.</ref> In the context of \"cabotage rights\", cabotage refers to the right of a company from one country to trade in another country. In aviation terms, for example, it is the right to operate within the domestic borders of another country. Most countries enact cabotage laws for reasons of economic [[protectionism]] or national security; 80% of the UN\u2019s member states with coastlines have cabotage law.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://seafarersrights.org/seafarers-subjects/cabotage/|title=Cabotage Laws of the World|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>((sources needed))\n\nThe cabotage provisions relating to the Jones Act restrict the [[Carriage of Goods|carriage of goods]] or passengers between United States ports to U.S.-built and flagged vessels. It has been codified as portions of [[Title 46 of the United States Code|46 U.S.C.]]&nbsp;<ref>46 U.S.C. \u00a755102 et seq.</ref> Generally, the Jones Act prohibits any foreign-built, foreign-owned or foreign-flagged vessel from engaging in coastwise trade within the United States. A number of other statutes affect coastwise trade and should be consulted along with the Jones Act. These include the [[Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886|Passenger Vessel Services Act]], {{USC|46|289}}, which restricts coastwise transportation of passengers, and {{USC|46|12108}}, which restricts the use of foreign vessels to commercially catch or transport fish in U.S. waters.<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode46/usc_sup_01_46_06_V_08_D_10_551.html ch.551 Coastwise Trade] Cornell Law School</ref> These provisions also require at least three-fourths (75 percent) of the crew members to be U.S.&nbsp;citizens or permanent residents. Moreover, the [[steel]] of foreign repair work on the hull and superstructure of a U.S.-flagged vessel is limited to ten percent by weight.<ref>\"Cabotage laws put Jones Act in frame: Push to tighten legislation may spark WTO review,\" Lloyd's List International.

Its purpose is \"to further the development and maintenance of an adequate and well-balanced American merchant marine, to promote the commerce of the United States, to aid in the national defense, to repeal certain former legislation, and for other purposes.\"\n\nSpecifically, it established the United States Maritime Commission, and required a United States Merchant Marine that:\n\ncan carry all domestic water-borne commerce,\ncan carry a substantial portion of foreign commerce,\ncan serve as a naval auxiliary in time of war or national emergency,\nis owned and operated under the U.S. flag by U.S. citizens \"insofar as may be practicable,\"\nis composed of the best-equipped, safest, and most suitable types of vessels,\nconsists of vessels constructed in the United States, and\nconsists of vessels manned with a trained and efficient citizen personnel.\nThe Act restricted the number of aliens allowed to work on passenger ships, requiring that, by 1938, 90 percent of the crew members were U.S. citizens. Although about 4,000 Filipinos worked as merchant mariners on U.S. ships, most of these seamen were discharged in 1937 as a result of the law.[1] The Act also established federal subsidies for the construction and operation of merchant ships. Two years after the Act was passed, the U.S. Merchant Marine Cadet Corps, the forerunner to the United States Merchant Marine Academy, was established.\n\nU.S. Representative Schyler O. Bland of Virginia was known as the \"father of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936.\"\n\n<br />\n\n==Seamen's rights==\nThe U.S.&nbsp;Congress adopted the Merchant Marine Act in early June 1920, formerly {{USC|46|688}} and codified on October 6,&nbsp;2006 as {{USC|46|30104}}. The act formalized the rights of [[Sailor|seamen]]. The Jones Act formalized the rights of seaman that have been recognized for centuries.\n{{quote|From the very beginning of American civilization, courts have protected seaman whom the courts have described as 'unprotected and in need of counsel; because they are thoughtless and require indulgence; because they are credulous and complying; and are easily overreached. They are emphatically the wards of admiralty.'<ref>Capitol Hill Hearing Testimony, Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Subcommittee; Testimony by John Hickley, attorney at law. Congressional Quarterly. March 27, 2007.</ref>}}\n\nThe Jones Act allows injured sailors to make claims and obtain damages from their employers for the negligence of the ship owner, including many acts of the [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] or fellow members of the crew.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=The Jones Act and Compensation for Injured Seamen|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/workers_comp/jones_act.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> It operates simply by extending similar legislation already in place that allowed for recoveries by [[railroad]] workers and providing that this legislation also applies to sailors. Its operative provision is found at {{USC|46|30104}}, which provides:\n\n{{quote|Any sailor who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment may, at his election, maintain an action for damages at law, with the right to trial by jury, and in such action all statutes of the United States modifying or extending the common-law right or remedy in cases of personal injury to railway employees shall apply....}}\n\nThe law allows U.S. seamen to bring actions against ship owners based on claims of unseaworthiness or negligence, rights not afforded by common international [[maritime law]].\n\nThe [[United States Supreme Court]], in the case of ''Chandris,&nbsp;Inc.,&nbsp;v.&nbsp;Latsis'', 515 U.S. 347, 115 S.Ct. 2172 (1995), has set a benchmark for determining the status of any employee as a \"Jones Act\" seaman. Workers who spend less than 30 percent of their time in the service of a vessel on navigable waters are presumed not to be seaman under the Jones Act. The Court ruled that any worker who spends more than 30 percent of his time in the service of a vessel on navigable waters qualifies as a seaman under the act. Only maritime workers who qualify as a seaman can file a suit for damages under the Jones Act.\n\nAn action under the Jones Act may be brought either in a U.S. [[United States federal courts|federal court]] or in a [[U.S. state|state court]]. The right to bring an action in state court is preserved by the \"savings to suitors\" clause, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dupin|first1=Chris|title=Decision preserves 'savings to suitors'|url=http://americanshipper.com/main/news/decision-preserves-savings-to-suitors-59386.aspx|website=American Shipper|publisher=Howard Publications, Inc.|accessdate=6 May 2017}}</ref> The seaman-plaintiff is entitled to a [[jury trial]], a right which is not afforded in maritime law absent a statute authorizing it.\n\nSeamen have three years from the time the accident occurred to file a lawsuit. Under the Jones Act, maritime law has a [[statute of limitations]], of three years, meaning that seamen have three years from the time the injury occurred to file a lawsuit. If an injured seaman does not file a case within that three year period, the seaman's claim may be dismissed as time-barred.<ref>{{cite web |title=''Crisman v.

besides the Jones Act affect rates, it is difficult to isolate the exact extent to which freight rates between the United States and Puerto Rico are affected by the Jones Act.\" The report also addresses what would happen \"under a full exemption from the Act, the rules and requirements that would apply to all carriers would need to be determined.\"  The report continues that \"[w]hile proponents of this change expect increased competition and greater availability of vessels to suit shippers' needs, it is also possible that the reliability and other beneficial aspects of the current

from commercial service to aid in the war effort.  This left the US with insufficient vessels to conduct normal trade impacting the economy. Later when the U.S. joined the war there were insufficient vessels to transport war supplies, materials, and ultimately soldiers to Europe resulting in the creation of the [[United States Shipping Board]]. The U.S. engaged in a massive ship building effort including building [[concrete ship]]s to make up for the lack of U.S. tonnage. The Jones Act was passed in order to prevent the U.S. from having insufficient maritime capacity in future wars.\n\n=== '''Mariners''' ===\nIt has been effective as the Jones Act fleet is the largest single source or merchant mariners for surge sealift operations: 3,830 mariners make up 29% of what MARAD needs to operate surge sealift during wartime. American crews frequently sail into war zones.\u00a0 Foreign crews contracted by the U.S. government during Operation Desert Storm refused to sail into a war zone.\n\nA 2011 study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found there are approximately 5 million maritime crew entries into the United States each year, and \"the overwhelming majority of seafarers entering U.S. ports are aliens.\" The study also showed that 80% of those seafarer aliens are working on passenger ships that are covered by the [[Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886]] rather than the Jones Act. The GAO said that while there are no known examples of foreign seafarer involvement in terrorist attacks and no definitive evidence of extremists infiltrating the United States on seafarer visas, \"the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) considers the illegal entry of an alien through a U.S. seaport by exploitation of maritime industry practices to be a key concern.\n\n=== '''Shipbuilding''' ===\nShipyards that build Jones Act vessels are needed to build smaller but important government vessels like auxiliary ships, cutters, and research vessels. Jones Act requirements creates additional work for these shipyards in between government orders. Defense think tank CSBA found that \u201c[w]ithout the Jones Act\u2019s requirements \u2026 it is likely the U.S. government would have few, if any, shipyards available to episodically recapitalize its smaller vessels.\u201d By keeping the industrial base working, the Jones Act ensures that the Navy and Marine Corps can spin up shipbuilding without relying on other nations.\n\n=== '''Homeland Security''' ===\nThe Jones Act includes dredging and salvage operations. Because the Jones Act creates a domestic dredging and salvage industry in the United States, it prevents the United States from depending on foreign companies to dredge naval facilities, which could create opportunities for sabotage or the depositing of underwater surveillance equipment.\n\nAdditionally, the requirement that ships in the domestic fleet be manned by crews of U.S. citizens or permanent residents reduces the likelihood foreign ships and mariners will illegally gain access to America\u2019s inland waterways and associated infrastructure. A 2011 study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found there are approximately 5 million maritime crew entries into the United States each year, and \"the overwhelming majority of seafarers entering U.S. ports are aliens.\" The study also showed that 80% of those seafarer aliens are working on passenger ships that are covered by the [[Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886]] rather than the Jones Act. The GAO said that while there are no known examples of foreign seafarer involvement in terrorist attacks and no definitive evidence of extremists infiltrating the United States on seafarer visas, \"the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) considers the illegal entry of an alien through a U.S. seaport by exploitation of maritime industry practices to be a key concern.\"\n\n=== '''Economic Security''' ===\nThe Jones Act\u2019s requirements also apply to shipping between the contiguous United States and overseas territories and states.\u00a0 The Jones Act reduces the ability of adversaries to interfere with commercial links to the Continental United States.\n\n=== Importation of liquefied natural gas ===\nBecause of the lack of Jones Act-compliant [[liquefied natural gas]] tankers, the Northeast of the U.S. imported liquefied natural gas from Russia in order to avoid shortages in 2018.<ref>{{cite news |last=Malik |first=Naureen |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-03/why-the-u-s-imports-lng-despite-its-gas-export-boom-quicktake |title=Why the U.S. Imports LNG Despite Its Gas-Export Boom |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=January 3, 2019 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103194742/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-03/why-the-u-s-imports-lng-despite-its-gas-export-boom-quicktake |archivedate=January 3, 2019 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Buxbaum |first=Peter |url=http://www.globaltrademag.com/global-logistics/jones-act-forces-new-england-import-gas-russia/ |title=Jones Act Forces New England to Import Gas From Russia |work=Global Trade Magazine |date=January 24, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115012145/http://www.globaltrademag.com/global-logistics/jones-act-forces-new-england-import-gas-russia/ |archivedate=January 15, 2019 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Support==\nSupporters of the Jones Act maintain that the legislation is of strategic economic and wartime interest to the United States. The act, they say, protects the nation's sealift capability and its ability to produce commercial ships. In addition, the act is seen as a vital factor in helping maintain a viable workforce of trained merchant mariners for commerce and national emergencies. Supporters also argue that allowing foreign-flagged ships to engage in commerce in domestic American sea lanes would undermine U.S. wage, tax, safety, and environmental standards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://csbaonline.org/research/publications/strengthening-the-u.s-defense-maritime-industrial-base-a-plan-to-improve-maritime-industrys-contribution-to-national-security|title=Strengthening the US Defense Maritime Industrial Base|last=Clark|first=Bryan|date=|website=CSBA|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=March 2, 2020}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[Lexington Institute]], the Jones Act is also vital to national security and plays a role in safeguarding America's borders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lexingtoninstitute.org/venerable-jones-act-provides-important-barrier-terrorist-infiltration-homeland/|title=Lexington Institute|date=2016-03-24|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maritime-executive.com/magazine/the-importance-of-the-jones-act-fleet-to-us-homeland-security|title=The Importance of the Jones Act Fleet to U.S. Homeland Security|access-date=2016-06-24}}</ref> The Lexington Institute stated in a June 2016 study that the Jones Act plays a role in strengthening U.S. border security and helping to prevent international terrorism.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lexingtoninstitute.org/jones-act-homeland-security-21st-century/|title=Lexington Institute|date=2016-06-23|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-24}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Protectionism===\n\nCritics claim the Jones Act is [[Protectionism|protectionist]], and point to a 2002 report by the [[United States International Trade Commission]] that estimated the savings for the U.S. economy that would result from the repeal or amendment of the Jones Act.<ref name=\"Quartz2017\">{{cite news |last=Olsen |first=Erik |url=https://qz.com/1032288/how-a-100-year-old-american-law-helps-make-your-commute-miserable/ |title=An arcane American law protected by powerful interests is causing insane traffic jams |work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]] |date=August 7, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807120540/https://qz.com/1032288/how-a-100-year-old-american-law-helps-make-your-commute-miserable/ |archivedate=August 7, 2017 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 }}</ref> Critics contend that the Act results in higher costs for moving cargo between U.S. ports, particularly for Americans living in Hawaii, Alaska, Guam, and Puerto Rico.<ref>Lin, Tom C.W., [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3454210 Americans, Almost and Forgotten], 107 California Law Review (2019)</ref><ref name=\"Cato\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cato.org/project-on-jones-act-reform |title=Cato Institute Project on Jones Act Reform |publisher=[[Cato Institute]] |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628165252/https://www.cato.org/project-on-jones-act-reform |archivedate=June 28, 2018 |accessdate=May 11, 2019 }}</ref> \n\nA 2019 study by the [[OECD]] estimated that the economic gains to the U.S. economy from the repeal of Jones Act would range from an added $19 billion up to $64 billion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guilhoto|first=Joaquim|last2=Gourdon|first2=Karin|date=2019-04-12|title=Local content requirements and their economic effect on shipbuilding|url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/science-and-technology/local-content-requirements-and-their-economic-effect-on-shipbuilding_90316781-en|journal=|language=en|publisher=[[OECD]]|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1787/90316781-en|via=|series=OECD Science, Technology and Industry Policy Papers}}</ref>\n\n==Efforts at repeal==\n\nLegislative efforts to repeal the Jones Act have been repeatedly introduced in Congress since 2010 in the form of the Open America's Waters Act, championed by the late Senator [[John McCain]] and by Utah Senator [[Mike Lee (American politician)|Mike Lee]], but have not passed to become law.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cavanaugh |first=J.
