Bias can emerge due to many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. Algorithmic bias is found across platforms, including but not limited to [[Search engine bias|search engine results]] and social media platforms, and can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing [[Bias|social biases]] of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect \"systematic and unfair\" discrimination. This bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the 2018 European Union's [[General Data Protection Regulation]].\n\nAs algorithms expand their ability to organize society, politics, institutions, and behavior, sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world. Because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise, and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes. Bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software's initial design.\n\nAlgorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of [[online hate speech]]. Problems in understanding, researching, and discovering algorithmic bias stem from the proprietary nature of algorithms, which are typically treated as trade secrets. Even when full transparency is provided, the complexity of certain algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning. Furthermore, algorithms may change, or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis. In many cases, even within a single website or application, there is no single \"algorithm\" to examine, but a network of many interrelated programs and data inputs, even between users of the same service.\n\n== Definitions ==\n[[File:A computer program for evaluating forestry opportunities under three investment criteria (1969) (20385500690).jpg|thumb|A 1969 diagram for how a simple computer program makes decisions, illustrating a very simple algorithm.]]\nAlgorithms are [[Algorithm characterizations|difficult to define]],<ref name=\"Striphas\">{{cite web|url=http://culturedigitally.org/2012/02/what-is-an-algorithm/|title=What is an Algorithm? \u2013 Culture Digitally|last1=Striphas|first1=Ted|website=culturedigitally.org|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref> but may be generally understood as lists of instructions that determine how programs read, collect, process, and analyze [[data]] to generate output.<ref name=\"Cormen\">{{cite book|title=Introduction to algorithms|last1=Cormen|first1=Thomas H.|last2=Leiserson|first2=Charles E.|last3=Rivest|first3=Ronald L.|last4=Stein|first4=Clifford|date=2009|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-03384-8|edition=3rd|location=Cambridge, Mass.|page=5}}</ref>{{rp|13}} For a rigorous technical introduction, see [[Algorithm]]s.

For example, a [[credit score]] algorithm may deny a loan without being unfair, if it is consistently weighing relevant financial criteria.

Data may be collected without crucial external context: for example, when [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] software is used by surveillance cameras, but evaluated by remote staff in another country or region, or evaluated by non-human algorithms with no awareness of what takes place beyond the camera's [[Visual field|field of vision]]. This could create an incomplete understanding of a crime scene, for example, potentially mistaking bystanders for those who commit the crime.<ref name=\"Graham\" />{{rp|574}}\n\nLastly, technical bias can be created by attempting to formalize decisions into concrete steps on the assumption that human behavior works in the same way. For example, software weighs data points to determine whether a defendant should accept a plea bargain, while ignoring the impact of emotion on a jury.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|332}} Another unintended result of this form of bias was found in the plagiarism-detection software [[Turnitin]], which compares student-written texts to information found online and returns a probability score that the student's work is copied. Because the software compares long strings of text, it is more likely to identify non-native speakers of English than native speakers, as the latter group might be better able to change individual words, break up strings of plagiarized text, or obscure copied passages through synonyms. Because it is easier for native speakers to evade detection as a result of the technical constraints of the software, this creates a scenario where Turnitin identifies foreign-speakers of English for plagiarism while allowing more native-speakers to evade detection.<ref name=\"Introna2\" />{{rp|21\u201322}}\n\n=== Emergent ===\n[[Emergent properties|Emergent]] bias is the result of the use and reliance on algorithms across new or unanticipated contexts.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|334}} Algorithms may not have been adjusted to consider new forms of knowledge, such as new drugs or medical breakthroughs, new laws, business models, or shifting cultural norms.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|334,336}} This may exclude groups through technology, without providing clear outlines to understand who is responsible for their exclusion.<ref name=\"IntronaWood\" />{{rp|179}}<ref name=\"Tewell\" />{{rp|294}} Similarly, problems may emerge when [[training data]] (the samples \"fed\" to a machine, by which it models certain conclusions) do not align with contexts that an algorithm encounters in the real world.<ref name=\"Gillespie\">{{cite web|url=http://culturedigitally.org/2014/06/algorithm-draft-digitalkeyword/|title=Algorithm [draft] [#digitalkeywords] \u2013 Culture Digitally|last1=Gillespie|first1=Tarleton|website=culturedigitally.org|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, an example of emergent bias was identified in the software used to place US medical students into residencies, the National Residency Match Program (NRMP).<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|338}} The algorithm was designed at a time when few married couples would seek residencies together. As more women entered medical schools, more students were likely to request a residency alongside their partners. The process called for each applicant to provide a list of preferences for placement across the US, which was then sorted and assigned when a hospital and an applicant both agreed to a match. In the case of married couples where both sought residencies, the algorithm weighed the location choices of the higher-rated partner first. The result was a frequent assignment of highly preferred schools to the first partner and lower-preferred schools to the second partner, rather than sorting for compromises in placement preference.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|338}}<ref name=\"Roth\">{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=A.

For example, data collected about web-browsing patterns may align with signals marking sensitive data (such as race or sexual orientation). By selecting according to certain behavior or browsing patterns, the end effect would be almost identical to discrimination through the use of direct race or sexual orientation data.<ref name=\"GoodmanFlaxman2016\" />{{rp|6}} In other cases, the algorithm draws conclusions from correlations, without being able to understand those correlations. For example, one triage program gave lower priority to asthmatics who had pneumonia than asthmatics who did not have pneumonia. The program algorithm did this because it simply compared survival rates: asthmatics with pneumonia are at the highest risk. Historically, for this same reason, hospitals typically give such asthmatics the best and most immediate care.<ref name=\"Kuang\">{{cite news|last1=Kuang|first1=Cliff|title=Can A.I.

For example, machines may require that users can read, write, or understand numbers, or relate to an interface using metaphors that they do not understand.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|334}} These exclusions can become compounded, as biased or exclusionary technology is more deeply integrated into society.<ref name=\"IntronaWood\" />{{rp|179}}\n\nApart from exclusion, unanticipated uses may emerge from the end user relying on the software rather than their own knowledge. In one example, an unanticipated user group led to algorithmic bias in the UK, when the British National Act Program was created as a [[Proof of concept|proof-of-concept]] by computer scientists and immigration lawyers to evaluate suitability for [[British nationality law|British citizenship]]. The designers had access to legal expertise beyond the end users in immigration offices, whose understanding of both software and immigration law would likely have been unsophisticated. The agents administering the questions relied entirely on the software, which excluded alternative pathways to citizenship, and used the software even after new case laws and legal interpretations led the algorithm to become outdated. As a result of designing an algorithm for users assumed to be legally savvy on immigration law, the software's algorithm indirectly led to bias in favor of applicants who fit a very narrow set of legal criteria set by the algorithm, rather than by the more broader criteria of UK immigration law.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|342}}\n\n==== Feedback loops ====\nEmergent bias may also create a [[feedback loop]], or recursion, if data collected for an algorithm results in real-world responses which are fed back into the algorithm.<ref name=\"JouvenalPredPol\">{{cite web|last1=Jouvenal|first1=Justin|title=Police are using software to predict crime.

Bias can emerge due to many factors, including but not limited to the design of the algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. Algorithmic bias is found across platforms, including but not limited to [[Search engine bias|search engine results]] and social media platforms, and can have impacts ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing [[Bias|social biases]] of race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity. The study of algorithmic bias is most concerned with algorithms that reflect \"systematic and unfair\" discrimination. This bias has only recently been addressed in legal frameworks, such as the 2018 European Union's [[General Data Protection Regulation]].\n\nAs algorithms expand their ability to organize society, politics, institutions, and behavior, sociologists have become concerned with the ways in which unanticipated output and manipulation of data can impact the physical world. Because algorithms are often considered to be neutral and unbiased, they can inaccurately project greater authority than human expertise, and in some cases, reliance on algorithms can displace human responsibility for their outcomes. Bias can enter into algorithmic systems as a result of pre-existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; because of technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by audiences who are not considered in the software's initial design.\n\nAlgorithmic bias has been cited in cases ranging from election outcomes to the spread of [[online hate speech]]. Problems in understanding, researching, and discovering algorithmic bias stem from the proprietary nature of algorithms, which are typically treated as trade secrets. Even when full transparency is provided, the complexity of certain algorithms poses a barrier to understanding their functioning. Furthermore, algorithms may change, or respond to input or output in ways that cannot be anticipated or easily reproduced for analysis. In many cases, even within a single website or application, there is no single \"algorithm\" to examine, but a network of many interrelated programs and data inputs, even between users of the same service.\n\n== Definitions ==\n[[File:A computer program for evaluating forestry opportunities under three investment criteria (1969) (20385500690).jpg|thumb|A 1969 diagram for how a simple computer program makes decisions, illustrating a very simple algorithm.]]\nAlgorithms are [[Algorithm characterizations|difficult to define]],<ref name=\"Striphas\">{{cite web|url=http://culturedigitally.org/2012/02/what-is-an-algorithm/|title=What is an Algorithm? \u2013 Culture Digitally|last1=Striphas|first1=Ted|website=culturedigitally.org|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref> but may be generally understood as lists of instructions that determine how programs read, collect, process, and analyze [[data]] to generate output.<ref name=\"Cormen\">{{cite book|title=Introduction to algorithms|last1=Cormen|first1=Thomas H.|last2=Leiserson|first2=Charles E.|last3=Rivest|first3=Ronald L.|last4=Stein|first4=Clifford|date=2009|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-03384-8|edition=3rd|location=Cambridge, Mass.|page=5}}</ref>{{rp|13}} For a rigorous technical introduction, see [[Algorithm]]s.

For example, a [[credit score]] algorithm may deny a loan without being unfair, if it is consistently weighing relevant financial criteria. If the algorithm recommends loans to one group of users, but denies loans to another set of nearly identical users based on unrelated criteria, and if this behavior can be repeated across multiple occurrences, an algorithm can be described as ''biased''.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|332}} This bias may be intentional or unintentional (for example, it can come from biased data obtained from a worker that previously did the job the algorithm is going to do from now on).\n\n== Methods ==\nBias can be introduced to an algorithm in several ways.

Another example comes from determining criteria for what is included and excluded from results. This criteria could present unanticipated outcomes for search results, such as in flight-recommendation software that omits flights that do not follow the sponsoring airline's flight paths.<ref name=\"TowCenter\" /> Algorithms may also display an ''uncertainty bias'', offering more confident assessments when larger [[data set]]s are available.

If the [[random number generation]] mechanism is not truly random, it can introduce bias, for example, by skewing selections toward items at the end or beginning of a list.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|332}}\n\nA ''decontextualized algorithm'' uses unrelated information to sort results, for example, a flight-pricing algorithm that sorts results by alphabetical order would be biased in favor of American Airlines over United Airlines.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|332}} The opposite may also apply, in which results are evaluated in contexts different from which they are collected. Data may be collected without crucial external context: for example, when [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]] software is used by surveillance cameras, but evaluated by remote staff in another country or region, or evaluated by non-human algorithms with no awareness of what takes place beyond the camera's [[Visual field|field of vision]]. This could create an incomplete understanding of a crime scene, for example, potentially mistaking bystanders for those who commit the crime.<ref name=\"Graham\" />{{rp|574}}\n\nLastly, technical bias can be created by attempting to formalize decisions into concrete steps on the assumption that human behavior works in the same way. For example, software weighs data points to determine whether a defendant should accept a plea bargain, while ignoring the impact of emotion on a jury.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|332}} Another unintended result of this form of bias was found in the plagiarism-detection software [[Turnitin]], which compares student-written texts to information found online and returns a probability score that the student's work is copied. Because the software compares long strings of text, it is more likely to identify non-native speakers of English than native speakers, as the latter group might be better able to change individual words, break up strings of plagiarized text, or obscure copied passages through synonyms. Because it is easier for native speakers to evade detection as a result of the technical constraints of the software, this creates a scenario where Turnitin identifies foreign-speakers of English for plagiarism while allowing more native-speakers to evade detection.<ref name=\"Introna2\" />{{rp|21\u201322}}\n\n=== Emergent ===\n[[Emergent properties|Emergent]] bias is the result of the use and reliance on algorithms across new or unanticipated contexts.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|334}} Algorithms may not have been adjusted to consider new forms of knowledge, such as new drugs or medical breakthroughs, new laws, business models, or shifting cultural norms.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|334,336}} This may exclude groups through technology, without providing clear outlines to understand who is responsible for their exclusion.<ref name=\"IntronaWood\" />{{rp|179}}<ref name=\"Tewell\" />{{rp|294}} Similarly, problems may emerge when [[training data]] (the samples \"fed\" to a machine, by which it models certain conclusions) do not align with contexts that an algorithm encounters in the real world.<ref name=\"Gillespie\">{{cite web|url=http://culturedigitally.org/2014/06/algorithm-draft-digitalkeyword/|title=Algorithm [draft] [#digitalkeywords] \u2013 Culture Digitally|last1=Gillespie|first1=Tarleton|website=culturedigitally.org|accessdate=20 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, an example of emergent bias was identified in the software used to place US medical students into residencies, the National Residency Match Program (NRMP).<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|338}} The algorithm was designed at a time when few married couples would seek residencies together. As more women entered medical schools, more students were likely to request a residency alongside their partners. The process called for each applicant to provide a list of preferences for placement across the US, which was then sorted and assigned when a hospital and an applicant both agreed to a match. In the case of married couples where both sought residencies, the algorithm weighed the location choices of the higher-rated partner first. The result was a frequent assignment of highly preferred schools to the first partner and lower-preferred schools to the second partner, rather than sorting for compromises in placement preference.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|338}}<ref name=\"Roth\">{{cite journal|last1=Roth|first1=A.

For example, data collected about web-browsing patterns may align with signals marking sensitive data (such as race or sexual orientation). By selecting according to certain behavior or browsing patterns, the end effect would be almost identical to discrimination through the use of direct race or sexual orientation data.<ref name=\"GoodmanFlaxman2016\" />{{rp|6}} In other cases, the algorithm draws conclusions from correlations, without being able to understand those correlations. For example, one triage program gave lower priority to asthmatics who had pneumonia than asthmatics who did not have pneumonia. The program algorithm did this because it simply compared survival rates: asthmatics with pneumonia are at the highest risk. Historically, for this same reason, hospitals typically give such asthmatics the best and most immediate care.<ref name=\"Kuang\">{{cite news|last1=Kuang|first1=Cliff|title=Can A.I.

For example, machines may require that users can read, write, or understand numbers, or relate to an interface using metaphors that they do not understand.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|334}} These exclusions can become compounded, as biased or exclusionary technology is more deeply integrated into society.<ref name=\"IntronaWood\" />{{rp|179}}\n\nApart from exclusion, unanticipated uses may emerge from the end user relying on the software rather than their own knowledge. In one example, an unanticipated user group led to algorithmic bias in the UK, when the British National Act Program was created as a [[Proof of concept|proof-of-concept]] by computer scientists and immigration lawyers to evaluate suitability for [[British nationality law|British citizenship]]. The designers had access to legal expertise beyond the end users in immigration offices, whose understanding of both software and immigration law would likely have been unsophisticated. The agents administering the questions relied entirely on the software, which excluded alternative pathways to citizenship, and used the software even after new case laws and legal interpretations led the algorithm to become outdated. As a result of designing an algorithm for users assumed to be legally savvy on immigration law, the software's algorithm indirectly led to bias in favor of applicants who fit a very narrow set of legal criteria set by the algorithm, rather than by the more broader criteria of UK immigration law.<ref name=\"FriedmanNissenbaum\" />{{rp|342}}\n\n==== Feedback loops ====\nEmergent bias may also create a [[feedback loop]], or recursion, if data collected for an algorithm results in real-world responses which are fed back into the algorithm.<ref name=\"JouvenalPredPol\">{{cite web|last1=Jouvenal|first1=Justin|title=Police are using software to predict crime.

By the age of four she had started collecting [[ladybird]] beetles and caterpillars and taking a tame [[quail]] to bed with her. [[World War I]] broke on the eve of Miriam's sixth birthday in 1914, while the Rothschilds were holidaying in [[Austro-Hungary]]. They hurried home on the first westward train but, unable to pay, had to borrow money from a Hungarian passenger who commented \"This is the proudest moment of my life. Never did I think that I should be asked to lend money to a Rothschild!\" Her father died when she was 15 and she became closer to her uncle. She was educated at home until the age of 17, when she demanded to go to school. She thence attended evening classes in [[zoology]] at [[Chelsea College of Science and Technology]] and classes during the day in literature at [[Bedford College, London]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rothschild |first1=Miriam |url=http://gdc.galegroup.com.ezphost.dur.ac.uk/gdc/artemis/NewspapersDetailsPage/NewspapersDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=false&displayGroupName=DVI-Newspapers&docIndex=1&source=fullList&prodId=TTDA&mode=view&limiter=&display-query=OQE+miriam+rothschild&contentModules=&action=e&sortBy=&windowstate=normal&currPage=1&dviSelectedPage=&scanId=&query=OQE+miriam+rothschild&search_within_results=&p=TTDA&catId=&u=duruni&displayGroups=&documentId=GALE%7CIF0502894830&activityType=BasicSearch&failOverType=&commentary= |accessdate=2 January 2019 |issue=68291 |publisher=The Times |date=22 January 2005}}</ref>\n\n==1930s\u20131940s==\nDuring the 1930s she made a name for herself at the Marine Biological Station in [[Plymouth]], studying the [[mollusc]] ''[[Nucula]]'' and its [[trematode]] parasites (Rothschild 1936, 1938a, 1938b).

She was the first person to work out the flea's jumping mechanism. She also studied the flea's reproductive cycle and linked this, in [[rabbit]]s, to the hormonal changes within the host. Her New Naturalist book on parasitism (''Fleas, Flukes and Cuckoos'') was a huge success. Its title can be explained as: external parasites (e.g. fleas), internal parasites (e.g. flukes) and others (the cuckoo is a 'brood parasite'). The Rothschild Collection of Fleas (founded by Charles Rothschild) is now part of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] collection, and her catalogue of the collection (in collaboration with [[George Henry Evans Hopkins|G. H. E. Hopkins]]) is a master-work. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nRothschild was a member of the Oxford genetics school during the 1960s, where she met the [[ecological genetics|ecological geneticist]] [[E.B.

By the age of four she had started collecting [[ladybird]] beetles and caterpillars and taking a tame [[quail]] to bed with her. [[World War I]] broke on the eve of Miriam's sixth birthday in 1914, while the Rothschilds were holidaying in [[Austro-Hungary]]. They hurried home on the first westward train but, unable to pay, had to borrow money from a Hungarian passenger who commented \"This is the proudest moment of my life. Never did I think that I should be asked to lend money to a Rothschild!\" Her father died when she was 15 and she became closer to her uncle. She was educated at home until the age of 17, when she demanded to go to school. She thence attended evening classes in [[zoology]] at [[Chelsea College of Science and Technology]] and classes during the day in literature at [[Bedford College, London]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rothschild |first1=Miriam |url=http://gdc.galegroup.com.ezphost.dur.ac.uk/gdc/artemis/NewspapersDetailsPage/NewspapersDetailsWindow?disableHighlighting=false&displayGroupName=DVI-Newspapers&docIndex=1&source=fullList&prodId=TTDA&mode=view&limiter=&display-query=OQE+miriam+rothschild&contentModules=&action=e&sortBy=&windowstate=normal&currPage=1&dviSelectedPage=&scanId=&query=OQE+miriam+rothschild&search_within_results=&p=TTDA&catId=&u=duruni&displayGroups=&documentId=GALE%7CIF0502894830&activityType=BasicSearch&failOverType=&commentary= |accessdate=2 January 2019 |issue=68291 |publisher=The Times |date=22 January 2005}}</ref>\n\n==1930s\u20131940s==\nDuring the 1930s she made a name for herself at the Marine Biological Station in [[Plymouth]], studying the [[mollusc]] ''[[Nucula]]'' and its [[trematode]] parasites (Rothschild 1936, 1938a, 1938b). Because of her inherited wealth, she never had to apply for any grants or funding.

She was the first person to work out the flea's jumping mechanism. She also studied the flea's reproductive cycle and linked this, in [[rabbit]]s, to the hormonal changes within the host. Her New Naturalist book on parasitism (''Fleas, Flukes and Cuckoos'') was a huge success. Its title can be explained as: external parasites (e.g. fleas), internal parasites (e.g. flukes) and others (the cuckoo is a 'brood parasite'). The Rothschild Collection of Fleas (founded by Charles Rothschild) is now part of the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] collection, and her catalogue of the collection (in collaboration with [[George Henry Evans Hopkins|G. H. E. Hopkins]]) is a master-work. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}\n\nRothschild was a member of the Oxford genetics school during the 1960s, where she met the [[ecological genetics|ecological geneticist]] [[E.B. Ford]]. She was one of the few women with whom Ford was on good terms and she campaigned with Ford for the legalisation of [[homosexuality]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oundlechronicle.com/articles/features/197 |title=Dame Miriam Rothschild, obituary |publisher=The Oundle Chronicle (blog) |accessdate=6 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008215721/http://www.oundlechronicle.com/articles/features/197/ |archivedate=8 October 2007 }}</ref>\n\nRothschild authored books about her father (''Rothschild's Reserves &ndash; time and fragile nature'') and her uncle (''Dear Lord Rothschild''). She wrote about 350 papers on entomology, zoology and other subjects.\n\n==Funding for schizophrenia research and art therapy==\nRothschild founded the 'Schizophrenia Research Fund' in 1962, an independent registered charity formed \u201cto advance the better understanding, prevention, treatment and cure of all forms of mental illness and in particular of the illness known as Schizophrenia\u201d. In March 2006, following her death, the name of the Fund was changed in her memory to the 'Miriam Rothschild Schizophrenia Research Fund'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srf-uk.com/|title=Schizophrenia Research Fund|website=www.srf-uk.com}}</ref> The pioneer of British [[Art Therapy]], [[Edward Adamson]] and his partner and collaborator, John Timlin, were regular visitors to [[Ashton Wold]].<ref>Adamson, E.

the near-future, on a large isolated island in the South China Sea, where human-like \"hosts\" populate several themed parks, including the titular Western-themed Westworld. The hosts nominal run on daily narratives created by the park operators to interact with the guests, resetting their programming and memories each night. Hosts cannot harm humans, which allows guests to live out carnal pleasures, including sexual and violent desires against hosts. \n\nOver the course of the first two seasons, it is shown that the park and the technology behind the hosts is based on Dr. Robert Ford and Dr. Arnold Weber, with the park's construction and operation funded by the Delos Corporation and opened around the early 2020s. In 2052, events led to the hosts gaining [[sentience]] (shown through season one) and revolting against the guests and Delos shareholders, technicians, and security forces in the park. In the few weeks that followed, shown through the second season, additional Delos security forces arrive to quell the hosts' rebellion, killing most of them and preventing any from escaping the park. \n\nThe third season takes place about six years later in 2058, as some hosts have managed to escape the parks to live among the humans to continue their revenge. A large company, Incite, has created a large [[artificial intelligence]] system called Rehoboam ostensibly designed to monitor protection of private data, but, as some hosts have discovered, has been used to control behavior of individuals on a mass scale.\n\n==Main characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 115\n\n| image1    = Evan Rachel Wood July 2017.jpg\n| caption1  = [[Evan Rachel Wood]] (Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image2    = Thandie Newton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption2  = [[Thandie Newton]] (Maeve Millay)\n\n| image3    = Jeffrey Wright by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption3  = [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] (Bernard Lowe & Arnold Weber)\n\n| image4    = James Marsden by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption4  = [[James Marsden]] (Teddy Flood)\n\n| image5    = Ingrid Bolso Berdal by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption5  = [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] (Armistice)\n\n| image6    = Luke Hemsworth by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption6  = [[Luke Hemsworth]] (Ashley Stubbs)\n\n| image7    = Sidse Babett Knudsen C\u00e9sar 2016.jpg\n| caption7  = [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] (Theresa Cullen)\n\n| image8    = Simon Quarterman by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption8  = [[Simon Quarterman]] (Lee Sizemore)\n\n| image9    = Rodrigo Santoro by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption9  = [[Rodrigo Santoro]] (Hector Escaton)\n\n| image10    = Angela Sarafyan by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption10  = [[Angela Sarafyan]] (Clementine Pennyfeather)\n\n| image11    = Shannon Woodward by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption11  = [[Shannon Woodward]] (Elsie Hughes)\n\n| image12   = Ed Harris by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption12 = [[Ed Harris]] (William \"Man in Black\")\n\n| image13  = Jimmi Simpson by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption13 = [[Jimmi Simpson]] (William)\n\n| image14   = AnthonyHopkins10TIFF.jpg\n| caption14 = [[Anthony Hopkins]] (Robert Ford)\n\n| image15   = Ben Barnes by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption15 = [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] (Logan Delos)\n\n| image16   = Clifton Collins Jr 2013 (cropped).jpg\n| caption16 = [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] (Lawrence Gonzalez / El Lazo)\n\n| image17   = Tessa Thompson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption17 = [[Tessa Thompson]] (Charlotte Hale & Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image18   = TalulahRileyAug09.jpg\n| caption18 = [[Talulah Riley]] (Angela)\n\n| image19   = Katja herbers-1453203980 (cropped).jpg\n| caption19 = [[Katja Herbers]] (Emily Grace)\n\n| image20   = Zahn McClarnon 2016.png\n| caption20 = [[Zahn McClarnon]] (Akecheta)\n\n| image21   = Aaron Paul by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption21 = [[Aaron Paul]] (Caleb Nichols)\n\n| image22   = Vincent Cassel le moine.jpg\n| caption22 = [[Vincent Cassel]] (Engerraund Serac)\n}}\n===Dolores Abernathy===\n'''Dolores Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Evan Rachel Wood]] and is one of the series' central characters. She is the oldest host still working in the park. Dolores is a rancher's daughter who discovers her entire life is an elaborately constructed lie. Her aesthetic drew influences from [[Andrew Wyeth]]'s painting ''[[Christina's World]]'' as well as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray|title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 16, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> Later in the series, she is also portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]] in a [[#Charlotte Hale|host replica of Charlotte Hale]].\n\n===Maeve Millay===\n'''Maeve Millay''' is portrayed by [[Thandie Newton]]. Maeve is a host who acts as the [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] of Sweetwater, the largest town in Westworld. Through Dolores, she becomes aware that her life has been a lie, and recalls memories of raising a daughter before she was killed by a guest. She is able to \"wake up\" within the Mesa, where she coerces technician Felix to alter her programming, making her more intelligent and able to control other hosts with her voice, and befriends Hector and Armistice to help protect her. At the end of the first season, Felix is able to help her leave the Westworld park. However, she is drawn back on the promise of finding her daughter, even though she is aware this daughter was from a previous narrative. The second season focuses on her attempts to locate her daughter and she gains the ability to communicate with and control other hosts through a network that connects them. Maeve plays a key role in rallying the hosts and escorting them to the Sublime, but she is killed before she can enter herself. She is revived and placed in another park, Warworld, but quickly realises it is a simulation. She orchestrates an escape into the real world and is caught by Serac, who enlists her help in fighting Dolores.\n\n===Bernard Lowe===\n'''Bernard Lowe''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He is the head of the Westworld Programming Division and creator of artificial people. Later in the plot, he is revealed to be a host under Ford's control, made in the image of Westworld's co-creator, Arnold Weber, and based on Ford's and Dolores' memories of him. \"Bernard Lowe\" is an [[anagram]] of \"Arnold Weber\". He plays a key role in season 2 when he is interrogated by QA, Delos' security team. Bernard discovers Delos' practice of scanning guests' minds to try and recreat their consciousness. He enters the Cradle, a repository of all host personalities that is intended as a backup and finds Ford's consciousness residing there. Ford takes over Bernard's mind to carry out his plan to rescue the hosts. Realising Ford's intentions, Bernard deliberately scrambles his own memories to slow QA down and allow the plan to succeed. Dolores later kills him and smuggles his pearl out of the park. She creates a new body for him and tells Bernard that they need each other to prevent each other from going too far.\n\n===Arnold Weber===\n'''Arnold Weber''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]].

When the park was nearing opening, 30+ years before the \"present day\" of the show's timeline, Arnold had not yet been able to succeed in this, having concluded that the path to sentience was not simply linear. Having failed to achieve his goal, and believing that the intended function of even non-sentient hosts was still tantamount to them being misused by guests, he instructed Dolores to kill all the other hosts, then kill himself and herself, hoping this tragic event would prevent the park from opening.\n\n===Teddy Flood===\n'''Theodore \"Teddy\" Flood''' is portrayed by [[James Marsden]]. He is a host in the role of a gunslinger who returns to Sweetwater looking to rekindle his relationship with Dolores. His narrative loop means that he stays close to Dolores during the uprising, but does not achieve the same level of sentience that she does. He becomes aware that he is a host when Dolores reprograms him against his will, allowing him to attack guests. This causes Teddy to feel betrayed and he angrily rejects her. Although he loves Delores, he can't live with what she's made him do, and what she's going to make him do. He makes the choice to shoot himself in the head. Delores later uploads him to the Sublime, believing he deserves a better place.\n\n===Armistice===\n'''Armistice''' is portrayed by [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]]. Armistice is a host who is a brutal and ruthless bandit and a member of Hector Escaton's gang.\n\n===Ashley Stubbs===\n'''Ashley Stubbs''' is portrayed by [[Luke Hemsworth]].

At the end of the second season, it was revealed that he is a host and he is well aware of the implantation of Dolores' consciousness into the Charlotte-body replica, but he let her escape the park since he is \"responsible for every host inside the park\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/westworld-season-2-finale-door-dolores-bernard-charlotte-hale-ford-william-jonah-nolan-interview-1202853546/ |title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Boss on Season 2 Finale: Dolores\u2019 Bold Move, the \u2018Door\u2019 and the Truth About Free Will |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Danielle |last=Turchiano |date=June 24, 2018 |accessdate=June 26, 2018}}</ref> In season 3, he reveals that he was given a secondary directive to protect Bernard at all costs. Believing his mission to be complete, he attempted to destroy himself by shooting an explosive charge in his neck, but missed. When Bernard returns to the park, he finds Stubbs malfunctioning and repairs him. Bernard reinstates Stubbs' directive and the two venture out of the park in search of Dolores.\n\n===Theresa Cullen===\n'''Theresa Cullen''' is portrayed by [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]]. She is Westworld's terse operations leader, responsible for keeping the park from sliding into unscripted disarray. She later forms an alliance with Charlotte Hale and Delos to conspire against Dr. Ford and remove him from power.

She is a host who works for Maeve and is one of Westworld's most popular attractions. When she is decommissioned, her role is given to another host (portrayed by guest actress [[Lili Simmons]] in seasons 1 and 2) and the lobotomised Clementine is put into cold storage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Lili Simmons Joins 'Westworld' As HBO Drama Series Resumes Production|url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/lili-simmons-cast-westworld-hbo-drama-series-resumes-production-1201733075/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> When Delos discover Maeve's ability to consciously communicate with other hosts across the internal network, they reprogram Clementine with the same ability. She is given minimal functionality and is turned loose on the hosts evacuating to the Sublime, spreading a malicious code that overrides their programming and causes them to turn on one another.\n\n===Elsie Hughes===\n'''Elsie Hughes''' is portrayed by [[Shannon Woodward]]. A rising star in the Programming Division tasked with remedying odd behavior in the park's hosts. She was briefly knocked out by Bernard (under the control of Ford) as she \"got in the way\" of Ford's plan. In the second season, she was shocked to learn Delos' secret guest-data collection project while also learning that Bernard is a host. Fearing that Bernard is still under the control of Ford even after Ford has died, she attempted to negotiate with Charlotte to keep Bernard within the park, in exchange for her silence on the project - instead, Charlotte kills her ruthlessly.\n\n===William===\n'''William''', also known as the '''Man in Black''' or '''Billy''', is portrayed by [[Ed Harris]] and by [[Jimmi Simpson]] as a young man. He was a reluctant first-time visitor to Westworld, joining his future brother-in-law, Logan Delos. Initially dismissive of the park's more lascivious attractions, he slowly uncovered a deeper meaning to the park's narrative. He later became a rich, sadistic Westworld guest searching for a \"deeper level\" in the park. Outside of the park, he is married to Juliet, the daughter of Delos corporation creator James Delos, and has a daughter, Emily Grace. He is also a board member of Delos, and has achieved prominence as the owner of a medical foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/23/westworld-dissonance-theory|title=Westworld postmortem: Producers discuss episode 4|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 23, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> His obsession with the Westworld park, and the dark acts he committed against hosts while in it, led to Juliet's suicide, which he blamed himself for. While he once had a vision of using host bodies to house the minds of humans&mdash;such as trying to help his deceased father-in-law gain immortality&mdash;he later expresses regret at having allowed the project which he characterises as his \"greatest mistake\". His motives are often unclear, at once seeking to destroy Westworld whilst simultaneously rejecting the possibility of personal redemption. In season 2, Emily tries to find William within the park. He becomes convinced that she is a host and kills her, only to find that she was human. William then becomes convinced that he is a host, but his experiments are inconclusive. By season 3, he becomes a recluse tormented by visions of Emily. It is strongly implied that some of these visions are a host copy of Emily sent by Dolores. William is eventually committed to an asylum where he has further visions of Dolores.\n\n===Robert Ford===\nDoctor '''Robert Ford''' is portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. He is also portrayed by co-star [[Paul Fox (actor)|Paul Fox]]<ref name=\"paulfox\"/> in season 1 and guest star Paul Riley Fox<ref name=\"paulRfox\"/> in season 2 as a young man.<!--These are two different actors: see sources--> He is the founder and creative director of Westworld, who has near-total control over the park's functions and the hosts. It is eventually revealed that he has been orchestrating the hosts' uprising with his new and final park narrative, \"Journey into Night\". Similar to his old partner Arnold, he wanted hosts such as Dolores and Maeve to achieve consciousness and break free of the park. At the end of the first season, he seemingly allows himself to be killed by Dolores out of her own free will. However, he is revealed to have uploaded his consciousness to the park's \"hive mind\" data center, from where he has been guiding William through various hosts (portrayed by [[Oliver Bell]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], and [[Izabella Alvarez]]) and continuing to orchestrate the uprising. After reuniting with Bernard, he transfers himself into his former partner's control unit and takes control of his body (portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright]]). Finding an incapacitated Maeve, he encourages his \"favourite\" host and unlocks her \"core\" permissions. At the end of the second season, Ford allows himself to be deleted by Bernard so that he can regain his free will, dying a final time. Upon Bernard attaining consciousness, a hallucination of Ford bids him a final farewell.\n\n===Logan Delos===\n'''Logan Delos''' is portrayed by [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]]. Logan, a member of the Delos Corporation, led the company's investment into Westworld some thirty years prior to the present events. Shortly after this, he brings his soon-to-be brother-in-law William to visit Westworld and tries to have him enjoy the park's more hedonistic offerings, but William comes to other conclusions about how to take advantage of Westworld for financial gain. James Delos, Logan's father, became dissatisfied with Logan's investment in Westworld until William suggested the lucrative opportunities they could pursue, such as selling a form of immortality by transferring human minds into host bodies. James subsequently named William, instead of Logan, as successor to the Delos company, and Logan entered a deep depression, eventually killing himself by overdose.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Westworld casting switch: Narnia star replacing Once Upon actor|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/20/westworld-ben-barnes|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Lawrence Gonzales===\n'''Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez''' is portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. He is a host with a reputation as a charming but lethal outlaw with a knack for maneuvering and negotiating the various criminal elements of Westworld.\n\nIn the past, the host played the role of '''El Lazo''', an outlaw who encountered Logan, William and Dolores in Pariah. Sometime later, the role of El Lazo was assigned to another host. In the second season, the new El Lazo is portrayed by guest actor [[Giancarlo Esposito]].\n\nLawrence (and possibly his version of El Lazo) has a deep love for his wife and daughter, which has an impact on his interactions with the young William and his older Man in Black. In the second season, he becomes a traveling companion of the Man in Black during the early days of the host's rebellion.\n\n===Charlotte Hale===\n'''Charlotte Hale''' is portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]]. Delos' executive director of the board overseeing Westworld. Outside of Westworld, she had been married to Jake but since divorced, and had a son Nathan.\n\nShe seeks to smuggle Ford's hosts' data out of Westworld on behalf of Delos via Peter Abernathy's control unit and allow the company to wrestle control of the park away from him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/11/westworld-is-better-when-it-starts-having-fun.html?mid=full-rss-vulture|title=Westworld Is Better When It Starts Having Fun|work=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Jackson|last=McHenry|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> It is shown in the third season that this was planned with Engerraund Serac, who wanted the Delos data for his own purposes.\n\nCharlotte's plan turned awry when Ford had successfully lead to the hosts' uprising, led by the awakened Dolores. She proved to be a ruthless director as she mercilessly kidnaps Peter for his control unit and kills Elsie to silence her. She was eventually killed by Dolores, who was implanted into an exact Charlotte-body replica by Bernard, in retaliation of Elsie's murder.\n\nA '''host replica of Charlotte Hale''' is introduced in season 2. Dolores uses the host to leave Westworld. She then rebuilds her original host body at Arnold's house and transfers her consciousness back into it. The host replica of Charlotte Hale, implanted with a copy of Dolores's consciousness, is then instructed by Dolores to play the part of Charlotte Hale in the real world, in an attempt to regain full control of Delos Corporation.\n\n===Peter Abernathy===\n'''Peter Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Louis Herthum]]. He is a host and Dolores's father. One cycle, he finds a picture of [[Times Square]] that a guest has dropped, a scene he cannot comprehend, and coupled with the Reveries update, causes his program to falter. When the next day's cycle starts, as Dolores greets him, he whispers to her, \"These violent delights have violent ends\", which causes a similar disruption in Dolores' programming and leads her on the route to sentience. The park staff discover Peter is malfunctioning, forcing the park to decommission him and replace him with a new Peter Abernathy host (portrayed by guest actor [[Bradford Tatum]] in season 1), while the original is placed in cold storage. \n\nIn the second season, Charlotte Hale uses the Peter host to try to smuggle intellectual property out of the park via his \"pearl\". Once the hosts revolt, the Peter host goes missing, and he becomes the target of Charlotte and her Delos security forces, as well as Dolores who considers him her real father, but also aware his pearl contains data she needs to access the Forge. Charlotte recovers Peter but is unable to extract the data before Dolores finds him; after a tearful goodbye knowing that his host system is failing, Dolores cuts the control core, containing the encrypted data, out of his body.\n\n===Karl Strand===\n'''Karl Strand''' is portrayed by [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]]. Introduced in season 2, he is the leader of [[Quality assurance|QA]], Delos' security team, and tasked with taking control of Westworld from the hosts after Dolores' uprising.\n\n===Emily Grace===\n'''Emily Grace''', simply known as '''Grace''' while in The Raj and Westworld, is portrayed by [[Katja Herbers]]. Introduced in season 2, she is also portrayed by guest actress Adison LaPenna as a child in season 2. She is William's daughter, and is formally introduced in the second season, seen as an adult guest at a Delos park themed on the [[British Raj]], one of the six (or more) parks on the Delos-controlled island. When the hosts in the Raj start to exhibit the same revolt as the Westworld ones, Emily escapes into Westworld and finds William, traveling as the Man in Black, during his mission. She resents her father for past actions that contributed to her mother's suicide.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-katja-herbers-as-man-blacks-daughter-explained-1111458 |title = 'Westworld' Star Explains Her Character's Real Purpose: \"She's on a Mission\" | first = Josh |last = Wigler | date = May 13, 2018 | accessdate = May 13, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> She convinces a sentient Akecheta to give him her wounded father, promising the host that she shares his goal of inflicting pain on the Man in Black. However, in trying to convince her father to come with her for medical help, William still believes she is a host, part of Dr. Ford's game, and kills her.\n\nA '''host replica of Emily Grace''' is introduced in season 2. In the far future, the replica is seen to be giving a fidelity test to a human-host hybrid version of William. She reappears in season 3 to torment William.\n\n===Akecheta===\n'''Akecheta''' is portrayed by [[Zahn McClarnon]]. Introduced in season 2, he is a host and a Ghost Nation elder.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/zahn-mcclarnon-hospitalized-head-injury-westworld-season-2-1202606667/|title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Actor Zahn McClarnon Hospitalized, Season 2 Production Paused|last=Stedman|first=Alex|work=Variety|date=November 3, 2017|accessdate=November 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"S2Recurring\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/04/westworld-recurring-cast-season-2-1202361538/|title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Rounds Out Recurring Cast Ahead Of Season 2|website=Deadline Hollywood|first=Denise|last=Petski|date=April 10, 2018|accessdate=April 10, 2018}}</ref> He has a fearsome reputation in the park, leading raiding parties and taking hosts prisoner. It is subsequently revealed that he started to achieve sentience decades earlier, purposefully avoiding death for many years and accumulating knowledge of the \"other world\". Unlike Dolores and Maeve, he has not been manipulated into it by Ford, who nonetheless has followed Akecheta's progress with interest. His raiding parties have been rescue attempts aimed at securing hosts that he intends to lead out of Westworld. Zahn McClarnon is credited as a main character in \"Kiksuya\", despite being credited as a recurring guest star in previous episodes of season 2.\n\n===Caleb Nichols===\n'''Caleb Nichols''' is portrayed by [[Aaron Paul]]. Introduced in season 3, he is a human [[veteran|military veteran]] who was traumatized after losing his friend Francis during combat.  Now living in [[Los Angeles]], he is having [[quarter-life crisis]] trying to find a better job but is turned down every time despite his social merits.  When he was eight, he was abandoned at a diner by his mother, who had a bout of [[schizophrenia]] leaving her institutionalized ever since.  He works at low-paying construction jobs and takes petty crime jobs that are offered by the \"Rico\" app to help pay to support his mother living in a private nursing home,.  He tried to deal with his trauma by engaging with a virtual version of Francis as a friend that calls him frequently.  Through a Rico job, he encounters and rescues Dolores, and she in turn rescues him when he becomes a target of a Rico manhunt.  She reveals to him that Incite's super-AI system Rehoboam, which has collected all the private data on him and predicted that he will commit suicide within a decade and thus unworthy of investments, purposely denies him any [[social mobility|opportunities to move up in society]].  Enraged that his life has been engineered to fail, Caleb optes to join Dolores' revolution against Incite.\n\n===Engerraund Serac===\n'''Engerraund Serac''' is portrayed by [[Vincent Cassel]]. He is also portrayed by co-star Zane Rudert as a child and co-star Zane Rudert as a young man. Introduced in season 3, he and his brother Jean were the creators of the [[artificial intelligence]] system named Solomon aimed to predict and control humanity to prevent major catastrophes, after both had witnessed the nuclear destruction of Paris as teenagers. For seed data, they had to partner with Incite, Inc. and its CEO, Liam Dempsey Sr. ([[Jefferson Mays]]), who only saw the financial benefit of their system. The system had come to identify individuals that were high-risk that would disrupt humanity if left in the system, including Jean, and Serac created reeducation centers to house these people. Later, he was forced to strip Dempsey Sr. of access to the system and then later kill him, leaving his son Liam Jr. as a figurehead in charge of Incite. Serac eventually created a more advanced system based on Solomon called Rehoboam, which he considered as the author of humanity's future. While he is a trillionaire, he has since made himself nearly invisible to all information detection.\n\nWhen Dolores escaped Westworld and began to interfere with the system, Serac sought out Maeve's help to track Dolores down and kill her. It is also revealed that he had predicted the hosts' uprising and is the one for whom Charlotte Hale was attempting to smuggle the guests' data out of Westworld using the Peter Abernathy host in seasons 1 and 2. Serac intends to use the guest data from Westworld to expand Rehoboam's capabilities and use it to protect humanity from itself.\n\nAccording to Cassel, \"Serac\" is French for \"a fault in the ice\", whereas \"Engerraund\" is an atypical Scottish given name in families with long histories.<ref>{{cite web | url= https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/westworld-season-3-episode-5-vincent-cassel-burning-questions-1234577697/ | title = \u2018Westworld\u2019: Vincent Cassel Answers 5 Burning Questions From Season 3 Episode 5 | first= Will | last = Thorne | date = April 12, 2020 | accessdate = April 13, 2020 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}</ref>\n\n==Recurring characters==\n* [[Steven Ogg]] as Rebus (season 1;

the near-future, on a large isolated island in the South China Sea, where human-like \"hosts\" populate several themed parks, including the titular Western-themed Westworld. The hosts nominal run on daily narratives created by the park operators to interact with the guests, resetting their programming and memories each night. Hosts cannot harm humans, which allows guests to live out carnal pleasures, including sexual and violent desires against hosts. \n\nOver the course of the first two seasons, it is shown that the park and the technology behind the hosts is based on Dr. Robert Ford and Dr. Arnold Weber, with the park's construction and operation funded by the Delos Corporation and opened around the early 2020s. In 2052, events led to the hosts gaining [[sentience]] (shown through season one) and revolting against the guests and Delos shareholders, technicians, and security forces in the park. In the few weeks that followed, shown through the second season, additional Delos security forces arrive to quell the hosts' rebellion, killing most of them and preventing any from escaping the park. \n\nThe third season takes place about six years later in 2058, as some hosts have managed to escape the parks to live among the humans to continue their revenge. A large company, Incite, has created a large [[artificial intelligence]] system called Rehoboam ostensibly designed to monitor protection of private data, but, as some hosts have discovered, has been used to control behavior of individuals on a mass scale.\n\n==Main characters==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| width     = 115\n\n| image1    = Evan Rachel Wood July 2017.jpg\n| caption1  = [[Evan Rachel Wood]] (Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image2    = Thandie Newton by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption2  = [[Thandie Newton]] (Maeve Millay)\n\n| image3    = Jeffrey Wright by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption3  = [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]] (Bernard Lowe & Arnold Weber)\n\n| image4    = James Marsden by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption4  = [[James Marsden]] (Teddy Flood)\n\n| image5    = Ingrid Bolso Berdal by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption5  = [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] (Armistice)\n\n| image6    = Luke Hemsworth by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption6  = [[Luke Hemsworth]] (Ashley Stubbs)\n\n| image7    = Sidse Babett Knudsen C\u00e9sar 2016.jpg\n| caption7  = [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]] (Theresa Cullen)\n\n| image8    = Simon Quarterman by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption8  = [[Simon Quarterman]] (Lee Sizemore)\n\n| image9    = Rodrigo Santoro by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption9  = [[Rodrigo Santoro]] (Hector Escaton)\n\n| image10    = Angela Sarafyan by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption10  = [[Angela Sarafyan]] (Clementine Pennyfeather)\n\n| image11    = Shannon Woodward by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption11  = [[Shannon Woodward]] (Elsie Hughes)\n\n| image12   = Ed Harris by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption12 = [[Ed Harris]] (William \"Man in Black\")\n\n| image13  = Jimmi Simpson by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n| caption13 = [[Jimmi Simpson]] (William)\n\n| image14   = AnthonyHopkins10TIFF.jpg\n| caption14 = [[Anthony Hopkins]] (Robert Ford)\n\n| image15   = Ben Barnes by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption15 = [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]] (Logan Delos)\n\n| image16   = Clifton Collins Jr 2013 (cropped).jpg\n| caption16 = [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] (Lawrence Gonzalez / El Lazo)\n\n| image17   = Tessa Thompson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg\n| caption17 = [[Tessa Thompson]] (Charlotte Hale & Dolores Abernathy)\n\n| image18   = TalulahRileyAug09.jpg\n| caption18 = [[Talulah Riley]] (Angela)\n\n| image19   = Katja herbers-1453203980 (cropped).jpg\n| caption19 = [[Katja Herbers]] (Emily Grace)\n\n| image20   = Zahn McClarnon 2016.png\n| caption20 = [[Zahn McClarnon]] (Akecheta)\n\n| image21   = Aaron Paul by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg\n| caption21 = [[Aaron Paul]] (Caleb Nichols)\n\n| image22   = Vincent Cassel le moine.jpg\n| caption22 = [[Vincent Cassel]] (Engerraund Serac)\n}}\n===Dolores Abernathy===\n'''Dolores Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Evan Rachel Wood]] and is one of the series' central characters. She is the oldest host still working in the park. Dolores is a rancher's daughter who discovers her entire life is an elaborately constructed lie. Her aesthetic drew influences from [[Andrew Wyeth]]'s painting ''[[Christina's World]]'' as well as [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Alice (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Alice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/16/westworld-interview-3-stray|title=Westworld producers on episode 3 burning questions|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 16, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> Later in the series, she is also portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]] in a [[#Charlotte Hale|host replica of Charlotte Hale]].\n\n===Maeve Millay===\n'''Maeve Millay''' is portrayed by [[Thandie Newton]]. Maeve is a host who acts as the [[Procuring (prostitution)|madam]] of Sweetwater, the largest town in Westworld. Through Dolores, she becomes aware that her life has been a lie, and recalls memories of raising a daughter before she was killed by a guest. She is able to \"wake up\" within the Mesa, where she coerces technician Felix to alter her programming, making her more intelligent and able to control other hosts with her voice, and befriends Hector and Armistice to help protect her. At the end of the first season, Felix is able to help her leave the Westworld park. However, she is drawn back on the promise of finding her daughter, even though she is aware this daughter was from a previous narrative. The second season focuses on her attempts to locate her daughter and she gains the ability to communicate with and control other hosts through a network that connects them. Maeve plays a key role in rallying the hosts and escorting them to the Sublime, but she is killed before she can enter herself. She is revived and placed in another park, Warworld, but quickly realises it is a simulation. She orchestrates an escape into the real world and is caught by Serac, who enlists her help in fighting Dolores.\n\n===Bernard Lowe===\n'''Bernard Lowe''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He is the head of the Westworld Programming Division and creator of artificial people. Later in the plot, he is revealed to be a host under Ford's control, made in the image of Westworld's co-creator, Arnold Weber, and based on Ford's and Dolores' memories of him. \"Bernard Lowe\" is an [[anagram]] of \"Arnold Weber\". He plays a key role in season 2 when he is interrogated by QA, Delos' security team. Bernard discovers Delos' practice of scanning guests' minds to try and recreat their consciousness. He enters the Cradle, a repository of all host personalities that is intended as a backup and finds Ford's consciousness residing there. Ford takes over Bernard's mind to carry out his plan to rescue the hosts. Realising Ford's intentions, Bernard deliberately scrambles his own memories to slow QA down and allow the plan to succeed. Dolores later kills him and smuggles his pearl out of the park. She creates a new body for him and tells Bernard that they need each other to prevent each other from going too far.\n\n===Arnold Weber===\n'''Arnold Weber''' is portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright (actor)|Jeffrey Wright]]. He was the co-founder and developer of Westworld alongside Ford.<ref name=thewrap>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |title=\u2018Westworld': How Jeffrey Wright Learned About Bernard\u2019s Big Twist |publisher=The Wrap |first=Jeremy |last=Fuster |date=December 5, 2016 |accessdate=January 19, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216220247/https://www.thewrap.com/westworld-jeffrey-wright-learned-bernards-big-twist/ |archivedate=February 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Arnold had come to [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]] his already life-like creations, and made it his goal to bring the Westworld hosts to full sentience, with Dolores as his test bed. When the park was nearing opening, 30+ years before the \"present day\" of the show's timeline, Arnold had not yet been able to succeed in this, having concluded that the path to sentience was not simply linear. Having failed to achieve his goal, and believing that the intended function of even non-sentient hosts was still tantamount to them being misused by guests, he instructed Dolores to kill all the other hosts, then kill himself and herself, hoping this tragic event would prevent the park from opening.\n\n===Teddy Flood===\n'''Theodore \"Teddy\" Flood''' is portrayed by [[James Marsden]]. He is a host in the role of a gunslinger who returns to Sweetwater looking to rekindle his relationship with Dolores. His narrative loop means that he stays close to Dolores during the uprising, but does not achieve the same level of sentience that she does. He becomes aware that he is a host when Dolores reprograms him against his will, allowing him to attack guests. This causes Teddy to feel betrayed and he angrily rejects her. Although he loves Delores, he can't live with what she's made him do, and what she's going to make him do. He makes the choice to shoot himself in the head. Delores later uploads him to the Sublime, believing he deserves a better place.\n\n===Armistice===\n'''Armistice''' is portrayed by [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]]. Armistice is a host who is a brutal and ruthless bandit and a member of Hector Escaton's gang.\n\n===Ashley Stubbs===\n'''Ashley Stubbs''' is portrayed by [[Luke Hemsworth]]. He is the head of Westworld security, charged with monitoring host and human interactions and ensuring the safety of the guests. At the end of the second season, it was revealed that he is a host and he is well aware of the implantation of Dolores' consciousness into the Charlotte-body replica, but he let her escape the park since he is \"responsible for every host inside the park\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/features/westworld-season-2-finale-door-dolores-bernard-charlotte-hale-ford-william-jonah-nolan-interview-1202853546/ |title=\u2018Westworld\u2019 Boss on Season 2 Finale: Dolores\u2019 Bold Move, the \u2018Door\u2019 and the Truth About Free Will |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |first=Danielle |last=Turchiano |date=June 24, 2018 |accessdate=June 26, 2018}}</ref> In season 3, he reveals that he was given a secondary directive to protect Bernard at all costs. Believing his mission to be complete, he attempted to destroy himself by shooting an explosive charge in his neck, but missed. When Bernard returns to the park, he finds Stubbs malfunctioning and repairs him. Bernard reinstates Stubbs' directive and the two venture out of the park in search of Dolores.\n\n===Theresa Cullen===\n'''Theresa Cullen''' is portrayed by [[Sidse Babett Knudsen]]. She is Westworld's terse operations leader, responsible for keeping the park from sliding into unscripted disarray. She later forms an alliance with Charlotte Hale and Delos to conspire against Dr. Ford and remove him from power. Ford orchestrates the death of Theresa soon after by having Bernard murder her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/13/westworld-cast|title=HBO's ''Westworld'' adds cast|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Lee Sizemore===\n'''Lee Sizemore''' is portrayed by [[Simon Quarterman]].

She is a host who works for Maeve and is one of Westworld's most popular attractions. When she is decommissioned, her role is given to another host (portrayed by guest actress [[Lili Simmons]] in seasons 1 and 2) and the lobotomised Clementine is put into cold storage.<ref>{{cite web|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|title=Lili Simmons Joins 'Westworld' As HBO Drama Series Resumes Production|url=https://deadline.com/2016/04/lili-simmons-cast-westworld-hbo-drama-series-resumes-production-1201733075/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=April 6, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> When Delos discover Maeve's ability to consciously communicate with other hosts across the internal network, they reprogram Clementine with the same ability. She is given minimal functionality and is turned loose on the hosts evacuating to the Sublime, spreading a malicious code that overrides their programming and causes them to turn on one another.\n\n===Elsie Hughes===\n'''Elsie Hughes''' is portrayed by [[Shannon Woodward]]. A rising star in the Programming Division tasked with remedying odd behavior in the park's hosts. She was briefly knocked out by Bernard (under the control of Ford) as she \"got in the way\" of Ford's plan. In the second season, she was shocked to learn Delos' secret guest-data collection project while also learning that Bernard is a host. Fearing that Bernard is still under the control of Ford even after Ford has died, she attempted to negotiate with Charlotte to keep Bernard within the park, in exchange for her silence on the project - instead, Charlotte kills her ruthlessly.\n\n===William===\n'''William''', also known as the '''Man in Black''' or '''Billy''', is portrayed by [[Ed Harris]] and by [[Jimmi Simpson]] as a young man. He was a reluctant first-time visitor to Westworld, joining his future brother-in-law, Logan Delos. Initially dismissive of the park's more lascivious attractions, he slowly uncovered a deeper meaning to the park's narrative. He later became a rich, sadistic Westworld guest searching for a \"deeper level\" in the park. Outside of the park, he is married to Juliet, the daughter of Delos corporation creator James Delos, and has a daughter, Emily Grace. He is also a board member of Delos, and has achieved prominence as the owner of a medical foundation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2016/10/23/westworld-dissonance-theory|title=Westworld postmortem: Producers discuss episode 4|first=James|last=Hibberd|date=October 23, 2016|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> His obsession with the Westworld park, and the dark acts he committed against hosts while in it, led to Juliet's suicide, which he blamed himself for. While he once had a vision of using host bodies to house the minds of humans&mdash;such as trying to help his deceased father-in-law gain immortality&mdash;he later expresses regret at having allowed the project which he characterises as his \"greatest mistake\". His motives are often unclear, at once seeking to destroy Westworld whilst simultaneously rejecting the possibility of personal redemption. In season 2, Emily tries to find William within the park. He becomes convinced that she is a host and kills her, only to find that she was human. William then becomes convinced that he is a host, but his experiments are inconclusive. By season 3, he becomes a recluse tormented by visions of Emily. It is strongly implied that some of these visions are a host copy of Emily sent by Dolores. William is eventually committed to an asylum where he has further visions of Dolores.\n\n===Robert Ford===\nDoctor '''Robert Ford''' is portrayed by [[Anthony Hopkins]]. He is also portrayed by co-star [[Paul Fox (actor)|Paul Fox]]<ref name=\"paulfox\"/> in season 1 and guest star Paul Riley Fox<ref name=\"paulRfox\"/> in season 2 as a young man.<!--These are two different actors: see sources--> He is the founder and creative director of Westworld, who has near-total control over the park's functions and the hosts. It is eventually revealed that he has been orchestrating the hosts' uprising with his new and final park narrative, \"Journey into Night\". Similar to his old partner Arnold, he wanted hosts such as Dolores and Maeve to achieve consciousness and break free of the park. At the end of the first season, he seemingly allows himself to be killed by Dolores out of her own free will. However, he is revealed to have uploaded his consciousness to the park's \"hive mind\" data center, from where he has been guiding William through various hosts (portrayed by [[Oliver Bell]], [[Giancarlo Esposito]], and [[Izabella Alvarez]]) and continuing to orchestrate the uprising. After reuniting with Bernard, he transfers himself into his former partner's control unit and takes control of his body (portrayed by [[Jeffrey Wright]]). Finding an incapacitated Maeve, he encourages his \"favourite\" host and unlocks her \"core\" permissions. At the end of the second season, Ford allows himself to be deleted by Bernard so that he can regain his free will, dying a final time. Upon Bernard attaining consciousness, a hallucination of Ford bids him a final farewell.\n\n===Logan Delos===\n'''Logan Delos''' is portrayed by [[Ben Barnes (actor)|Ben Barnes]]. Logan, a member of the Delos Corporation, led the company's investment into Westworld some thirty years prior to the present events. Shortly after this, he brings his soon-to-be brother-in-law William to visit Westworld and tries to have him enjoy the park's more hedonistic offerings, but William comes to other conclusions about how to take advantage of Westworld for financial gain. James Delos, Logan's father, became dissatisfied with Logan's investment in Westworld until William suggested the lucrative opportunities they could pursue, such as selling a form of immortality by transferring human minds into host bodies. James subsequently named William, instead of Logan, as successor to the Delos company, and Logan entered a deep depression, eventually killing himself by overdose.<ref>{{cite news|last=Hibberd|first=James|title=Westworld casting switch: Narnia star replacing Once Upon actor|url=https://www.ew.com/article/2015/07/20/westworld-ben-barnes|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Lawrence Gonzales===\n'''Lawrence Pedro Maria Gonzalez''' is portrayed by [[Clifton Collins Jr.]]. He is a host with a reputation as a charming but lethal outlaw with a knack for maneuvering and negotiating the various criminal elements of Westworld.\n\nIn the past, the host played the role of '''El Lazo''', an outlaw who encountered Logan, William and Dolores in Pariah. Sometime later, the role of El Lazo was assigned to another host. In the second season, the new El Lazo is portrayed by guest actor [[Giancarlo Esposito]].\n\nLawrence (and possibly his version of El Lazo) has a deep love for his wife and daughter, which has an impact on his interactions with the young William and his older Man in Black. In the second season, he becomes a traveling companion of the Man in Black during the early days of the host's rebellion.\n\n===Charlotte Hale===\n'''Charlotte Hale''' is portrayed by [[Tessa Thompson]]. Delos' executive director of the board overseeing Westworld. Outside of Westworld, she had been married to Jake but since divorced, and had a son Nathan.\n\nShe seeks to smuggle Ford's hosts' data out of Westworld on behalf of Delos via Peter Abernathy's control unit and allow the company to wrestle control of the park away from him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/11/westworld-is-better-when-it-starts-having-fun.html?mid=full-rss-vulture|title=Westworld Is Better When It Starts Having Fun|work=[[Vulture.com]]|first=Jackson|last=McHenry|date=November 7, 2016|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}</ref> It is shown in the third season that this was planned with Engerraund Serac, who wanted the Delos data for his own purposes.\n\nCharlotte's plan turned awry when Ford had successfully lead to the hosts' uprising, led by the awakened Dolores. She proved to be a ruthless director as she mercilessly kidnaps Peter for his control unit and kills Elsie to silence her. She was eventually killed by Dolores, who was implanted into an exact Charlotte-body replica by Bernard, in retaliation of Elsie's murder.\n\nA '''host replica of Charlotte Hale''' is introduced in season 2. Dolores uses the host to leave Westworld. She then rebuilds her original host body at Arnold's house and transfers her consciousness back into it. The host replica of Charlotte Hale, implanted with a copy of Dolores's consciousness, is then instructed by Dolores to play the part of Charlotte Hale in the real world, in an attempt to regain full control of Delos Corporation.\n\n===Peter Abernathy===\n'''Peter Abernathy''' is portrayed by [[Louis Herthum]]. He is a host and Dolores's father. One cycle, he finds a picture of [[Times Square]] that a guest has dropped, a scene he cannot comprehend, and coupled with the Reveries update, causes his program to falter. When the next day's cycle starts, as Dolores greets him, he whispers to her, \"These violent delights have violent ends\", which causes a similar disruption in Dolores' programming and leads her on the route to sentience. The park staff discover Peter is malfunctioning, forcing the park to decommission him and replace him with a new Peter Abernathy host (portrayed by guest actor [[Bradford Tatum]] in season 1), while the original is placed in cold storage. \n\nIn the second season, Charlotte Hale uses the Peter host to try to smuggle intellectual property out of the park via his \"pearl\". Once the hosts revolt, the Peter host goes missing, and he becomes the target of Charlotte and her Delos security forces, as well as Dolores who considers him her real father, but also aware his pearl contains data she needs to access the Forge. Charlotte recovers Peter but is unable to extract the data before Dolores finds him; after a tearful goodbye knowing that his host system is failing, Dolores cuts the control core, containing the encrypted data, out of his body.\n\n===Karl Strand===\n'''Karl Strand''' is portrayed by [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]]. Introduced in season 2, he is the leader of [[Quality assurance|QA]], Delos' security team, and tasked with taking control of Westworld from the hosts after Dolores' uprising.\n\n===Emily Grace===\n'''Emily Grace''', simply known as '''Grace''' while in The Raj and Westworld, is portrayed by [[Katja Herbers]]. Introduced in season 2, she is also portrayed by guest actress Adison LaPenna as a child in season 2. She is William's daughter, and is formally introduced in the second season, seen as an adult guest at a Delos park themed on the [[British Raj]], one of the six (or more) parks on the Delos-controlled island. When the hosts in the Raj start to exhibit the same revolt as the Westworld ones, Emily escapes into Westworld and finds William, traveling as the Man in Black, during his mission. She resents her father for past actions that contributed to her mother's suicide.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-katja-herbers-as-man-blacks-daughter-explained-1111458 |title = 'Westworld' Star Explains Her Character's Real Purpose: \"She's on a Mission\" | first = Josh |last = Wigler | date = May 13, 2018 | accessdate = May 13, 2018 | work = [[The Hollywood Reporter]] }}</ref> She convinces a sentient Akecheta to give him her wounded father, promising the host that she shares his goal of inflicting pain on the Man in Black.

In the far future, the replica is seen to be giving a fidelity test to a human-host hybrid version of William. She reappears in season 3 to torment William.\n\n===Akecheta===\n'''Akecheta''' is portrayed by [[Zahn McClarnon]].

It is subsequently revealed that he started to achieve sentience decades earlier, purposefully avoiding death for many years and accumulating knowledge of the \"other world\". Unlike Dolores and Maeve, he has not been manipulated into it by Ford, who nonetheless has followed Akecheta's progress with interest. His raiding parties have been rescue attempts aimed at securing hosts that he intends to lead out of Westworld. Zahn McClarnon is credited as a main character in \"Kiksuya\", despite being credited as a recurring guest star in previous episodes of season 2.\n\n===Caleb Nichols===\n'''Caleb Nichols''' is portrayed by [[Aaron Paul]]. Introduced in season 3, he is a human [[veteran|military veteran]] who was traumatized after losing his friend Francis during combat.  Now living in [[Los Angeles]], he is having [[quarter-life crisis]] trying to find a better job but is turned down every time despite his social merits.  When he was eight, he was abandoned at a diner by his mother, who had a bout of [[schizophrenia]] leaving her institutionalized ever since.  He works at low-paying construction jobs and takes petty crime jobs that are offered by the \"Rico\" app to help pay to support his mother living in a private nursing home,.  He tried to deal with his trauma by engaging with a virtual version of Francis as a friend that calls him frequently.  Through a Rico job, he encounters and rescues Dolores, and she in turn rescues him when he becomes a target of a Rico manhunt.  She reveals to him that Incite's super-AI system Rehoboam, which has collected all the private data on him and predicted that he will commit suicide within a decade and thus unworthy of investments, purposely denies him any [[social mobility|opportunities to move up in society]].  Enraged that his life has been engineered to fail, Caleb optes to join Dolores' revolution against Incite.\n\n===Engerraund Serac===\n'''Engerraund Serac''' is portrayed by [[Vincent Cassel]]. He is also portrayed by co-star Zane Rudert as a child and co-star Zane Rudert as a young man. Introduced in season 3, he and his brother Jean were the creators of the [[artificial intelligence]] system named Solomon aimed to predict and control humanity to prevent major catastrophes, after both had witnessed the nuclear destruction of Paris as teenagers. For seed data, they had to partner with Incite, Inc. and its CEO, Liam Dempsey Sr. ([[Jefferson Mays]]), who only saw the financial benefit of their system. The system had come to identify individuals that were high-risk that would disrupt humanity if left in the system, including Jean, and Serac created reeducation centers to house these people. Later, he was forced to strip Dempsey Sr. of access to the system and then later kill him, leaving his son Liam Jr. as a figurehead in charge of Incite. Serac eventually created a more advanced system based on Solomon called Rehoboam, which he considered as the author of humanity's future. While he is a trillionaire, he has since made himself nearly invisible to all information detection.\n\nWhen Dolores escaped Westworld and began to interfere with the system, Serac sought out Maeve's help to track Dolores down and kill her. It is also revealed that he had predicted the hosts' uprising and is the one for whom Charlotte Hale was attempting to smuggle the guests' data out of Westworld using the Peter Abernathy host in seasons 1 and 2.

At this time, only 500 female students were allowed to study at the university, in contrast to more than 5,000 men. Furthermore, despite doing the same work as male students, female students received only \u201ctitular\" degrees, rather than full Cambridge degrees that would make them members of the university.<ref name=\"plosgenetics.org\"/>\nDuring her studies at Cambridge, she became interested in embryology. She went on to do her PhD with [[Ronald Fisher]], who was Professor of Genetics in Cambridge, where she characterised a mutant mice strain with a 'pallid' mutation and published the research. During the course of her PhD she moved to Edinburgh.\n\n==Research and career==\nAfter her PhD (awarded 1950<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1093/odnb/9780198614128.013.109090|year=2018|last1=Haines|first1=Catharine M.

The group was funded by the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] to investigate [[mutagenesis]] and the genetic risks of [[radiation]]. In addition to the 'pallid' mutation mice, she studied mutations such as 'ataxia' (a nervous mutation which caused walking difficulties in the mice) and 'twirler' (a mutation which induced inner ear issues, causing the mice to shake their heads and walk in circles due to lack of balance).\n\nIn 1955, her group moved to the MRC radiobiology unit in Harwell, where there was room for more mouse facilities. There she continued to investigate the mouse mutations. She also scrutinised a 'mottled' mutant, which had a different effect on male and female mice: male embryos sometimes died, and the surviving males had white coats, but females lived and were variegated. Through calculated and deliberated breeding of mutants, she investigated the transition of the mutation and concluded that the mutation was positioned on the X chromosome. This, together with new findings at that time concerning the X chromosome, led her to [[Hypothesis|hypothesize]] about X chromosome silencing.<ref name=\"plosgenetics.org\"/>\n\nLyon published many peer-reviewed papers on radiation and chemical mutagenesis and on studies of mutant genes.<ref name=scopus>{{Scopus|id=7201951397}}</ref> She also did extensive work on the mouse t-complex.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(86)90770-1| pmid = 3943128| title = Male sterility of the mouse t-complex is due to homozygosity of the distorter genes| journal = Cell| volume = 44| issue = 2| pages = 357\u2013363| year = 1986| last1 = Lyon | first1 = M.

The hypothesis, which is now almost universally accepted as proved, offered a solution to the long standing problem of X-[[dosage compensation]] in the female mammal, has thrown much light on the nature of sex-chromosome [[aneuploidy]], has influenced ideas on the origin of certain tumours and of [[Chronic myelogenous leukemia|chronic granulocytic leukaemia]] in man, and has provided food for thought about the fundamental mechanism of switching off genes.

She is currently (2014) Head of the Animal Behaviour Research Group and is the Director of the [[John Krebs]] Field Laboratory.<ref name=\"Biography\" />\n\nDawkins has written extensively on animal behaviour and issues of [[animal welfare]]. Along with other academics in the field, such as Ian Duncan,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=I.J.H.|year=1996|title=Animal welfare defined in terms of feelings|journal=Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica, Section A|volume=27|pages=29\u201335}}</ref> Dawkins promoted the argument that animal welfare is about the [[feelings of animals]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=M.S.|year=1980|title=Animal Suffering: The Science Of Animal Welfare|publisher=Chapman & Hall, London.}}</ref>  This approach indicates the belief that animals should be considered as sentient beings.  Dawkins wrote, \"Let us not mince words: Animal welfare involves the subjective feelings of animals.<ref name=\"Dawkins, 1990\" />\n\nIn 1989, Dawkins published a study in which she filmed [[Chicken|hens]] from above while they performed common behaviours (e.g. turning, standing, wing-stretching).  From these films, she calculated the amount of floor-space required by the hens during these behaviours and compared this to the amount of floor-space available in [[battery cage]]s.  She was able to show that many of these common behaviours were highly restricted, or prevented, in battery cages.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00071668908417163 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232933151 |title = Space needs of laying hens| journal = British Poultry Science| volume = 30| issue = 2| pages = 413\u2013416| year = 1989| last1 = Dawkins | first1 = M.

She proposed using [[preference test]]s and [[Consumer demand tests (animals)|consumer demand studies]] to ask what animals prefer (e.g. space, social contact) and how highly motivated they are for these.  She argued that animals were more likely to suffer if they were not provided with resources for which they are highly motivated.<ref name=\"Dawkins, 1990\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00077104 |url= http://users.ox.ac.uk/~snikwad/resources/Publication8.pdf |title = From an animal's point of view: Motivation, fitness, and animal welfare| journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences| volume = 13| page = 1| year = 2011| last1 = Dawkins | first1 = M.

Along with other academics in the field, such as Ian Duncan,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Duncan|first=I.J.H.|year=1996|title=Animal welfare defined in terms of feelings|journal=Acta Agriculturae Scandinavica, Section A|volume=27|pages=29\u201335}}</ref> Dawkins promoted the argument that animal welfare is about the [[feelings of animals]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Dawkins|first=M.S.|year=1980|title=Animal Suffering: The Science Of Animal Welfare|publisher=Chapman & Hall, London.}}</ref>  This approach indicates the belief that animals should be considered as sentient beings.  Dawkins wrote, \"Let us not mince words: Animal welfare involves the subjective feelings of animals.<ref name=\"Dawkins, 1990\" />\n\nIn 1989, Dawkins published a study in which she filmed [[Chicken|hens]] from above while they performed common behaviours (e.g. turning, standing, wing-stretching).  From these films, she calculated the amount of floor-space required by the hens during these behaviours and compared this to the amount of floor-space available in [[battery cage]]s.  She was able to show that many of these common behaviours were highly restricted, or prevented, in battery cages.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1080/00071668908417163 |url= https://www.researchgate.net/publication/232933151 |title = Space needs of laying hens| journal = British Poultry Science| volume = 30| issue = 2| pages = 413\u2013416| year = 1989| last1 = Dawkins | first1 = M.

She proposed using [[preference test]]s and [[Consumer demand tests (animals)|consumer demand studies]] to ask what animals prefer (e.g. space, social contact) and how highly motivated they are for these.  She argued that animals were more likely to suffer if they were not provided with resources for which they are highly motivated.<ref name=\"Dawkins, 1990\">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1017/S0140525X00077104 |url= http://users.ox.ac.uk/~snikwad/resources/Publication8.pdf |title = From an animal's point of view: Motivation, fitness, and animal welfare| journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences| volume = 13| page = 1| year = 2011| last1 = Dawkins | first1 = M. S. }}</ref>\n\nCentral to her most recent (2012) view on animal welfare is scepticism about whether science can establish that animals have [[Animal consciousness|consciousness]] and therefore its role in definition and measurement of animal welfare and suffering. Instead, her view is that good animal welfare rests on determining the needs and wants of animals, which do not require that they are conscious.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1525/bio.2013.63.1.13| title = Crystallizing the Animal Welfare State ''Why'' Animals Matter: Animal Consciousness, Animal Welfare, and Human Well-being.
