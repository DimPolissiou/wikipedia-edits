Of the hundreds of [[aularian]] houses that sprang up across the city, only [[St Edmund Hall]] (c. 1225) remains. What put an end to the halls was the emergence of colleges. [[Colleges of the University of Oxford#History|Oxford's earliest colleges]] were [[University College, Oxford|University College]] (1249), [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] (1263) and [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]] (1264). These colleges were established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology, inspiring scientific discoveries and advancements in the arts, as society began to see itself in a new way. These colleges at Oxford were supported by the Church in the hope of reconciling [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]]. The relationship between \"[[town and gown]]\" has often been uneasy \u2013 as many as 93 students and townspeople were killed in the [[St. Scholastica riot|St Scholastica Day Riot]] of 1355.\n\nThe [[sweating sickness]] epidemic in 1517 was particularly devastating to Oxford and [[Cambridge]] where it killed half of both cities' populations, including many students and dons.<ref>[http://www.storyoflondon.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=244&mode=thread&order=0&thold=0 \"The Sweating Sickness\"].

Another reminder of the ongoing war was found in the influx of wounded and disabled soldiers, who were treated in new hospitals housed in buildings such as the university's Examination School, the [[Oxford Town Hall|town hall]] and [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = History of the University of Oxford: Volume VIII: The Twentieth Century \u2013 Oxford Scholarship|url = http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001/acprof-9780198229742|doi = 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001|access-date = 10 November 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117073638/http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198229742.001.0001/acprof-9780198229742|archive-date = 17 November 2015|url-status = live|year = 1994|isbn = 9780198229742|publisher = Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 20th century, there was rapid industrial and population growth, with the printing and publishing industries becoming well established by the 1920s. In 1929 the boundaries of the city were extended to include the suburbs of [[Headington]], [[Cowley, Oxford|Cowley]] and [[Iffley]] to the east, and [[Wolvercote]] to the north.<ref name=boundaries/>\n\nAlso during the 1920s, the economy and society of Oxford underwent a huge transformation as [[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|William Morris]] established [[Morris Motors|Morris Motors Limited]] to mass-produce cars in Cowley, on the south-eastern edge of the city. By the early 1970s over 20,000 people worked in Cowley at the huge Morris Motors and [[Pressed Steel Fisher]] plants. Oxford was now a city of two halves: the university city to the west of [[Magdalen Bridge]] and the car town to the east. This led to the witticism that \"Oxford is the left bank of Cowley\". Cowley suffered major job losses in the 1980s and 1990s during the decline of [[British Leyland]], but is now producing the successful [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] for [[BMW]] on a smaller site. Much of the original car factories at Cowley was demolished in the 1990s, and is now the site of the [[Oxford Business Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.library.hbs.edu/go/oxfordbg.html|title=Oxford Business Group Country Reports|work=hbs.edu|access-date=25 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120730091137/http://www.library.hbs.edu/go/oxfordbg.html|archive-date=30 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Oxford was largely ignored by the German air raids during the [[The Blitz|Blitz]], perhaps due to the lack of heavy industry such as steelworks or shipbuilding that would have made it a target, although it was still affected by the rationing and influx of refugees fleeing London and other cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/120111_1.html|title=Exhibition remembers refugees who fled to Oxford before and during World War II|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021091922/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/120111_1.html|archivedate=21 October 2012}}</ref> The university's colleges served as temporary military barracks and training areas for soldiers before deployment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/345/brasenose-college-archives-and-history-38/college-life-214/college-life-in-wartime-421.html|title=College life in wartime|author=Neil Harvey|work=ox.ac.uk|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515114548/http://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/345/brasenose-college-archives-and-history-38/college-life-214/college-life-in-wartime-421.html|archivedate=15 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn 6 May 1954, [[Roger Bannister]], a 25-year-old medical student, ran the first authenticated sub-[[four-minute mile]] at the [[Iffley Road]] running track in Oxford.

These colleges were established at a time when Europeans were starting to translate the writings of Greek philosophers. These writings challenged European ideology, inspiring scientific discoveries and advancements in the arts, as society began to see itself in a new way. These colleges at Oxford were supported by the Church in the hope of reconciling [[Greek philosophy]] and [[Christian theology]].

By the early 1970s over 20,000 people worked in Cowley at the huge Morris Motors and [[Pressed Steel Fisher]] plants. Oxford was now a city of two halves: the university city to the west of [[Magdalen Bridge]] and the car town to the east. This led to the witticism that \"Oxford is the left bank of Cowley\". Cowley suffered major job losses in the 1980s and 1990s during the decline of [[British Leyland]], but is now producing the successful [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] for [[BMW]] on a smaller site.

The principal production site for [[Mini (marque)|Mini]] cars, owned by [[BMW]] since 2000, is in the Oxford suburb of [[Cowley, Oxfordshire|Cowley]]. The plant, which survived the threat of closure in the early 1990s, also produced cars under the [[Austin Motor Company|Austin]] and [[Rover Group|Rover]] brands following the demise of the Morris brand in 1984, although the last Morris-badged car was produced there in 1982.\n\n===Publishing===\n[[Oxford University Press]], a department of the University of Oxford, is based in the city, although it no longer operates its own paper mill and printing house. The city is also home to the UK operations of [[Wiley-Blackwell]], [[Elsevier]] and several smaller publishing houses.\n\n===Science and technology===\nThe presence of the university has given rise to many science and technology based businesses, including [[Oxford Instruments]], [[Research Machines]] and [[Sophos]]. The university established [[Isis Innovation]] in 1987 to promote technology transfer. The [[Oxford Science Park]] was established in 1990, and the [[Begbroke Science Park]], owned by the university, lies north of the city.\n\nOxford increasingly has a reputation for being a centre of digital innovation, as epitomized by Digital Oxford.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Home \u2013 Digital Oxford|url = http://digitaloxford.com/|website = Digital Oxford|accessdate = 3 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150509055659/http://digitaloxford.com/|archive-date = 9 May 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> Several startups including Passle,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Passle \u2013 become a thought leader|url = http://passle.net|website = Passle: Don't have time to blog?|accessdate = 3 June 2015}}</ref> Brainomix,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Brainomix|url = https://www.brainomix.com/|website = Brainomix|accessdate = 5 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150708091626/https://www.brainomix.com/|archive-date = 8 July 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> [[Labstep]],<ref>{{Cite web|title = Labstep|url = https://angel.co/labstep|website = angel.co|accessdate = 3 June 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150603230831/https://angel.co/labstep|archive-date = 3 June 2015|url-status = live}}</ref> and more, are based in Oxford.\n\n===Education===\nThe presence of the university has also led to Oxford becoming a centre for the education industry.

Several of the colleges had private breweries, one of which, at [[Brasenose College, Oxford|Brasenose]], survived until 1889. In the 16th century brewing and malting appear to have been the most popular trades in the city. There were breweries in [[Brewer Street, Oxford|Brewer Street]] and [[Paradise Street, Oxford|Paradise Street]], near the [[Castle Mill Stream]].\n\nThe rapid expansion of Oxford and the development of its railway links after the 1840s facilitated expansion of the brewing trade.<ref name=Woolley78>{{cite journal |last1=Woolley |first1=Liz |year=2010 |title=Industrial Architecture in Oxford, 1870 to 1914 |journal=Oxoniensia |volume=LXXV |page=78 |publisher=[[Oxfordshire Architectural and Historical Society]] |issn=0308-5562}}</ref> As well as expanding the market for Oxford's brewers, railways enabled brewers further from the city to compete for a share of its market.<ref name=Woolley78/> By 1874 there were nine breweries in Oxford and 13 brewers' agents in Oxford shipping beer in from elsewhere.<ref name=Woolley78/> The nine breweries were: Flowers & Co in [[Cowley Road]], Hall's St Giles Brewery, Hall's Swan Brewery (see below), Hanley's City Brewery in [[Queen Street, Oxford|Queen Street]], Le Mills's Brewery in [[St. Ebbes]], [[Morrells Brewing Company|Morrell's]] Lion Brewery in [[St Thomas', Oxford|St Thomas Street]] (see below), Simonds's Brewery in Queen Street, Weaving's Eagle Brewery (by 1869 the Eagle Steam Brewery) in [[Park End Street]] and Wootten and Cole's [[St Clement's, Oxford|St. Clement's]] Brewery.<ref name=Woolley78/>\n\nThe Swan's Nest Brewery, later the Swan Brewery, was established by the early 18th century in Paradise Street, and in 1795 was acquired by William Hall.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Page |editor-first=William |editor-link=William Page (historian) |series=Victoria County History |title=A History of the County of Oxford, Volume 2: Industries: Malting and Brewing |year=1907 |publisher=[[Archibald Constable]] & Co |pages=225\u2013277 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101945#s12 |access-date=5 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316074332/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=101945#s12 |archive-date=16 March 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The brewery became known as Hall's Oxford Brewery, which acquired other local breweries.

Rubens]] and [[Cecil Raleigh]], lyrics and music by Rubens and additional lyrics by [[Arthur Wimperis]].  The story involves a working girl who falls in love with the heir to the factory. He is in disguise and wants to be loved for himself, not his position, so he gets his friend to pose as the heir, leading to complications for both men.\n\nThe musical was first produced by [[George Edwardes]] at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in London, opening on February 24, 1912, and running for 336 performances.  It starred [[George Grossmith, Jr.]] as Lord Bicester, [[Edmund Payne]] as Floot and [[Phyllis Dare]] as Delia Dale.  It also had a Broadway run in 1913 at the [[Knickerbocker Theatre (Broadway)|Knickerbocker Theatre]] starring Grossmith's in-law, [[Vernon and Irene Castle|Vernon Castle]].\n\n[[Port Sunlight]] is the real life suburb on which the setting of the musical is based.  The show introduced the [[tango (dance)|tango]] to British audiences.\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe hero, Vernon Blundell, has inherited the great \"Sunshine\" Soap Factory at Port Sunshine, but in the will his uncle inserted a clause that Vernon must not be engaged or married before the expiration of five years; otherwise the whole property will be vested in the various heads of departments on a co-operative basis. Vernon, however, had for some months been working in the factory as an ordinary \"hand\", and in that period of time had fallen in love with pretty Delia Dale, an assistant in the perfumery department. He wants her to love him for himself, rather than for his position, and accordingly he arranges for his stockbroker friend, Lord Bicester, commonly known as \"Bingo\", to personate him and pose as head of the establishment.\n\nAfter some demur, \"Bingo\" agrees to the proposition and trusts to chance that his identity will not be discovered. Unfortunately, he quickly finds himself in a tangle of complications.  He is recognised by his ''fianc\u00e9e'', Lady Rosabelle Meridew, and also by Floot, an ex-cabman, who once drove him from a Covent Garden Fancy Dress Ball after a night of more than ordinary exhilaration. Floot arrives at Port Sunshine on his way from [[Land's End to John o' Groats]], his purpose being to win a \u00a350 prize for walking offered by an enterprising newspaper to whomsoever shall accomplish the journey without begging, borrowing or stealing. Floot immediately sees that he has a good thing on, and Bingo has to purchase his silence by making him the general manager of the soap works.\n\nFloot is married to Brenda Blacker, who was Bingo's travelling companion on his journey home from the ball. She is now engaged as a cook in the household of the Lady Rosabelle and is also carrying on a flirtation with a longshoreman, known as Commodore Parker. At the end, it is declared that no law can stop a man from marrying the woman he loves, and so the terms of the will are over-ridden, and Vernon and Delia prepare to \"live happily ever after\".<ref>This synopsis is based primarily on one printed in ''[[The Play Pictorial]]'', December 1911, pp. 2\u20133</ref>\n\n==Roles and original cast==\n[[File:Sunshine Girl Vernon Delia .jpg|thumb|right|Basil Foster and Phyllis Dare]]\n*Lord Bicester (known as \"Bingo,\" a young Stockbroker) \u2013 [[George Grossmith, Jr.]]\n*Vernon Blundell \u2013 Basil Foster  \n*Commodore Parker (known as \"Nosey,\" of the Blundell Line of Boats) \u2013 George Barrett\n*Hodson (Chief Manager of the Works) \u2013 [[Tom Walls]]  \n*Stepneyak (Manager of the Foreign Department) \u2013 Robert Nainby  \n*Dever, Whitley, Telfridge, Garing, Wears and Nelgrove (Managers of the various Departments of the Works) \n*Clarence (a Footman) \u2013 F.

Business boomed as Suzuki built [[loom|weaving looms]] for Japan's giant silk industry.<ref>{{Cite news |date=29 April 1996 |title=Cars are a sideline for Suzuki; sport-utes carry the load |periodical=Automotive News |issue=5656 |pages=S72(2) }}</ref> In 1929, Michio Suzuki invented a new type of weaving machine, which was exported overseas. The company's first 30 years focused on the development and production of these machines.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nDespite the success of his looms, Suzuki believed that his company would benefit from diversification and he began to look at other products. Based on consumer demand, he decided that building a small car would be the most practical new venture. The project began in 1937, and within two years Suzuki had completed several compact [[prototype]] cars. These first Suzuki motor vehicles were powered by a then-innovative, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, four-cylinder engine. It had a cast aluminum [[crankcase]] and [[gearbox]] and generated {{convert|13|hp}} from a displacement of less than 800cc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nWith the onset of World War II, production plans for Suzuki's new vehicles were halted when the government declared civilian passenger cars a \"non-essential commodity.\" At the conclusion of the war, Suzuki went back to producing looms. Loom production was given a boost when the U.S. government approved the shipping of cotton to Japan. Suzuki's fortunes brightened as orders began to increase from domestic textile manufacturers. But the joy was short-lived as the cotton market collapsed in 1951.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nFaced with this colossal challenge, Suzuki returned to the production of motor vehicles. After the war, the Japanese had a great need for affordable, reliable personal transportation. A number of firms began offering \"clip-on\" gas-powered engines that could be attached to the typical bicycle. Suzuki's first two-wheeled vehicle was a bicycle fitted with a motor called, the \"Power Free.\" Designed to be inexpensive and simple to build and maintain, the [[1952 Power Free]] had a 36&nbsp;cc, one horsepower, [[two-stroke]] engine.<ref name=\"tt\">{{cite web|title=Twist the Throttle: Suzuki|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/video-topics/cars-bikes/car-guide-videos/suzuki-part-one.htm|work=Discovery Channel|publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC.|access-date=23 August 2013|format=Video|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102205317/http://dsc.discovery.com/video-topics/cars-bikes/car-guide-videos/suzuki-part-one.htm|archive-date=2 January 2013}}</ref> The new double-sprocket gear system enabled the rider to either pedal with the engine assisting, pedal without engine assist, or simply disconnect the pedals and run on engine power alone.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} The patent office of the new democratic government granted Suzuki a financial [[subsidy]] to continue research in motorcycle engineering.\n\n[[File:Suzuki Suzulight 01.jpg|thumb|1955 Suzulight]]\nBy 1954, Suzuki was producing 6,000 motorcycles per month and his company had officially changed its name to Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd.

The appropriate engine output, body structure, and required functions were reviewed from the basic design phase in pursuit of mass reduction, rationalization of parts, and high quality. It achieved mass reduction of about 40% compared with a conventional scooter by reducing the size of parts, the application of a new engine, a newly designed frame, and by careful reduction of the number of plastic parts. Such rationalization, including a reduction in the number of parts tightened by nuts and bolts, enabled the Choinori to be sold at the low price of 59,800 yen. Colored resin was used for plastic parts to provide 6 body colors without the need for painting. A new high-speed cylinder plating technology was introduced for the newly developed 4-stroke engine to enable high-speed processing at low cost. This reduced the weight of the engine by about 40% compared with a conventional 50 cc engine.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013091253/http://www.jsae.or.jp/autotech/data_e/4-29e.html|archive-date=13 October 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n[[File:CONCEPT\u30fbS2.JPG|thumb|Suzuki's Concept S2 previews design concepts for the second generation Swift at the 2003 [[Osaka Auto Messe]]]]\n** SMAC opens Suzuki's only U.S. manufacturing facility in [[Rome, Georgia]] and begins producing the [[Suzuki Eiger 400|Eiger]] series of [[All-terrain vehicle|ATVs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Suzuki Becomes a ''Made-in-America'' Manufacturer with Opening of Georgia ATV Plant|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2002/05/31/141262.html|work=The Auto Channel|accessdate=2 October 2013|date=31 May 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Swibel|first=Matthew|title=Hail, Rome!|url=https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2007/0423/082.html|accessdate=2 October 2013|newspaper=Forbes|date=6 April 2007|quote=Suzuki hired its first 60 production workers (24 of them with the Coosa Valley certification) in 2002 and another 100 last year.

The first commercial consignment of 480 cars were sent to Hungary. By sending a consignment of 571 cars to the same country, Maruti crossed the benchmark of 3,000,000 cars.

This model was initially sold as a 3-door [[hatchback]] and would be [[Chevrolet]]'s smallest model.\n[[File:2004.suzuki.grand.vitara.2point0td.arp.jpg|thumb|2004 Suzuki XL-7]]\n\nThe [[Suzuki Jimny|Samurai]] was also introduced in 1985 for the 1986 model year and was the first car introduced to the United States by the newly created American Suzuki Corp. No other Japanese company sold more cars in the United States in its first year than Suzuki. The Samurai was available as a [[Convertible (car)|convertible]] or [[hardtop]] and the company slogan was ''Never a Dull Moment''. The Samurai was successful until [[Consumer Reports]] alleged the Samurai of being susceptible to roll over in a 1988 test. This led to a much publicized [[Suzuki Samurai v Consumers Union|1996 lawsuit]], not settled until 2004.\n\nIn 1989, American Suzuki introduced the [[Suzuki Swift|Swift]] which was the 2nd generation Suzuki Cultus. The Swift was available as a GTi and GLX hatchback with a 4-door sedan following in 1990. A new small SUV called the [[Suzuki Escudo|Sidekick]] was also introduced in 1989. 1991 saw the introduction of the 4-door Suzuki Sidekick, the first 4-door mini-SUV in North America. The Swift and Sidekick were cousins to GM's [[Geo Metro]] and [[Geo Tracker]] and were mostly produced in [[Ingersoll, Ontario|Ingersoll]], Ontario, Canada by Suzuki and GM's joint venture, CAMI. The Swift GT/GTi and 4-door models were imported from Japan. Negative evaluations from [[Consumer Reports]] of the Suzuki Samurai led to some temporary setbacks at American Suzuki as annual sales in the following years dropped to below 20,000 units.\n\nIn 1995, American Suzuki introduced the [[Suzuki Esteem|Esteem]] and redesigned the Swift. The Swift GT was dropped and this version Swift was specific only to North America where it was built at CAMI. These models were the first Suzuki vehicles to be marketed in North America with dual front [[airbag]]s. A [[station wagon]] version of the Esteem was introduced in 1996. Worldwide Suzuki production reached more than 975,000 cars this{{which|date=February 2013}} year.\n\nAlso in 1996, American Suzuki released the 2-door SUV [[Suzuki X-90|X-90]] and a revised [[Suzuki Sidekick|Sidekick Sport]] model with [[airbag|dual airbags]], a {{convert|95|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 1.6&nbsp;liter engine, 15&nbsp;inch wheels. The Sidekick was replaced by the [[Suzuki Escudo|Vitara]] and the [[Suzuki Grand Vitara|Grand Vitara]] for 1999. The Grand Vitara would be Suzuki's first model with a V6-cylinder engine and available 4-wheel [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] brakes.\n\nThe [[Suzuki XL7|XL-7]] was introduced in 1998 as a stretched version of the Grand Vitara. The XL-7 had a larger 2.7&nbsp;liter V6-cylinder engine and 3-row seating. This would be Suzuki's largest vehicle to date.\n\nThe Swift was dropped from the model lineup in 2001 and the [[Suzuki Esteem|Esteem]] was replaced in 2002 by the new [[Suzuki Aerio|Aerio]], which was offered as a 4-door sedan and 5-door [[Crossover SUV|crossover]] with [[Four-wheel drive|4-wheel drive]] as an option.\n\nIn 2004, General Motors and Suzuki jointly purchased the bankrupt [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo Motors]] renaming the venture GMDAT. American Suzuki rebadged the compact [[Daewoo Nubira]]/[[Daewoo Lacetti]] as the [[Suzuki Forenza|Forenza]] and the mid-size [[Daewoo Magnus]] as the [[Suzuki Verona|Verona]]. The [[Suzuki Forenza|Forenza]] gained [[station wagon]] and hatchback body style in 2005, with the hatchback sold under the [[Suzuki Reno|Reno]] name.\n\n2006 was the first year American Suzuki sold more than 100,000 vehicles in the United States. Suzuki redesigned the Grand Vitara in 2006 as well as introduced the all-new [[Suzuki SX4]] and [[Suzuki XL7]] in 2007. The [[Suzuki SX4]] is produced as a joint venture with [[Fiat S.p.A.|Fiat]] and the XL7 (notice the shortening of the name from Grand Vitara XL-7) was produced as a joint venture with GM at CAMI Automotive Inc. in Ingersoll. Suzuki put XL7 production on indefinite hiatus in mid-2009 due to low demand and subsequently sold off its share of CAMI back to GM later that year.\n\nDespite a difficult domestic US automarket, Suzuki kept pace with its 2007 sales numbers in 2008.

After all, it is famous for making motorcycles as well as clever small cars. The PIXY is Suzuki's answer to Toyota's i-Real. The difference is that Suzuki has built a small van-like 'car' (called the SSC, for Suzuki Sharing Coach) that the PIXY docks into. So, you can drive on main roads in your SSC and then scoot along the footpath in your PIXY. It's a dream for now, but Suzuki already produces a small motorised buggy for the elderly, so maybe this isn't so far away after all.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Simister|first=John|title=Tokyo Motor Show: I have seen the future \u2013 and it's fun|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/features/tokyo-motor-show-i-have-seen-the-future--and-its-fun-398262.html|accessdate=31 October 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=30 October 2007|quote=Take those wheeled pods. For the third Tokyo show in succession, the latest variation on the theme was revealed: the i-Real. This is a motorised chair that leans back as it speeds up, and leans into corners. Its name suggests that Toyota is serious about this device. Do you think it could work? No, nor do I. Suzuki does, though, and takes the notion a stage further with its Pixy + SSC. The Pixy part is, again, a three-wheeled, single-seater pod, this time weatherproof with a windscreen and roof, two of which can dock inside the Suzuki Sharing Coach (SSC) for higher speeds and longer drives. Electricity comes from a hydrogen fuel cell and solar energy, and the SSC recharges the Pixies as it drives along.}}</ref>\n*'''X-HEAD''' is a concept vehicle that debuted at the 2007 Tokyo Auto Show.

But while the GSX-R750 engine was air and oil-cooled, the baby brother had a liquid-cooled engine. Not many examples are seen outside Japan. 17-inch cast wheels and 300&nbsp;mm twin disc brake at the front. The GSX-R250 had impressive power and was made primarily as a road legal 250 cc racing bike reaching speeds of 200+km/h (124&nbsp;mph). Imported specimens may be seen in Australia and New Zealand commonly. Also, around 350 units were exported to Denmark around 1989 to 1992.\n\n====Other power sources====\n[[File:Suzuki Burgman Fuel Cell cutaway model 2011 Tokyo Motor Show.jpg|thumb|Cutaway model of the Burgman Fuel Cell Scooter at the [[Tokyo Motor Show#2011|2011 Tokyo Motor Show]]|alt=]]\n* [[Suzuki RE5|RE5]] was the first (and only) Japanese motorcycle produced with a [[Wankel engine|Wankel rotary engine]].

Business boomed as Suzuki built [[loom|weaving looms]] for Japan's giant silk industry.<ref>{{Cite news |date=29 April 1996 |title=Cars are a sideline for Suzuki; sport-utes carry the load |periodical=Automotive News |issue=5656 |pages=S72(2) }}</ref> In 1929, Michio Suzuki invented a new type of weaving machine, which was exported overseas. The company's first 30 years focused on the development and production of these machines.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nDespite the success of his looms, Suzuki believed that his company would benefit from diversification and he began to look at other products. Based on consumer demand, he decided that building a small car would be the most practical new venture. The project began in 1937, and within two years Suzuki had completed several compact [[prototype]] cars. These first Suzuki motor vehicles were powered by a then-innovative, liquid-cooled, four-stroke, four-cylinder engine. It had a cast aluminum [[crankcase]] and [[gearbox]] and generated {{convert|13|hp}} from a displacement of less than 800cc.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nWith the onset of World War II, production plans for Suzuki's new vehicles were halted when the government declared civilian passenger cars a \"non-essential commodity.\" At the conclusion of the war, Suzuki went back to producing looms. Loom production was given a boost when the U.S. government approved the shipping of cotton to Japan. Suzuki's fortunes brightened as orders began to increase from domestic textile manufacturers. But the joy was short-lived as the cotton market collapsed in 1951.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\nFaced with this colossal challenge, Suzuki returned to the production of motor vehicles. After the war, the Japanese had a great need for affordable, reliable personal transportation. A number of firms began offering \"clip-on\" gas-powered engines that could be attached to the typical bicycle. Suzuki's first two-wheeled vehicle was a bicycle fitted with a motor called, the \"Power Free.\" Designed to be inexpensive and simple to build and maintain, the [[1952 Power Free]] had a 36&nbsp;cc, one horsepower, [[two-stroke]] engine.<ref name=\"tt\">{{cite web|title=Twist the Throttle: Suzuki|url=http://dsc.discovery.com/video-topics/cars-bikes/car-guide-videos/suzuki-part-one.htm|work=Discovery Channel|publisher=Discovery Communications, LLC.|access-date=23 August 2013|format=Video|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102205317/http://dsc.discovery.com/video-topics/cars-bikes/car-guide-videos/suzuki-part-one.htm|archive-date=2 January 2013}}</ref> The new double-sprocket gear system enabled the rider to either pedal with the engine assisting, pedal without engine assist, or simply disconnect the pedals and run on engine power alone.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}} The patent office of the new democratic government granted Suzuki a financial [[subsidy]] to continue research in motorcycle engineering.\n\n[[File:Suzuki Suzulight 01.jpg|thumb|1955 Suzulight]]\nBy 1954, Suzuki was producing 6,000 motorcycles per month and his company had officially changed its name to Suzuki Motor Co., Ltd.

Over the years, the product range has widened and ownership has changed hands as the customer has evolved.\n\nMaruti Suzuki offers models ranging from the [[Maruti 800]] to the premium [[sedan (car)|sedan]] [[Suzuki Kizashi#Kizashi in India|Maruti Suzuki Kizashi]] and luxury SUV Maruti Suzuki Grand Vitara. Maruti 800 was the first model launched by the company in 1983 followed by mini-van [[Maruti Omni]] in 1984. [[Maruti Gypsy]], launched in 1985, came into widespread use with the [[Indian Army]] and [[Indian Police Service]] becoming its primary customers. The short-lived [[Maruti 1000]] was replaced by [[Maruti Esteem]] in 1994.\n\n[[Maruti Zen]], launched in 1993, was the company's second compact car model. The company went on to launch another compact car [[Maruti Wagon-R]] followed by [[Maruti Baleno]] in 1999. It was later replaced by the Suzuki SX4. The SX4 further was replaced by [[Maruti Suzuki Ciaz|Ciaz]].\n\nIn 2000, [[Maruti Alto]] was launched. The Maruti models include Maruti [[Suzuki Grand Vitara]], launched in 2003, [[Maruti Versa]], launched in 2004, [[Maruti Swift|Maruti Suzuki Swift]], launched in 2005, [[Maruti Zen Estilo]] and Maruti [[Suzuki SX4]], launched in 2007.\n\nOn 14 February 2011, Maruti announced that it had achieved one million total accumulated production volume of the Alto. The Alto has reached the million units mark in just seven years and five months since its launch in September 2000. The last half of the million was achieved in 25 months. The Alto became the third car by Maruti Suzuki stable to cross the million units mark, following the Maruti 800 and the Omni.\n\nIn January 2012 at the New Delhi [[Auto Expo]], Maruti presented a new car called the [[Maruti XA Alpha|Maruti Suzuki XA Alpha]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://overdrive.in/details/1385/Maruti-Suzuki-XA-Alpha-origins |title=Maruti Suzuki XA Alpha origins \u2013 Overdrive |publisher=Overdrive.in |date=15 March 2011 |access-date=17 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225032354/http://overdrive.in/details/1385/Maruti-Suzuki-XA-Alpha-origins |archive-date=25 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.marutisuzuki.com/concept-xa-alpha-unveiled.aspx |title= Concept XA Alpha unveiled |publisher= Marutisuzuki.com |date= 5 January 2012 |access-date= 17 April 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130524183527/http://www.marutisuzuki.com/concept-xa-alpha-unveiled.aspx |archive-date= 24 May 2013 |url-status= dead}}</ref> to commence production in mid-late 2013.\nMaruti Suzuki unveiled the Vitara Brezza in the Indian Auto Expo 2016 as a contender in the compact SUV segment.\n\n[[Maruti Exports]] Limited is Maruti's exporting subsidiary and, as such, does not operate in the domestic Indian market except in its capacity as an exporter for [[Maruti Suzuki]] and for the international [[Suzuki Motor Corporation]] as well as their other affiliates.

This model was initially sold as a 3-door [[hatchback]] and would be [[Chevrolet]]'s smallest model.\n[[File:2004.suzuki.grand.vitara.2point0td.arp.jpg|thumb|2004 Suzuki XL-7]]\n\nThe [[Suzuki Jimny|Samurai]] was also introduced in 1985 for the 1986 model year and was the first car introduced to the United States by the newly created American Suzuki Corp. No other Japanese company sold more cars in the United States in its first year than Suzuki. The Samurai was available as a [[Convertible (car)|convertible]] or [[hardtop]] and the company slogan was ''Never a Dull Moment''. The Samurai was successful until [[Consumer Reports]] alleged the Samurai of being susceptible to roll over in a 1988 test. This led to a much publicized [[Suzuki Samurai v Consumers Union|1996 lawsuit]], not settled until 2004.\n\nIn 1989, American Suzuki introduced the [[Suzuki Swift|Swift]] which was the 2nd generation Suzuki Cultus. The Swift was available as a GTi and GLX hatchback with a 4-door sedan following in 1990. A new small SUV called the [[Suzuki Escudo|Sidekick]] was also introduced in 1989. 1991 saw the introduction of the 4-door Suzuki Sidekick, the first 4-door mini-SUV in North America. The Swift and Sidekick were cousins to GM's [[Geo Metro]] and [[Geo Tracker]] and were mostly produced in [[Ingersoll, Ontario|Ingersoll]], Ontario, Canada by Suzuki and GM's joint venture, CAMI. The Swift GT/GTi and 4-door models were imported from Japan. Negative evaluations from [[Consumer Reports]] of the Suzuki Samurai led to some temporary setbacks at American Suzuki as annual sales in the following years dropped to below 20,000 units.\n\nIn 1995, American Suzuki introduced the [[Suzuki Esteem|Esteem]] and redesigned the Swift. The Swift GT was dropped and this version Swift was specific only to North America where it was built at CAMI. These models were the first Suzuki vehicles to be marketed in North America with dual front [[airbag]]s. A [[station wagon]] version of the Esteem was introduced in 1996. Worldwide Suzuki production reached more than 975,000 cars this{{which|date=February 2013}} year.\n\nAlso in 1996, American Suzuki released the 2-door SUV [[Suzuki X-90|X-90]] and a revised [[Suzuki Sidekick|Sidekick Sport]] model with [[airbag|dual airbags]], a {{convert|95|hp|kW|abbr=on}} 1.6&nbsp;liter engine, 15&nbsp;inch wheels. The Sidekick was replaced by the [[Suzuki Escudo|Vitara]] and the [[Suzuki Grand Vitara|Grand Vitara]] for 1999. The Grand Vitara would be Suzuki's first model with a V6-cylinder engine and available 4-wheel [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] brakes.\n\nThe [[Suzuki XL7|XL-7]] was introduced in 1998 as a stretched version of the Grand Vitara. The XL-7 had a larger 2.7&nbsp;liter V6-cylinder engine and 3-row seating. This would be Suzuki's largest vehicle to date.\n\nThe Swift was dropped from the model lineup in 2001 and the [[Suzuki Esteem|Esteem]] was replaced in 2002 by the new [[Suzuki Aerio|Aerio]], which was offered as a 4-door sedan and 5-door [[Crossover SUV|crossover]] with [[Four-wheel drive|4-wheel drive]] as an option.\n\nIn 2004, General Motors and Suzuki jointly purchased the bankrupt [[GM Daewoo|Daewoo Motors]] renaming the venture GMDAT. American Suzuki rebadged the compact [[Daewoo Nubira]]/[[Daewoo Lacetti]] as the [[Suzuki Forenza|Forenza]] and the mid-size [[Daewoo Magnus]] as the [[Suzuki Verona|Verona]]. The [[Suzuki Forenza|Forenza]] gained [[station wagon]] and hatchback body style in 2005, with the hatchback sold under the [[Suzuki Reno|Reno]] name.\n\n2006 was the first year American Suzuki sold more than 100,000 vehicles in the United States. Suzuki redesigned the Grand Vitara in 2006 as well as introduced the all-new [[Suzuki SX4]] and [[Suzuki XL7]] in 2007. The [[Suzuki SX4]] is produced as a joint venture with [[Fiat S.p.A.|Fiat]] and the XL7 (notice the shortening of the name from Grand Vitara XL-7) was produced as a joint venture with GM at CAMI Automotive Inc. in Ingersoll. Suzuki put XL7 production on indefinite hiatus in mid-2009 due to low demand and subsequently sold off its share of CAMI back to GM later that year.\n\nDespite a difficult domestic US automarket, Suzuki kept pace with its 2007 sales numbers in 2008.

After all, it is famous for making motorcycles as well as clever small cars. The PIXY is Suzuki's answer to Toyota's i-Real. The difference is that Suzuki has built a small van-like 'car' (called the SSC, for Suzuki Sharing Coach) that the PIXY docks into. So, you can drive on main roads in your SSC and then scoot along the footpath in your PIXY. It's a dream for now, but Suzuki already produces a small motorised buggy for the elderly, so maybe this isn't so far away after all.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Simister|first=John|title=Tokyo Motor Show: I have seen the future \u2013 and it's fun|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/motoring/features/tokyo-motor-show-i-have-seen-the-future--and-its-fun-398262.html|accessdate=31 October 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=30 October 2007|quote=Take those wheeled pods.

Its name suggests that Toyota is serious about this device. Do you think it could work? No, nor do I. Suzuki does, though, and takes the notion a stage further with its Pixy + SSC. The Pixy part is, again, a three-wheeled, single-seater pod, this time weatherproof with a windscreen and roof, two of which can dock inside the Suzuki Sharing Coach (SSC) for higher speeds and longer drives.

Its shape generates a feeling of openness in a modern machine powered by a V-four engine.<ref name=\"Suzuki2007\">{{cite web|title=Suzuki at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show|url=http://www.globalsuzuki.com/globalnews/2007/1001.html|work=Global News|publisher=Suzuki Motor Corp|accessdate=28 October 2013|date=1 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Suzuki Biplane Concept \u2013 First Look|url=http://www.cycleworld.com/2007/10/25/tokyo-%E2%80%9907-suzuki-biplane-concept-first-look/|work=Cycle World|publisher=Bonnier Corp|access-date=28 October 2013|quote=This is the Suzuki Biplane, penned at Suzuki's recently re-opened U.S. design center. Suzuki's goal was to give the rider the sensation of flying in a vintage biplane with no canopy, a distilled, in-the-wind riding experience. It (conceptually) uses a V-Four motor, with cylinder heads and exhaust headers visible on the sides, just like the fabric-skinned twin-wingers of the last century. The front end gets a girder fork (kinda like the Confederate Wraith) and rim-mounted brake discs (a la Buell XB). The exhaust is tucked in underneath the cowling, and the link-type rear suspension can be seen under the tractor-style seat.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109161054/http://www.cycleworld.com/2007/10/25/tokyo-%E2%80%9907-suzuki-biplane-concept-first-look/|archive-date=9 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Garrett\">{{cite news|last=Garrett|first=Jerry|title=Tokyo Motor Show: Two-Wheel Thunderdome|url=http://wheels.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/10/29/tokyo-motor-show-two-wheeled-thunderdome/|accessdate=28 October 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=29 October 2007|quote=The Suzukis are wild. Silent runner: the Crosscage is a fuel cell bike that really works; no gas engine at all. The powerplant is made by Intelligent Energy of the U.K., the same group that made the ENV fuel cell bike I tested \u2013 and thought was viable even if it sounded like a U.F.O., not a bike. The Biplane supposedly has a V-4, but the show bike is most likely a make-believe mockup. Looks to be straight out of a video game. When will either Suzuki be produced? Right after the 12th of Never.}}</ref>\n* '''Crosscage''' concept model was displayed at the [[Tokyo Motor Show#2007|2007 Tokyo Motor Show]]. Combining a high-performance secondary battery and a compact, lightweight air-cooled fuel-cell system from British specialist company [[Intelligent Energy]] enabled quick activation with low fuel consumption. The lithium-ion battery assured reserve power as well as minimal environmental impact. Light weight not only made this bike environment-friendly but also sporty.<ref name=\"Suzuki2007\" /><ref name=\"Garrett\" />\n* [[Suzuki Gemma|Gemma]] prototype model was introduced at the [[Tokyo Motor Show#2007|2007 Tokyo Motor Show]]. The distinctive \"full-flat 2-seater,\" 250&nbsp;cc four-stroke single-cylinder scooter is low and sleek and gives the rider and passenger feel a greater sense of intimacy. The luggage compartment in front of the rider holds a helmet.

The large dual seat is almost completely flat to keep rider and passenger weight low, and a large lockable cubby hole in front of the rider is big enough to take a helmet. The gemma is currently just a concept, but the concept appears well developed enough to reach production if the Japanese public like the idea.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=First Look: Suzuki Gemma 250|url=http://www.visordown.com/motorcycle-news--general-news/first-look-suzuki-gemma-250/5054.html|work=Visordown|publisher=Immediate Media Company|accessdate=28 October 2013|date=3 July 2008|quote=The scooter looks set for the Japanese market only for the time being, but given the recent fuel price hikes there are strong rumours of it finding its way over here.
