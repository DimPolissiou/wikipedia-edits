Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities. One common factor for all the authors is that they ignored not only the dialects they wrote about, but also the Slavic languages entirely.

Boukouvalas published in 1905 in Cairo a brief brochure under the title \"The language of the Bulgarophones in Macedonia\" (1905). This essay, which assumed the Slav character of the foreign-language idioms of Greek Macedonia by naming them \"Bulgarian\", included a long list of Slavic words with Greek roots which are used in the dialects. ... Konstantinos Tsioulkas published in 1907 in Athens a book over 350 pages in length to prove the ancient Greek character of the idioms in Greek Macecionia!... : \"Contributions to the bilinguism of the Macedonians by comparison of the Slav'-like Macedonian language to Greek\" ... Tsioulkas \"proved\" through a series of \"etymological\" lists that the inhabitants of Greece's Macedonia spoke a pure Ancient-Greek dialect. ... In 1948 by a third teacher, Giorgos Georgiades, (wrote) under the promising title \"The mixed idiom in Macedonia and the ethnological situation of the Macedonians who speak it\". Here it is stated that many words from the dialects maintain their \"Ancient Greek character\". Still, the language itself was presented as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and words borrowed from other languages. As a result, the author found himself incapable of defining it as either Greek or Slav. In examining such publications, one will easily recognise ideological and methodological similarities. One common factor for all the authors is that they ignored not only the dialects they wrote about, but also the Slavic languages entirely. This fact did not hinder them in creating or republishing etymological lists tracing every Slavic word back to Ancient Greek with fictional correlations.}}</ref> Among them, Boukouvalas promoted an enormous influence of the [[Greek language]] on a Bulgarian idiom and a discussion about their probable Greek descent.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> Tsioulkas followed him by publishing a large book, where he \"proved\" through an \"etymological\" approach, that these idioms are a pure [[Ancient Greek]] dialect.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> A publication of the third teacher followed, Giorgos Georgiades, who presented the language as a mixture of Greek, Turkish and other loanwords, but was incapable of deifining the dialects as either Greek or Slav.<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/>\n\nSerbian dialectology does not usually extend the Serbian dialects to Greek Macedonia, but an unconventional classification has been maken by [[Aleksandar Beli\u0107]], a convinced Serbian nationalist, who regarded the dialects as [[Serbian dialects|Serbian]].<ref name=\"Ioannidou\"/> In [[:File:Balkan dialects belic 1914.jpg|his classification]] he distinguished three categories of dialects in Greek Macedonia: a Serbo-Macedonian dialect, a Bulgaro-Macedonian teritorry where Serbian is spoken and a Non-Slavic territory.\n\n=== Ban for use ===\nAfter the conclusion of the [[First World War]] a widespread policy of Hellenisation was implemented in the Greek region of Macedonia.{{sfn|HRW|1994|p=?}}<ref name=\"Nettle 2000 175\">{{cite book\n | last = Nettle\n | first = Daniel\n | authorlink = \n | author2 = Suzanne Romaine\n | title = Vanishing Voices: The Extinction of the World's Languages\n | publisher = Oxford University Press US\n | year = 2000\n | location = \n | page = [https://archive.org/details/vanishingvoicese00nett_0/page/175 175]\n | isbn = 0-19-513624-1\n | url = https://archive.org/details/vanishingvoicese00nett_0/page/175\n }}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n | last = Pentzopoulos\n | first = Dimitri\n | title = The Balkan exchange of minorities and its impact on Greece\n | publisher = C.
