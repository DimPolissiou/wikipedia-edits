The Council's principal tasks are to:\n\n* analyse global environment and development problems and report on these, \n* review and evaluate national and international research in the field of global change,\n* provide early warning of new issue areas,\n* identify gaps in research and to initiate new research,\n* monitor and assess national and international policies for the achievement of sustainable development,\n* elaborate recommendations for action and research and\n* raise public awareness and heighten the media profile of global change issues.\n\nThe WBGU also comments on current events, such as the [[United Nations Climate Change conference]]s (e.g., in Paris 2015), the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (Rio+20), the adoption of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (2015),<ref>http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-8-2014-sdg/</ref> the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development [[Habitat III]]<ref>http://www.wbgu.de/fileadmin/templates/dateien/veroeffentlichungen/weitere/statement_habitat_2016.pdf</ref> (2016) or Germany's [[G20]] presidency in 2017.<ref>http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2016-g20/</ref>\n\n==Reports==\n\n===Flagship Reports===\n\n====Towards our Common Digital Future (2019)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/fr2019 Flagship report 2019], \u201eTowards our Common Digital Future\u201c</ref>====\nWithout creative political action, digital change will further accelerate resource and energy consumption, and exacerbate damage to the environment and the climate. It is therefore an urgent political task to create the conditions needed to place digitalization at the service of sustainable development; this is one of the key messages of the report \"Towards our Common Digital Future\" [LINK]. In the short term, the aim is to harmonize digitalization with the global sustainability goals agreed in 2015 (SDGs, Agenda 2030) and the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. New technologies should be used specifically and comprehensively to give people access to basic services such as healthcare, education, energy and (environmental) information and to prevent environmental degradation. Examples include promoting the energy-system transformation using intelligent energy networks, reducing vehicular traffic in cities by means of shared mobility (which makes owning a car superfluous), and using digital technologies to promote a [[circular economy]]. In addition, precautions must already be taken today to deal with the profound societal upheavals that will accompany digitalization in the medium term. Examples include the foreseeable radical structural change on the labour markets, the replacement of real-world experiences in virtual spaces, the manifold impacts of artificial intelligence on education, science and democracy, and the challenge of democratically restricting the surveillance potential of new technologies. According to the WBGU's new report, all digital changes should be geared towards the common good and improving people's quality of life. Finally, another issue is preparing for possible long-term upheavals. For example, in human-machine interaction, risks to human integrity are already recognizable today. This concerns, for example, sensitive neuro-data or neuro-prostheses, whose ethical aspects have been insufficiently taken into account up to now. In the age of digitalization, it is necessary to redefine our understanding of 'human development\u2018.\n\n====Humanity on the move: The transformative power of cities (2016)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2016-urbanization/ Flagship report 2016], \u201eHumanity on the move: The transformative power of cities\u201c</ref>====\nThe momentum of urbanization and its impacts are so massive that we must face up to this trend. In view of the existing cognitive, technical, economic and institutional path dependencies, a policy of business as usual \u2013 i.e. an unstructured, quasi-automatic urbanization \u2013 would lead to a non-sustainable \u2018world cities society\u2019. Only if cities and urban societies are sufficiently empowered can they make use of the opportunities for sustainability and successfully follow the urban transformation pathways. The success or failure of the Great Transformation will be decided in the cities. The WBGU discusses the relevant conditions for the success of this transformation in this report.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Governing the Marine Heritage (2013)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2013-oceans/ Flagship report 2013], \u201eWorld in Transition: Governing the Marine Heritage.\u201c</ref>====\nDespite numerous international treaties and voluntary commitments, the seas are still being massively overfished, polluted and increasingly exploited as the Earth's last resort. In view of the oceans\u2019 poor condition, the WBGU developed a long-term vision of the conservation and sustainable use of the blue continent: All marine zones with the exception of territorial waters should be declared as common heritage of mankind. In order to move closer to this ultimate goal for [[ocean governance]], the WBGU also gives recommendations for action that link up with ongoing political processes, especially for two focal themes: food ([[sustainable fisheries]] and [[aquaculture]]) and energy from the sea. The report shows that sustainable stewardship of the oceans is urgently necessary, that the seas can be incorporated into a transformation towards a low-carbon, sustainable society, and that such a transformation can achieve substantial benefits worldwide both for a sustainable energy supply and for food security.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 A Social Contract for Sustainability (2011)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/wbgu_jg2011_en/ Flagship report 2011], \u201eWorld in Transition: A Social Contract for Sustainability.\u201c</ref>====\n\nIn this report, the WBGU explains the reasons for the desperate need for a post-fossil economic strategy, yet it also concludes that the transition to sustainability is achievable, and presents ten concrete packages of measures to accelerate the imperative restructuring. If the transformation really is to succeed, we have to enter into a social contract for innovation, in the form of a new kind of discourse between governments and citizens, both within and beyond the boundaries of the nation state.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Future Bioenergy and Sustainable Land Use (2008)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2008-bioenergy/ Flagship report 2008], \u201eWorld in Transition: Future Bioenergy and Sustainable Land Use.\u201c</ref>====\nIn view of the major opportunities and risks associated with it, and the complexity of the subject, bioenergy policy has in a short time become a challenging political task for regulators and planners \u2013 a task which can only be accomplished through worldwide cooperation and the creation of an international framework. WBGU's central message is that use should be made of the sustainable potential of bioenergy which can be tapped all over the world, provided that risks to sustainability are excluded. In particular, the use of bioenergy must not endanger food security or the goals of nature conservation and climate change mitigation.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013  Climate Change as a Security Risk (2007)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2007\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2007-security/ Flagship report 2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216130144/http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2007-security/ |date=2017-12-16 }}, \u201eWorld in Transition: Climate Change as a Security Risk.\u201c</ref>====\nWithout resolute counteraction, climate change will overstretch many societies\u2019 adaptive capacities within the coming decades. This could result in destabilization and violence, jeopardizing national and international security to a new degree. However, climate change could also unite the international community, provided that it recognizes climate change as a threat to humankind and soon sets the course for the avoidance of dangerous anthropogenic climate change by adopting a dynamic and globally coordinated climate policy. If it fails to do so, climate change will draw ever-deeper lines of division and conflict in international relations, triggering numerous conflicts between and within countries over the distribution of resources, especially water and land, over the management of migration, or over compensation payments between the countries mainly responsible for climate change and those countries most affected by its destructive effects. That is the backdrop against which WBGU, in this flagship report, summarizes the state-of-the-art of science on the subject of \u201cClimate Change as a Security Risk\u201d. It is based on the findings of research into environmental conflicts, the causes of war, and of climate impact research. It appraises past experience but also ventures to cast a glance far into the future in order to assess the likely impacts of climate change on societies, nation-states, regions and the international system.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Fighting Poverty through Environmental Policy (2004)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2004\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2004-poverty/ Flagship report 2004], \u201eWorld in Transition: Fighting Poverty through Environmental Policy.\u201c</ref>====\nAt the start of the 21st century, fighting poverty and protecting the environment are two of the most urgent challenges facing the international community. Narrowing the massive disparities in the satisfaction of basic needs and distribution of prosperity must be a primary objective. Extreme poverty, such as that prevailing above all in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and South Asia, is the most obvious manifestation of the untenable imbalance in the world's social system. The recommendations for action set out in this report are based on an analysis of the systemic links between poverty (income poverty, disease, malnutrition, and lack of education, social stability and social capital) and environmental changes (climate change, lack of water resources, [[water pollution]], [[soil degradation]], loss of [[biological diversity]] and resources, and air pollution). The manifestations of and interactions between poverty and environmental problems are investigated in their various forms. This type of integrated analysis is nothing new; what is new, however, is the consistent linking of a holistic approach with the following key questions: which institutional arrangements offer ways of coping with these problems, and where must gaps be closed? To this end, WBGU has evaluated major international political processes and developed recommendations on policy coherence. It also presents various recommendations on further research to identify the strategic gaps in theoretical and practical knowledge.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Towards Sustainable Energy Systems (2003)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2003\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2003-energy/ Flagship report 2003], \u201eWorld in Transition: Towards Sustainable Energy Systems.\u201c</ref>====\nThe report underscores the urgent need to transform global energy systems so that the world's population has access to energy based on renewable sources. This is necessary in order to protect the global climate and to liberate 2.4&nbsp;billion people in developing countries from energy poverty. Such an approach would also yield a peace dividend by reducing dependence upon regionally concentrated oil reserves. The scientists stress that such a reconfiguration of energy systems is feasible and fundable if rapid and resolute action is taken in the coming two decades. To this end, they propose a roadmap with specific milestones.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 New Structures for Global Environmental Policy (2000)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2001\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2000-institutions/ Flagship report 2000], \u201eWorld in Transition: New Structures for Global Environmental Policy.\u201c</ref>====\nToday, more than 900 bi- and multilateral environmental treaties are in force. Nonetheless, the most pressing problems of global change remain unresolved, some are even intensifying. The international institutional and organisational architecture has proven too weak to provide effective and efficient responses to these challenges. In this situation, the WBGU has developed a vision for reforming the United Nations in the environmental arena. It terms this the \u2018Earth Alliance\u2019, comprising three interlocking realms. First, to provide authority in the assessment of environmental problems, the WBGU proposes establishing an independent body whose task is to provide timely warning of particularly risk-laden developments in the sphere of global change \u2013 Earth Assessment. Second, the report gives recommendations for redesigning the organisational core of global environmental policy \u2013 [[Earth Organisation]]. This revolves around the step-wise establishment of an International Environmental Organisation, building on the existing [[United Nations Environment Programme]] as its initial nucleus. Third, the WBGU highlights new avenues for financing global environmental policy \u2013 Earth Funding.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013  Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Biosphere (1999)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1999\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1999-biosphere/ Flagship report 1999], \u201eWorld in Transition: Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Biosphere.\u201c</ref>====\nBiodiversity - the planet's natural capital - is undergoing a dramatic collapse: its 'Sixth Extinction'. The losses, which are due to human activities and overexploitation of the biosphere, are irreversible. They are undermining the basis of future wellbeing and prosperity - including genetic resources and food production, climate stability, and coastal and soil protection. This volume presents an authoritative and alarming analysis of the state of the biosphere. The WBGU shows that the time remaining for remedial action is disappearing fast and sets out a range of initiatives to be undertaken at different levels. The main recommendations are:\n- protecting 10-20 per cent of the global land area\n- an 'Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity' to provide scientific advice\n- conservation of the diversity of cultivated as well as wild plant species\n- extending bioregional management and nature sponsorship\n- greater multilateral co-operation and implementation of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Strategies for Managing Global Environmental Risks (1998)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1998\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1998-global-risks/ Flagship report 1998], \u201eWorld in Transition: Strategies for Managing Global Environmental Risks.\u201c</ref>====\nGlobal risk potentials and their interplay with economic, social and ecological processes of change have emerged as a challenge to the international community. Never before has human intervention in nature assumed global dimensions. This has been driven on the one hand by a growing global population, particularly in developing countries, and on the other hand by rising human demands in conjunction with specific patterns of production and consumption, above all in industrialised countries. By presenting this report, the WBGU hopes to contribute constructively to an effective, efficient and objective management of the risks of global change. The approach taken by the WBGU is first to classify globally relevant risks and then to assign to these classes of risk both established and innovative risk assessment strategies and risk management tools. On this basis, management priorities can be set. However, the WBGU notes that it is impossible to safeguard against all global risks, particularly as exploiting opportunities will always entail taking risks.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Ways Towards Sustainable Management of Freshwater Resources (1997)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1997\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1997-water/ Flagship report 1997], \u201eWorld in Transition: Ways Towards Sustainable Management of Freshwater Resources.\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe global water crisis is expected to become more severe in the near future. The WBGU presents an analysis of specific regions that are presently most affected by water shortages, and regions that will be particularly threatened by future water crises. In line with its past reports on global change, the WBGU examines three major \"syndromes of global change\" that are strongly linked to the worldwide water crisis. Based on this analysis, explicit recommendations for future research and for political action are presented.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 The Research Challenge  (1996)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1996\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1996-research/ Flagship report 1996], \u201eWorld in Transition: The Research Challenge.\u201c</ref>====\nDevelopment and environment problems have reached such alarming dimensions that the very survival of humanity is now subject to critical and unprecedented threats. So far, the scientific community has failed to deliver strategic responses adequate to this situation. Analyses produced by the separate disciplines are similarly inadequate due to the complexity of the problems involved and the intricate interlinkages between them. In this report, the WBGU criticizes Germany's global change research community for its lack of international orientation, its bias towards individual disciplines and for its weaknesses in translating scientific results into a form readily accessible to policymakers. The WBGU identifies alternatives for restructuring the research landscape, focusing primarily on a new \"Syndrome Approach\" for global change research. By applying this tool, scientists can systematically describe and analyze the \"diseases\" afflicting the Earth System, and thus elaborate response options. The 16 most important syndromes, or \"clinical profiles\" of Planet Earth were identified.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Ways Towards Global Environmental Solutions (1995)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1995\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1995-global-policy/ Flagship report 1995], \u201eWorld in Transition: Ways Towards Global Environmental Solutions.\u201c</ref>====\nIn many areas of global change solutions are not at sight. However, dedicated and immediate action could, in principle, avert irreversible or disastrous damage to the global environment. Whether these steps will actually be taken will have to be seen, since substantial efforts and significant reorientations at the local, national and global level are necessary.\n\nTwo aspects have to be considered: on the one hand, at the societal level, the prerequisites for solving global environmental problems have to be improved. These measures present a challenge to nations and societies as a whole, where nongovernmental organisations could also play an important role. On the other hand, at the governmental level, international agreements must be formulated or intensified and enforced by suitable measures.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 The Threat to Soils (1994)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1994\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1994-soils/ Flagship report 1994], \u201eWorld in Transition: The Threat to Soils.\u201c</ref>====\nSoils form an essential basis for humanity, but have received too little attention to date. In differing respects, human activities in many parts of the world lead to various levels of soil degradation, from declining fertility to irreversible destruction. Many local processes culminate to form a global environmental trend that must be counteracted by political action as a matter of urgency. The fact that the slow destruction of soils is a process barely perceptible to human senses has meant in turn that this topic is dealt with in the environmental debate as a somewhat marginal issue. Therefore, the threat to soils must be accorded much greater significance on the environmental agenda - improved legal frameworks must be created, both nationally and internationally, for soils as an environmental asset. The report is divided into two sections. The first section (standard section) presents and comments on new developments in various fields of Global Change. The second section of the report (focus section) deals with the global threat to soils. The WBGU emphasises that, in view of the seriousness of the soil problems outlined in this report, a new efficient institutional framework should now be established. For this reason the German Federal Government should decide in principle whether a differentiated \"Soil Declaration\" suffices or whether a global \"Soil Convention\" has to be striven for. This report provides the relevant arguments for both instruments. Global soil protection must obtain a similar attention on the international agenda as has been achieved for climate policy.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013  Basic Structure of Global People-Environment Interactions (1993)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1993\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1993-people-environment/ Flagship report 1993], \u201eWorld in Transition: Basic Structure of Global People-Environment Interactions.\u201c</ref>====\nIn this report, the WBGU endeavours to provide a holistic analysis of the Earth System, whereby the central focus is directed at the principal interactions between nature and society. The aim here is to demonstrate the complexity of environmental problems, on the one hand, and to create, on the other, the analytical basis for assessing the impact of current trends on the system as a whole. The most serious global problems and major global trends in the estimation of the WBGU are:\n\n* Growth of the world's population\n* Long-term changes in the composition of the atmosphere\n* Loss of biodiversity\n* Degradation and loss of soils\n\nConcluding its report, the WBGU lays particular emphasis on three general recommendations:\n- German development aid should be increased to 1% of the GNP, whereby the term 'developing countries' should be redefined to include the states of Eastern Europe.\n- With respect to the instruments discussed in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the WBGU recommends that negotiations concerning a certificate scheme for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions should be started, with the aim of achieving its international implementation. Parallel to the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that would then occur, efforts should be made to increase the financial transfers for the protection of the tropical forests.\n- Programmes should be developed aiming at sensitising citizens to global environmental problems and promoting environmentally friendly behaviour.\n\n===Special Reports===\n\n====Development and justice through transformation: The Four Big \u2018I\u2019s  (2016)<ref name=\"Special Report 2016\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2016-g20/ Special report 2016], \u201eDevelopment and justice through transformation: The Four Big \u2018I\u2019s \u201c</ref>====\n2015 saw a historic double success for sustainability and climate policy. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Paris Agreement on climate protection establish a system of ambitious policy goals for the world. The group of twenty major industrialized and emerging economies (G20) now needs to resolutely advance implementation of both agreements, seizing the opportunity of this \u2018Great Transformation\u2019 to sustainability as a unique modernization project that could offer substantial economic development opportunities. Complete decarbonization of the world economy, which is necessary to avoid the gravest climate risks, can only be achieved by profoundly transforming energy systems and other high-emissions infrastructures. This transformation could inspire Innovation and channel Investment into sustainability and climate protection, and into the kinds of sustainable Infrastructures that need to be established and expanded. At the same time, the transformation could combat inequality and promote Inclusion within societies and globally, thus becoming an equity project.\n\n====Climate Protection as a World Citizen Movement (2014)<ref name=\"Special Report 2014\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2014-climate-protection/ Special report 2014], \u201eClimate Protection as a World Citizen Movement\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes it unmistakably clear: unacceptable climatic consequences, which are likely to escalate beyond the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C guard rail, can only be avoided if further increases in greenhouse-gas concentrations are halted as soon as possible. The WBGU therefore recommends reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuels to zero by 2070 at the latest. This policy goal is both ambitious and incisive, because 'the zero target must be reached' by every country, every municipality, every company and every citizen if the world as a whole is to become climate-neutral. However, the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C line can only be held if a large proportion of stakeholders \u2013 especially the OECD countries \u2013 start reducing their emissions much earlier. Global society as a whole has only a very limited carbon budget at its disposal; emissions should therefore peak by 2020 if possible, or in the third decade at the latest. In this report the WBGU outlines a two-pronged strategy for global climate protection based on interaction between multilateralism and civil society. To achieve this, on the one hand the Paris Climate Agreement targeted for late 2015 should exhibit certain characteristics set out by the WBGU. In particular, a process should be agreed to ensure compliance with the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C guard rail. On the other hand, all social actors should make their specific contributions towards decarbonization. In this way, an intricate responsibility architecture for the future of our planet can emerge in which vertical delegating and horizontal engagement are not contradictions, but complementary factors that reinforce each other.\n\n====Solving the climate dilemma: The budget approach (2009)<ref name=\"Special Report 2009\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2009-budget-approach/ Special report 2009], \u201eSolving the climate dilemma: The budget approach.\u201c</ref>====\n\nAt their meeting in the Italian city of L\u2019Aquila in July 2009, the heads of state and governments of the G8 countries and the [[Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate]] (MEF), whose members include India, Brazil and China, acknowledged the importance that [[global warming]] must not exceed the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C guard rail if dangerous climate change is to be avoided. WBGU views this as an extremely important step towards the adoption of a binding international agreement which establishes a well-founded target for global climate protection. The task now is to build on this consensus and reach agreement, at [[Copenhagen]], on a follow-up treaty to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which is due to expire in 2012. This new international agreement should translate the relevant scientific knowledge into a fair and practicable global strategy to combat global warming. So far, however, the lack of unanimity between the countries involved in the negotiating process has meant that there is no clear leitmotif pointing the way towards such an agreement.\n\n====The Future Oceans: Warming Up, Rising High, Turning Sour (2006)<ref name=\"Special report 2006\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2006-the-future-oceans/ Special report 2006], \u201eThe Future Oceans \u2013 Warming Up, Rising High, Turning Sour.\u201c</ref>====\nLatest research findings show that failure to check mankind's emissions of carbon dioxide will have severe consequences for the world's oceans. The marine environment is doubly affected: continuing warming and ongoing acidification both pose threats. In combination with over-fishing, these two threats are further jeopardizing already weakened fish stocks. Sea-level rise is exposing coastal regions to mounting flood and hurricane risks. To keep the adverse effects on human society and ecosystems within manageable limits, it will be essential to adopt new coastal protection approaches, designate marine protected areas and agree on ways to deal with refugees from endangered coastal areas. All such measures, however, can only succeed if global warming and ocean acidification are combated vigorously. Ambitious climate protection is therefore a key precondition to successful marine conservation and coastal protection.\n\n====Climate Protection Strategies for the 21st Century. Kyoto and Beyond (2003)<ref name=\"Special report 2003\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2003-kyoto-and-beyond/ Special report 2003], \u201eClimate Protection Strategies for the 21st Century. Kyoto and Beyond.\u201c</ref>====\nWith this special report, the WBGU provides recommendations for future negotiations within the context of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), particularly relating to the Kyoto Protocol to the Convention. The report centres on three questions:\n*What is \u2018dangerous climate change\u2019 within the meaning of Article 2 of the UNFCCC?\n*Which socio-economically and technologically viable pathways are available to prevent such dangerous climate change?\n*How can all countries be integrated equitably within a system of emissions reduction commitments?\nThe report concentrates on the potentials to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide, this being the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas. The analysis focuses, on the one hand, on the economic and technological potentials to reduce energy and industry related emissions and, on the other hand, on the relevance of biological sinks of carbon dioxide and the options to preserve them. Finally, based on this analysis, the report contains specific recommendations on ways to shape political and economic instruments in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n====Charging the Use of Global Commons (2002)<ref name=\"Special report 2002\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2002-charging-the-use/ Special report 2002], \u201eCharging the Use of Global Commons.\u201c</ref>====\nGlobal common resources like international airspace and the high seas are in danger of overexploitation because the users need not bear the full social costs of their actions. The CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions of international aviation and of shipping are not subject to the quantitative reduction obligations of the Kyoto Protocol. Imposing user charges can close this regulatory gap and induce environment-related incentive effects to reduce environmental damage. Moreover, additional financial resources are generated, which should be earmarked for the protection and conservation of global common goods. In this special report, the WBGU makes recommendations for a politically viable implementation of the concept of global user charges for three specific areas of application:\n*   Charges on the use of airspace by aviation,\n*   Charges on the use of the oceans by shipping,\n*   Payments for non utilisation obligations.\n\n====Environment and Ethics (1999)<ref name=\"Special report 1999\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1999-environment-and-ethics/ Special report 1999], \u201eEnvironment and Ethics.\u201c</ref>====\nShould people be allowed to do everything they want? Should humankind be allowed to use nature and the environment completely for its own ends? More and more people are questioning the limits of human intervention in nature. What is ethically allowed and what should be prohibited? The WBGU offers some answers to these difficult questions. At the same time it has drawn up a number of principles, which should not be violated, even where there are big economical gains. In addition, in a democratic and culturally diverse society it is the task of ethics to lay down generally binding criteria for balancing between nature-related and, for example, economic matters. With these tools of ethical and economic criteria the [[Federal Government of Germany]] could support the interests of environmental protection at the international level.\n\n====The Accounting of Biological Sinks and Sources Under the Kyoto Protocol: A Step Forwards or Backwards for Global Environmental Protection? (1998)<ref name=\"Special report 1998\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1998-kyoto/ Special report 1998], \u201eThe Accounting of Biological Sinks and Sources Under the Kyoto Protocol: A Step Forwards or Backwards for Global Environmental Protection?.\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe WBGU assesses the Kyoto Protocol with respect to the accounting of biological sources and sinks. In principle, the WBGU supports the idea of linking climate protection and the conservation of sinks. However, the WBGU considers the form in which biological sources and sinks are accounted in the Kyoto Protocol to be inadequate and in need of improvement if the objectives of climate protection and biodiversity conservation are both to be served. The present accounting approach can lead to incentives with negative impacts upon climate protection, biodiversity conservation and soil protection. In addition, many uncertainties and imponderables attach to the reduction in net emissions that is achievable by means of terrestrial sinks. Even slight climate changes can lead to sinks becoming sources. Over the long run, fossil fuel emissions can not be compensated for by the terrestrial biosphere. The WBGU analyses the provisions of the Kyoto-Protocol and presents the state of knowledge on the source and sink potentials of terrestrial ecosystems and on the existing uncertainties and unresolved issues. This forms the basis for an assessment of the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol as well as for recommendations for the interpretation and concrete application of these provisions.\n\n====Targets for Climate Protection 1997<ref name=\"Special report 1997\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1997-climate-protection/ Special report 1997], \u201eTargets for Climate Protection.\u201c</ref>====\nThis statement was issued on the occasion of the Third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Climate Convention, FCCC), and contains recommendations on the commitments to be agreed upon in a protocol to the Convention. According to the \"Berlin Mandate\" adopted at the first Conference of the Parties, the commitments of the industrialized countries listed in Annex I of the Climate Convention are to be strengthened by setting quantified limitation and reduction objectives within specified time frames for their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These measures are aimed at achieving the ultimate objective of the FCCC, namely a \"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\".\n\n====Scenario for the derivation of global CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction targets and implementation strategies (1995)<ref name=\"Special report 1995\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1995-co2-reduction/ Special report 1995], \u201eScenario for the derivation of global CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction targets and implementation strategies.\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe WBGU derives a global CO<sub>2</sub> reduction target by using an \"inverse scenario\" based on simplified models for climate dynamics and [[The Carbon Cycle|the carbon cycle]]. By first analysing the maximum stress levels caused by climate change that one can assume to be ecologically and economically bearable, a \"tolerance window\" for the future climatic development is deduced. In a further step, the set of admissible emission profiles is determined, i.e., those global CO<sub>2</sub> emission functions which keep the climate system within the demarcated window. Among the so-defined family of emission options a specific strategy is finally singled out by feasibility criteria. The WBGU believes that such an integrated assessment of the climate change problem in the \"backwards mode\" has several advantages in comparison with the straightforward approach. It has to be emphasised, however, that the analysis employs a number of assumptions and approximations and therefore has the character of a \"[[Gedankenexperiment]]\".\n\n===Policy Papers===\n\n====A European Way to our Common Digital Future<ref name=\"Policy Paper 11, 2019\">[https://www.wbgu.de/en/publications/publication/pp11-2019 Policy Paper 11, 2019], \u201eA European Way to our Common Digital Future\u201c</ref>====\nParticularly during its presidency of the Council of the EU in 2020, Germany should build upon the Green Deal announced by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and work towards a close integration of digital change and sustainability. The new EU Parliament and the new European Commission should also pursue this goal. To this end the WBGU presents 7 cornerstones of a European way to a common digital future:\n\n# Integrate the opportunities and risks of digitalization into EU sustainability policy: The EU needs an implementation strategy for the SDGs that also places digital technologies at the service of sustainability and addresses its risks. In the same way, digitalization should be embedded in the 8th Environmental Action Programme from 2021 onwards. \n# Actively shape digital policy in line with sustainability goals: Ecological and social aimsthat can be reached through digitalization shouldbe pursued with equal emphasis, e.g. via the European Digital Agenda, the European Commission\u2019s Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (AI), or measures within the framework of the Digital Europe programme. Negative (side) effects should be identified and minimized at an early stage.\n# Involve the private sector more in the provision of data: Up to now, EU data policy has concentrated on the protection of personal data and the use of data from public authorities. This does not go far enough: accessibility to, and the re-use of (non-personal) private-sector data should also be improved in order to create data that can be used for the common good and digitalized (knowledge) assets. \n# Develop and apply artificial intelligence in a sustainable way: The EU should be consistent in following its value-based approach in the application and development of AI systems: fundamental rights, human dignity, environmental and sustainability principles are the normative foundation of the EU and non-negotiable. There is an urgent need for (framework) legislation on the development and handling of AI, since ethical guidelines and debates alone are not enough to ensure a corresponding development and application. In addition, research on explainable and secure, i.e. reliably verified and validated, AI should be promoted and used to ensure trustworthy, fair and accountable procedures.\n# Ensure access to digital commons and basic services through public-service information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures: Individual inclusion, personal development, environmental protection, fair competition and a functioning digital public sphere require access to data and services such as cloud services, mobility platforms or a search index. Their almost exclusively private-sector provision is not always in the interests of the common good. The EU\u2019s task should be to create or ensure public-service digital and digitalized infrastructures to make data and information accessible for the common good and to offer alternative (basic) services under public law.\n# Gear EU research policy and promotion of innovations consistently towards sustainability goals: Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) should be applied as an overarching concept of European research and innovation policy in order to explicitly embed the orientation towards sustainability goals and to avoid unintended impacts. The high levels of protection of the environment, consumers and occupational health and safety in the EU must not be weakened by the innovation principle currently under discussion. Horizon Europe\u2019s missions should aim to integrate digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability and strengthen transformative and transformation research. \n# European digitalization model as a priority in foreign policy: The EU should also promote the integration of sustainability and digitalization internationally. It should initiate a summit on \u2018Sustainability in the Digital Age\u2019, e.g. for 2022, symbolically 30 years after the Earth Summit in Rio, to set the course for the necessary continuation of the sustainability agenda until 2030 and beyond.\n\n====Digital Momentum for the UN Sustainability Agenda in the 21st Century<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2019\">[https://www.wbgu.de/en/publications/publication/pp10-2019 Policy Paper 2019], \u201eDigital Momentum for the UN Sustainability Agenda in the 21st Century\u201c</ref>====\n\nGlobal digital change should be designed to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Up to now, hopes that digitalization would make a contribution to achieving these goals has not materialized. Only if digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability are constructively interlinked can we make progress with environmental protection, climate-change mitigation and human development. The WBGU would like to introduce into the discussion four ideas directly related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). First: promote a global (environmental) awareness among people worldwide by providing a stronger future-proof education. The focus should be on enabling people to actively shape digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability. Open data relating to sustainability and virtual learning environments are important elements for experiencing ecosystems. In concrete terms, an integrated programme for future-proof education should be developed, UN processes should be opened up to citizen-science projects, and an International Information Union should be founded to collect, process and publish sustainability-related data. Second, establish a digitally enhanced circular economy. The transition from linear and resource-intensive value chains to a near-complete circular economy is a key component of the Transformation towards Sustainability. Digital data acquisition and processing offer great potential for this. Environmentally harmful emissions and resource depletion should be recorded across all sectors of the economy and value chains, and greater efforts should be made to implement the 3Rs strategy (reduce, reuse, recycle) at the international level. Third, modernize sustainability policy itself by using digital solutions. Digitally enhanced governance can help improve the transparency of political actions, as well as the participation and worldwide networking of political actors. Coordination within the UN system should be intensified by establishing a 'UN Digitalization Initiative'; a 'UN Framework Convention on Digital Sustainability and Sustainable Digitalization' should be negotiated; and a globally uniform set of indicators for the SDGs should be developed to facilitate the comparability and verifiability of national reports. Fourth, further develop the global sustainability agenda beyond 2030 against the background of the opportunities and risks of the Digital Age. The UN should prepare for these future challenges in good time. The WBGU recommends convening a UN summit on 'Sustainability in the Digital Age' in 2022 \u2013 30 years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro \u2013 to set the course for continuing the sustainability agenda beyond 2030. A key outcome could be the adoption of a charter entitled 'Towards Our Common Digital Future'.\n\n====Just & In\u2013Time Climate Policy: Four Initiatives for Fairness (2018){{nnbsp}}<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2018\">{{cite book\n | author = WBGU\n | title = Just & in-time climate policy: four initiatives for a fair transformation \u2014 Policy paper 9\n | date = 20 July 2018\n | publisher = Scientific Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU)\n | location = Berlin, Germany\n | isbn = 978-3-936191-86-8\n | url = https://www.wbgu.de/fileadmin/user_upload/wbgu.de/templates/dateien/veroeffentlichungen/politikpapiere/pp2018-pp9/wbgu_policypaper_9.pdf\n | access-date = 2018-12-02\n}}  Translation from German.\n</ref>====\nLimiting global warming to well below 2&nbsp;\u00b0C requires the rapid decarbonization of the global economy. If this enterprise fails, we will jeopardize the life-support systems of future generations. The longer the transformation towards climate compatibility is delayed, the more severe the risks and damage will be for a growing number of people. The transformation requirements and the damage caused by climate change have an unequal temporal, geographical and social distribution \u2013 as do the respective possibilities for dealing with them. The WBGU therefore proposes a just & in-time transformation that takes into account all people affected, empowers them, holds those responsible for climate change accountable, and creates both global and national prospects for the future. The WBGU proposes that the German Federal Government should promote four exemplary initiatives of a just & in-time climate policy targeting (1) the people affected by the structural change towards climate compatibility (e.g. in coal-mining regions), (2) the legal rights of people harmed by climate change, (3) the dignified migration of people who lose their native countries due to climate change, and (4) the creation of financing instruments for just & in-time transformation processes.\n\n====Human progress within planetary guard rails. A contribution to the SDG debate (2014)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2014\">[https://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-8-2014-sdg/ Policy Paper 2014], \u201eHuman progress within planetary guard rails. A contribution to the SDG debate\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe year 2015 has special importance for the transformation towards sustainable development. New Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are then supposed to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The aim is to offer a new orientation for political action in the coming decades. The WBGU recommends orienting the new catalogue of goals towards the key message of the 1992 Earth Summit: that development and environmental protection must be considered together and do not contradict each other. The SDGs should not be reduced to poverty eradication, but must address all dimensions of sustainable development. In particular, global environmental change must be incorporated, otherwise even poverty eradication will become impossible. Up to now, too little attention has been paid to this link in the ongoing discourse on SDGs. Although many reports mention the concept of planetary guard rails or planetary boundaries, they do not back this up with specific targets. The WBGU presents recommendations on how guard rails for global environmental problems should be incorporated in the SDG catalogue and operationalized by means of corresponding targets.\n\n====Financing the Global Energy-System Transformation (2012)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2012\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policypaper-7/ Policy Paper 2012], \u201eFinancing the Global Energy System Transformation\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe world faces the challenge of a global transformation to sustainable energy systems. Substantial up-front investments are needed to improve energy efficiency and switch to renewable energies. At the same time, these investments offer great opportunities, because strategic innovations can be triggered and new markets can develop in the course of the transformation process. Savings on the cost of fossil fuels in conventional technologies could completely offset the investment in renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency by as early as 2040. The private capital needed for the transformation is available and can be mobilised if a suitable political framework is put into place. A corresponding regulatory policy should be introduced to make such investment more attractive for the private sector. The WBGU advocates a proactive state that integrates energy, environmental and climate policy; this could reduce existing investment risks by developing a stable, long-term transformative regulatory framework. At the same time, policy makers should expand the opportunities for participation. Germany is currently leading this transformation, both in terms of technological innovations and in the creation of a suitable policy framework. Our country is able to give the world an example of how the [[Energiewende]] (energy-system transformation) can generate more, not less prosperity.\n\n====Climate Policy Post-Copenhagen: A Three-Level Strategy for Success (2010)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2010\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policypaper-6/ Policy Paper 2010], \u201eClimate policy post-Copenhagen: Action at three levels offers prospect of success.\u201c</ref>====\n\nInternational climate policy post-Copenhagen is in crisis. There is currently no prospect of the comprehensive and binding UN climate treaty \u2013 the outcome hoped for at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference \u2013 being achieved within the foreseeable future. However, in order to keep the global mean temperature rise below 2&nbsp;\u00b0C by the end of the century, a resolute course must be set in the international climate process within the next few years. The WBGU recommends that in order to revitalise the multilateral climate process, policy-makers and civil society in Europe take on a self-confident leading role in global alliances with selected \u2018climate pioneer\u2019 countries and that more intensive support be provided for civil society initiatives. The aim of establishing a binding international regime to limit CO<sub>2</sub> emissions \u2013 based, for example, on the WBGU's own budget approach and similar approaches now also being discussed in China and India \u2013 must remain in place. The following recommendations are directed primarily towards the German Government in light of its role in the international arena, particularly within [[the European Union]] (EU), at intergovernmental level via its bilateral and multilateral cooperation, and in the United Nations context.\n\n====New impetus for climate policy: Making the most of Germany's dual presidency (2007)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2007\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-5/ Policy Paper 2007], \u201eNew impetus for climate policy: Making the most of Germany's dual presidency.\u201c</ref>====\n\nIf dangerous climate change is still to be avoided, a reversal of current trends must be achieved within the next ten years, and greenhouse gas emissions worldwide must be halved by 2050 compared with a 1990 baseline. However, there is a widening gap between the action that is urgently needed and current climate policy. The WBGU is therefore convinced that a new climate policy dynamic is required worldwide and that Germany's double presidency of the European Union and P of G8 offers a dual opportunity to drive climate protection forward. The WBGU's core messages are:\n*Climate protection is both worthwhile and feasible: Investing in climate protection is economically efficient, as the costs of effective climate protection are far lower than the costs of inaction.\n*Further development of the UN climate convention: A consensus on the mitigation target must be forged and enshrined in the convention. To this end, the WBGU recommends the adoption of a global temperature guard rail limiting the rise in near-surface air temperature to a maximum of 2&nbsp;\u00b0C relative to the pre-industrial value \u2013 equivalent to stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases below 450 ppm CO2eq.\n*Making the most of the G8 Summit at Heiligendamm: Fresh initiatives from the heads of state and government are required to inject new life into the faltering climate process.\n*Reaffirming the European Union's leading role: The European Union should expand its leading role in international climate protection.\n\n====Development needs Environmental Protection: Recommendations for the Millennium + 5 Summit (2005)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2005\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-4/ Policy Paper 2005], \u201eDevelopment needs Environmental Protection: Recommendations for the Millennium + 5 Summit.\u201c</ref>====\nThe Millennium + 5 Summit will review progress towards the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) and take stock of the United Nations' capacity to act. The Summit offers the opportunity to set a new course in international poverty reduction and initiate a reform of the UN. If the MDGs fail, international cooperation will be plunged into crisis. Yet the current poverty debate tends to overlook the environmental problems which exacerbate poverty in many developing countries. The international community should therefore remind itself of the message sent out by the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992: environmental and development policies are inextricably linked. WBGU's core recommendations are:\n*Linking poverty reduction with environmental policy: The MDGs cannot be achieved without environmental protection measures. Environmental policy is therefore a prerequisite for development and must be a key element in any long-term poverty reduction strategy. Conversely, the global environment cannot be protected without development policy.\n*Forging strategic partnerships with anchor countries: Due to their size and dynamic economies, developing countries such as China, Brazil and India play a key role both in global environmental changes and in poverty reduction. The strategic foci of development cooperation with these countries must be placed accordingly.\n*Reforming the development and environment policy architecture: The division of labour in international development policy should be improved and the fragmentation of the multilateral development and environment institutions overcome. In the medium term, a new Council on Global Development and Environment should replace the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).\n*Increasing the funding commitments: The international community should invest more intensively in poverty reduction and environmental protection: the costs of inaction would be significantly higher. As well as increasing funds committed to development cooperation, new financing instruments, such as charges for the use of global common goods, should be introduced.\n\n====Renewable energies for sustainable development: Impulses for renewables 2004<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2004\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-3/ Policy Paper 2004], \u201eRenewable energies for sustainable development: Impulses for renewables.\u201c</ref>====\n\nEnergy is a key theme for future world development. Worldwide energy demand is mounting rapidly, particularly in the developing and newly industrialising countries, which seek to catch up with the level of economic development attained by industrialised countries. The great challenge now is to meet this energy demand in a sustainable manner. However, sustainable development will be inconceivable without a deep-seated reconfiguration of worldwide energy systems. One goal in this context must be to protect natural life-support systems and, in particular, to prevent dangerous anthropogenic perturbation of the climate system. If the present path continues and rising energy demand is met mainly from fossil sources, this would trigger intolerable global climate change with high consequential costs, and would thus also jeopardize economic development. A second necessary goal is to eradicate energy poverty in developing countries in order that these countries can make use of development opportunities. It is essential that 2.4&nbsp;billion people gain access to modern forms of energy so that they can shake off the yoke of energy poverty. To attain these two goals, energy systems need to be turned towards sustainability. To that end, efficiency must be improved at all levels of the energy system, and fossil energy sources must be substituted by renewable ones. The potential of renewable energies, above all solar energy, is almost unlimited and can be harnessed sustainably. Energy system transformation towards sustainability is thus the first step into the solar age. However, without rapid and resolute international policy support, the expansion of renewable energy sources will not be able to develop the necessary dynamics in time. The International Conference for Renewable Energies (renewables 2004) held in Bonn 2004 is a milestone for this process.\n\n====Charging the Use of Global Commons (2002)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2002\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-2/ Policy Paper 2002], \u201eCharging the Use of Global Commons.\u201c</ref>====\nIn this policy paper, the WBGU summarizes the key findings of its special report on user charges within the framework of global sustainability policy, and makes recommendations for a politically viable implementation of the concept of global user charges for three specific areas of application:\n*  Charges on the use of airspace by aviation,\n*  Charges on the use of the oceans by shipping,\n*  Payments for non utilization obligations.\n\n====The Johannesburg Opportunity: Key Elements of a Negotiation Strategy (2001)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2001\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-1/ Policy Paper 2001], \u201eThe Johannesburg Opportunity: Key Elements of a Negotiation Strategy.\u201c</ref>====\nJohannesburg in South Africa is a symbolically important venue for the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD). No other continent has been affected worse by the impacts of global change and exhibits in such representative form the critical environmental and socioeconomic situation facing many developing countries. At the same time, the host nation epitomizes new hopes and beginnings following the radical changes it has undergone in recent years. A new beginning is necessary at the international level, too, given the further deterioration in the state of the global environment since the 1992 [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro. New problems have arisen and the most critical remain unsolved. The WSSD to be held in September 2002 in Johannesburg provides the international community with yet another opportunity to set the future direction of international environment and development policy. In the run-up to this event, the WBGU would like to focus the attention of the Federal Government of Germany on some crucial issues where decisions in Johannesburg could help to eliminate critical shortcomings in current environment and development policy. A great deal has been achieved in the field of global environmental policymaking since 1992, in particular the international conventions and treaties dealing with a range of global environmental problems such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, desertification, or the impacts of persistent organic pollutants. In the view of the WBGU, the Johannesburg summit should therefore refrain from detailed negotiations on these topics. However, it must be possible to provide new ideas and inspiration, to close gaps and loopholes, and to take the various conventions a stage further\n\n== Quotes about WBGU reports ==\n\n\"The reports of the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) are an indispensable reference and resource on global environmental change policies. Every scientist, decision-maker and institution concerned with the pressing issue of environment and development should have them.\"\n\nProf. Dr. [[Klaus T\u00f6pfer]], Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) 1998-2006\n\n\"Humanity on the move: Unlocking the transformative power of cities, is a notable breath of fresh air at a time when shallow platitudes seem the order of the day. It is bold, meticulously crafted through argument (as opposed to assertion) and evidence, and rooted in a highly original conceptual framework that is both global in scope and differentiated. The report asserts the centrality of cultural and institutional change and does not shy away from being specific and programmatic at a moment when it seems that political discourses are increasingly disconnected from our highly fractious, unsustainable, violent and intolerant times. I recommend it as compulsory reading in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\nProfessor [[Edgar Pieterse]], Director \u2013 African Centre for Cities (University of Cape Town) & Chairperson of the Cities Alliance Think Tank.\n\n\u201eThe new WBGU-Study \u201eA Social Contract for Sustainability\u201d appears at a time in which people around the world are increasingly committed to creating a future that is both sustainable and climate-safe. The study shows that such a future will only be possible if governments, business and  civil society collectively set the right course, making the most of regional, national and global cooperation. An important call to cross-cutting integrated action, the book deserves wide recognition.\u201c\n\n[[Christiana Figueres]], Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (2010-2016)\n\n\"The geopolitical world is changing beyond recognition. The challenge of ensuring that in the future people can live better than today, while doing so within the Planetary Boundaries has yet to be met.  Markets and the environment are increasingly globalized.  Social protection and the search for equity are not, though there are interesting signs of change.  There are many international institutions, but few are global.  We have known for some time the necessary individual solutions required for the transition.  Now, the WBGU report `World in Transition \u2013 A Social Contract for Sustainability\u00b4 offers us extremely interesting ideas on how we can bring all this together collectively through a new social contract that is global, equitable and green, and requires a new kind of global citizenship: the first steps toward a global political project for global sustainability.\"\n\n[[Janos Pasztor]], Executive Secretary UN Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Global Sustainability 2010-12\n\n\u201cThe `World in Transition \u2013 Governing the Marine Heritage\u00b4 report presents a thought provoking look at crucial aspects of oceans governance. It resonates strongly with our thinking in the World Bank and among the partners of the Global Partnership for Oceans. Nation states, civil society and industry need to work together to support more sustainable and productive ocean use. This report makes a valuable contribution to global thinking on how best we might secure a sustainable future from healthy oceans.\u201d\n\n[[Rachel Kyte]], Vice President, Sustainable Development, The World Bank (2014-2015)\n\n\"Biofuels have been represented by some as a silver bullet to the climate change threat, and by others as a fatal mistake set to destroy forests and increase hunger; they are neither. Sane and sensibly developed they offer a chance to reduce emissions, generate employment and diversify rural livelihoods. But widespread commercialisation without proper sustainability standards could prove a disaster, causing more environmental and human harm than good. The new WBGU report shows that a sustainable use of bioenergy is possible and outlines how opportunities can be exploited while at the same time minimizing risks. The report thus offers policy-makers valuable guidance for a sustainable bioenergy policy.\"\n\n[[Achim Steiner]], Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2006-2016)\n\n\"With Climate Change as a Security Risk, WBGU has compiled a flagship report on an issue that quite rightly is rising rapidly up the international political agenda. The authors pull no punches on the likelihood of increasing tensions and conflicts in a climatically constrained world and spotlight places where possible conflicts may flare up in the 21st century unless climate change is checked. The report makes it clear that climate policy is preventative security policy.\"\n\n[[Achim Steiner]], Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2006-2016)\n\n\u201eWith its interdisciplinary approach, providing a complex and systematic analysis of the poverty-environment nexus, WBGU's latest report breaks new ground. Indira Gandhi's old, convenient maxim was 'Poverty is the biggest polluter'. Put forward at the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, it has been sorely misused ever since to override environmental precaution and prioritize economic development strategies instead. The new WBGU report maps out a way to shape a coherent environment and development policy. This report revitalizes the Rio spirit and gives it a robust scientific base\u201c\n\n[[Ernst Ulrich von Weizs\u00e4cker]], Member of the German Bundestag 1998-2005.\n\n\"The publication of 'World in Transition: Towards Sustainable Energy Systems' is timely indeed. The World Summit on Sustainable Development gave great attention to this challenge, but failed to agree on a quantitative, time-bound target for the introduction of renewable energy sources. The German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) has now produced a report with a global focus; this is essential in view of the global impacts of climatic changes. The report provides a convincing long-term analysis; this, too, is essential, for global energy policies must take a long-term perspective, over a time frame of 50 to 100 years, while providing concrete guidance for decision makers to be implemented now. There is an urgent need to identify paths by which to secure energy supply for the 2.4 billion people who still depend upon traditional biomass, while keeping clearly in view the need to combine this challenge with the prevention of perilous climatic changes. Our one world must close the gap between industrialized countries\u2019 surfeit and developing countries\u2019 poverty. Policies will need to consider both the broader environmental and specific climate exigencies. I recommend this book very warmly to everyone concerned with global energy issues.\"\n\n[[Klaus T\u00f6pfer]], Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) from 1998-2006.\n\n==Public Relations and Events (Selection)==\nIn May 2012, WBGU hosted  a high-level international Symposium \u201eTowards Low-Carbon Prosperity: National Strategies and International Partnerships\u201c in Berlin.

The Council's principal tasks are to:\n\n* analyse global environment and development problems and report on these, \n* review and evaluate national and international research in the field of global change,\n* provide early warning of new issue areas,\n* identify gaps in research and to initiate new research,\n* monitor and assess national and international policies for the achievement of sustainable development,\n* elaborate recommendations for action and research and\n* raise public awareness and heighten the media profile of global change issues.\n\nThe WBGU also comments on current events, such as the [[United Nations Climate Change conference]]s (e.g., in Paris 2015), the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (Rio+20), the adoption of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (2015),<ref>http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-8-2014-sdg/</ref> the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development [[Habitat III]]<ref>http://www.wbgu.de/fileadmin/templates/dateien/veroeffentlichungen/weitere/statement_habitat_2016.pdf</ref> (2016) or Germany's [[G20]] presidency in 2017.<ref>http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2016-g20/</ref>\n\n==Reports==\n\n===Flagship Reports===\n\n====Towards our Common Digital Future (2019)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/fr2019 Flagship report 2019], \u201eTowards our Common Digital Future\u201c</ref>====\nWithout creative political action, digital change will further accelerate resource and energy consumption, and exacerbate damage to the environment and the climate. It is therefore an urgent political task to create the conditions needed to place digitalization at the service of sustainable development; this is one of the key messages of the report \"Towards our Common Digital Future\" [LINK]. In the short term, the aim is to harmonize digitalization with the global sustainability goals agreed in 2015 (SDGs, Agenda 2030) and the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. New technologies should be used specifically and comprehensively to give people access to basic services such as healthcare, education, energy and (environmental) information and to prevent environmental degradation. Examples include promoting the energy-system transformation using intelligent energy networks, reducing vehicular traffic in cities by means of shared mobility (which makes owning a car superfluous), and using digital technologies to promote a [[circular economy]]. In addition, precautions must already be taken today to deal with the profound societal upheavals that will accompany digitalization in the medium term. Examples include the foreseeable radical structural change on the labour markets, the replacement of real-world experiences in virtual spaces, the manifold impacts of artificial intelligence on education, science and democracy, and the challenge of democratically restricting the surveillance potential of new technologies. According to the WBGU's new report, all digital changes should be geared towards the common good and improving people's quality of life. Finally, another issue is preparing for possible long-term upheavals. For example, in human-machine interaction, risks to human integrity are already recognizable today. This concerns, for example, sensitive neuro-data or neuro-prostheses, whose ethical aspects have been insufficiently taken into account up to now. In the age of digitalization, it is necessary to redefine our understanding of 'human development\u2018.\n\n====Humanity on the move: The transformative power of cities (2016)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2016-urbanization/ Flagship report 2016], \u201eHumanity on the move: The transformative power of cities\u201c</ref>====\nThe momentum of urbanization and its impacts are so massive that we must face up to this trend. In view of the existing cognitive, technical, economic and institutional path dependencies, a policy of business as usual \u2013 i.e. an unstructured, quasi-automatic urbanization \u2013 would lead to a non-sustainable \u2018world cities society\u2019. Only if cities and urban societies are sufficiently empowered can they make use of the opportunities for sustainability and successfully follow the urban transformation pathways. The success or failure of the Great Transformation will be decided in the cities. The WBGU discusses the relevant conditions for the success of this transformation in this report.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Governing the Marine Heritage (2013)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2013-oceans/ Flagship report 2013], \u201eWorld in Transition: Governing the Marine Heritage.\u201c</ref>====\nDespite numerous international treaties and voluntary commitments, the seas are still being massively overfished, polluted and increasingly exploited as the Earth's last resort. In view of the oceans\u2019 poor condition, the WBGU developed a long-term vision of the conservation and sustainable use of the blue continent: All marine zones with the exception of territorial waters should be declared as common heritage of mankind. In order to move closer to this ultimate goal for [[ocean governance]], the WBGU also gives recommendations for action that link up with ongoing political processes, especially for two focal themes: food ([[sustainable fisheries]] and [[aquaculture]]) and energy from the sea. The report shows that sustainable stewardship of the oceans is urgently necessary, that the seas can be incorporated into a transformation towards a low-carbon, sustainable society, and that such a transformation can achieve substantial benefits worldwide both for a sustainable energy supply and for food security.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 A Social Contract for Sustainability (2011)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/wbgu_jg2011_en/ Flagship report 2011], \u201eWorld in Transition: A Social Contract for Sustainability.\u201c</ref>====\n\nIn this report, the WBGU explains the reasons for the desperate need for a post-fossil economic strategy, yet it also concludes that the transition to sustainability is achievable, and presents ten concrete packages of measures to accelerate the imperative restructuring. If the transformation really is to succeed, we have to enter into a social contract for innovation, in the form of a new kind of discourse between governments and citizens, both within and beyond the boundaries of the nation state.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Future Bioenergy and Sustainable Land Use (2008)<ref>[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2008-bioenergy/ Flagship report 2008], \u201eWorld in Transition: Future Bioenergy and Sustainable Land Use.\u201c</ref>====\nIn view of the major opportunities and risks associated with it, and the complexity of the subject, bioenergy policy has in a short time become a challenging political task for regulators and planners \u2013 a task which can only be accomplished through worldwide cooperation and the creation of an international framework. WBGU's central message is that use should be made of the sustainable potential of bioenergy which can be tapped all over the world, provided that risks to sustainability are excluded. In particular, the use of bioenergy must not endanger food security or the goals of nature conservation and climate change mitigation.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013  Climate Change as a Security Risk (2007)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2007\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2007-security/ Flagship report 2007] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216130144/http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2007-security/ |date=2017-12-16 }}, \u201eWorld in Transition: Climate Change as a Security Risk.\u201c</ref>====\nWithout resolute counteraction, climate change will overstretch many societies\u2019 adaptive capacities within the coming decades. This could result in destabilization and violence, jeopardizing national and international security to a new degree. However, climate change could also unite the international community, provided that it recognizes climate change as a threat to humankind and soon sets the course for the avoidance of dangerous anthropogenic climate change by adopting a dynamic and globally coordinated climate policy. If it fails to do so, climate change will draw ever-deeper lines of division and conflict in international relations, triggering numerous conflicts between and within countries over the distribution of resources, especially water and land, over the management of migration, or over compensation payments between the countries mainly responsible for climate change and those countries most affected by its destructive effects. That is the backdrop against which WBGU, in this flagship report, summarizes the state-of-the-art of science on the subject of \u201cClimate Change as a Security Risk\u201d. It is based on the findings of research into environmental conflicts, the causes of war, and of climate impact research. It appraises past experience but also ventures to cast a glance far into the future in order to assess the likely impacts of climate change on societies, nation-states, regions and the international system.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Fighting Poverty through Environmental Policy (2004)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2004\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2004-poverty/ Flagship report 2004], \u201eWorld in Transition: Fighting Poverty through Environmental Policy.\u201c</ref>====\nAt the start of the 21st century, fighting poverty and protecting the environment are two of the most urgent challenges facing the international community. Narrowing the massive disparities in the satisfaction of basic needs and distribution of prosperity must be a primary objective. Extreme poverty, such as that prevailing above all in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] and South Asia, is the most obvious manifestation of the untenable imbalance in the world's social system. The recommendations for action set out in this report are based on an analysis of the systemic links between poverty (income poverty, disease, malnutrition, and lack of education, social stability and social capital) and environmental changes (climate change, lack of water resources, [[water pollution]], [[soil degradation]], loss of [[biological diversity]] and resources, and air pollution). The manifestations of and interactions between poverty and environmental problems are investigated in their various forms. This type of integrated analysis is nothing new; what is new, however, is the consistent linking of a holistic approach with the following key questions: which institutional arrangements offer ways of coping with these problems, and where must gaps be closed? To this end, WBGU has evaluated major international political processes and developed recommendations on policy coherence. It also presents various recommendations on further research to identify the strategic gaps in theoretical and practical knowledge.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Towards Sustainable Energy Systems (2003)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2003\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2003-energy/ Flagship report 2003], \u201eWorld in Transition: Towards Sustainable Energy Systems.\u201c</ref>====\nThe report underscores the urgent need to transform global energy systems so that the world's population has access to energy based on renewable sources. This is necessary in order to protect the global climate and to liberate 2.4&nbsp;billion people in developing countries from energy poverty. Such an approach would also yield a peace dividend by reducing dependence upon regionally concentrated oil reserves. The scientists stress that such a reconfiguration of energy systems is feasible and fundable if rapid and resolute action is taken in the coming two decades. To this end, they propose a roadmap with specific milestones.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 New Structures for Global Environmental Policy (2000)<ref name=\"Flagship report 2001\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-2000-institutions/ Flagship report 2000], \u201eWorld in Transition: New Structures for Global Environmental Policy.\u201c</ref>====\nToday, more than 900 bi- and multilateral environmental treaties are in force. Nonetheless, the most pressing problems of global change remain unresolved, some are even intensifying. The international institutional and organisational architecture has proven too weak to provide effective and efficient responses to these challenges. In this situation, the WBGU has developed a vision for reforming the United Nations in the environmental arena. It terms this the \u2018Earth Alliance\u2019, comprising three interlocking realms. First, to provide authority in the assessment of environmental problems, the WBGU proposes establishing an independent body whose task is to provide timely warning of particularly risk-laden developments in the sphere of global change \u2013 Earth Assessment. Second, the report gives recommendations for redesigning the organisational core of global environmental policy \u2013 [[Earth Organisation]]. This revolves around the step-wise establishment of an International Environmental Organisation, building on the existing [[United Nations Environment Programme]] as its initial nucleus. Third, the WBGU highlights new avenues for financing global environmental policy \u2013 Earth Funding.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013  Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Biosphere (1999)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1999\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1999-biosphere/ Flagship report 1999], \u201eWorld in Transition: Conservation and Sustainable Use of the Biosphere.\u201c</ref>====\nBiodiversity - the planet's natural capital - is undergoing a dramatic collapse: its 'Sixth Extinction'. The losses, which are due to human activities and overexploitation of the biosphere, are irreversible. They are undermining the basis of future wellbeing and prosperity - including genetic resources and food production, climate stability, and coastal and soil protection. This volume presents an authoritative and alarming analysis of the state of the biosphere. The WBGU shows that the time remaining for remedial action is disappearing fast and sets out a range of initiatives to be undertaken at different levels. The main recommendations are:\n- protecting 10-20 per cent of the global land area\n- an 'Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity' to provide scientific advice\n- conservation of the diversity of cultivated as well as wild plant species\n- extending bioregional management and nature sponsorship\n- greater multilateral co-operation and implementation of the [[Convention on Biological Diversity]].\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Strategies for Managing Global Environmental Risks (1998)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1998\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1998-global-risks/ Flagship report 1998], \u201eWorld in Transition: Strategies for Managing Global Environmental Risks.\u201c</ref>====\nGlobal risk potentials and their interplay with economic, social and ecological processes of change have emerged as a challenge to the international community. Never before has human intervention in nature assumed global dimensions. This has been driven on the one hand by a growing global population, particularly in developing countries, and on the other hand by rising human demands in conjunction with specific patterns of production and consumption, above all in industrialised countries. By presenting this report, the WBGU hopes to contribute constructively to an effective, efficient and objective management of the risks of global change. The approach taken by the WBGU is first to classify globally relevant risks and then to assign to these classes of risk both established and innovative risk assessment strategies and risk management tools. On this basis, management priorities can be set. However, the WBGU notes that it is impossible to safeguard against all global risks, particularly as exploiting opportunities will always entail taking risks.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Ways Towards Sustainable Management of Freshwater Resources (1997)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1997\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1997-water/ Flagship report 1997], \u201eWorld in Transition: Ways Towards Sustainable Management of Freshwater Resources.\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe global water crisis is expected to become more severe in the near future. The WBGU presents an analysis of specific regions that are presently most affected by water shortages, and regions that will be particularly threatened by future water crises. In line with its past reports on global change, the WBGU examines three major \"syndromes of global change\" that are strongly linked to the worldwide water crisis. Based on this analysis, explicit recommendations for future research and for political action are presented.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 The Research Challenge  (1996)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1996\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1996-research/ Flagship report 1996], \u201eWorld in Transition: The Research Challenge.\u201c</ref>====\nDevelopment and environment problems have reached such alarming dimensions that the very survival of humanity is now subject to critical and unprecedented threats. So far, the scientific community has failed to deliver strategic responses adequate to this situation. Analyses produced by the separate disciplines are similarly inadequate due to the complexity of the problems involved and the intricate interlinkages between them. In this report, the WBGU criticizes Germany's global change research community for its lack of international orientation, its bias towards individual disciplines and for its weaknesses in translating scientific results into a form readily accessible to policymakers. The WBGU identifies alternatives for restructuring the research landscape, focusing primarily on a new \"Syndrome Approach\" for global change research. By applying this tool, scientists can systematically describe and analyze the \"diseases\" afflicting the Earth System, and thus elaborate response options. The 16 most important syndromes, or \"clinical profiles\" of Planet Earth were identified.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 Ways Towards Global Environmental Solutions (1995)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1995\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1995-global-policy/ Flagship report 1995], \u201eWorld in Transition: Ways Towards Global Environmental Solutions.\u201c</ref>====\nIn many areas of global change solutions are not at sight. However, dedicated and immediate action could, in principle, avert irreversible or disastrous damage to the global environment. Whether these steps will actually be taken will have to be seen, since substantial efforts and significant reorientations at the local, national and global level are necessary.\n\nTwo aspects have to be considered: on the one hand, at the societal level, the prerequisites for solving global environmental problems have to be improved. These measures present a challenge to nations and societies as a whole, where nongovernmental organisations could also play an important role. On the other hand, at the governmental level, international agreements must be formulated or intensified and enforced by suitable measures.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013 The Threat to Soils (1994)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1994\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1994-soils/ Flagship report 1994], \u201eWorld in Transition: The Threat to Soils.\u201c</ref>====\nSoils form an essential basis for humanity, but have received too little attention to date. In differing respects, human activities in many parts of the world lead to various levels of soil degradation, from declining fertility to irreversible destruction. Many local processes culminate to form a global environmental trend that must be counteracted by political action as a matter of urgency. The fact that the slow destruction of soils is a process barely perceptible to human senses has meant in turn that this topic is dealt with in the environmental debate as a somewhat marginal issue. Therefore, the threat to soils must be accorded much greater significance on the environmental agenda - improved legal frameworks must be created, both nationally and internationally, for soils as an environmental asset. The report is divided into two sections. The first section (standard section) presents and comments on new developments in various fields of Global Change. The second section of the report (focus section) deals with the global threat to soils. The WBGU emphasises that, in view of the seriousness of the soil problems outlined in this report, a new efficient institutional framework should now be established. For this reason the German Federal Government should decide in principle whether a differentiated \"Soil Declaration\" suffices or whether a global \"Soil Convention\" has to be striven for. This report provides the relevant arguments for both instruments. Global soil protection must obtain a similar attention on the international agenda as has been achieved for climate policy.\n\n====World in Transition \u2013  Basic Structure of Global People-Environment Interactions (1993)<ref name=\"Flagship report 1993\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/flagship-reports/fr-1993-people-environment/ Flagship report 1993], \u201eWorld in Transition: Basic Structure of Global People-Environment Interactions.\u201c</ref>====\nIn this report, the WBGU endeavours to provide a holistic analysis of the Earth System, whereby the central focus is directed at the principal interactions between nature and society. The aim here is to demonstrate the complexity of environmental problems, on the one hand, and to create, on the other, the analytical basis for assessing the impact of current trends on the system as a whole. The most serious global problems and major global trends in the estimation of the WBGU are:\n\n* Growth of the world's population\n* Long-term changes in the composition of the atmosphere\n* Loss of biodiversity\n* Degradation and loss of soils\n\nConcluding its report, the WBGU lays particular emphasis on three general recommendations:\n- German development aid should be increased to 1% of the GNP, whereby the term 'developing countries' should be redefined to include the states of Eastern Europe.\n- With respect to the instruments discussed in [[Rio de Janeiro]], the WBGU recommends that negotiations concerning a certificate scheme for reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions should be started, with the aim of achieving its international implementation. Parallel to the reduction of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions that would then occur, efforts should be made to increase the financial transfers for the protection of the tropical forests.\n- Programmes should be developed aiming at sensitising citizens to global environmental problems and promoting environmentally friendly behaviour.\n\n===Special Reports===\n\n====Development and justice through transformation: The Four Big \u2018I\u2019s  (2016)<ref name=\"Special Report 2016\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2016-g20/ Special report 2016], \u201eDevelopment and justice through transformation: The Four Big \u2018I\u2019s \u201c</ref>====\n2015 saw a historic double success for sustainability and climate policy. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the Paris Agreement on climate protection establish a system of ambitious policy goals for the world. The group of twenty major industrialized and emerging economies (G20) now needs to resolutely advance implementation of both agreements, seizing the opportunity of this \u2018Great Transformation\u2019 to sustainability as a unique modernization project that could offer substantial economic development opportunities. Complete decarbonization of the world economy, which is necessary to avoid the gravest climate risks, can only be achieved by profoundly transforming energy systems and other high-emissions infrastructures. This transformation could inspire Innovation and channel Investment into sustainability and climate protection, and into the kinds of sustainable Infrastructures that need to be established and expanded. At the same time, the transformation could combat inequality and promote Inclusion within societies and globally, thus becoming an equity project.\n\n====Climate Protection as a World Citizen Movement (2014)<ref name=\"Special Report 2014\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2014-climate-protection/ Special report 2014], \u201eClimate Protection as a World Citizen Movement\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe 5th Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) makes it unmistakably clear: unacceptable climatic consequences, which are likely to escalate beyond the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C guard rail, can only be avoided if further increases in greenhouse-gas concentrations are halted as soon as possible. The WBGU therefore recommends reducing CO2 emissions from fossil fuels to zero by 2070 at the latest. This policy goal is both ambitious and incisive, because 'the zero target must be reached' by every country, every municipality, every company and every citizen if the world as a whole is to become climate-neutral. However, the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C line can only be held if a large proportion of stakeholders \u2013 especially the OECD countries \u2013 start reducing their emissions much earlier. Global society as a whole has only a very limited carbon budget at its disposal; emissions should therefore peak by 2020 if possible, or in the third decade at the latest. In this report the WBGU outlines a two-pronged strategy for global climate protection based on interaction between multilateralism and civil society. To achieve this, on the one hand the Paris Climate Agreement targeted for late 2015 should exhibit certain characteristics set out by the WBGU. In particular, a process should be agreed to ensure compliance with the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C guard rail. On the other hand, all social actors should make their specific contributions towards decarbonization. In this way, an intricate responsibility architecture for the future of our planet can emerge in which vertical delegating and horizontal engagement are not contradictions, but complementary factors that reinforce each other.\n\n====Solving the climate dilemma: The budget approach (2009)<ref name=\"Special Report 2009\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2009-budget-approach/ Special report 2009], \u201eSolving the climate dilemma: The budget approach.\u201c</ref>====\n\nAt their meeting in the Italian city of L\u2019Aquila in July 2009, the heads of state and governments of the G8 countries and the [[Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate]] (MEF), whose members include India, Brazil and China, acknowledged the importance that [[global warming]] must not exceed the 2&nbsp;\u00b0C guard rail if dangerous climate change is to be avoided. WBGU views this as an extremely important step towards the adoption of a binding international agreement which establishes a well-founded target for global climate protection. The task now is to build on this consensus and reach agreement, at [[Copenhagen]], on a follow-up treaty to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which is due to expire in 2012. This new international agreement should translate the relevant scientific knowledge into a fair and practicable global strategy to combat global warming. So far, however, the lack of unanimity between the countries involved in the negotiating process has meant that there is no clear leitmotif pointing the way towards such an agreement.\n\n====The Future Oceans: Warming Up, Rising High, Turning Sour (2006)<ref name=\"Special report 2006\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2006-the-future-oceans/ Special report 2006], \u201eThe Future Oceans \u2013 Warming Up, Rising High, Turning Sour.\u201c</ref>====\nLatest research findings show that failure to check mankind's emissions of carbon dioxide will have severe consequences for the world's oceans. The marine environment is doubly affected: continuing warming and ongoing acidification both pose threats. In combination with over-fishing, these two threats are further jeopardizing already weakened fish stocks. Sea-level rise is exposing coastal regions to mounting flood and hurricane risks. To keep the adverse effects on human society and ecosystems within manageable limits, it will be essential to adopt new coastal protection approaches, designate marine protected areas and agree on ways to deal with refugees from endangered coastal areas. All such measures, however, can only succeed if global warming and ocean acidification are combated vigorously. Ambitious climate protection is therefore a key precondition to successful marine conservation and coastal protection.\n\n====Climate Protection Strategies for the 21st Century. Kyoto and Beyond (2003)<ref name=\"Special report 2003\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2003-kyoto-and-beyond/ Special report 2003], \u201eClimate Protection Strategies for the 21st Century. Kyoto and Beyond.\u201c</ref>====\nWith this special report, the WBGU provides recommendations for future negotiations within the context of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC), particularly relating to the Kyoto Protocol to the Convention. The report centres on three questions:\n*What is \u2018dangerous climate change\u2019 within the meaning of Article 2 of the UNFCCC?\n*Which socio-economically and technologically viable pathways are available to prevent such dangerous climate change?\n*How can all countries be integrated equitably within a system of emissions reduction commitments?\nThe report concentrates on the potentials to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide, this being the principal anthropogenic greenhouse gas. The analysis focuses, on the one hand, on the economic and technological potentials to reduce energy and industry related emissions and, on the other hand, on the relevance of biological sinks of carbon dioxide and the options to preserve them. Finally, based on this analysis, the report contains specific recommendations on ways to shape political and economic instruments in the second commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol.\n\n====Charging the Use of Global Commons (2002)<ref name=\"Special report 2002\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-2002-charging-the-use/ Special report 2002], \u201eCharging the Use of Global Commons.\u201c</ref>====\nGlobal common resources like international airspace and the high seas are in danger of overexploitation because the users need not bear the full social costs of their actions. The CO<sub>2</sub>-emissions of international aviation and of shipping are not subject to the quantitative reduction obligations of the Kyoto Protocol. Imposing user charges can close this regulatory gap and induce environment-related incentive effects to reduce environmental damage. Moreover, additional financial resources are generated, which should be earmarked for the protection and conservation of global common goods. In this special report, the WBGU makes recommendations for a politically viable implementation of the concept of global user charges for three specific areas of application:\n*   Charges on the use of airspace by aviation,\n*   Charges on the use of the oceans by shipping,\n*   Payments for non utilisation obligations.\n\n====Environment and Ethics (1999)<ref name=\"Special report 1999\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1999-environment-and-ethics/ Special report 1999], \u201eEnvironment and Ethics.\u201c</ref>====\nShould people be allowed to do everything they want? Should humankind be allowed to use nature and the environment completely for its own ends? More and more people are questioning the limits of human intervention in nature. What is ethically allowed and what should be prohibited? The WBGU offers some answers to these difficult questions. At the same time it has drawn up a number of principles, which should not be violated, even where there are big economical gains. In addition, in a democratic and culturally diverse society it is the task of ethics to lay down generally binding criteria for balancing between nature-related and, for example, economic matters. With these tools of ethical and economic criteria the [[Federal Government of Germany]] could support the interests of environmental protection at the international level.\n\n====The Accounting of Biological Sinks and Sources Under the Kyoto Protocol: A Step Forwards or Backwards for Global Environmental Protection? (1998)<ref name=\"Special report 1998\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1998-kyoto/ Special report 1998], \u201eThe Accounting of Biological Sinks and Sources Under the Kyoto Protocol: A Step Forwards or Backwards for Global Environmental Protection?.\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe WBGU assesses the Kyoto Protocol with respect to the accounting of biological sources and sinks. In principle, the WBGU supports the idea of linking climate protection and the conservation of sinks. However, the WBGU considers the form in which biological sources and sinks are accounted in the Kyoto Protocol to be inadequate and in need of improvement if the objectives of climate protection and biodiversity conservation are both to be served. The present accounting approach can lead to incentives with negative impacts upon climate protection, biodiversity conservation and soil protection. In addition, many uncertainties and imponderables attach to the reduction in net emissions that is achievable by means of terrestrial sinks. Even slight climate changes can lead to sinks becoming sources. Over the long run, fossil fuel emissions can not be compensated for by the terrestrial biosphere. The WBGU analyses the provisions of the Kyoto-Protocol and presents the state of knowledge on the source and sink potentials of terrestrial ecosystems and on the existing uncertainties and unresolved issues. This forms the basis for an assessment of the provisions of the Kyoto Protocol as well as for recommendations for the interpretation and concrete application of these provisions.\n\n====Targets for Climate Protection 1997<ref name=\"Special report 1997\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1997-climate-protection/ Special report 1997], \u201eTargets for Climate Protection.\u201c</ref>====\nThis statement was issued on the occasion of the Third Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the Climate Convention, FCCC), and contains recommendations on the commitments to be agreed upon in a protocol to the Convention. According to the \"Berlin Mandate\" adopted at the first Conference of the Parties, the commitments of the industrialized countries listed in Annex I of the Climate Convention are to be strengthened by setting quantified limitation and reduction objectives within specified time frames for their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. These measures are aimed at achieving the ultimate objective of the FCCC, namely a \"stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\".\n\n====Scenario for the derivation of global CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction targets and implementation strategies (1995)<ref name=\"Special report 1995\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/special-reports/sr-1995-co2-reduction/ Special report 1995], \u201eScenario for the derivation of global CO<sub>2</sub>-reduction targets and implementation strategies.\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe WBGU derives a global CO<sub>2</sub> reduction target by using an \"inverse scenario\" based on simplified models for climate dynamics and [[The Carbon Cycle|the carbon cycle]]. By first analysing the maximum stress levels caused by climate change that one can assume to be ecologically and economically bearable, a \"tolerance window\" for the future climatic development is deduced. In a further step, the set of admissible emission profiles is determined, i.e., those global CO<sub>2</sub> emission functions which keep the climate system within the demarcated window. Among the so-defined family of emission options a specific strategy is finally singled out by feasibility criteria. The WBGU believes that such an integrated assessment of the climate change problem in the \"backwards mode\" has several advantages in comparison with the straightforward approach. It has to be emphasised, however, that the analysis employs a number of assumptions and approximations and therefore has the character of a \"[[Gedankenexperiment]]\".\n\n===Policy Papers===\n\n====A European Way to our Common Digital Future<ref name=\"Policy Paper 11, 2019\">[https://www.wbgu.de/en/publications/publication/pp11-2019 Policy Paper 11, 2019], \u201eA European Way to our Common Digital Future\u201c</ref>====\nParticularly during its presidency of the Council of the EU in 2020, Germany should build upon the Green Deal announced by EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and work towards a close integration of digital change and sustainability. The new EU Parliament and the new European Commission should also pursue this goal. To this end the WBGU presents 7 cornerstones of a European way to a common digital future:\n\n# Integrate the opportunities and risks of digitalization into EU sustainability policy: The EU needs an implementation strategy for the SDGs that also places digital technologies at the service of sustainability and addresses its risks. In the same way, digitalization should be embedded in the 8th Environmental Action Programme from 2021 onwards. \n# Actively shape digital policy in line with sustainability goals: Ecological and social aimsthat can be reached through digitalization shouldbe pursued with equal emphasis, e.g. via the European Digital Agenda, the European Commission\u2019s Strategy for Artificial Intelligence (AI), or measures within the framework of the Digital Europe programme. Negative (side) effects should be identified and minimized at an early stage.\n# Involve the private sector more in the provision of data: Up to now, EU data policy has concentrated on the protection of personal data and the use of data from public authorities. This does not go far enough: accessibility to, and the re-use of (non-personal) private-sector data should also be improved in order to create data that can be used for the common good and digitalized (knowledge) assets. \n# Develop and apply artificial intelligence in a sustainable way: The EU should be consistent in following its value-based approach in the application and development of AI systems: fundamental rights, human dignity, environmental and sustainability principles are the normative foundation of the EU and non-negotiable. There is an urgent need for (framework) legislation on the development and handling of AI, since ethical guidelines and debates alone are not enough to ensure a corresponding development and application. In addition, research on explainable and secure, i.e. reliably verified and validated, AI should be promoted and used to ensure trustworthy, fair and accountable procedures.\n# Ensure access to digital commons and basic services through public-service information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructures: Individual inclusion, personal development, environmental protection, fair competition and a functioning digital public sphere require access to data and services such as cloud services, mobility platforms or a search index. Their almost exclusively private-sector provision is not always in the interests of the common good. The EU\u2019s task should be to create or ensure public-service digital and digitalized infrastructures to make data and information accessible for the common good and to offer alternative (basic) services under public law.\n# Gear EU research policy and promotion of innovations consistently towards sustainability goals: Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) should be applied as an overarching concept of European research and innovation policy in order to explicitly embed the orientation towards sustainability goals and to avoid unintended impacts. The high levels of protection of the environment, consumers and occupational health and safety in the EU must not be weakened by the innovation principle currently under discussion. Horizon Europe\u2019s missions should aim to integrate digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability and strengthen transformative and transformation research. \n# European digitalization model as a priority in foreign policy: The EU should also promote the integration of sustainability and digitalization internationally. It should initiate a summit on \u2018Sustainability in the Digital Age\u2019, e.g. for 2022, symbolically 30 years after the Earth Summit in Rio, to set the course for the necessary continuation of the sustainability agenda until 2030 and beyond.\n\n\n====Digital Momentum for the UN Sustainability Agenda in the 21st Century<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2019\">[https://www.wbgu.de/en/publications/publication/pp10-2019 Policy Paper 2019], \u201eDigital Momentum for the UN Sustainability Agenda in the 21st Century\u201c</ref>====\n\nGlobal digital change should be designed to support the implementation of the 2030 Agenda with its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Up to now, hopes that digitalization would make a contribution to achieving these goals has not materialized. Only if digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability are constructively interlinked can we make progress with environmental protection, climate-change mitigation and human development. The WBGU would like to introduce into the discussion four ideas directly related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). First: promote a global (environmental) awareness among people worldwide by providing a stronger future-proof education. The focus should be on enabling people to actively shape digital change and the Transformation towards Sustainability. Open data relating to sustainability and virtual learning environments are important elements for experiencing ecosystems. In concrete terms, an integrated programme for future-proof education should be developed, UN processes should be opened up to citizen-science projects, and an International Information Union should be founded to collect, process and publish sustainability-related data. Second, establish a digitally enhanced circular economy. The transition from linear and resource-intensive value chains to a near-complete circular economy is a key component of the Transformation towards Sustainability. Digital data acquisition and processing offer great potential for this. Environmentally harmful emissions and resource depletion should be recorded across all sectors of the economy and value chains, and greater efforts should be made to implement the 3Rs strategy (reduce, reuse, recycle) at the international level. Third, modernize sustainability policy itself by using digital solutions. Digitally enhanced governance can help improve the transparency of political actions, as well as the participation and worldwide networking of political actors. Coordination within the UN system should be intensified by establishing a 'UN Digitalization Initiative'; a 'UN Framework Convention on Digital Sustainability and Sustainable Digitalization' should be negotiated; and a globally uniform set of indicators for the SDGs should be developed to facilitate the comparability and verifiability of national reports. Fourth, further develop the global sustainability agenda beyond 2030 against the background of the opportunities and risks of the Digital Age. The UN should prepare for these future challenges in good time. The WBGU recommends convening a UN summit on 'Sustainability in the Digital Age' in 2022 \u2013 30 years after the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro \u2013 to set the course for continuing the sustainability agenda beyond 2030. A key outcome could be the adoption of a charter entitled 'Towards Our Common Digital Future'.\n\n====Just & In\u2013Time Climate Policy: Four Initiatives for Fairness (2018){{nnbsp}}<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2018\">{{cite book\n | author = WBGU\n | title = Just & in-time climate policy: four initiatives for a fair transformation \u2014 Policy paper 9\n | date = 20 July 2018\n | publisher = Scientific Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU)\n | location = Berlin, Germany\n | isbn = 978-3-936191-86-8\n | url = https://www.wbgu.de/fileadmin/user_upload/wbgu.de/templates/dateien/veroeffentlichungen/politikpapiere/pp2018-pp9/wbgu_policypaper_9.pdf\n | access-date = 2018-12-02\n}}  Translation from German.\n</ref>====\nLimiting global warming to well below 2&nbsp;\u00b0C requires the rapid decarbonization of the global economy. If this enterprise fails, we will jeopardize the life-support systems of future generations. The longer the transformation towards climate compatibility is delayed, the more severe the risks and damage will be for a growing number of people. The transformation requirements and the damage caused by climate change have an unequal temporal, geographical and social distribution \u2013 as do the respective possibilities for dealing with them. The WBGU therefore proposes a just & in-time transformation that takes into account all people affected, empowers them, holds those responsible for climate change accountable, and creates both global and national prospects for the future. The WBGU proposes that the German Federal Government should promote four exemplary initiatives of a just & in-time climate policy targeting (1) the people affected by the structural change towards climate compatibility (e.g. in coal-mining regions), (2) the legal rights of people harmed by climate change, (3) the dignified migration of people who lose their native countries due to climate change, and (4) the creation of financing instruments for just & in-time transformation processes.\n\n====Human progress within planetary guard rails. A contribution to the SDG debate (2014)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2014\">[https://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-8-2014-sdg/ Policy Paper 2014], \u201eHuman progress within planetary guard rails. A contribution to the SDG debate\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe year 2015 has special importance for the transformation towards sustainable development. New Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are then supposed to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The aim is to offer a new orientation for political action in the coming decades. The WBGU recommends orienting the new catalogue of goals towards the key message of the 1992 Earth Summit: that development and environmental protection must be considered together and do not contradict each other. The SDGs should not be reduced to poverty eradication, but must address all dimensions of sustainable development. In particular, global environmental change must be incorporated, otherwise even poverty eradication will become impossible. Up to now, too little attention has been paid to this link in the ongoing discourse on SDGs. Although many reports mention the concept of planetary guard rails or planetary boundaries, they do not back this up with specific targets. The WBGU presents recommendations on how guard rails for global environmental problems should be incorporated in the SDG catalogue and operationalized by means of corresponding targets.\n\n====Financing the Global Energy-System Transformation (2012)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2012\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policypaper-7/ Policy Paper 2012], \u201eFinancing the Global Energy System Transformation\u201c</ref>====\n\nThe world faces the challenge of a global transformation to sustainable energy systems. Substantial up-front investments are needed to improve energy efficiency and switch to renewable energies. At the same time, these investments offer great opportunities, because strategic innovations can be triggered and new markets can develop in the course of the transformation process. Savings on the cost of fossil fuels in conventional technologies could completely offset the investment in renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency by as early as 2040. The private capital needed for the transformation is available and can be mobilised if a suitable political framework is put into place. A corresponding regulatory policy should be introduced to make such investment more attractive for the private sector. The WBGU advocates a proactive state that integrates energy, environmental and climate policy; this could reduce existing investment risks by developing a stable, long-term transformative regulatory framework. At the same time, policy makers should expand the opportunities for participation. Germany is currently leading this transformation, both in terms of technological innovations and in the creation of a suitable policy framework. Our country is able to give the world an example of how the [[Energiewende]] (energy-system transformation) can generate more, not less prosperity.\n\n====Climate Policy Post-Copenhagen: A Three-Level Strategy for Success (2010)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2010\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policypaper-6/ Policy Paper 2010], \u201eClimate policy post-Copenhagen: Action at three levels offers prospect of success.\u201c</ref>====\n\nInternational climate policy post-Copenhagen is in crisis. There is currently no prospect of the comprehensive and binding UN climate treaty \u2013 the outcome hoped for at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference \u2013 being achieved within the foreseeable future. However, in order to keep the global mean temperature rise below 2&nbsp;\u00b0C by the end of the century, a resolute course must be set in the international climate process within the next few years. The WBGU recommends that in order to revitalise the multilateral climate process, policy-makers and civil society in Europe take on a self-confident leading role in global alliances with selected \u2018climate pioneer\u2019 countries and that more intensive support be provided for civil society initiatives. The aim of establishing a binding international regime to limit CO<sub>2</sub> emissions \u2013 based, for example, on the WBGU's own budget approach and similar approaches now also being discussed in China and India \u2013 must remain in place. The following recommendations are directed primarily towards the German Government in light of its role in the international arena, particularly within [[the European Union]] (EU), at intergovernmental level via its bilateral and multilateral cooperation, and in the United Nations context.\n\n====New impetus for climate policy: Making the most of Germany's dual presidency (2007)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2007\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-5/ Policy Paper 2007], \u201eNew impetus for climate policy: Making the most of Germany's dual presidency.\u201c</ref>====\n\nIf dangerous climate change is still to be avoided, a reversal of current trends must be achieved within the next ten years, and greenhouse gas emissions worldwide must be halved by 2050 compared with a 1990 baseline. However, there is a widening gap between the action that is urgently needed and current climate policy. The WBGU is therefore convinced that a new climate policy dynamic is required worldwide and that Germany's double presidency of the European Union and P of G8 offers a dual opportunity to drive climate protection forward. The WBGU's core messages are:\n*Climate protection is both worthwhile and feasible: Investing in climate protection is economically efficient, as the costs of effective climate protection are far lower than the costs of inaction.\n*Further development of the UN climate convention: A consensus on the mitigation target must be forged and enshrined in the convention. To this end, the WBGU recommends the adoption of a global temperature guard rail limiting the rise in near-surface air temperature to a maximum of 2&nbsp;\u00b0C relative to the pre-industrial value \u2013 equivalent to stabilizing the concentration of greenhouse gases below 450 ppm CO2eq.\n*Making the most of the G8 Summit at Heiligendamm: Fresh initiatives from the heads of state and government are required to inject new life into the faltering climate process.\n*Reaffirming the European Union's leading role: The European Union should expand its leading role in international climate protection.\n\n====Development needs Environmental Protection: Recommendations for the Millennium + 5 Summit (2005)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2005\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-4/ Policy Paper 2005], \u201eDevelopment needs Environmental Protection: Recommendations for the Millennium + 5 Summit.\u201c</ref>====\nThe Millennium + 5 Summit will review progress towards the achievement of the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) and take stock of the United Nations' capacity to act. The Summit offers the opportunity to set a new course in international poverty reduction and initiate a reform of the UN. If the MDGs fail, international cooperation will be plunged into crisis. Yet the current poverty debate tends to overlook the environmental problems which exacerbate poverty in many developing countries. The international community should therefore remind itself of the message sent out by the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992: environmental and development policies are inextricably linked. WBGU's core recommendations are:\n*Linking poverty reduction with environmental policy: The MDGs cannot be achieved without environmental protection measures. Environmental policy is therefore a prerequisite for development and must be a key element in any long-term poverty reduction strategy. Conversely, the global environment cannot be protected without development policy.\n*Forging strategic partnerships with anchor countries: Due to their size and dynamic economies, developing countries such as China, Brazil and India play a key role both in global environmental changes and in poverty reduction. The strategic foci of development cooperation with these countries must be placed accordingly.\n*Reforming the development and environment policy architecture: The division of labour in international development policy should be improved and the fragmentation of the multilateral development and environment institutions overcome. In the medium term, a new Council on Global Development and Environment should replace the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).\n*Increasing the funding commitments: The international community should invest more intensively in poverty reduction and environmental protection: the costs of inaction would be significantly higher. As well as increasing funds committed to development cooperation, new financing instruments, such as charges for the use of global common goods, should be introduced.\n\n====Renewable energies for sustainable development: Impulses for renewables 2004<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2004\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-3/ Policy Paper 2004], \u201eRenewable energies for sustainable development: Impulses for renewables.\u201c</ref>====\n\nEnergy is a key theme for future world development. Worldwide energy demand is mounting rapidly, particularly in the developing and newly industrialising countries, which seek to catch up with the level of economic development attained by industrialised countries. The great challenge now is to meet this energy demand in a sustainable manner. However, sustainable development will be inconceivable without a deep-seated reconfiguration of worldwide energy systems. One goal in this context must be to protect natural life-support systems and, in particular, to prevent dangerous anthropogenic perturbation of the climate system. If the present path continues and rising energy demand is met mainly from fossil sources, this would trigger intolerable global climate change with high consequential costs, and would thus also jeopardize economic development. A second necessary goal is to eradicate energy poverty in developing countries in order that these countries can make use of development opportunities. It is essential that 2.4&nbsp;billion people gain access to modern forms of energy so that they can shake off the yoke of energy poverty. To attain these two goals, energy systems need to be turned towards sustainability. To that end, efficiency must be improved at all levels of the energy system, and fossil energy sources must be substituted by renewable ones. The potential of renewable energies, above all solar energy, is almost unlimited and can be harnessed sustainably. Energy system transformation towards sustainability is thus the first step into the solar age. However, without rapid and resolute international policy support, the expansion of renewable energy sources will not be able to develop the necessary dynamics in time. The International Conference for Renewable Energies (renewables 2004) held in Bonn 2004 is a milestone for this process.\n\n====Charging the Use of Global Commons (2002)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2002\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-2/ Policy Paper 2002], \u201eCharging the Use of Global Commons.\u201c</ref>====\nIn this policy paper, the WBGU summarizes the key findings of its special report on user charges within the framework of global sustainability policy, and makes recommendations for a politically viable implementation of the concept of global user charges for three specific areas of application:\n*  Charges on the use of airspace by aviation,\n*  Charges on the use of the oceans by shipping,\n*  Payments for non utilization obligations.\n\n====The Johannesburg Opportunity: Key Elements of a Negotiation Strategy (2001)<ref name=\"Policy Paper 2001\">[http://www.wbgu.de/en/policypaper/policy-paper-1/ Policy Paper 2001], \u201eThe Johannesburg Opportunity: Key Elements of a Negotiation Strategy.\u201c</ref>====\nJohannesburg in South Africa is a symbolically important venue for the [[World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (WSSD). No other continent has been affected worse by the impacts of global change and exhibits in such representative form the critical environmental and socioeconomic situation facing many developing countries. At the same time, the host nation epitomizes new hopes and beginnings following the radical changes it has undergone in recent years. A new beginning is necessary at the international level, too, given the further deterioration in the state of the global environment since the 1992 [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro. New problems have arisen and the most critical remain unsolved. The WSSD to be held in September 2002 in Johannesburg provides the international community with yet another opportunity to set the future direction of international environment and development policy. In the run-up to this event, the WBGU would like to focus the attention of the Federal Government of Germany on some crucial issues where decisions in Johannesburg could help to eliminate critical shortcomings in current environment and development policy. A great deal has been achieved in the field of global environmental policymaking since 1992, in particular the international conventions and treaties dealing with a range of global environmental problems such as climate change, loss of biodiversity, desertification, or the impacts of persistent organic pollutants. In the view of the WBGU, the Johannesburg summit should therefore refrain from detailed negotiations on these topics. However, it must be possible to provide new ideas and inspiration, to close gaps and loopholes, and to take the various conventions a stage further\n\n== Quotes about WBGU reports ==\n\n\"The reports of the German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) are an indispensable reference and resource on global environmental change policies.

It is bold, meticulously crafted through argument (as opposed to assertion) and evidence, and rooted in a highly original conceptual framework that is both global in scope and differentiated. The report asserts the centrality of cultural and institutional change and does not shy away from being specific and programmatic at a moment when it seems that political discourses are increasingly disconnected from our highly fractious, unsustainable, violent and intolerant times. I recommend it as compulsory reading in the strongest possible terms.\"\n\nProfessor [[Edgar Pieterse]], Director \u2013 African Centre for Cities (University of Cape Town) & Chairperson of the Cities Alliance Think Tank.\n\n\u201eThe new WBGU-Study \u201eA Social Contract for Sustainability\u201d appears at a time in which people around the world are increasingly committed to creating a future that is both sustainable and climate-safe. The study shows that such a future will only be possible if governments, business and  civil society collectively set the right course, making the most of regional, national and global cooperation. An important call to cross-cutting integrated action, the book deserves wide recognition.\u201c\n\n[[Christiana Figueres]], Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (2010-2016)\n\n\"The geopolitical world is changing beyond recognition. The challenge of ensuring that in the future people can live better than today, while doing so within the Planetary Boundaries has yet to be met.  Markets and the environment are increasingly globalized.  Social protection and the search for equity are not, though there are interesting signs of change.  There are many international institutions, but few are global.  We have known for some time the necessary individual solutions required for the transition.  Now, the WBGU report `World in Transition \u2013 A Social Contract for Sustainability\u00b4 offers us extremely interesting ideas on how we can bring all this together collectively through a new social contract that is global, equitable and green, and requires a new kind of global citizenship: the first steps toward a global political project for global sustainability.\"\n\n[[Janos Pasztor]], Executive Secretary UN Secretary-General's High-level Panel on Global Sustainability 2010-12\n\n\u201cThe `World in Transition \u2013 Governing the Marine Heritage\u00b4 report presents a thought provoking look at crucial aspects of oceans governance. It resonates strongly with our thinking in the World Bank and among the partners of the Global Partnership for Oceans. Nation states, civil society and industry need to work together to support more sustainable and productive ocean use. This report makes a valuable contribution to global thinking on how best we might secure a sustainable future from healthy oceans.\u201d\n\n[[Rachel Kyte]], Vice President, Sustainable Development, The World Bank (2014-2015)\n\n\"Biofuels have been represented by some as a silver bullet to the climate change threat, and by others as a fatal mistake set to destroy forests and increase hunger; they are neither. Sane and sensibly developed they offer a chance to reduce emissions, generate employment and diversify rural livelihoods. But widespread commercialisation without proper sustainability standards could prove a disaster, causing more environmental and human harm than good. The new WBGU report shows that a sustainable use of bioenergy is possible and outlines how opportunities can be exploited while at the same time minimizing risks. The report thus offers policy-makers valuable guidance for a sustainable bioenergy policy.\"\n\n[[Achim Steiner]], Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2006-2016)\n\n\"With Climate Change as a Security Risk, WBGU has compiled a flagship report on an issue that quite rightly is rising rapidly up the international political agenda.

The report makes it clear that climate policy is preventative security policy.\"\n\n[[Achim Steiner]], Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) (2006-2016)\n\n\u201eWith its interdisciplinary approach, providing a complex and systematic analysis of the poverty-environment nexus, WBGU's latest report breaks new ground. Indira Gandhi's old, convenient maxim was 'Poverty is the biggest polluter'. Put forward at the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment in Stockholm, it has been sorely misused ever since to override environmental precaution and prioritize economic development strategies instead. The new WBGU report maps out a way to shape a coherent environment and development policy.

The World Summit on Sustainable Development gave great attention to this challenge, but failed to agree on a quantitative, time-bound target for the introduction of renewable energy sources. The German Advisory Council on Global Change (WBGU) has now produced a report with a global focus; this is essential in view of the global impacts of climatic changes. The report provides a convincing long-term analysis; this, too, is essential, for global energy policies must take a long-term perspective, over a time frame of 50 to 100 years, while providing concrete guidance for decision makers to be implemented now. There is an urgent need to identify paths by which to secure energy supply for the 2.4 billion people who still depend upon traditional biomass, while keeping clearly in view the need to combine this challenge with the prevention of perilous climatic changes.

Quezon City is not located in, and should not be confused with, [[Quezon (province)|Quezon Province]], which was also named after the president.\n\nQuezon City hosts a number of government offices, the most important of which are the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]] (the seat of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], the [[lower chamber]] of the [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]]), and the [[Quezon City Reception House]] (the current seat of the [[Vice President of the Philippines]]).<ref name=\"qcpubliclibrary.org\" /> Quezon City also serves as home to the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]]\u2014the national university\u2014and [[Ateneo de Manila University]].\n\nAlso located in Quezon City is the [[Quezon Memorial Circle]], a [[national park]]. The park is an ellipse bounded by [[Elliptical Road]]. Its main feature is the [[Quezon Memorial Shrine]], a 66-meter-tall [[mausoleum]] containing the remains of President Quezon and his wife, [[First Spouse of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Aurora Quezon]]. The shrine is considered Quezon City's foremost landmark and is depicted in its city seal.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Manuel L. Quezon (November 1942).jpg|thumb|180px|left|Commonwealth President [[Manuel L. Quezon]].]]\n\nBefore Quezon City was created, its land was settled by the small individual towns of [[Quezon City#San Francisco del Monte|San Francisco del Monte]], [[Quezon City#Novaliches|Novaliches]], and Balintawak. On August 23, 1896, the [[Katipunan]], led by its ''Supremo'' [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]], [[Cry of Pugad Lawin|launched]] the [[Philippine Revolution]] against the [[Spanish Empire]] at the house of [[Melchora Aquino]] in Pugad Lawin (now known as Balintawak).\n\nIn the early 20th century, President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] dreamt of a city that would become the future capital of the country to replace Manila. It is believed that his earlier trip in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] influenced his vision.<ref name=\"QC001\">{{cite web|url=http://www.quezoncity.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&id=319&Itemid=277|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426201638/http://www.quezoncity.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&id=319&Itemid=277|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 26, 2014|title=Milestones in History|author=Web Admin|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"QC002\">{{cite web|url=http://info.philtravelcenter.com/qc-history.php|title=Quezon City Brief History, Philippines (Official Website of PhilTravelcenter.com \u2013 Quezon City Metro Manila, Philippines)|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938, President Quezon created the People's Homesite Corporation and purchased {{convert|15.29|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} from the vast [[Quezon City#Diliman|Diliman]] Estate of the Tuason family; this piece of land became known then as ''Barrio Obrero'' (\"Workers' Village\"). The [[National Assembly of the Philippines]] passed Commonwealth Act 502, known as the Charter of Quezon City, originally proposed as \"Balintawak City; Assemblymen [[Narciso Ramos]] and Ramon Mitra Sr. successfully lobbied the assembly to name the city after the incumbent president. President Quezon allowed the bill to lapse into law without his signature on October 12, 1939, thus establishing Quezon City.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" />\n\nWhen Quezon City was created in 1939, the following barrios or sitios: Balingasa, Balintawak, Galas, Kaingin, Kangkong, La Loma, Malamig, Masambong, Matalahib, San Isidro, San Jose, Santol, and Tatalon from [[Caloocan]]; Cubao, the western half of Diliman, Kamuning, New Manila, Roxas, and San Francisco del Monte from [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]]; Balara, Barangka, the eastern half of Diliman, Jesus de la Pe\u00f1a and Krus na Ligas from [[Marikina]]; Libis, Santolan and Ugong Norte from [[Pasig]] and some barrios from [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]] and [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] were to be given to the new capital city. Instead of opposing them, the six towns willingly gave land to Quezon City in the belief that it would benefit the country's new capital. However, in 1941, the area within [[Wack Wack Golf and Country Club]] was reverted to [[Mandaluyong]], and Barangka and Jesus de la Pe\u00f1a to Marikina. In addition, the land of [[Camp Crame]] was originally part of San Juan.  On January 1, 1942, President Quezon issued an executive order from the tunnel of Corregidor designating Jorge Vargas Mayor of Greater Manila, a new political entity comprising, aside from Manila proper, Quezon City, Kalookan, Pasay, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Makati, and Para\u00f1aque.  Greater Manila would later be expanded to include Las Pi\u00f1as, Malabon, and Navotas.\n\n[[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] forces occupied Quezon City in 1942 during [[World War II]]. In October of that year, the Japanese authorities divided the City of Greater Manila into twelve districts, two of which were formed from Quezon City:  Balintawak which consisted of San Francisco del Monte, Galas, and La Loma; and Diliman which consisted of Diliman proper, Cubao, and the University District. In 1945, combined Filipino and American troops under the [[United States Army]], [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]], and [[Philippine Constabulary]], with help from recognized guerrilla units, liberated and recaptured Quezon City in a few months, expelling Imperial Japanese forces.  Heavy fighting occurred near Novaliches, which at that time was in Rizal Province and New Manila which was a [[strongpoint]].  Toward the end of the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]], Pres. [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]] dissolved the Greater Manila Complex, which included the Japanese-created districts of Balintawak and Diliman which had been formed from the prewar Quezon City.\n\nAfter the war, Republic Act No. 333, which redefined the Caloocan\u2013Quezon City boundary, was signed by President [[Elpidio Quirino]] on July 17, 1948, declaring Quezon City to be the national capital, and specifying the city's area to be {{convert|156.60|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}. The barrios of Baesa, Bagbag, Banlat, Kabuyao, Novaliches Proper, Pasong Putik, Pasong Tamo, Pugad Lawin, San Bartolome, and Talipapa, which belonged to Novaliches and had a combined area of about 8,100 hectares, were taken from Caloocan and ceded to Quezon City. This caused the territorial division of [[Caloocan]] into two non-contiguous parts, the South section being the more urbanized part, and the North half being sub-rural. On June 16, 1950, the Quezon City Charter was revised by Republic Act No. 537, changing the city's boundaries to an area of {{convert|153.59|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" /> Exactly six years after on June 16, 1956, more revisions to the city's land area were made by Republic Act No. 1575, which defined its area as {{convert|151.06|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}. According to the [[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] and [[Geoscience Australia]] on their study earthquake impact and risk assessment on the Greater Metropolitan Manila Area, the total area of Quezon City stood at {{convert|165.33|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"arearef1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mbc.com.ph/engine/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Solidum-Update-of-Earthquake-Hazards-and-Risk-Assessment-of-MMla-14Nov2013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624134051/http://www.mbc.com.ph/engine/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Solidum-Update-of-Earthquake-Hazards-and-Risk-Assessment-of-MMla-14Nov2013.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 24, 2016 |title=An Update on the Earthquake Hazards and Risk Assessment of Greater Metropolitan Manila Area |publisher=[[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] |date=November 14, 2013 |accessdate=May 16, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"arearef2\">{{cite web |url=http://ndrrmc.gov.ph/attachments/article/1509/Component_5_Earthquake_Risk_Analysis_Technical%20Report_-_Final_Draft_by_GA_and_PHIVOLCS.pdf |title=Enhancing Risk Analysis Capacities for Flood, Tropical Cyclone Severe Wind and Earthquake for the Greater Metro Manila Area Component 5 \u2013 Earthquake Risk Analysis |publisher=[[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] and [[Geoscience Australia]] |accessdate=May 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn October 1, 1975, Quezon City was the actual site of the \"[[Thrilla in Manila]]\" boxing fight between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Joe Frazier]], which took place at the [[Araneta Coliseum]]. It was renamed as the \"Philippine Coliseum\" for the event.\n\nOn November 7, 1975, the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 824 of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] established Metro Manila.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" /> Quezon City became one of Metro Manila's 17 cities and municipalities. The next year, Presidential Decree No. 940 transferred the capital back to [[Manila]] on June 24, 1976. On March 31, 1978, President Marcos ordered the transfer of the remains of President Quezon from [[Manila North Cemetery]] to the completed [[Quezon Memorial Circle|Quezon Memorial Monument]] within Elliptical Road. On February 22, 1986, the Quezon City portion of the [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (between [[Camp Crame]] and [[Camp Aguinaldo]]) became the venue of the bloodless [[People Power Revolution]] that overthrew Marcos.\n\nOn February 23, 1998, Republic Act. No. 8535 was signed by President [[Fidel Ramos]].<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" /> The Act provided for the creation of the City of Novaliches comprising the 15 northernmost barangays of Quezon City. However, in the succeeding plebiscite on October 23, 1999, an overwhelming majority of Quezon City residents rejected the secession of Novaliches.\n\nQuezon City is the first local government in the [[Philippines]] with a computerized real estate assessment and payment system. The city government developed a database system in 2015 that contains around 400,000 property units with capability to record payments.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" />\n\nThe city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15, 2020 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n=== Master Plans ===\nIn 1938, President Quezon made a decision to push for a new capital city. [[Manila]] was getting crowded, and his [[military advisor]]s (reportedly) told him that Manila, being by the bay, was an easy target for bombing by [[Naval artillery|naval guns]] in case of attack\u2013a real possibility in the late 1930s. Military advisers, however, did not anticipate aerial bombardment.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" />\n\nQuezon supported the idea of a new city at least {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} away from [[Manila Bay]] (beyond the reach of naval guns). He contacted [[William E. Parsons]], American architect and planner, who had been the consulting architect for the islands early in the American colonial period. Parsons came over in the summer of 1939 and helped select the Diliman (Tuason) estate as the site for the new city. Unfortunately, he died later that year, leaving his partner Harry Frost to take over. Frost collaborated with [[Juan Arellano]], engineer A.D. Williams, and landscape architect and planner Louis Croft to craft a grand master plan for the new capital.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" />\n\nThe plan was approved by the Philippine authorities in 1941. The core of the new city was to be a 400&nbsp;ha central green, about the size of [[New York City|New York's]] [[Central Park]], and defined by North, South (Timog), East and West Avenues. On one corner of the proposed Diliman Quadrangle was delineated a 25-hectare elliptical site. This was to contain a large capitol building to house the [[Philippine Legislature]] and ancillary structures for the offices of representatives.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" />\n\nOn either side of the giant ellipse were supposed to have been the new [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]] on North Avenue (site of the present-day [[Veterans Memorial Medical Center|Veterans Memorial Hospital]]), and the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] Complex along East Avenue (now the site of East Avenue Medical Center). The three branches of government were to be finally and efficiently located in close proximity to each other.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" />\n{{go to top}}\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Qc-welcome-rotonda-2010.JPG|250px|thumb|Aerial view of Quezon City with Welcome Rotonda in the foreground]]\nThe city lies on the Guadalupe Plateau, a relatively high plateau at the northeast of the metropolis situated between the lowlands of [[Manila]] to the southwest and the [[Marikina River]] Valley to the east. The southern portion is drained by the narrow [[San Juan River (Quezon City)|San Juan River]] and its tributaries to [[Pasig River]], while running in the northern portions of the city is the equally-narrow [[Tullahan River]].\n\nQuezon City is bordered by [[Manila]] to the southwest, by [[Caloocan]] and [[Valenzuela City]] to the west and northwest. To the south lie [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] and [[Mandaluyong]], while [[Marikina]] and [[Pasig]] border the city to the southeast. To the north across Marilao River lies [[San Jose del Monte]] in the province of [[Bulacan]], while to the east lie [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]] and [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]], both in the province of [[Rizal]].\n\nThe city can be divided into a number of areas.

It is headquartered at Barangay Quirino 2-C.\n\n== Districts ==\n[[File:Ph fil quezon city barangay.png|thumb|220px|Political map of Quezon City]]\nQuezon City is divided into six legislative districts, in turn subdivided in a total of [[Barangays of Quezon City|142 barangays]]. Each district is represented by six City Councilors, six representatives/congressmen, one from each district are elected as members of the National Legislature. The number of barangays per district is: District I, 37; District II, 5; District III, 37; District IV, 38; District V, 14; and District VI, 11; Although District II has the fewest barangays, it is the biggest in land area, including the Novaliches Reservoir.\n\nThe [[La Mesa Watershed Reservation]] in Novaliches is the last forest of its size in the metropolis; the La Mesa Dam is an [[earth dam]] whose reservoir can hold up to 50.5&nbsp;million cubic meters and occupying an area of {{convert|27|km\u00b2|0|abbr=out}}, it is also part of the [[Angat Dam|Angat]]\u2013[[Ipo Dam|Ipo]]\u2013La Mesa water system which supplies most of the water supply of [[Metro Manila]].\n\n=== Bagumbayan ===\nLocated at the southeastern corner of Quezon City, Bagumbayan is one of the newly developed commercial areas in Quezon City. The [[Eastwood City]] Business Center is situated here. It consists of several office and residential skyscrapers, including many local IT and consumer electronic firms. Numerous bars and restaurants have been put up since 2000 along [[Circumferential Road 5|E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue (C-5)]]. Many of which are open-air restaurants and coffee shops reminiscent of Paris boulevards, but with a modern architecture. With this, Bagumbayan is fast becoming one of the hippest areas for night entertainment, similar to the [[Malate, Manila|Malate]] and [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]] districts of Manila.\n\nWest of Bagumbayan are many high-end gated communities like the Acropolis, Blue Ridge, Greenmeadows, White Plains, Corinthian Hills, and Corinthian Gardens. Further west are [[Camp Aguinaldo]] and [[Camp Crame]]. Camp Aguinaldo is the general headquarters of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] while Camp Crame is the headquarters of the [[Philippine National Police]]. Bagumbayan also covers a sliver of [[Ortigas Center]] business district at the southeast corner of EDSA and Ortigas Avenue, where [[Robinsons Galleria]], the [[EDSA Shrine]], and Cyberpod Corinthian are located. It also houses the [[Circulo Verde]] mixed-use development.\n\n=== Commonwealth Avenue ===\n[[File:Batasan front qc.jpg|thumb|The [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]], home to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]]]]\nNorth of Diliman lies the Commonwealth area, so named because of [[Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City|Commonwealth Avenue (R-7)]] (formerly called Don Mariano Marcos Avenue) which runs through its center. Barangays in this area include [[Batasan Hills, Quezon City|Batasan Hills]], Barangay Commonwealth, Holy Spirit and Old Balara. This is primarily a residential area home to many subdivisions ([[Homeowner association|residential associations]]), among these are Ferndale Villas, Don Antonio Royale, Don Antonio Heights, BF Homes QC, Ferndale Homes, Vista Real, Filinvest 1 and 2, New Capitol Estates and others. The government center in Quezon City was originally planned to be at what is now the location of the [[Quezon Memorial Circle]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qcpubliclibrary.org/qcmanuscript.php|title=Quezon City Public Library \u2013 Quezonian Newsletter|accessdate=September 14, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924083509/http://www.qcpubliclibrary.org/qcmanuscript.php|archivedate=September 24, 2015}}</ref> but it was then moved further north to where Batasan hills is now. Resultantly, there are important government establishments nearby such as the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit of the Philippines]], the [[Sandiganbayan]], a special court with a rank equivalent to the [[Court of Appeals of the Philippines|Court of Appeals]] and the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]], which houses the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|lower house of the Philippine Congress]]. Schools within the Commonwealth area include the [[School of the Holy Spirit]], Our Lady of Mercy School, Diliman Preparatory School, The Seed Montessori, Mary the Queen College, Capitol Hills Christian School, and the Asian Institute of Computer Studies. Ironically, this is also an area of sheer contrasts and a display of the acute economic differences in [[Metro Manila]], with kilometers of [[shanty town|shanty houses]] aligning the avenue on both sides. Parts of these are often being demolished just to be re-occupied by informal settlers soon after.\n\n=== Cubao ===\n[[File:Smart Araneta Coliseum - Basketball configuration - wideshot - 2016 (30183917215).jpg|thumb|right|[[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], one of the biggest indoor domes in the world]]\n[[File:Cubao area with Araneta Center (Quezon City)(2017-10-21).jpg|thumb|right|Cubao Skyline in 2017.]]\nCubao, south of Diliman is an important commercial area.

He was made the first Marquis of Novaliches, a title bestowed with Grandeza de Espana ([[Grandee of Spain]]--- first class rank among the nobility), in the 1840s. Novaliches or \"New Liches\" came from an old district of Granada, Spain also known as \"Liches\" where Manuel and his ancestors, the Pav\u00edas, originate. By the early 1850s, he reluctantly accepted the post of [[Governor General of the Philippines]]. He ruthlessly crushed the rebellion started by Jos\u00e9 Cuesta of [[Cavite]], a Spanish mestizo who rounded ''carbineros'' and natives to fight the Spanish military government.\n\nNovaliches is Quezon City's northernmost district and is primarily residential.

Quezon City is not located in, and should not be confused with, [[Quezon (province)|Quezon Province]], which was also named after the president.\n\nQuezon City hosts a number of government offices, the most important of which are the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]] (the seat of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]], the [[lower chamber]] of the [[Congress of the Philippines|Philippine Congress]]), and the [[Quezon City Reception House]] (the current seat of the [[Vice President of the Philippines]]).<ref name=\"qcpubliclibrary.org\" /> Quezon City also serves as home to the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]]\u2014the national university\u2014and [[Ateneo de Manila University]].\n\nAlso located in Quezon City is the [[Quezon Memorial Circle]], a [[national park]]. The park is an ellipse bounded by [[Elliptical Road]]. Its main feature is the [[Quezon Memorial Shrine]], a 66-meter-tall [[mausoleum]] containing the remains of President Quezon and his wife, [[First Spouse of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Aurora Quezon]]. The shrine is considered Quezon City's foremost landmark and is depicted in its city seal.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Manuel L. Quezon (November 1942).jpg|thumb|180px|left|Commonwealth President [[Manuel L. Quezon]].]]\n\nBefore Quezon City was created, its land was settled by the small individual towns of [[Quezon City#San Francisco del Monte|San Francisco del Monte]], [[Quezon City#Novaliches|Novaliches]], and Balintawak. On August 23, 1896, the [[Katipunan]], led by its ''Supremo'' [[Andr\u00e9s Bonifacio]], [[Cry of Pugad Lawin|launched]] the [[Philippine Revolution]] against the [[Spanish Empire]] at the house of [[Melchora Aquino]] in Pugad Lawin (now known as Balintawak).\n\nIn the early 20th century, President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] dreamt of a city that would become the future capital of the country to replace Manila. It is believed that his earlier trip in [[Mexico City]], [[Mexico]] influenced his vision.<ref name=\"QC001\">{{cite web|url=http://www.quezoncity.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&id=319&Itemid=277|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426201638/http://www.quezoncity.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&id=319&Itemid=277|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 26, 2014|title=Milestones in History|author=Web Admin|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"QC002\">{{cite web|url=http://info.philtravelcenter.com/qc-history.php|title=Quezon City Brief History, Philippines (Official Website of PhilTravelcenter.com \u2013 Quezon City Metro Manila, Philippines)|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1938, President Quezon created the People's Homesite Corporation and purchased {{convert|15.29|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}} from the vast [[Quezon City#Diliman|Diliman]] Estate of the Tuason family; this piece of land became known then as ''Barrio Obrero'' (\"Workers' Village\"). The [[National Assembly of the Philippines]] passed Commonwealth Act 502, known as the Charter of Quezon City, originally proposed as \"Balintawak City; Assemblymen [[Narciso Ramos]] and Ramon Mitra Sr. successfully lobbied the assembly to name the city after the incumbent president. President Quezon allowed the bill to lapse into law without his signature on October 12, 1939, thus establishing Quezon City.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" />\n\nWhen Quezon City was created in 1939, the following barrios or sitios: Balingasa, Balintawak, Galas, Kaingin, Kangkong, La Loma, Malamig, Masambong, Matalahib, San Isidro, San Jose, Santol, and Tatalon from [[Caloocan]]; Cubao, the western half of Diliman, Kamuning, New Manila, Roxas, and San Francisco del Monte from [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]]; Balara, Barangka, the eastern half of Diliman, Jesus de la Pe\u00f1a and Krus na Ligas from [[Marikina]]; Libis, Santolan and Ugong Norte from [[Pasig]] and some barrios from [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Montalban]] and [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]] were to be given to the new capital city. Instead of opposing them, the six towns willingly gave land to Quezon City in the belief that it would benefit the country's new capital. However, in 1941, the area within [[Wack Wack Golf and Country Club]] was reverted to [[Mandaluyong]], and Barangka and Jesus de la Pe\u00f1a to Marikina. In addition, the land of [[Camp Crame]] was originally part of San Juan.  On January 1, 1942, President Quezon issued an executive order from the tunnel of Corregidor designating Jorge Vargas Mayor of Greater Manila, a new political entity comprising, aside from Manila proper, Quezon City, Kalookan, Pasay, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Makati, and Para\u00f1aque.  Greater Manila would later be expanded to include Las Pi\u00f1as, Malabon, and Navotas.\n\n[[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japanese]] forces occupied Quezon City in 1942 during [[World War II]]. In October of that year, the Japanese authorities divided the City of Greater Manila into twelve districts, two of which were formed from Quezon City:  Balintawak which consisted of San Francisco del Monte, Galas, and La Loma; and Diliman which consisted of Diliman proper, Cubao, and the University District. In 1945, combined Filipino and American troops under the [[United States Army]], [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]], and [[Philippine Constabulary]], with help from recognized guerrilla units, liberated and recaptured Quezon City in a few months, expelling Imperial Japanese forces.  Heavy fighting occurred near Novaliches, which at that time was in Rizal Province and New Manila which was a [[strongpoint]].  Toward the end of the [[Battle of Manila (1945)|Battle of Manila]], Pres. [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a]] dissolved the Greater Manila Complex, which included the Japanese-created districts of Balintawak and Diliman which had been formed from the prewar Quezon City.\n\nAfter the war, Republic Act No. 333, which redefined the Caloocan\u2013Quezon City boundary, was signed by President [[Elpidio Quirino]] on July 17, 1948, declaring Quezon City to be the national capital, and specifying the city's area to be {{convert|156.60|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}. The barrios of Baesa, Bagbag, Banlat, Kabuyao, Novaliches Proper, Pasong Putik, Pasong Tamo, Pugad Lawin, San Bartolome, and Talipapa, which belonged to Novaliches and had a combined area of about 8,100 hectares, were taken from Caloocan and ceded to Quezon City. This caused the territorial division of [[Caloocan]] into two non-contiguous parts, the South section being the more urbanized part, and the North half being sub-rural. On June 16, 1950, the Quezon City Charter was revised by Republic Act No. 537, changing the city's boundaries to an area of {{convert|153.59|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" /> Exactly six years after on June 16, 1956, more revisions to the city's land area were made by Republic Act No. 1575, which defined its area as {{convert|151.06|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}. According to the [[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] and [[Geoscience Australia]] on their study earthquake impact and risk assessment on the Greater Metropolitan Manila Area, the total area of Quezon City stood at {{convert|165.33|km\u00b2|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"arearef1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.mbc.com.ph/engine/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Solidum-Update-of-Earthquake-Hazards-and-Risk-Assessment-of-MMla-14Nov2013.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624134051/http://www.mbc.com.ph/engine/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Solidum-Update-of-Earthquake-Hazards-and-Risk-Assessment-of-MMla-14Nov2013.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 24, 2016 |title=An Update on the Earthquake Hazards and Risk Assessment of Greater Metropolitan Manila Area |publisher=[[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] |date=November 14, 2013 |accessdate=May 16, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"arearef2\">{{cite web |url=http://ndrrmc.gov.ph/attachments/article/1509/Component_5_Earthquake_Risk_Analysis_Technical%20Report_-_Final_Draft_by_GA_and_PHIVOLCS.pdf |title=Enhancing Risk Analysis Capacities for Flood, Tropical Cyclone Severe Wind and Earthquake for the Greater Metro Manila Area Component 5 \u2013 Earthquake Risk Analysis |publisher=[[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] and [[Geoscience Australia]] |accessdate=May 16, 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn October 1, 1975, Quezon City was the actual site of the \"[[Thrilla in Manila]]\" boxing fight between [[Muhammad Ali]] and [[Joe Frazier]], which took place at the [[Araneta Coliseum]]. It was renamed as the \"Philippine Coliseum\" for the event.\n\nOn November 7, 1975, the promulgation of Presidential Decree No. 824 of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] established Metro Manila.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" /> Quezon City became one of Metro Manila's 17 cities and municipalities. The next year, Presidential Decree No. 940 transferred the capital back to [[Manila]] on June 24, 1976. On March 31, 1978, President Marcos ordered the transfer of the remains of President Quezon from [[Manila North Cemetery]] to the completed [[Quezon Memorial Circle|Quezon Memorial Monument]] within Elliptical Road. On February 22, 1986, the Quezon City portion of the [[EDSA (road)|Epifanio de los Santos Avenue]] (between [[Camp Crame]] and [[Camp Aguinaldo]]) became the venue of the bloodless [[People Power Revolution]] that overthrew Marcos.\n\nOn February 23, 1998, Republic Act. No. 8535 was signed by President [[Fidel Ramos]].<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" /> The Act provided for the creation of the City of Novaliches comprising the 15 northernmost barangays of Quezon City. However, in the succeeding plebiscite on October 23, 1999, an overwhelming majority of Quezon City residents rejected the secession of Novaliches.\n\nQuezon City is the first local government in the [[Philippines]] with a computerized real estate assessment and payment system. The city government developed a database system in 2015 that contains around 400,000 property units with capability to record payments.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" />\n\nThe city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15, 2020 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n=== Master Plans ===\nIn 1938, President Quezon made a decision to push for a new capital city. [[Manila]] was getting crowded, and his [[military advisor]]s (reportedly) told him that Manila, being by the bay, was an easy target for bombing by [[Naval artillery|naval guns]] in case of attack\u2013a real possibility in the late 1930s. Military advisers, however, did not anticipate aerial bombardment.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" />\n\nQuezon supported the idea of a new city at least {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} away from [[Manila Bay]] (beyond the reach of naval guns). He contacted [[William E. Parsons]], American architect and planner, who had been the consulting architect for the islands early in the American colonial period. Parsons came over in the summer of 1939 and helped select the Diliman (Tuason) estate as the site for the new city. Unfortunately, he died later that year, leaving his partner Harry Frost to take over. Frost collaborated with [[Juan Arellano]], engineer A.D. Williams, and landscape architect and planner Louis Croft to craft a grand master plan for the new capital.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" />\n\nThe plan was approved by the Philippine authorities in 1941. The core of the new city was to be a 400&nbsp;ha central green, about the size of [[New York City|New York's]] [[Central Park]], and defined by North, South (Timog), East and West Avenues. On one corner of the proposed Diliman Quadrangle was delineated a 25-hectare elliptical site. This was to contain a large capitol building to house the [[Philippine Legislature]] and ancillary structures for the offices of representatives.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" />\n\nOn either side of the giant ellipse were supposed to have been the new [[Malaca\u00f1an Palace]] on North Avenue (site of the present-day [[Veterans Memorial Medical Center|Veterans Memorial Hospital]]), and the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] Complex along East Avenue (now the site of East Avenue Medical Center). The three branches of government were to be finally and efficiently located in close proximity to each other.<ref name=\"QC001\" /><ref name=\"QC002\" />\n{{go to top}}\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Qc-welcome-rotonda-2010.JPG|250px|thumb|Aerial view of Quezon City with Welcome Rotonda in the foreground]]\nThe city lies on the Guadalupe Plateau, a relatively high plateau at the northeast of the metropolis situated between the lowlands of [[Manila]] to the southwest and the [[Marikina River]] Valley to the east. The southern portion is drained by the narrow [[San Juan River (Quezon City)|San Juan River]] and its tributaries to [[Pasig River]], while running in the northern portions of the city is the equally-narrow [[Tullahan River]].\n\nQuezon City is bordered by [[Manila]] to the southwest, by [[Caloocan]] and [[Valenzuela City]] to the west and northwest. To the south lie [[San Juan, Metro Manila|San Juan]] and [[Mandaluyong]], while [[Marikina]] and [[Pasig]] border the city to the southeast. To the north across Marilao River lies [[San Jose del Monte]] in the province of [[Bulacan]], while to the east lie [[Rodriguez, Rizal|Rodriguez]] and [[San Mateo, Rizal|San Mateo]], both in the province of [[Rizal]].\n\nThe city can be divided into a number of areas. The southern portion of the city is divided into a number of districts including Diliman, Commonwealth, the Project areas, Cubao, Kamias, Kamuning, New Manila, San Francisco del Monte, and Santa Mesa Heights. The northern half of the city is often called Novaliches and contains the areas of Fairview and Lagro. Most of these areas have no defined boundaries and are primarily residential in nature.\n\n=== Climate ===\nQuezon City features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] Aw/Am), with prominent [[dry season]] from December to May, in which in turn, divided into cool and warm dry seasons, and a prolonged [[wet season]] from June to October that brings heavy rains in some areas.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Science Garden, Quezon City (1981\u20132010, extremes 1961\u20132012)\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n| Jan record high C = 34.7\n| Feb record high C = 35.6\n| Mar record high C = 36.8\n| Apr record high C = 38.0\n| May record high C = 38.5\n| Jun record high C = 38.0\n| Jul record high C = 36.2\n| Aug record high C = 35.8\n| Sep record high C = 35.4\n| Oct record high C = 35.4\n| Nov record high C = 35.0\n| Dec record high C = 34.7\n|year record high C = 38.5\n|Jan high C = 29.7\n|Feb high C = 30.5\n|Mar high C = 31.6\n|Apr high C = 33.3\n|May high C = 34.7\n|Jun high C = 33.9\n|Jul high C = 32.4\n|Aug high C = 32.2\n|Sep high C = 32.0\n|Oct high C = 31.5\n|Nov high C = 30.9\n|Dec high C = 29.8\n|year high C = 31.8\n|Jan mean C = 25.2\n|Feb mean C = 25.5\n|Mar mean C = 26.9\n|Apr mean C = 28.5\n|May mean C = 29.7\n|Jun mean C = 29.7\n|Jul mean C = 28.9\n|Aug mean C = 28.8\n|Sep mean C = 28.5\n|Oct mean C = 27.7\n|Nov mean C = 26.5\n|Dec mean C = 25.6\n|year mean C = 27.6\n|Jan low C = 20.8\n|Feb low C = 20.9\n|Mar low C = 22.1\n|Apr low C = 23.7\n|May low C = 24.7\n|Jun low C = 25.5\n|Jul low C = 26.2\n|Aug low C = 26.0\n|Sep low C = 25.6\n|Oct low C = 23.9\n|Nov low C = 22.1\n|Dec low C = 21.4\n|year low C = 23.1\n| Jan record low C = 15.5\n| Feb record low C = 15.1\n| Mar record low C = 14.9\n| Apr record low C = 17.2\n| May record low C = 17.8\n| Jun record low C = 18.1\n| Jul record low C = 17.7\n| Aug record low C = 17.8\n| Sep record low C = 20.0\n| Oct record low C = 18.6\n| Nov record low C = 15.6\n| Dec record low C = 15.1\n|year record low C = 14.9\n|rain colour = green\n| Jan rain mm = 18.5\n| Feb rain mm = 14.6\n| Mar rain mm = 24.8\n| Apr rain mm = 40.4\n| May rain mm = 186.7\n| Jun rain mm = 316.5\n| Jul rain mm = 493.3\n| Aug rain mm = 504.2\n| Sep rain mm = 451.2\n| Oct rain mm = 296.6\n| Nov rain mm = 148.8\n| Dec rain mm = 78.7\n|year rain mm = 2574.4\n|unit rain days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan rain days = 4\n|Feb rain days = 3\n|Mar rain days = 4\n|Apr rain days = 5\n|May rain days = 12\n|Jun rain days = 18\n|Jul rain days = 22\n|Aug rain days = 23\n|Sep rain days = 22\n|Oct rain days = 18\n|Nov rain days = 14\n|Dec rain days = 8\n|year rain days = 153\n|Jan humidity = 70\n|Feb humidity = 66\n|Mar humidity = 63\n|Apr humidity = 67\n|May humidity = 72\n|Jun humidity = 79\n|Jul humidity = 84\n|Aug humidity = 86\n|Sep humidity = 83\n|Oct humidity = 80\n|Nov humidity = 77\n|Dec humidity = 75\n|year humidity = 74\n|source 1 = [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|PAGASA]]<ref name=PAGASAnormals>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180923160054/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasanormvalscigardenqc1981-2010.csv\n| archivedate = September 23, 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-normal-values/resource/020704e9-50eb-4306-8e4b-3d1629dcbd72\n| title = Science Garden Quezon City Climatological Normal Values\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = September 23, 2018}}</ref><ref name=PAGASAextremes>\n{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180923160133/https://data.gov.ph/sites/default/files/pagasaclimextrsciencegardenqc.csv\n| archivedate = September 23, 2018\n| url = https://data.gov.ph/?q=dataset/climatological-extremes/resource/c131837f-7333-4b4c-8b57-1ef300e82de1\n| title = Science Garden Quezon City Climatological Extremes\n| publisher = Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration\n| accessdate = September 23, 2018}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Philippine Census\n| align= right\n| title= Population census of Quezon City\n| 1939 = 39013\n| 1948 = 107977\n| 1960 = 397990\n| 1970 = 754452\n| 1975 = 956864\n| 1980 = 1165865\n| 1990 = 1669776\n| 1995 = 1989419\n| 2000 = 2173831\n| 2007 = 2679450\n| 2010 = 2761720\n| 2015 = 2936116\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}}\n}}\n\nAccording to the 2015 Census, the population of the city was {{PH wikidata|population_total}}, making it by far the [[List of cities in the Philippines|most populous city]] in the Philippines.

In its place, a 22 kilometer rail system will be built. The Line 7 project will commence at North Avenue, connecting the Line 3 at its northern terminus. It will then go through [[Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City|Commonwealth Avenue]], then through [[Regalado Highway|Regalado]], [[Quirino Highway (Quezon City)|Quirino Highway]], ending in [[San Jose del Monte]], [[Bulacan]].

The mayor is the executive head and leads the city's departments in executing the [[Local ordinance|city ordinances]] and improving public services. The vice mayor heads the [[City council|legislative council]] consisting of 24 members. These [[councilor]]s represent the six (6) [[Congressional district|legislative districts]] of the city. The council is in charge of formulating and enacting the city.\n\nQuezon City, being a part of the Metro Manila region, has its mayor in the Metro Manila Council headed by the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] (MMDA). This council formulates development plans that seek to solve the problems and improve the conditions in the [[metropolis]].\n\n=== Mayors ===\n{{Main|List of mayors of Quezon City}}\n[[Manuel Quezon|President Manuel L. Quezon]] acted as mayor from October 12 to November 4, 1939, pending the resignation from another position of his intended appointee, [[Tomas Morato|Tomas B. Morato]]. Since a president can, under Philippine law, hold multiple portfolios inferior to his office, Quezon took the position of mayor in a concurrent capacity. However, it is erroneous to view him as the first mayor, as a president holding a concurrent position is not listed in the roster of incumbents for those offices.\n\n=== Barangays ===\n{{See also|Barangays of Quezon City}}\nQuezon City is made up of 142 [[barangay]]s (the smallest local government units) which handle governance in a much smaller area. These barangays are grouped into the aforementioned legislative districts. Each district, in turn, is represented in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]].\n\n=== Public Order and Safety ===\n[[File:Camp Crame.jpg|thumb|The national headquarters of the [[Philippine National Police]]]]\n[[File:35th National Reservists Week 10.jpg|thumb|right|General Headquarters of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|AFP]] in [[Camp Aguinaldo]]]]\nPeace and order, which includes traffic management of the city is administered by the Quezon City Department of Public Order and Safety,<ref name=\"DPOSQC1\">{{cite web|url=http://quezoncity.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&id=269:dpos|title=Department of Public Order and Safety|publisher=quezoncity.gov.ph|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}</ref> whose offices are found inside the Quezon City Hall Complex,<ref name=\"QCHALL1\">{{cite web|url=http://quezoncity.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=463:qc-gov-dir&catid=92|title=QC Government Directory|author=Administrator|accessdate=September 14, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312103946/http://quezoncity.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=463:qc-gov-dir&catid=92|archive-date=March 12, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> is headed by retired QCPD District Director \u2013 Police Chief Superintendent Elmo San Diego.<ref name=\"DPOSQC1\" />\n\n[[Emergency management]] for the city is administered by the Quezon City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council headed by [[Herbert Bautista|Mayor Herbert Bautista]]<ref name=\"quezoncity\">{{cite web|url=http://www.quezoncity.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&&id=237:policy-statement-on-disaster-risk-reduction-and-environment-management&|title=Policy Statement on Disaster-Risk Reduction and Environment Management|publisher=quezoncity.gov.ph|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}</ref> and Quezon City Disaster Risk Reduction & Management Office<ref name=\"DRMQC1\">{{cite web|url=http://rr-f.ch/research/554|title=QC activates Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office|publisher=rr-f.ch|accessdate=July 25, 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728075422/http://rr-f.ch/research/554|archivedate=July 28, 2014}}</ref> headed by its administrator; Dr. Noel Lansang.<ref name=\"QCHALL1\" /> The QCDRRMO will move out of the DPOS Building once construction of the QCDRRMO Building, near Gate 7 of the City Hall Complex, is completed 4th Quarter of 2014.<ref name=\"DRMQC1\" />\n\nThe National Headquarters of the [[Philippine National Police]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pnp.gov.ph|title=PNP.GOV.PH: Philippine National Police|work=PNP.GOV.PH|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}</ref> is located inside [[Camp Crame|Camp Rafael Crame]] in Santolan, Quezon City and National Headquarters of the [[Bureau of Fire Protection]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bfp.gov.ph/|title=BFP : Bureau of Fire Protection \u2013 To Save Lives and Properties|website=bfp.gov.ph}}</ref> is located in Agham road, Quezon City.

It is headquartered at Barangay Quirino 2-C.\n\n== Districts ==\n[[File:Ph fil quezon city barangay.png|thumb|220px|Political map of Quezon City]]\nQuezon City is divided into six legislative districts, in turn subdivided in a total of [[Barangays of Quezon City|142 barangays]]. Each district is represented by six City Councilors, six representatives/congressmen, one from each district are elected as members of the National Legislature. The number of barangays per district is: District I, 37; District II, 5; District III, 37; District IV, 38; District V, 14; and District VI, 11; Although District II has the fewest barangays, it is the biggest in land area, including the Novaliches Reservoir.\n\nThe [[La Mesa Watershed Reservation]] in Novaliches is the last forest of its size in the metropolis; the La Mesa Dam is an [[earth dam]] whose reservoir can hold up to 50.5&nbsp;million cubic meters and occupying an area of {{convert|27|km\u00b2|0|abbr=out}}, it is also part of the [[Angat Dam|Angat]]\u2013[[Ipo Dam|Ipo]]\u2013La Mesa water system which supplies most of the water supply of [[Metro Manila]].\n\n=== Bagumbayan ===\nLocated at the southeastern corner of Quezon City, Bagumbayan is one of the newly developed commercial areas in Quezon City. The [[Eastwood City]] Business Center is situated here. It consists of several office and residential skyscrapers, including many local IT and consumer electronic firms. Numerous bars and restaurants have been put up since 2000 along [[Circumferential Road 5|E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue (C-5)]]. Many of which are open-air restaurants and coffee shops reminiscent of Paris boulevards, but with a modern architecture. With this, Bagumbayan is fast becoming one of the hippest areas for night entertainment, similar to the [[Malate, Manila|Malate]] and [[Ermita, Manila|Ermita]] districts of Manila.\n\nWest of Bagumbayan are many high-end gated communities like the Acropolis, Blue Ridge, Greenmeadows, White Plains, Corinthian Hills, and Corinthian Gardens. Further west are [[Camp Aguinaldo]] and [[Camp Crame]]. Camp Aguinaldo is the general headquarters of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] while Camp Crame is the headquarters of the [[Philippine National Police]]. Bagumbayan also covers a sliver of [[Ortigas Center]] business district at the southeast corner of EDSA and Ortigas Avenue, where [[Robinsons Galleria]], the [[EDSA Shrine]], and Cyberpod Corinthian are located. It also houses the [[Circulo Verde]] mixed-use development.\n\n=== Commonwealth Avenue ===\n[[File:Batasan front qc.jpg|thumb|The [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]], home to the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]]]]\nNorth of Diliman lies the Commonwealth area, so named because of [[Commonwealth Avenue, Quezon City|Commonwealth Avenue (R-7)]] (formerly called Don Mariano Marcos Avenue) which runs through its center. Barangays in this area include [[Batasan Hills, Quezon City|Batasan Hills]], Barangay Commonwealth, Holy Spirit and Old Balara. This is primarily a residential area home to many subdivisions ([[Homeowner association|residential associations]]), among these are Ferndale Villas, Don Antonio Royale, Don Antonio Heights, BF Homes QC, Ferndale Homes, Vista Real, Filinvest 1 and 2, New Capitol Estates and others. The government center in Quezon City was originally planned to be at what is now the location of the [[Quezon Memorial Circle]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qcpubliclibrary.org/qcmanuscript.php|title=Quezon City Public Library \u2013 Quezonian Newsletter|accessdate=September 14, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924083509/http://www.qcpubliclibrary.org/qcmanuscript.php|archivedate=September 24, 2015}}</ref> but it was then moved further north to where Batasan hills is now. Resultantly, there are important government establishments nearby such as the [[Commission on Audit (Philippines)|Commission on Audit of the Philippines]], the [[Sandiganbayan]], a special court with a rank equivalent to the [[Court of Appeals of the Philippines|Court of Appeals]] and the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]], which houses the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|lower house of the Philippine Congress]]. Schools within the Commonwealth area include the [[School of the Holy Spirit]], Our Lady of Mercy School, Diliman Preparatory School, The Seed Montessori, Mary the Queen College, Capitol Hills Christian School, and the Asian Institute of Computer Studies. Ironically, this is also an area of sheer contrasts and a display of the acute economic differences in [[Metro Manila]], with kilometers of [[shanty town|shanty houses]] aligning the avenue on both sides. Parts of these are often being demolished just to be re-occupied by informal settlers soon after.\n\n=== Cubao ===\n[[File:Smart Araneta Coliseum - Basketball configuration - wideshot - 2016 (30183917215).jpg|thumb|right|[[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], one of the biggest indoor domes in the world]]\n[[File:Cubao area with Araneta Center (Quezon City)(2017-10-21).jpg|thumb|right|Cubao Skyline in 2017.]]\nCubao, south of Diliman is an important commercial area. At its heart is the [[Araneta City]] along [[EDSA (road)|EDSA (C-4)]] and [[Aurora Boulevard]] (R-6). It is a 35-hectare commercial estate owned and developed by the Araneta family. Department stores and retail centers can also be found here, such as [[Gateway Mall (Araneta Center)|Gateway Mall]], Plaza Fair, [[Rustan's]], [[Rustan's|Shopwise Supercenter]], SM Cubao, [[Ali Mall]], and [[Farmers Plaza|Farmer's Plaza]]. At the center is [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]], often called the Big Dome. Many musical concerts, ice shows, circus shows, religious crusades, wrestling, [[cockfighting]], and [[basketball]] games are held in this 25,000-capacity coliseum. In the outskirts of Araneta City is the Cubao Expo,<ref name=\"ourawesomeplanet\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ourawesomeplanet.com/awesome/cubao-expo/|title=Our Awesome Planet: &#91;Travel&#93; Cubao Expo: Secrets of Cubao eXpo|publisher=ourawesomeplanet.com|accessdate=July 25, 2014}}</ref> an artists' colony and site of weekend [[flea market]]s.

Burke is named Chicago-Kent College of Law\u2019s second dean. </blockquote>\n\n*1912\n<blockquote>Chicago-Kent College of Law moves to rented space in the 116 North Michigan Avenue building, where it remains for the next 12 years.</blockquote>\n\n*1918\n<blockquote>Webster H.

Herzog]] is named Chicago-Kent\u2019s sixth dean. During his tenure, the ''Chicago-Kent Law Review'' begins to publish an issue focusing on the work of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The Law Review continued this theme annually for nearly two decades.</blockquote>\n\n*1974\n<blockquote>Chicago-Kent faculty member Lew Collens is named Chicago-Kent\u2019s seventh dean.</blockquote>\n\n*1976\n<blockquote>Chicago-Kent starts the nation\u2019s first in-house, fee-generating law school clinic, in which a faculty of practicing lawyers engage students to work on real cases under the discipline of practice conditions.</blockquote>\n\n*1978\n<blockquote>Chicago-Kent pioneers the three-year legal research and writing program, which is now emulated at law schools across the nation.</blockquote>\n\n*1981\n<blockquote>Chicago-Kent establishes the Graduate Program in Taxation and the Graduate Program in Financial Services Law, the first LL.M. program in financial services law in the United States.</blockquote>\n\n*1983\n<blockquote>Chicago-Kent establishes the Center for Law and Computers, becoming the nation\u2019s first law school to make the computer an integral part of the study of law.

Judge Bailey was selected as  the school\u2019s first dean.</blockquote>\n\n*1894\n<blockquote>[[Ida Platt]] graduates with honors from Chicago College of Law, and soon becomes the first black woman admitted to the Illinois bar--and only the second woman of color admitted to practice law in the United States.

Burke is named Chicago-Kent College of Law\u2019s second dean. </blockquote>\n\n*1912\n<blockquote>Chicago-Kent College of Law moves to rented space in the 116 North Michigan Avenue building, where it remains for the next 12 years.</blockquote>\n\n*1918\n<blockquote>Webster H. Burke \u201903 is named Chicago-Kent\u2019s third dean. </blockquote>\n\n*1923\n<blockquote>''The Chicago Kent Review'' begins continuous publication under the direction of Dean Webster H. Burke. Several years later, it adopted its current name, the ''Chicago-Kent Law Review.''

Herzog]] is named Chicago-Kent\u2019s sixth dean. During his tenure, the ''Chicago-Kent Law Review'' begins to publish an issue focusing on the work of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. The Law Review continued this theme annually for nearly two decades.</blockquote>\n\n*1974\n<blockquote>Chicago-Kent faculty member Lew Collens is named Chicago-Kent\u2019s seventh dean.</blockquote>\n\n*1976\n<blockquote>Chicago-Kent starts the nation\u2019s first in-house, fee-generating law school clinic, in which a faculty of practicing lawyers engage students to work on real cases under the discipline of practice conditions.</blockquote>\n\n*1978\n<blockquote>Chicago-Kent pioneers the three-year legal research and writing program, which is now emulated at law schools across the nation.</blockquote>\n\n*1981\n<blockquote>Chicago-Kent establishes the Graduate Program in Taxation and the Graduate Program in Financial Services Law, the first LL.M. program in financial services law in the United States.</blockquote>\n\n*1983\n<blockquote>Chicago-Kent establishes the Center for Law and Computers, becoming the nation\u2019s first law school to make the computer an integral part of the study of law.

These strictures insinuate themselves into the ambience of everyday life and language, something that poets can observe with careful attention. Here, for instance, is the poet Elena Penga (in Van Dyck\u2019s translation) describing a menace in plain sight: \u00a0\n\nThe cherry trees in the neighbor\u2019s yard haven\u2019t had fruit for years. Four men enter carrying sticks. They enter the neighbor\u2019s yard along with the rain. They\u2019ve come to discipline the trees and chop them down if they don\u2019t blossom. I watch the men hit the trees. I watch the rain hit the men.\n\nA few unadorned sentences weave together several ideas: the sense of failed growth, the coercion that upholds the rule of efficiency, the passivity of the onlooker. Are the men from the government or from a corporation? It seems appropriate that we don\u2019t know. This ordinary violence doesn\u2019t need to be spelled out, it seems to say\u2014it\u2019s right in front of us if we\u2019re merely observant enough to record it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/greek-poetry-in-the-shadow-of-austerity|title=Greek Poetry in the Shadow of Austerity|first=David|last=Wallace|date=June 27, 2017|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref>}}\n\n== Plays ==\nMost of her plays were published in Greek.\n\n* ''\u03a0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1 \u2013 \u0397 \u03b1\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03be'', ([http://greekfestival.gr/festival_events/konstantinos-rigos-2018/?lang=en Pornstar: The Invisible Sex Industry]) 2018.

These strictures insinuate themselves into the ambience of everyday life and language, something that poets can observe with careful attention. Here, for instance, is the poet Elena Penga (in Van Dyck\u2019s translation) describing a menace in plain sight: \u00a0\n\nThe cherry trees in the neighbor\u2019s yard haven\u2019t had fruit for years. Four men enter carrying sticks. They enter the neighbor\u2019s yard along with the rain. They\u2019ve come to discipline the trees and chop them down if they don\u2019t blossom. I watch the men hit the trees. I watch the rain hit the men.\n\nA few unadorned sentences weave together several ideas: the sense of failed growth, the coercion that upholds the rule of efficiency, the passivity of the onlooker. Are the men from the government or from a corporation? It seems appropriate that we don\u2019t know. This ordinary violence doesn\u2019t need to be spelled out, it seems to say\u2014it\u2019s right in front of us if we\u2019re merely observant enough to record it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/greek-poetry-in-the-shadow-of-austerity|title=Greek Poetry in the Shadow of Austerity|first=David|last=Wallace|date=June 27, 2017|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref>}}\n\n== Plays ==\nMost of her plays were published in Greek.\n\n* ''\u03a0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bd\u03bf\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1 \u2013 \u0397 \u03b1\u03cc\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03bc\u03b7\u03c7\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5\u03be'', ([http://greekfestival.gr/festival_events/konstantinos-rigos-2018/?lang=en Pornstar: The Invisible Sex Industry]) 2018.

[[Muqabil Khan]] was the Wazir of Sylhet in 1440. In 1463, Sylhet was governed by [[Khurshid Khan]] who built a mosque near Anair Haor in Hatkhola. Many [[mosque]]s were built during this period such as an [[Adina Mosque]] replica in Dargah Mahalla built by [[Majlis Alam]], the Dastur of Sylhet, in 1472. Alam also built the [[Goyghor Mosque]] in [[South Sylhet]] with his father, Musa ibn Haji Amir. [[Shankarpasha Shahi Masjid]] in Taraf as well as numerous [[dargah]] complexes commemorating [[Shah Jalal]] and his disciples were also built in this period. Alam was succeeded by Muqarrab ud-Daulah and Muazzam Khalis Khan respectively. In 1479, a mosque inscription in Tilapara, Muktarpur mentions another minister by the name of Malik Sikandar. \n\nIn addition, 1486 marked the birth of [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu|Chaitanya]] whose ancestral homes are in [[Golapganj]] and [[Baniachong]]. Hindus believe Chaitanya was a reincarnation of [[Krishna]] and will return during the [[Kali Yuga|Kholi Zug]]. In 1499, a Persian nobleman from [[Isfahan]] known as Prince Sakhi Salamat settled in a rural village in [[South Sylhet]] known as [[Prithimpassa]] (now located in [[Kulaura Upazila|Kulaura]]). Being a wealthy nobleman; his son, Ismail Khan Lodhi, was granted a [[jagir]] by the Mughals and given the status of [[Nawab]] in addition to other prestigious titles. In 1511, [[Alauddin Husain Shah]]'s general Rukun Khan was made the governor of Sylhet. In 1512, Khan enlarged the [[dargah]] of [[Shah Jalal]], according to an ancient [[Farsi|Persian inscription]].<ref>{{cite book|pages=170\u2013171|title=Biographical Encyclopaedia of Sufis: South Asia|last=Hanif|first=N|year=2000}}</ref> Khan was succeeded by Gawhar Khan Aswari.\n\nBhanu Narayan of the ''Ita'' dynasty defeated a rebel of the [[Twipra Kingdom|Tripura Kingdom]].

The Amin would lay down a line, only to find that the Kacharis would fill the ditch up and take all the crops. The Kacharis would also raid Chapghat pargana. The British ordered Badarpur's officer to prevent the intruders from this but they found out that the land in fact belonged to the Raja and not the Amin.\n\nIn 1821, a group of Jaintias kidnapped British subjects attempting to sacrifice them to [[Kali]]. A culprit was then found by the British who admitted that it was an annual tradition which the Jaintias have been doing for 10 years. The priest would cut off the victim's throat and then the Jaintia princess would bathe in his blood. The Jaintia believed that this would bless the princess with offspring. Upon hearing this, the British threatened the Jaintia Raja that they would invade his territories if this does not stop. The Raja made an agreement in 1824 with David Scott that they will only negotiate with the British. A year later, the Jaintias attempted to continue their annual sacrifice which they had previously agreed with the British that they would stop. During the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] in the same year, British troops based themselves at [[Badarpur, Assam|Badarpur]]. They then advanced to Bikrampur in Cachar where they were defeated. In 1826, the [[Kukis]] of [[Pratapgarh Kingdom|Pratapgarh King]] murdered a group of woodcutters and held three hostages after not receiving an annual gift from the Pratapgarh zamindars. The Kukis then sent one hostage to the British to tell them that they must pay a ransom to free the other two, in which the British agreed. \n\nWith the last Khasi raid taking place in 1795, the British experienced another attack in 1827 in Panduah leading to the death of a sepoy, postman and [[dhobi]]. The Agent to the [[Governor-General of India]], [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|William Amherst]], was absent and so the Collector of Sylhet ordered his officer to retaliate with the [[Sylhet Light Infantry]]. After the Nongkhlao massacre in Kanta Kal village two years later, Captain Lister and the Infantry defeated the Nongkhlao Khasis, causing them to retreat and never attack the British or raid villages again.\n\nThe Jaintias kidnapped four British men in 1832. Three were sacrificed in Great [[Hindu temple]] in [[Kanaighat|Faljur]], with one escaping and informing the British authorities of the atrocities.<ref name=heads/><ref>{{cite book|title=The Imperial Gazetteer of India|author=[[William Wilson Hunter]]|year=1886|page=164|publisher=Tr\u00fcbner & Company}}</ref> After the Jaintia Raja declined to find the culprits, the British finally conquered the Jaintia Kingdom and incorporated it into the Sylhet District in 1835.<ref name=allen/> Also in 1835, pargana patowaris were replaced by zillah patowaris and muhuris.<ref name=heads/>\n\nThe [[East India Company]] first initiated their trading of tea in the hills of Sylhet.<ref>Colleen Taylor Sen (2004).

Bahram was succeeded by Ali Quli Baig of Alikulipur (near Badarpur). Baig's leadership was short and Naib Ali Khan became the next faujdar. Ali Khan granted land in 1748 to Kamala Kanta Bhattacharya of [[Beanibazar|Lauta]] and [[Ram Chandra Vidyabagish]] of Dinajpur. He also granted land to Gangaram Siromani of Burunga in 1750.\n\n[[File:1740_Seutter_Map_of_India,_Pakistan,_Tibet_and_Afghanistan_-_Geographicus_-_IndiaMogolis-seutter-1740.jpg|thumb|200px|A 1740 [[Latin]] map of South Asia by [[Germans]] refers to the hilly region as ''Sirote''.]]\n\n== Company rule ==\n[[File:Tea Garden in Malini chora Sylhet Bangladesh (3).JPG|thumb|The Mulnicherra Estate is the oldest tea garden in South Asia]]\nIn 1757, the Nongkhrem-Khairam [[Khasi people|Khasi Raja]] closed the Sonapur Duar, stopping trade between the Jaintia and Ahom kingdoms. An envoy of Jaintias assembled at [[Hajo]] where they informed the incident to Ahom Raja [[Suremphaa|Suremphaa Swargadeo Rajeswar Singh]] who re-opened it for them.<ref name=allen/>\n\nSylhet came under British administration in 1765 and made a part of the [[Bengal Presidency]]. William Makepeace Thackeray was made the first Collector of Sylhet and he was followed by Mr Sumner. Sylhet was strategically important for the British in their pursuit of conquering [[Northeast India]] and [[Upper Burma]]. The British divided the region into four subdivisions further divided into collectory [[Zillah (country subdivision)|zila]]s and then [[pargana]]s. The Qanungohs were abolished for a time during British rule and Wahdadars replaced Choudhuries as local revenue collectors. [[Sylhet District|North Srihatta]] consisted of Parkul, Jaintiapur and Tajpur zilas. [[South Sylhet|South Srihatta]] was made up of Rajnagar, [[Kulaura|Hingazia]] and Noyakhali. [[Habiganj District|Habiganj]] was split into Nabiganj, Laskarpur and Shankarpasha. [[Sunamganj District|Sunamganj]] had one collectory zila at Ramulganj and [[Barak Valley|Karimganj]] at Latu.<ref name=\"purbangsho\"/> During this time, many Western European and [[Armenians|Armenian]] traders migrated to Sylhet and are buried in Sylhet Sadar.<ref name=heads/>\n\nMajor Henniker led the first expedition to Jaintia in 1774. In 1778, after a short term by Mr Holland, the next collector was [[Robert Lindsay (Sylhet)|Robert Lindsay]]. A year into his office, the [[Khasi people|Khasi]] attacked the merchants of Pandua, Bholaganj ([[Companiganj Upazila, Sylhet|Companiganj]]) who were going towards Calcutta after experiencing abuse from other 'Europeans'. Many merchants pleaded Lindsay to build a small brick fort to protect them from further attacks from the Khasi.<ref name=allen/> During the same year, an auction took place in which a purchaser won estates in Balishira ([[South Sylhet]]). With the former owner refusing to give the land, a havildar and ten sepoys were sent to the estate to allow the purchaser his land. The former owner killed two officers and injured many. He then plundered two government boats worth over 2,000 rupees. Reinforcements were sent from Sylhet to Balishira, eventually forcing the former owner to flee. The former owner later returned with a large group of men and attacked the resistance, keeping some as hostage. The former officer and some of his men were later arrested by the authorities in Dacca.<ref name=allen/>\n\nIn 1782, the first ever uprising in the [[Indian subcontinent]] which was against the British rule, the [[Muharram Rebellion]], took place in [[Sylhet Shahi Eidgah]] in which Lindsay killed two of the leaders of the rally, the Pirzada and Syed Muhammad Hadi, with his own pistol. The other leader, Syed Muhammad Mahdi was also killed in the conflict alongside other rebels.<ref name=autobio/> \n\nIn 1783, the headquarters of a [[thana]] was attacked by [[Khasi people|Khasis]] who were provoked by a certain [[havildar]]. The Khasi chiefs demanded the havildar's head which Lindsay refused to give. Many casualties and deaths occurred on both sides, Lindsay's [[Lime plaster|chunam works]] were plundered and his men were said to have been \"cut into pieces\".<ref name=autobio/><ref name=allen/>\n\nIn 1786, the [[Revolt of Radharam]] took place in the [[Pratapgarh Kingdom|Greater Pratapgarh]]. [[Zamindar]] Radha Ram plundered Chargola [[thana]] in Karimganj with the help of [[Kukis]] before escaping. Lindsay reacted by ordering for the burning of Radha Ram's village and the seizing of his cattle. It is said in another incident that the hill tribes attacked the Laur [[thana]], killing 20 people including the [[thana]]dar. In 1787, the Khasis of Laur also rebelled, plundering many [[pargana]]s, such as Atgram, Bangaikunda, Ramdiga, Betal and Selharas, and killing up to 800 people. Before Lindsay's troops could arrive, the Khasis retreated back to their mountains.<ref name=autobio>{{cite book|volume=4|title=Lives of the Lindsays, or, A memoir of the House of Crawford and Balcarres|chapter=Anecdotes of an Indian life: Chapter VII|author=[[Robert Lindsay (Sylhet)|Robert Lindsay]]|url=https://digital.nls.uk/95568541|website=National Library of Scotland}}</ref>\n\nHyndman succeeded Lindsay in late 1787 as the Collector of Sylhet but his term was extremely short and John Willes replaced him.<ref name=heads/> During Willes' office, the Khasi led by Ganga Singh plundered Ishamati thana and [[bazaar]] and killed a Bara-Chaudhri family. In 1789, Willes stationed many sepoys in Pandua (Companiganj). The Khasi however, continued their attacks, killing the thanadar and many sepoys. Two European merchants managed to escape and inform Willes of the incident, who passed it on to the Government at Calcutta. A force was then sent from there, to the village of Pandua although it lead to a bloodless end. Willes also told the government that he really had little control over northern Sylhet as the Khasi chiefs refused every order, would behead the messenger and then continue raiding Sylheti villages as they had done even during the Mughal period. Another Khasi raid took place in 1795 and many years went after that with the Khasis remaining in their hills and not troubling the plains.<ref name=allen/> Willes also changed the administration of Sylhet into ten [[Zillah (country subdivision)|zillahs]], further divided into 164 [[pargana]]s as well as [[Sylhet City|Kusbah Sylhet]]. Revenue was then collected by ten zillahdars assisted by the pargana patowaris. The currency of the Sylhet region was changed from [[Cowrie#Human use|cowries]] to silver coins. During his term, Laskarpur Pargana was also moved from Dacca to Sylhet. Courts were also being established in every zillah.<ref name=heads/>\n\nIn 1799, [[Agha Muhammad Reza]] invaded [[Kachari Kingdom|Cachar]]. With help of [[Naga people|Nagas]] and [[Kukis]], he was able to defeat the barqandaz sent by the Raja of the Kachari Kingdom, and expelled the Raja to the nearby hills. Reza also sent 1,200 men to attack the nearby [[thana]] of the [[East India Company]], administered by one havildar and eight sepoys. The [[Bodo-Kachari people|Kachari army]] then arrived with 300 men and two [[grasshopper cannon]]s but were defeated. During this time, the British were able to gain a reinforcement of 70 sepoys. The army ended up in a brawl between the Kacharis, and the British sepoys eventually drove both groups back leading to 90 deaths in the Kachari side. Reza was later arrested.<ref name=\"purbangsho\"/>\n\nA border dispute started in 1807 between the Khaspur Raja of Cachar, Krishnachandra Narayan, and the Amin Muluk Chand in Badarpur. The Amin would lay down a line, only to find that the Kacharis would fill the ditch up and take all the crops. The Kacharis would also raid Chapghat pargana. The British ordered Badarpur's officer to prevent the intruders from this but they found out that the land in fact belonged to the Raja and not the Amin.\n\nIn 1821, a group of Jaintias kidnapped British subjects attempting to sacrifice them to [[Kali]]. A culprit was then found by the British who admitted that it was an annual tradition which the Jaintias have been doing for 10 years. The priest would cut off the victim's throat and then the Jaintia princess would bathe in his blood. The Jaintia believed that this would bless the princess with offspring. Upon hearing this, the British threatened the Jaintia Raja that they would invade his territories if this does not stop. The Raja made an agreement in 1824 with David Scott that they will only negotiate with the British. A year later, the Jaintias attempted to continue their annual sacrifice which they had previously agreed with the British that they would stop. During the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] in the same year, British troops based themselves at [[Badarpur, Assam|Badarpur]]. They then advanced to Bikrampur in Cachar where they were defeated. In 1826, the [[Kukis]] of [[Pratapgarh Kingdom|Pratapgarh King]] murdered a group of woodcutters and held three hostages after not receiving an annual gift from the Pratapgarh zamindars. The Kukis then sent one hostage to the British to tell them that they must pay a ransom to free the other two, in which the British agreed. \n\nWith the last Khasi raid taking place in 1795, the British experienced another attack in 1827 in Panduah leading to the death of a sepoy, postman and [[dhobi]]. The Agent to the [[Governor-General of India]], [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|William Amherst]], was absent and so the Collector of Sylhet ordered his officer to retaliate with the [[Sylhet Light Infantry]]. After the Nongkhlao massacre in Kanta Kal village two years later, Captain Lister and the Infantry defeated the Nongkhlao Khasis, causing them to retreat and never attack the British or raid villages again.\n\nThe Jaintias kidnapped four British men in 1832. Three were sacrificed in Great [[Hindu temple]] in [[Kanaighat|Faljur]], with one escaping and informing the British authorities of the atrocities.<ref name=heads/><ref>{{cite book|title=The Imperial Gazetteer of India|author=[[William Wilson Hunter]]|year=1886|page=164|publisher=Tr\u00fcbner & Company}}</ref> After the Jaintia Raja declined to find the culprits, the British finally conquered the Jaintia Kingdom and incorporated it into the Sylhet District in 1835.<ref name=allen/> Also in 1835, pargana patowaris were replaced by zillah patowaris and muhuris.<ref name=heads/>\n\nThe [[East India Company]] first initiated their trading of tea in the hills of Sylhet.<ref>Colleen Taylor Sen (2004).
