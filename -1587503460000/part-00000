The series chronicles the adventures of [[Arthur Penhaligon]], an [[asthmatic]] 12-year-old boy who is chosen to become the Rightful Heir of [[The House (The Keys to the Kingdom)|the House]], the center of the universe. The core storyline involves Arthur attempting to defeat [[the Morrow Days]], the criminal Trustees of the House. The series takes place over a span of three weeks (time moves at different speeds at different locations in the series).\n\n==Plot==\nThe series' protagonist is Arthur Penhaligon. The series begins on a Monday, with the main events starting a week later on the next Monday. Each book moves onto the next day of the week, over the course of about three weeks in Earth time, concluding on a Sunday. Each day features beings, collectively known as the Trustees, who each govern a portion of the [[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)|House]], which is the center of the Universe. The Lower House, the Far Reaches, the Border Sea, the Great Maze, the Middle House, the Upper House, and the Incomparable Gardens.\n\nIn the beginning of the first book, Arthur lives a relatively normal life as an [[adoption|adopted child]] in a large and caring family. An asthma attack on a Monday that should have killed him brings him into contact with Mister Monday, who rules the Lower House.  He eventually finds his way to the Lower House himself, where he is to find the cure to a [[Pandemic|plague]] brought to his world by dog faced 'Fetchers'. By convenience, he is declared Heir to the Kingdom and given the Lesser Half of the First Key, which is shaped like the minute hand of a clock. Because of this Key's magical properties, Arthur is relieved of his asthma while in contact with the Key or in the House, and proceeds to a strange and dangerous set of adventures.\n\nAs Arthur discovers, the Will of the [[Characters of The Keys to the Kingdom series#The Architect|Architect]] (creator of the House and the \"Secondary Realms\" that surround it) was not fulfilled as it should have been. Instead, it was broken into seven pieces by the Architect's Trustees, the self-named Morrow Days. The Will was forced to act on its own, and its First Part chooses Arthur to be the Heir to the Kingdom. It thus becomes Arthur's responsibility to recover each of the missing pieces of the Will, defeat each Trustee \u2013 each of whom has been afflicted with one of the [[seven deadly sins]] - claim their domains by taking each Key, and ultimately fulfill the Will.\n\nAfter Arthur has taken each of the seven keys, and the will becomes fulfilled, a huge wave of Nothing dissolves the Incomparable Gardens, Lord Sunday's domain, and the first thing the Architect created. This causes the whole of creation to be destroyed with it including all of the secondary realms (including Earth). Arthur regains consciousness in the void of Nothing (as he holds the power of all seven keys, he is unable to be destroyed unless he so wishes), and he meets the Architect, who is revealed to be the Old One and the Will, once split into two parts to govern the house and the secondary realms respectively. When the Architect and the Old One fell out, the Architect chained the Old One eternally. Doing this meant that she could not return to Nothing when she wished, as she had to go as one. The only way to release the Old One was to destroy creation. These terms were laid out in the will.\n\nIn the void of Nothing, the Architect explains this and also explains how she has appointed Arthur as the New Architect. When the Architect finally lets Nothing destroy her, Arthur decides what to do as the New Architect. He uses the ''Com-pleat Atlas of the House'', a magic book which contains all the information of the entire house, to rebuild the house, and the secondary realms exactly as it was a few seconds before its ultimate demise. Unfortunately, as it only \"saved\" the universe a few seconds before its end, only one tiny part of the house remained, containing only a few people. The Great Architect splits himself into two, one part himself and the other part Arthur, whom he lets go back to Earth.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|Characters of The Keys to the Kingdom}}\n*'''Arthur Penhaligon''' \u2013 The 12-year-old boy was chosen as the Rightful Heir of the House by the embodiment of the Architect's Last Will and Testament.\n*'''Suzy Turquoise Blue''' \u2013 A female Piper's Child who chooses to work with the Will and the Rightful Heir.

The House is divided into seven parts, each ruled by a respective Trustee. Each is related to one of the seven deadly sins. These parts include the following.\n\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Lower House|The Lower House]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Mister Monday (character)|Mister Monday]] who is afflicted by Sloth\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Far Reaches|The Far Reaches]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Grim Tuesday (character)|Grim Tuesday]] who is afflicted by Greed\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Border Sea|The Border Sea]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Drowned Wednesday (character)|Drowned Wednesday]] who is afflicted by Gluttony\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Great Maze|The Great Maze]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Sir Thursday (character)|Sir Thursday]] who is afflicted by Wrath\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Middle House|The Middle House]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Lady Friday (character)|Lady Friday]] who is afflicted by Lust\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Upper House|The Upper House]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Superior Saturday (character)|Superior Saturday]] who is afflicted by Envy\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Incomparable Gardens|The Incomparable Gardens]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Lord Sunday (character)|Lord Sunday]] who is afflicted by Pride\n\n==The Keys==\nThe Keys to the Kingdom are seven objects of power given to the Trustees along with command over their [[demesne]]s. It is unknown whether, but implied that, control of the Key is that which gives one control over a demesne and its namesake day in the Secondary Realms. The Key will bond to the rightful owner of a Key, and protect him or her from harm, somewhat from pain but not at all from discomfort. A rightful owner of a Key is an Heir, the Trustee to whom it was originally entrusted, or a Steward. Over time, the use of a Key will irreparably turn a mortal into a Denizen, though it is mentioned that after a few centuries, this process may reverse a little. Because the presence of a Denizen in the Secondary Realms is inimical to mortal life, Arthur attempted to use the Keys as little as possible, as he wishes to remain mortal and return to his family; however, he later realizes that without the keys he would not be alive, and used the powers to protect the Lower House and his home town.\n\nThe Keys hold sovereign power in their own demesne and their day. All other Keys are of equal [[Superpower (ability)|power]] when they are not in their realm. The exception to this is Sunday's Key, which is paramount over the others. They can do much of what is asked of them, such as opening, locking, manipulating, and freezing items. The full powers of the Keys are not known, as of ''Lady Friday''. According to Arthur, the Keys have the ability to kill anything they wish, be it Denizen, mortal, or Nithling. Beings that are none of these, such as the Architect, her consort the Old One, their three sons, and possibly Arthur in later books, may be immune.\n\n*'''The First Key''' can be separated into two Keys, taking the forms of the minute and hour hands of a clock. The Hour Hand is more powerful than the Minute Hand, but the Minute Hand is quicker and can be used more often. When combined, they make the First Key and take the form of a [[sword]] which bears some resemblance to the clock hands, having a [[silver]] and [[gold]]en [[blade]]. It gives dominion over the Lower House and Monday.\n*'''The Second Key''' takes the form of two large silver [[Gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]]s (gloves when Dame Primus wears it), laced with gold, which were used by Grim Tuesday to form objects and creatures from Nothing. It gives dominion over the Far Reaches and Tuesday.\n*'''The Third Key''' takes the form of a [[trident]] that is capable of increasing and decreasing its size. Drowned Wednesday once used it as a fork. Wednesday's use of the Key was limited keeping her from becoming any bigger than the massive 126-mile long [[Leviathan]]esque [[whale]] she has become after her failed attempt to fulfill the Will and the subsequent betrayal by the Morrow Days (with the exception of Monday, who was incapacitated by his [[seven deadly sins|sloth]]). It was used by the Will to control the borders of the Border Sea that were spilling out into the Secondary (mortal) Realms and in battle to remove the inherent water from others' bodies. It gives dominion over the Border Sea and Wednesday.\n*'''The Fourth Key''' takes the form of a [[Marshal]]'s baton, white and glowing green, and wrapped in gold [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] leaves, but it can take on the form of any weapon depending on its wielder, notably a [[broadsword]] when used by Sir Thursday, and a [[rapier]] for when Arthur fights. It gives dominion over the Great Maze, the Glorious Army of the Architect and Thursday.\n*'''The Fifth Key''' takes the form of a bright silver [[mirror]]. Using it, one can travel to any reflective surface in existence, provided the owner of the Fifth Key has been there before by other means. So far, it is the only Key that has been used in a way other than to accomplish a mundane task; it is able to drain the [[experience]]s from mortals, which Friday can then absorb, enabling her to experience mortal emotions for a short time. Experiences can also be returned to mortals (as shown in ''Lady Friday'', wherein Arthur does so), within a time limit, by one who can control the Key's power.  It gives dominion over the Middle House and Friday.\n*'''The Sixth Key''' takes the form of a [[quill]] pen. It can be used to write extremely powerful spells that are capable of creating illusions and wiping out large numbers of the creatures of the Incomparable Gardens, among other things. Saturday is also seen combining the power of the Key with ordinary sorcery. It gives dominion over the Upper House and Saturday.\n*'''The Seventh Key''' takes the form of a small, golden [[Key (lock)|key]]. Unlike the other Keys, this Key is paramount, retaining its full, sovereign power anywhere in the House or Secondary Realms. Among its powers seem to be the ability to suppress the powers of other keys, and confer a greater power upon the wielder. It gives dominion over the Incomparable Gardens and Sunday.\n\n==Nothing==\nNothing is the mythical substance used in the series. From it the entire Universe formed through a [[concentration]]-based process. It appears as oily black smoke, or a black liquid, and contains the properties of being able to dissolve (with the exception of Immaterial objects) or create anything.  When enough Nothing comes together, it can form a Nithling. [[Nithlings]] are creatures not created by the Architect, but self-made from uncontained or uncontrolled Nothing. The Nithlings have this [[autonomy]] in common with both the Architect and the Old One, but apparently lack the power and creative impulses demonstrated by those elder beings. Nothing is likely based on [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]].\nFor more information on the various types of Nithling, see below.\n\n==Nithlings==\nNithlings are entities formed from Nothing. They are feared by most of the House due to their ability to kill even an immortal [[Denizens of the House|Denizen]] with a festering bite.\nNithlings take a variety of [[shape]]s and are incorporated into every book in some form. They appear to lack complex [[intelligence]], although some types can be used as servants (notably the Fetchers, sent to retrieve the Key in Book One). Most lower forms of Nithling can be dispatched with silver or [[salt]], though this has little effect on higher or more substantially Made Nithlings.\n\nNithlings dissolve into Nothing when killed. They are employed by many Denizens and the Morrow Days for menial tasks, especially when someone is needed to venture into the Secondary Realms. Nithling [[species]] usually are [[name]]d; this implies that they are usually made in regular forms.\nThe Nithlings seen so far in the books are:\n*Fetchers (''Mister Monday'', ''Lady Friday'') \u2013 resembling men with the faces of [[bloodhound]]s, sent to retrieve objects. Fetchers cannot cross thresholds uninvited. They can be banished with salt, which causes them to dissolve, and are forbidden to wear wings or carry weapons.\n*Bibliophages (''Mister Monday'') \u2013 a [[snake]]-like Nithling, expelling a [[venom]] that reduces any kind of writing to Nothing. They are attracted to writing, which they then try to destroy.\n*Spirit-Eater (''Grim Tuesday'', ''Drowned Wednesday'', ''Sir Thursday'') \u2013 a creature made by sorceries and a [[seed]] item belonging to the person whose physical form it assumes, being designed to imitate them. It requires a year of House Time to grow from Nothing. It can grow mentally conducive [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] on people and can only be destroyed if its seed item is plunged into Nothing. The mold originates from the (fictional) planet called Avraxyn; its mutant form, present in Spirit-Eaters, is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact between and only between the Spirit-Eater and natural beings, wherein after it communicates knowledge of its model to the former. A Spirit-Eater's true form varies and can only be seen through a veil of raindrops on a sunny day. At all other times, it resembles its model. Its technical name is 'Cocigrue', which it shares with a legendary monster called ''Cocquigrue'' or ''Coquecigrue''.\n*Scoucher (''Grim Tuesday'') \u2013 a Nithling originating from small, semi-enclosed [[space]]s. Can take any form, but always has long, sharp, ribbon-like [[tentacle]]s, with which it causes mortals or Denizens to bleed uncontrollably. It then obtains strength from their blood. Silver, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium and platinum can kill a Scoucher upon contact.\n*Feverfew's [[Cormorant]]s (''Drowned Wednesday'') \u2013 heralds that communicate to the [[pirate]] Feverfew that his treasures have been breached.\n*Feverfew (''Drowned Wednesday'') \u2013 Part Nithling, part human, this cruel pirate sails on the Border Sea. He is eventually killed while fighting Lord Arthur.\n*Gore-Draken (''Drowned Wednesday'') \u2013 A rare type of Nithling created when certain lost items come into contact with Nothing.\n*Not-Horse (''Sir Thursday'', ''Lord Sunday'') \u2013 A Near Creation made in the workshops of Grim Tuesday. Not-Horses are red-eyed equines having a metallic skin, three clawed toes on each foot, discerning intelligence, personalities suited for battle, and the ability to march in step with each other. They are used as beasts of burden by the Glorious Army of the Architect, particularly by the pseudo- Mongol division thereof known as the Horde. Other versions of Not-Horses include Winged Not-Horses as in ''Lord Sunday.''\n*New Nithlings or Newniths (''Sir Thursday'', ''Lady Friday'', ''Superior Saturday'',''Lord Sunday'') \u2013 Creatures created by the Piper in vast numbers to invade and conquer the [[Great Maze]].  The Piper made them as \"new Denizens\", incorporating as many mortal traits as he could. New Nithlings are much more docile then regular Nithlings. They possess creative impulses and the ability to adapt; without the Piper's leadership, he has said, they would probably prefer to become farmers.\n*Nightsweeper (''Mister Monday'') \u2013 A Nithling taking the form of a tiny horse whose sole purpose is to spend one night gathering any contamination that has emanated from the House into the Secondary Realms, with which it then becomes Nothing.\n*Soot, Grim Tuesday's Eyebrow (''Grim Tuesday'') \u2013 One of Tuesday's eyebrows, which was blown from its face when he was experimenting with Nothing. It was blasted into the Pit, where accumulation of Nothing upon it made it strong, mobile, and self-aware.\n*Grannow-Hoinch (''Lady Friday'') \u2013 a monstrous creature consisting of pure Nothing contained within a silver armature or framework. It resembles a combination of a wild boar and a [[Unicorn]], having a six-foot horn. It is black, and has no visible eyes or mouth. It is extremely aggressive, and will go to great lengths to defeat its opponent.\n*Elephant (''Lord Sunday'') \u2013 Arthur's stuffed elephant which, while Arthur was trying to break free from a clock face and thinking of the elephant, was animated by residual powers of the Fifth and Sixth Keys and grew to the size of a large dog with sharp tusks.\nNote: There is some question on whether all of the above species classify as Nithlings, shown in ''Mister Monday'', when the ''Atlas'' says (in reference to creating Fetchers) \"...it is not the high treason of treating with the Nithlings, those self-willed things that occasionally emerge from Nothing\". This seems to imply that species ''created'' by someone are not true Nithlings, as a true Nithling is self-made.\n\n==Religious, cultural, and literary references==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}\nThe Keys to the Kingdom appears to contain many examples of religious symbolism and references, possibly as a reference to the idea that not even the architect is as creative as humans, particularly in [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition. One example is the title of the series, a reference to the words spoken by [[Jesus Christ]] to the [[Apostle Peter]] in the [[Bible]] at Matthew 16:19 - \"I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven\".  Another example is the affliction of each Morrow Day with one of the [[seven deadly sins]] that results from their choice not to obey the Will.\n\n*Mister Monday: [[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]]\n*Grim Tuesday: [[Greed (deadly sin)|Greed]]\n*Drowned Wednesday: [[Gluttony]]\n*Sir Thursday: [[Wrath]]\n*Lady Friday: [[Lust]]\n*Superior Saturday: [[Envy]]\n*Lord Sunday: [[Pride]]\n\nOther religious references include the Old One, a [[Prometheus]]-like character who held great power but was chained and punished by the Architect for his interference with Her creations, including the liver being chopped out and regrown before the 'eagles' come back again, only difference is that it is clockwork characters and they only chopped the liver previously, now they do eyeballs. (alternatively seen as a [[Lucifer]] character). However, the revelation in the final installment that the Old One was split from the entity of the Architect, and retained her powers, strongly suggest that he is a reference to God. The Drasil trees' name resembles that of the Norse \"World Tree\", [[Yggdrasil]]. \nThere is even a range of literary and mythological reference in the series: Mister Monday's butler is compared to Nestor of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''; a character describes Monday's Noon as exactly how she imagined [[Jane Austen]]'s [[Mr Darcy]]; the Piper is a re-creation of the legendary [[Pied Piper of Hamelin]], who with his music led a population of rats from a city, later to do the same to the town's children, whose parents had refused to pay him the promised fee. The Mariner is likely a reference to the title character of the ballad ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].  Both the mariner of the book and the one of the poem had shot a bird and suffered misery as a result, though [[Garth Nix]] does not specify what type of bird the mariner in his book had shot. In addition, the name \"Artful Loungers\", used for Superior Saturday's servants, may be a reference to \"Artful Dodger\", the name of a street thief in Charles Dickens' novel [[Oliver Twist]]. References to Dickens and the society wherein he lived are also implied in the personalities of the Piper's Children and in the Denizens' clothes. In ''Drowned Wednesday'', Arthur suggests that a passage may open 'through the wardrobe', which is most likely a reference to the wardrobe in ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', through which the protagonist children enter Narnia. The same book also includes an \"exchange of blows\" wherein each fighter tries to kill each other by means of one strike only, similar to the challenge issued by the [[Green Knight]]. Also, the Incomparable Gardens may represent the Garden of Eden,and Saturday's Tower would be analogous to the Tower of Babel, an attempt to reach Heaven.\n\nThe character of Lord Sunday who claims that his only wish is to care for his garden may be a reference to [[Candide]], who decides that \"we must all tend to our gardens\".\nIn addition, the three sons of the Architect and the Old One may reference the Holy Trinity, the Father (Lord Sunday), the Son (The Mariner), and the Holy Spirit (The Piper), as well as the three Greek gods Zeus (Lord Sunday), Poseidon (The Mariner), and Hades (Pied Piper; he was banished to the Void of Nothing)\n\nAnother cultural reference is the usage of the name [[Seven Dials, London|Seven Dials]] to describe the Lower House's transport into the Secondary Realms. The Seven Dials is a large conjunction of roads in the West End of London.\n\nArthur's name implies reference to archetypes: [[Arthur Penhaligon]] might be a play on [[Arthur Pendragon]], who is otherwise known as [[King Arthur]]. A pun to this is that he is known as Lord Arthur, by some Denizens. The \"Return of the Pendragon\", a supposedly prophesied idea wherein King Arthur would return from the land of the dead and bring a [[golden age]] to the Earth, may be implied here; Lord Arthur of the House represents the Pendragon, in which role he restores balance to the House and thence to the Universe.\n\nThe metal gloves of Grim Tuesday may be a reference to J\u00e1rngreipr, a pair of metal gloves that Thor used in Norse mythology. This is made more likely by the fact that Thor used them to catch balls of molten iron, and Arthur and Grim Tuesday used them to catch floating gobbets of Nothing.\n\n==Books in the series==\nThe title of each book refers to the antagonist that Arthur fights in the novel.\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Mister Monday]]\n | year = 2003\n | isbn = 0-00-717501-9\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Grim Tuesday]]\n | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-00-717503-5\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Drowned Wednesday]]\n | year = 2005\n | isbn = 0-00-717505-1\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Sir Thursday]]\n | year =  2006\n | isbn = 0-00-717507-8\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Lady Friday]]\n | year = 2007\n | isbn = 0-00-717509-4\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Superior Saturday]]\n | year = 2008\n | isbn = 0-00-717511-6\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Lord Sunday]]\n | year = 2010\n | isbn = 978-1-74114-591-5\n }}\n\n==Possible film adaptation==\nIn an interview, Garth Nix said that he was willing to sell the rights to studios and directors for an adaptation of the series, if they were \"the right person\".\nHis reason is that he does not want to sell it to any studio over concerns that the studio would ruin the film.<ref>[http://www.kidsreads.com/authors/au-nix-garth.asp Author News & Interviews | Kidsreads<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\nAt the 2012 Texas Book Festival, Nix stated that \"(I) have no plans for movies but would like to see a card game.\"\n\nHerschend Entertainment Studios have secured the film and TV rights to The Keys to the Kingdom series. \"Nix will serve an executive producer alongside Julie Phillips, VP of Herschend Entertainment Studios\"<ref>https://deadline.com/2019/05/herschend-entertainment-studios-the-keys-to-the-kingdom-garth-nix-books-acquisition-1202623675/#!</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Seven Deadly Sins]]\n* [[Seven Heavenly Virtues]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110930064222/http://www.keystothekingdom.com.au/]\n* Book: Keys to the Kingdom (series)7 books (Mister Monday, Grim Tuesday, Drowned Wednesday, Sir Thursday, Lady Friday, Superior Saturday, Lord Sunday)\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050318112739/http://www.scifan.com/series/series.asp?SR_seriesid=4244 Series listing] at SciFan\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110930064222/http://www.keystothekingdom.com.au/ Allen and Unwin - Keys to the Kingdom]\n\n{{Garth Nix}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keys to the Kingdom, The}}\n[[Category:The Keys to the Kingdom| ]]\n[[Category:Series of children's books]]\n[[Category:Seven deadly sins in popular culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{Distinguish|The Keys of the Kingdom}}\n{{About|the book series|the song|Keys to the Kingdom}}\n{{italic title}}\n{{cleanup book|date=February 2011}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox book series\n| name = The Keys to the Kingdom\n| books = [[Mister Monday]]<br />[[Grim Tuesday]]<br />[[Drowned Wednesday]]<br />[[Sir Thursday]]<br />[[Lady Friday]]<br />[[Superior Saturday]]<br />[[Lord Sunday]]\n| image =Copy of Keys To the Kingdom.JPG\n| caption = Scholastic Inc.

The series chronicles the adventures of [[Arthur Penhaligon]], an [[asthmatic]] 12-year-old boy who is chosen to become the Rightful Heir of [[The House (The Keys to the Kingdom)|the House]], the center of the universe. The core storyline involves Arthur attempting to defeat [[the Morrow Days]], the criminal Trustees of the House. The series takes place over a span of three weeks (time moves at different speeds at different locations in the series).\n\n==Plot==\nThe series' protagonist is Arthur Penhaligon. The series begins on a Monday, with the main events starting a week later on the next Monday. Each book moves onto the next day of the week, over the course of about three weeks in Earth time, concluding on a Sunday. Each day features beings, collectively known as the Trustees, who each govern a portion of the [[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)|House]], which is the center of the Universe. The Lower House, the Far Reaches, the Border Sea, the Great Maze, the Middle House, the Upper House, and the Incomparable Gardens.\n\nIn the beginning of the first book, Arthur lives a relatively normal life as an [[adoption|adopted child]] in a large and caring family. An asthma attack on a Monday that should have killed him brings him into contact with Mister Monday, who rules the Lower House.  He eventually finds his way to the Lower House himself, where he is to find the cure to a [[Pandemic|plague]] brought to his world by dog faced 'Fetchers'. By convenience, he is declared Heir to the Kingdom and given the Lesser Half of the First Key, which is shaped like the minute hand of a clock. Because of this Key's magical properties, Arthur is relieved of his asthma while in contact with the Key or in the House, and proceeds to a strange and dangerous set of adventures.\n\nAs Arthur discovers, the Will of the [[Characters of The Keys to the Kingdom series#The Architect|Architect]] (creator of the House and the \"Secondary Realms\" that surround it) was not fulfilled as it should have been. Instead, it was broken into seven pieces by the Architect's Trustees, the self-named Morrow Days. The Will was forced to act on its own, and its First Part chooses Arthur to be the Heir to the Kingdom. It thus becomes Arthur's responsibility to recover each of the missing pieces of the Will, defeat each Trustee \u2013 each of whom has been afflicted with one of the [[seven deadly sins]] - claim their domains by taking each Key, and ultimately fulfill the Will.\n\nAfter Arthur has taken each of the seven keys, and the will becomes fulfilled, a huge wave of Nothing dissolves the Incomparable Gardens, Lord Sunday's domain, and the first thing the Architect created. This causes the whole of creation to be destroyed with it including all of the secondary realms (including Earth). Arthur regains consciousness in the void of Nothing (as he holds the power of all seven keys, he is unable to be destroyed unless he so wishes), and he meets the Architect, who is revealed to be the Old One and the Will, once split into two parts to govern the house and the secondary realms respectively. When the Architect and the Old One fell out, the Architect chained the Old One eternally. Doing this meant that she could not return to Nothing when she wished, as she had to go as one. The only way to release the Old One was to destroy creation. These terms were laid out in the will.\n\nIn the void of Nothing, the Architect explains this and also explains how she has appointed Arthur as the New Architect. When the Architect finally lets Nothing destroy her, Arthur decides what to do as the New Architect. He uses the ''Com-pleat Atlas of the House'', a magic book which contains all the information of the entire house, to rebuild the house, and the secondary realms exactly as it was a few seconds before its ultimate demise. Unfortunately, as it only \"saved\" the universe a few seconds before its end, only one tiny part of the house remained, containing only a few people. The Great Architect splits himself into two, one part himself and the other part Arthur, whom he lets go back to Earth.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|Characters of The Keys to the Kingdom}}\n*'''Arthur Penhaligon''' \u2013 The 12-year-old boy was chosen as the Rightful Heir of the House by the embodiment of the Architect's Last Will and Testament.\n*'''Suzy Turquoise Blue''' \u2013 A female Piper's Child who chooses to work with the Will and the Rightful Heir.

His harpoon is based on the [[Lance of Longinus|spear]] used by the soldier who stabbed [[Jesus]], one of the relics connected to the [[Holy Grail]].\n*'''The Piper''' \u2013 The third son of the Architect, who is able to take control of the Piper's Children he brought into the House with his pipes.  He is the creator and leader of the New Nithlings, and intends to take control of the House.  The piper is based on the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin]].\n*'''Pravuil''' \u2013 A spy trying to kill Arthur all the way through his campaign, serving under all seven of the trustees.\n\n==The House and The Morrow Days==\n{{Main|The House (The Keys to the Kingdom)}}\n<!----DO NOT EDIT ANY PART OF THIS SECTION WITHOUT DISCUSSING FIRST AT THE TALK PAGE---->\nThe House is the first creation of the Architect and its purpose is to record and acknowledge the events of the Secondary Realms, essentially making it the epicentre of the Universe. The House is divided into seven parts, each ruled by a respective Trustee. Each is related to one of the seven deadly sins. These parts include the following.\n\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Lower House|The Lower House]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Mister Monday (character)|Mister Monday]] who is afflicted by Sloth\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Far Reaches|The Far Reaches]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Grim Tuesday (character)|Grim Tuesday]] who is afflicted by Greed\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Border Sea|The Border Sea]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Drowned Wednesday (character)|Drowned Wednesday]] who is afflicted by Gluttony\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Great Maze|The Great Maze]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Sir Thursday (character)|Sir Thursday]] who is afflicted by Wrath\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Middle House|The Middle House]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Lady Friday (character)|Lady Friday]] who is afflicted by Lust\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Upper House|The Upper House]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Superior Saturday (character)|Superior Saturday]] who is afflicted by Envy\n*[[The House (Keys to the Kingdom)#The Incomparable Gardens|The Incomparable Gardens]] \u2013 Ruled by [[Lord Sunday (character)|Lord Sunday]] who is afflicted by Pride\n\n==The Keys==\nThe Keys to the Kingdom are seven objects of power given to the Trustees along with command over their [[demesne]]s. It is unknown whether, but implied that, control of the Key is that which gives one control over a demesne and its namesake day in the Secondary Realms. The Key will bond to the rightful owner of a Key, and protect him or her from harm, somewhat from pain but not at all from discomfort. A rightful owner of a Key is an Heir, the Trustee to whom it was originally entrusted, or a Steward. Over time, the use of a Key will irreparably turn a mortal into a Denizen, though it is mentioned that after a few centuries, this process may reverse a little. Because the presence of a Denizen in the Secondary Realms is inimical to mortal life, Arthur attempted to use the Keys as little as possible, as he wishes to remain mortal and return to his family; however, he later realizes that without the keys he would not be alive, and used the powers to protect the Lower House and his home town.\n\nThe Keys hold sovereign power in their own demesne and their day. All other Keys are of equal [[Superpower (ability)|power]] when they are not in their realm. The exception to this is Sunday's Key, which is paramount over the others. They can do much of what is asked of them, such as opening, locking, manipulating, and freezing items. The full powers of the Keys are not known, as of ''Lady Friday''. According to Arthur, the Keys have the ability to kill anything they wish, be it Denizen, mortal, or Nithling. Beings that are none of these, such as the Architect, her consort the Old One, their three sons, and possibly Arthur in later books, may be immune.\n\n*'''The First Key''' can be separated into two Keys, taking the forms of the minute and hour hands of a clock. The Hour Hand is more powerful than the Minute Hand, but the Minute Hand is quicker and can be used more often. When combined, they make the First Key and take the form of a [[sword]] which bears some resemblance to the clock hands, having a [[silver]] and [[gold]]en [[blade]]. It gives dominion over the Lower House and Monday.\n*'''The Second Key''' takes the form of two large silver [[Gauntlet (gloves)|gauntlet]]s (gloves when Dame Primus wears it), laced with gold, which were used by Grim Tuesday to form objects and creatures from Nothing. It gives dominion over the Far Reaches and Tuesday.\n*'''The Third Key''' takes the form of a [[trident]] that is capable of increasing and decreasing its size. Drowned Wednesday once used it as a fork. Wednesday's use of the Key was limited keeping her from becoming any bigger than the massive 126-mile long [[Leviathan]]esque [[whale]] she has become after her failed attempt to fulfill the Will and the subsequent betrayal by the Morrow Days (with the exception of Monday, who was incapacitated by his [[seven deadly sins|sloth]]). It was used by the Will to control the borders of the Border Sea that were spilling out into the Secondary (mortal) Realms and in battle to remove the inherent water from others' bodies. It gives dominion over the Border Sea and Wednesday.\n*'''The Fourth Key''' takes the form of a [[Marshal]]'s baton, white and glowing green, and wrapped in gold [[Bay Laurel|laurel]] leaves, but it can take on the form of any weapon depending on its wielder, notably a [[broadsword]] when used by Sir Thursday, and a [[rapier]] for when Arthur fights. It gives dominion over the Great Maze, the Glorious Army of the Architect and Thursday.\n*'''The Fifth Key''' takes the form of a bright silver [[mirror]]. Using it, one can travel to any reflective surface in existence, provided the owner of the Fifth Key has been there before by other means. So far, it is the only Key that has been used in a way other than to accomplish a mundane task; it is able to drain the [[experience]]s from mortals, which Friday can then absorb, enabling her to experience mortal emotions for a short time. Experiences can also be returned to mortals (as shown in ''Lady Friday'', wherein Arthur does so), within a time limit, by one who can control the Key's power.  It gives dominion over the Middle House and Friday.\n*'''The Sixth Key''' takes the form of a [[quill]] pen. It can be used to write extremely powerful spells that are capable of creating illusions and wiping out large numbers of the creatures of the Incomparable Gardens, among other things. Saturday is also seen combining the power of the Key with ordinary sorcery. It gives dominion over the Upper House and Saturday.\n*'''The Seventh Key''' takes the form of a small, golden [[Key (lock)|key]]. Unlike the other Keys, this Key is paramount, retaining its full, sovereign power anywhere in the House or Secondary Realms. Among its powers seem to be the ability to suppress the powers of other keys, and confer a greater power upon the wielder. It gives dominion over the Incomparable Gardens and Sunday.\n\n==Nothing==\nNothing is the mythical substance used in the series. From it the entire Universe formed through a [[concentration]]-based process. It appears as oily black smoke, or a black liquid, and contains the properties of being able to dissolve (with the exception of Immaterial objects) or create anything.  When enough Nothing comes together, it can form a Nithling. [[Nithlings]] are creatures not created by the Architect, but self-made from uncontained or uncontrolled Nothing. The Nithlings have this [[autonomy]] in common with both the Architect and the Old One, but apparently lack the power and creative impulses demonstrated by those elder beings. Nothing is likely based on [[Aether (classical element)|Aether]].\nFor more information on the various types of Nithling, see below.\n\n==Nithlings==\nNithlings are entities formed from Nothing. They are feared by most of the House due to their ability to kill even an immortal [[Denizens of the House|Denizen]] with a festering bite.\nNithlings take a variety of [[shape]]s and are incorporated into every book in some form. They appear to lack complex [[intelligence]], although some types can be used as servants (notably the Fetchers, sent to retrieve the Key in Book One). Most lower forms of Nithling can be dispatched with silver or [[salt]], though this has little effect on higher or more substantially Made Nithlings.\n\nNithlings dissolve into Nothing when killed. They are employed by many Denizens and the Morrow Days for menial tasks, especially when someone is needed to venture into the Secondary Realms. Nithling [[species]] usually are [[name]]d; this implies that they are usually made in regular forms.\nThe Nithlings seen so far in the books are:\n*Fetchers (''Mister Monday'', ''Lady Friday'') \u2013 resembling men with the faces of [[bloodhound]]s, sent to retrieve objects. Fetchers cannot cross thresholds uninvited. They can be banished with salt, which causes them to dissolve, and are forbidden to wear wings or carry weapons.\n*Bibliophages (''Mister Monday'') \u2013 a [[snake]]-like Nithling, expelling a [[venom]] that reduces any kind of writing to Nothing. They are attracted to writing, which they then try to destroy.\n*Spirit-Eater (''Grim Tuesday'', ''Drowned Wednesday'', ''Sir Thursday'') \u2013 a creature made by sorceries and a [[seed]] item belonging to the person whose physical form it assumes, being designed to imitate them. It requires a year of House Time to grow from Nothing. It can grow mentally conducive [[mold]] on people and can only be destroyed if its seed item is plunged into Nothing. The mold originates from the (fictional) planet called Avraxyn; its mutant form, present in Spirit-Eaters, is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact between and only between the Spirit-Eater and natural beings, wherein after it communicates knowledge of its model to the former. A Spirit-Eater's true form varies and can only be seen through a veil of raindrops on a sunny day. At all other times, it resembles its model. Its technical name is 'Cocigrue', which it shares with a legendary monster called ''Cocquigrue'' or ''Coquecigrue''.\n*Scoucher (''Grim Tuesday'') \u2013 a Nithling originating from small, semi-enclosed [[space]]s. Can take any form, but always has long, sharp, ribbon-like [[tentacle]]s, with which it causes mortals or Denizens to bleed uncontrollably. It then obtains strength from their blood. Silver, ruthenium, rhodium, palladium, osmium, iridium and platinum can kill a Scoucher upon contact.\n*Feverfew's [[Cormorant]]s (''Drowned Wednesday'') \u2013 heralds that communicate to the [[pirate]] Feverfew that his treasures have been breached.\n*Feverfew (''Drowned Wednesday'') \u2013 Part Nithling, part human, this cruel pirate sails on the Border Sea. He is eventually killed while fighting Lord Arthur.\n*Gore-Draken (''Drowned Wednesday'') \u2013 A rare type of Nithling created when certain lost items come into contact with Nothing.\n*Not-Horse (''Sir Thursday'', ''Lord Sunday'') \u2013 A Near Creation made in the workshops of Grim Tuesday. Not-Horses are red-eyed equines having a metallic skin, three clawed toes on each foot, discerning intelligence, personalities suited for battle, and the ability to march in step with each other. They are used as beasts of burden by the Glorious Army of the Architect, particularly by the pseudo- Mongol division thereof known as the Horde. Other versions of Not-Horses include Winged Not-Horses as in ''Lord Sunday.''\n*New Nithlings or Newniths (''Sir Thursday'', ''Lady Friday'', ''Superior Saturday'',''Lord Sunday'') \u2013 Creatures created by the Piper in vast numbers to invade and conquer the [[Great Maze]].  The Piper made them as \"new Denizens\", incorporating as many mortal traits as he could. New Nithlings are much more docile then regular Nithlings. They possess creative impulses and the ability to adapt; without the Piper's leadership, he has said, they would probably prefer to become farmers.\n*Nightsweeper (''Mister Monday'') \u2013 A Nithling taking the form of a tiny horse whose sole purpose is to spend one night gathering any contamination that has emanated from the House into the Secondary Realms, with which it then becomes Nothing.\n*Soot, Grim Tuesday's Eyebrow (''Grim Tuesday'') \u2013 One of Tuesday's eyebrows, which was blown from its face when he was experimenting with Nothing. It was blasted into the Pit, where accumulation of Nothing upon it made it strong, mobile, and self-aware.\n*Grannow-Hoinch (''Lady Friday'') \u2013 a monstrous creature consisting of pure Nothing contained within a silver armature or framework. It resembles a combination of a wild boar and a [[Unicorn]], having a six-foot horn. It is black, and has no visible eyes or mouth. It is extremely aggressive, and will go to great lengths to defeat its opponent.\n*Elephant (''Lord Sunday'') \u2013 Arthur's stuffed elephant which, while Arthur was trying to break free from a clock face and thinking of the elephant, was animated by residual powers of the Fifth and Sixth Keys and grew to the size of a large dog with sharp tusks.\nNote: There is some question on whether all of the above species classify as Nithlings, shown in ''Mister Monday'', when the ''Atlas'' says (in reference to creating Fetchers) \"...it is not the high treason of treating with the Nithlings, those self-willed things that occasionally emerge from Nothing\". This seems to imply that species ''created'' by someone are not true Nithlings, as a true Nithling is self-made.\n\n==Religious, cultural, and literary references==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2010}}\nThe Keys to the Kingdom appears to contain many examples of religious symbolism and references, possibly as a reference to the idea that not even the architect is as creative as humans, particularly in [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition. One example is the title of the series, a reference to the words spoken by [[Jesus Christ]] to the [[Apostle Peter]] in the [[Bible]] at Matthew 16:19 - \"I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven\".  Another example is the affliction of each Morrow Day with one of the [[seven deadly sins]] that results from their choice not to obey the Will.\n\n*Mister Monday: [[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]]\n*Grim Tuesday: [[Greed (deadly sin)|Greed]]\n*Drowned Wednesday: [[Gluttony]]\n*Sir Thursday: [[Wrath]]\n*Lady Friday: [[Lust]]\n*Superior Saturday: [[Envy]]\n*Lord Sunday: [[Pride]]\n\nOther religious references include the Old One, a [[Prometheus]]-like character who held great power but was chained and punished by the Architect for his interference with Her creations, including the liver being chopped out and regrown before the 'eagles' come back again, only difference is that it is clockwork characters and they only chopped the liver previously, now they do eyeballs. (alternatively seen as a [[Lucifer]] character). However, the revelation in the final installment that the Old One was split from the entity of the Architect, and retained her powers, strongly suggest that he is a reference to God. The Drasil trees' name resembles that of the Norse \"World Tree\", [[Yggdrasil]]. \nThere is even a range of literary and mythological reference in the series: Mister Monday's butler is compared to Nestor of ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''; a character describes Monday's Noon as exactly how she imagined [[Jane Austen]]'s [[Mr Darcy]]; the Piper is a re-creation of the legendary [[Pied Piper of Hamelin]], who with his music led a population of rats from a city, later to do the same to the town's children, whose parents had refused to pay him the promised fee. The Mariner is likely a reference to the title character of the ballad ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]'' by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].  Both the mariner of the book and the one of the poem had shot a bird and suffered misery as a result, though [[Garth Nix]] does not specify what type of bird the mariner in his book had shot. In addition, the name \"Artful Loungers\", used for Superior Saturday's servants, may be a reference to \"Artful Dodger\", the name of a street thief in Charles Dickens' novel [[Oliver Twist]]. References to Dickens and the society wherein he lived are also implied in the personalities of the Piper's Children and in the Denizens' clothes. In ''Drowned Wednesday'', Arthur suggests that a passage may open 'through the wardrobe', which is most likely a reference to the wardrobe in ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', through which the protagonist children enter Narnia. The same book also includes an \"exchange of blows\" wherein each fighter tries to kill each other by means of one strike only, similar to the challenge issued by the [[Green Knight]]. Also, the Incomparable Gardens may represent the Garden of Eden,and Saturday's Tower would be analogous to the Tower of Babel, an attempt to reach Heaven.\n\nThe character of Lord Sunday who claims that his only wish is to care for his garden may be a reference to [[Candide]], who decides that \"we must all tend to our gardens\".\nIn addition, the three sons of the Architect and the Old One may reference the Holy Trinity, the Father (Lord Sunday), the Son (The Mariner), and the Holy Spirit (The Piper), as well as the three Greek gods Zeus (Lord Sunday), Poseidon (The Mariner), and Hades (Pied Piper; he was banished to the Void of Nothing)\n\nAnother cultural reference is the usage of the name [[Seven Dials, London|Seven Dials]] to describe the Lower House's transport into the Secondary Realms. The Seven Dials is a large conjunction of roads in the West End of London.\n\nArthur's name implies reference to archetypes: [[Arthur Penhaligon]] might be a play on [[Arthur Pendragon]], who is otherwise known as [[King Arthur]]. A pun to this is that he is known as Lord Arthur, by some Denizens. The \"Return of the Pendragon\", a supposedly prophesied idea wherein King Arthur would return from the land of the dead and bring a [[golden age]] to the Earth, may be implied here; Lord Arthur of the House represents the Pendragon, in which role he restores balance to the House and thence to the Universe.\n\nThe metal gloves of Grim Tuesday may be a reference to J\u00e1rngreipr, a pair of metal gloves that Thor used in Norse mythology. This is made more likely by the fact that Thor used them to catch balls of molten iron, and Arthur and Grim Tuesday used them to catch floating gobbets of Nothing.\n\n==Books in the series==\nThe title of each book refers to the antagonist that Arthur fights in the novel.\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Mister Monday]]\n | year = 2003\n | isbn = 0-00-717501-9\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Grim Tuesday]]\n | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-00-717503-5\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Drowned Wednesday]]\n | year = 2005\n | isbn = 0-00-717505-1\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Sir Thursday]]\n | year =  2006\n | isbn = 0-00-717507-8\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Lady Friday]]\n | year = 2007\n | isbn = 0-00-717509-4\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Superior Saturday]]\n | year = 2008\n | isbn = 0-00-717511-6\n }}\n* {{cite book\n | last = Nix\n | first = Garth\n | authorlink = Garth Nix\n | title = [[Lord Sunday]]\n | year = 2010\n | isbn = 978-1-74114-591-5\n }}\n\n==Possible film adaptation==\nIn an interview, Garth Nix said that he was willing to sell the rights to studios and directors for an adaptation of the series, if they were \"the right person\".\nHis reason is that he does not want to sell it to any studio over concerns that the studio would ruin the film.<ref>[http://www.kidsreads.com/authors/au-nix-garth.asp Author News & Interviews | Kidsreads<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\nAt the 2012 Texas Book Festival, Nix stated that \"(I) have no plans for movies but would like to see a card game.\"\n\nHerschend Entertainment Studios have secured the film and TV rights to The Keys to the Kingdom series. \"Nix will serve an executive producer alongside Julie Phillips, VP of Herschend Entertainment Studios\"<ref>https://deadline.com/2019/05/herschend-entertainment-studios-the-keys-to-the-kingdom-garth-nix-books-acquisition-1202623675/#!</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Seven Deadly Sins]]\n* [[Seven Heavenly Virtues]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110930064222/http://www.keystothekingdom.com.au/]\n* Book: Keys to the Kingdom (series)7 books (Mister Monday, Grim Tuesday, Drowned Wednesday, Sir Thursday, Lady Friday, Superior Saturday, Lord Sunday)\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20050318112739/http://www.scifan.com/series/series.asp?SR_seriesid=4244 Series listing] at SciFan\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110930064222/http://www.keystothekingdom.com.au/ Allen and Unwin - Keys to the Kingdom]\n\n{{Garth Nix}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keys to the Kingdom, The}}\n[[Category:The Keys to the Kingdom| ]]\n[[Category:Series of children's books]]\n[[Category:Seven deadly sins in popular culture]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keys_to_the_Kingdom"}

While sailing up the [[Congo River]] from one station to another, the captain became ill and Conrad assumed command. He guided the ship up the [[tributary]] [[Lualaba River]] to the trading company's innermost station, [[Kindu]], in [[Maniema|Eastern Kongo]]; Marlow has similar experiences to the author.<ref name=\"Bloom\">{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=15}}</ref>\n\nWhen Conrad began to write the novella, eight years after returning from Africa, he drew inspiration from his travel journals.<ref name=\"Bloom\"/> He described ''Heart of Darkness'' as \"a wild story\" of a journalist who becomes manager of a station in the (African) interior and makes himself worshipped by a tribe of savages. The tale was first published as a three-part serial, in February, March and April 1899, in ''Blackwood's Magazine'' (February 1899 was the magazine's 1000th issue: special edition). In 1902 ''Heart of Darkness'' was included in the book ''[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories|Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories]]'', published on 13 November 1902 by [[William Blackwood]].\n\nThe volume consisted of ''[[Youth (Conrad story)|Youth: a Narrative]]'', ''Heart of Darkness'' and ''[[The End of the Tether]]'' in that order. In 1917, for future editions of the book, Conrad wrote an \"[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories/Author's Note|Author's Note]]\" where he, after denying any \"unity of artistic purpose\" underlying the collection, discusses each of the three stories and makes light commentary on Marlow, the narrator of the tales within the first two stories. He said Marlow first appeared in ''Youth''.\n\nOn 31 May 1902, in a letter to William Blackwood, Conrad remarked,\n\n<blockquote>I call your own kind self to witness ... the last pages of Heart of Darkness where the interview of the man and the girl locks in\u2014as it were\u2014the whole 30000 words of narrative description into one suggestive view of a whole phase of life and makes of that story something quite on another plane than an anecdote of a man who went mad in the Centre of Africa.<ref>{{harvnb|Karl|Davies|1986|p=417}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere have been many proposed sources for the character of the antagonist, Kurtz. [[Georges-Antoine Klein]], an agent who became ill and died aboard Conrad's steamer, is proposed by scholars and literary critics as a basis for Kurtz. The principal figures involved in the disastrous \"rear column\" of the [[Emin Pasha Relief Expedition]] have also been identified as likely sources, including column leader [[Edmund Musgrave Barttelot]], slave trader [[Tippu Tip]] and the expedition leader, Welsh explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=16}}</ref><ref name = \"ho\">{{cite book |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |title=King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-395-75924-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kingleopoldsghos00hoch_1/page/98 98], 145 |url=https://archive.org/details/kingleopoldsghos00hoch_1 |url-access=registration |via=[[Internet Archive]] }}</ref> Conrad's biographer [[Norman Sherry]] judged that Arthur Hodister (1847\u20131892), a Belgian solitary but successful trader, who spoke three Congolese languages and was venerated by the Congolese villagers among whom he worked to the point of deification, served as the main model, while later scholars have refuted this hypothesis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conrad's Western World|last=Sherry|first=Norman|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=95}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coosemans|first=M.|date=1948|title=Hodister, Arthur|url=|journal=Biographie Coloniale Belge|volume=I|pages=514\u2013518|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Envisioning Africa: Racism and Imperialism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness|last=Firchow|first=Peter|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=65\u201368}}</ref> [[Adam Hochschild]], in ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'', believes that the Belgian soldier [[L\u00e9on Rom]] influenced the character.<ref>Ankomah, Baffour (October 1999). \"The Butcher of Congo\".

As a child, Marlow had been fascinated by \"the blank spaces\" on maps, particularly by the biggest, which by the time he had grown up was no longer blank but turned into \"a place of darkness\". Yet there remained a big river, \"resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the land\". The image of this river on the map fascinated Marlow \"as a snake would a bird\". Feeling as though \"instead of going to the centre of a continent I were about to set off for the centre of the earth\", Marlow takes passage on a French steamer bound for the African coast and then into the interior. After more than thirty days the ship anchors off the seat of government near the mouth of the big river. Marlow, with {{convert|200|mi|abbr=on}} to go yet, takes passage on a little sea-going steamer captained by a Swede. He departs some {{convert|30|mi|abbr=on}} up the river where his company's station is. Work on the railway is going on, involving removal of rocks with explosives. Marlow enters a narrow ravine to stroll in the shade under the trees, and finds himself in \"the gloomy circle of some Inferno\": the place is full of diseased Africans who worked on the railroad and now lay sick and gaunt, awaiting death. Marlow witnesses the scene \"horror-struck.\"\n\nMarlow must wait for ten days in the company's Outer Station. He sleeps in a hut. At this station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation, he meets the company's impeccably dressed chief accountant who tells him of a [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Mr. Kurtz]], who is in charge of a very important trading-post, and a widely respected, first-class agent, a \"'very remarkable person'\" who \"'Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together'\". The agent predicts that Kurtz will go very far: \"'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above\u2014the Council in Europe, you know\u2014mean him to be'\".\n\n[[File:VingtAnnees 289.jpg|thumb|Belgian river station on the Congo River, 1889]]\n\nMarlow departs with a caravan of sixty men to travel on foot about {{convert|200|mi|km}} into the wilderness to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he is to captain is based. On the fifteenth day of his march, he arrives at the station, which has some twenty employees and is shocked to learn from a fellow European that his steamboat has been wrecked in an accident two days earlier. He meets the general manager, who informs him that he could wait no longer for Marlow to arrive, because the up-river stations had to be relieved and tells him of a rumour that one important station is in jeopardy because its chief, the exceptional Mr. Kurtz, is ill. \"Hang Kurtz\", Marlow thinks, irritated. He fishes his boat out of the river and is occupied with its repair for some months, during which a sudden fire destroys a grass shed full of materials used to trade with the natives. While one of the natives is tortured for allegedly causing the fire, Marlow is invited in the room of the station's brick-maker, a man who spent a year waiting for material to make bricks. Marlow gets the impression the man wants to pump him and is curious to know what kind of information he is after. Hanging on the wall is \"a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a lighted torch\". Marlow is fascinated with the sinister effect of the torchlight upon the woman's face, and is informed that Mr. Kurtz made the painting in the station a year ago. The brick-maker calls Kurtz \"'a prodigy'\" and \"'an emissary of pity, and science, and progress'\", and feels Kurtz represents the \"'higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose'\" needed for the cause Europe entrusts the Company with. The man predicts Kurtz will rise in the hierarchy within two years and then makes the connection to Marlow: \"'The same people who sent him specially also recommended you'\".\n\nMarlow is frustrated by the months it takes to perform the repairs, delayed by the lack of proper tools and replacement parts at the station. He learns that Kurtz is not admired but rather resented by the manager. Once underway, the journey up-river to Kurtz's station takes two months. The steamboat stops briefly near an abandoned hut on the riverbank, where Marlow finds a pile of wood and a note indicating that the wood is for them and that they should proceed quickly but with caution as they near the Inner Station.\n\n[[File:VingtAnnees 286.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The ''Roi des Belges'' (\"King of the Belgians\"\u2014French), the Belgian riverboat Conrad commanded on the upper Congo, 1889]]\nThe journey pauses for the night about {{convert|8|mi|km}} below the Inner Station. In the morning the crew awakens to find that the boat is enveloped by a thick white fog. From the riverbank they hear a very loud cry, followed by a discordant clamour. A few hours later, as safe navigation becomes increasingly difficult, the steamboat is attacked with a barrage of small arrows from the forest. The helmsman is impaled by a spear and falls at Marlow's feet. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers and causing the shower of arrows to cease. Marlow and a pilgrim (Marlow's word for the European hangers-on in the steamer) watch the helmsman die. In a flash forward, Marlow notes that the [[International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs]] had commissioned Kurtz to write a report, which he did eloquently. A handwritten postscript, apparently added later by Kurtz, reads \"Exterminate all the brutes!\"\n\nAt Kurtz's station Marlow sees a man on the riverbank waving his arm, urging them to land. The pilgrims, heavily armed, escort the manager on to the shore to retrieve Mr. Kurtz. The man from the bank boards the steamboat and turns out to be a Russian wanderer who had happened to stray into Kurtz's camp. He explains that he had left the wood and the note at the abandoned hut. Through conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz can be; how the natives worship him; and how very ill he has been of late. The Russian admires Kurtz for his intellect and his insights into love, life and justice and suggests that he is a poet. He tells of how Kurtz opened his mind and seems to admire him even for his power\u2014and for his willingness to use it. Marlow, on the other hand, suggests that Kurtz has gone mad.\n\nFrom the steamboat, Marlow observes the station in detail and is surprised to see near the station house a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, the manager appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz on an improvised stretcher. The area fills with natives, apparently ready for battle but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher and the natives retreat into the forest. The pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins, where he and the manager have a private conversation. Marlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer; literary commentators say she is Kurtz's mistress.{{citation needed|date=April 22, 2020}} When the manager exits the cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the company's business in the region, that his methods are \"unsound\". Later, the Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the company wants to remove him from the station and kill him and Marlow confirms that hangings had been discussed.\n\n[[File:Arthur Hodister (1847-1892).jpg|thumb|Arthur Hodister (1847-1892), who Conrad's biographer Norman Sherry has argued served as one of the sources of inspiration for Kurtz]]\n\nAfter midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin on the steamer and returned to shore. He goes ashore and finds a very weak Kurtz crawling his way back to the station house, though not too weak to call to the natives for help. Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm but Kurtz only laments that he had not accomplished more in the region. The next day they prepare for their journey back down the river. The natives, including the ornately dressed woman, once again assemble on shore and begin to shout unintelligibly. Noticing the pilgrims readying their rifles, Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly to scatter the crowd of natives. Only the woman remains unmoved, with outstretched arms. The pilgrims open fire as the current carries them swiftly downstream.\n\nKurtz's health worsens on the return trip and Marlow becomes increasingly ill. The steamboat breaks down and while it is stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them away from the manager. When Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; Marlow hears him weakly whisper \"The horror! The horror!\". A short while later, the \"manager's boy\" announces to the rest of the crew, \"Mistah Kurtz\u2014he dead\" . The next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury \"something\" in a muddy hole. He falls very ill, himself near death.\n\nUpon his return to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the \"civilised\" world. Several callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz had entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in. He then gives Kurtz's report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit. Finally Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz's fianc\u00e9e, whom Kurtz referred to as \"My Intended\". When Marlow visits her, she is dressed in black and still deep in mourning, although it has been more than a year since Kurtz's death. She presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz's final words. Uncomfortably, Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz's final word was her name.\n\n==Reception==\nLiterary critic [[Harold Bloom]] wrote that ''Heart of Darkness'' had been analysed more than any other work of literature that is studied in universities and colleges, which he attributed to Conrad's \"unique propensity for ambiguity\" but it was not a big success during Conrad's life.<ref name=\"Bloom2\">{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=17}}</ref><ref name=\"Moore\">{{harvnb|Moore|2004|p=4}}</ref> When it was published as a single volume in 1902 with two novellas, \"Youth\" and \"The End of the Tether\", it received the least commentary from critics.<ref name=\"Moore\"/> [[F.

In 1939 Welles adapted the story for his first film for [[RKO Pictures]], writing a screenplay with [[John Houseman]]. It was intended to be entirely filmed as a POV from Marlow's eyes. Welles even filmed a short presentation film illustrating his intent. It has been reported as lost to history. The project was never realised; one reason given was the loss of European markets after the outbreak of war. Welles still hoped to produce the film when he presented another radio adaptation of the story as his first program as producer-star of the CBS radio series ''[[This Is My Best]]''.

While sailing up the [[Congo River]] from one station to another, the captain became ill and Conrad assumed command. He guided the ship up the [[tributary]] [[Lualaba River]] to the trading company's innermost station, [[Kindu]], in [[Maniema|Eastern Kongo]]; Marlow has similar experiences to the author.<ref name=\"Bloom\">{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=15}}</ref>\n\nWhen Conrad began to write the novella, eight years after returning from Africa, he drew inspiration from his travel journals.<ref name=\"Bloom\"/> He described ''Heart of Darkness'' as \"a wild story\" of a journalist who becomes manager of a station in the (African) interior and makes himself worshipped by a tribe of savages. The tale was first published as a three-part serial, in February, March and April 1899, in ''Blackwood's Magazine'' (February 1899 was the magazine's 1000th issue: special edition). In 1902 ''Heart of Darkness'' was included in the book ''[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories|Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories]]'', published on 13 November 1902 by [[William Blackwood]].\n\nThe volume consisted of ''[[Youth (Conrad story)|Youth: a Narrative]]'', ''Heart of Darkness'' and ''[[The End of the Tether]]'' in that order. In 1917, for future editions of the book, Conrad wrote an \"[[s:Youth: a Narrative, and Two Other Stories/Author's Note|Author's Note]]\" where he, after denying any \"unity of artistic purpose\" underlying the collection, discusses each of the three stories and makes light commentary on Marlow, the narrator of the tales within the first two stories. He said Marlow first appeared in ''Youth''.\n\nOn 31 May 1902, in a letter to William Blackwood, Conrad remarked,\n\n<blockquote>I call your own kind self to witness ... the last pages of Heart of Darkness where the interview of the man and the girl locks in\u2014as it were\u2014the whole 30000 words of narrative description into one suggestive view of a whole phase of life and makes of that story something quite on another plane than an anecdote of a man who went mad in the Centre of Africa.<ref>{{harvnb|Karl|Davies|1986|p=417}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThere have been many proposed sources for the character of the antagonist, Kurtz. [[Georges-Antoine Klein]], an agent who became ill and died aboard Conrad's steamer, is proposed by scholars and literary critics as a basis for Kurtz. The principal figures involved in the disastrous \"rear column\" of the [[Emin Pasha Relief Expedition]] have also been identified as likely sources, including column leader [[Edmund Musgrave Barttelot]], slave trader [[Tippu Tip]] and the expedition leader, Welsh explorer [[Henry Morton Stanley]].<ref>{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=16}}</ref><ref name = \"ho\">{{cite book |last=Hochschild |first=Adam |title=King Leopold's Ghost: A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa |location=New York |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-395-75924-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/kingleopoldsghos00hoch_1/page/98 98], 145 |url=https://archive.org/details/kingleopoldsghos00hoch_1 |url-access=registration |via=[[Internet Archive]] }}</ref> Conrad's biographer [[Norman Sherry]] judged that Arthur Hodister (1847\u20131892), a Belgian solitary but successful trader, who spoke three Congolese languages and was venerated by the Congolese villagers among whom he worked to the point of deification, served as the main model, while later scholars have refuted this hypothesis.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Conrad's Western World|last=Sherry|first=Norman|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=95}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coosemans|first=M.|date=1948|title=Hodister, Arthur|url=|journal=Biographie Coloniale Belge|volume=I|pages=514\u2013518|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Envisioning Africa: Racism and Imperialism in Conrad's Heart of Darkness|last=Firchow|first=Peter|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=65\u201368}}</ref> [[Adam Hochschild]], in ''[[King Leopold's Ghost]]'', believes that the Belgian soldier [[L\u00e9on Rom]] influenced the character.<ref>Ankomah, Baffour (October 1999). \"The Butcher of Congo\".

As a child, Marlow had been fascinated by \"the blank spaces\" on maps, particularly by the biggest, which by the time he had grown up was no longer blank but turned into \"a place of darkness\". Yet there remained a big river, \"resembling an immense snake uncoiled, with its head in the sea, its body at rest curving afar over a vast country and its tail lost in the depths of the land\". The image of this river on the map fascinated Marlow \"as a snake would a bird\". Feeling as though \"instead of going to the centre of a continent I were about to set off for the centre of the earth\", Marlow takes passage on a French steamer bound for the African coast and then into the interior. After more than thirty days the ship anchors off the seat of government near the mouth of the big river. Marlow, with {{convert|200|mi|abbr=on}} to go yet, takes passage on a little sea-going steamer captained by a Swede. He departs some {{convert|30|mi|abbr=on}} up the river where his company's station is. Work on the railway is going on, involving removal of rocks with explosives. Marlow enters a narrow ravine to stroll in the shade under the trees, and finds himself in \"the gloomy circle of some Inferno\": the place is full of diseased Africans who worked on the railroad and now lay sick and gaunt, awaiting death. Marlow witnesses the scene \"horror-struck.\"\n\nMarlow must wait for ten days in the company's Outer Station. He sleeps in a hut. At this station, which strikes Marlow as a scene of devastation, he meets the company's impeccably dressed chief accountant who tells him of a [[Kurtz (Heart of Darkness)|Mr. Kurtz]], who is in charge of a very important trading-post, and a widely respected, first-class agent, a \"'very remarkable person'\" who \"'Sends in as much ivory as all the others put together'\". The agent predicts that Kurtz will go very far: \"'He will be a somebody in the Administration before long. They, above\u2014the Council in Europe, you know\u2014mean him to be'\".\n\n[[File:VingtAnnees 289.jpg|thumb|Belgian river station on the Congo River, 1889]]\n\nMarlow departs with a caravan of sixty men to travel on foot about {{convert|200|mi|km}} into the wilderness to the Central Station, where the steamboat that he is to captain is based. On the fifteenth day of his march, he arrives at the station, which has some twenty employees and is shocked to learn from a fellow European that his steamboat has been wrecked in an accident two days earlier. He meets the general manager, who informs him that he could wait no longer for Marlow to arrive, because the up-river stations had to be relieved and tells him of a rumour that one important station is in jeopardy because its chief, the exceptional Mr. Kurtz, is ill. \"Hang Kurtz\", Marlow thinks, irritated. He fishes his boat out of the river and is occupied with its repair for some months, during which a sudden fire destroys a grass shed full of materials used to trade with the natives. While one of the natives is tortured for allegedly causing the fire, Marlow is invited in the room of the station's brick-maker, a man who spent a year waiting for material to make bricks. Marlow gets the impression the man wants to pump him and is curious to know what kind of information he is after. Hanging on the wall is \"a small sketch in oils, on a panel, representing a woman draped and blindfolded carrying a lighted torch\". Marlow is fascinated with the sinister effect of the torchlight upon the woman's face, and is informed that Mr. Kurtz made the painting in the station a year ago. The brick-maker calls Kurtz \"'a prodigy'\" and \"'an emissary of pity, and science, and progress'\", and feels Kurtz represents the \"'higher intelligence, wide sympathies, a singleness of purpose'\" needed for the cause Europe entrusts the Company with. The man predicts Kurtz will rise in the hierarchy within two years and then makes the connection to Marlow: \"'The same people who sent him specially also recommended you'\".\n\nMarlow is frustrated by the months it takes to perform the repairs, delayed by the lack of proper tools and replacement parts at the station. He learns that Kurtz is not admired but rather resented by the manager. Once underway, the journey up-river to Kurtz's station takes two months. The steamboat stops briefly near an abandoned hut on the riverbank, where Marlow finds a pile of wood and a note indicating that the wood is for them and that they should proceed quickly but with caution as they near the Inner Station.\n\n[[File:VingtAnnees 286.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The ''Roi des Belges'' (\"King of the Belgians\"\u2014French), the Belgian riverboat Conrad commanded on the upper Congo, 1889]]\nThe journey pauses for the night about {{convert|8|mi|km}} below the Inner Station. In the morning the crew awakens to find that the boat is enveloped by a thick white fog. From the riverbank they hear a very loud cry, followed by a discordant clamour. A few hours later, as safe navigation becomes increasingly difficult, the steamboat is attacked with a barrage of small arrows from the forest. The helmsman is impaled by a spear and falls at Marlow's feet. Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly, frightening the attackers and causing the shower of arrows to cease. Marlow and a pilgrim (Marlow's word for the European hangers-on in the steamer) watch the helmsman die. In a flash forward, Marlow notes that the [[International Society for the Suppression of Savage Customs]] had commissioned Kurtz to write a report, which he did eloquently. A handwritten postscript, apparently added later by Kurtz, reads \"Exterminate all the brutes!\"\n\nAt Kurtz's station Marlow sees a man on the riverbank waving his arm, urging them to land. The pilgrims, heavily armed, escort the manager on to the shore to retrieve Mr. Kurtz. The man from the bank boards the steamboat and turns out to be a Russian wanderer who had happened to stray into Kurtz's camp. He explains that he had left the wood and the note at the abandoned hut. Through conversation Marlow discovers just how wanton Kurtz can be; how the natives worship him; and how very ill he has been of late. The Russian admires Kurtz for his intellect and his insights into love, life and justice and suggests that he is a poet. He tells of how Kurtz opened his mind and seems to admire him even for his power\u2014and for his willingness to use it. Marlow, on the other hand, suggests that Kurtz has gone mad.\n\nFrom the steamboat, Marlow observes the station in detail and is surprised to see near the station house a row of posts topped with the severed heads of natives. Around the corner of the house, the manager appears with the pilgrims, bearing a gaunt and ghost-like Kurtz on an improvised stretcher. The area fills with natives, apparently ready for battle but Kurtz shouts something from the stretcher and the natives retreat into the forest. The pilgrims carry Kurtz to the steamer and lay him in one of the cabins, where he and the manager have a private conversation. Marlow watches a beautiful native woman walk in measured steps along the shore and stop next to the steamer; literary commentators say she is Kurtz's mistress. When the manager exits the cabin he pulls Marlow aside and tells him that Kurtz has harmed the company's business in the region, that his methods are \"unsound\". Later, the Russian reveals that Kurtz believes the company wants to remove him from the station and kill him and Marlow confirms that hangings had been discussed.\n\n[[File:Arthur Hodister (1847-1892).jpg|thumb|Arthur Hodister (1847-1892), who Conrad's biographer Norman Sherry has argued served as one of the sources of inspiration for Kurtz]]\n\nAfter midnight, Marlow discovers that Kurtz has left his cabin on the steamer and returned to shore. He goes ashore and finds a very weak Kurtz crawling his way back to the station house, though not too weak to call to the natives for help. Marlow threatens to harm Kurtz if he raises an alarm but Kurtz only laments that he had not accomplished more in the region. The next day they prepare for their journey back down the river. The natives, including the ornately dressed woman, once again assemble on shore and begin to shout unintelligibly. Noticing the pilgrims readying their rifles, Marlow sounds the steam whistle repeatedly to scatter the crowd of natives. Only the woman remains unmoved, with outstretched arms. The pilgrims open fire as the current carries them swiftly downstream.\n\nKurtz's health worsens on the return trip and Marlow becomes increasingly ill. The steamboat breaks down and while it is stopped for repairs, Kurtz gives Marlow a packet of papers, including his commissioned report and a photograph, telling him to keep them away from the manager. When Marlow next speaks with him, Kurtz is near death; Marlow hears him weakly whisper \"The horror! The horror!\". A short while later, the \"manager's boy\" announces to the rest of the crew, \"Mistah Kurtz\u2014he dead\" . The next day Marlow pays little attention to the pilgrims as they bury \"something\" in a muddy hole. He falls very ill, himself near death.\n\nUpon his return to Europe, Marlow is embittered and contemptuous of the \"civilised\" world. Several callers come to retrieve the papers Kurtz had entrusted to him, but Marlow withholds them or offers papers he knows they have no interest in. He then gives Kurtz's report to a journalist, for publication if he sees fit. Finally Marlow is left with some personal letters and a photograph of Kurtz's fianc\u00e9e, whom Kurtz referred to as \"My Intended\". When Marlow visits her, she is dressed in black and still deep in mourning, although it has been more than a year since Kurtz's death. She presses Marlow for information, asking him to repeat Kurtz's final words. Uncomfortably, Marlow lies and tells her that Kurtz's final word was her name.\n\n==Reception==\nLiterary critic [[Harold Bloom]] wrote that ''Heart of Darkness'' had been analysed more than any other work of literature that is studied in universities and colleges, which he attributed to Conrad's \"unique propensity for ambiguity\" but it was not a big success during Conrad's life.<ref name=\"Bloom2\">{{harvnb|Bloom|2009|p=17}}</ref><ref name=\"Moore\">{{harvnb|Moore|2004|p=4}}</ref> When it was published as a single volume in 1902 with two novellas, \"Youth\" and \"The End of the Tether\", it received the least commentary from critics.<ref name=\"Moore\"/> [[F.

In 1939 Welles adapted the story for his first film for [[RKO Pictures]], writing a screenplay with [[John Houseman]]. It was intended to be entirely filmed as a POV from Marlow's eyes. Welles even filmed a short presentation film illustrating his intent. It has been reported as lost to history. The project was never realised; one reason given was the loss of European markets after the outbreak of war. Welles still hoped to produce the film when he presented another radio adaptation of the story as his first program as producer-star of the CBS radio series ''[[This Is My Best]]''. Welles scholar [[Bret Wood]] called the broadcast of 13 March 1945, \"the closest representation of the film Welles might have made, crippled, of course, by the absence of the story's visual elements (which were so meticulously designed) and the half-hour length of the broadcast.\"<ref name=\"Bret Wood\">[[Bret Wood|Wood, Bret]], ''Orson Welles: A Bio-Bibliography''.

It was the second most important national title in East German football after the [[DDR-Oberliga]] championship. The founder of the competition was East Germany's major trade union.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe inaugural FDGB Pokal (generally referred to in English as the East German Cup) was contested in 1949, four years before the initial [[DFB-Pokal]] was played in the western half of the country. The first national cup competition had been the Tschammerpokal introduced in 1935. \n\nEach football club which participated in the East German football league system was entitled to enter the tournament. Clubs from the lower leagues played in regional qualification rounds, with the winners joining the teams of the DDR-Oberliga and DDR-Liga in the main round of the tournament of the following year. Each elimination was determined by a single game held on the ground of one of the two participating teams.\n\nUntil the mid-80s the field of competition was made up of as many as sixty teams playing in five rounds due to the large number of eligible clubs in the country. Beginning in 1975 the final was held each year in the Berliner Stadion der Weltjugend (Berlin's Stadium for World Youth) and drew anywhere from 30,000 to 55,000 spectators.  The last cup final, played in 1991 after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], was a 1&ndash;0 victory by [[F.C. Hansa Rostock|Hansa Rostock]] over [[Eisenh\u00fcttenst\u00e4dter FC Stahl|Stahl Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt]], which drew a crowd of only 4,800.\n\nThe most successful side in 42 years of competition was [[1. FC Magdeburg]] which celebrated seven FDGB Cup wins (including those as SC Aufbau Magdeburg before 1965); one of those wins ultimately led to victory in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1973-74]].\n \nThe only winners of the competition to reach the final of the [[DFB-Pokal]] since the re-unification of the country are [[1. FC Union Berlin]], who appeared in the 2001 German Cup final, but lost 0\u20132 to [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]].  To date, the only other former East German club to appear in the German Cup final is [[Energie Cottbus]].\n\n==Finals==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-31222-0007, Leipzig, SC Wismut gewinnt FDGB-Pokal.jpg|thumb|FDGB Cup 1955]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-94140-0002, Karl-Marx-Stadt, SC Chemie Halle mit FDGB-Pokal.jpg|thumb|FDGB Cup 1962]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0414-0008, Leipzig, FDGB-Pokal, Endspiel, SG Dynamo Dresden - FC Carl Zeiss Jena 1-3.jpg|right|thumb|FDGB Cup 1974]]\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=65%\n|-\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Season\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Winner\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Score\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Runner-up\n|-\n|<center>1949</center>\n|[[SV Dessau 05|Waggonbau Dessau]]\n|<center>1\u20130</center>\n|[[BSG Wismut Gera|SG Gera-S\u00fcd]]\n|-\n|<center>1949\u201350</center>\n|BSG EHW Thale\n|<center>4\u20130</center>\n|[[FC Rot-Wei\u00df Erfurt|BSG KWU Erfurt]]\n|-\n|<center>''1950\u201351''</center>\n|colspan=3 style=background:#efefef|<center>''No competition held in that season.''</center>\n|-\n|<center>1951\u201352</center>\n|[[Dynamo Dresden|SG Volkspolizei Dresden]]\n|<center>3\u20130</center>\n|[[VfB Einheit zu Pankow|Einheit Pankow]]\n|-\n|<center>[[1952\u201354 FDGB-Pokal|1952\u201354]]</center>\n|[[1.

FC Dynamo Dresden - PSV Schwerin 2-1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The last version of the FDGB Cup 1990]]The '''FDGB-Pokal''' (Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund Pokal or [[Free German Trade Union Federation]] Cup) was an elimination football tournament held annually in the former [[East Germany]]. It was the second most important national title in East German football after the [[DDR-Oberliga]] championship. The founder of the competition was East Germany's major trade union.\n\n== History ==\n\nThe inaugural FDGB Pokal (generally referred to in English as the East German Cup) was contested in 1949, four years before the initial [[DFB-Pokal]] was played in the western half of the country. The first national cup competition had been the Tschammerpokal introduced in 1935. \n\nEach football club which participated in the East German football league system was entitled to enter the tournament. Clubs from the lower leagues played in regional qualification rounds, with the winners joining the teams of the DDR-Oberliga and DDR-Liga in the main round of the tournament of the following year. Each elimination was determined by a single game held on the ground of one of the two participating teams.\n\nUntil the mid-80s the field of competition was made up of as many as sixty teams playing in five rounds due to the large number of eligible clubs in the country. Beginning in 1975 the final was held each year in the Berliner Stadion der Weltjugend (Berlin's Stadium for World Youth) and drew anywhere from 30,000 to 55,000 spectators.  The last cup final, played in 1991 after the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], was a 1&ndash;0 victory by [[F.C. Hansa Rostock|Hansa Rostock]] over [[Eisenh\u00fcttenst\u00e4dter FC Stahl|Stahl Eisenh\u00fcttenstadt]], which drew a crowd of only 4,800.\n\nThe most successful side in 42 years of competition was [[1. FC Magdeburg]] which celebrated seven FDGB Cup wins (including those as SC Aufbau Magdeburg before 1965); one of those wins ultimately led to victory in the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1973-74]].\n \nThe only winners of the competition to reach the final of the [[DFB-Pokal]] since the re-unification of the country are [[1. FC Union Berlin]], who appeared in the 2001 German Cup final, but lost 0\u20132 to [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]].  To date, the only other former East German club to appear in the German Cup final is [[Energie Cottbus]].\n\n==Finals==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-31222-0007, Leipzig, SC Wismut gewinnt FDGB-Pokal.jpg|thumb|FDGB Cup 1955]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-94140-0002, Karl-Marx-Stadt, SC Chemie Halle mit FDGB-Pokal.jpg|thumb|FDGB Cup 1962]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-N0414-0008, Leipzig, FDGB-Pokal, Endspiel, SG Dynamo Dresden - FC Carl Zeiss Jena 1-3.jpg|right|thumb|FDGB Cup 1974]]\n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=65%\n|-\n! style=\"width:10%;\"| Season\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Winner\n! style=\"width:15%;\"| Score\n! style=\"width:20%;\"| Runner-up\n|-\n|<center>1949</center>\n|[[SV Dessau 05|Waggonbau Dessau]]\n|<center>1\u20130</center>\n|[[BSG Wismut Gera|SG Gera-S\u00fcd]]\n|-\n|<center>1949\u201350</center>\n|BSG EHW Thale\n|<center>4\u20130</center>\n|[[FC Rot-Wei\u00df Erfurt|BSG KWU Erfurt]]\n|-\n|<center>''1950\u201351''</center>\n|colspan=3 style=background:#efefef|<center>''No competition held in that season.''</center>\n|-\n|<center>1951\u201352</center>\n|[[Dynamo Dresden|SG Volkspolizei Dresden]]\n|<center>3\u20130</center>\n|[[VfB Einheit zu Pankow|Einheit Pankow]]\n|-\n|<center>[[1952\u201354 FDGB-Pokal|1952\u201354]]</center>\n|[[1.

His novels, especially later ones, incorporate many excerpts from newspapers, magazines and other political sources as a way to enlighten the people about a certain political or social issue. Because of his political opinions he was imprisoned during the 1960s; his imprisonment is featured in his first book, ''That Smell'' (\u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0626\u062d\u0629), which was one of the first writings in [[Egyptian literature]] to adopt a modernist tinge.\n\nIn harmony with his political ideas, in 2003 he refused to accept a prestigious literary award worth 100,000 [[Egyptian pound]]s from Egypt's [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Ministry of Culture]].\n\n==Life==\n\nSonallah Ibrahim was born in [[Cairo]]. His father was an upper-middle class civil servant; his mother, from a poor background, had been a nurse hired to look after his father's paralysed first wife. Ibrahim entered [[Cairo University]] to study law in 1952.<ref name=\"Hassan2003\">Abdalla F. Hassan, [http://www.worldpress.org/Mideast/1205.cfm Black Humor in Dark Times], 19 June 2003.</ref> There he joined the Marxist [[Democratic Movement for National Liberation]] (DMNL). Despite the DMNL's support for [[Nasser]]'s coup, Nasser moved to repress Communists in the late 1950s.<ref name=\"Schatz2013\">Adam Schatz, Black, not Noir [review of Ibrahim, trans. Robyn Creswell, '' 'That Smell' and 'Notes from Prison' ''], ''[[London Review of Books]]'' Vol. 35 No. 5 (7 March 2013), pp.15-16.</ref> Ibrahim, arrested in 1959, received a seven-year prison sentence from a military tribunal.<ref name=\"Hassan2003\"/> He was released in 1964 on the occasion of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] visiting Egypt for the opening of the [[Aswan Dam]].<ref name=\"Schatz2013\"/>\n\n==Writings==\n{{BLP sources section|date=June 2014}}\nHosam Aboul-Ela of the [[University of Houston]] described Ibrahim as \"a relentless internal critic of successive Egyptian regimes\" and wrote that \"Ibrahim might best be described as a sort of Egyptian cross between [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Manuel Puig]]\".<ref name=Aboul-Elap251>Aboul-Ela, p. 251.</ref>\n\nHis novels are typically told in the first person, in a cold objective tone resembling press reportage which mimics reality. His main theme seems to be the importance of resisting the influence of the political mega-powers which attempt to invade the third world economically through many ways including the transcontinental companies. As an example, \"Sharaf\" [=Honour] deals with the intrusion of American politics in Egypt and includes long passages frankly criticising the big drug companies and their policies in third world countries. His interests are not limited to the situation in Egypt; \"Beirut..Beirut\" is something like an overview of the Lebanese civil war of the '70s and '80s, and \"Warda\" reveals a little-known episode about the activities of leftists and communists in Yemen and Oman in the '60s and '70s. The title of one of his latest novels is \"Amricanly\" which superficially means \" American\" or \"in an American way\" but is really a parody of another word \"Othmanly\" related to the notorious Dark Ages when Turkey ruled Egypt. The word \"Amricanly\" in another way is almost a transliteration of the phrase \"My affairs '''''were''''' mine\" in Arabic. His novel, \"The Committee\" is often described by critics as [[kafkaesque]]. In it the protagonist seeks entry into a shadowy organization. He is routinely subject to their vetting process and Sonallah uses his character to make numerous political observations in the form of speeches to the committee.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nSeveral of Ibrahim's works also explore how repetition and fastidious attention to detail can be used to examine the themes of childhood innocence, boredom, and sexual frustration.

His novels, especially later ones, incorporate many excerpts from newspapers, magazines and other political sources as a way to enlighten the people about a certain political or social issue. Because of his political opinions he was imprisoned during the 1960s; his imprisonment is featured in his first book, ''That Smell'' (\u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0626\u062d\u0629), which was one of the first writings in [[Egyptian literature]] to adopt a modernist tinge.\n\nIn harmony with his political ideas, in 2003 he refused to accept a prestigious literary award worth 100,000 [[Egyptian pound]]s from Egypt's [[Ministry of Culture (Egypt)|Ministry of Culture]].\n\n==Life==\n\nSonallah Ibrahim was born in [[Cairo]]. His father was an upper-middle class civil servant; his mother, from a poor background, had been a nurse hired to look after his father's paralysed first wife. Ibrahim entered [[Cairo University]] to study law in 1952.<ref name=\"Hassan2003\">Abdalla F. Hassan, [http://www.worldpress.org/Mideast/1205.cfm Black Humor in Dark Times], 19 June 2003.</ref> There he joined the Marxist [[Democratic Movement for National Liberation]] (DMNL). Despite the DMNL's support for [[Nasser]]'s coup, Nasser moved to repress Communists in the late 1950s.<ref name=\"Schatz2013\">Adam Schatz, Black, not Noir [review of Ibrahim, trans. Robyn Creswell, '' 'That Smell' and 'Notes from Prison' ''], ''[[London Review of Books]]'' Vol. 35 No. 5 (7 March 2013), pp.15-16.</ref> Ibrahim, arrested in 1959, received a seven-year prison sentence from a military tribunal.<ref name=\"Hassan2003\"/> He was released in 1964 on the occasion of [[Nikita Khrushchev]] visiting Egypt for the opening of the [[Aswan Dam]].<ref name=\"Schatz2013\"/>\n\n==Writings==\n{{BLP sources section|date=June 2014}}\nHosam Aboul-Ela of the [[University of Houston]] described Ibrahim as \"a relentless internal critic of successive Egyptian regimes\" and wrote that \"Ibrahim might best be described as a sort of Egyptian cross between [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Manuel Puig]]\".<ref name=Aboul-Elap251>Aboul-Ela, p. 251.</ref>\n\nHis novels are typically told in the first person, in a cold objective tone resembling press reportage which mimics reality. His main theme seems to be the importance of resisting the influence of the political mega-powers which attempt to invade the third world economically through many ways including the transcontinental companies. As an example, \"Sharaf\" [=Honour] deals with the intrusion of American politics in Egypt and includes long passages frankly criticising the big drug companies and their policies in third world countries. His interests are not limited to the situation in Egypt; \"Beirut..Beirut\" is something like an overview of the Lebanese civil war of the '70s and '80s, and \"Warda\" reveals a little-known episode about the activities of leftists and communists in Yemen and Oman in the '60s and '70s. The title of one of his latest novels is \"Amricanly\" which superficially means \" American\" or \"in an American way\" but is really a parody of another word \"Othmanly\" related to the notorious Dark Ages when Turkey ruled Egypt. The word \"Amricanly\" in another way is almost a transliteration of the phrase \"My affairs '''''were''''' mine\" in Arabic. His novel, \"The Committee\" is often described by critics as [[kafkaesque]]. In it the protagonist seeks entry into a shadowy organization. He is routinely subject to their vetting process and Sonallah uses his character to make numerous political observations in the form of speeches to the committee.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\nSeveral of Ibrahim's works also explore how repetition and fastidious attention to detail can be used to examine the themes of childhood innocence, boredom, and sexual frustration. In ''Stealth'', the narrator recounts his childhood memories living with his father in a small, modest apartment. By describing each part of a mundane action, such as hanging up a coat or cooking some eggs, the narrator conveys his childhood curiosity and naivete about the adult world around him. In ''Ice'', extensive repetition of intimate acts, with the same atomistic attention to detail, indicates the narrator's boredom and frustration with life as a foreign student in Soviet Russia.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n==Works==\n\n*''The Smell of It'' (\u062a\u0644\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0627\u0626\u062d\u0629) (1966)\n**Translated by [[Denys Johnson Davies|Denys Johnson-Davies]], 1971; retranslated as ''That Smell & Notes from Prison'', [[Robyn Creswell]], 2013\n**This ''[[roman \u00e0 clef]]'' novella, set during the rule of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], is about a young Egyptian writer who had been a political prisoner is released, and he takes a look at the street life in his country.<ref name=\"Aboul-Elap2512\" />\n*''The Star of August'' (\u0646\u062c\u0645\u0629 \u0623\u063a\u0633\u0637\u0633) (1974)\n*''[[The Committee (novel)|The Committee]]'' (\u0627\u0644\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0629) (1981)\n** Translated by [[Charlene Constable]] and [[Mary St Germain]], 2001, published by [[Syracuse University Press]]<ref name=\"Aboul-Elap2512\" />\n*''Beirut..Beirut'' (\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a \u0628\u064a\u0631\u0648\u062a) (1984)\n**Translated by Chip Rossetti, 2014, published by [[Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Publishing]].\n* ''[[Zaat (novel)|Zaat]]'' (\u0630\u0627\u062a) (1992)\n**Translated by [[Anthony Calderbank]], 2001\n* ''Honor''  (\u0634\u0631\u0641) (1997)\n*''Cairo from Edge to Edge'' (1998)\n**A portrait of Cairo with photographer Jean Pierre Ribiere\n*''Rose''  (\u0648\u0631\u062f\u0629) (2000)\n* ''Amricanly''  (\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u0627\u0646\u0644\u0649) (2003)\n* ''Memoirs from the Oasis Prison'' (\u064a\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0627\u062d\u0627\u062a) (2005)\n* ''Stealth''  (\u0627\u0644\u062a\u0644\u0635\u0635) (2007)\n**Translated by [[Hosam Aboul-Ela]], 2010\n* ''The Turban and the Cap''  (\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0645\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0642\u0628\u0639\u0629) (2008)\n* ''Ice'' (\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0644\u064a\u062f) (2011)\n\n'''As a translator'''\n\n* \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u0648 (The Enemy) by [[James William Drought]]\n\n==Awards==\n*The [[Ibn Rushd Prize for Freedom of Thought]] for the year 2004 in Berlin.\n\n==References==\n* Aboul-Ela, Hosam ([[University of Houston]]). \"Book Reviews.\" ''[[Edebiy\u00e2t]]'', 2003, Vol. 13, No. 2, pp.&nbsp;251\u2013268 (relevant pages: 251-253).

The draft card of 1942 reveals his birth place to be Dzia\u0142y\u0144, but it is unclear, which of the 4 places of this name in Poland it could have been. \n\nAccording to Fairfield's book, he built his first violin already at age 9 in 1895, which would indicate that he came from a luthier or a musical family. In 1903, by the age of 17, he was a trained violin maker.<ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> \n\nAs many Poles of the time would leave the poverty and the Russian and German nationalist oppression of partitioned Poland, he joined his family in the [[United States]]. The year [[1904]], when he would be 17-18 years old, is listed as the year of his immigration in the 1920 New York census, where his name is misspelled William Wikanoski and transcribed as Wikanski. <ref name=\"1920census\">1920 US New York Census, Brooklyn</ref>\n<br>As many Poles would do to assimilate in the United States, it seems he changed his Polish first name to a somewhat similar English name with the same initial, William, which would not be given as a child name in Poland, unless as the German form Wilhelm, known in the German speaking partitions of Poland. One source lists his Polish first name as Wladyslaw.<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> In the New York census records, there are several people listed with the last name Wilkanowski. At least one male relative of Wilkanowski already resided in New York - the father of his cousin Maximilian, born in New York. In [[1905]], William and his wife Amelia had their daughter Helen; several children followed, listed as 7 children, all born in New York and speaking Polish, by the year 1920.<ref name=\"1920census\"></ref>\n\nWilliam worked in the shops of Ditson (Boston) and Fred [[Gretsch]] ([[New York City]]) until he opened his own workshop and store in Brooklyn, New York. He was also a violinist himself and was a member of a polka band in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Cozio Archive\"></ref>\n\n==Career in the United States==\nHe was listed as a violin maker in [[Brooklyn]] by 1933, and at least one violin made in Brooklyn dates to 1924. From 1937 to 1941, he worked in both an era and a location renowned for the [[jazz guitar]]. Gretsch offered Wilkanowski's violins in a 1940 flyer with the text \"his own personal work\u2026no other hand touches them.\" His violins were offered from $50\u2013150.\n\nWilkanowski is thought to have produced 5,000 violins and 100 [[viola]]s by 1942. <ref name=\"Fairfield\"></ref> Some of the higher quality violins were marked with an inlayed logo of the stylized letter ''W''; these instruments are thought to be entirely of his own making, while many of the others were made in the shops with assistants. The Gretsch Company released the Synchromatic line during the early '40s also, which were also [[archtop guitar]]s, but shared no other similarities with Wilkanowski guitars. His role in the Synchromatic is not known.\n\nAlthough known for his violins, Wilkanowski also produced a limited number of archtop guitars.  By 1942 he had sold 30 of these instruments, each unique in appointments and features, at $400 each, except for two deluxe Airway guitars, sold for $600. This price was in line with what was being charged for a D\u2019Angelico New Yorker, or a [[Gibson Guitar Corporation]] Super 400. There is no evidence of guitars made by Wilkanowski after 1943, instead he continued making and successfully selling violins until 1952.\n\n== Features of his guitars ==\nMost of the Wilkanowski guitars would look not like regular jazz guitars, but very much like oversized and slightly squished violins or small cellos with an added guitar neck. Some of his guitars did not have the cello shape, but rather a more conventional archtop shape, without the cello-like points above the waist. The Wilkanowski headstock is thought to have been the main influence in the headstock for the current [[Ovation Guitar]]. Many of his guitars have the unique flattened oval Wilkanowski headstock, although some featured a violin like scroll of aluminium, and some of his headstocks would just be like conventional guitar headstock. The backs of most of his guitars were one piece of flamed [[maple]], with no center joint. The wood William used would often be the Po Valley Poplar, a figured cello tonewood that can resemble maple. The finishing techniques included very light stain, or a violin color finish, and light sealer. The multiple layer binding was wooden, something fairly innovative at the time, and was raised above the level of the top and back plates. The f holes varied by instrument, standard shape, segmented, and later more modern cutouts appeared.  Some of the Instruments displayed the name AIRWAY, some had a W on the headstock, and some remained unbranded. Some of the guitars carry serial numbers, a signature, or a label. Several of the guitars are labeled Wilkanowski and Son, although nothing is known of the son's responsibility. One of these guitars, the Airway W-4 model with abalone shell inlayed rim around the entire body front and abalone ornaments on the neck, was given as a gift to Johnny Cash by his wife June in the 1980s. Johnny kept this guitar until his death, and the instrument was subsequently sold at the [[Johnny Cash]] estate auction by [[Sotheby's]] in 2004, to appear again on auction in 2009.<ref name=\"Cash\"></ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nWilliam married a fellow Pole, Michalina Amelia Glowinska<ref name=\"heritage\"></ref> in New York and together they have raised 7 daughters: Genevieve (1907-1977), Carolyne, Helen, Florence, Irene, Viola and Natalie (1924-2009), and the 2 sons Henry (1922-1965) and Theodore Joseph (1919-1969). His wife would go by her middle name Amelia, sometimes registered as Emilia. In the 1940 New York census, she is listed as Emily and 53 years old, 1 year older than William listed as \"Wm\", 52 years old. Five of their youngest children - the 3 girls and 2 sons - are listed living with the parents in the same 1940 census, which indicates their 4 oldest daughters already moved out and married.<ref name=\"1940census\">1940 US Census, New York, Brooklyn</ref> The name Joseph seems to have been significant to Wilkanowski, who would also label some of his violins with the name \"Juzek\", which is the slightly misspelled Polish diminutive of Joseph. \n\nIn 1942, both of Wilkanowski's sons were drafted for the World War 2 Young Man Draft. In Henry's draft card, there is a detailed description of William as the head (of the house) of the draftee. This 1942 draft card provides the date and place of William's birth, misspelled as the non-existing place \"Dziatyn\" (as the Polish small letter [[\u0142]] looks very much like the Latin [[t]]), his age as 56, his height as 5'4, his weight as 155 pounds, his eye color as brown, hair as gray and complexion as ruddy.
