Since 2000, ''Grandeur of the Seas'' has been deployed in Europe as well as back in the Caribbean homeported in cities such as Tampa, Ft. Lauderdale, and New Orleans. Summers have been spent in Eastern US ports such as Norfolk, Virginia; Baltimore, Maryland and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, visiting the Caribbean, Bermuda and the North East of the US and Canadian Maritimes.\n\n''Grandeur of the Seas'' was based out of Panama in the winter of 2010/2011, replacing her sister ship, ''[[Enchantment of the Seas]]''. In 2013, ''Grandeur of the Seas'' replaced ''Enchantment of the Seas'' out of Baltimore when ''Enchantment of the Seas'' moved to Port Canaveral. {{As of|March 2020}}, the ship offers cruises to Bermuda and the southeast US coast, the Bahamas, and the Southern Caribbean, all departing from [[Baltimore]], Maryland.\n\n==Incidents and accidents==\n===Power loss===\nOn 31 October 2000, ''Grandeur of the Seas'' lost power for 5.5 hours with power to lighting, plumbing and air conditioning restored by 10:45&nbsp;a.m.  The ship was towed to Willemstad, Cura\u00e7ao where repairs were made and got back underway 12 hours late.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-28511708_ITM |title=Royal Caribbean International's ''Grandeur of the Seas'' Docked in Curacao After Power Outage |date=31 October 2000|publisher=Royal Caribbean |accessdate=2 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Dock collision===\nOn 20 April 2005, while docking in Costa Maya, Mexico, a {{convert|42|ft|abbr=on}} long hole was torn in the hull of the ship. The hole was located on deck one of the ship approximately {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the waterline and {{convert|5|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide at its widest. The company said that {{convert|15|kn|abbr=on}} winds and a {{convert|3|kn|km/h|adj=on}} current contributed to the accident. The next seven-day cruise was shortened to five as the ship had to remain in Costa Maya an extra 2 days awaiting materials to patch the hole. Royal Caribbean offered guests transportation back to New Orleans or onboard credit if they chose to stay with the ship. The ship was later dry docked and the damage was repaired.\n\n===Ship-board fire===\nOn 27 May 2013 at 2:50&nbsp;am EDT, a fire broke out on the third deck of ''Grandeur of the Seas''. The fire was extinguished within three hours, and major damage was limited to the aftmost sections of decks 3, 4, and 5. As a precaution, all passengers were required to report to [[muster station|evacuation locations]] for several hours. No evacuation was necessary, and the ship was able to continue under her own power to the Bahamas. The remainder of the cruise was canceled and passengers were flown back to their point of origin from [[Freeport, Bahamas]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Casey Jones |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/05/27/3418918/fire-breaks-out-aboard-royal-caribbean.html |title=Fire breaks out aboard Royal Caribbean cruise ship |date=27 May 2013 | work=The Miami Herald  | accessdate=27 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Capsized lifeboat===\nOn 16 January 2017, a lifeboat fell off of ''Grandeur of the Seas'' while it was docked in Charleston as part of a 10-day Bahamas cruise.

{"title_page": "Scooter (motorcycle)", "text_new": "{{For|similar terms|Scooter (disambiguation)}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Red scooter rider Avenida Do Mar, Funchal, Madeira Island.jpg|upright=1.14|thumb|The [[Vespa]] was the first globally popular scooter ]]\n\nA '''scooter''' or '''motor scooter''' is a type of [[motorcycle]] with a [[step-through frame]] and a platform for the rider's feet. Elements of scooter design were present in some of the earliest motorcycles, and scooters have been made since at least 1914. Scooter development continued in Europe and the United States [[Interwar period|between the World Wars]].\n\nThe global popularity of motor scooters dates from the post-World War II introductions of the [[Vespa]] and [[Lambretta]] models in Italy. These scooters were intended to provide economical personal transportation ([[engine]]s from {{convert|50|to|250|cc|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The original layout is still widely used in this application. Maxi-scooters, with larger engines from {{convert|250|to|850|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} have been developed for Western markets.\n\nScooters are popular for personal transportation partly due to being more affordable, easier to operate, and more convenient to park and store than a car. Licensing requirements for scooters are easier and cheaper than for cars in most parts of the world, and insurance is usually cheaper. The term motor scooter is sometimes used to avoid confusion with [[kick scooter]], but can then be confused with [[motorized scooter]]s, another distinct kind of scooter.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines a motor scooter is a motorcycle similar to a [[kick scooter]] with a seat, a floorboard, and small or low wheels.<ref name=ScooterDefinition/> The [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transportation]] defines a scooter as a motorcycle that has a platform for the operator's feet or has integrated footrests, and has a step-through architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?section=571.123  |title=DOT Regulation Part 571.123: Standard No. 123; Motorcycle controls and displays. |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>\n\nThe classic scooter design features a step-through frame and a flat floorboard for the rider's feet.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} This design is possible because most scooter engines and drive systems are attached to the rear axle or under the seat. Unlike a conventional motorcycle, in which the engine is mounted on the frame, most modern scooters allow the engine to swing with the rear wheel, while most vintage scooters and some newer [[retro]] models have an axle-mounted engine. Modern scooters starting from late-1980s generally use a [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT), while older ones use a manual transmission with the gearshift and clutch control built into the left handlebar.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nScooters usually feature bodywork, including a front leg shield and body that conceals all or most of the mechanicals. There is often some integral storage space, either under the seat, built into the front leg shield, or both. Scooters have varying engine displacements and configurations ranging from 50&nbsp;cc single-cylinder to 850&nbsp;cc twin-cylinder models.\n\nTraditionally, scooter wheels are smaller than conventional motorcycle wheels and are made of pressed steel or cast aluminum alloy, bolt on easily, and often are interchangeable between front and rear. Some scooters carry a [[spare wheel]]. Many recent scooters use conventional [[Motorcycle fork|front forks]] with the front axle fastened at both ends.\n\n== Regulatory classification ==\n\nMost jurisdictions do not differentiate between scooters and motorcycles. For all legal purposes in the United States of America, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) recommends using the term motorcycle for all of these vehicles. However, while NHTSA excludes the term ''motor scooter'' from legal definition, it proceeds, in the same document, to give detailed instructions on how to import a small motor scooter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import/FAQ%20Site/pages/page3.html#Anchor-52644   |title=Importation and Certification FAQ's Directory-Motorcycles and Scooters |publisher=Nhtsa.dot.gov   |accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref>\n\n===California===\n{{As of|2020}} the US state of California has a highly complex regulatory system for 2- and 3-wheeled vehicles.  It classifies vehicles with fewer than four wheels into the following categories:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myronsmopeds.com/category/california-vehicle-codes/|title=California Vehicle Codes|work=Myron's Mopeds}}</ref>\n* Motorcycle: a motorcycle is any 2- or 3-wheeled gas operated vehicle weighing under 1,500 lbs. with an engine displacement greater than or equal to 150ccs.  Operation requires an M1 class license, and such vehicles must be registered with the state and carry mandatory insurance as well as bear a motorcycle license plate.  Motorcycles may travel on any public roadway, including freeways, and may carry a single passenger in addition to the driver.  Helmets are mandatory.\n* Motor-driven cycle: a motor-driven cycle is 2-wheeled gas operated vehicle with an engine displacement of 149ccs or less that does not qualify as a moped (see below) and is capable of traveling greater than 30mph.  It has the same licensing, registration, insurance, license plating, and helmet requirements as a motorcycle, though it may not travel on freewways.  Such vehicles are commonly referred to as \"scooters\".\n* Moped: a moped (or \"motorized bicycle\") is a 2- or 3-wheeled device with an automatic transmission capable of traveling no more than 30mph, with either a gas engine displacement of less than 50ccs (i.e., 49ccs or less) ''with'' built-in pedals like a bicycle for human operation, OR, if powered only by electricity, it must not produce more than four gross [[brake horsepower]] (bicycle pedals are optional for electric mopeds).  There are no registration or insurance requirements for the device, but the operator him- or herself must have an M1 or M2 class license and must personally carry the minimum state automobile insurance and the moped itself must bear a special moped license plate. A single passenger is permitted if the vehicle is fitted with a specific seat and footrests for same.\n*Motorized tricycle/ quadricycie: a motorized tricycle or quadricycle is a 3- or 4-wheeled vehicle propelled by a gas motor not capable of traveling greater than 30mph and with a gross brake horsepower of 2 or less.\n* Motorized scooter: a motorized scooter is a 2-wheeled vehicle not capable of traveling greater than 15mph with a floorboard designed to be stood upon while operating.  They do not require a license plate or insurance, and may not be driven on a roadway with a posted speed limit greater than 25mph.  A valid class C driver license is required, as is a bicycle helmet.  Passenger are prohibited.  They may be operated on a bikepath or bikeway but not on a sidewalk.  If a given roadway has a bicycle lane, the motorized scooter must travel within it, and can only make a left-hand turn by dismounting and crossing an intersection as a pedestrian.\n* Electric bicycle: California recognizes three classes of electric bicycle.  A class 1 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose electric motor only provides assistance to the rider when using the pedals and stops assisting when the bicycle reaches 20mph; a class 2 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose motor can drive the bicycle entirely on its own, but will not assist the rider above 20mph; a class 3 electric bicycle is identical to a class 1 electric bicycle, but is capable of traveling up 28mph before the engine stops assisting the rider AND is equipped with a speedometer.  No electric bicycle requires insurance, a license, or any form of registration or license plate as it is not considered a \"motor vehicle\" by the state.\n\n== Emissions ==\n{{See also|Fuel gas-powered scooter}}\nThe [[vehicle emissions control|emissions]] of [[moped]]s and scooters have been the subject of multiple studies.

D'Ascanio's {{convert|98|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} scooter had various new design concepts, including a stress-bearing structure. The [[gear shift]] lever was moved to the handlebars for easier riding. The engine was placed near the rear wheel, eliminating the [[belt drive]]. The typical fork support was replaced by an arm similar to an aircraft carriage for easier tire-changing. The body design protected the driver from wind and road dirt. The smaller wheels and shorter wheelbase provide improved maneuverability through narrow streets and congested traffic.

Honda's [[Honda PS250|PS250]] (also known as Big Ruckus) features a motorcycle-like exoskeleton instead of bodywork.\n\nA new direction in maxi-scooters has the engine fixed to the frame. This arrangement improves handling by allowing bigger wheels and less unsprung weight, also tending to move the centre of gravity forwards. The trend toward larger, more powerful scooters with fully automatic transmissions converges with an emerging trend in motorcycle design that foreshadows automatic transmission motorcycles with on-board storage.

This has a slanted downtube, which defines an underbone, and no foot platform, the presence of which defines a scooter.]]\n\nAn [[underbone]] is a motorcycle built on a chassis consisting mostly of a single large diameter tube. An underbone differs from a conventional motorcycle mainly by not having a structural member connecting the [[head stock]] to the structure under the front of the seat and by not having a fuel tank or similarly styled appendage in the space between the riders knees. Underbones are commonly referred to as \"step-throughs\" and appeal to both genders in much the same way as scooters.\n\nUnderbones are often mistaken for scooters and are sometimes marketed as such. However, an underbone does not have a footboard, and is therefore not a scooter.\n\nThe engine of an underbone is usually fixed to the chassis under the downtube, while a scooter usually has its engine mounted on its [[swingarm]]. As a result, underbone engines are usually further forwards than those of scooters. A typical underbone therefore has a more central [[center of mass|centre of gravity]] than a typical scooter. Furthermore, having an engine mounted on the swingarm gives a typical scooter more [[unsprung mass]] than a typical underbone. These factors give a typical underbone better handling than a typical scooter.\n\nThe engine of an underbone typically drives the rear wheel by a chain of the kind used on a conventional motorcycle. This final drive is often concealed by a chain enclosure to keep the chain clean and reduce wear. The final drive of a scooter with a swingarm-mounted engine runs in a sealed oil bath and is shorter.\n\nAn underbone is usually fitted with near full-size motorcycle wheels, which are often spoked. Scooter wheels are usually small, and made from pressed steel. In both cases, more recent examples often have cast alloy wheels. The bigger wheels of an underbone allow more ventilation and better cooling for the brakes than the smaller wheels of a scooter.\n\nWhile the engine and suspension layouts described here for scooters and underbones are typical, they are not rigid definitions. There have been scooters with fixed engines and chain drive, and there have been underbones with swingarm-mounted engines. A twenty-first century example of variance from the typical scooter layout is the [[Suzuki Choinori]], which had both its engine and its rear axle rigidly bolted to its frame.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Some atypical scooters and underbones\">\nFile:Heinkel Tourist 103 A0, Bj. 1956.jpg|1956 Heinkel Tourist.

In Thailand, scooters are used for street to door taxi services, as well as for navigating through heavy traffic. The extensive range of cycle tracks in the Netherlands extends into parts of Belgium and Germany and is open to all small powered two-wheelers. Motor scooters are popular because of their size, [[fuel efficiency|fuel-efficiency]], weight, and typically larger storage room than a motorcycle.

Scooters had provided inexpensive transportation for decades before the development of the mod subculture, but the mods stood out in the way that they treated the vehicle as a fashion accessory, expressed through clubs such as the [[Ace of Herts]]. Italian scooters were preferred for their cleanlined, curving shapes and gleaming [[chrome plating|chrome]]. For young mods, Italian scooters were the \"embodiment of continental style and a way to escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing\".<ref name=\"straight.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/article/vespa-scoots-sexily-back-to-vancouver|title=Vespa Scoots Sexily Back to Vancouver|last=Sarti|first=Doug|date=June 3, 2004|publisher=Vancouver Free Press|location=Vancouver, Canada|quote=The scooter, to them, was the embodiment of continental style and a way to escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing.|work=straight.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522112423/http://www.straight.com/article/vespa-scoots-sexily-back-to-vancouver|archivedate=2011-05-22|url-status=live|accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref> They customized their scooters by painting them in \"two-tone and candyflake and overaccessorized [them] with luggage racks, crash bars, and scores of mirrors and fog lights\",<ref name=\"straight.com\"/> and they often put their names on the small windscreen. Engine side panels and front bumpers were taken to local electroplating workshops and plated with highly reflective chrome.\n\nScooters were also a practical and accessible form of transportation for 1960s teens. In the early 1960s, [[public transport]] stopped relatively early in the night, and so having scooters allowed mods to stay out all night at dance clubs. To keep their expensive suits clean and keep warm while riding, mods often wore long army parkas. For teens with low-end jobs, scooters were cheaper than cars, and they could be bought on a payment plan through newly available [[hire purchase]] plans. After a law was passed requiring at least one mirror be attached to every motorcycle, mods were known to add four, ten, or as many as 30 mirrors to their scooters. The cover of [[The Who]]'s album ''[[Quadrophenia]]'', which includes themes related to mods and [[Rocker (subculture)|rockers]], depicts a young man on a Vespa GS with four mirrors attached.<ref>{{cite book|last=Townsend|first=Pete|title=Quadrophenia|year=1973|publisher=Fabulous Music Ltd., 1973|location=London|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7r3PSgAACAAJ&dq=quadrophenia}}</ref> The album spawned a [[Quadrophenia (film)|1979 motion picture of the same name]].\n\n[[Scooterboy]] magazines include the British monthly magazine ''[[Scootering (British magazine)|Scootering]]''<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gillard|first1=Andy|first2=Gareth |last2=Brown |author3=Stuart Lanning |title=Scootering |journal=Scootering |year=1986 |url=http://www.mortonsmediagroup.com/media/sco.asp#ratecardia}}</ref> \nand the American quarterly magazine ''Scoot!''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Whitney |first1=April |first2=Josh |last2=Rogers |first3=Mike |last3=Zorn |first4=Casey |last4=Earls |first5=Barry |last5=Synoground |journal=Scoot! |year=1995|url=http://www.scootmagazine.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517035608/http://www.scootmagazine.com/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2008-05-17 |title= Scoot!}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Auto rickshaw]]\n* [[Cutdown]]\n* [[List of scooter manufacturers]]\n* [[List of scooters]]\n* [[Fuel gas-powered scooter#Conversion kits for petrol scooters|Fuel conversion kits for scooters]]\n* [[Mobility scooter]]\n* [[Segway PT]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{-}}\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=ScooterDefinition>Various scooter definitions:\n* {{cite book |title= The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary |edition= third |year= 1968 |origyear= 1956 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford, UK |pages= 1808\u201309|quote='''3.'''

Elements of scooter design were present in some of the earliest motorcycles, and scooters have been made since at least 1914. Scooter development continued in Europe and the United States [[Interwar period|between the World Wars]].\n\nThe global popularity of motor scooters dates from the post-World War II introductions of the [[Vespa]] and [[Lambretta]] models in Italy. These scooters were intended to provide economical personal transportation ([[engine]]s from {{convert|50|to|250|cc|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The original layout is still widely used in this application. Maxi-scooters, with larger engines from {{convert|250|to|850|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} have been developed for Western markets.\n\nScooters are popular for personal transportation partly due to being more affordable, easier to operate, and more convenient to park and store than a car. Licensing requirements for scooters are easier and cheaper than for cars in most parts of the world, and insurance is usually cheaper. The term motor scooter is sometimes used to avoid confusion with [[kick scooter]], but can then be confused with [[motorized scooter]]s, another distinct kind of scooter.\n\n== Description ==\nThe Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines a motor scooter is a motorcycle similar to a [[kick scooter]] with a seat, a floorboard, and small or low wheels.<ref name=ScooterDefinition/> The [[United States Department of Transportation|US Department of Transportation]] defines a scooter as a motorcycle that has a platform for the operator's feet or has integrated footrests, and has a step-through architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/rules-regulations/administration/fmcsr/fmcsrruletext.asp?section=571.123  |title=DOT Regulation Part 571.123: Standard No. 123; Motorcycle controls and displays. |publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration |accessdate=2010-06-03}}</ref>\n\nThe classic scooter design features a step-through frame and a flat floorboard for the rider's feet.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} This design is possible because most scooter engines and drive systems are attached to the rear axle or under the seat. Unlike a conventional motorcycle, in which the engine is mounted on the frame, most modern scooters allow the engine to swing with the rear wheel, while most vintage scooters and some newer [[retro]] models have an axle-mounted engine. Modern scooters starting from late-1980s generally use a [[continuously variable transmission]] (CVT), while older ones use a manual transmission with the gearshift and clutch control built into the left handlebar.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nScooters usually feature bodywork, including a front leg shield and body that conceals all or most of the mechanicals. There is often some integral storage space, either under the seat, built into the front leg shield, or both. Scooters have varying engine displacements and configurations ranging from 50&nbsp;cc single-cylinder to 850&nbsp;cc twin-cylinder models.\n\nTraditionally, scooter wheels are smaller than conventional motorcycle wheels and are made of pressed steel or cast aluminum alloy, bolt on easily, and often are interchangeable between front and rear. Some scooters carry a [[spare wheel]]. Many recent scooters use conventional [[Motorcycle fork|front forks]] with the front axle fastened at both ends.\n\n== Regulatory classification ==\n\nMost jurisdictions do not differentiate between scooters and motorcycles. For all legal purposes in the United States of America, the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) recommends using the term motorcycle for all of these vehicles. However, while NHTSA excludes the term ''motor scooter'' from legal definition, it proceeds, in the same document, to give detailed instructions on how to import a small motor scooter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/rules/import/FAQ%20Site/pages/page3.html#Anchor-52644   |title=Importation and Certification FAQ's Directory-Motorcycles and Scooters |publisher=Nhtsa.dot.gov   |accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref>\n\n===California===\n{{As of|2020}} the US state of California has a highly complex regulatory system for 2- and 3-wheeled vehicles.  It classifies vehicles with fewer than four wheels into the following categories:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myronsmopeds.com/category/california-vehicle-codes/|title=California Vehicle Codes|work=Myron's Mopeds}}</ref>\n* Motorcycle: a motorcycle is any 2- or 3-wheeled gas operated vehicle weighing under 1,500 lbs. with an engine displacement greater than or equal to 150ccs.  Operation requires an M1 class license, and such vehicles must be registered with the state and carry mandatory insurance as well as bear a motorcycle license plate.  Motorcycles may travel on any public roadway, including freeways, and may carry a single passenger in addition to the driver.  Helmets are mandatory.\n* Motor-driven cycle: a motor-driven cycle is 2-wheeled gas operated vehicle with an engine displacement of 149ccs or less that does not qualify as a moped (see below) and is capable of traveling greater than 30mph.  It has the same licensing, registration, insurance, license plating, and helmet requirements as a motorcycle, though it may not travel on freewways.  Such vehicles are commonly referred to as \"scooters\".\n* Moped: a moped (or \"motorized bicycle\") is a 2- or 3-wheeled device with an automatic transmission capable of traveling no more than 30mph, with either a gas engine displacement of less than 50ccs (i.e., 49ccs or less) ''with'' built-in pedals like a bicycle for human operation, OR, if powered only by electricity, it must not produce more than four gross [[brake horsepower]] (bicycle pedals are optional for electric mopeds).  There are no registration or insurance requirements for the device, but the operator him- or herself must have an M1 or M2 class license and must personally carry the minimum state automobile insurance and the moped itself must bear a special moped license plate. A single passenger is permitted if the vehicle is fitted with a specific seat and footrests for same.\n*Motorized tricycle/ quadricycie: a motorized tricycle or quadricycle is a 3- or 4-wheeled vehicle propelled by a gas motor not capable of traveling greater than 30mph and with a gross brake horsepower of 2 or less.\n* Motorized scooter: a motorized scooter is a 2-wheeled vehicle not capable of traveling greater than 15mph with a floorboard designed to be stood upon while operating.  They do not require a license plate or insurance, and may not be driven on a roadway with a posted speed limit greater than 25mph.  A valid class C driver license is required, as is a bicycle helmet.  Passenger are prohibited.  They may be operated on a bikepath or bikeway but not on a sidewalk.  If a given roadway has a bicycle lane, the motorized scooter must travel within it, and can only make a left-hand turn by dismounting and crossing an intersection as a pedestrian.\n* Electric bicycle: California recognizes three classes of electric bicycle.  A class 1 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose electric motor only provides assistance to the rider when using the pedals and stops assisting when the bicycle reaches 20mph; a class 2 electric bicycle is a bicycle with pedals whose motor can drive the bicycle entirely on its own, but will not assist the rider above 20mph; a class 3 electric bicycle is identical to a class 1 electric bicycle, but is capable of traveling up 28mph before the engine stops assisting the rider AND is equipped with a speedometer.  No electric bicycle requires insurance, a license, or any form of registration or license plate as it is not considered a \"motor vehicle\" by the state.\n\n== Emissions ==\n{{See also|Fuel gas-powered scooter}}\nThe [[vehicle emissions control|emissions]] of [[moped]]s and scooters have been the subject of multiple studies. Studies have found that [[two-stroke engine|two-stroke]] 50&nbsp;[[Cubic centimetre|cc]] mopeds, with and without catalytic converters, emit ten to thirty times more hydrocarbons and particulate emissions than the outdated [[European emission standards|Euro 3]] automobile standards.<ref name=\"eri.ucr.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eri.ucr.edu/ISAFXVCD/ISAFXVAF/EmMPFAM.pdf|work=Schramm et al.|title=Emissions from a Moped Fuelled by Gasoline/Ethanol Mixtures|accessdate=2010-07-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=44|issue=1|pages=505\u2013512|title=Chemical characterization of emissions from modern two-stroke mopeds complying with legislative regulation in Europe (EURO-2)|doi=10.1021/es9021969|pmid=19928903|year = 2010|last1 = Adam|first1 = T.|last2=Farfaletti|first2=A.|last3=Montero|first3=L.|last4=Martini|first4=G.|last5=Manfredi|first5=U.|last6=Larsen|first6=B.|last7=Santi|first7=G.

It was water-cooled and had a [[radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] built into the top of the rear fender. It became the first mass-produced and publicly sold powered two-wheel vehicle, and among the first powered mainly by its engine rather than foot pedals. Maximum speed was {{convert|40|kph|abbr=on}}. The rear wheel was driven directly by rods from the pistons in a manner similar to the drive wheels of [[steam locomotive]]s. Only a few hundred such bikes were built, and the high price and technical difficulties made the venture a financial failure for both Wolfm\u00fcller and his financial backer, Hildebrand.<ref name=\"WoM_HuW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.khulsey.com/motorcycles/vintage_motorcycle_hildebrand_wolfmueller.html|title=The World of Motorcycles: Vintage Motorcycles - Hildebrand & Wolfm\u00fcller|publisher=Kevin Hulsey Illustration, Inc.|website=theworldofmotorcycles.com|accessdate=2009-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn France, the [[Auto-Fauteuil]] was introduced in 1902.

The body design protected the driver from wind and road dirt. The smaller wheels and shorter wheelbase provide improved maneuverability through narrow streets and congested traffic.

Honda's [[Honda PS250|PS250]] (also known as Big Ruckus) features a motorcycle-like exoskeleton instead of bodywork.\n\nA new direction in maxi-scooters has the engine fixed to the frame. This arrangement improves handling by allowing bigger wheels and less unsprung weight, also tending to move the centre of gravity forwards. The trend toward larger, more powerful scooters with fully automatic transmissions converges with an emerging trend in motorcycle design that foreshadows automatic transmission motorcycles with on-board storage. Examples include the [[Aprilia Mana 850]] automatic-transmission motorcycle and the [[Honda NC700D Integra]], which is a scooter built on a motorcycle platform.\n\n===Enclosed scooter===\n{{Main|Cabin motorcycle}}\n\nSome scooters, including the [[BMW C1]] and the [[Honda Gyro|Honda Gyro Canopy]], have a windscreen and a roof.

Some examples are: the [[ENV]] from Intelligent Energy, [[Honda]]'s scooter using the Honda FC Stack, and the Yamaha FC-AQEL. Also, petroleum hybrid-electric motorcycles are available.

Battery technology is gradually improving making this form of transportation more practical.<ref>[http://www.technologyreview.com/NanoTech/17837/ Technology Review: Making Electric Vehicles Practical<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Underbone==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n{{Main|Underbone}}\n[[File:Kymco Activ.JPG|thumb|Kymco Activ underbone. This has a slanted downtube, which defines an underbone, and no foot platform, the presence of which defines a scooter.]]\n\nAn [[underbone]] is a motorcycle built on a chassis consisting mostly of a single large diameter tube. An underbone differs from a conventional motorcycle mainly by not having a structural member connecting the [[head stock]] to the structure under the front of the seat and by not having a fuel tank or similarly styled appendage in the space between the riders knees. Underbones are commonly referred to as \"step-throughs\" and appeal to both genders in much the same way as scooters.\n\nUnderbones are often mistaken for scooters and are sometimes marketed as such. However, an underbone does not have a footboard, and is therefore not a scooter.\n\nThe engine of an underbone is usually fixed to the chassis under the downtube, while a scooter usually has its engine mounted on its [[swingarm]]. As a result, underbone engines are usually further forwards than those of scooters. A typical underbone therefore has a more central [[center of mass|centre of gravity]] than a typical scooter. Furthermore, having an engine mounted on the swingarm gives a typical scooter more [[unsprung mass]] than a typical underbone. These factors give a typical underbone better handling than a typical scooter.\n\nThe engine of an underbone typically drives the rear wheel by a chain of the kind used on a conventional motorcycle. This final drive is often concealed by a chain enclosure to keep the chain clean and reduce wear. The final drive of a scooter with a swingarm-mounted engine runs in a sealed oil bath and is shorter.\n\nAn underbone is usually fitted with near full-size motorcycle wheels, which are often spoked. Scooter wheels are usually small, and made from pressed steel. In both cases, more recent examples often have cast alloy wheels. The bigger wheels of an underbone allow more ventilation and better cooling for the brakes than the smaller wheels of a scooter.\n\nWhile the engine and suspension layouts described here for scooters and underbones are typical, they are not rigid definitions. There have been scooters with fixed engines and chain drive, and there have been underbones with swingarm-mounted engines. A twenty-first century example of variance from the typical scooter layout is the [[Suzuki Choinori]], which had both its engine and its rear axle rigidly bolted to its frame.\n\n<gallery caption=\"Some atypical scooters and underbones\">\nFile:Heinkel Tourist 103 A0, Bj. 1956.jpg|1956 Heinkel Tourist.

In Thailand, scooters are used for street to door taxi services, as well as for navigating through heavy traffic. The extensive range of cycle tracks in the Netherlands extends into parts of Belgium and Germany and is open to all small powered two-wheelers. Motor scooters are popular because of their size, [[fuel efficiency|fuel-efficiency]], weight, and typically larger storage room than a motorcycle. In many localities, certain road motor scooters are considered by law to be in the same class as mopeds or small motorcycles and therefore they have fewer restrictions than do larger motorcycles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nAccording to the [[Motorcycle Industry Council]], sales of motor scooters in the United States have more than doubled since 2000.

Scooters had provided inexpensive transportation for decades before the development of the mod subculture, but the mods stood out in the way that they treated the vehicle as a fashion accessory, expressed through clubs such as the [[Ace of Herts]]. Italian scooters were preferred for their cleanlined, curving shapes and gleaming [[chrome plating|chrome]]. For young mods, Italian scooters were the \"embodiment of continental style and a way to escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing\".<ref name=\"straight.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.straight.com/article/vespa-scoots-sexily-back-to-vancouver|title=Vespa Scoots Sexily Back to Vancouver|last=Sarti|first=Doug|date=June 3, 2004|publisher=Vancouver Free Press|location=Vancouver, Canada|quote=The scooter, to them, was the embodiment of continental style and a way to escape the working-class row houses of their upbringing.|work=straight.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522112423/http://www.straight.com/article/vespa-scoots-sexily-back-to-vancouver|archivedate=2011-05-22|url-status=live|accessdate=2012-05-06}}</ref> They customized their scooters by painting them in \"two-tone and candyflake and overaccessorized [them] with luggage racks, crash bars, and scores of mirrors and fog lights\",<ref name=\"straight.com\"/> and they often put their names on the small windscreen. Engine side panels and front bumpers were taken to local electroplating workshops and plated with highly reflective chrome.\n\nScooters were also a practical and accessible form of transportation for 1960s teens. In the early 1960s, [[public transport]] stopped relatively early in the night, and so having scooters allowed mods to stay out all night at dance clubs. To keep their expensive suits clean and keep warm while riding, mods often wore long army parkas. For teens with low-end jobs, scooters were cheaper than cars, and they could be bought on a payment plan through newly available [[hire purchase]] plans. After a law was passed requiring at least one mirror be attached to every motorcycle, mods were known to add four, ten, or as many as 30 mirrors to their scooters.

With the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]] approaching, Eisenhower was forced to rescind the offer.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=161\u2013164}}\n\nThe October 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] brought relations between Britain and the United States to a low ebb.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=171\u2013174}} When Eisenhower met with the new Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], in Bermuda in March 1957, he raised the possibility of basing US [[intermediate range ballistic missile]] (IRBM) systems in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=174\u2013177}} This came to be called [[Project Emily]].{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=98\u201399}} There were also discussions on exchanging nuclear submarine propulsion technology for information on the British [[Calder Hall]] [[nuclear power plant]], allowing the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) to purchase uranium ore from Canada, and co-ordinating the war plans of [[RAF Bomber Command]] with those of the [[Strategic Air Command]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nAlthough the IRBM negotiations pre-dated the Suez Crisis, it suited the British government to tout the IRBM deal as a demonstration that the rift had been healed.{{sfn|Young|2007|p=8}} The [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] attempted to detonate a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test series at [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] in the Pacific.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}} The test series was facilitated by the United States, which also claimed the island.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=159\u2013160}} Although the first tests were unsuccessful,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=147}} the Grapple X test on 8 November achieved the desired result.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}}{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=160\u2013162}}\n===Sputnik crisis===\n[[File:HD.3C.001 (13406014683).jpg|thumb|right|Eisenhower (left) lays the cornerstone for the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) building in [[Germantown, Maryland]], on 8 November 1957.

Durham]] (centre) and AEC Chairman [[Lewis Strauss]] (right) look on.]]\nThe successful development of British thermonuclear weapons came at an opportune time to renew negotiations with the United States. The Soviet Union's launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the world's first [[artificial satellite]], on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend their relationship.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} At the suggestion of [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia|Harold Caccia]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador to the United States]], Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=199}} as Macmillan put it, to meet the Soviet challenge on every front, \"military, economic and political\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v27/d306 |access-date=12 September 2017 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1955\u20131957, Western Europe and Canada, Volume XXVII \u2013 Document 306  |publisher=Office of the Historian, United States Department of State }}</ref>\n\nMacmillan flew to Washington, DC, for talks on 25 October.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} He had concerns that the disastrous 10 October [[Windscale fire]] might prove a stumbling block in negotiations,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} as it might reflect badly on British expertise and provide ammunition for opponents of closer co-operation with the UK. He ordered extra copies of the report into the fire to be destroyed, and for the printers to destroy their [[Letterpress printing|type]].<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Britain Suppressed Details of '57 Atomic Disaster: Macmillan feared the loss of U.S. cooperation |first=Steve |last=Lohr |date=2 January 1988 |p=3 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/02/world/britain-suppressed-details-of-57-atomic-disaster.html |access-date=18 August 2019 }}</ref> He immediately sensed how shaken the Americans had been by Sputnik.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} It placed the Eisenhower administration under great public pressure to act on the deployment of IRBMs by a shocked and distraught nation.{{sfn|Divine|1993|pp=73\u201374}}\n\nEisenhower and Macmillan agreed to form a study group headed by Sir Richard Powell, the Permanent Secretary to the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], and [[Donald A. Quarles]], the [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]], to consider how the deployment of IRBMs to Britain might be expedited.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} Another study group, under Strauss and Sir [[Edwin Plowden, Baron Plowden|Edwin Plowden]], the head of the UKAEA, would investigate nuclear co-operation and the exchange of nuclear information.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} The personal relationship developed between Plowden and Strauss would be crucial in converting the latter over to the idea of providing information to Britain.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}}\n\nBy December, most of the issues with the IRBM negotiations had been ironed out,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=442}} and a formal agreement was drawn up on 17 December, although it was not until the end of the month that it was definitely determined that Britain would receive [[PGM-17 Thor|Thor]] and not [[PGM-19|Jupiter]] missiles.{{sfn|Wynn|1997|p=287}} However, the nuclear submarine propulsion effort was running into trouble. Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed. They wanted to know the weight and dimensions, fusing and firing sequences, safety features, and in-flight procedures; the information that would allow American bombs to be carried in British [[V-bombers]], and American warheads to be fitted to British [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]] missiles.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} This would potentially save millions of pounds and avoid domestic political complications if Britain had to persist with nuclear testing during an international moratorium.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=440}} While the British knew what they wanted, there was no consensus among the Americans as to what they wanted to provide.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} The [[United States Secretary of State]], [[John Foster Dulles]], was concerned that a special relationship with Britain might complicate the United States' relationships with its other allies.{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=439}} Strauss in particular felt that a proposal to give hydrogen bomb secrets to the British would likely not get past the JCAE, and counselled drafting amendments that were sufficiently vague as to give the president the authority he needed without arousing its ire.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}} Eisenhower declared that the US and UK were \"interdependent\", and pledged to ask Congress to amend the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=33}}\n\nCrucially, he managed to secure the support of [[Carl T. Durham]], the chairman of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton P. Anderson]] failed to attract much support.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} On 27 January 1958, Strauss sent Durham the administration's proposed legislative changes,{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} and the JCAE Subcommittee on Agreements for Cooperation, chaired by Senator [[John O. Pastore]], held hearings from 29 to 31 January. Quarles and [[Major General (United States)|Major General]] [[Herbert Loper]], the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Atomic Energy Affairs, were forced to deal with pointed questions about [[nuclear proliferation]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=215\u2013219}} British information security, or the lack thereof, no longer seemed so important now that the Soviet Union was apparently ahead, and the United Kingdom had independently developed the hydrogen bomb,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=224\u2013225}} but the JCAE objected to the terms of the proposed deal to trade British uranium-235 for American [[plutonium]], under which the US would pay [[United States dollar|USD]] $30 per gram for plutonium that cost USD $12 per gram to produce in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=224}}\n\nThe amendments were passed by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on 19 June, but not without changes. It now limited exchanges of nuclear weapons data to nations that had made substantial progress in the field. The same restriction applied to the actual transfer of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons. American nuclear weapons were to remain under US custody and could only be turned over to allies in the event of war. The sale of nuclear reactors for submarines and nuclear fuel for them and other military reactors was permitted. Only Britain qualified as a nation that had made substantial progress.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=232\u2013233}} The bill passed Congress on 30 June 1958, and was signed into law by Eisenhower on 2 July 1958.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=234\u2013236}} The 1958 US\u2013UK Mutual Defence Agreement was signed by Dulles and [[Samuel Hood, 6th Viscount Hood|Samuel Hood]], the British Minister in Washington, DC, on 3 July,<ref name=\"full text\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nti.org/media/pdfs/56_4.pdf |title=Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defence Purposes |publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative |access-date=1 June 2017 }}</ref> and approved by Congress on 30 July.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=238}}\n\n==Implementation==\n===Details of the agreement===\n[[File:Defense.gov photo essay 080709-D-7203C-008.jpg|thumb|left|UK Defence Minister [[Des Browne]] (right) addresses a reception hosted by US Defense Secretary [[Robert M.

The US delegation included [[Willard Libby]], AEC deputy chairman; Loper; [[Brigadier General (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Alfred Starbird]], AEC Director of Military Applications; [[Norris Bradbury]], director of the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]; [[Edward Teller]], director of the [[Lawrence Livermore Laboratory]]; and [[James W.

The British representatives were Sir [[Frederick Brundrett]], the [[Chief Scientific Adviser to the Ministry of Defence]], and Victor Macklen from the Ministry of Defence; and [[William Penney]], [[William Richard Joseph Cook|William Cook]] and E. F. Newly from the [[Atomic Weapons Research Establishment]] at [[Aldermaston]]. The Americans disclosed the details of nine of their nuclear weapon designs: the [[Mark 7 nuclear bomb|Mark 7]], [[Mark 15 nuclear bomb|Mark 15]]/[[Mark 39 nuclear bomb|39]], [[W19 (nuclear artillery shell)|Mark 19]], [[W25 (nuclear warhead)|Mark 25]], [[Mark 27 nuclear bomb|Mark 27]], [[B28 nuclear bomb|Mark 28]], [[W31|Mark 31]], [[W33 (nuclear warhead)|Mark 33]] and [[W34 (nuclear warhead)|Mark 34]]. In return, the British provided the details of seven of theirs, including [[Yellow Sun (nuclear weapon)#Green Grass|Green Grass]]; Pennant, the boosted device which had been detonated in the Grapple Z test on 22 August; Flagpole, the two-stage device scheduled for 2 September; Burgee, scheduled for 23 September; and the three-stage Halliard 3. The Americans were impressed with the British designs, particularly with Halliard 1, the heavier version of Halliard 3. Cook therefore changed the Grapple Z programme to fire Halliard 1 instead of Halliard 3.{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=202\u2013205}} Macmillan noted in his diary, with satisfaction that:{{quote|in some respects we are as far, and even further, advanced in the art than our American friends.

Under the treaty, the US supplied the UK with not just nuclear submarine propulsion technology, but a complete [[S5W]] [[pressurised water reactor]] of the kind used to power the US {{sclass-|Skipjack|submarine|0}} submarines. This was used in the Royal Navy's first nuclear-powered submarine, {{HMS|Dreadnought|S101|6}}, which was [[ceremonial ship launching|launched]] in 1960 and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] in 1963. The S5W was fuelled by uranium enriched to between 93 and 97 per cent [[uranium-235]].{{sfn|Ritchie|2015|p=3}} Reactor technology was transferred from Westinghouse to [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]],{{sfn|Moore|2010|p=35}} which used it as the basis for its [[PWR1]] reactor used in the UK's  {{sclass-|Valiant|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Resolution|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Churchill|submarine|5}}, {{sclass-|Swiftsure|submarine|5}} and {{sclass-|Trafalgar|submarine|5}} submarines.{{sfn|Ritchie|2015|p=4}}\n\nThe UK produced HEU at its facility in [[Capenhurst]], but production for military purposes ceased there in March 1963.{{sfn|Moore|2010|pp=197\u2013199}} Thereafter, uranium oxide was imported from Australia, Canada, Namibia, South Africa, the United States and Zaire, and processed into [[uranium hexafluoride]] at Springfields.

The treaty's full name is '''Agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for Cooperation on the uses of Atomic Energy for Mutual Defense Purposes'''. It allows the United States and the UK to exchange nuclear materials, technology and information. While the US has [[nuclear sharing|nuclear co-operation]] agreements with other countries, including France and other [[NATO]] countries, this agreement is by far the most comprehensive. Because of the agreement's strategic value to Britain, [[Harold Macmillan]] (the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] who presided over the United Kingdom's entry into the agreement) called it \"the Great Prize\".{{sfn|Macmillan|1971|p=323}}\n\nThe treaty was signed on 3 July 1958, after the [[Soviet Union]] [[Sputnik crisis|shocked the American public]] with the launch of [[Sputnik]] on 4 October 1957, and the [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] successfully tested a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test on 8 November. The Anglo-American [[Special Relationship]] proved mutually beneficial, although it was never one of equals after the World Wars; the United States was (and is) far larger than Britain both militarily and economically. Britain soon became dependent on the United States for its nuclear weapons, as it lacked the resources to produce a range of designs. The treaty allowed American nuclear weapons to be supplied to Britain through [[Project E]], for use by the [[Royal Air Force]] and [[British Army of the Rhine]].\n\nThe treaty provided for the sale to the UK of one complete [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] plant, plus ten years' supply of [[enriched uranium]] to fuel it. Other nuclear material was also acquired from the United States under the treaty. Some 5.4 tonnes of UK-produced [[plutonium]] was sent to the US in return for {{convert|6.7|kg|lb}} of [[tritium]] and 7.5 tonnes of [[highly enriched uranium]] (HEU) between 1960 and 1979, although much of the HEU was used not for weapons, but as fuel for the growing fleet of UK [[nuclear submarine]]s. The treaty paved the way for the [[Polaris Sales Agreement]], and the [[Royal Navy]] ultimately acquired entire weapons systems, with the [[UK Polaris programme]] and [[Trident nuclear programme]] using American missiles with British nuclear warheads.\n\nThe treaty has been amended and renewed nine times.

To gain access to the stockpile for their own nuclear weapons project, the Americans opened negotiations that resulted in the ''[[Modus Vivendi]]'',{{sfn|Gowing|Arnold|1974a|pp=358\u2013360}} an agreement which was signed on 7 January 1948. This officially terminated all previous agreements, including the Quebec Agreement.

The United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. Further down the track, there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act.{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nThis was amended on 30 August 1954 by the [[Atomic Energy Act of 1954]], which allowed for greater exchange of information with foreign nations,{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=140\u2013141}} paving the way for the Agreement for Co-operation Regarding Atomic Information for Mutual Defence Purposes, which was signed on 15 June 1955.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=147\u2013149}} On 13 June 1956, another agreement was concluded, for the transfer of [[nuclear marine propulsion|nuclear submarine propulsion]] technology to Britain, saving the British government millions of pounds in research and development costs. This precipitated a row with the JCAE over whether this was permitted under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, and whether Britain met the security standards set by the 1955 agreement. With the [[1956 United States presidential election|1956 presidential election]] approaching, Eisenhower was forced to rescind the offer.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=161\u2013164}}\n\nThe October 1956 [[Suez Crisis]] brought relations between Britain and the United States to a low ebb.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=171\u2013174}} When Eisenhower met with the new Prime Minister, [[Harold Macmillan]], in Bermuda in March 1957, he raised the possibility of basing US [[intermediate range ballistic missile]] (IRBM) systems in the UK.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=174\u2013177}} This came to be called [[Project Emily]].{{sfn|Young|2016|pp=98\u201399}} There were also discussions on exchanging nuclear submarine propulsion technology for information on the British [[Calder Hall]] [[nuclear power plant]], allowing the [[United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority]] (UKAEA) to purchase uranium ore from Canada, and co-ordinating the war plans of [[RAF Bomber Command]] with those of the [[Strategic Air Command]].{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=180\u2013181}}\n\nAlthough the IRBM negotiations pre-dated the Suez Crisis, it suited the British government to tout the IRBM deal as a demonstration that the rift had been healed.{{sfn|Young|2007|p=8}} The [[British hydrogen bomb programme]] attempted to detonate a [[thermonuclear device]] in the [[Operation Grapple]] test series at [[Kiritimati|Christmas Island]] in the Pacific.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}} The test series was facilitated by the United States, which also claimed the island.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=159\u2013160}} Although the first tests were unsuccessful,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=147}} the Grapple X test on 8 November achieved the desired result.{{sfn|Baylis|1994|pp=166\u2013170}}{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|pp=160\u2013162}}\n==Negotiation==\n===Sputnik crisis===\n[[File:HD.3C.001 (13406014683).jpg|thumb|right|Eisenhower (left) lays the cornerstone for the new [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) building in [[Germantown, Maryland]], on 8 November 1957.

The Soviet Union's launch of [[Sputnik 1]], the world's first [[artificial satellite]], on 4 October 1957, came as a tremendous shock to the American public, who had trusted that American technological superiority ensured their invulnerability. Now, suddenly, there was incontrovertible proof that, in some areas at least, the Soviet Union was actually ahead. In the widespread calls for action in response to the [[Sputnik crisis]], officials in the United States and Britain seized an opportunity to mend their relationship.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=199\u2013201}} At the suggestion of [[Harold Caccia, Baron Caccia|Harold Caccia]], the [[List of Ambassadors from the United Kingdom to the United States|British Ambassador to the United States]], Macmillan wrote to Eisenhower on 10 October urging that the two countries pool their resources,{{sfn|Arnold|Pyne|2001|p=199}} as Macmillan put it, to meet the Soviet challenge on every front, \"military, economic and political\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1955-57v27/d306 |access-date=12 September 2017 |title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1955\u20131957, Western Europe and Canada, Volume XXVII \u2013 Document 306  |publisher=Office of the Historian, United States Department of State }}</ref>\n\nMacmillan flew to Washington, DC, for talks on 25 October.{{sfn|Divine|1993|p=34}} He had concerns that the disastrous 10 October [[Windscale fire]] might prove a stumbling block in negotiations,{{sfn|Baylis|2008|p=438}} as it might reflect badly on British expertise and provide ammunition for opponents of closer co-operation with the UK.

Under the July 1956 agreement and a February 1957 directive from Eisenhower, [[Royal Navy]] officers had been assigned to study the US Navy's nuclear submarine programme. By October 1957, its head, [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Hyman G. Rickover]], felt that their questions were slowing the deployment of the [[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]] submarine-launched IRBM at a critical time. He feared that any delay might cause Congress to favour land-based missiles. By December, the British liaison officers were complaining of slow response to their questions. Rickover proposed that [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] be permitted to sell the Royal Navy a nuclear submarine reactor, which would allow it to immediately proceed with building its own nuclear-powered submarine. The British government endorsed this idea, as it would save it a great deal of money.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=203}}{{sfn|Baylis|2008|pp=441\u2013442}}\n\n===Amending the McMahon Act===\nFor their part, the British wanted the McMahon Act's restrictions on nuclear co-operation to be relaxed.

Durham]], the chairman of the JCAE. Eisenhower met with congressional leaders on 3 December 1957, and pressed for more discretion to co-operate with all America's [[NATO]] allies, and not just Britain.{{sfn|Botti|1987|pp=207\u2013208}} Indeed the administration negotiated agreements with Australia, Canada and NATO.{{sfn|Botti|1987|p=214}} While Eisenhower did not yet have wholehearted support for the proposal, outright opposition from [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Clinton P.

It now limited exchanges of nuclear weapons data to nations that had made substantial progress in the field. The same restriction applied to the actual transfer of non-nuclear components of nuclear weapons. American nuclear weapons were to remain under US custody and could only be turned over to allies in the event of war. The sale of nuclear reactors for submarines and nuclear fuel for them and other military reactors was permitted.
