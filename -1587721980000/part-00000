After shrinking themselves down to a few inches tall by using Aviva's Miniaturizer invention, the Kratt brothers disguise themselves as crocodile eggs and sneak into a mother crocodile's new nest. In the Wild Kratts team's turtle-shaped aircraft and headquarters\u2014the Tortuga, one of Aviva's greatest inventions\u2014the Wild Kratts tech team, consisting of Aviva, communications expert and mechanic Koki ([[Heather Bambrick]]), and skilled pilot Jimmy Z (Jonathan Malen) monitor Chris and Martin and watch as the mother crocodile faithfully guards her nest against predators for months without even eating anything. Eventually, as the crocodile eggs hatch and the crocodile mom uses her mouth to carry several of her newly hatched babies to the river, Aviva changes her mind about crocodiles and decides that these reptiles are in fact caring and dedicated mothers. But when the mother crocodile leaves the river to go get more hatchlings from her nest, predators threaten the first batch of baby crocodiles.

There, they witness a never-before-seen wildlife moment: a battle between a sperm whale and a giant squid. However, the water pressure at the extreme depths where the battle is taking place badly damages and partially crushes the Amphisub, forcing Aviva to use her new ExtendoArm invention to pull the submersible back to the Tortuga. To allow Chris and Martin to return to the site of the whale-versus-squid battle, Aviva programs two new Creature Power Suits\u2014Sperm Whale Power for Chris, and Squid Power for Martin. The Kratt brothers use their new Creature Powers to dive back into the deep sea, where the sperm whale and the giant squid are still locked in combat. Suddenly, the sperm whale becomes entangled in a discarded fishing net and begins sinking toward an area full of underwater volcanoes. To make matters worse, a colossal squid attacks the sperm whale's calf.

Meanwhile an Indian gray mongoose shows up. Then Hoodie the cobra fights the mongoose and they learn about the mongoose's immunity to snake venom. Due to the mongoose's immmunity despite being bitten by Hoodie, he is unharmed by the snake's venom (however it is partial immunity, too much venom can be dangerous), and manages to kill Hoodie (and presumably eat him). They then get spectacled cobra powers and find the lost Miniaturizer, however there is a Bengal tiger sleeping next to it, they try to scare it away using venomous snake powers but the tiger goes on the Miniaturizer. Meanwhile Aviva and Koki stumble upon a large female king cobra, the largest venomous snake in the world, and it has a nest, which is unusual among snakes. Aviva names the snake Queenie. This inspires Aviva to modify the Indian cobra powers to king cobra power. However there is also a hungry male king cobra around which is bad for the bros as they have spectacled cobra powers and king cobras love eating other snakes. Eventually Chris gets caught by the king cobra and Martin has to activate king cobra powers to rescue Chris before his immunity meter gets high, and Martin ends up engaging in a fight with the male king cobra, which the snake is clearly bigger than Martin. Chris rescues Martin by activating king cobra powers and trying to look bigger than the king cobra. They then get their Miniaturizer back from the tiger. The Kratts and the rest of the team go back to Queenie's nest and watch as baby king cobras hatch.

However, the water pressure at the extreme depths where the battle is taking place badly damages and partially crushes the Amphisub, forcing Aviva to use her new ExtendoArm invention to pull the submersible back to the Tortuga. To allow Chris and Martin to return to the site of the whale-versus-squid battle, Aviva programs two new Creature Power Suits\u2014Sperm Whale Power for Chris, and Squid Power for Martin. The Kratt brothers use their new Creature Powers to dive back into the deep sea, where the sperm whale and the giant squid are still locked in combat.

Meanwhile an Indian gray mongoose shows up. Then Hoodie the cobra fights the mongoose and they learn about the mongoose's immunity to snake venom. Due to the mongoose's immmunity despite being bitten by Hoodie, he is unharmed by the snake's venom (however it is partial immunity, too much venom can be dangerous), and manages to kill Hoodie (and presumably eat him). They then get spectacled cobra powers and find the lost Miniaturizer, however there is a Bengal tiger sleeping next to it, they try to scare it away using venomous snake powers but the tiger goes on the Miniaturizer. Meanwhile Aviva and Koki stumble upon a large female king cobra, the largest venomous snake in the world, and it has a nest, which is unusual among snakes. Aviva names the snake Queenie. This inspires Aviva to modify the Indian cobra powers to king cobra power.

Eventually Chris gets caught by the king cobra and Martin has to activate king cobra powers to rescue Chris before his immunity meter gets high, and Martin ends up engaging in a fight with the male king cobra, which the snake is clearly bigger than Martin. Chris rescues Martin by activating king cobra powers and trying to look bigger than the king cobra. They then get their Miniaturizer back from the tiger.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was born on 17 February 1762, the second son of Francis Cooke (1728{{ndash}}1792) and his wife, Margaret (1729{{ndash}}1796), n\u00e9e Baker.{{r|\"JJH:51\"|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} Francis was the third son of the Reverend John Cooke and Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Dr. Thomas Sayer, Archdeacon of Surrey.{{r|\"BB:16\"}} Margaret was the second daughter of Moses and Mary Baker, of the Parish of [[St Christopher le Stocks]], in the [[City of London]].{{r|\"JJH:51\"||\"MB:Family\"}} The Cooke family line had come from [[Devon]], where they had been landowners and shipowners at Kenbury, near [[Exeter]], and [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]].{{r|\"JS:40\"}} The Reverend John Cooke was a former rector of [[Chilbolton]] and [[Bishop's Waltham]], and was appointed a [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] and 5th [[Prebendary|Prebendary]] of [[Winchester Cathedral]] by the patronage of [[Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet|Bishop Trelawny]].{{r|\"BB:16\"}}\n\nBy 1750, Francis was established at Greenwich as an [[Admiralty]] ledger writer, later Chief Cashier, in the Cashiers Branch of the [[Navy Pay Office (Royal Navy)|Navy Pay Office]], and as the [[Treasurer]] of the [[Greenwich Hospital, London]].{{r|\"NT:95\"|\"JS:40\"}} Francis married Margaret on 29 May 1757 at St{{nbsp}}Mary's, [[Chatham, Kent]].{{r|\"JJH:51\"}} John Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762, at the Cooke's home in the [[Tenterground]] at [[Goodman's Fields]], in the parish of [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]]. Sir [[HMS Bentley|John Bentley]] and William Henry Ricketts, were [[Godparent|godfathers]], Mrs Pigott of [[Bloomsbury Square]], was godmother.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{Ref label|B|b|none}} John's elder brother, Christopher, born 31 July 1759, was a Naval Agent, and made a great deal of money from the [[Napoleonic Wars|French Wars]]. He bought himself a country estate, Ashgrove, at [[Sevenoaks|Sevenoaks, Kent]], and set up there as a [[landed gentleman]].{{r|\"JS:40\"}}\n\n==Early naval career==\nJohn Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships.

Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. The gold medal and vase were gifted to the nation by Caroline Augusta Rolles, Cooke's great-granddaughter, after her on death on 14 January 1931.{{r|\"CAR:Gift\"}} At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke had leased Donhead Lodge from Baron [[Henry Arundell, 8th Baron Arundell of Wardour|Henry Arundell]] in 1803 and Louisa remained in residence there until 1813.{{r|\"JC:Donhead Lodge Release\"|\"DH:30\"}} She died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, [[County Cork]], at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|\"LCC:Marriage\"}} Formerly of [[Hinton Charterhouse]], she died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|\"LCC:Death\"}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], Cheltenham, on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bibliography of 18th\u201319th century Royal Naval history]]\n* [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS Bellerophon]]\n\n==Notes==\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|right|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T.

Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date. Cooke's baptism register entry, for the parish of St{{nbsp}}Mary, Whitechapel, records that he was \"borne {{sic}} 17th February\" and baptised \"in 4 Tenters\".{{r|\"John Cooke Baptism\"}} Tenters was then part of the [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]], [[London]].

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was born on 17 February 1762, the second son of Francis Cooke (1728{{ndash}}1792) and his wife, Margaret (1729{{ndash}}1796), n\u00e9e Baker.{{r|\"JJH:51\"|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} Francis was the third son of the Reverend John Cooke and Elizabeth, eldest daughter of Dr. Thomas Sayer, Archdeacon of Surrey.{{r|\"BB:16\"}} Margaret was the second daughter of Moses and Mary Baker, of the Parish of [[St Christopher le Stocks]], in the [[City of London]].{{r|\"JJH:51\"||\"MB:Family\"}} The Cooke family line had come from [[Devon]], where they had been landowners and shipowners at Kenbury, near [[Exeter]], and [[Topsham, Devon|Topsham]].{{r|\"JS:40\"}} The Reverend John Cooke was a former rector of [[Chilbolton]] and [[Bishop's Waltham]], and was appointed a [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] and 5th [[Prebendary|Prebendary]] of [[Winchester Cathedral]] by the patronage of [[Sir Jonathan Trelawny, 3rd Baronet|Bishop Trelawny]].{{r|\"BB:16\"}} By 1750, Francis was established at Greenwich as an [[Admiralty]] ledger writer, later Chief Cashier, in the Cashiers Branch of the [[Navy Pay Office (Royal Navy)|Navy Pay Office]], and as the [[Treasurer]] of the [[Greenwich Hospital, London]].{{r|\"NT:95\"|\"JS:40\"}} Francis married Margaret on 29 May 1757 at St{{nbsp}}Mary's, [[Chatham, Kent]].{{r|\"JJH:51\"}} John Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762, at the Cooke's home in the [[Tenterground]] at [[Goodman's Fields]], in the parish of [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]]. Sir [[HMS Bentley|John Bentley]] and William Henry Ricketts, were [[Godparent|godfathers]], Mrs Pigott of [[Bloomsbury Square]], was godmother.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{Ref label|B|b|none}} John's elder brother, Christopher, born 31 July 1759, was a Naval Agent, and made a great deal of money from the [[Napoleonic Wars|French Wars]]. He bought himself a country estate, Ashgrove, at [[Sevenoaks|Sevenoaks, Kent]], and set up there as a [[landed gentleman]].{{r|\"JS:40\"}}\n\n==Early naval career==\nJohn Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. The gold medal and vase were gifted to the nation by Caroline Augusta Rolles, Cooke's great-granddaughter, after her on death on 14 January 1931.{{r|\"CAR:Gift\"}} At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]].

Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date.

The shortest common outdoor running distance, it is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the [[sport of athletics]]. It has been contested at the [[Summer Olympics]] since 1896 for men and since 1928 for women. The [[100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics|World Championships 100 metres]] has been contested since 1983.\n\n[[File:Women's 100M Final - 28th Summer Universiade 2015 Gwangju.webm|thumbnail|Women's 100M Final \u2013 28th Summer Universiade 2015]]\n\nThe reigning [[100 metres at the Olympics|100&nbsp;m Olympic]] or world champion is often named \"the fastest man or woman in the world\". [[Christian Coleman]] and [[Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce]] are the reigning [[World Championships in Athletics|world champions]]; [[Usain Bolt]] and [[Elaine Thompson]] are the men's and women's [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] champions.\n\nOn an outdoor [[400 metres]] [[running track]], the 100&nbsp;m is run on the [[home straight]], with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race. There are three instructions given to the runners immediately before and at the beginning of the race: ready, set, and the firing of the [[starter's pistol]]. The runners move to the [[starting blocks]] when they hear the 'ready' instruction. The following instruction, to adopt the 'set' position, allows them to adopt a more efficient starting posture and [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometrically preload]] their muscles: this will help them to start faster. A race-official then fires the starter's pistol to signal the race beginning and the sprinters stride forwards from the blocks. Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50 and 60&nbsp;m. Their speed then slows towards the finish line.\n\nThe [[10-second barrier]] has historically been a barometer of fast men's performances, while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race. The current men's [[List of world records in athletics|world record]] is 9.58&nbsp;seconds, set by Jamaica's Usain Bolt in 2009, while the women's world record of 10.49&nbsp;seconds set by American [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]] in 1988 remains unbroken.{{efn|name=10.49}}\n\nThe 100&nbsp;m (109.361 yards) emerged from the metrication of the [[100-yard dash|100&nbsp;yards]] (91.44 m), a now defunct distance originally contested in English-speaking countries. The event is largely held outdoors as few indoor facilities have a 100&nbsp;m straight.\n\nUS athletes have won the men's Olympic 100 metres title more times than any other country, 16 out of the 28 times that it has been run. US women have also dominated the event winning 9 out of 21 times.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Race dynamics==\n===Start===\n[[File:20070701-nk2007-100m.jpg|thumb|right|Male sprinters await the starter's instructions]]\n\nAt the start, some athletes play psychological games such as trying to be last to the [[starting blocks]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Bob Harris|author2=Ramela Mills|author3=Shanon Parker-Bennett|title=BTEC First Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2apWjFFg94C&pg=PA35|date=22 June 2004|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0-435-45460-9|page=35}}</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19830123&id=uwMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z3UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1446,4230157 The Day \u2013 23 January 1983]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.athleticsweekly.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3893 |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729032958/http://www.athleticsweekly.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3893 |archive-date=29 July 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nAt high level meets, the time between the gun and first kick against the starting block is measured electronically, via sensors built in the gun and the blocks. A reaction time less than 0.1&nbsp;s is considered a [[false start]]. The 0.2-second interval accounts for the sum of the time it takes for the sound of the starter's pistol to reach the runners' ears, and the time they take to react to it.\n\nFor many years a sprinter was disqualified if responsible for two false starts individually. However, this rule allowed some major races to be restarted so many times that the sprinters started to lose focus. The next iteration of the rule, introduced in February 2003, meant that one false start was allowed among the field, but anyone responsible for a subsequent false start was disqualified.\n\nThis rule led to some sprinters deliberately false-starting to gain a psychological advantage: an individual with a slower [[reaction time]] might false-start, forcing the faster starters to wait and be sure of hearing the gun for the subsequent start, thereby losing some of their advantage. To avoid such abuse and to improve spectator enjoyment, the [[IAAF]] implemented a further change in the 2010 season \u2013 a false starting athlete now receives immediate disqualification.<ref>{{cite news |title=IAAF keeps one false-start rule |publisher=BBC  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/athletics/4433815.stm |accessdate=15 August 2008 | date=3 August 2005}}</ref> This proposal was met with objections when first raised in 2005, on the grounds that it would not leave any room for innocent mistakes.

When the placing of the athletes is not obvious, a [[photo finish]] is used to distinguish which runner was first to cross the line.\n\n===Climatic conditions===\n{{see also|wind assistance}}\n\nClimatic conditions, in particular air resistance, can affect performances in the 100 m. A strong head wind is very detrimental to performance, while a tail wind can improve performances significantly. For this reason, a maximum tail wind of 2.0&nbsp;m/s is allowed for a 100&nbsp;m performance to be considered eligible for records, or \"wind legal\".\n\nFurthermore, sprint athletes perform a better run at high altitudes because of the thinner air, which provides less air resistance. In theory, the thinner air would also make breathing slightly more difficult (due to the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen being lower), but this difference is negligible for sprint distances where all the oxygen needed for the short dash is already in the muscles and bloodstream when the race starts. While there are no limitations on altitude, performances made at altitudes greater than 1000&nbsp;m above sea level are marked with an \"A\".<ref name=IAAF>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/trackfield/newsid=4666.html 100 metres] IAAF</ref>\n\n==10-second barrier==\n{{main|10-second barrier}}\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{{main|Race and sports}}\n\nOnly male sprinters have beaten the 100&nbsp;m [[10-second barrier]], majority of them being of [[West African]] descent.

'''100&nbsp;metres''', or '''100-metre dash''', is a [[sprint (running)|sprint race]] in [[track and field]] competitions. The shortest common outdoor running distance, it is one of the most popular and prestigious events in the [[sport of athletics]]. It has been contested at the [[Summer Olympics]] since 1896 for men and since 1928 for women. The [[100 metres at the World Championships in Athletics|World Championships 100 metres]] has been contested since 1983.\n\n[[File:Women's 100M Final - 28th Summer Universiade 2015 Gwangju.webm|thumbnail|Women's 100M Final \u2013 28th Summer Universiade 2015]]\n\nThe reigning [[100 metres at the Olympics|100&nbsp;m Olympic]] or world champion is often named \"the fastest man or woman in the world\". [[Christian Coleman]] and [[Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce]] are the reigning [[World Championships in Athletics|world champions]]; [[Usain Bolt]] and [[Elaine Thompson]] are the men's and women's [[Athletics at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] champions.\n\nOn an outdoor [[400 metres]] [[running track]], the 100&nbsp;m is run on the [[home straight]], with the start usually being set on an extension to make it a straight-line race. There are three instructions given to the runners immediately before and at the beginning of the race: ready, set, and the firing of the [[starter's pistol]]. The runners move to the [[starting blocks]] when they hear the 'ready' instruction. The following instruction, to adopt the 'set' position, allows them to adopt a more efficient starting posture and [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometrically preload]] their muscles: this will help them to start faster. A race-official then fires the starter's pistol to signal the race beginning and the sprinters stride forwards from the blocks. Sprinters typically reach top speed after somewhere between 50 and 60&nbsp;m. Their speed then slows towards the finish line.\n\nThe [[10-second barrier]] has historically been a barometer of fast men's performances, while the best female sprinters take eleven seconds or less to complete the race. The current men's [[List of world records in athletics|world record]] is 9.58&nbsp;seconds, set by Jamaica's Usain Bolt in 2009, while the women's world record of 10.49&nbsp;seconds set by American [[Florence Griffith-Joyner]] in 1988 remains unbroken.{{efn|name=10.49}}\n\nThe 100&nbsp;m (109.361 yards) emerged from the metrication of the [[100-yard dash|100&nbsp;yards]] (91.44 m), a now defunct distance originally contested in English-speaking countries. The event is largely held outdoors as few indoor facilities have a 100&nbsp;m straight.\n\nUS athletes have won the men's Olympic 100 metres title more times than any other country, 16 out of the 28 times that it has been run. US women have also dominated the event winning 9 out of 21 times.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Race dynamics==\n===Start===\n[[File:20070701-nk2007-100m.jpg|thumb|right|Male sprinters await the starter's instructions]]\n\nAt the start, some athletes play psychological games such as trying to be last to the [[starting blocks]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Bob Harris|author2=Ramela Mills|author3=Shanon Parker-Bennett|title=BTEC First Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2apWjFFg94C&pg=PA35|date=22 June 2004|publisher=Heinemann|isbn=978-0-435-45460-9|page=35}}</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&dat=19830123&id=uwMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Z3UFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1446,4230157 The Day \u2013 23 January 1983]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.athleticsweekly.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3893 |title=Archived copy |access-date=23 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729032958/http://www.athleticsweekly.com/messageboard/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=3893 |archive-date=29 July 2014 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nAt high level meets, the time between the gun and first kick against the starting block is measured electronically, via sensors built in the gun and the blocks. A reaction time less than 0.1&nbsp;s is considered a [[false start]]. The 0.2-second interval accounts for the sum of the time it takes for the sound of the starter's pistol to reach the runners' ears, and the time they take to react to it.\n\nFor many years a sprinter was disqualified if responsible for two false starts individually. However, this rule allowed some major races to be restarted so many times that the sprinters started to lose focus. The next iteration of the rule, introduced in February 2003, meant that one false start was allowed among the field, but anyone responsible for a subsequent false start was disqualified.\n\nThis rule led to some sprinters deliberately false-starting to gain a psychological advantage: an individual with a slower [[reaction time]] might false-start, forcing the faster starters to wait and be sure of hearing the gun for the subsequent start, thereby losing some of their advantage. To avoid such abuse and to improve spectator enjoyment, the [[IAAF]] implemented a further change in the 2010 season \u2013 a false starting athlete now receives immediate disqualification.<ref>{{cite news |title=IAAF keeps one false-start rule |publisher=BBC  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/athletics/4433815.stm |accessdate=15 August 2008 | date=3 August 2005}}</ref> This proposal was met with objections when first raised in 2005, on the grounds that it would not leave any room for innocent mistakes.

When the placing of the athletes is not obvious, a [[photo finish]] is used to distinguish which runner was first to cross the line.\n\n===Climatic conditions===\n{{see also|wind assistance}}\n\nClimatic conditions, in particular air resistance, can affect performances in the 100 m. A strong head wind is very detrimental to performance, while a tail wind can improve performances significantly. For this reason, a maximum tail wind of 2.0&nbsp;m/s is allowed for a 100&nbsp;m performance to be considered eligible for records, or \"wind legal\".\n\nFurthermore, sprint athletes perform a better run at high altitudes because of the thinner air, which provides less air resistance. In theory, the thinner air would also make breathing slightly more difficult (due to the [[partial pressure]] of oxygen being lower), but this difference is negligible for sprint distances where all the oxygen needed for the short dash is already in the muscles and bloodstream when the race starts. While there are no limitations on altitude, performances made at altitudes greater than 1000&nbsp;m above sea level are marked with an \"A\".<ref name=IAAF>[http://www.iaaf.org/community/athletics/trackfield/newsid=4666.html 100 metres] IAAF</ref>\n\n==10-second barrier==\n{{main|10-second barrier}}\n\n===Ethnicity===\n{{main|Race and sports}}\n\nOnly male sprinters have beaten the 100&nbsp;m [[10-second barrier]], majority of them being of [[West African]] descent.

The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. \n\nRabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Torah studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with ''Hesder'' and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A ''Dati Leumi'' girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''Hardal'' community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \nStudents at Mercaz HaRav, and some Hardal yeshivot, undertake their Service through a modified form of Hesder.\n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF. The IDF undertook that all modesty and kosher issues will be handled in order to make female Religious Zionists comfortable.\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', or \"sruggim\", referring to the knitted or crocheted ''[[kippot]]'' (skullcaps) worn by the men. (Many wear other types of headcoverings, such as black velvet ''kippot''.) \nTheir dress, otherwise, is largely the same as for secular Israelis; beards are uncommon, although mustaches are often seen in the older generations.\nWomen usually wear skirts, and often cover their hair.\nSee under [[Tzniut]]: [[Tzniut#Dress|#Dress]] and [[Tzniut#Hair covering|#Hair covering]].\n\nIn the ''Hardal'' community, the dress is generally more formal, with an emphasis on appearing neat.  \nThe Kippot, also knitted, are significantly larger, and it is common for [[tzitzit]] to be worn visibly, as is the [[Haredi]] practice; ''[[Payot]]'' (sidelocks) are similarly common, as is an (untrimmed) beard.\nWomen invariably cover their hair - usually with a [[snood]], or a ''mitpachat'' (Hebrew for \"kerchief\") - and often wear sandals.\n\nAt prayer, members of the community use the [[Koren Siddur]] or ''[[Rinat Yisrael]]''.\n\n== Notable figures ==\n* [[Yehuda Amital]]\n* [[Eli Sadan]] \n* [[Shlomo Aviner]]\n* [[Naftali Bennett]]\n* [[Yosef Burg]]\n* [[She'ar Yashuv Cohen]]\n* [[Haim Druckman]]\n* [[Effi Eitam]]\n* [[Mordechai Eliyahu]]\n* [[Moshe Feiglin]]\n* [[Shlomo Goren]]\n* [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]]\n* [[Meir Kahane]]\n* [[Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane]]\n* [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]\n* [[Avraham Yitzchak Kook]]\n* [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]]\n* [[Dov Lior]]\n* [[Rafi Peretz]]\n* [[Zevulun Orlev]]\n* [[Shlomo Riskin]]\n* [[Avraham Shapira]]\n* [[Shaul Yisraeli]]\n* [[Oury Amos Cherki]]\n* [[Bezalel Smotrich]]\n* [[Baruch Marzel]]\n* [[Michael Ben-Ari]]\n* [[Baruch Goldstein]]\n* [[Yisrael Ariel]]\n* [[Yehuda Glick]]\n* [[Aharon Lichtenstein]]\n* [[Yaakov Ariel]]\n* [[Jonathan Sacks]]\n* [[Hanan Porat]]\n* [[Zvi Thau]]\n* [[Yaaqov Medan]]\n* [[Haim Sabato]]\n* [[Nahum Rabinovitch]]\n* [[Robert Aumann]]\n* [[Uri Orbach]]\n* [[Meir Bar-Ilan]]\n* [[Shimon Gershon Rosenberg]]\n* [[Joseph B.

Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. \n\nRabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with ''Hesder'' and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]]. A ''Dati Leumi'' girls' high school is referred to as an ''[[Ulpana]]''.\n\nSome institutions are aligned with the ''Hardal'' community, with an ideology that is somewhat more \"statist\".\nThe leading Yeshiva here is [[Har Hamor]]; [[Hardal#Schools|several high schools]] also operate.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \nStudents at Mercaz HaRav, and some Hardal yeshivot, undertake their Service through a modified form of Hesder.\n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF. The IDF undertook that all modesty and kosher issues will be handled in order to make female Religious Zionists comfortable.\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', or \"sruggim\", referring to the knitted or crocheted ''[[kippot]]'' (skullcaps) worn by the men. (Many wear other types of headcoverings, such as black velvet ''kippot''.) \nTheir dress, otherwise, is largely the same as for secular Israelis; beards are uncommon, although mustaches are often seen in the older generations.\nWomen usually wear skirts, and often cover their hair.\nSee under [[Tzniut]]: [[Tzniut#Dress|#Dress]] and [[Tzniut#Hair covering|#Hair covering]].\n\nIn the ''Hardal'' community, the dress is generally more formal, with an emphasis on appearing neat.  \nThe Kippot, also knitted, are significantly larger, and it is common for [[tzitzit]] to be worn visibly, as is the [[Haredi]] practice; ''[[Payot]]'' (sidelocks) are similarly common, as is an (untrimmed) beard.\nWomen invariably cover their hair - usually with a [[snood]], or a ''mitpachat'' (Hebrew for \"kerchief\") - and often wear sandals.\n\nAt prayer, members of the community use the [[Koren Siddur]] or ''[[Rinat Yisrael]]''.\n\n== Notable figures ==\n* [[Yehuda Amital]]\n* [[Eli Sadan]] \n* [[Shlomo Aviner]]\n* [[Naftali Bennett]]\n* [[Yosef Burg]]\n* [[She'ar Yashuv Cohen]]\n* [[Haim Druckman]]\n* [[Effi Eitam]]\n* [[Mordechai Eliyahu]]\n* [[Moshe Feiglin]]\n* [[Shlomo Goren]]\n* [[Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog]]\n* [[Meir Kahane]]\n* [[Binyamin Ze'ev Kahane]]\n* [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]\n* [[Avraham Yitzchak Kook]]\n* [[Zvi Yehuda Kook]]\n* [[Dov Lior]]\n* [[Rafi Peretz]]\n* [[Zevulun Orlev]]\n* [[Shlomo Riskin]]\n* [[Avraham Shapira]]\n* [[Shaul Yisraeli]]\n* [[Oury Amos Cherki]]\n* [[Bezalel Smotrich]]\n* [[Baruch Marzel]]\n* [[Michael Ben-Ari]]\n* [[Baruch Goldstein]]\n* [[Yisrael Ariel]]\n* [[Yehuda Glick]]\n* [[Aharon Lichtenstein]]\n* [[Yaakov Ariel]]\n* [[Jonathan Sacks]]\n* [[Hanan Porat]]\n* [[Zvi Thau]]\n* [[Yaaqov Medan]]\n* [[Haim Sabato]]\n* [[Nahum Rabinovitch]]\n* [[Robert Aumann]]\n* [[Uri Orbach]]\n* [[Meir Bar-Ilan]]\n* [[Shimon Gershon Rosenberg]]\n* [[Joseph B.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the process of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new administrative county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire. \n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established during the [[heptarchy]], as an administrative and defensive unit.

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 8) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation.

West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities. The original county council's responsibility for services within the majority of the conurbation were curtailed and association with the historic [[shire]] was for ceremonial purposes only. The West Midlands Special Review Area included Dudley, Oldbury, Stourbridge and Halesowen (as per Fig. 8). The latter two council areas were not incorporated into a county borough, as part of the eventual ''West Midlands Order 1965''. Halesowen was proposed to be included within an enlarged Smethwick County Borough, but a successful campaign entitled \"Hands off Halesowen\" orchestrated by a non-partisan group called the \"Halesowen Independence Committee\" helped stop the plans.<ref>[http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk Black Country Bugle] [http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html Hands off Halesowen \u2013 Town's 1960 Campaign For Independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814151133/http://www.blackcountrybugle.co.uk/hands-Hales-Owen-Towns-1960-Campaign-Independence/story-20123386-detail/story.html |date=14 August 2014 }} \u2013 Retrieved 13 August 2014</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the second report into the West Midland General Review area was also delivered in July 1961 and a proposal for Worcester to lose its county borough status<ref>The British Medical Journal \u2013 Vol. 1, No. 5242, 24 June 1961 \"Local Government Commission's Reports on West Midlands\"</ref> was not implemented.<ref>\"How Local government Areas Stand Today\", The Times, 12 February 1966</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Order 1965===\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 250\n| image1 = West_Midlands_Order_1965.png\n| caption1 =  Fig 9: The boundaries of South Staffordshire, West Warwickshire and North Worcestershire after the local government reorganisations of the 1960s.\n| image2 = Warley map.png\n| caption2 = The County Borough of Warley \u2013 Warley's boundaries are shown as blue.

There were many detached parts of [[Worcestershire]] in the surrounding counties, and conversely there were islands of other counties within Worcestershire.  The 1844'' [[Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844|Counties (Detached Parts) Act]]'' began the process of eliminating these, but the process was not completed until 1966, when [[Dudley]] was absorbed into [[Staffordshire]].\n\nThe expansion of [[Birmingham]] and the [[Black Country]] during and after the [[Industrial Revolution]] also altered the county map considerably.  Local government commissions were set up to recommend changes to the local government structures, and as early as 1945 recommendations were made to merge Worcestershire with [[Herefordshire]].  Eventually in 1974, a form of this recommendation was carried out, most of Worcestershire was combined with Herefordshire to form a new county named [[Hereford & Worcester]], while the northern Black Country towns and villages of Worcestershire, along with adjoining areas of Staffordshire and [[Warwickshire]], formed the new administrative county of [[West Midlands County|West Midlands]].\n\nHereford & Worcester was re-divided into the separate counties of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in 1998. Since that time Worcestershire's boundaries have not changed. [[Redditch]] opted to join the [[West Midlands Combined Authority]] as an associate 'non-constituent' member in October 2015, although this will not affect the borough's status within Worcestershire. \n\n==Boundaries before 1844==\n[[Worcestershire]] was established during the [[heptarchy]], as an administrative and defensive unit. Its purpose was to take into account and defend the estates within the historic [[Anglican_Diocese_of_Worcester|See of Worcester]], held by the [[Bishop of Worcester|Episcopus Hwicciorum]], [[Worcester Cathedral|Worcester Priory]] and the abbeys of [[Pershore Abbey|Pershore]] and [[Evesham Abbey|Evesham]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Worcestershire|last=Brooks|first=Alan|last2=Pevsner|first2=Nikolaus|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2007|isbn=9780300112986|location=New Haven and London|pages=2}}</ref> No fewer than 13 monastic foundations existed in the area, between the 8th and 13th centuries.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/ Encyclopedia Britannica] [https://www.britannica.com/place/Worcestershire-county-England Worcestershire County, England, United Kingdom] - Retrieved 22 February 2020</ref> A 'proto-shire' was believed to exist prior to the county formation, centred upon a fortified [[burh]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.stourbridgewesternboundary.kjdocs.co.uk/Stourbridge%20Western%20Boundary.pdf|title=Stourbridge's Western Boundary: A cornerstone of the historical landscape|last=James BSc(Hons) MSc PhD FIAP|first=K|date=11 April 2018|website=Stourbridge's Western Boundary|access-date=11 April 2018}}</ref> The boundaries for this 'proto-shire' and the early established county are unknown.

The proposals would have also seen [[Smethwick]] join Worcestershire, plus [[Burford,_Shropshire|Burford]] (uniting all of [[Tenbury]] [[rural sanitary district]] into one county), [[Ipsley]], [[Upper Arley]], [[Pebworth]] and [[West Malvern]]. The proposed border with Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Herefordshire would have seen considerable exchanges of parishes, thus eliminating all of Worcestershire's exclaves/enclaves.<ref>''The Boundary Commission'', The Times, 28 March 1888</ref> This Act was repealed in favour of the alternative ''[[Local Government Act 1888]]''.

Other similar urban areas in England, such as [[Lancashire]], [[Tyneside]], [[London]] and within [[Yorkshire West Riding]], had grown in size since the Industrial Revolution. The expansion of these conurbations saw economic and physical integration with neighbouring towns and communities. This process became more prominent due to growing housing issues, extensive bombing during World War II, slum clearance, and continuing migration into urban areas. The Black Country contained a combination of county boroughs, urban districts, municipal boroughs and county councils (See Fig 8) taking responsibility for services, which resulted in a fragmented local government infrastructure. The ''[[Local Government Act 1958]]'' appointed a Local Government Commission to review administrative structures and boundaries in England outside London. The Act designated a ''West Midlands Special Review Area'',<ref>Local Government Act 1958 c.55</ref> whose recommendations would ultimately form the ''West Midlands Order 1965'' legislation.

West Midlands General Review</ref>\n\n===West Midlands Special Review Area===\nThe commission made its report in July 1961.  It recommended that the Black Country area should be administered by large county boroughs, and that the remaining urban districts or municipal boroughs be merged into these authorities.

Hindu, Buddhist, Tantric, and Islamic views that were current in medieval India come together in the wide-ranging literary spectrum of the GGS. The stereotypical oppositions between the Indic and Abrahamic worldviews of the day are transcended: \"Some call it Rama, some call it Khuda; some worship it as Vishnu, some as Allah\" (GGS: 885). Interestingly, even the atheistic Buddhist Nirvana is not omitted: \"Itself Nirvana, It itself relishes pleasures\" (GGS: 97). \"God\" or \"gods\" or \"no god\" alike are recognized as part of the infinite One! \"Always, always you alone are the One Reality\u2014sada sada tun eku hai\" (GGS: 139). Persian terminology is used to emphasize the unity of being: \"asti ek digari kui ek tui ek tui \u2014Only the One is, there is none other; Only you, you only\" (GGS: 144). Again, \"hindu turk ka sahib ek\u2014Hindus and Muslims share the One sovereign\" (GGS: 1158). (The term \"Turk\" referred to all Muslims in this period.) Since everything is a manifestation of That One being, all the manifestations would be a part of it.

The daily recitation of the divine name of God Vaheguru and from memory of specific passages from the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib, like the ''Japu'' (or ''Japj\u012b'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptized Sikhs recite the five morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurdu\u0101r\u0101'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard\u0101s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name=\"p260\">{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of \"[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]\" or the community meal.

Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the [[partition of India|land was partitioned]] into Hindu majority India and Muslim majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. This event, states Banga, was a watershed event in Sikh history.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\">{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani|title=Sikh Nationalism and Identity in a Global Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKu66SixH6AC |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-10189-4|pages=86\u201393}}</ref> The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line (\"[[Radcliffe Line]]\"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the [[Muslim League]] demands and saw it as \"perpetuation of Muslim domination\" and anti-Sikh policies in what just a 100 years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition and for the recognition of Sikhs as the third community.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} In 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of [[Komagata Maru incident|Komagata Maru in Canada]] proposed the idea of Khalistan as a buffer state between Pakistan and India.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} These leaders, however, were largely ignored.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> Many other Sikh leaders supported the partition along religious and demographic lines.<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\">{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia's Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TBscBQAAQBAJ |year =2014|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-62446-2|pages=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nWhen partition was announced, the newly created line divided the Sikh population into two halves. The Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan, and Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side leaving behind their property and the sacred places of Sikhism. This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite and wealthiest in West Punjab, with them having the largest representation in West Punjab's aristocracy, nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of [[jhatka]] versus [[halal]] meat, the disputed ownership of [[Shaheed Ganj Mosque|Gurdwara Sahidganj]] in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government in switching from Indian [[Gurmukhi]] script to Arabic-Persian [[Nastaliq]] script in schools.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} During and after the [[Simla Conference]] in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as the third party, but ultimately relegated their demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}}\n[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]\n\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as \"civil war\", while [[Lord Mountbatten]] stated \"civil war preparations were going on\". The riots had triggered the early waves of migration in April, with some 20,000 people leaving northwest Punjab and moving to Patiala.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> In Rawalpindi, 40,000 people became homeless. The Sikh leaders made desperate petitions, but all religious communities were suffering in the political turmoil. Sikhs, states Banga, were \"only 4 million out of a total of 28&nbsp;million in Punjab, and 6&nbsp;million out of nearly 400&nbsp;million in India; they did not constitute the majority, not even in a single district\".{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}<ref name=\"Wolpert2010p9\">{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=India and Pakistan: Continued Conflict or Cooperation?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbEvmBKPgBoC |year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-94800-6|pages=9\u201312, 16\u201323}}</ref>\n\nWhen the partition line was formally announced in August 1947, the violence was unprecedented, with Sikhs being one of the most affected religious community both in terms of deaths, as well as property loss, injury, trauma and disruption.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=108\u2013111}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Sikhs and Muslims were both victims and perpetrators of retaliatory violence against each other.

The partition created the \"largest foot convoy of refugees recorded in [human] history, stretching over 100 kilometer long\", states Banga, with nearly 300,000 people consisting of mostly \"distraught, suffering, injured and angry Sikhs\".

Although decried by Sikhism, Sikhs have practiced a caste system. The system, along with untouchability, has been more common in rural parts of Punjab.The landowning dominant Sikh castes, states Jodhka, \"have not shed all their prejudices against the lower castes or [[dalits]]; while dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurdwaras they would not be permitted to cook or serve langar.\" The Sikh dalits of Punjab have tried to build their own gurdwara, other local level institutions and sought better material circumstances and dignity.

Despite being very small in numbers, the Kshatriya [[Khatri]] and [[Arora]] castes wield considerable influence within the Sikh community.

Sikh festivals such as Vaisakhi and [[Bandi Chhor Divas|Bandi Chhor]] are celebrated in those Canadian cities by the largest groups of followers in the world outside the Punjab.\n\nSikhs also migrated to East Africa, West Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia.

Hindu, Buddhist, Tantric, and Islamic views that were current in medieval India come together in the wide-ranging literary spectrum of the GGS. The stereotypical oppositions between the Indic and Abrahamic worldviews of the day are transcended: \"Some call it Rama, some call it Khuda; some worship it as Vishnu, some as Allah\" (GGS: 885). Interestingly, even the atheistic Buddhist Nirvana is not omitted: \"Itself Nirvana, It itself relishes pleasures\" (GGS: 97). \"God\" or \"gods\" or \"no god\" alike are recognized as part of the infinite One! \"Always, always you alone are the One Reality\u2014sada sada tun eku hai\" (GGS: 139). Persian terminology is used to emphasize the unity of being: \"asti ek digari kui ek tui ek tui \u2014Only the One is, there is none other; Only you, you only\" (GGS: 144). Again, \"hindu turk ka sahib ek\u2014Hindus and Muslims share the One sovereign\" (GGS: 1158). (The term \"Turk\" referred to all Muslims in this period.) Since everything is a manifestation of That One being, all the manifestations would be a part of it.

The daily recitation of the divine name of God Vaheguru and from memory of specific passages from the Gur\u016b Granth S\u0101hib, like the ''Japu'' (or ''Japj\u012b'', literally ''chant'') hymns is recommended immediately after rising and bathing. Baptized Sikhs recite the five morning prayers, the evening and night prayer. Family customs include both reading passages from the scripture and attending the [[gurudwara|gurdwara]] (also ''gurdu\u0101r\u0101'', meaning ''the doorway to God''; sometimes transliterated as ''gurudwara''). There are many gurdwaras prominently constructed and maintained across India, as well as in almost every nation where Sikhs reside. Gurdwaras are open to all, regardless of religion, background, caste, or race.\n\nWorship in a gurdwara consists chiefly of singing of passages from the scripture. Sikhs will commonly enter the gurdwara, touch the ground before the holy scripture with their foreheads. The recitation of the eighteenth century ''[[ard\u0101s]]'' is also customary for attending Sikhs. The ard\u0101s recalls past sufferings and glories of the community, invoking divine grace for all humanity.<ref name=\"p260\">{{cite book|last=Parrinder|first=Geoffrey|authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder|year=1971|title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|location=United States|isbn=978-0-87196-129-7|page=260}}</ref>\n\nThe gurdwara is also the location for the historic Sikh practice of \"[[Langar (Sikhism)|Langar]]\" or the community meal.

Ultimately when the British Empire recognized independent India, the [[partition of India|land was partitioned]] into Hindu majority India and Muslim majority Pakistan (East and West) in 1947. This event, states Banga, was a watershed event in Sikh history.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\">{{cite book|author=Giorgio Shani|title=Sikh Nationalism and Identity in a Global Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HKu66SixH6AC |year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-10189-4|pages=86\u201393}}</ref> The Sikhs had historically lived in northwestern region of Indian subcontinent on both sides of the partition line (\"[[Radcliffe Line]]\"). According to Banga and other scholars, the Sikhs had strongly opposed the [[Muslim League]] demands and saw it as \"perpetuation of Muslim domination\" and anti-Sikh policies in what just a 100 years before was a part of the Sikh Empire. During the discussions with the colonial authorities, Tara Singh emerged as an important leader who campaigned to prevent the partition and for the recognition of Sikhs as the third community.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} In 1940, a few Sikhs such as the victims of [[Komagata Maru incident|Komagata Maru in Canada]] proposed the idea of Khalistan as a buffer state between Pakistan and India.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} These leaders, however, were largely ignored.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> Many other Sikh leaders supported the partition along religious and demographic lines.<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\">{{cite book|author=Michael Mann|title=South Asia's Modern History: Thematic Perspectives|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TBscBQAAQBAJ |year =2014|publisher= Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-62446-2|pages=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nWhen partition was announced, the newly created line divided the Sikh population into two halves. The Sikhs suffered organized violence and riots against them in West Pakistan, and Sikhs moved en masse to the Indian side leaving behind their property and the sacred places of Sikhism. This reprisals on Sikhs were not one sided, because as Sikhs entered the Indian side, the Muslims in East Punjab experienced reprisals and they moved to West Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Before the partition, Sikhs constituted about 15% of the population in West Punjab that became a part of Pakistan, the majority being Muslims (55%). The Sikhs were the economic elite and wealthiest in West Punjab, with them having the largest representation in West Punjab's aristocracy, nearly 700 Gurdwaras and 400 educational institutions that served the interests of the Sikhs.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013103}} Prior to the partition, there were a series of disputes between the majority Muslims and minority Sikhs, such as on the matters of [[jhatka]] versus [[halal]] meat, the disputed ownership of [[Shaheed Ganj Mosque|Gurdwara Sahidganj]] in Lahore which Muslims sought as a mosque and Sikhs as a Gurdwara, and the insistence of the provincial Muslim government in switching from Indian [[Gurmukhi]] script to Arabic-Persian [[Nastaliq]] script in schools.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013100}} During and after the [[Simla Conference]] in June 1945, headed by Lord Wavell, the Sikh leaders initially expressed their desire to be recognized as the third party, but ultimately relegated their demands and sought a United India where Sikhs, Hindus and Muslims would live together, under a Swiss style constitution. The Muslim League rejected this approach, demanding that entire Punjab should be granted to Pakistan.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}} The Sikh leaders then sought the partition instead, and Congress Working Committee passed a resolution in support of partitioning Punjab and Bengal.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=99\u2013104}}\n[[File:Sikh Light Infantry.jpg|thumb|[[Sikh Light Infantry]] personnel march past during the Republic day parade in [[New Delhi]], India]]\n\nBetween March and August 1947, a series of riots, arson, plunder of Sikh property, assassination of Sikh leaders, and killings in Jhelum districts, Rawalpindi, Attock and other places made Tara Singh call the situation in Punjab as \"civil war\", while [[Lord Mountbatten]] stated \"civil war preparations were going on\". The riots had triggered the early waves of migration in April, with some 20,000 people leaving northwest Punjab and moving to Patiala.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}<ref name=\"Shani2007p86\"/> In Rawalpindi, 40,000 people became homeless. The Sikh leaders made desperate petitions, but all religious communities were suffering in the political turmoil. Sikhs, states Banga, were \"only 4 million out of a total of 28&nbsp;million in Punjab, and 6&nbsp;million out of nearly 400&nbsp;million in India; they did not constitute the majority, not even in a single district\".{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=104\u2013105}}<ref name=\"Wolpert2010p9\">{{cite book|author=Stanley Wolpert|title=India and Pakistan: Continued Conflict or Cooperation?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbEvmBKPgBoC |year=2010|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-94800-6|pages=9\u201312, 16\u201323}}</ref>\n\nWhen the partition line was formally announced in August 1947, the violence was unprecedented, with Sikhs being one of the most affected religious community both in terms of deaths, as well as property loss, injury, trauma and disruption.{{sfn|Banga|2017|pp=108\u2013111}}<ref name=\"Mann2014p81\"/> Sikhs and Muslims were both victims and perpetrators of retaliatory violence against each other.

The partition created the \"largest foot convoy of refugees recorded in [human] history, stretching over 100 kilometer long\", states Banga, with nearly 300,000 people consisting of mostly \"distraught, suffering, injured and angry Sikhs\".

Although decried by Sikhism, Sikhs have practiced a caste system. The system, along with untouchability, has been more common in rural parts of Punjab.The landowning dominant Sikh castes, states Jodhka, \"have not shed all their prejudices against the lower castes or [[dalits]]; while dalits would be allowed entry into the village gurdwaras they would not be permitted to cook or serve langar.\" The Sikh dalits of Punjab have tried to build their own gurdwara, other local level institutions and sought better material circumstances and dignity. According to Jodhka, due to economic mobility in contemporary Punjab, castes no longer mean an inherited occupation nor are work relations tied to a single location.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jodhka|first1=Surinder S|title=Caste and Untouchability in Rural Punjab|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|date=11\u201317 May 2002|volume= 37|issue=19|pages=1813\u20131823|jstor=4412102}}</ref>\nIn 1953, the government of India acceded to the demands of the Sikh leader, [[Tara Singh (activist)|Master Tara Singh]], to include Sikh dalit castes in the list of scheduled castes.<ref name=\"Harish K.

Despite being very small in numbers, the Kshatriya [[Khatri]] and [[Arora]] castes wield considerable influence within the Sikh community. Other common Sikh castes include [[Saini]]s, [[Ramgarhia]]s (artisans), [[Ahluwalia (caste)|Ahluwalias]] (formerly brewers), [[Kamboj]]s (rural caste), [[Labana]]s, [[Kumhar]]s and the two Dalit castes, known in Sikh terminology as the [[Mazhabi]]s (the Chuhras) and the [[Ravidasia]]s (the Chamars).<ref>{{cite web|last1=Encyclopedia|first1=Britannica|title=Sikhism (religion)|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/543916/Sikhism/253170/The-rejection-of-caste|website=britannica.com|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Sikh diaspora===\n{{Further|Sikhism in India|Sikh diaspora|Sikhism by country}}\n[[File:Sikhs on the move!.jpg|thumb|Sikhs celebrating [[Vaisakhi]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada]]\nSikhism is [[Major religious groups#Religious demographics|the fifth-largest amongst the major world religions]], and one of the youngest.<ref name=\"Partridge2013\">{{cite book|author=Christopher Partridge|title=Introduction to World Religions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z3AjAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA429|date=1 November 2013|publisher=Fortress Press|isbn=978-0-8006-9970-3|pages=429\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"McDowellBrown2009\">{{cite book|author1=Michael McDowell|author2=Nathan Robert Brown|title=World Religions at Your Fingertips|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0_dHrRY3gIC&pg=PA232|year=2009|publisher=Alpha Books|isbn=978-1-59257-846-7|pages=232\u2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Teece2005\">{{cite book|author=Geoff Teece|title=Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJO1WIABhPQC&pg=PA4|year=2005|publisher=Black Rabbit Books|isbn=978-1-58340-469-0|pages=4\u2013}}</ref> Worldwide, there are 25.8&nbsp;million Sikhs, which makes up 0.39% of the world's population.

Today temples, newspapers, radio stations, and markets cater to these large, multi-generational [[Indo-Canadians|Indo-Canadian]] groups. Sikh festivals such as Vaisakhi and [[Bandi Chhor Divas|Bandi Chhor]] are celebrated in those Canadian cities by the largest groups of followers in the world outside the Punjab.\n\nSikhs also migrated to East Africa, West Africa, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia. These communities developed as Sikhs migrated out of Punjab to fill in gaps in imperial labour markets.<ref>{{cite book | last=Ballantyne|first=Tony|year=2006|title=Between Colonialism and Diaspora: Sikh Cultural Formations in an Imperial World|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn = 978-0-8223-3824-6|pages=69\u201374}}</ref> In the early twentieth century a significant community began to take shape on the west coast of the United States.
