{"title_page": "Incidents at European amusement parks", "text_new": "This is a summary of notable incidents that have taken place at various European [[amusement parks]], [[water parks]], or [[theme parks]]. This list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of every such event, but only those that have a significant impact on the parks or park owners, or are otherwise significantly newsworthy.\n\nThe term ''incidents'' refers to major accidents, injuries, deaths that occur at a European park. While these incidents were required to be reported to regulatory authorities due to where they occurred, they usually fall into one of the following categories:\n*Caused by negligence on the part of the guest. This can be refusal to follow specific ride safety instructions, or deliberate intent to break park rules.\n*The result of a guest's known, or unknown, health issues.\n*Negligence on the part of the park, either by ride operator or maintenance.\n*[[Act of God]] or a generic accident (e.g., slipping and falling), that is not a direct result of an action on anybody's part.\n\n==Alton Towers==\n{{Main|Alton Towers}}\n\n=== Oblivion ===\n* On 8 May 2012, a 20-year-old man entered a restricted area of the ride and walked into the tunnel.

The fire broke out on the powered roller coaster Grand Canyon Achterbahn, which was located inside the structure of the bigger roller coaster Gebirgsbahn on a day when the park was filled with 20,000 visitors. The park's founder said a cable fire was most likely the cause of the blaze. There were 150 passengers on the two rides when the fire broke out. Some passengers of the Gebirgsbahn were only able to exit the cars using a {{convert|60|foot|m}} ladder. The mostly polystyrene facade was coated with a fire-resistant film; however, it had lost its effect after years of operation and caught fire. The two roller coasters and the nearby Tanagra Theater were completely destroyed and demolished shortly after. Following this accident, the park improved the safety standards on many of its attractions. This resulted in some compromises. Some of the effects on the park's rides had to be removed, the upper floor of the IMAX simulator Galaxy (later: Race for Atlantis) was permanently closed and the track of the Gondelbahn 1001-Nacht dark ride was shortened to make room for a rescue passage for firetrucks. The park also installed new sprinkler systems in some of the rides like the Silbermine dark ride. Today the rapid river River Quest is located on the site of the two roller coasters.

The fire broke out on the powered roller coaster Grand Canyon Achterbahn, which was located inside the structure of the bigger roller coaster Gebirgsbahn on a day when the park was filled with 20,000 visitors. The park's founder said a cable fire was most likely the cause of the blaze. There were 150 passengers on the two rides when the fire broke out. Some passengers of the Gebirgsbahn were only able to exit the cars using a {{convert|60|foot|m}} ladder. The mostly polystyrene facade was coated with a fire-resistant film; however, it had lost its effect after years of operation and caught fire. The two roller coasters and the nearby Tanagra Theater were completely destroyed and demolished shortly after. Following this accident, the park improved the safety standards on many of its attractions. This resulted in some compromises. Some of the effects on the park's rides had to be removed, the upper floor of the IMAX simulator Galaxy (later: Race for Atlantis) was permanently closed and the track of the Gondelbahn 1001-Nacht dark ride was shortened to make room for a rescue passage for firetrucks. The park also installed new sprinkler systems in some of the rides like the Silbermine dark ride. Today the rapid river River Quest is located on the site of the two roller coasters. The Tanagra Theater was replaced with the Vekoma Mad House Feng Ju Palace.<ref>{{cite news\n |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/05/01/germany.roller/index.html \n |title=Rollercoaster fire injures 54 \n |publisher=CNN \n |date=2001-05-01 \n |accessdate=2009-09-23 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627055746/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/05/01/germany.roller/index.html \n |archivedate=June 27, 2009 \n}}</ref>\n\n===Black Mamba===\n* On 14 May 2011, a 48-year-old man died while riding [[Black Mamba (roller coaster)|Black Mamba]], an inverted roller coaster.

It is alleged that the boy stood up too early as the boat reached the end point. Another boat collided with the boy's boat, knocking him into the water. Two people dived in after the boy, but he'd disappeared in the artificial waves of the attraction. When he was found 20 minutes later, resuscitation efforts were of no avail.<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=https://www.expatica.com/be/news/country-news/Belgian-boy-drowns-in-Parc-Asterix-attraction_138741.html\n|title=Belgian boy drowns in Parc Asterix attraction\n|publisher=Expatica\n|date=2006-07-06\n|accessdate=2018-06-24\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=http://www.attractionland.com/fr/parc-asterix/news/article-89-2006070789-Accident-au-Parc-Asterix.html\n|title=Accident au Parc Asterix (French)\n|publisher=AttractionLand\n|date=2006-06-05\n|accessdate=2009-09-22\n}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite news\n |url        = http://66.196.80.202/babelfish/translate_url_content?.intl=us&lp=fr_en&trurl=http://www.attractionland.com/fr/parc-asterix/news/article-89-2006070789-Accident-au-Parc-Asterix.html\n |title      = Accident at Parc Asterix (English)\n |publisher  = AttractionLand\n |date       = 2006-06-05\n |accessdate = 2009-09-22\n}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=fr&u=http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/france/0,,3314289,00-petit-garcon-noie-parc-asterix-.html&ei=D0O5Sv2_KpO5jAfb6O35BQ&sa=X&oi=translate&resnum=5&ct=result&prev=/search%3Fq%3DParc%2BAst%25C3%25A9rix%2Baccident%26hl%3Den%26rls%3Dcom.microsoft:en-gb:IE-SearchBox%26rlz%3D1I7ACAW\n|title=Parc Asterix accident (English)\n|publisher=TFI.fr\n|date=2006-06-05\n|accessdate=2009-09-22\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/faits-divers/un-garcon-de-6-ans-se-noie-au-parc-asterix-06-07-2006-2007139911.php\n|title=Un Garcon de 6 ans se Noie Parc Asterix (French)\n|publisher=leparisien.fr\n|date=2006-06-07\n|accessdate=2009-09-22}}</ref>\n\n==PortAventura World==\n{{Main|PortAventura World}}\n\n===PortAventura Park===\n====Tomahawk====\n*On 18 May 2009, a 55-year-old park employee died after being run over by a roller coaster train as he was performing maintenance.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.thinkspain.com/news-spain/16608/portaventura-worker-killed-by-runaway-roller-coaster\n|title=PortAventura worker killed by runaway roller coaster\n|publisher=ThinkSpain\n|date=2009-05-18\n|accessdate=2009-09-23}}</ref>\n\n====Silver River Flume====\n*On 14 September 2018, a 19-year-old boy was injured after falling while waiting in line to ride the log flume.

It was renamed to Expo in 1999 and was named after [[Singapore Expo]]. Initially,  the station had two exits.\n\nTrain services to Expo station were initially operated as a 2-station shuttle service from [[Tanah Merah MRT station|Tanah Merah]] when the station first opened and it was first denoted by code E13 for a short while until the MRT map was revamped in 2001 by former cabinet minister [[Yeo Cheow Tong]] (who was then [[Minister for Transport (Singapore)|Transport Minister]]). It was then converted to a through service from [[Boon Lay station]] when the other station on the Changi Extension, [[Changi Airport MRT station|Changi Airport]], opened. However, to cut costs due to ridership falling below expectations, the service was reverted into shuttle mode on 22 July 2003.\n\nThe initial numbering of this station was EW28, until 20 June that year when it was changed to CG1. The same numbering is now used for [[Pioneer MRT station|Pioneer station]].\n\nThe station has high passenger traffic whenever there are major events occurring in the [[Singapore Expo]]. The recent expansion of [[Singapore Expo]] helped increase the passenger traffic in the station. However, traffic is still rather low at certain times of the year when there are not many events held. However, this changed in the 4th quarter of 2011 when a new shopping mall called [[Changi City Point]] opened south of the station and was linked to the station by an underpass, bringing more crowds to the station. A business hotel, [http://www.parkavenuechangi.com/ Park Avenue Changi], is located next to the station.\n\nAs with most of the above-ground stations built in the past along the [[East West MRT line|East West line]], it was built without [[platform screen doors]] that prevent commuters from falling onto the train tracks. Installation of the half-height screen doors started on 20 June 2011 as the last station of the East West line. On 31 August that year, all of the screen doors have been installed and began operating, marking the completion of the installation of all the Platform Screen Doors along the East West line.<ref>{{cite news | title = Elevated MRT stations on East-West line fitted with screen doors | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 31 August 2011 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1150215/1/.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/324989/1/.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730183552/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/324989/1/.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 July 2012 |title=Above-ground MRT stations to have platform screen doors by 2012 |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |date=26 January 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2012 |author=Wong, Siew Ying }}</ref>\n\nOn 28 November 2011, LTA marked the start of construction of Downtown line 3 (DTL3) with a groundbreaking ceremony at this station.<ref>{{cite news | title = Construction Work on Downtown Line 3 Starts | url = http://app.lta.gov.sg/corp_press_content.asp?start=4a747klu0vn271gdz7uz5e25yp924iufxvbjqqj8wvim7s309o | publisher = Land Transport Authority | date = 28 November 2011 | accessdate = 16 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> On 31 May 2017, LTA announced that the station, together with the rest of DTL3, will be opened on 21 October that year.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=5c4e424c-1a46-44cb-92d0-212e37a2b6df | title = Factsheet: Downtown Line 3 to Open on 21 October 2017 | publisher = Land Transport Authority | date = 31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nTo facilitate the construction for the Downtown line 3 Expo station and its tunnels, part of Changi South Avenue 1 towards Somapah Road and Changi South Avenue 2, together with a short section of Expo Drive were temporarily closed to traffic from 2 October 2011 to May 2017. The Expo Drive was also reopened at the same time. The original underpass as seen in Changi South Avenue 1 has been converted from the public underpass to paid link underpass for connection to Downtown line whereas the public link is still available at Expo MRT station with a barricade that is only locked when train services are not running.

Initially,  the station had two exits.\n\nTrain services to Expo station were initially operated as a 2-station shuttle service from [[Tanah Merah MRT station|Tanah Merah]] when the station first opened and it was first denoted by code E13 for a short while until the MRT map was revamped in 2001 by former cabinet minister [[Yeo Cheow Tong]] (who was then [[Minister for Transport (Singapore)|Transport Minister]]). It was then converted to a through service from [[Boon Lay station]] when the other station on the Changi Extension, [[Changi Airport MRT station|Changi Airport]], opened. However, to cut costs due to ridership falling below expectations, the service was reverted into shuttle mode on 22 July 2003.\n\nThe initial numbering of this station was EW28, until 20 June that year when it was changed to CG1. The same numbering is now used for [[Pioneer MRT station|Pioneer station]].\n\nThe station has high passenger traffic whenever there are major events occurring in the [[Singapore Expo]]. The recent expansion of [[Singapore Expo]] helped increase the passenger traffic in the station. However, traffic is still rather low at certain times of the year when there are not many events held. However, this changed in the 4th quarter of 2011 when a new shopping mall called [[Changi City Point]] opened south of the station and was linked to the station by an underpass, bringing more crowds to the station. A business hotel, [http://www.parkavenuechangi.com/ Park Avenue Changi], is located next to the station.\n\nAs with most of the above-ground stations built in the past along the [[East West MRT line|East West line]], it was built without [[platform screen doors]] that prevent commuters from falling onto the train tracks. Installation of the half-height screen doors started on 20 June 2011 as the last station of the East West line. On 31 August that year, all of the screen doors have been installed and began operating, marking the completion of the installation of all the Platform Screen Doors along the East West line.<ref>{{cite news | title = Elevated MRT stations on East-West line fitted with screen doors | publisher = Channel NewsAsia | date = 31 August 2011 | url = http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1150215/1/.html }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/324989/1/.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730183552/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/324989/1/.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 July 2012 |title=Above-ground MRT stations to have platform screen doors by 2012 |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |date=26 January 2008 |accessdate=1 February 2012 |author=Wong, Siew Ying }}</ref>\n\nOn 28 November 2011, LTA marked the start of construction of Downtown line 3 (DTL3) with a groundbreaking ceremony at this station.<ref>{{cite news | title = Construction Work on Downtown Line 3 Starts | url = http://app.lta.gov.sg/corp_press_content.asp?start=4a747klu0vn271gdz7uz5e25yp924iufxvbjqqj8wvim7s309o | publisher = Land Transport Authority | date = 28 November 2011 | accessdate = 16 July 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> On 31 May 2017, LTA announced that the station, together with the rest of DTL3, will be opened on 21 October that year.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=2&id=5c4e424c-1a46-44cb-92d0-212e37a2b6df | title = Factsheet: Downtown Line 3 to Open on 21 October 2017 | publisher = Land Transport Authority | date = 31 May 2017}}</ref>\n\nTo facilitate the construction for the Downtown line 3 Expo station and its tunnels, part of Changi South Avenue 1 towards Somapah Road and Changi South Avenue 2, together with a short section of Expo Drive were temporarily closed to traffic from 2 October 2011 to May 2017. The Expo Drive was also reopened at the same time. The original underpass as seen in Changi South Avenue 1 has been converted from the public underpass to paid link underpass for connection to Downtown line whereas the public link is still available at Expo MRT station with a barricade that is only locked when train services are not running. The station has increased the number of exits from 2 to 7 due to high traffic footfall of Changi Business Park.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.lta.gov.sg/apps/news/page.aspx?c=1&id=120dbc38-4f82-4272-825b-eb6314ebd2f6 | title = Factsheet: PARTIAL CLOSURE OF CHANGI SOUTH AVENUE 1 & REALIGNMENT OF FOOTHPATH | publisher = Land Transport Authority | date = 29 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the same time, TITAN faregates were being installed at Expo MRT station on 13 July that year, replacing second generation ST Electronics faregates.\n\nOn 25 May 2019, the [[Land Transport Authority]] announced an extension of the [[Thomson\u2013East Coast MRT line|Thomson\u2013East Coast line]] (TEL) to Changi Airport.

[[Pleural effusion|Excess fluid in the pleural cavity]] and [[empyema|gathering of pus within a cavity]] are more common for melioidosis affecting lower lobes of the lungs. Therefore, melioidosis should be differentiated from [[tuberculosis]] as both conditions show radiogical changes on the upper lobes of the lungs.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> In 10% of cases, people develop secondary pneumonia caused by other bacteria after the primary infection.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\nDepending on the course of infection, other severe manifestations can develop. 1% to 5% of those infected develop [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and brain covering]] or [[brain abscess|collection of pus in the brain]]; 14 to 28% develop [[acute pyelonephritis|bacterial inflammation of the kidneys]], kidney abscess or prostatic abscesses; 0 to 30% develop neck or [[parotid gland|salivary gland]] abscesses; 10 to 33% develop liver, spleen, or paraintestinal abscesses; 4 to 14% develop [[septic arthritis]] and [[osteomyelitis]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  Other rare manifestations include [[lymphadenopathy|lymph node disease]] resembling tuberculosis, [[mediastinum|mediastinal]] masses, [[pericardial effusion|collection of fluid in the heart covering]],<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> [[mycotic aneurysm|abnormal dilatation of blood vessels due to infection]],<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> and [[pancreatitis|inflammation of the pancreas]].<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> In Australia, up to 20% of infected males develop prostatic abscess characterized by [[dysuria|pain during urination]], difficulty in passing urine, and [[urinary retention]] requiring [[catheter]]ization.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Rectal examination]] can show inflammation of the [[prostate]].<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> In Thailand, 30% of the infected children develop parotid abscesses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Infections of the eye, such as sub[[conjunctiva]]l abscess and orbital [[cellulitis]] may also occur.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> Encephalomyelitis can occur in healthy people without risk factors. Those with melioidosis encephomyelitis tend to have normal [[computed tomography]] (CT) scans but increased [[T2*-weighted imaging|T2 signal]] by [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), extending to the [[brain stem]] and [[spinal cord]]. Clinical signs include: unilateral [[upper motor neuron]] limb weakness, [[focal neurological signs|cerebellar signs]], and cranial nerve palsies ([[Sixth nerve palsy|VI]], [[Facial nerve paralysis|VII]] nerve palsies and [[bulbar palsy]]).

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation.

He was the founder and chairman of the anti-[[Female genital mutilation|FGM]] organization [[TARGET (NGO)|TARGET]], and chairman of the organizations [[Friends of Peoples Close to Nature]] (German section \u2013 ''{{lang|de|Freunde der Naturv\u00f6lker}})'' and ''{{lang|de|Rettet den Regenwald}}'' (Save the Rainforest).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.survivalinternational.org/news/1537 |title=NGOs appeal to German president over Bushmen |publisher=Survival International |date=2009-04-10 |accessdate=2009-11-29}}</ref> He  lived in [[Rausdorf]] near [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. Nehberg described himself as having \"No astrological sign, no church, no hair, and no clip in the ear (the latter means: he is a [[wiktionary:maverick|maverick]])\".\n\n==Life and work==\nNehberg was born in [[Bielefeld]]. After school, Nehberg initially became a [[pastry chef]] by trade, but increasingly turned his attention to outdoor [[wiktionary:survival|survival]]. In 1972, together with two friends, he became one of the first to travel the length of the [[Blue Nile]] in a home-made boat.\n\nSince 1980, he has been involved in defending the interests of the [[Yanomami]] [[Amerindian]] [[tribe]]. With his enterprise, \"The Tree\"<ref>[http://www.museumspeyer.de/000040FE6A14_D9A05548_00000F9B_0001.html The Tree] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331125015/http://www.museumspeyer.de/000040FE6A14_D9A05548_00000F9B_0001.html |date=2007-03-31 }}, Technikmuseum Speyer</ref> (crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on a [[fir|fir-tree]] in 2000), he contributed to the provision of a protected reservation for the Yanomami. In 1981 &ndash; followed by a camera team &ndash; he crisscrossed [[Germany]] without any special equipment and relying for his sustenance solely on what he was able to find in nature. In 1987, Nehberg crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in a [[pedalo|pedal boat]].\n\nHe was also one of the first to discredit the fraudulent \"[[Tatunca Nara]]\" story, which had gained publicity in the German and Brazilian media. A German worker named Hans G\u00fcnther Hauck left his home near Nuremberg in 1967, moved into the Brazilian jungle, and proclaimed himself the leader of the secret Ugha-Mongulala tribe, which had lived hidden in the secret jungle city of [[Akakor]] for 15,000 years. Neither the city nor the tribe ever existed. Nevertheless, many filmmakers and adventure-loving men and women believed Nara, and three people even died during Tatunca-led jungle excursions. The circumstances that led to their deaths have never been fully revealed. In Nehberg's book ''Der selbstgemachte H\u00e4uptling'' (''The Self-Made Chieftain''), the whole story of this mysterious man and his deeds can be read.\n\nIn September 2000, he founded the [[human rights]] organization TARGET to prevent the practice of [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM). For his commitment to endangered peoples, Nehberg was awarded the ''[[Bundesverdienstkreuz]]'' (\"Federal Cross for Merit\").

Nehberg described himself as having \"No astrological sign, no church, no hair, and no clip in the ear (the latter means: he is a [[wiktionary:maverick|maverick]])\".\n\n==Career==\nNehberg was born in [[Bielefeld]]. After school, Nehberg initially became a [[pastry chef]] by trade, but increasingly turned his attention to outdoor [[wiktionary:survival|survival]]. In 1972, together with two friends, he became one of the first to travel the length of the [[Blue Nile]] in a home-made boat.\n\nSince 1980, he has been involved in defending the interests of the [[Yanomami]] [[Amerindian]] [[tribe]]. With his enterprise, \"The Tree\"<ref>[http://www.museumspeyer.de/000040FE6A14_D9A05548_00000F9B_0001.html The Tree] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070331125015/http://www.museumspeyer.de/000040FE6A14_D9A05548_00000F9B_0001.html |date=2007-03-31 }}, Technikmuseum Speyer</ref> (crossing the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on a [[fir|fir-tree]] in 2000), he contributed to the provision of a protected reservation for the Yanomami. In 1981 &ndash; followed by a camera team &ndash; he crisscrossed [[Germany]] without any special equipment and relying for his sustenance solely on what he was able to find in nature. In 1987, Nehberg crossed the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in a [[pedalo|pedal boat]].\n\nHe was also one of the first to discredit the fraudulent \"[[Tatunca Nara]]\" story, which had gained publicity in the German and Brazilian media. A German worker named Hans G\u00fcnther Hauck left his home near Nuremberg in 1967, moved into the Brazilian jungle, and proclaimed himself the leader of the secret Ugha-Mongulala tribe, which had lived hidden in the secret jungle city of [[Akakor]] for 15,000 years. Neither the city nor the tribe ever existed. Nevertheless, many filmmakers and adventure-loving men and women believed Nara, and three people even died during Tatunca-led jungle excursions. The circumstances that led to their deaths have never been fully revealed. In Nehberg's book ''Der selbstgemachte H\u00e4uptling'' (''The Self-Made Chieftain''), the whole story of this mysterious man and his deeds can be read.\n\nIn September 2000, he founded the [[human rights]] organization TARGET to prevent the practice of [[female genital mutilation]] (FGM). For his commitment to endangered peoples, Nehberg was awarded the ''[[Bundesverdienstkreuz]]'' (\"Federal Cross for Merit\"). In November 2006, TARGET organized and financed a conference under the patronage of the Egyptian [[Mufti|Great Mufti]] [[Ali Gomaa]] at [[Al-Azhar University]] of [[Cairo (Egypt)|Cairo]].
