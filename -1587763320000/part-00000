{"title_page": "Dante Tessieri", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced|date=August 2012}}\n{{notability|date=August 2012}}\n}}\n\n'''Dante Tessieri''' was an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[scientist]] born in the late nineteenth century.\nBetween many of the today unknown geniuses on history, we can not avoid watching Dante, a man who excelled on the fields of [[physics]], [[electricity]] and [[mathematics]]. Being him one of the first scientist to actually disagree with [[Albert Einstein]]'s ''[[general relativity]] theory'', doing so by publishing a book called \"''La Relatividad General ante la prueba Suprema''\".(Such book could be is found today in the Argentine National Congress Library [http://consulta.bcn.gov.ar/bcn/Catalogo.Buscar?d=T&q=La+relatividad+general+ante+la+prueba+suprema&lg=EN]). In this book, Dante Tessieri calls himself \"[[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]\", using it as an alias, with the course of the book Dante refers to Einstein with apathy as he tends to correct Einstein's relativity theory with valid references.\n\n== His Life ==\nAs of today, not much of his life is known. He was born between 1850 and 1875 and died between 1920 and 1935, as a young [[physicist]], he was able to make many discoveries which led him to the attempt of proving the general relativity theory wrong.

He was the nephew of [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], and was the last president of the LDS Church to have known him personally.\n\n==Biography==\nSmith was the son of [[Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|church patriarch]] [[Hyrum Smith]] and his second wife, [[Mary Fielding Smith|Mary Fielding]], a British convert to the church who married Hyrum after the death of his first wife, Jerusha Barden Smith (1805\u20131837). In addition to her two children, Mary also raised the six children born to Hyrum and Jerusha.\n\n===Early life===\nSmith was born in [[Far West, Missouri]], on November 13, 1838. Just a few days before he was born, his father had been taken prisoner under the auspices of the [[Missouri Executive Order 44]] (infamously called the \"extermination order\" due to its threat against the lives of Mormons who refused to leave the state after clashes between them and a Missouri militia). At point of [[bayonet]], Hyrum was marched to his home in Far West and ordered to say farewell to his wife. He was told that his \"doom was sealed\" and that he would never see her again. Hyrum was still in custody in [[Liberty Jail]], Missouri, when Smith was born. He was named after his uncle, Joseph Smith, and his mother's brother, [[Joseph Fielding]]. His mother and maternal aunt, [[Mercy Fielding Thompson]], fled with their children to [[Quincy, Illinois]], early in 1839, and they later moved to [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], when the majority of the church's members settled. Hyrum was later released from custody during a transfer from Liberty Jail and joined his family in Nauvoo. Joseph F. Smith stated as an adult that he had memories of Nauvoo, and could recall his Uncle Joseph and events that occurred at his uncle's home; he was nearly six years old when his father and uncle [[Death of Joseph Smith|were killed]] in [[Carthage, Illinois]], on June 27, 1844.\n\n===Winter Quarters===\nSmith's family remained in Nauvoo until September 1846, at which time his mother took their family and fled the city, camping on the west side of the [[Mississippi River]] among the trees on its banks, without wagon or tent, while the city was bombarded by mobs. His mother was later able to exchange their property in Illinois for a wagon and team of oxen. Smith and his family, along with many other Latter Day Saints, fled the American Midwest. The seven-year-old Smith drove the team of oxen with his family to the Latter Day Saint encampment at [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska]].\n\nWhile at Winter Quarters, Smith and another boy, Thomas Burdick, were out on horseback some distance from the settlement, watching the cattle graze. They saw a band of twenty or thirty American Indians ride into the valley on the other side of the cattle. Burdick rode back to camp to get help while Smith rode toward the Indians and got between the Indians and the herd before the Indians reached them. Smith was able to turn the herd back toward the settlement, and, coupled with the noise and arrival of the Indians, started a stampede which saved the herd from capture. He was still riding with the herd at full speed when two Indians picked him up off of his horse from either side and dropped him to the ground. A company of men from the encampment then arrived, chased away the fleeing Indians, and recovered the herd, but Smith's horse was stolen.\n\nSmith and his family remained at Winter Quarters until the spring of 1848 when Smith drove his mother's wagon across the plains to the [[Salt Lake Valley]].\n\n===Utah childhood===\nAfter arriving in the Salt Lake Valley in 1848, Smith's mother worked to raise her own children as well as the children of her husband's first wife. Mary Fielding Smith died in 1852, apparently of [[pneumonia]], leaving Smith an orphan at the age of 13. Smith reported that he was devastated by his mother's death, and relied upon the emotional support and help of [[Brigham Young]] and his stepfather, [[Heber C. Kimball]]. Even with the support of his older half-brother [[John Smith (nephew of Joseph Smith)|John Smith]], Smith assumed primary responsibility for his young sister, Martha Ann, and subsequently left school in 1854. His leaving school was closely linked to his resistance of a teacher's attempt to whip Martha.<ref>Smith. ''Life of Joseph F. Smith'', p. 229.</ref>\n\n===Missions and military service===\nAt the age of fifteen, Smith was called to go on his first LDS [[Mission (LDS Church)|mission]] to the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] under the direction of [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Parley P. Pratt]]. This mission assignment at an unusually young age happened after Smith assaulted a teacher who he felt was unfairly punishing another student; decades later Smith wrote in the LDS publication ''Improvement Era'' of the burning rage and explosive temper of his youth which he blamed in part on his reaction to the deaths of his parents.<ref>Scott G Kenny [https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/120-20-43.pdf Before the Beard: The Trials of Young Joseph F. Smith], Sunstine Magazine Nov 2001</ref> Smith was ordained an [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]] by [[George A. Smith]] on April 24, 1854, and received his [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] at the [[Endowment House]] the same day. He then traveled to [[San Bernardino, California]], where he worked to earn money for passage on a ship to San Francisco. In the San Francisco area, possibly in what is now [[Fremont, California]], on the farm of [[John M. Horner|John Horner]], he was again employed in agricultural pursuits seeking to earn money for passage to Hawaii.<ref>Smith. ''Life of Joseph F. Smith'', pp. 164\u201367.</ref><ref>[[Richard O. Cowan]] and William E. Homer. ''California Saints: A 150-Year Legacy in the Golden State'' (Provo: Religious Studies Center of Brigham Young University, 1996), pp. 144\u201347.</ref>\n\nAfter a difficult period of adjustment to the local culture,<ref>Kenny, 2001</ref> Smith successfully learned the [[Hawaiian language]] and reported great success in four years of missionary work on the islands. Besides serving with various American companions on his mission, he also had two Hawaiian companions: Paake, who was a property manager for some of [[Jonathan Napela]]'s property, and Lalawaia. He spent the first part of his mission on [[Maui]], but later presided over groups of branches on the [[island of Hawaii]] and then over all LDS Church units on [[Molokai]].<ref>Smith. ''Joseph F. Smith'', pp. 169\u201387.</ref>\n\nSmith was called back to [[Utah Territory]] in 1857, largely as a result of the [[Utah War]]. He traveled overland from San Francisco to San Bernardino and then north through Las Vegas on his return.  He arrived in Utah in February 1858. Shortly after this, Smith joined the territory's militia, named the [[Nauvoo Legion]], and spent several months patrolling the eastern side of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Later in his tour of duty, he served as chaplain of Colonel Heber C. Kimball's [[regiment]], with the rank of [[Captain (land)|captain]]. After tensions between the church and the federal government abated, Smith assisted his relatives in their return to northern Utah from areas of southern Utah, where they had taken their families for safety.\n\nDuring the 1858\u201359 session of the Utah territorial legislature, Smith served as the [[sergeant-at-arms]]. In 1859, he married his first wife, Levira Smith. In the LDS Church, Smith was ordained a [[Seventy (LDS Church)|seventy]] in March 1858 and then a [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]] and a member of the Salt Lake [[Stake (LDS Church)|Stake]] [[high council (LDS Church)|high council]] in October 1858.<ref>Smith. ''Joseph F. Smith'', p. 196.</ref>\n\nIn 1860, at 22 years of age, Smith was sent on a mission to [[Great Britain]]. He and his cousin, Samuel H. B. Smith, drove mule teams over the plains to Winter Quarters to help pay their way. Shortly after arriving in England, Smith was made the [[District (LDS Church)|conference]] president in Sheffield. Among the church members in that city was [[William Fowler (Mormon)|William Fowler]]; Smith was present at the meeting where Fowler's hymn \"[[We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet]]\" was first sung.<ref>Smith. ''Joseph F. Smith'', p. 199.</ref> After a short time, Smith was appointed to the pastorate, an office that existed only in the British [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]] for a short time. In this position, he presided over the Sheffield Conference as well as four other adjacent conferences. He served in the British Mission for three years, the last part under [[mission president]] [[George Q. Cannon]], when he was sent on short assignments to [[Denmark]] and [[France]].  Smith left England in June 1863. After a short stay in New York City to earn enough money to return home, he served as the chaplain of a Mormon pioneer wagon company bound for Utah from Nebraska.<ref>Smith. ''Joseph F. Smith'', pp. 202\u201305.</ref>\n\nSmith had only been home for a short while when he was called to accompany [[Ezra T. Benson]], [[Lorenzo Snow]], [[William W. Cluff]], and Alma T. Smith on a mission to the Sandwich Islands to correct the problems in the church caused by [[Walter M. Gibson]]. Gibson misrepresented his blessing from [[Brigham Young]] as an appointment to be a leader in the church, and then established a separate church with a quorum of the 12, calling himself a prophet, and charging people to receive the priesthood. Smith acted as principal interpreter for the apostles, and after Gibson was excommunicated, Smith was left in charge of the mission. Smith returned home in the winter of 1864\u201365. Prior to leaving Hawai'i Smith and [[William W. Cluff]] located a new gathering place for the Saints in [[Laie, Hawaii]].<ref>Matthew J. Grow, et al, ''Saints'' Vol 2, (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2020) p. 333</ref>\n\nSmith had a notable experience during this mission. The group anchored their boat in a rough channel in order to go ashore, proposing that the party should land using the freight boat. Smith was strongly opposed to this, saying that the boat was unfit for the rough waters and that there was a great danger of capsizing. He offered to go ashore alone to obtain a boat fit to transport the party, to which they refused. They were persistent, however, chiding him for his waywardness, with one leader even saying, \"Young man, you would be better to obey counsel.\" Smith then reiterated his impression of danger, imploring them not to go, but they insisted, so he asked that they leave their satchels, clothes, and valuables and permit him to stay. They reluctantly consented and set out for land. Partway there, the freight boat was overturned by the rough water about 20 or 30 feet deep, and [[Lorenzo Snow]] nearly drowned in the ocean. Snow's unconscious body was recovered, and on shore they were able to resuscitate him. Thanks to Smith's actions, all of their belongings were saved.\n\n===Clerical and political career===\nUpon his return home, Smith was employed in the [[Church Historian and Recorder|Church Historian's]] office for a number of years. It was while working in this position he met his second wife, [[Julina Lambson Smith|Julina Lambson]], who was a niece of [[Bathsheba W. Smith]], a wife of church apostle [[George A. Smith]].\n\nSmith also served as a clerk in the [[Endowment House]] from the death of Brigham Young until the building was razed in 1890. Smith's latter mission to Hawaii was largely prompted by the fact that Smith held this position: since he had in his possession the records of the Endowment House, Smith could be a valuable witness for the federal government's prosecutions of Mormon polygamists.\n\nSmith served seven terms in the Utah territorial House of Representatives, specifically from 1865 to 1870, 1872, and 1874. He was a member of the Salt Lake City Council for many years and in this position was a key advocate of establishing city parks. He was thus one of the people involved with the establishment of Pioneer Park and Liberty Park in Salt Lake City.<ref name=smith230>Smith. ''Life of Joseph F. Smith'', p. 230.</ref> In 1868 and 1869, Smith served as a member of the [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] City Council.<ref name=smith230/> Smith served as a member of the Utah Territorial Council, essentially the equivalent of the upper house of the legislature, in 1880 and 1882. He also served as president of the Utah constitutional convention in 1882. The state constitution produced by this convention did not go into effect because Congress did not vote to grant Utah statehood until 1895.\n\nSmith also served as a LDS Church representative on boards of many Utah businesses.\n\n==Marriages and family==\nOn April 5, 1859, Smith married his sixteen-year-old cousin, Levira Annette Clark Smith, daughter of [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel H. Smith]]. When Joseph F. Smith left on his mission to England the next year, his companion for the journey was Levira's brother, Samuel. Smith and Levira had no children. Seven years later (1866), Brigham Young directed Smith to take a [[Plural marriage|plural wife]]. Levira gave her permission and was present at the marriage of Smith and [[Julina Lambson]] (who became the mother of future president Joseph Fielding Smith) -- a longtime friend of hers. Levira became disenchanted with the plural marriage arrangement and in 1867 they agreed to separate.  Levira moved to California and divorced him.<ref>https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/120-20-43.pdf</ref><ref>Smith. ''Joseph F. Smith'', p. 231.</ref>\n{{clear}}\nSmith ultimately adopted five children and fathered forty-five children. Thirteen of his biological children preceded him in death: Mercy, Leonora, Sarah Ellen, Heber, Rhoda, Alice, Hyrum, Alfred, Albert, Robert, Zina, Ruth, and John.

Smith Family.jpg|thumb|center|upright=3.0|This turn of the century family portrait was taken close to the time Joseph F. Smith succeeded Lorenzo Snow as president of the LDS Church in October 1901. Besides Levira, with whom he had no children, Smith had five other wives and forty-eight children. His wives are (L to R seated by Smith): Mary Taylor Schwartz (married, 1884, seven children); Edna Lambson (married 1871, ten children); Julina Lambson (married 1866, thirteen children, including Joseph Fielding Smith\u2014top row, center); Sarah Ellen Richards (married 1868, eleven children); Alice Ann Kimball (married 1883, seven children); circa 1904]]\n\n==General authority==\n[[File:Joseph F. Smith in the Sacred Grove.jpg|175px|thumb|right|<center>Joseph F. Smith in the [[Sacred Grove (Latter Day Saints)|Sacred Grove]], ca. 1905</center>]]\n\nOn July 1, 1866, Smith became a [[general authority]] of the LDS Church when he was ordained an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] by Brigham Young and [[common consent (Latter Day Saints)|sustained]] as a counselor to the First Presidency, where he served until Young's death. However, he was not sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles until the church's October 1867 conference. On February 28, 1874, Smith left for his second mission to England, serving as [[mission president|president]] of the European [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]] from 1874 to 1875, returning home upon the death of First Presidency member George A. Smith. He was then called to preside over the Davis [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|Stake]] until he left again in the spring of 1877 for his third mission to England. When news arrived of the death of Young, Smith was released and returned home. The following year, Smith served an Eastern States Mission with [[Orson Pratt]], visiting noteworthy places in the history of the church in [[Missouri]], [[Ohio]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Illinois]]. During this trip they met with and interviewed [[David Whitmer]].\n\nIn October 1880, three years after Young's death, Smith was named second counselor in the First Presidency to church president [[John Taylor (Latter Day Saints)|John Taylor]], serving from 1880 to 1887. He later served as second counselor to [[Wilford Woodruff]] (1889\u201398), and as second counselor to Lorenzo Snow (1898\u20131901). Smith was appointed first counselor to Snow on the death of first counselor [[George Q. Cannon]], but, as Snow himself died only four days later, Smith never served in that position. He succeeded Snow as president of the LDS Church and [[Temple president|president]] of the [[Salt Lake Temple]]. He served as president of the temple until 1911, when he transferred the responsibility to [[Anthon H. Lund]].\n\nSmith also served as editor of the ''[[Improvement Era]]'' and ''[[Juvenile Instructor]]'', and general superintendent of the [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] and [[Young Men (organization)|Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association]].\n\nSmith felt it was important for Utah to become a state, and thereby eliminate the ongoing federal supervision of [[Utah Territory]]. Following the official discontinuance of new [[1890 Manifesto|plural marriages]] by Woodruff in 1890, and the dissolution of the Mormon [[People's Party (Utah)|People's Party]] in 1891, Smith championed the anti-polygamy [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in Utah.\n\n==LDS Church President==\nAfter the death of church president Lorenzo Snow, Smith was chosen by the apostles of the church as Snow's successor. Smith was [[Setting apart|set apart]] as [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]] on October 17, 1901, with Presiding Patriarch [[John Smith (nephew of Joseph Smith)|John Smith]] acting as voice.<ref name=\"Bates Lost Legacy\">{{cite book|last1=Bates|first1=Irene M.|last2=Smith | first2=E. Gary|title=Lost legacy: The Mormon office of presiding patriarch|date=1996|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Champaign, IL|isbn=0252021630|edition=1}}</ref> This action was ratified by a special conference and [[solemn assembly]] of the priesthood on November 10, 1901. He chose [[John R. Winder]] and [[Anthon H. Lund]] as his counselors. After Winder died, Lund became the first counselor and Smith's second cousin, [[John Henry Smith]], became the second counselor.\n\n===Polygamy issues===\nOne of the first issues Smith faced was the ongoing difficulties for the church due to the continuing practice of plural marriage. Smith supported apostle [[Reed Smoot]]'s candidacy for the [[U.S. Senate]], but Smoot's election was contested on the grounds that he was an officer in a church which continued to countenance polygamous marriages. The [[Smoot Hearings|Senate investigation]] again focused national attention on Mormon marriages and political influence. Additional attention was given to Smith because of his opposition to the election and re-election of Utah's senior U.S. Senator, non-Mormon [[Thomas Kearns]].<ref>O. N. Malmquist, The First 100 Years: A History of the Salt Lake Tribune, Utah State Historical Society, 1971.</ref> Following his appearance before a Senate panel in 1904, Smith took steps to prevent any surreptitious continuation of church plural marriages. On April 6, 1904, Smith issued the \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", and declared that any church officer who performed a plural marriage, as well as the offending couple, would be excommunicated. He clarified that the church's policy against new plural marriages applied worldwide, and not just in the United States. Two members of the Quorum of the Twelve, [[John W. Taylor (Mormon)|John W. Taylor]] and [[Matthias F. Cowley]], resigned in 1905 following these announcements. Smith, however, continued to live with his plural wives as did other Mormon polygamists. In 1906, Smith was brought to trial on a charge of unlawful [[cohabitation]] with four women in addition to his lawful wife; he pleaded guilty and was fined $300, the maximum penalty then permitted under the law.<ref>''Deseret Evening News'', November 23, 1906; ''Salt Lake Tribune'', November 24, 1906.</ref>\n\n===Other noteworthy actions===\nSmith gave more influence to the [[Presiding Patriarch]] of the church than had any president since Joseph Smith. The church's presiding patriarch, [[John Smith (nephew of Joseph Smith)|John Smith]], was his elder half-brother. During his presidency, Smith apparently pushed to change the order in which church leaders were sustained in general conferences. He intended to have the presiding patriarch sustained before even himself (as president of the church), consistent with his interpretation of [[Doctrine and Covenants]] Section 124 and early historical precedent.<ref name=\"Bates Lost Legacy\" /> This met with opposition from the other apostles, and the proposal was not realized.\n\nIn 1906, Smith went on a tour to Europe, becoming the first LDS Church president to travel outside of North America during his presidential tenure.\n\nIn 1908, Smith organized a committee to standardize and reform the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic Priesthood]] quorums. This committee standardized the age requirements for young men to be ordained to the office of [[Teacher (Latter Day Saints)|Teacher]] or [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|Priest]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hartley|first1=William|title=The Priesthood Reform Movement, 1908-1922|journal=Brigham Young University Studies|date=1973}}</ref>\n\nSmith's seventeen-year presidential administration made efforts toward improving the church's [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and politics in the United States|damaged relationships with the federal government]] and related issues dealing with the church's financial situation. The administration acquired historic sites, constructed numerous meetinghouses, and expanded the church system of educational academies and universities. He also oversaw a continued growth in church membership.\n\nDuring Smith's presidential tenure, the LDS Church constructed and dedicated the [[Joseph Smith Birthplace Memorial]] near [[South Royalton, Vermont]]. It was dedicated by Smith on December 23, 1905, the 100th anniversary of Joseph Smith's birth. Also during Smith's presidency, the [[Seagull Monument]] at [[Temple Square]] in Salt Lake City was dedicated on October 1, 1913. In 1913, Boy Scouting became the official youth activity program for the church's young men. During much of his presidential tenure, Smith oversaw the planning and construction of the [[Laie Hawaii Temple|Hawaiian Temple]] in [[Laie, Hawaii]], one of his part-time residences. Smith died at Salt Lake City on November 19, 1918 during the [[1918 flu pandemic|Influenza Epidemic of that year]], a year before the Hawaiian Temple was to be dedicated. Smith left a body of religious writings often used in discussing church doctrine and religious conduct.\n\n===Death===\nSmith died of [[pneumonia]] resulting from [[pleurisy]] in Salt Lake City on November 19, 1918,<ref>[http://images.archives.utah.gov/data/81448/2229752/2229752_0000939.jpg State of Utah Death Certificate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326225159/http://images.archives.utah.gov/data/81448/2229752/2229752_0000939.jpg |date=2009-03-26 }}.</ref> and was succeeded by [[Heber J. Grant]]. Due to the widespread [[Spanish flu|influenza]] pandemic of 1918\u201320, a graveside service was held, rather than a public funeral. Smith was interred in the Salt Lake City cemetery on November 22, 1918.\n\n[[Image:JosephFSmithGrave.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grave marker of Joseph F. Smith, and [[Julina Lambson Smith]], one of his wives]]\n\n==Doctrinal contributions==\nDuring his administration as President of the Church, Smith made significant official statements of Latter-day Saint doctrine:\n\n*\"The Origin of Man\": In November 1909, in the midst of public interest in theories of evolution, the First Presidency issued a statement that affirmed that God created man in his own image. The document also succinctly reiterates the Mormon doctrine of a twofold creation (spiritual followed by temporal), the premortal existence of man, and ends noting that man, as a child of God, is capable of [[exaltation (Mormonism)|evolving into a god]].\n*\"The Father and the Son\": On June 20, 1916, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles issued a statement examining the Mormon use of the term \"Father\" in scripture, clarifying times when the word refers to God the Father and when the word refers to Jesus Christ. The statement identified four different uses of the word \"Father.\" God the Father is the literal parent of the spirits of mankind and the earthly father of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is referred to as \"the Father\" when discussing his role as creator of the earth, when he acts as \"the Father\" of those who abide in his gospel, and when he acts with the authority of his Heavenly Father while on earth.\n*\"Vision of the Redemption of the Dead\": On October 3, 1918, Smith received a [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] on the nature of the [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)|spirit world]] and on Jesus Christ's role in ensuring that the gospel is taught to all men, living and dead. A written account of the revelation was submitted to the general authorities of the church on October 31, 1918, and was unanimously accepted. The revelation was initially published in December 1918, and was added to the [[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]], one of the church's scriptural [[standard works]], in April 1976; it has since been removed from the Pearl of Great Price and added to the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] as section 138. This revelation complemented an 1894 statement on the eternal nature of the family and appropriate temple work for the dead issued by Woodruff. Genealogy work by members of the LDS Church increased after both of these statements.\n\nFunded by Lorenzo N. Stohl, the sermons and writings of Smith were compiled by [[John A. Widtsoe]], [[Osborne J. P. Widtsoe]], [[Albert E. Bowen]], [[Franklin S. Harris]], and Joseph Quinney. In 1919, the Committee on Study for the Priesthood Quorums of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had this work published as the book ''Gospel Doctrine'', for use as instruction for [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] [[Quorum (Latter Day Saints)|quorums]] of the church.\n\nSmith's [[Teachings of Presidents of the Church|teachings as an apostle]] were the 2000\u201301 course of study in the LDS Church's Sunday [[Relief Society]] and Melchizedek priesthood classes.\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|1=1.

He was the nephew of [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], and was the last president of the LDS Church to have known him personally.\n\n==Biography==\nSmith was the son of [[Patriarch (Latter Day Saints)|church patriarch]] [[Hyrum Smith]] and his second wife, [[Mary Fielding Smith|Mary Fielding]], a British convert to the church who married Hyrum after the death of his first wife, Jerusha Barden Smith (1805\u20131837). In addition to her two children, Mary also raised the six children born to Hyrum and Jerusha.\n\n===Early life===\nSmith was born in [[Far West, Missouri]], on November 13, 1838. Just a few days before he was born, his father had been taken prisoner under the auspices of the [[Missouri Executive Order 44]] (infamously called the \"extermination order\" due to its threat against the lives of Mormons who refused to leave the state after clashes between them and a Missouri militia). At point of [[bayonet]], Hyrum was marched to his home in Far West and ordered to say farewell to his wife. He was told that his \"doom was sealed\" and that he would never see her again. Hyrum was still in custody in [[Liberty Jail]], Missouri, when Smith was born. He was named after his uncle, Joseph Smith, and his mother's brother, [[Joseph Fielding]]. His mother and maternal aunt, [[Mercy Fielding Thompson]], fled with their children to [[Quincy, Illinois]], early in 1839, and they later moved to [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], when the majority of the church's members settled. Hyrum was later released from custody during a transfer from Liberty Jail and joined his family in Nauvoo. Joseph F. Smith stated as an adult that he had memories of Nauvoo, and could recall his Uncle Joseph and events that occurred at his uncle's home; he was nearly six years old when his father and uncle [[Death of Joseph Smith|were killed]] in [[Carthage, Illinois]], on June 27, 1844.\n\n===Winter Quarters===\nSmith's family remained in Nauvoo until September 1846, at which time his mother took their family and fled the city, camping on the west side of the [[Mississippi River]] among the trees on its banks, without wagon or tent, while the city was bombarded by mobs. His mother was later able to exchange their property in Illinois for a wagon and team of oxen. Smith and his family, along with many other Latter Day Saints, fled the American Midwest. The seven-year-old Smith drove the team of oxen with his family to the Latter Day Saint encampment at [[Winter Quarters, Nebraska]].\n\nWhile at Winter Quarters, Smith and another boy, Thomas Burdick, were out on horseback some distance from the settlement, watching the cattle graze. They saw a band of twenty or thirty American Indians ride into the valley on the other side of the cattle. Burdick rode back to camp to get help while Smith rode toward the Indians and got between the Indians and the herd before the Indians reached them. Smith was able to turn the herd back toward the settlement, and, coupled with the noise and arrival of the Indians, started a stampede which saved the herd from capture. He was still riding with the herd at full speed when two Indians picked him up off of his horse from either side and dropped him to the ground. A company of men from the encampment then arrived, chased away the fleeing Indians, and recovered the herd, but Smith's horse was stolen.\n\nSmith and his family remained at Winter Quarters until the spring of 1848 when Smith drove his mother's wagon across the plains to the [[Salt Lake Valley]].\n\n===Utah childhood===\nAfter arriving in the Salt Lake Valley in 1848, Smith's mother worked to raise her own children as well as the children of her husband's first wife. Mary Fielding Smith died in 1852, apparently of [[pneumonia]], leaving Smith an orphan at the age of 13. Smith reported that he was devastated by his mother's death, and relied upon the emotional support and help of [[Brigham Young]] and his stepfather, [[Heber C. Kimball]]. Even with the support of his older half-brother [[John Smith (nephew of Joseph Smith)|John Smith]], Smith assumed primary responsibility for his young sister, Martha Ann, and subsequently left school in 1854. His leaving school was closely linked to his resistance of a teacher's attempt to whip Martha.<ref>Smith. ''Life of Joseph F. Smith'', p. 229.</ref>\n\n===Missions and military service===\nAt the age of fifteen, Smith was called to go on his first LDS [[Mission (LDS Church)|mission]] to the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] under the direction of [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[Parley P. Pratt]]. This mission assignment at an unusually young age happened after Smith assaulted a teacher who he felt was unfairly punishing another student; decades later Smith wrote in the LDS publication ''Improvement Era'' of the burning rage and explosive temper of his youth which he blamed in part on his reaction to the deaths of his parents.<ref>Scott G Kenny [https://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/120-20-43.pdf Before the Beard: The Trials of Young Joseph F. Smith], Sunstine Magazine Nov 2001</ref> Smith was ordained an [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]] by [[George A. Smith]] on April 24, 1854, and received his [[Endowment (Mormonism)|endowment]] at the [[Endowment House]] the same day. He then traveled to [[San Bernardino, California]], where he worked to earn money for passage on a ship to San Francisco. In the San Francisco area, possibly in what is now [[Fremont, California]], on the farm of [[John M. Horner|John Horner]], he was again employed in agricultural pursuits seeking to earn money for passage to Hawaii.<ref>Smith. ''Life of Joseph F. Smith'', pp. 164\u201367.</ref><ref>[[Richard O. Cowan]] and William E. Homer. ''California Saints: A 150-Year Legacy in the Golden State'' (Provo: Religious Studies Center of Brigham Young University, 1996), pp. 144\u201347.</ref>\n\nAfter a difficult period of adjustment to the local culture,<ref>Kenny, 2001</ref> Smith successfully learned the [[Hawaiian language]] and reported great success in four years of missionary work on the islands. Besides serving with various American companions on his mission, he also had two Hawaiian companions: Paake, who was a property manager for some of [[Jonathan Napela]]'s property, and Lalawaia. He spent the first part of his mission on [[Maui]], but later presided over groups of branches on the [[island of Hawaii]] and then over all LDS Church units on [[Molokai]].<ref>Smith. ''Joseph F. Smith'', pp. 169\u201387.</ref>\n\nSmith was called back to [[Utah Territory]] in 1857, largely as a result of the [[Utah War]]. He traveled overland from San Francisco to San Bernardino and then north through Las Vegas on his return.  He arrived in Utah in February 1858. Shortly after this, Smith joined the territory's militia, named the [[Nauvoo Legion]], and spent several months patrolling the eastern side of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Later in his tour of duty, he served as chaplain of Colonel Heber C. Kimball's [[regiment]], with the rank of [[Captain (land)|captain]]. After tensions between the church and the federal government abated, Smith assisted his relatives in their return to northern Utah from areas of southern Utah, where they had taken their families for safety.\n\nDuring the 1858\u201359 session of the Utah territorial legislature, Smith served as the [[sergeant-at-arms]]. In 1859, he married his first wife, Levira Smith. In the LDS Church, Smith was ordained a [[Seventy (LDS Church)|seventy]] in March 1858 and then a [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]] and a member of the Salt Lake [[Stake (LDS Church)|Stake]] [[high council (LDS Church)|high council]] in October 1858.<ref>Smith. ''Joseph F. Smith'', p. 196.</ref>\n\nIn 1860, at 22 years of age, Smith was sent on a mission to [[Great Britain]]. He and his cousin, Samuel H. B. Smith, drove mule teams over the plains to Winter Quarters to help pay their way. Shortly after arriving in England, Smith was made the [[District (LDS Church)|conference]] president in Sheffield. Among the church members in that city was [[William Fowler (Mormon)|William Fowler]]; Smith was present at the meeting where Fowler's hymn \"[[We Thank Thee, O God, for a Prophet]]\" was first sung.<ref>Smith. ''Joseph F. Smith'', p. 199.</ref> After a short time, Smith was appointed to the pastorate, an office that existed only in the British [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]] for a short time. In this position, he presided over the Sheffield Conference as well as four other adjacent conferences. He served in the British Mission for three years, the last part under [[mission president]] [[George Q. Cannon]], when he was sent on short assignments to [[Denmark]] and [[France]].  Smith left England in June 1863. After a short stay in New York City to earn enough money to return home, he served as the chaplain of a Mormon pioneer wagon company bound for Utah from Nebraska.<ref>Smith. ''Joseph F. Smith'', pp. 202\u201305.</ref>\n\nSmith had only been home for a short while when he was called to accompany [[Ezra T. Benson]], [[Lorenzo Snow]], [[William W. Cluff]], and Alma T. Smith on a mission to the Sandwich Islands to correct the problems in the church caused by [[Walter M. Gibson]]. Gibson misrepresented his blessing from [[Brigham Young]] as an appointment to be a leader in the church, and then established a separate church with a quorum of the 12, calling himself a prophet, and charging people to receive the priesthood. Smith acted as principal interpreter for the apostles, and after Gibson was excommunicated, Smith was left in charge of the mission. Smith returned home in the winter of 1864\u201365. Prior to leaving Hawai'i Smith and [[William W. Cluff]] located a new gathering place for the Saints in [[Laie, Hawaii]].<ref>Matthew J. Grow, et al, ''Saints'' Vol 2, (Salt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 2020) p. 333</ref>\n\nSmith had a notable experience during this mission. The group anchored their boat in a rough channel in order to go ashore, proposing that the party should land using the freight boat. Smith was strongly opposed to this, saying that the boat was unfit for the rough waters and that there was a great danger of capsizing. He offered to go ashore alone to obtain a boat fit to transport the party, to which they refused. They were persistent, however, chiding him for his waywardness, with one leader even saying, \"Young man, you would be better to obey counsel.\" Smith then reiterated his impression of danger, imploring them not to go, but they insisted, so he asked that they leave their satchels, clothes, and valuables and permit him to stay. They reluctantly consented and set out for land. Partway there, the freight boat was overturned by the rough water about 20 or 30 feet deep, and [[Lorenzo Snow]] nearly drowned in the ocean. Snow's unconscious body was recovered, and on shore they were able to resuscitate him. Thanks to Smith's actions, all of their belongings were saved.\n\n===Clerical and political career===\nUpon his return home, Smith was employed in the [[Church Historian and Recorder|Church Historian's]] office for a number of years. It was while working in this position he met his second wife, [[Julina Lambson Smith|Julina Lambson]], who was a niece of [[Bathsheba W. Smith]], a wife of church apostle [[George A. Smith]].\n\nSmith also served as a clerk in the [[Endowment House]] from the death of Brigham Young until the building was razed in 1890. Smith's latter mission to Hawaii was largely prompted by the fact that Smith held this position: since he had in his possession the records of the Endowment House, Smith could be a valuable witness for the federal government's prosecutions of Mormon polygamists.\n\nSmith served seven terms in the Utah territorial House of Representatives, specifically from 1865 to 1870, 1872, and 1874. He was a member of the Salt Lake City Council for many years and in this position was a key advocate of establishing city parks. He was thus one of the people involved with the establishment of Pioneer Park and Liberty Park in Salt Lake City.<ref name=smith230>Smith. ''Life of Joseph F. Smith'', p. 230.</ref> In 1868 and 1869, Smith served as a member of the [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] City Council.<ref name=smith230/> Smith served as a member of the Utah Territorial Council, essentially the equivalent of the upper house of the legislature, in 1880 and 1882. He also served as president of the Utah constitutional convention in 1882. The state constitution produced by this convention did not go into effect because Congress did not vote to grant Utah statehood until 1895.\n\nSmith also served as a LDS Church representative on boards of many Utah businesses.\n\n==Marriages and family==\nOn April 5, 1859, Smith married his sixteen-year-old cousin, Levira Annette Clark Smith, daughter of [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel H. Smith]]. When Joseph F. Smith left on his mission to England the next year, his companion for the journey was Levira's brother, Samuel. Smith and Levira had no children. Seven years later (1866), Brigham Young directed Smith to take a [[Plural marriage|plural wife]]. Levira gave her permission and was present at the marriage of Smith and [[Julina Lambson]] (who became the mother of future president Joseph Fielding Smith) -- a longtime friend of hers. Levira became disenchanted with the plural marriage arrangement and divorced Smith in 1868 and moved to California.<ref>Smith. ''Joseph F. Smith'', p. 231.</ref>\n{{clear}}\nSmith ultimately adopted five children and fathered forty-five children. Thirteen of his biological children preceded him in death: Mercy, Leonora, Sarah Ellen, Heber, Rhoda, Alice, Hyrum, Alfred, Albert, Robert, Zina, Ruth, and John.

Smith in the Sacred Grove.jpg|175px|thumb|right|<center>Joseph F. Smith in the [[Sacred Grove (Latter Day Saints)|Sacred Grove]], ca. 1905</center>]]\n\nOn July 1, 1866, Smith became a [[general authority]] of the LDS Church when he was ordained an [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] by Brigham Young and [[common consent (Latter Day Saints)|sustained]] as a counselor to the First Presidency, where he served until Young's death. However, he was not sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles until the church's October 1867 conference. On February 28, 1874, Smith left for his second mission to England, serving as [[mission president|president]] of the European [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]] from 1874 to 1875, returning home upon the death of First Presidency member George A. Smith. He was then called to preside over the Davis [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|Stake]] until he left again in the spring of 1877 for his third mission to England. When news arrived of the death of Young, Smith was released and returned home. The following year, Smith served an Eastern States Mission with [[Orson Pratt]], visiting noteworthy places in the history of the church in [[Missouri]], [[Ohio]], [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Illinois]]. During this trip they met with and interviewed [[David Whitmer]].\n\nIn October 1880, three years after Young's death, Smith was named second counselor in the First Presidency to church president [[John Taylor (Latter Day Saints)|John Taylor]], serving from 1880 to 1887. He later served as second counselor to [[Wilford Woodruff]] (1889\u201398), and as second counselor to Lorenzo Snow (1898\u20131901). Smith was appointed first counselor to Snow on the death of first counselor [[George Q. Cannon]], but, as Snow himself died only four days later, Smith never served in that position. He succeeded Snow as president of the LDS Church and [[Temple president|president]] of the [[Salt Lake Temple]]. He served as president of the temple until 1911, when he transferred the responsibility to [[Anthon H. Lund]].\n\nSmith also served as editor of the ''[[Improvement Era]]'' and ''[[Juvenile Instructor]]'', and general superintendent of the [[Sunday School (LDS Church)|Sunday School]] and [[Young Men (organization)|Young Men's Mutual Improvement Association]].\n\nSmith felt it was important for Utah to become a state, and thereby eliminate the ongoing federal supervision of [[Utah Territory]]. Following the official discontinuance of new [[1890 Manifesto|plural marriages]] by Woodruff in 1890, and the dissolution of the Mormon [[People's Party (Utah)|People's Party]] in 1891, Smith championed the anti-polygamy [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in Utah.\n\n==LDS Church President==\nAfter the death of church president Lorenzo Snow, Smith was chosen by the apostles of the church as Snow's successor.

Gary|title=Lost legacy: The Mormon office of presiding patriarch|date=1996|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Champaign, IL|isbn=0252021630|edition=1}}</ref> This action was ratified by a special conference and [[solemn assembly]] of the priesthood on November 10, 1901. He chose [[John R. Winder]] and [[Anthon H. Lund]] as his counselors. After Winder died, Lund became the first counselor and Smith's second cousin, [[John Henry Smith]], became the second counselor.\n\n===Polygamy issues===\nOne of the first issues Smith faced was the ongoing difficulties for the church due to the continuing practice of plural marriage. Smith supported apostle [[Reed Smoot]]'s candidacy for the [[U.S. Senate]], but Smoot's election was contested on the grounds that he was an officer in a church which continued to countenance polygamous marriages. The [[Smoot Hearings|Senate investigation]] again focused national attention on Mormon marriages and political influence. Additional attention was given to Smith because of his opposition to the election and re-election of Utah's senior U.S. Senator, non-Mormon [[Thomas Kearns]].<ref>O. N. Malmquist, The First 100 Years: A History of the Salt Lake Tribune, Utah State Historical Society, 1971.</ref> Following his appearance before a Senate panel in 1904, Smith took steps to prevent any surreptitious continuation of church plural marriages. On April 6, 1904, Smith issued the \"[[Second Manifesto]]\", and declared that any church officer who performed a plural marriage, as well as the offending couple, would be excommunicated. He clarified that the church's policy against new plural marriages applied worldwide, and not just in the United States. Two members of the Quorum of the Twelve, [[John W. Taylor (Mormon)|John W. Taylor]] and [[Matthias F. Cowley]], resigned in 1905 following these announcements. Smith, however, continued to live with his plural wives as did other Mormon polygamists. In 1906, Smith was brought to trial on a charge of unlawful [[cohabitation]] with four women in addition to his lawful wife; he pleaded guilty and was fined $300, the maximum penalty then permitted under the law.<ref>''Deseret Evening News'', November 23, 1906; ''Salt Lake Tribune'', November 24, 1906.</ref>\n\n===Other noteworthy actions===\nSmith gave more influence to the [[Presiding Patriarch]] of the church than had any president since Joseph Smith. The church's presiding patriarch, [[John Smith (nephew of Joseph Smith)|John Smith]], was his elder half-brother. During his presidency, Smith apparently pushed to change the order in which church leaders were sustained in general conferences. He intended to have the presiding patriarch sustained before even himself (as president of the church), consistent with his interpretation of [[Doctrine and Covenants]] Section 124 and early historical precedent.<ref name=\"Bates Lost Legacy\" /> This met with opposition from the other apostles, and the proposal was not realized.\n\nIn 1906, Smith went on a tour to Europe, becoming the first LDS Church president to travel outside of North America during his presidential tenure.\n\nIn 1908, Smith organized a committee to standardize and reform the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic Priesthood]] quorums. This committee standardized the age requirements for young men to be ordained to the office of [[Teacher (Latter Day Saints)|Teacher]] or [[Priest (Latter Day Saints)|Priest]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hartley|first1=William|title=The Priesthood Reform Movement, 1908-1922|journal=Brigham Young University Studies|date=1973}}</ref>\n\nSmith's seventeen-year presidential administration made efforts toward improving the church's [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and politics in the United States|damaged relationships with the federal government]] and related issues dealing with the church's financial situation. The administration acquired historic sites, constructed numerous meetinghouses, and expanded the church system of educational academies and universities. He also oversaw a continued growth in church membership.\n\nDuring Smith's presidential tenure, the LDS Church constructed and dedicated the [[Joseph Smith Birthplace Memorial]] near [[South Royalton, Vermont]]. It was dedicated by Smith on December 23, 1905, the 100th anniversary of Joseph Smith's birth. Also during Smith's presidency, the [[Seagull Monument]] at [[Temple Square]] in Salt Lake City was dedicated on October 1, 1913. In 1913, Boy Scouting became the official youth activity program for the church's young men. During much of his presidential tenure, Smith oversaw the planning and construction of the [[Laie Hawaii Temple|Hawaiian Temple]] in [[Laie, Hawaii]], one of his part-time residences. Smith died at Salt Lake City on November 19, 1918 during the [[1918 flu pandemic|Influenza Epidemic of that year]], a year before the Hawaiian Temple was to be dedicated. Smith left a body of religious writings often used in discussing church doctrine and religious conduct.\n\n===Death===\nSmith died of [[pneumonia]] resulting from [[pleurisy]] in Salt Lake City on November 19, 1918,<ref>[http://images.archives.utah.gov/data/81448/2229752/2229752_0000939.jpg State of Utah Death Certificate] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326225159/http://images.archives.utah.gov/data/81448/2229752/2229752_0000939.jpg |date=2009-03-26 }}.</ref> and was succeeded by [[Heber J. Grant]]. Due to the widespread [[Spanish flu|influenza]] pandemic of 1918\u201320, a graveside service was held, rather than a public funeral. Smith was interred in the Salt Lake City cemetery on November 22, 1918.\n\n[[Image:JosephFSmithGrave.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Grave marker of Joseph F. Smith, and [[Julina Lambson Smith]], one of his wives]]\n\n==Doctrinal contributions==\nDuring his administration as President of the Church, Smith made significant official statements of Latter-day Saint doctrine:\n\n*\"The Origin of Man\": In November 1909, in the midst of public interest in theories of evolution, the First Presidency issued a statement that affirmed that God created man in his own image. The document also succinctly reiterates the Mormon doctrine of a twofold creation (spiritual followed by temporal), the premortal existence of man, and ends noting that man, as a child of God, is capable of [[exaltation (Mormonism)|evolving into a god]].\n*\"The Father and the Son\": On June 20, 1916, the First Presidency and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles issued a statement examining the Mormon use of the term \"Father\" in scripture, clarifying times when the word refers to God the Father and when the word refers to Jesus Christ. The statement identified four different uses of the word \"Father.\" God the Father is the literal parent of the spirits of mankind and the earthly father of Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is referred to as \"the Father\" when discussing his role as creator of the earth, when he acts as \"the Father\" of those who abide in his gospel, and when he acts with the authority of his Heavenly Father while on earth.\n*\"Vision of the Redemption of the Dead\": On October 3, 1918, Smith received a [[Revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] on the nature of the [[Spirit world (Latter Day Saints)|spirit world]] and on Jesus Christ's role in ensuring that the gospel is taught to all men, living and dead. A written account of the revelation was submitted to the general authorities of the church on October 31, 1918, and was unanimously accepted. The revelation was initially published in December 1918, and was added to the [[Pearl of Great Price (Latter Day Saints)|Pearl of Great Price]], one of the church's scriptural [[standard works]], in April 1976; it has since been removed from the Pearl of Great Price and added to the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] as section 138. This revelation complemented an 1894 statement on the eternal nature of the family and appropriate temple work for the dead issued by Woodruff. Genealogy work by members of the LDS Church increased after both of these statements.\n\nFunded by Lorenzo N. Stohl, the sermons and writings of Smith were compiled by [[John A. Widtsoe]], [[Osborne J. P. Widtsoe]], [[Albert E. Bowen]], [[Franklin S. Harris]], and Joseph Quinney. In 1919, the Committee on Study for the Priesthood Quorums of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints had this work published as the book ''Gospel Doctrine'', for use as instruction for [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] [[Quorum (Latter Day Saints)|quorums]] of the church.\n\nSmith's [[Teachings of Presidents of the Church|teachings as an apostle]] were the 2000\u201301 course of study in the LDS Church's Sunday [[Relief Society]] and Melchizedek priesthood classes.\n\n== Ancestry ==\n{{ahnentafel |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|1=1.
