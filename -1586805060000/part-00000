The latter term is not to be confused with [[Idealism|metaphysical idealism]], a viewpoint about existence and [[rationality]] unrelated to the ethical concept.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe term \"ideal\" is applied not only to individuals but also to organizations large and small from [[church (congregation)|independent churches]] to [[Activism|social activist groups]] to [[Political party|political parties]] to [[nation state]]s and more. An entity's ideals usually function as a way to set firm guidelines for [[decision making]], with the possibility of having to sacrifice and undergo loss being in the background. While ideals constitute [[fuzzy concept]]s without that clear-cut a definition, they remain an influential part not just of personal choice but of larger, civilization-wide social direction. Ideals as a topic receive both scholarly and layman discussion within a variety of fields including [[philosophy]] both historically and more recently.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broader context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai>{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeTEDwAAQBAJ|first=Kai|last=Cabrera|publisher=[[Scientific e-Resources]]|date=2018|title=Ethics for Governance|ISBN=9781839473906|pages=1-3}}</ref> Whether [[Ethics in religion|based in religious traditions]] or [[Secular ethics|fundamentally secular]], an entity's relative prioritization of ideals often serves to indicate the extent of that entity's moral dedication. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]] yet expresses the willingness to [[lie]] to protect a friend demonstrates not only devotion to the different ideal of [[friendship]] but also belief in that other ideal to supersede honesty in importance. A particular case of this, frequently known as 'the inquiring murderer', is well-known as an intellectual criticism of [[Kantianism]] and its [[categorical imperative]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nBroader philosophical schools with a strong emphasis on idealistic viewpoints include [[Christian ethics]], [[Jewish ethics]], and [[Platonist ethics]].<ref name=rorty/> The development of state-based and international ideals in terms of large-scale social policy has additionally been long studied by scholars, their analysis looking particularly at the [[Foresight (psychology)|psychological foresight]] and determination required to manage effective foreign policy. [[Democratic peace theory]] in [[international relations]] study is an example.{{fact|date=April 2020}} [[Idealism in international relations|Idealism in the context of foreign relations]] generally involves advocating for institutions that enact measures such as [[international law]] implementation in order to avoid [[warfare]].<ref name=global/>\n\nA variety of different issues in analyzing idealistic ethics exist. Specifically, scholars such as [[Terry Eagleton]] have opined that the practical plausibility of particular ideals winds up being inverse to their intellectual legitimacy. Thus, an idealist with values at odds with his or her actual behavior stands apart, in Eagleton's view, from one who sets forth his or her ethics based fundamentally on his or her pragmatic desires, the latter person's set of principles losing the philosophically appealing nature of the former person's views.<ref name=terry/> As well, thinkers such as [[Richard Rorty]] have criticized the very concept of unchanging ideals existing somewhat separately from [[human nature]] in the first place.<ref name=rorty/> In the [[Politics|political context]], scholars such as [[Gerald Gaus]] have argued that particular strains of idealism cause individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy, ideals getting in the way of incremental yet meaningful progress.<ref name=will/>\n\nHistorically, advocates for idealism in the context of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" include [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[John Locke]]. Their emphasis on rational thinking led them to develop theories of ideal [[morality]] based around [[reason]]. Works authored by the former on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', and ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the later commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no clear-cut divide exists between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=frederick>{{citejournal|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=April 7, 2020|authorlink=Frederick Rauscher|first=Frederick|last=Rauscher|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/anthropology-from-a-pragmatic-point-of-view/}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of demonstrated life experience and the proliferation of personal stories via [[mass media]], multiple idealistic individuals have received attention as [[moral example]]s for others to draw understanding from. For instance, [[United States]] leaders known for their idealism include [[President of the United States|presidents]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]],<ref name=hull/><ref name=lecture/> [[Ronald Reagan]],<ref name=diggins/><ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Barack Obama]],<ref name=outdated/><ref name=sarson/><ref name=union/> while [[Europe|European]] officials similarly known for such ethical attitudes include [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Prime Minister of France]] and senior general,<ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Prime Minister of Germany]].<ref name=craig/><ref name=global/><ref name=hans/> [[Juan Manuel Santos]] of [[Colombia]] has gained attention in terms of the [[Central America|central]] and [[South America|south Americas]].<ref name=jesse/><ref name=laboratory/> Private individuals known for their prominent ideals include [[Fred Rogers]], U.S. [[television personality]],<ref name=rogers/> and [[Terry Fox]], Canadian [[athlete]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]] advocate.<ref name=derringer/><ref name=hero/><ref name=mile/> Multiple idealistically optimistic characters have been featured in prominent creative media, the [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' franchise]] centered around [[space exploration]] being a well-known instance of fictional idealism.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/> In addition, [[Music|musical]] artists known for creating songs with an atmosphere of idealism include [[singer-songwriters]] [[David Bowie]],<ref name=bowie/> [[Curtis Mayfield]],<ref name=roots/> and [[Tom Paxton]],<ref name=weissman/> with [[Musical group|bands]] [[The Beatles]],<ref name=beatles/> [[Queen (band)|Queen]],<ref name=queen/> and [[Maze (band)|Maze]] being examples as well.<ref name=maze/>\n\n==Background and history==\n===Applications of different terminology===\nThe term \"idealism\" and the related labeling, whether self-applied or otherwise, of individuals and/or groups as being \"idealistic\" or against such viewpoints has a certain complexity to it. In the sense of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical thought]], \"[[idealism]]\" is generally described as centering around a particular view of objective reality versus the perception of reality; the question of whether or not potential [[knowledge]] exists independently to humanity or whether such knowledge is solely tied to experiences in the mind gets debated. Even within that particular intellectual sphere, the stamp of \"idealist\" as applied to particular [[Philosophy|philosophers]], with them often possessing rather nuanced views, attracts considerable controversy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Colloquialism|colloquial language]], the term \"ideal\" is often applied loosely, with varying circumstances getting described as such in highly different contexts. For instance, in [[cooking]] the descriptions of certain ingredient portions, heating temperatures, preparation times, and the like are often labeled as \"ideal\" or otherwise. Such uses of the term are also highly distinct from the historical and social concept of having an \"ethical ideal\" as such.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Definitions and justifications===\n[[File:Plato_Pio-Clementino_Inv305_n2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] argued that ideals exist in a kind of independence from humanity such that [[reason]] discovers the principles rather than simply creates them.<ref name=nicholas/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Untied States|American]] philosopher [[Ralph Barton Perry]] has defined idealistic [[morality]] as being the result of a particular viewpoint about knowledge itself, writing in his book ''The Moral Economy'',\n{{Quote|\"Moral idealism means to interpret life consistently with ethical, scientific, and metaphysical truth. It endeavors to justify the maximum of hope, without compromising or confusing any enlightenment judgement of truth. In this it is, I think, not only consistent with the spirit of a liberal and rational age but also with the primary motive of religion. There can be no religion... without an open and candid mind as well as an indomitable purpose.\"<ref name=perry/>}}\n\nSomewhat in contrast, American scholar [[Nicholas Rescher]] has stated that the metaphysical nature of ideals gives them a particular status as \"useful fictions\" in terms of their special existence, writing in his book ''Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals'',\n{{quote|\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, ''exist'' as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful[ly] organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and [also] a stimulus to action.\"<ref name=nicholas/>}}\n\nNonetheless, multiple thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as flesh and blood people and similar concrete entities. A prominent example of this certain viewpoint is the iconic Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. To him, ideals represent self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through [[reason]] rather than invented out of whole cloth for narrow benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possess a certain kind of metaphysical independence according to Plato.<ref name=nicholas/>\n\n===Historical development and recent analysis===\n====Ideals from early history to the Age of Reason====\n[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient cynicism|Ancient cynics]] such as [[Diogenes]] dismissed [[Optimism|optimistic]] views of [[human nature]] as baseless given common brutality, with the moral ideals of the time receiving skepticism as he sought his own internal compass.<ref name=cynic/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the wider context of [[ethics]], the very terms \"ethical\" and \"ideal\" have been inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai/> Thus, ideals have been the topic of discussion and debate since the beginnings of organized human [[civilization]]. The types of ideals dealt with during the [[history of philosophy]] have varied widely over the many centuries, many conceptions existing of what moral idealism actually is and how it gets applied in actual life experiences.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom [[Ancient history|the far distant history]] to today, multiple philosophers have remarked that human beings appear to, by instinct, behave in a matter with few if any ideals and even general morals of whatever kind. The works of [[United Kingdom|British]] thinker [[David Hume]], for instance, explicitly declared people to be inherent \"[[Slavery|slaves]]\" to their passions.<ref name=kant/> When articulating a particularly nuanced theory of morality, Hume's writings labeled it folly to emphasize what people hopefully wish to achieve and additionally argued that enforcing ideals without proper grounding in practical, already existing mores undermines society itself.<ref>{{citenews|journal=[[The Nation (journal)|The Nation]]|accessdate=April 7, 2020|title=Hume's Call to Action|authorlink=Richard Bourke (academic)|date=April 20, 2016|first=Richard|last=Bourke|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/humes-call-to-action/}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient cynicism|Cynics of the ancient world]] frequently referred to humanity in general as not only not perfectible but fundamentally depraved. The historical [[Greece|Greek]] figure of [[Diogenes]], while arguing that some individuals could through great effort achieve some kind of a moral dignity, was a prominent example in his dismissal of the values common in his day. He sought his own path based on a particular set of ideals that involved begging on the streets, living in a barrel, and wearing rags.<ref name=cynic>{{citeweb|url=https://academyofideas.com/2013/05/diogenes-the-cynic/|title=Diogenes the Cynic|accessdate=April 6, 2020|date=May 26, 2013|website=[[AcademyofIdeas.com]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sermon-on-the-mount-tiffany.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sermon on the Mount]] constituted an important moment in the development of [[Christian ethics]], Jesus setting forth ideals that later spread throughout the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=duiker/>]]\n\nIn both [[Jewish ethics]] and later [[Christian ethics]], however, advocacy for a stridently idealistic view of the world, in which principles get held over personal convenience and even otherwise perfectly logical expectations, has attracted praise. [[Golden rule]] based moral standards have involved restrictions such as holding back the quest for [[Vengeance (concept)|vengeance]] by the wronged such that punishment only gets applied in a limited, specific fashion, this example being later evaluated as the [[tit-for-tat]] strategy in [[game theory]]. In terms of [[Christianity]], the teachings of the [[Gospels]] have constituted an extension of the golden rule; individuals, under [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] example, have gotten called to hold to the ideal of treating other people even better than they rationally expect to be treated back.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the context of the various religious movements of the 1st and 2nd century in the [[Roman Empire]], the ideals of Christian thinking constituted a radical break with the ethical doctrines that had been advocated by those in power. Rejecting views of the upper classes, both during the empire's time and previously in Greco-Roman civilization, the rising Christian community set forth clear-cut principles based on narratives such as the [[Sermon on the Mount]], which was included in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. Specifically, Jesus' exhortations for his followers to \"[[turn the other cheek]]\" as well to \"love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you\" and practice other idealistic behaviors established a general view emphasizing spiritual standards over material concerns.<ref name=duiker>{{citebook|title=World History, Volume I|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|date=2008|first1=William J.|last1=Duiker|first2=Jackson J.|last2=Spielvogel|pages=148-151|ISBN=9780495569022|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arxyJC05vScC}}</ref>\n\nDespite the degree that Christian viewpoints contradicted Roman traditions, [[early Christianity]] spread throughout the Empire and became a particularly robust force in the empire's society by the 4th century. Reasons for the appeal included not only the idealistic messages but also the similarity between the belief system and previously popular [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cults]]. Finally, emperor [[Theodosius the Great]] made Christianity the official religion of the entire realm.<Ref name=duiker/>\n\nWhile [[Western world|Western nations]] widely retained the influences of Jewish and Christian morality over multiple centuries, in practical terms a great many powerful rulers and prominent thinkers both before and after the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] pushed back on higher notions of idealistic ethics. Many did so based on little other than expediency. However, whether explicitly in words or implicitly through deeds, more cynical figures have counter-argued from points of view that can broadly be labeled as \"[[moral relativism]]\". As the arguments have gone, human beings have been little more than crude matter and cannot reasonably be held to act based in any sort of larger principle; survival has remained people's core instinct such that civilization, through relativist eyes, functions as a thin veneer over base instincts.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMultiple philosophers have argued in favor of particular types of idealism as well for years. The course of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" from the 17th to the 19th centuries, being a movement that in large part centered around the application of rationality-based principles such as the [[scientific method]] upon [[human nature]], caused increased interest in ethical philosophy as a field of study. Notions of \"benevolence\" attracted widespread attention in terms of [[Government|governance]], with leaders exhorted to act based on idealistic principles and to particularly champion causes such as the facilitating of [[the arts]], increased [[Education|educational efforts]], effective stewardship of [[national resources]], and so on. This movement increased trends away from [[absolute monarchy]] and [[dictatorship]] towards that of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Republic|republican government]]. The scientifically based, forward thinking viewpoint about human nature when applied to socio-political organization became later known as \"[[classical liberalism]]\".{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[John Locke]], a prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], articulated a vision of the individual and collective pursuit of ideals arising from the logical study and analysis of the state of nature.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\nIn terms of broader discussions on ethics, many classical Enlightenment thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]] have famously argued that strong moral standards on individual choice exist based upon standards of [[rationality]] that can be found through [[Logic|logical analysis]] by reasonable observers. Specifically, instrumental principles based on satisfying one\u2019s desires made up the basis for morality through Hobbes' approach. External principles existing in the discoverable state of nature outside of human experience that became possible to tease out due to personal study constituted Locke's theoretical background for ideals and broader ethics.<ref name=kant>{{citeweb|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|title=Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith respect to social order, Locke's highly influential writings applied rational principles to governance in support of the doctrine of [[social contract theory]], which permeated Enlightenment discussions about the best form of organizing a country. Locke's works such as the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' set forth an ethical framework in which rational individuals establish a government in order to guarantee their fundamental rights and possess the understanding that they not only can but should alter said government when rational application of the fair-minded \"[[rule of law]]\" has broken down. Thus, Locke labeled fundamental change as a natural consequence of when [[liberty]] no longer receives protection. He criticized competing theories such as the [[divine right of kings]], which the thinker viewed as folly.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn terms of individual thinking on principles, Locke never wrote a single work laying down in depth his conceptual understanding of ethics and morality. However, Lockean thought as described in various writings have emphasized holding to prominent ideals about human behavior in terms of the rational capacity for good, a particular topic of Locke's concern having been the power of education. Locke wrote of its importance within the pages of ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]''. Outlining the best way to rear children in his eyes, Lockean arguments stressed that virtuous actions by adults arose as a direct result of the habits of body and mind taught during youth by forward thinking instructors.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nLocke wrote in his work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' dividing rational understanding into three inherent areas of scope, the philosopher defining the second as \"practica\" and describing it as,\n{{quote|\"The skill of right applying our own powers and actions, for the attainment of things good and useful. The most considerable... is ethics, which is the seeking out those rules and measures of human actions, which lead to happiness, and the means to practise them. The end of this is not bare speculation and the knowledge of truth; but right, and a conduct suitable to it.\"<ref>John Locke. ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Chapter XXI. ''Of the Division of the Sciences''.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Immanuel Kant 3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Thinker [[Immanuel Kant]]'s views on idealistic morality aligned the human ethical experience with that of rationality and the greater world,<ref name=frederick/> the philosopher labeling immorality not only wrong on principle but illogical.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\n[[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s particular view of [[human nature]] and intellectual inquiry, later summed up under the banner of \"[[Kantianism]]\", stressed the inherent power of logical thinking in terms of moral analysis. Kant's advocacy for the \"[[categorical imperative]]\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has to be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. In Kant's writings, defiance of higher idealistic principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well.<ref name=kant/>\n\nWorks authored by Kant on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> Within the pages of ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' in particular, the philosopher articulated a vision of people as by their very essence driven by meaningful ethics. Through the lens of Kant's doctrine, no ironclad divide has existed between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with studies of people's ideals.<ref name=frederick/>\n\nSumming up Kant's views on ideals in context, scholar Frederick P. Van De Pitte has written,\n{{quote|\"Kant realized that man's rational capacity alone is not sufficient to constitute his dignity and elevate him above the brutes. If reason only enables him to do for himself what instinct does for the animal, then it would indicate for man no higher aim or destiny than that of the brute but only a different way of attaining the same end. However, reason is man's most essential attribute because it is the means by which a truly distinctive dimension is made possible for him. Reason, that is, reflective awareness, makes it possible to distinguish between good and bad, and thus morality can be made the ruling purpose of life. Because man can consider an array of possibilities, and which among them is the most desirable, he can strive to make himself and his world into a realization of his ideals.\"<ref name=anthropology/>}}\n\n====Ideals in post-Enlightenment thought====\n\nBroadly speaking, Western philosophy in terms of its discussion of ideals largely takes place within the framework of Enlightenment thinking, with figures such as the aforementioned Hobbes, Kant, and Locke dominating debate. As per the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], itself an evolution from the earlier [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], many theorizing academics of the 19th century and the 20th century have set forth an [[Optimism|optimistic]] view of humanity. Through this moralistic lens, all individuals by nature of their mere existence have been thought to have been born inherently [[Good and evil|good]], inherently [[Social equality|equal]], and inherently [[Freedom|free]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nA defining inflection point of this trend has been the experience of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. The historical memory has been argued to have created a sort of dualistic approach to [[ideology]] in which [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]], centered around classical liberalism, gets inherently pitted forever in struggle with [[Tyranny|tyrannies]], centered around the [[Social stratification|stratification of various groups over others]] and mass misery. In the aftermath of the end of the [[Cold War]], studies upon moral idealism have often asked if Enlightenment viewpoints face an inherent intellectual challenge that the doctrines cannot eventually overcome.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the advent of the 21st century, philosophizers have debated the rapid evolution of different cultures, particularly given advancing technology, and the seeming acceptance of [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian values]] previously thought of as radical or undesirable by [[Center-left politics|center-left]], [[Political moderation|moderate]], and [[Center-right politics|center-right]] individuals. The conflict between these people, many of them belonging to younger generations such as the [[Millennials]], and those [[Political extremism|political extremists]] of the [[Far-right politics|global far-right movement]], the social trend often called \"[[Neo-nationalism|new nationalism]]\", has defined new distinctions between what it means to be a \"moral idealist\". As well, the question of the fundamental [[Biology|biological]] advancement of humanity itself has attracted much attention. What a [[transhuman]] or even [[posthuman]] individual would possess terms of ideals in contrast with regular human beings has remained an open question.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broadest sense, the question of whether or not humanity as a whole has fundamentally progressed towards a set of moral ideals over time has never achieved any particular consensus. Examples of philosophers who argue partially in support of the notion include the American thinker [[Richard Rorty]], a figure who has criticized the very concept of unchanging ethical principles set forth in inherent nature while still lauding general social progress.<ref name=rorty/> In contrast, multiple scholars concerned with issues such as [[global climate change]] and potential use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in future [[warfare]] have lamented particular [[Technology|technological advancements]] and related alterations in broader social culture, the thinkers arguing that fundamental moral progress has truly not occurred given forms of increasing danger to humanity.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:TeilhardP 1947.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a [[Jesuit]] priest and scientist, wrote that moral progress and [[biological evolution]] would converge to unify all in an idealistic existence with [[God]].<ref name=allen/><ref name=langan/><ref name=salem/>]]\n\nOne optimistic view arising in the 20th century and continuing to receive notice is that of prominent [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] figure [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]].

Known as the \"Catholic Darwin\", his view of evolutionary advancement came out of a religious context through which he identified humanity's final state with Jesus Christ as the \"[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]\" or sacred \"Word\".

In some theories of applied ethics, relative importance has gotten assigned to certain social preferences over others as a way to [[Dispute resolution|resolve disputes effectively]]. In analysis of [[legal theory]], for instance, [[judge]]s have been sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would likely advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of broader [[social equality]], which would likely advise seeking to restore goodwill between individuals regardless of specific findings during a particular case. Said judges have also been required to consider the principle of the [[right to a speedy trial]] as well, which places limits on the previous two ideals given the time involved in ferreting out details.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn an August 2005 address, philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] remarked upon the \"moral idealism common to Platonism, Judaism, and Christianity\" and the related notion of strictly specified principles through the lens of applied ethics, asserting to a group of business professionals,\n{{quote|\"[I]ndividuals become aware of more alternatives, and therefore wiser, as they grow older.

Specifically, certain authors known as \"[[New atheism|new atheists]]\" such as biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] and journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] have argued that newly emerging forms of [[secular ethics]] constitute an approach of people treating each other that is more logical, just, and reasonable when seen as a rejoinder to previous forms of \"traditional values\". At the same time, multiple thinkers have advocated for moral relativism and a reduced or non-existent sense of holding to previously well-promoted ideals as a direct result of their wholesale rejection of religion. As well, scholars regardless of personal faith background have commented about the complex nature of ethics when taken from spiritual movements.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Idealistic appeals in practice==\n===In conceptual and historical politics===\n\n[[File:Pericles.jpg|thumb|right|Greek statesman [[Pericles]]' vision of [[Athenian democracy]] stressed a sense of what he saw as core ideals, particularly the intelligence and tolerance displayed by Athenians.<ref name=pericles/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdeals have played a role in [[politics]] for [[millennia]].

In contrast to what he saw as [[decadence]] spreading into [[Rome]] and nearby areas from elsewhere, Cato articulated support for what he labeled as traditional Roman ethics.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost [[Revolution|political revolutions]] have drawn support from the mass appeal of a certain moral idealism in contrast to the doctrines of those holding [[Power (sociology)|power]], having the various grievances with the status quo created from real or perceived misrule spark ethical debate. During the [[French Revolution]], the rhetorical principles of ''\"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\"'' (English: ''\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\"'') got raised to the status of clear-cut ideals; the new [[nation state]] constituted a sort of grand experiment in what became in de facto and later de jure a new religion. Many political movements in modern times have centered themselves upon multiple ideals found to be mutually reinforcing. Recent examples have included the [[peace movement]] and the broader opposition expressed worldwide to war in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] as well as elsewhere.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn many cases current and historical, instances have popped up in which proclaimed ideals simply weren't lived up to by various figures while in office, despite claims made by the officials before taking power and since attaining it. In [[British English]], politicians openly changing their opinions in defiance of previous assertions about their ethics have been labeled as making a \"u-turn\". In [[American English]], similar individuals have been pejoratively called \"flip-floppers\". While different, the terms [[U-turn (politics)|have meant the same thing]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdealism in the context of politics has attracted criticism from multiple fronts. For instance, U.S. philosopher [[Gerald Gaus]], the author of ''[[The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society]]'', has prominently argued that an overriding emphasis on ideals causes individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy as well as logical choices during [[Election|elections]]. Gaus has made other warnings such as cautioning that people can lose their sense of how much has already been achieved and how well current situations have become in certain circumstances. In general, Gaus has advocated for [[compromise]] and incremental socio-political reform.<ref name=will>{{citenews|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/8/4/12376522/political-idealism-enemy|date=August 4, 2016|title=How political idealism leads us astray|accessdate=April 4, 2020|authorlink=Will Wilkinson|first=Will|last=Wilkinson|publisher=[[Vox.com]]}}</ref>\n\n===In traditional achievement===\n[[File:TerryFoxToronto19800712.JPG|thumb|right|[[Athlete]] [[Terry Fox]] helped redefine the cultural image of [[Disability (human beings)|disabled individuals]] in his native [[Canada]] and elsewhere, his [[Charitable organization|charity]] work and upbeat attitude creating a reputation as an idealist and humanitarian.<ref name=derringer/><ref name=hero/><ref name=mile/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a less abstract sense, multiple famous private individuals have been thought to embody certain ideals due to multiple factors such as their [[courage]], [[intelligence]], [[personal endurance]], and so on.

In [[Islam]], for instance, the life of the prophet [[Muhammad]] has been held up as a comprehensive ideal for Muslims to study. However, all of his words and deeds must be interpreted for believers through the lens of his life's broader path and the larger religious context, according to Islamic scholars.

In contrast to only finding slight differences in terms of idealism by sex, the aforementioned ''International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration'' study concluded that particular gaps exist between generations; broadly speaking, the older an individual was, the more importance they gave to idealistic ethics according to the analysis.<ref name=poor/>\n\n===Ideals versus absolute or conditional obligations===\n\n[[File:Blood test (1).jpg|thumb|right|Obligated social standards, such as the various [[Social norms|norms]] around the [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|medical professional and patient relationship]], have been argued by thinkers as existing at a different plane than idealistic moral views.<ref name=norbert/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Norbert Paulo]] has stated that, in common life, ideals as such appear to exist in relation to general social obligations. Many of the latter concepts have tended to appear, according to Paulo, absolute and essentially mandatory while also existing in highly particular circumstances. For instance, Paulo has written, [[Physician|physicians]] and [[Nursing|nurses]] face a variety of [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|ethical obligations imposed on them when treating their patients]] that regular individuals encountering said patients randomly do not. He had added that a continuum exists between clear-cut, widely held obligations applied via [[Social norm|social norms]] and vague ones only partially behold to cultural sanction.<ref name=norbert/>\n\nPaulo's argument, thus, has concluded that idealist behavior takes place at a behavioral and mental level above and beyond mere social rules, such actions being \"warranted\" yet \"not strictly required\" either while their optional nature sets them up as being \"praiseworthy\". Ideals represent a method of putting into action an individual's [[personal character]] and its given traits such that, Paulo has argued, moral standards get fleshed out beyond the rigid framework of mere obligations. One person's altruistic caring for another generally has constituted a particular example.<ref name=norbert/>\n\n===Ideals versus virtues===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe line between an ideal and a [[virtue]] has been difficult to access. Ideals have been argued to inherently involve aspirations while virtues function as direct guides for assigned conduct given social standards.<ref name=norbert/> Analysis has run into problems given that both entities are [[fuzzy concept]]s. In general, some philosophers have argued that an ideal usually constitutes something more inherent that one can make a [[Habituation|habit]] while virtues, instead, necessarily involve going above and beyond regular decision making in order to actively strive for something. Thus, these thinkers have stated, virtues inherently constitute a behavior that's by its very nature highly difficult to turn into a regular practice. Other philosophers have made the exact opposite argument and seen virtues as fundamentally philosophically weaker entities than ideals.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nGiven the complexity of putting ideals into practice, not to mention resolving conflicts between them, many individuals have chosen to narrowly pick a certain group of them and then harden them into absolute [[dogma]]. Political theorist [[Bernard Crick]] has stated that a way to solve this [[dilemma]] is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a generalized process rather than a specific outcome, particularly when the latter is hard to achieve.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nKant wrote in his work ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' pitting idealism against the enactment of personal [[vice]], the philospher arguing,\n{{quote|\"Young man! Deny yourself satisfaction (of amusement, of debauchery, of love, etc.), not with the Stoical intention of complete abstinence, but with the refined Epicurean intention of having in view an ever-growing pleasure. This stinginess with the cash of your vital urge makes you definitely richer through the postponement of pleasure, even if you should, for the most part, renounce the indulgence of it until the end of your life. The awareness of having pleasure under your control is, like everything idealistic, more fruitful and more abundant than everything that satisfies the sense through indulgence because it is thereby simultaneously consumed and consequently lost from the aggregate of totality.\"<ref name=anthropology>{{citebook|title=[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|first=Immanuel|last=Kant|date=1996|translator=Victor Lyle Dowdell|publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]]|ISBN=9780809320608}}</ref>}}\n\n===Relative ideals===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Robert S. Hartman]] has contended that since, colloquially, labeling an entity as ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class, thus the term has particular implications when used in an ethical context. For example, he has stated, the ideal student constitutes the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since one can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, according to Hartman, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is to Hartman. Thus, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is worse than a very smooth one drawn with a compass' aid, but both are better than a regularly made square.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor Hartman, the world in general has presented a situation in which each particular entity ought usually to become more like its ideal if possible. This entails that, in [[ethics]], each individual should analogously to become more like the hypothetical ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self, in Hartman's view.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Totalizing ideals versus emergent ideals===\n\n[[File:Terry Eagleton in Manchester 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[Terry Eagleton]] has written critically about the practicality of ethical idealism.<ref name=terry/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe question of to what extent one can hold to certain ideals practically and how facing resistance will shape them has attracted debate from multiple thinkers. The related issue of to what extent idealistic morality held by individuals reflects broader cultures has done so as well. The extent to which human beings think through their behavior irrationally or rationally has been a major issue in these such discussions.<ref name=kelly/><ref name=terry/>\n\nOne 21st century philosopher who has delved into the topics is [[Terry Eagleton]]. Writing in his book ''After Theory'', he has commented critically about the practicality of ethical idealism, Eagleton arguing,\n{{quote|\"Moral values which state what you ought to do are impressively idealistic, but too blatantly at odds with your behaviour. Moral values\nwhich reflect what you actually do are far more plausible, but only at the cost of no longer serving to legitimate your activity.\"<ref name=terry>{{citebook|date=2004|authorlink=Terry Eagleton||title=After Theory|publisher=[[Penguin Publishing]]|pages=151-152|ISBN=9780141927886|first=Terry|last=Eagleton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3N6zL1qyHQC}}</ref>}}\n\nAnother 21st century philosopher who has questioned traditional understandings of idealistic morality is [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]]. In particular, his book ''As If: Idealization and Ideals'' examined the usefulness of the concepts and the processes through which they've been articulated. Appiah found fault in the general assumptions made by certain thinkers of human rationality and advocated for a larger understanding of the practical nature of the idealization process among scholars of multiple disciplines as well as laypeople.<ref name=kelly/>\n\nIn depth, Appiah's book presented a nuanced picture of ethical idealism in the context of cultural organization, the philosopher writing,\n{{quote|\"The history of our collective moral learning doesn't start with the growing acceptance of a picture of an ideal society.

The latter term is not to be confused with [[Idealism|metaphysical idealism]], a viewpoint about existence and [[rationality]] unrelated to the ethical concept.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe term \"ideal\" is applied not only to individuals but also to organizations large and small from [[church (congregation)|independent churches]] to [[Activism|social activist groups]] to [[Political party|political parties]] to [[nation state]]s and more. An entity's ideals usually function as a way to set firm guidelines for [[decision making]], with the possibility of having to sacrifice and undergo loss being in the background. While ideals constitute [[fuzzy concept]]s without that clear-cut a definition, they remain an influential part not just of personal choice but of larger, civilization-wide social direction. Ideals as a topic receive both scholarly and layman discussion within a variety of fields including [[philosophy]] both historically and more recently.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broader context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai>{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeTEDwAAQBAJ|first=Kai|last=Cabrera|publisher=[[Scientific e-Resources]]|date=2018|title=Ethics for Governance|ISBN=9781839473906|pages=1-3}}</ref> Whether [[Ethics in religion|based in religious traditions]] or [[Secular ethics|fundamentally secular]], an entity's relative prioritization of ideals often serves to indicate the extent of that entity's moral dedication. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]] yet expresses the willingness to [[lie]] to protect a friend demonstrates not only devotion to the different ideal of [[friendship]] but also belief in that other ideal to supersede honesty in importance. A particular case of this, frequently known as 'the inquiring murderer', is well-known as an intellectual criticism of [[Kantianism]] and its [[categorical imperative]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nBroader philosophical schools with a strong emphasis on idealistic viewpoints include [[Christian ethics]], [[Jewish ethics]], and [[Platonist ethics]].<ref name=rorty/> The development of state-based and international ideals in terms of large-scale social policy has additionally been long studied by scholars, their analysis looking particularly at the [[Foresight (psychology)|psychological foresight]] and determination required to manage effective foreign policy. [[Democratic peace theory]] in [[international relations]] study is an example.{{fact|date=April 2020}} [[Idealism in international relations|Idealism in the context of foreign relations]] generally involves advocating for institutions that enact measures such as [[international law]] implementation in order to avoid [[warfare]].<ref name=global/>\n\nA variety of different issues in analyzing idealistic ethics exist. Specifically, scholars such as [[Terry Eagleton]] have opined that the practical plausibility of particular ideals winds up being inverse to their intellectual legitimacy. Thus, an idealist with values at odds with his or her actual behavior stands apart, in Eagleton's view, from one who sets forth his or her ethics based fundamentally on his or her pragmatic desires, the latter person's set of principles losing the philosophically appealing nature of the former person's views.<ref name=terry/> As well, thinkers such as [[Richard Rorty]] have criticized the very concept of unchanging ideals existing somewhat separately from [[human nature]] in the first place.<ref name=rorty/> In the [[Politics|political context]], scholars such as [[Gerald Gaus]] have argued that particular strains of idealism cause individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy, ideals getting in the way of incremental yet meaningful progress.<ref name=will/>\n\nHistorically, advocates for idealism in the context of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" include [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[John Locke]]. Their emphasis on rational thinking led them to develop theories of ideal [[morality]] based around [[reason]]. Works authored by the former on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', and ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the later commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no clear-cut divide exists between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=frederick>{{citejournal|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=April 7, 2020|authorlink=Frederick Rauscher|first=Frederick|last=Rauscher|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/anthropology-from-a-pragmatic-point-of-view/}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of demonstrated life experience and the proliferation of personal stories via [[mass media]], multiple idealistic individuals have received attention as [[moral example]]s for others to draw understanding from. For instance, [[United States]] leaders known for their idealism include [[President of the United States|presidents]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]],<ref name=hull/><ref name=lecture/> [[Ronald Reagan]],<ref name=diggins/><ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Barack Obama]],<ref name=outdated/><ref name=sarson/><ref name=union/> while [[Europe|European]] officials similarly known for such ethical attitudes include [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Prime Minister of France]] and senior general,<ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Prime Minister of Germany]].<ref name=craig/><ref name=global/><ref name=hans/> [[Juan Manuel Santos]] of [[Colombia]] has gained attention in terms of the [[Central America|central]] and [[South America|south Americas]].<ref name=jesse/><ref name=laboratory/> Private individuals known for their prominent ideals include [[Fred Rogers]], U.S. [[television personality]],<ref name=rogers/> and [[Terry Fox]], Canadian [[athlete]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]] advocate.<ref name=derringer/><ref name=hero/><ref name=mile/> Multiple idealistically optimistic characters have been featured in prominent creative media, the [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' franchise]] centered around [[space exploration]] being a well-known instance of fictional idealism.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/> In addition, [[Music|musical]] artists known for creating songs with an atmosphere of idealism include [[singer-songwriters]] [[David Bowie]],<ref name=bowie/> [[Curtis Mayfield]],<ref name=roots/> and [[Tom Paxton]],<ref name=weissman/> with [[Musical group|bands]] [[The Beatles]],<ref name=beatles/> [[Queen (band)|Queen]],<ref name=queen/> and [[Maze (band)|Maze]] being examples as well.<ref name=maze/>\n\n==Background and history==\n===Applications of different terminology===\nThe term \"idealism\" and the related labeling, whether self-applied or otherwise, of individuals and/or groups as being \"idealistic\" or against such viewpoints has a certain complexity to it. In the sense of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical thought]], \"[[idealism]]\" is generally described as centering around a particular view of objective reality versus the perception of reality; the question of whether or not potential [[knowledge]] exists independently to humanity or whether such knowledge is solely tied to experiences in the mind gets debated. Even within that particular intellectual sphere, the stamp of \"idealist\" as applied to particular [[Philosophy|philosophers]], with them often possessing rather nuanced views, attracts considerable controversy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Colloquialism|colloquial language]], the term \"ideal\" is often applied loosely, with varying circumstances getting described as such in highly different contexts. For instance, in [[cooking]] the descriptions of certain ingredient portions, heating temperatures, preparation times, and the like are often labeled as \"ideal\" or otherwise. Such uses of the term are also highly distinct from the historical and social concept of having an \"ethical ideal\" as such.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Definitions and justifications===\n[[File:Plato_Pio-Clementino_Inv305_n2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] argued that ideals exist in a kind of independence from humanity such that [[reason]] discovers the principles rather than simply creates them.<ref name=nicholas/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Untied States|American]] philosopher [[Ralph Barton Perry]] has defined idealistic [[morality]] as being the result of a particular viewpoint about knowledge itself, writing in his book ''The Moral Economy'',\n{{Quote|\"Moral idealism means to interpret life consistently with ethical, scientific, and metaphysical truth. It endeavors to justify the maximum of hope, without compromising or confusing any enlightenment judgement of truth. In this it is, I think, not only consistent with the spirit of a liberal and rational age but also with the primary motive of religion. There can be no religion... without an open and candid mind as well as an indomitable purpose.\"<ref name=perry/>}}\n\nSomewhat in contrast, American scholar [[Nicholas Rescher]] has stated that the metaphysical nature of ideals gives them a particular status as \"useful fictions\" in terms of their special existence, writing in his book ''Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals'',\n{{quote|\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, ''exist'' as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful[ly] organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and [also] a stimulus to action.\"<ref name=nicholas/>}}\n\nNonetheless, multiple thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as flesh and blood people and similar concrete entities. A prominent example of this certain viewpoint is the iconic Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. To him, ideals represent self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through [[reason]] rather than invented out of whole cloth for narrow benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possess a certain kind of metaphysical independence according to Plato.<ref name=nicholas/>\n\n===Historical development and recent analysis===\n====Ideals from early history to the Age of Reason====\n[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient cynicism|Ancient cynics]] such as [[Diogenes]] dismissed [[Optimism|optimistic]] views of [[human nature]] as baseless given common brutality, with the moral ideals of the time receiving skepticism as he sought his own internal compass.<ref name=cynic/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the wider context of [[ethics]], the very terms \"ethical\" and \"ideal\" have been inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai/> Thus, ideals have been the topic of discussion and debate since the beginnings of organized human [[civilization]]. The types of ideals dealt with during the [[history of philosophy]] have varied widely over the many centuries, many conceptions existing of what moral idealism actually is and how it gets applied in actual life experiences.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom [[Ancient history|the far distant history]] to today, multiple philosophers have remarked that human beings appear to, by instinct, behave in a matter with few if any ideals and even general morals of whatever kind. The works of [[United Kingdom|British]] thinker [[David Hume]], for instance, explicitly declared people to be inherent \"[[Slavery|slaves]]\" to their passions.<ref name=kant/> When articulating a particularly nuanced theory of morality, Hume's writings labeled it folly to emphasize what people hopefully wish to achieve and additionally argued that enforcing ideals without proper grounding in practical, already existing mores undermines society itself.<ref>{{citenews|journal=[[The Nation (journal)|The Nation]]|accessdate=April 7, 2020|title=Hume's Call to Action|authorlink=Richard Bourke (academic)|date=April 20, 2016|first=Richard|last=Bourke|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/humes-call-to-action/}}</ref>\n\n[[Ancient cynicism|Cynics of the ancient world]] frequently referred to humanity in general as not only not perfectible but fundamentally depraved. The historical [[Greece|Greek]] figure of [[Diogenes]], while arguing that some individuals could through great effort achieve some kind of a moral dignity, was a prominent example in his dismissal of the values common in his day. He sought his own path based on a particular set of ideals that involved begging on the streets, living in a barrel, and wearing rags.<ref name=cynic>{{citeweb|url=https://academyofideas.com/2013/05/diogenes-the-cynic/|title=Diogenes the Cynic|accessdate=April 6, 2020|date=May 26, 2013|website=[[AcademyofIdeas.com]]}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sermon-on-the-mount-tiffany.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sermon on the Mount]] constituted an important moment in the development of [[Christian ethics]], Jesus setting forth ideals that later spread throughout the [[Roman Empire]].<ref name=duiker/>]]\n\nIn both [[Jewish ethics]] and later [[Christian ethics]], however, advocacy for a stridently idealistic view of the world, in which principles get held over personal convenience and even otherwise perfectly logical expectations, has attracted praise. [[Golden rule]] based moral standards have involved restrictions such as holding back the quest for [[Vengeance (concept)|vengeance]] by the wronged such that punishment only gets applied in a limited, specific fashion, this example being later evaluated as the [[tit-for-tat]] strategy in [[game theory]]. In terms of [[Christianity]], the teachings of the [[Gospels]] have constituted an extension of the golden rule; individuals, under [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] example, have gotten called to hold to the ideal of treating other people even better than they rationally expect to be treated back.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the context of the various religious movements of the 1st and 2nd century in the [[Roman Empire]], the ideals of Christian thinking constituted a radical break with the ethical doctrines that had been advocated by those in power. Rejecting views of the upper classes, both during the empire's time and previously in Greco-Roman civilization, the rising Christian community set forth clear-cut principles based on narratives such as the [[Sermon on the Mount]], which was included in the [[Gospel of Matthew]]. Specifically, Jesus' exhortations for his followers to \"[[turn the other cheek]]\" as well to \"love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you\" and practice other idealistic behaviors established a general view emphasizing spiritual standards over material concerns.<ref name=duiker>{{citebook|title=World History, Volume I|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|date=2008|first1=William J.|last1=Duiker|first2=Jackson J.|last2=Spielvogel|pages=148-151|ISBN=9780495569022|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=arxyJC05vScC}}</ref>\n\nDespite the degree that Christian viewpoints contradicted Roman traditions, [[early Christianity]] spread throughout the Empire and became a particularly robust force in the empire's society by the 4th century. Reasons for the appeal included not only the idealistic messages but also the similarity between the belief system and previously popular [[Greco-Roman mysteries|mystery cults]]. Finally, emperor [[Theodosius the Great]] made Christianity the official religion of the entire realm.<Ref name=duiker/>\n\nWhile [[Western world|Western nations]] widely retained the influences of Jewish and Christian morality over multiple centuries, in practical terms a great many powerful rulers and prominent thinkers both before and after the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] pushed back on higher notions of idealistic ethics. Many did so based on little other than expediency. However, whether explicitly in words or implicitly through deeds, more cynical figures have counter-argued from points of view that can broadly be labeled as \"[[moral relativism]]\". As the arguments have gone, human beings have been little more than crude matter and cannot reasonably be held to act based in any sort of larger principle; survival has remained people's core instinct such that civilization, through relativist eyes, functions as a thin veneer over base instincts.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMultiple philosophers have argued in favor of particular types of idealism as well for years. The course of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" from the 17th to the 19th centuries, being a movement that in large part centered around the application of rationality-based principles such as the [[scientific method]] upon [[human nature]], caused increased interest in ethical philosophy as a field of study. Notions of \"benevolence\" attracted widespread attention in terms of [[Government|governance]], with leaders exhorted to act based on idealistic principles and to particularly champion causes such as the facilitating of [[the arts]], increased [[Education|educational efforts]], effective stewardship of [[national resources]], and so on. This movement increased trends away from [[absolute monarchy]] and [[dictatorship]] towards that of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Republic|republican government]]. The scientifically based, forward thinking viewpoint about human nature when applied to socio-political organization became later known as \"[[classical liberalism]]\".{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[John Locke]], a prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], articulated a vision of the individual and collective pursuit of ideals arising from the logical study and analysis of the state of nature.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\nIn terms of broader discussions on ethics, many classical Enlightenment thinkers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]] have famously argued that strong moral standards on individual choice exist based upon standards of [[rationality]] that can be found through [[Logic|logical analysis]] by reasonable observers. Specifically, instrumental principles based on satisfying one\u2019s desires made up the basis for morality through Hobbes' approach. External principles existing in the discoverable state of nature outside of human experience that became possible to tease out due to personal study constituted Locke's theoretical background for ideals and broader ethics.<ref name=kant>{{citeweb|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|title=Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith respect to social order, Locke's highly influential writings applied rational principles to governance in support of the doctrine of [[social contract theory]], which permeated Enlightenment discussions about the best form of organizing a country. Locke's works such as the ''[[Two Treatises of Government]]'' set forth an ethical framework in which rational individuals establish a government in order to guarantee their fundamental rights and possess the understanding that they not only can but should alter said government when rational application of the fair-minded \"[[rule of law]]\" has broken down. Thus, Locke labeled fundamental change as a natural consequence of when [[liberty]] no longer receives protection. He criticized competing theories such as the [[divine right of kings]], which the thinker viewed as folly.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn terms of individual thinking on principles, Locke never wrote a single work laying down in depth his conceptual understanding of ethics and morality. However, Lockean thought as described in various writings have emphasized holding to prominent ideals about human behavior in terms of the rational capacity for good, a particular topic of Locke's concern having been the power of education. Locke wrote of its importance within the pages of ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]''. Outlining the best way to rear children in his eyes, Lockean arguments stressed that virtuous actions by adults arose as a direct result of the habits of body and mind taught during youth by forward thinking instructors.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nLocke wrote in his work ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' dividing rational understanding into three inherent areas of scope, the philosopher defining the second as \"practica\" and describing it as,\n{{quote|\"The skill of right applying our own powers and actions, for the attainment of things good and useful. The most considerable... is ethics, which is the seeking out those rules and measures of human actions, which lead to happiness, and the means to practise them. The end of this is not bare speculation and the knowledge of truth; but right, and a conduct suitable to it.\"<ref>John Locke. ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]''. Chapter XXI. ''Of the Division of the Sciences''.</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Immanuel Kant 3 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Thinker [[Immanuel Kant]]'s views on idealistic morality aligned the human ethical experience with that of rationality and the greater world,<ref name=frederick/> the philosopher labeling immorality not only wrong on principle but illogical.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\n[[Germany|German]] philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s particular view of [[human nature]] and intellectual inquiry, later summed up under the banner of \"[[Kantianism]]\", stressed the inherent power of logical thinking in terms of moral analysis. Kant's advocacy for the \"[[categorical imperative]]\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has to be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. In Kant's writings, defiance of higher idealistic principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well.<ref name=kant/>\n\nWorks authored by Kant on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> Within the pages of ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' in particular, the philosopher articulated a vision of people as by their very essence driven by meaningful ethics. Through the lens of Kant's doctrine, no ironclad divide has existed between morality and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with studies of people's ideals.<ref name=frederick/>\n\nSumming up Kant's views on ideals in context, scholar Frederick P. Van De Pitte has written,\n{{quote|\"Kant realized that man's rational capacity alone is not sufficient to constitute his dignity and elevate him above the brutes. If reason only enables him to do for himself what instinct does for the animal, then it would indicate for man no higher aim or destiny than that of the brute but only a different way of attaining the same end. However, reason is man's most essential attribute because it is the means by which a truly distinctive dimension is made possible for him. Reason, that is, reflective awareness, makes it possible to distinguish between good and bad, and thus morality can be made the ruling purpose of life. Because man can consider an array of possibilities, and which among them is the most desirable, he can strive to make himself and his world into a realization of his ideals.\"<ref name=anthropology/>}}\n\n====Ideals in post-Enlightenment thought====\n\nBroadly speaking, Western philosophy in terms of its discussion of ideals largely takes place within the framework of Enlightenment thinking, with figures such as the aforementioned Hobbes, Kant, and Locke dominating debate. As per the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], itself an evolution from the earlier [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], many theorizing academics of the 19th century and the 20th century have set forth an [[Optimism|optimistic]] view of humanity. Through this moralistic lens, all individuals by nature of their mere existence have been thought to have been born inherently [[Good and evil|good]], inherently [[Social equality|equal]], and inherently [[Freedom|free]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nA defining inflection point of this trend has been the experience of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]]. The historical memory has been argued to have created a sort of dualistic approach to [[ideology]] in which [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]], centered around classical liberalism, gets inherently pitted forever in struggle with [[Tyranny|tyrannies]], centered around the [[Social stratification|stratification of various groups over others]] and mass misery. In the aftermath of the end of the [[Cold War]], studies upon moral idealism have often asked if Enlightenment viewpoints face an inherent intellectual challenge that the doctrines cannot eventually overcome.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the advent of the 21st century, philosophizers have debated the rapid evolution of different cultures, particularly given advancing technology, and the seeming acceptance of [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian values]] previously thought of as radical or undesirable by [[Center-left politics|center-left]], [[Political moderation|moderate]], and [[Center-right politics|center-right]] individuals. The conflict between these people, many of them belonging to younger generations such as the [[Millennials]], and those [[Political extremism|political extremists]] of the [[Far-right politics|global far-right movement]], the social trend often called \"[[Neo-nationalism|new nationalism]]\", has defined new distinctions between what it means to be a \"moral idealist\". As well, the question of the fundamental [[Biology|biological]] advancement of humanity itself has attracted much attention. What a [[transhuman]] or even [[posthuman]] individual would possess terms of ideals in contrast with regular human beings has remained an open question.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broadest sense, the question of whether or not humanity as a whole has fundamentally progressed towards a set of moral ideals over time has never achieved any particular consensus. Examples of philosophers who argue partially in support of the notion include the American thinker [[Richard Rorty]], a figure who has criticized the very concept of unchanging ethical principles set forth in inherent nature while still lauding general social progress.<ref name=rorty/> In contrast, multiple scholars concerned with issues such as [[global climate change]] and potential use of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in future [[warfare]] have lamented particular [[Technology|technological advancements]] and related alterations in broader social culture, the thinkers arguing that fundamental moral progress has truly not occurred given forms of increasing danger to humanity.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:TeilhardP 1947.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]], a [[Jesuit]] priest and scientist, wrote that moral progress and [[biological evolution]] would converge to unify all in an idealistic existence with [[God]].<ref name=allen/><ref name=langan/><ref name=salem/>]]\n\nOne optimistic view arising in the 20th century and continuing to receive notice is that of prominent [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] figure [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. He famously predicted that humanity will eventually advance in terms of not just scientific development through natural and engineered [[biological evolution]] but also idealistic morality to a sort of final oneness regarded by him as the '[[Omega Point]]', a mode of existence taking place not only without hatred, pain, and misery but with perfect collective action and consciousness. Known as the \"Catholic Darwin\", his view of evolutionary advancement came out of a religious context through which he identified humanity's final state with Jesus Christ as the \"[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]\" or sacred \"Word\".

In some theories of applied ethics, relative importance has gotten assigned to certain social preferences over others as a way to [[Dispute resolution|resolve disputes effectively]]. In analysis of [[legal theory]], for instance, [[judge]]s have been sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would likely advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of broader [[social equality]], which would likely advise seeking to restore goodwill between individuals regardless of specific findings during a particular case. Said judges have also been required to consider the principle of the [[right to a speedy trial]] as well, which places limits on the previous two ideals given the time involved in ferreting out details.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn an August 2005 address, philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] remarked upon the \"moral idealism common to Platonism, Judaism, and Christianity\" and the related notion of strictly specified principles through the lens of applied ethics, asserting to a group of business professionals,\n{{quote|\"[I]ndividuals become aware of more alternatives, and therefore wiser, as they grow older.

Specifically, certain authors known as \"[[New atheism|new atheists]]\" such as biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] and journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]] have argued that newly emerging forms of [[secular ethics]] constitute an approach of people treating each other that is more logical, just, and reasonable when seen as a rejoinder to previous forms of \"traditional values\". At the same time, multiple thinkers have advocated for moral relativism and a reduced or non-existent sense of holding to previously well-promoted ideals as a direct result of their wholesale rejection of religion. As well, scholars regardless of personal faith background have commented about the complex nature of ethics when taken from spiritual movements.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Idealistic appeals in practice==\n===In conceptual and historical politics===\n\n[[File:Pericles.jpg|thumb|right|Greek statesman [[Pericles]]' vision of [[Athenian democracy]] stressed a sense of what he saw as core ideals, particularly the intelligence and tolerance displayed by Athenians.<ref name=pericles/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdeals have played a role in [[politics]] for [[millennia]]. For example, iconic Greek statesman [[Pericles]] famously presented an ideal-based view of the [[Mediterranean]] world. In 431, shortly after the [[Peloponnesian War]] had started, Pericles' \"Funeral Oration\" made to commemorate fallen soldiers, described for posterity by the historian [[Thucydides]], presented a view of [[Athens]] and the city-state's broader civilization that emphasized a sense of cleverness and open-mindedness that Pericles believed gave it the strength to rise to different challenges.<ref name=pericles>{{citenews|journal=[[Pbs.org]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/36.html|title=Pericles Funeral Oration in Depth|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Other early historical figures known for appealing to ethical ideals in their [[Public speaking|oratory]] include Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]], the figure's commentary on [[Hellenic Greece|Hellenized]] values leading to his moral appeal among supporters. In contrast to what he saw as [[decadence]] spreading into [[Rome]] and nearby areas from elsewhere, Cato articulated support for what he labeled as traditional Roman ethics.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost [[Revolution|political revolutions]] have drawn support from the mass appeal of a certain moral idealism in contrast to the doctrines of those holding [[Power (sociology)|power]], having the various grievances with the status quo created from real or perceived misrule spark ethical debate. During the [[French Revolution]], the rhetorical principles of ''\"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\"'' (English: ''\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\"'') got raised to the status of clear-cut ideals; the new [[nation state]] constituted a sort of grand experiment in what became in de facto and later de jure a new religion. Many political movements in modern times have centered themselves upon multiple ideals found to be mutually reinforcing. Recent examples have included the [[peace movement]] and the broader opposition expressed worldwide to war in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] as well as elsewhere.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn many cases current and historical, instances have popped up in which proclaimed ideals simply weren't lived up to by various figures while in office, despite claims made by the officials before taking power and since attaining it. In [[British English]], politicians openly changing their opinions in defiance of previous assertions about their ethics have been labeled as making a \"u-turn\". In [[American English]], similar individuals have been pejoratively called \"flip-floppers\". While different, the terms [[U-turn (politics)|have meant the same thing]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdealism in the context of politics has attracted criticism from multiple fronts. For instance, U.S. philosopher [[Gerald Gaus]], the author of ''[[The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society]]'', has prominently argued that an overriding emphasis on ideals causes individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy as well as logical choices during [[Election|elections]]. Gaus has made other warnings such as cautioning that people can lose their sense of how much has already been achieved and how well current situations have become in certain circumstances.

In [[Islam]], for instance, the life of the prophet [[Muhammad]] has been held up as a comprehensive ideal for Muslims to study. However, all of his words and deeds must be interpreted for believers through the lens of his life's broader path and the larger religious context, according to Islamic scholars.

The general field of [[anthropology]] has studied the evolution of differing societies and come to contradictory conclusions about whether or not certain ideals can be said to be innate to human existence and/or universal in terms of rational advocacy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nEmpirical research has demonstrated differences between [[Man|men]] and [[Woman|women]] in terms of their relative approaches to idealistic morality. Specifically, a 2018 report published in the ''International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration'' stated that six scholarly studies published in the past had determined that women value ethical principles at a higher level than men in the context of [[business]] and [[economics]]. However, some of those had found only modest differences.

In depth, the analysis of eight different European nations, constituting of [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovakia]], and [[Poland]], appeared to the researchers to have illustrated the effects of contrasting social mores. For example, [[Culture of Croatia|Croatian culture]] faced the problem that \"[t]he significant majority of employees are satisfied with the minimum level of ethical behavior\" while the [[Finnish people|Finns]] were labeled as living in a \"traditionally seen... corruption-free or low-corruption and transparent country\".<ref name=poor/> As well, a 2008 report published in the ''Journal of Business Ethics'' concluded that \"levels of idealism... vary across regions of the world in predictable ways\" such that a nation's ethical \"position predicted that country's location on previously documented cultural dimensions, such as individualism and avoidance of uncertainty\".<ref>{{citejournal|title=East Meets West: A Meta-Analytic Investigation of Cultural Variations in Idealism and Relativism|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|doi=10.1007/s10551-008-9667-6|date=2008|volume=83|pages=813\u2013833|first1=Donelson R.|last1=Forsyth|first2=Ernest H.|last2=O'Boyle, Jr.|first3=Michael A.|last3=McDaniel}}</ref>\n\nStudies have additionally evaluated differences based on varying [[Human generation|generations]] in terms of their ethical idealism. In contrast to only finding slight differences in terms of idealism by sex, the aforementioned ''International Journal of Management Science and Business Administration'' study concluded that particular gaps exist between generations; broadly speaking, the older an individual was, the more importance they gave to idealistic ethics according to the analysis.<ref name=poor/>\n\n===Ideals versus absolute or conditional obligations===\n\n[[File:Blood test (1).jpg|thumb|right|Obligated social standards, such as the various [[Social norms|norms]] around the [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|medical professional and patient relationship]], have been argued by thinkers as existing at a different plane than idealistic moral views.<ref name=norbert/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nPhilosopher [[Norbert Paulo]] has stated that, in common life, ideals as such appear to exist in relation to general social obligations. Many of the latter concepts have tended to appear, according to Paulo, absolute and essentially mandatory while also existing in highly particular circumstances. For instance, Paulo has written, [[Physician|physicians]] and [[Nursing|nurses]] face a variety of [[Doctor\u2013patient relationship|ethical obligations imposed on them when treating their patients]] that regular individuals encountering said patients randomly do not. He had added that a continuum exists between clear-cut, widely held obligations applied via [[Social norm|social norms]] and vague ones only partially behold to cultural sanction.<ref name=norbert/>\n\nPaulo's argument, thus, has concluded that idealist behavior takes place at a behavioral and mental level above and beyond mere social rules, such actions being \"warranted\" yet \"not strictly required\" either while their optional nature sets them up as being \"praiseworthy\". Ideals represent a method of putting into action an individual's [[personal character]] and its given traits such that, Paulo has argued, moral standards get fleshed out beyond the rigid framework of mere obligations. One person's altruistic caring for another generally has constituted a particular example.<ref name=norbert/>\n\n===Ideals versus virtues===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe line between an ideal and a [[virtue]] has been difficult to access. Ideals have been argued to inherently involve aspirations while virtues function as direct guides for assigned conduct given social standards.<ref name=norbert/> Analysis has run into problems given that both entities are [[fuzzy concept]]s. In general, some philosophers have argued that an ideal usually constitutes something more inherent that one can make a [[Habituation|habit]] while virtues, instead, necessarily involve going above and beyond regular decision making in order to actively strive for something. Thus, these thinkers have stated, virtues inherently constitute a behavior that's by its very nature highly difficult to turn into a regular practice. Other philosophers have made the exact opposite argument and seen virtues as fundamentally philosophically weaker entities than ideals.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nGiven the complexity of putting ideals into practice, not to mention resolving conflicts between them, many individuals have chosen to narrowly pick a certain group of them and then harden them into absolute [[dogma]]. Political theorist [[Bernard Crick]] has stated that a way to solve this [[dilemma]] is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a generalized process rather than a specific outcome, particularly when the latter is hard to achieve.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nKant wrote in his work ''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View'' pitting idealism against the enactment of personal [[vice]], the philospher arguing,\n{{quote|\"Young man! Deny yourself satisfaction (of amusement, of debauchery, of love, etc.), not with the Stoical intention of complete abstinence, but with the refined Epicurean intention of having in view an ever-growing pleasure. This stinginess with the cash of your vital urge makes you definitely richer through the postponement of pleasure, even if you should, for the most part, renounce the indulgence of it until the end of your life. The awareness of having pleasure under your control is, like everything idealistic, more fruitful and more abundant than everything that satisfies the sense through indulgence because it is thereby simultaneously consumed and consequently lost from the aggregate of totality.\"<ref name=anthropology>{{citebook|title=[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]|authorlink=Immanuel Kant|first=Immanuel|last=Kant|date=1996|translator=Victor Lyle Dowdell|publisher=[[Southern Illinois University Press]]|ISBN=9780809320608}}</ref>}}\n\n===Relative ideals===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Robert S. Hartman]] has contended that since, colloquially, labeling an entity as ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class, thus the term has particular implications when used in an ethical context. For example, he has stated, the ideal student constitutes the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles. Since one can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, according to Hartman, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is to Hartman. Thus, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is worse than a very smooth one drawn with a compass' aid, but both are better than a regularly made square.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor Hartman, the world in general has presented a situation in which each particular entity ought usually to become more like its ideal if possible. This entails that, in [[ethics]], each individual should analogously to become more like the hypothetical ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self, in Hartman's view.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Totalizing ideals versus emergent ideals===\n\n[[File:Terry Eagleton in Manchester 2008.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[Terry Eagleton]] has written critically about the practicality of ethical idealism.<ref name=terry/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe question of to what extent one can hold to certain ideals practically and how facing resistance will shape them has attracted debate from multiple thinkers. The related issue of to what extent idealistic morality held by individuals reflects broader cultures has done so as well. The extent to which human beings think through their behavior irrationally or rationally has been a major issue in these such discussions.<ref name=kelly/><ref name=terry/>\n\nOne 21st century philosopher who has delved into the topics is [[Terry Eagleton]]. Writing in his book ''After Theory'', he has commented critically about the practicality of ethical idealism, Eagleton arguing,\n{{quote|\"Moral values which state what you ought to do are impressively idealistic, but too blatantly at odds with your behaviour. Moral values\nwhich reflect what you actually do are far more plausible, but only at the cost of no longer serving to legitimate your activity.\"<ref name=terry>{{citebook|date=2004|authorlink=Terry Eagleton||title=After Theory|publisher=[[Penguin Publishing]]|pages=151-152|ISBN=9780141927886|first=Terry|last=Eagleton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3N6zL1qyHQC}}</ref>}}\n\nAnother 21st century philosopher who has questioned traditional understandings of idealistic morality is [[Kwame Anthony Appiah]]. In particular, his book ''As If: Idealization and Ideals'' examined the usefulness of the concepts and the processes through which they've been articulated. Appiah found fault in the general assumptions made by certain thinkers of human rationality and advocated for a larger understanding of the practical nature of the idealization process among scholars of multiple disciplines as well as laypeople.<ref name=kelly/>\n\nIn depth, Appiah's book presented a nuanced picture of ethical idealism in the context of cultural organization, the philosopher writing,\n{{quote|\"The history of our collective moral learning doesn't start with the growing acceptance of a picture of an ideal society.

While the titular inquisitor rationally argues for the relativist view that people seek safety and security over higher callings, Christ surprisingly kisses the aged, emotionally distant leader on the lips; while still holding to his views, the moved inquisitor allows Christ to leave freely.

As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.\n\nThe route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north\u2013south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east\u2013west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.\n\nBefore the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.\n\nExpansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.\n\n==System details==\n{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}\n\nIn general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>\n\nExcept for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s.

Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.\n\nIn the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase.

Often, the shield is displayed against a black square or rectangular background.  Each state manufactures their own signage, and as such subtle variations exist all across the United States.  Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nSecretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.  Six regional meetings were held to hammer out the details\u2014May 15 for the [[West (US)|West]], May 27 for the [[Mississippi Valley]], June 3 for the [[Great Lakes]], June 8 for the [[South (US)|South]], June 15 for the [[Atlantic Northeast|North Atlantic]], and June 15<!--typo?--> for [[New England]].  Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;\u2014 maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|direction= horizontal\n|width= 100\n|image1= US 32 Iowa 1926.svg\n|alt1= US 32 Iowa 1926 shield marker\n|image2= US 28 Oregon 1948.svg\n|alt2= US 28 Oregon 1948 shield marker\n|footer= 1926 and 1948 versions of the [[U.S. Route shield]]\n}}\nThe second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east\u2013west and ten major north\u2013south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nAfter working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement and refinement, 1925\u201326===\n[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]\n\nThe new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14\u201315, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nIn the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nMany local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as\u2014for instance\u2014US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north\u2013south than west\u2013east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object\u2014Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.\n\nWith 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n===Expansion and adjustment, 1926\u201356===\n[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]\n\nWhen the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.\n\nIn 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n\nFor the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]].

By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]].

As the designation and numbering of these highways were coordinated among the states, they are sometimes called '''Federal Highways''', but the roadways were built and have always been maintained by [[State governments of the United States|state]] or [[Local government in the United States|local governments]] since their initial designation in 1926.\n\nThe route numbers and locations are coordinated by the [[American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials]] (AASHTO).<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\"/> The only federal involvement in AASHTO is a nonvoting seat for the [[United States Department of Transportation]].<!-- The Interstate Highway System has a different numbering scheme with different directions. Do not confuse the two and change the following information. --> Generally, most north-to-south highways are odd-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the east, and the highest in the west. Similarly, east-to-west highways are typically even-numbered, with the lowest numbers in the north, and the highest in the south. Some exceptions exist, however, such as spur routes. Major north\u2013south routes have numbers ending in \"1\" or \"5\", while major east\u2013west routes have numbers ending in \"0\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\" /> Three-digit numbered highways are generally spur routes of parent highways (thus [[U.S. Route 264]] [US&nbsp;264] is a spur off [[U.S. Route 64|US&nbsp;64]]). Some [[List of divided U.S. Routes|divided routes]] (such as [[U.S. Route 19E|US&nbsp;19E]] and [[U.S. Route 19W|US&nbsp;19W]]) exist to provide two alignments for one route. Special routes, which can be labeled as alternate, bypass or business, depending on the intended use, provide a parallel routing to the mainline U.S. Highway.\n\nBefore the U.S. Routes were designated, [[auto trail]]s designated by auto trail associations were the main means of marking roads through the United States.  In 1925, the '''Joint Board on Interstate Highways''', recommended by the [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), worked to form a national numbering system to rationalize the roads. After several meetings, a final report was approved by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|U.S. Department of Agriculture]] in November 1925. They received complaints from across the country about the assignment of routes, so the board made several modifications; the U.S. Highway System was approved on November 11, 1926. As a result of compromises made to get the U.S. Highway System approved, many routes were divided, with alignments to serve different towns. In subsequent years, AASHTO called for such splits to be eliminated.\n\nExpansion of the U.S. Highway System continued until 1956, when the [[Interstate Highway System]] was laid out and began construction under the administration of President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]. After construction was completed, many U.S. Routes were replaced by Interstate Highways for through traffic. Despite the Interstate System, U.S. Highways still form many important regional connections, and new routes are still being added.\n\n==System details==\n{{See also|List of United States Numbered Highways}}\n\nIn general, U.S. Routes do not have a minimum design standard, unlike the later [[Interstate Highway]]s, and are not usually built to [[freeway]] standards. Some stretches of U.S. Routes do meet those standards. Many are designated using the [[main street]]s of the cities and towns through which they run. New additions to the system, however, must \"substantially meet the current [[AASHTO design standards]]\".<ref name=\"AASHTO purpose\">{{cite web |url=http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |title=Establishment and Development of United States Numbered Highways |date=January 2000 |author=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher=AASHTO |format=PDF |work=AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |authorlink=American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |accessdate=January 16, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022063759/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO1_Policy_Establ_Develop_USRN.pdf |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> As of 1989, the United States Numbered Highways system had a total length of {{convert|157724|mi|km}}.<ref name=USRN/>\n\nExcept for [[toll bridge]]s and [[toll tunnel|tunnels]], very few U.S. Routes are [[toll road]]s.

Usually, one- and two-digit routes are major routes, and three-digit routes are numbered as shorter spur routes from a main route (with some exceptions such as [[US 151]], which is a main line highway). Odd numbers generally increase from east to west; [[U.S. Route 1]] (US&nbsp;1) follows the Atlantic Coast and [[U.S. Route 101|US&nbsp;101]] follows the Pacific Coast. (US 101 is one of the many exceptions to the standard numbering grid; its first \"digit\" is \"10\", and it is a main route on its own and not a spur of US 1.) Even numbers tend to increase from north to south; [[U.S. Route 2|US&nbsp;2]] closely follows the Canadian border, and [[U.S. Route 98|US&nbsp;98]] hugs the Gulf Coast. The longest routes connecting major cities are generally numbered to end in a 1 or a 0,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/longest.cfm |title=Ask the Rambler: What Is The Longest Road in the United States? |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date= April 7, 2011 |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}</ref> however extensions and truncations have made this distinction largely meaningless. <ref name=\"mcnichol71\">{{cite book |last=McNichol |first=Dan |title=The Roads that Built America: The Incredible Story of the US Interstate System |location=New York |publisher=Sterling Publishing |year=2006 |isbn= 1-4027-3468-9|ref=harv |page=71}}</ref>  These guidelines are very rough, and exceptions to all of the basic numbering rules exist all over the U.S. and are too numerous to list.\n\nIn the 1950s, the numbering grid for the new Interstate Highway System was established as intentionally opposite from the US grid insofar as the direction the route numbers increase. Interstate Highway numbers increase from west-to-east and south-to-north, to keep identically numbered routes geographically apart in order to keep them from being confused with one another,<ref name=\"mcnichol71\"/> and it omits 50 and 60 which would potentially conflict with [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] and [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]].<ref group=lower-alpha>Exceptions to this rule do occur.</ref>\n\nIn the US Highway system, three-digit numbers are assigned to spurs of one or two-digit routes. [[U.S. Route 201|US&nbsp;201]], for example, splits from [[U.S. Route 1|US&nbsp;1]] at [[Brunswick, Maine]], and runs north to Canada.<ref name=\"rm\">{{cite map |author= Rand McNally |title=The Road Atlas and Travel Guide |year=2009 |scale= Scale not given |location= Chicago |publisher= Rand McNally |isbn= 978-0-528-94209-9}}</ref>  Not all spurs travel in the same direction as their \"parents\"; some are connected to their parents only by other spurs, or not at all, instead only traveling near their parents, Also, a spur may travel in different cardinal directions than its parent, such as [[U.S. Route 522|US&nbsp;522]], which is a north-south route, unlike its parent [[U.S. Route 22|US&nbsp;22]], which is east-west. As originally assigned, the first digit of the spurs increased from north to south and east to west along the parent; for example, [[U.S. Route 60 (1925)|US&nbsp;60]] had spurs, running from east to west, designated as [[U.S. Route 160 (1925)|US&nbsp;160]] in [[Missouri]], [[U.S. Route 260 (1925)|US&nbsp;260]] in [[Oklahoma]], [[U.S. Route 360 (1925)|US&nbsp;360]] in [[Texas]], and [[U.S. Route 460|US&nbsp;460]] and [[U.S. Route 560 (1925)|US&nbsp;560]] in [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"1925 list\"/>  As with the two-digit routes, three-digit routes have been added, removed, extended and shortened; the \"parent-child\" relationship is not always present.<ref name=\"rm\"/><ref name=\"esso\">{{cite map |author1=[[Esso]] |title=United States Featuring the Interstate Highway System |year=1966 |author2=[[General Drafting]] |last-author-amp= yes |scale= [c. 1:3,870,000] |location= Convent Station, NJ |publisher= General Drafting |oclc= 749860157}}</ref>\n\nAASHTO guidelines specifically prohibit [[Interstate Highway]]s and U.S. Routes from sharing a number within the same state.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |format= PDF |title= Establishment of a Marking System of the Routes Comprising the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways |author= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |publisher= American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials |date= January 2000 |work= AASHTO Transportation Policy Book |accessdate= December 31, 2013 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140101011142/http://route.transportation.org/Documents/HO2_Policy_Retention_HO1.pdf |archivedate= January 1, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> As with other guidelines, exceptions exist across the U.S.  <ref name=\"esso\"/>\n\nSome two-digit numbers have never been applied to any U.S. Route, including 39, 47, 86 and 88.\n\n===Signage===\nRoute numbers are displayed on a distinctively-shaped white shield with large black numerals in the center.

Individual states may use cut-out or rectangular designs, some have black outlines, and California prints the letters \"US\" above the numerals.  One- and two-digit shields generally feature the same large, bold numerals on a square-dimension shield, while 3-digit routes may either use the same shield with a narrower font, or a wider rectangular-dimension shield.  Special routes may be indicated with a banner above the route number, or with a letter suffixed to the route number.  Signs are generally displayed in several different locations.  First, they are shown along the side of the route at regular intervals or after major intersections (called [[reassurance marker]]s), which shows the route and the nominal direction of travel.  Second, they are displayed at intersections with other major roads, so that intersecting traffic can follow their chosen course.  Third, they can be displayed on large green [[Road_signs_in_the_United_States#Guide|guide signs]] that indicate upcoming interchanges on freeways and expressways.\n\n<gallery caption = \"Various U.S. highway sign designs\">\nFile:US 64.svg|Most commonly used one- or two-digit variant, standard shield on a black square\nFile:US 302 square.svg|Three-digit variant, square proportions and thin font\nFile:US 180.svg|Three-digit variant, rectangular proportions and standard font\nFile:US 40 (1948).svg|Outline variant\nFile:US 95 (1961 cutout).svg|California variant, with US at top and black outline\nFile:US 92 (FL).svg|Florida variant, in color, now retired\nFile:US 101 California 1926.svg|Historic design, with state name and US on shield, block-style font, now retired\nFile:US 14A.svg|Alternate route, with full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 62B.svg|Business route, with small letter suffix\nFile:US 64-A.svg|Alternate route, with hyphen and full-size letter suffix\nFile:US 1 Bypass.svg|Bypass route, with \"BY-PASS\" written in the shield\nFile:US 129 Alternate.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in the shield\nFile:US 50 Alt.svg|Alternate route, with \"ALT\" written in a banner above shield\nFile:US 87 Business.svg|Business route, with \"BUSINESS\" written in a banner above shield\n</gallery>\n\n===Divided and special routes===\n{{Main|List of divided U.S. Routes|List of special routes of the United States Numbered Highway System}}\n\nSince 1926, some divided routes were designated to serve related areas, and designate roughly-equivalent splits of routes.

The [[Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921 (Phipps Act)|Federal Aid Highway Act of 1921]] limited the routes to 7% of each state's roads, while 3 in every 7 roads had to be \"interstate in character\".  Identification of these main roads was completed in 1923.<!--anyone got a map of them?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] (AASHO), formed in 1914 to help establish roadway standards, began to plan a system of marked and numbered \"interstate highways\" at its 1924 meeting.<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=67}}</ref> AASHO recommended that the [[Secretary of Agriculture (US)|Secretary of Agriculture]] work with the states to designate these routes.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nSecretary [[Howard M. Gore]] appointed the ''Joint Board on Interstate Highways'', as recommended by AASHO, on March 2, 1925.  The Board was composed of 21 state highway officials and three federal [[Bureau of Public Roads]] officials.  At the first meeting, on April 20 and 21, the group chose the name \"U.S. Highway\" as the designation for the routes. They decided that the system would not be limited to the federal-aid network; if the best route did not receive federal funds, it would still be included.  The tentative design for the [[U.S. Highway shield]] was also chosen,<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=121}}</ref> based on the shield found on the [[Great Seal of the United States]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe auto trail associations rejected the elimination of the highway names.

Representatives of the auto trail associations were not able to formally address the meetings.  However, as a compromise, they talked with the Joint Board members. The associations finally settled on a general agreement with the numbering plans, as named trails would still be included.<!--could be worded better-->  The tentative system added up to 81,000 miles (130,000&nbsp;km), 2.8% of the public road mileage at the time.<!--seems high even then&nbsp;\u2014 maybe state highways only?--><ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n{{multiple image\n|align= right\n|direction= horizontal\n|width= 100\n|image1= US 32 Iowa 1926.svg\n|alt1= US 32 Iowa 1926 shield marker\n|image2= US 28 Oregon 1948.svg\n|alt2= US 28 Oregon 1948 shield marker\n|footer= 1926 and 1948 versions of the [[U.S. Route shield]]\n}}\nThe second full meeting was held August 3 and 4, 1925.  At that meeting, discussion was held over the appropriate density of routes. [[William F. Williams]] of [[Massachusetts]] and [[Frederick S. Greene]] of New York favored a system of only major transcontinental highways, while many states recommended a large number of roads of only regional importance.  Greene in particular intended New York's system to have four major through routes<!--2 and 4 ended at 9, he wanted 109 gone--> as an example to the other states.  Many states agreed in general with the scope of the system, but believed the [[Midwest (US)|Midwest]] to have added too many routes to the system.  The group adopted the shield, with few modifications from the original sketch, at that meeting, as well as the decision to number rather than name the routes.  A preliminary numbering system, with eight major east\u2013west and ten major north\u2013south routes, was deferred to a numbering committee \"without instructions\".<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nAfter working with states to get their approval, the committee expanded the highway system to 75,800 miles (122,000&nbsp;km), or 2.6% of total mileage, over 50% more than the plan approved August 4.  The skeleton of the numbering plan was suggested on August 27 by [[Edwin Warley James]] of the BPR, who matched [[parity (number)|parity]] to direction, and laid out a rough grid.  Major routes from the earlier map were assigned numbers ending in 0, 1 or 5 (5 was soon relegated to less-major status), and short connections received three-digit numbers based on the main highway from which they spurred.  The five-man committee met September 25, and submitted the final report to the Joint Board secretary on October 26.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  The board sent the report to the Secretary of Agriculture of October 30, and he approved it November 18, 1925.<ref name=\"1925 list\">{{cite book |type= Report |author = Joint Board on Interstate Highways |year = 1925 |url = https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Report_of_Joint_Board_on_Interstate_Highways_October_30,_1925 |title = Report of Joint Board on Interstate Highways, October 30, 1925, Approved by the Secretary of Agriculture, November 18, 1925 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Department of Agriculture]] |id= {{OCLC|733875457|55123355|71026428}} |via = [[Wikisource]] |access-date = November 14, 2017 }}</ref>\n\n===Disagreement and refinement, 1925\u201326===\n[[File: United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials.jpg|thumb|The \"final\" U.S. Highway plan as approved November 11, 1926]]\n\nThe new system was both praised and criticized by local newspapers, often depending on whether that city was connected to a major route.  While the [[Lincoln Highway Association]] understood and supported the plan, partly because they were assured of getting the [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] designation as much as possible, most other trail associations lamented their obsolescence.  At their January 14\u201315, 1926 meeting, AASHO was flooded with complaints.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nIn the Northeast, New York held out for fewer routes designated as US highways. The Pennsylvania representative, who had not attended the local meetings, convinced AASHO to add a dense network of routes, which had the effect of giving six routes termini along the state line.  (Only [[U.S. Route 220|US&nbsp;220]] still ends near the state line, and now it ends at an intersection with future [[Interstate 86 in New York|I-86]].)  Because [[U.S. Route 20|US&nbsp;20]] seemed indirect, passing through [[Yellowstone National Park]], [[Idaho]] and [[Oregon]] requested that [[U.S. Route 30|US&nbsp;30]] be swapped with US&nbsp;20 to the [[Pacific coast]].<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nMany local disputes arose related to the committee's choices between designation of two roughly equal parallel routes, which were often competing auto trails.  At their January meeting, AASHO approved the first two of many split routes (specifically [[U.S. Route 40|US&nbsp;40]] between [[Manhattan, Kansas]] and [[Limon, Colorado]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]] between [[Baldwin City, Kansas]] and [[Garden City, Kansas]]).  In effect, each of the two routes received the same number, with a directional suffix indicating its relation to the other.  These splits were initially shown in the log as\u2014for instance\u2014US&nbsp;40 North and US&nbsp;40 South, but were always posted as simply US&nbsp;40N and US&nbsp;40S.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\nThe most heated argument, however, was the issue of US&nbsp;60.  The Joint Board had assigned that number to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, which ran more north\u2013south than west\u2013east in Illinois, and then angled sharply to the southwest to [[Oklahoma City]], from where it ran west to [[Los Angeles]]. [[Kentucky]] strongly objected to this designated route, as it had been left off any of the major east-west routes, instead receiving the [[U.S. Route 62 (1925)|US&nbsp;62]] designation. In January 1926, the committee designated this, along with the part of [[U.S. Route 52|US&nbsp;52]] east of [[Ashland, Kentucky]], as [[U.S. Route 60|US&nbsp;60]]. They assigned US&nbsp;62 to the Chicago-Los Angeles route, contingent on the approval of the states along the former US&nbsp;60.  But Missouri and Oklahoma did object\u2014Missouri had already printed maps, and Oklahoma had prepared signs.  A compromise was proposed, in which US&nbsp;60 would split at [[Springfield, Missouri]], into US&nbsp;60E and US&nbsp;60N, but both sides objected.  The final solution resulted in the assignment of [[U.S. Route 66|US&nbsp;66]] to the Chicago-Los Angeles portion of the US highway, which did not end in zero, but was still seen as a satisfyingly round number.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/> Route 66 came to have a prominent place in popular culture, being featured in song and films.\n\nWith 32&nbsp;states already marking their routes, the plan was approved by AASHO on November 11, 1926.<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>  This plan included a number of directionally split routes, several discontinuous routes (including [[U.S. Route 6|US&nbsp;6]], [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]] and [[U.S. Route 50|US&nbsp;50]]), and some termini at state lines.<ref name=\"1926 map\">{{cite map |author1= [[Bureau of Public Roads]] |author2= [[American Association of State Highway Officials]] |date= November 11, 1926 |title= United States System of Highways Adopted for Uniform Marking by the American Association of State Highway Officials |url= https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:United_States_System_of_Highways_Adopted_for_Uniform_Marking_by_the_American_Association_of_State_Highway_Officials.jpg |scale= 1:7,000,000 |location= Washington, DC |publisher= [[United States Geological Survey]] |oclc= 32889555 |accessdate= November 7, 2013 |via= [[Wikimedia Commons]] |last-author-amp= yes}}</ref>  By the time the first route log was published in April 1927, major numbering changes had been made in Pennsylvania in order to align the routes to the existing auto trails.<ref name=\"FHWA PA\">{{cite web |last= Weingroff |first=Richard F. |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/us22.cfm |title=US&nbsp;22: The William Penn Highway |publisher=Federal Highway Administration |work=Highway History |date=April 7, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref> In addition, [[U.S. Route 15]] had been extended across [[Virginia]].<ref name=\"1927 log\">{{cite journal |title=United States Numbered Highways |journal=[[American Highways]] |publisher=American Association of State Highway Officials |date=April 1927 |issn= 0002-8746}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the early criticism of the U.S. Highway System focused on the choice of numbers to designate the highways, rather than names.  Some thought a numbered highway system to be cold  compared to the more colorful names and historic value of the auto trail systems.  ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, \"The traveler may shed tears as he drives the [[Lincoln Highway]] or dream dreams as he speeds over the [[Jefferson Highway]], but how can he get a 'kick' out of 46, 55 or 33 or 21?\"<ref>{{harvp|ps=.|McNichol|2006|p=78}}</ref> (A popular song later promised, \"Get your kicks on Route 66!\") The writer [[Ernest McGaffey]] was quoted as saying, \"Logarithms will take the place of legends, and 'hokum' for history.\"<ref name=\"FHWA planning\"/>\n\n===Expansion and adjustment, 1926\u201356===\n[[File:Highway Sign.jpg|thumb|This sign, photographed in 1941 on US&nbsp;99 between [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]], and [[Portland, Oregon]], illustrates one rationale for a federal highway system: national defense.]]\n\nWhen the U.S. numbered system was started in 1925, a few optional routings were established which were designated with a suffixed letter after the number indicating \"north\", \"south\", \"east\", or \"west\". While a few roads in the system are still numbered in this manner, AASHO believes that they should be eliminated wherever possible, by the absorption of one of the optional routes into another route.\n\nIn 1934, AASHO tried to eliminate many of the split routes by removing them from the log, and designating one of each pair as a three-digit or alternate route, or in one case [[U.S. Route 37|US&nbsp;37]]. AASHO described its renumbering concept in the October 1934 issue of ''[[American Highways]]'':<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n<blockquote>\"Wherever an alternate route is not suitable for its own unique two-digit designation, standard procedure assigns the unqualified number to the older or shorter route, while the other route uses the same number marked by a standard strip above its shield carrying the word 'Alternate'.\"</blockquote>Most states adhere to this approach. However, some maintain legacy routes that violate the rules in various ways.  Examples can be found in [[California]], [[Mississippi]], [[Nebraska]], [[Oregon]], and [[Tennessee]]. In 1952, AASHO permanently recognized the splits in [[U.S. Route 11|US&nbsp;11]],<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/> [[U.S. Route 19|US&nbsp;19]], [[U.S. Route 25|US&nbsp;25]], [[U.S. Route 31|US&nbsp;31]], [[U.S. Route 45|US&nbsp;45]], [[U.S. Route 49|US&nbsp;49]], [[U.S. Route 73|US&nbsp;73]], and [[U.S. Route 99|US&nbsp;99]].<ref name=\"FHWA US 11\"/>\n\nFor the most part, the U.S. Routes were the primary means of inter-city vehicle travel; the main exceptions were [[toll road]]s such as the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] and [[parkway]] routes such as the [[Merritt Parkway]].

By 1957, AASHO had decided to assign a new grid to the new routes, to be numbered in the opposite directions as the U.S. Highway grid. Though the Interstate numbers were to supplement, rather than replace, the U.S. Route numbers, in many cases (especially in the [[West (US)|west]]) the US highways were rerouted along the new Interstates.<ref name=\"esso\"/> Major decommissioning of former routes began with [[California]]'s [[1964 renumbering (California)|highway renumbering in 1964]].
