Typically performed at slow and medium speeds, it is capable of inducing moods of devotion, pathos and sadness in the listeners. ''K\u0101pi'' is different from the [[Hindustani music|Hindustani]] [[R\u0101ga|raag]] and [[thaat]] ''[[Kafi]].'' The equivalent raag in Hindustani is [[Pilu]]\n\n==Structure and Lakshana==\n\nK\u0101pi is an '''audava-vakra sampoorna''' r\u0101gam with an ascending pentatonic scale and a descending scale with seven notes, but not in a descending order.

Typically performed at slow and medium speeds, it is capable of inducing moods of devotion, pathos and sadness in the listeners. ''K\u0101pi'' is different from the [[Hindustani music|Hindustani]] [[R\u0101ga|raag]] and [[thaat]] ''[[Kafi]].'' The equivalent raag in Hindustani is [[Pilu]]\n\n==Structure and Lakshana==\n\nK\u0101pi is an '''audava-vakra sampoorna''' r\u0101gam with an ascending pentatonic scale and a descending scale with seven notes, but not in a descending order. Use of [[Kakali Nishadam]] and [[Anthara Gandharam]] make it a [[Bhashanga Raagam]].\n\n*[[Arohana|{{IAST|\u0101roha\u1e47a}}]] : {{svaraC|S|R2|M1|P|N3|S'|foot=yes}}\n*[[Avarohana|{{IAST|avaroha\u1e47a}}]] :  {{svaraC|S'|N2|D2|N2|P|M1|G2|R2|S|foot=yes}}\n\nThe presence of different ''nish\u0101da'' swar\u0101s (N<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>3</sub>) lends a distinctive quality to K\u0101pi, along with the fact that it uses a set of vakra swar\u0101s (N<sub>2</sub> D<sub>2</sub> N<sub>2</sub>).\n\nThere is also a mild presence of shuddha daivatham (D<sub>1</sub>) that renders an invaluable feeling of devotion to the raagam.\nThis, and the presence of [[Anthara Gandharam]] (G<sub>3</sub>) makes it difficult to pinpoint the exact nature of the avarohana of the raagam.\n\n==Compositions==\n\nSome of the popular compositions in K\u0101pi are:\n\n* ''Jagadoddh\u0101rana Adisidaleshodaa''' - [[Purandaradasa]]\n* ''Mee Valla Gunadosha mEmi'' - [[Thyagaraja]]\n* ''Intha Sowkhya'' - [[Thyagaraja]]\n* ''Viharamanasa Rame'', ''Smarasi Pura'', ''Sree Madhavamanu'' - [[Swathi Thirunal]]\n* ''Enna thavam seydanai Yashoda'' - [[Papanasam Sivan]]\n* ''Bhaja maadhavam anisham'' - [[Mysore Vasudevacharya]]\n* ''Maya Gopabala'' - [[K C Kesava Pillai]]\n* ''Jaanaki ramana dasaratha nandana'' - [[Vanamaamalia Jiyar Swami]]\n* ''Javo Mat Thum'' (Upaakhyanam) - [[Swathi Thirunal]]\n* ''Chinnanchiru Kiliye'' - [[Subramanya Bharathi]] - (Beginning-two stanzas)\n* ''Kurai Ondrum Illai'' (in two ''charanam'' verses) - [[Chakravarti Rajagopalachari]]\n* ''Karthikeyanai'' - [[Mayuram Viswanatha Sastri]]\n* \u2018\u2019 aravinda padamalar\u201d - [[Ambujam Krishna]]\n* ''Charanamule Nammiti'' - [[Kancherla Gopanna|Bhadrachala Ramadasu]]\n* ''Kanaka Simham'' - [[Kalyani Varadarajan]]\n*''Kanna Vaa Manivanna Vaa'' (First two verses)- [[Ambujam Krishna]]\n* 'Nee mattume en nenjil nirkirai'-by Perumal Murugan and Vid.

It is mostly spoken at [[Kalkaringi]] and [[Daguragu, Northern Territory|Daguragu]] which are Aboriginal communities located on the traditional lands of the Gurindji. Related mixed varieties are spoken to the north by [[Ngarinyman]] and [[Bilinarra]] people at [[Yarralin]] and [[Pigeon Hole, Northern Territory|Pigeon Hole]]. These varieties are similar to Gurindji Kriol, but draw on Ngarinyman and Bilinarra which are closely related to Gurindji (Eastern Ngumpin languages).\n\nGurindji Kriol emerged in the 1970s from pervasive code-switching practices. It combines the lexicon and structure of Gurindji and Kriol. [[Gurindji language|Gurindji]] is a highly endangered language of the [[Ngumpin-Yapa languages|Ngumpin-Yapa]] subgroup ([[Pama-Nyungan]] family) and [[Australian Kriol language|Kriol]] is an English-lexifier creole language spoken as a first language by most Aboriginal people across northern Australia (with the exception of [[Arnhem Land]] and [[Daly River]] area).\n\nGurindji Kriol exhibits a structural split between the noun phrase and verb phrase, with Gurindji contributing the noun structure including case-marking, and the verb structure including TAM auxiliaries coming from Kriol. In this respect, Gurindji Kriol is classified as a verb-noun (V-N) mixed language. Other examples of V-N mixed languages include [[Michif]] and [[Light Warlpiri]]. The maintenance of Gurindji within the mixed language can be seen as the perpetuation of [[Australian Aboriginal identity|Aboriginal identity]] under massive and continuing cultural incursion.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

From 1855 onwards, the traditional lands of the Gurindji and neighbouring groups were seized by colonists who were searching for good cattle pastures. After initial attempts to cull the original inhabitants, cattle stations were set up and the remaining Gurindji people were brought to work on the stations in slave-like conditions with other Aboriginal groups. In 1966, the Gurindji initiated a workers' strike to protest against their poor conditions of employment and ultimately regain control of their traditional lands. Their campaign was called the [[Wave Hill Walk-off]] and went on for nine years, resulting in the first successful land claim by an Aboriginal group in Australia. Today the Gurindji continue to live on their traditional lands in two main communities - Kalkaringi and Daguragu.<ref>Meakins 2008a and see also [[Frank Hardy]]'s 'The Unlucky Australians' and Deborah Roses' 'Hidden Histories'</ref>\n\nThe linguistic practices of the Gurindji are closely tied to these social circumstances. Before colonisation the Gurindji were multilingual, speaking the languages of neighbouring groups with whom they had familiar and ceremonial connections. The establishment of the cattle stations by colonisers saw the introduction of the cattle station pidgin and later Kriol into the linguistic repertoire of the Gurindji. In the 1970s Patrick McConvell<ref>McConvell's home page: https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/mcconvell-p</ref><ref>see McConvell 1985, 1988</ref> observed that code-switching between Kriol and Gurindji was the dominant language practice of Gurindji people. It is likely that this code-switching and a certain amount of levelling between Gurindji and closely related neighbouring languages such as Ngarinyman and Bilinarra provided fertile ground for the formation of the mixed language. At this time, similar changes to local linguistic ecologies occurred in other places in northern Australia with Kriol becoming the dominant language in many areas such as [[Timber Creek, Northern Territory|Timber Creek]] and Katherine. Yet in Kalkaringi, a mixed language emerged from this situation.<ref>see McConvell and Meakins 2005; McConvell, 2008; Meakins 2011c</ref> [[Felicity Meakins]]<ref>Meakins's home page: http://www.slccs.uq.edu.au//index.html?page=127733&pid=124851</ref><ref>Meakins 2008b:86-87</ref> argues that maintenance of Gurindji elements in the mixed language relates closely to the land rights movement and can be considered an expression of the persistence of their ancestral identity. Additionally McConvell<ref>(McConvell 2007)</ref> suggests that the homogeneity of the linguistic situation (one traditional language spoken at Kalkaringi) may have also aided the maintenance of Gurindji.\n\n==Current linguistic situation==\n\nGurindji Kriol is situated within a complex picture of multilingualism, contact and [[code-switching]]. Gurindji continues to be spoken by older people and a neighbouring traditional Australian language, [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] is also used by people of Warlpiri heritage. [[Standard Australian English]] is the language of government services and the school, though its use is generally restricted to these domains. Kriol and Aboriginal English are spoken with Aboriginal visitors from other communities.<ref>see Meakins 2008b</ref> In this respect, Gurindji Kriol continues to be spoken alongside Gurindji and Kriol, and is a 'symbiotic' [[mixed language]]. In addition, code-switching continues to be an everyday practice at Kalkaringi, and it is common to find code-switching between Gurindji and Kriol, and between Gurindji Kriol and its source languages.\n\n==Lexicon==\n\nLexically there is a mix between Kriol and Gurindji. Despite the verb-noun structural split, some verbs are derived from Kriol and others from Gurindji. Similarly nouns from both languages are present. In general, based on a 200 word [[Swadesh list]], 36.6% of vocabulary is derived from Kriol and 35% finds its origins in Gurindji. The remaining 28.4% are synonymous forms from both languages, where the choice of word depends on a number of factors including the interlocutors. For example, more Gurindji vocabulary is used when addressing older Gurindji people or in the presence of outsiders.<ref>Meakins & O\u2019Shannessy, 2005:45</ref> Some lexical specialisation can be noted, for example ''karnti''  which means \"branch\", \"stick\" or \"tree\" in Gurindji is generally only used to mean \"branch\" or \"stick\" in Gurindji Kriol whereas the Kriol form ''tri''  is used to mean \"tree\".\n\n==Phonology==\n\nThe phonological system of Gurindji Kriol is relatively stratified, i.e. it has maintained separate Gurindji and Kriol phoneme inventories, syllable structures and many phonological processes.<ref>see Jones, Meakins, and Buchan 2011; Jones, Meakins, and Muawiyath to appear</ref>\n\nIn terms of vowels, Gurindji Kriol has a 5 vowel system. All Gurindji words contain only 3 vowel phonemes /\u026a/, /\u0250/ and /\u028a/ with diphthongs the result of combinations of vowels with glides in fast speech, for example /\u0250w/ > [\u0250\u028a]. Kriol words make use of five vowel phonemes /\u025b/ and /\u0254/ in addition to /\u026a/, /\u0250/ and /\u028a/, plus diphthongs and long vowels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|-\n|  || Front || Central || Back\n|-\n| Close || i ||  || u\n|-\n| Mid || e ||  || \u0254\n|-\n| Open ||  || a || \n|}\n\nThe consonant inventory is a complex fusion of Gurindji and Kriol consonants. Words of Gurindji origin contain a three-way coronal contrast for stops, nasals and laterals, and a distinction between a post-alveolar rhotic and an apical trill (sometimes pronounced as a tap). Kriol-derived words contrast with those from Gurindji in containing fricatives. No voicing distinction is made for stops or fricatives in either Gurindji- or Kriol-derived words; voicing depends on position within word or utterance, and place of articulation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|-\n|  || Bilabial   || Alveolar || Post-alveolar || Alveopalatal || Velar  \n|-\n| Stop || p || t || \u0288 || \u025f || k\n|-\n| Fricative || f || s ||  || \u0283 || \n|-\n| Nasal || m || n || \u0273 || \u0272 || \u014b\n|-\n| Lateral ||  || l || \u026d || \u028e || \n|-\n| Rhotic ||  || r, \u0279 || \u027b ||  || \n|-\n| Glide ||  ||  ||  || j || w\n|}\n\nStress is word initial for words of both Gurindji and Kriol origin. The maintenance of the two phonological systems is more obvious in syllable structure. A range of structures are permissible in words of both origins, e.g. CV and CVC, however VC syllables are only allowed in Kriol words. Gurindji and Kriol  source words also diverge in their use of stop-final consonant clusters. Gurindji words allows syllable-final consonant clusters, though the cluster combination is rather restricted. The first consonant must be a liquid and the final consonant, a non-coronal stop or velar nasal. Even in the more acrolectal forms of Kriol words, final consonant clusters are never present at the surface level. Finally different phonological processes apply to the different component languages of Gurindji Kriol. For example, in Kriol words, the plosive series is occasionally hypercorrected to fricatives of a similar place of articulation. This process never occurs in words of Gurindji origin.\n\n==Noun phrase==\n\nThe Gurindji Kriol noun phrase consists of a head plus a number of potential modifiers. Potential heads are: nouns, nominalised adjectives, emphatic pronouns and demonstratives (this/that); and modifiers are determiners (in/definite, plural/singular) and adjectives. Heads and modifiers can be distinguished by their ability to take case marking. Heads are case-marked, and modifiers are not. The order of noun phrase constituents is relatively fixed: DET - MOD - HEAD.  Finally Gurindji Kriol is an optional ergative language where the transitive subject is optionally marked ergative and objects are unmarked.<ref>Meakins 2009; Meakins and O'Shannessy 2010; O'Shannessy and Meakins to appear</ref>\n\n{|\n|-\n| dat || ''yapakayi'' || ''karu-ngku'' || i || bin || gon || ged-im-bat || dat || ''karu''\n|-\n| the || small || child-ERG || 3SG.SBJ || PST || go || get-TR-PROG || the || child\n|}\n\"The small kid goes to get the (other) kid.\"<ref name=\"Meakins, 2012b\">Meakins, 2012b</ref>\n\n(Note that in all examples Gurindji-derived words are italicised and Kriol-derived words are in plain font).\n\nGurindji Kriol contains many nominal suffixes, most of which are derived from Gurindji. These include case suffixes, number marking and derivational morphology. A number of these suffixes have Kriol-derived periphastic counterparts. For example, the privative suffix ''-murlung'' can also be expressed by ''gat no'' 'has no'.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type !! Form !! Origin !! Type !! Form !!

All subject pronouns are derived from Kriol and object pronouns find their origins in both languages. A general reflexive/reciprocal pronoun is derived from the Kriol reflexive pronoun. Emphatic pronouns are derived from Gurindji and are classified as nominals because they can be case-marked. Possessive pronouns are drawn from Gurindji and are also used as dative objects, e.g. ''nyununy'' 'your, to you'. (Note that this paradigm needs some work).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !!

Many of the auxiliaries also have reduced forms which attach to subject pronouns, such as ''ai-rra'' > ''ai garra'' 'I will'.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Category !! Form !! Etymology !!

It is mostly spoken at [[Kalkaringi]] and [[Daguragu, Northern Territory|Daguragu]] which are Aboriginal communities located on the traditional lands of the Gurindji. Related mixed varieties are spoken to the north by [[Ngarinyman]] and [[Bilinarra]] people at [[Yarralin]] and [[Pigeon Hole, Northern Territory|Pigeon Hole]]. These varieties are similar to Gurindji Kriol, but draw on Ngarinyman and Bilinarra which are closely related to Gurindji (Eastern Ngumpin languages).\n\nGurindji Kriol emerged in the 1970s from pervasive code-switching practices. It combines the lexicon and structure of Gurindji and Kriol. [[Gurindji language|Gurindji]] is a highly endangered language of the [[Ngumpin]]-Yapa subgroup ([[Pama-Nyungan]] family) and [[Australian Kriol language|Kriol]] is an English-lexifier creole language spoken as a first language by most Aboriginal people across northern Australia (with the exception of [[Arnhem Land]] and [[Daly River]] area).\n\nGurindji Kriol exhibits a structural split between the noun phrase and verb phrase, with Gurindji contributing the noun structure including case-marking, and the verb structure including TAM auxiliaries coming from Kriol. In this respect, Gurindji Kriol is classified as a verb-noun (V-N) mixed language. Other examples of V-N mixed languages include [[Michif]] and [[Light Warlpiri]]. The maintenance of Gurindji within the mixed language can be seen as the perpetuation of [[Australian Aboriginal identity|Aboriginal identity]] under massive and continuing cultural incursion.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

From 1855 onwards, the traditional lands of the Gurindji and neighbouring groups were seized by colonists who were searching for good cattle pastures. After initial attempts to cull the original inhabitants, cattle stations were set up and the remaining Gurindji people were brought to work on the stations in slave-like conditions with other Aboriginal groups. In 1966, the Gurindji initiated a workers' strike to protest against their poor conditions of employment and ultimately regain control of their traditional lands. Their campaign was called the [[Wave Hill Walk-off]] and went on for nine years, resulting in the first successful land claim by an Aboriginal group in Australia. Today the Gurindji continue to live on their traditional lands in two main communities - Kalkaringi and Daguragu.<ref>Meakins 2008a and see also [[Frank Hardy]]'s 'The Unlucky Australians' and Deborah Roses' 'Hidden Histories'</ref>\n\nThe linguistic practices of the Gurindji are closely tied to these social circumstances. Before colonisation the Gurindji were multilingual, speaking the languages of neighbouring groups with whom they had familiar and ceremonial connections. The establishment of the cattle stations by colonisers saw the introduction of the cattle station pidgin and later Kriol into the linguistic repertoire of the Gurindji. In the 1970s Patrick McConvell<ref>McConvell's home page: https://researchers.anu.edu.au/researchers/mcconvell-p</ref><ref>see McConvell 1985, 1988</ref> observed that code-switching between Kriol and Gurindji was the dominant language practice of Gurindji people. It is likely that this code-switching and a certain amount of levelling between Gurindji and closely related neighbouring languages such as Ngarinyman and Bilinarra provided fertile ground for the formation of the mixed language. At this time, similar changes to local linguistic ecologies occurred in other places in northern Australia with Kriol becoming the dominant language in many areas such as [[Timber Creek, Northern Territory|Timber Creek]] and Katherine. Yet in Kalkaringi, a mixed language emerged from this situation.<ref>see McConvell and Meakins 2005; McConvell, 2008; Meakins 2011c</ref> [[Felicity Meakins]]<ref>Meakins's home page: http://www.slccs.uq.edu.au//index.html?page=127733&pid=124851</ref><ref>Meakins 2008b:86-87</ref> argues that maintenance of Gurindji elements in the mixed language relates closely to the land rights movement and can be considered an expression of the persistence of their ancestral identity. Additionally McConvell<ref>(McConvell 2007)</ref> suggests that the homogeneity of the linguistic situation (one traditional language spoken at Kalkaringi) may have also aided the maintenance of Gurindji.\n\n==Current linguistic situation==\n\nGurindji Kriol is situated within a complex picture of multilingualism, contact and [[code-switching]]. Gurindji continues to be spoken by older people and a neighbouring traditional Australian language, [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]] is also used by people of Warlpiri heritage. [[Standard Australian English]] is the language of government services and the school, though its use is generally restricted to these domains. Kriol and Aboriginal English are spoken with Aboriginal visitors from other communities.<ref>see Meakins 2008b</ref> In this respect, Gurindji Kriol continues to be spoken alongside Gurindji and Kriol, and is a 'symbiotic' [[mixed language]]. In addition, code-switching continues to be an everyday practice at Kalkaringi, and it is common to find code-switching between Gurindji and Kriol, and between Gurindji Kriol and its source languages.\n\n==Lexicon==\n\nLexically there is a mix between Kriol and Gurindji. Despite the verb-noun structural split, some verbs are derived from Kriol and others from Gurindji. Similarly nouns from both languages are present. In general, based on a 200 word [[Swadesh list]], 36.6% of vocabulary is derived from Kriol and 35% finds its origins in Gurindji. The remaining 28.4% are synonymous forms from both languages, where the choice of word depends on a number of factors including the interlocutors. For example, more Gurindji vocabulary is used when addressing older Gurindji people or in the presence of outsiders.<ref>Meakins & O\u2019Shannessy, 2005:45</ref> Some lexical specialisation can be noted, for example ''karnti''  which means \"branch\", \"stick\" or \"tree\" in Gurindji is generally only used to mean \"branch\" or \"stick\" in Gurindji Kriol whereas the Kriol form ''tri''  is used to mean \"tree\".\n\n==Phonology==\n\nThe phonological system of Gurindji Kriol is relatively stratified, i.e. it has maintained separate Gurindji and Kriol phoneme inventories, syllable structures and many phonological processes.<ref>see Jones, Meakins, and Buchan 2011; Jones, Meakins, and Muawiyath to appear</ref>\n\nIn terms of vowels, Gurindji Kriol has a 5 vowel system. All Gurindji words contain only 3 vowel phonemes /\u026a/, /\u0250/ and /\u028a/ with diphthongs the result of combinations of vowels with glides in fast speech, for example /\u0250w/ > [\u0250\u028a]. Kriol words make use of five vowel phonemes /\u025b/ and /\u0254/ in addition to /\u026a/, /\u0250/ and /\u028a/, plus diphthongs and long vowels.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|-\n|  || Front || Central || Back\n|-\n| Close || i ||  || u\n|-\n| Mid || e ||  || \u0254\n|-\n| Open ||  || a || \n|}\n\nThe consonant inventory is a complex fusion of Gurindji and Kriol consonants. Words of Gurindji origin contain a three-way coronal contrast for stops, nasals and laterals, and a distinction between a post-alveolar rhotic and an apical trill (sometimes pronounced as a tap). Kriol-derived words contrast with those from Gurindji in containing fricatives. No voicing distinction is made for stops or fricatives in either Gurindji- or Kriol-derived words; voicing depends on position within word or utterance, and place of articulation.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable IPA\"\n|-\n|  || Bilabial   || Alveolar || Post-alveolar || Alveopalatal || Velar  \n|-\n| Stop || p || t || \u0288 || \u025f || k\n|-\n| Fricative || f || s ||  || \u0283 || \n|-\n| Nasal || m || n || \u0273 || \u0272 || \u014b\n|-\n| Lateral ||  || l || \u026d || \u028e || \n|-\n| Rhotic ||  || r, \u0279 || \u027b ||  || \n|-\n| Glide ||  ||  ||  || j || w\n|}\n\nStress is word initial for words of both Gurindji and Kriol origin. The maintenance of the two phonological systems is more obvious in syllable structure. A range of structures are permissible in words of both origins, e.g. CV and CVC, however VC syllables are only allowed in Kriol words. Gurindji and Kriol  source words also diverge in their use of stop-final consonant clusters. Gurindji words allows syllable-final consonant clusters, though the cluster combination is rather restricted. The first consonant must be a liquid and the final consonant, a non-coronal stop or velar nasal. Even in the more acrolectal forms of Kriol words, final consonant clusters are never present at the surface level. Finally different phonological processes apply to the different component languages of Gurindji Kriol. For example, in Kriol words, the plosive series is occasionally hypercorrected to fricatives of a similar place of articulation. This process never occurs in words of Gurindji origin.\n\n==Noun phrase==\n\nThe Gurindji Kriol noun phrase consists of a head plus a number of potential modifiers. Potential heads are: nouns, nominalised adjectives, emphatic pronouns and demonstratives (this/that); and modifiers are determiners (in/definite, plural/singular) and adjectives. Heads and modifiers can be distinguished by their ability to take case marking. Heads are case-marked, and modifiers are not. The order of noun phrase constituents is relatively fixed: DET - MOD - HEAD.  Finally Gurindji Kriol is an optional ergative language where the transitive subject is optionally marked ergative and objects are unmarked.<ref>Meakins 2009; Meakins and O'Shannessy 2010; O'Shannessy and Meakins to appear</ref>\n\n{|\n|-\n| dat || ''yapakayi'' || ''karu-ngku'' || i || bin || gon || ged-im-bat || dat || ''karu''\n|-\n| the || small || child-ERG || 3SG.SBJ || PST || go || get-TR-PROG || the || child\n|}\n\"The small kid goes to get the (other) kid.\"<ref name=\"Meakins, 2012b\">Meakins, 2012b</ref>\n\n(Note that in all examples Gurindji-derived words are italicised and Kriol-derived words are in plain font).\n\nGurindji Kriol contains many nominal suffixes, most of which are derived from Gurindji. These include case suffixes, number marking and derivational morphology. A number of these suffixes have Kriol-derived periphastic counterparts. For example, the privative suffix ''-murlung'' can also be expressed by ''gat no'' 'has no'.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Type !! Form !! Origin !! Type !! Form !!

All subject pronouns are derived from Kriol and object pronouns find their origins in both languages. A general reflexive/reciprocal pronoun is derived from the Kriol reflexive pronoun. Emphatic pronouns are derived from Gurindji and are classified as nominals because they can be case-marked. Possessive pronouns are drawn from Gurindji and are also used as dative objects, e.g. ''nyununy'' 'your, to you'. (Note that this paradigm needs some work).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !!

Many of the auxiliaries also have reduced forms which attach to subject pronouns, such as ''ai-rra'' > ''ai garra'' 'I will'.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Category !! Form !! Etymology !!

The agent also loses ergative case marking as an adjunct and acquires ablative case instead.\n\n{|\n|-\n| man || i || bin || get || bait || ''warlaku-nginyi'' || ''wartan-ta''\n|-\n| man || 3SG.SBJ || PST || get || bite || dog-ABL || hand-LOC\n|}\n\"The man got bitten by a dog on the hand.\"<ref>Meakins 2011c: 44</ref>\n\n==Complex sentences==\n\nConjoined clauses are often zero-marked such as the following sentence which was uttered within one prosodic contour.

Others are only used to relate verbal clauses such as dumaji (because), bikos (because), bat (but), ib (if), den (then).\n\n{|\n|-\n| dat || ''marluka'' || bin || trai || jidan || jiya-''ngka'' || bat || i || bin || ''kirt''\n|-\n| the || old.man || PST || MOD || sit || chair-LOC || but || 3SG.SBJ || PST || break\n|}\t\n\"The old man tried to sit on the chair but it broke.\"<ref name=\"Meakins 2012b\"/>\n\nSubordination is mostly performed by marking the verb in the subordinate clause with a case-marker. This style of subordination is derived from Gurindji. For example, the locative marker can be used in a switch reference construction to indicate that the agent of the subordinate clause is the same as the object of the main clause.\n\n{|\n|-\n| wan || ''karu-ngku'' || i || gib-it || la-im || keik || ''kajirri-yu'' || ''makin-ta''\n|-\n| a || child-ERG || 3SG.SBJ || give-TR || OBL-3SG.O || cake || woman-DAT || lie-LOC\n|}\n\"A child gives a cake to the woman who is lying down.\"<ref name=\"Meakins 2012b\"/>\n\nGurindji Kriol also contains asymmetrical serial verb constructions.

After its third season, The WB and [[United Paramount Network|UPN]] merged to form [[The CW]], which then became the broadcaster for the show in the United States. Schwahn served as executive producer while also writing and directing for the show, including the premieres and finales of all seasons.\n\nThe show began with nine main characters in its first season as the roles of Lucas Scott, Nathan Scott, Peyton Sawyer, Brooke Davis, Haley James, Dan Scott, Karen Roe, Keith Scott, and Whitey Durham. After that, characters from that first season left the show, with new main characters having been both written in and out of the series. Originally, it followed two half-brothers Lucas and Nathan Scott who started out as enemies but later formed a close bond as brothers. It also followed the brothers' various relationships with other female leads during their high-school years and in their early twenties. The series ultimately spanned nearly fifteen years across nine seasons, with various time jumps taken into account.\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=2}}\n\n==Casting==\n[[Chad Michael Murray]] was the first person to be cast for ''One Tree Hill.''<ref name=\"casting\">{{cite video |title=Building a Winning Team: The Making of One Tree Hill |medium=[[Documentary film|Documentary]] |location=[[One Tree Hill DVD releases#Season one|One Tree Hill: The Complete First Season]]'' |publisher=[[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> The producers were originally unsure as to who Murray would play.

He and Nathan started on bad terms but later become close brothers. He is a star on the high school basketball team. He had to quit playing sports after he found out he had a genetic heart problem, inherited from his father - this meant he had more time to focus on writing. He was involved in a complicated love-triangle between Brooke and Peyton, but eventually realized Peyton was the one for him. After Peyton temporarily turned down his proposal because she told him she was not ready, he begins dating his book editor Lindsay and gets engaged. Peyton returns to Tree Hill to get him back and after Lindsay realizes Lucas still loves Peyton she leaves him at the altar.

They later make amends, and after some time, the two get married and have a daughter, \"Sawyer Brooke Scott\". Lucas returns in the ninth season to help Haley deal with Nathan's disappearance by taking care of his nephew and niece.

She has a huge love for music and for art, and frequently sketches certain events in her life, or feelings she cannot bring herself to tell anybody about. Peyton develops feelings for [[Lucas Scott]] in the first season, but frequently tries keeping them to herself since he was consistently off-and-on with Brooke for the first four seasons. Her adoptive mother died in a car accident when she was young, and her adoptive father works out on the sea, which leaves Peyton on her own for most of the first four seasons. She met her birth mother Ellie Harp near the end of the second season, however she also dies from cancer by the middle of the third season. Peyton was consistently surrounded by terrible events: she was shot in the leg during the school shooting in season three and lost a lot of blood, but was rescued by Lucas, and was brutally attacked twice by Ian Banks, who pretended to be her long-lost brother Derek. She was saved the first time by Lucas and her real brother, and the second time by Brooke.

When Nathan asks Haley to tutor him in school because his low grades are putting him in danger of getting kicked off the basketball team and he hopes to further bother Lucas by hanging out with Lucas' best friend, she initially resists knowing that it would anger Lucas. However, Haley changes her mind and promises Nathan that if he leaves Lucas alone she will tutor him and Nathan agrees. When Lucas finds out about this, he is very angry with Haley, until Haley tells him about the deal she made with Nathan. While Haley tutors Nathan, they grow very close and eventually fall in love. Lucas is not initially supportive of the relationship, but as time goes on he forgives Haley, and Lucas and Nathan grow closer as brothers. At the end of the first season Nathan and Haley decide to get married at the age 16. Early in the second season, Haley and Nathan begin their married life and Haley starts to pursue music. She is asked to record a song with a man named Chris Keller, and afterwards he offers her the opportunity to go on tour with him. Nathan does not want her to leave so he gives her an ultimatum in which she could either choose him or the tour. Haley is angry at Nathan's ultimatum and leaves to go on the tour. During the tour, Haley and Nathan struggle with their feelings as they both love and miss each other, but are also quite angry and hurt. They almost get an annulment, but Haley decides to come back home to Nathan. He eventually forgives her and they rekindle their relationship. Feeling more in love than ever, the couple decides to renew their vows in front of all their friends and family.

Paul Johansson Returning for Final Season of One Tree Hill|date=July 18, 2011|work=E! Online|accessdate=July 19, 2011}}</ref> Daniel Robert \"Dan\" Scott is the original villain in Tree Hill. Dan is the ex-husband of Deb Lee and the father of Nathan and Lucas Scott. Originally wanting nothing to do with Lucas, he begins to want a part in Lucas's life. We find out that not only has Dan been following Lucas all his life, but that he wanted joint custody of Lucas but Karen refused. Lucas later moves in with Dan after learning that he has Dan's heart condition as it's the only way he could afford the medication. When Lucas fails Dan's test, he takes away Lucas's college fund which he had started when Lucas was a baby. He hired a woman (Jules) to make Keith fall in love with her as revenge for sleeping with Deb. Jules actually falls in love with Keith but leaves him on the altar after being threatened by Karen. Deb attempts to murder Dan by burning down his dealership. Dan, thinking it was Keith, shoots Keith and lets Jimmy Edwards take the blame as Jimmy committed suicide. Lucas gradually accepts Dan as his dad until he finds out what he did to Keith. Dan, realizing Nathan will never forgive him, turns himself in to the police. He then spends almost five years in prison and doesn't get out until Lucas' and Lindsey's wedding day.\n\nAfter prison, Dan becomes close with Nathan's son Jamie. Dan is taken hostage by Carrie, Jamie's ex-nanny who planned to kidnap Jamie and set Dan up for it. He is later rescued by Haley (who went to see him after Carrie called pretending to be a nurse saying Dan was about to die) and Deb (who came afterwards to help Haley and Jamie after realizing where Haley had really gone). He shoots Carrie and she is believed to be dead. When Jamie finds out what he did, he at first stops talking to Dan. Dan leaves Tree Hill to die as he does not think he will be able to find a new heart since one became available while he was being held hostage and he lost out on it. In the year time gap between seasons six and seven, Dan married Rachel, who takes him to Mexico and illegally buys a heart. After realizing the type of person Rachel is when she wants to take their TV show to the corridor where he murdered Keith, he gives all his money to charity and divorces her. Before leaving Tree Hill once again, he says goodbye to Jamie, who tells him he forgives him. He is seen working in a burger joint, where he is visited by Quinn for help with murdering Katie, but he ends up talking her out of it. He appears shortly in the season eight finale when Nathan gives him a photograph of Lydia and a baseball that Jamie hit in a game. Dan returns in season nine because he loses everything when his diner burns down. He convinces Haley to let him stay with them for a few days, saying he has nowhere else to go. A flash-forward sequence shows Dan with Chris Keller, burning down a house and apparently ready to kill someone. When Nathan is kidnapped, Haley seeks help from Dan who promises her that he will do whatever it takes to bring him back home. Eventually, Dan finds him and he ends up taking a bullet meant for Nathan which critically wounds him. At the hospital, Haley tells Dan that Lucas refuses to come see him. Dan says he's okay with that because he can't blame Lucas for not being there in his final moments when he wasn't there for Lucas his whole life. Dan also makes peace with Haley by saying he's glad he was proven wrong about Haley not being good enough for Nathan as she is the best thing that ever happened to him and apologizes for Keith's murder as Keith also meant a lot to her. Haley lets him hold Lydia and tells Dan that whenever Lydia asks about him, she and Nathan will tell her that he loved her and Jamie very much. Dan also makes amends with Deb and lastly, Nathan (in which Dan has a dream that he and Nathan play basketball just for fun for the first time ever) to which Nathan says that despite all the bad he did, he's still his father and forgives him and Dan dies moments later. Dan is visited by Keith who tells him that he's proud of him for finally learning to put family and friends first and become the brother he always wanted. As the two enter the light Dan asks Keith, \"I know where you're going. But what about me?\" Keith answers, \"Don't worry, little brother.

She began a serious relationship with Mouth after moving to Tree Hill with Brooke to open a store for \"Clothes Over Bros.\" In season seven after modelling for Brooke, she becomes a full-time model and the face of \"Clothes Over Bros\". This causes her to worry about her weight. As the pressure became too much, she started using cocaine with her new modelling friends. She became a shadow of her former self rejecting Mouth's love and Brooke's friendship. After help from Victoria and Alex, she gets her life back on track and moves back to New York to resume her position as Vice President of the company. She assisted Victoria in forging documents for \"Clothes Over Bros,\" causing Brooke to be arrested when it all came out.

He has gone through life feeling as though he is never good enough as his father had never shown him that he is proud of his achievements. When he first appears he begins a relationship with Peyton when she has broken up with Lucas. After he realizes she will never get over Lucas, he leaves her. Some time after, he heads to Tree Hill to produce a movie version of Lucas's book. At first it seemed like he just wanted Peyton back, but later falls for Brooke as he feels a connection with her as they share a similar past both as footnotes in the Lucas/Peyton love story. In season seven, Julian catches Alex Dupre's eye, a model and actress hired by Brooke for \"Clothes Over Bros.\" Brooke becomes very jealous of the friendship between the two and they break up for a while. After getting back together, the gang take a trip to Utah where Julian proposes to Brooke. She says yes. In season eight, he marries Brooke. Julian and Brooke decide that they want to start a family, so they explore adopting. They meet a nineteen-year-old girl named Chloe. Chloe then decides to give her baby to Brooke and Julian, but once she reconciles with her ex-boyfriend she decides to keep the baby, leaving Julian and Brooke heartbroken. A few weeks later Brooke and Julian decide to move to New York until she discovers they are expecting a baby and decide to stay in Tree Hill. The couple then found out they were expecting twins and after a fall while working they were delivered at seven months and put in a special care unit. At the end of season 8, Julian and Brooke are seen playing at home with their sons, whom they named Jude and Davis. In season nine, Julian accidentally leaves Davis in the car on a hot day and feels extremely guilty for almost killing his son.

Julian also helps Brooke deal with Xavier coming back.\n\n===Clay Evans===\nPlayed by [[Robert Buckley]] from season seven onwards, Clayton \"Clay\" Evans became Nathan's agent and close friend during the time jump of fourteen months between season six and seven. He's also close to Nathan's family, his wife Haley James Scott and their son James Lucas Scott. At first Clay is shown as a flirt and fond of one-night stands. Upon meeting Quinn James, Haley's sister, he's immediately drawn to her but backs off once he learns that she's going through a separation with her husband. In his past, Clay was married to a woman named Sara who died suddenly, leaving Clay emotionally scarred and unable to let go of her. Clay is a loyal friend and helps the Scotts through the Renee scandal but is fired once he fails to re-sign Nathan with the Bobcats. Quinn helps him get his job back and make peace with the loss of his wife so he can move on and the two fall in love.\nIn the season seven finale, both he and Quinn are shot by Clay's stalker, Katie Ryan and left for dead. Clay lingers between life and death with a gunshot wound to the chest and comes close to dying when his organs start to fail, but makes a miraculous recovery after a kidney transplant and awakens with Quinn at his side. He later helps Nathan with a career as a sporting agent.\nWe later find out that Clay in fact fathered a baby with Sara named Logan, who he later meets in a hospital while undergoing counseling for his disease.\nIn the penultimate episode of season 9, Clay proposes to Quinn in Logan's tent, which is set up in the living room. Quinn says yes.

She feels that her husband has begun to change and that they no longer have anything in common and later divorces him. She begins a relationship with Nathan's agent Clay. Her younger sister, Taylor, returns to Tree Hill with Quinn's former husband, causing a fight between the sisters. They later make things right before their mother dies of cancer.\n\nQuinn was the first one to be shot by Katie Ryan when she was heading to bed. She and Clay are in limbo while fighting for their lives. Clay tells her that she has to wake up because she is needed, especially by Haley. They confess their love for each other (\"Til kingdom come\") before Quinn wakes up and makes a full recovery, but fears for Clay when Haley tells her that his organs are failing. She visits Clay every day and he awakens with her by his side. Once they return home, Quinn is still haunted by the attack from Katie and keeps a gun hidden. When Clay finds it, he tells her that she should go to Africa for a photography gig because that will save her. She does and when she returns, it's revealed that part of her trip had been spent tracking down Katie as she has numerous photographs of her. She then visits Dan for help in killing her, but backs out at the last minute. Katie however, initiates an attack on Quinn when Clay is out of town but this time it is Quinn who shoots Katie. In season eight, she goes to Brooke's bachelorette party and ends up, after a drunken night, with a tongue piercing, raw meat in her purse and a stolen skateboarding dog. In season nine, Quinn helps Clay with his mental problems and supports Haley when Nathan goes missing. She's quite jarred when Clay reveals he had fathered a son named Logan whose existence he had blocked out of his mind after Sara's death.\n\nIn the penultimate episode of season 9, Clay proposes to Quinn in Logan's tent, set up in the living room. Quinn says yes. In the final episode, Quinn and Clay get married and adopt Logan.\n\n===Alex Dupre===\n\nPortrayed by [[Jana Kramer]] since season seven, Alex Dupre, real name Alice Whitehead, was originally a recurring character, but was moved to starring in the fourteenth episode. She is a fallen starlet whom Millicent hires to be the face of Clothes Over Bro's new line. At first, everyone thinks she is a ditzy and promiscuous girl. She later tries to have Julian produce a movie she scripted (although she at first does not disclose that she wrote it) and butts head with Brooke who sees her as a potential rival for Julian's attention. She almost ruins her chances of working with Julian by making a move on him, but they later reconcile and begin to write a script for a movie. She also jump-starts Millicent's modeling career by drugging another model, leaving Millie to take her spot. She is fired by Brooke when it is revealed she exposed herself to Julian in her hotel room. Later on, Alex and Millie become quite close, and Alex also tries to become close to Julian. When Julian refuses to be with her, she attempts suicide by slitting her wrists. She was hospitalized, and in a coma for a while, but she survives. Eventually, she takes her own place in the Tree Hill crowd, and everyone accepts her. Whilst at the film festival to promote the film she made with Julian, she begins to develop a crush on Chase, who had just broken up with Mia. On the last night, they kiss and then sleep with each other. In the season eight premiere, they have become a couple and Alex flaunts this in front of Mia while Chase teaches her how to bartend. Chase breaks up with her after she lies to him about a new movie project. Alex and Mia later fight over Chase, before it is revealed that he wants to be by himself now. After \"inviting herself\" to Brooke's bachelorette party, while they are all partying and drunk, Alex becomes included within the girls' group. At the end of the episode, she says to Quinn that even though the gang does not like her, she likes them and enjoys spending time with real friends, even though she is not their friend. Quinn then tells her that she considers Alex a friend.\n\n===Chase Adams===\n[[File:Stephen Colletti at the 2012 Comic-Con.jpg|thumb|220px|Stephen Colletti portrays Chase Adams.]]\n[[Stephen Colletti]] portrayed Chase Adams in a recurring role from seasons four till eight, before being upgraded to a regular from the eleventh episode of season eight. He was another member of the Clean Teens who got close to Brooke after she and Rachel joined the Clean Teens. Brooke, after earning a high grade in a test by cheating, agreed to tutor Chase, who initially had no idea of how Brooke really got the grade and they begin to date. When he found out that Brooke cheated he forgave her and they continued to date. Brooke and Chase attended a party at Nathan's mom's house and everyone found out that Nathan and Brooke filmed a sex tape. He visited Brooke while she was setting up for the prom and told her that his ex-girlfriend cheated on him with his best friend. He told her that it's over between them, but he knows how important the prom is to her so they will still go together. Brooke told him it's over because she did not want to be with someone who does not want to be with her. Chase later bumped into Brooke at school, he had been calling her after he heard about her being tied up by Psycho Derek. He was no longer wearing his 'Clean Teens' T-shirt and it is revealed that he still has feelings for Brooke, as she does for him. After a heartfelt confession, Chase and Brooke decided to get back together. In the finale, Brooke and Chase took their relationship to the next level and had sex in the backseat of his car.

In the season seven finale Alex ask him out for a date and kisses him just before he receive a text message from Mia wanting to get back together. Since they came back from the Utah he is now dating Alex. In the fifth episode of the eight season, he breaks up with Alex because she lied to him about a new movie project. Alex and Mia then fight over Chase, before it is revealed that because of their decisions he no longer wants to be with either and is instead choosing to be by himself. On Brooke and Julian's wedding he has \"slutty wedding sex\" with Mia. He then realizes he wants to be more than just a bar manager at TRIC after having a conversation with Mia the day after the wedding, and becomes a \"Big Brother\" to Chuck, one of Jamie's friends. In Season 9, Chase becomes friends with Chris Keller. He is also closer to Chuck and when Chuck's violent dad returns, Chase beats him with a crowbar to protect Chuck and is arrested, resulting in him being discharged from the Air Force.

In Season five, he is now working a delivery boy for a pizza place, is married to Bevin, and they have a son named Nathan, as learned when he gets locked in the library with Haley, Peyton, Brooke, Mia, and Lindsey.

She returned in Season two, saying she had earned custody of Jenny through a trial which Jake did not attend because he was in hiding. When Jake refused to give Jenny to her and turned himself in to the police because there was a warrant out for his arrest, she still managed to locate her and take her away.

Brooke told Victoria that she was ready to take the company to the next level and Victoria replied that they were going to have everything that they ever wanted. She told Brooke that she would like her to call her Victoria, because 'Mom' makes her sound too old.\nLater on she tried to control Brooke's decision over COB's future as the CEO of the brand (the opening of the Tree Hill boutique and Peyton's label) but ended up alienating her daughter by repeatedly rejecting her. Brooke fired her mother after she went behind her back to scare Rachel off.<ref name=\"OTH511\"/> At the beginning of Season 6 she returned to inform Brooke that she is part owner of Clothes Over Bros and although Brooke protested, she informed her that designers come and go, but the CEO remains the same. She threatened to go to the board to have Brooke removed or there start a legal battle over the company. Brooke countered by telling her that the new line is going to ensure that Victoria will be fired and Brooke will own the company in full. Victoria later arrived at Clothes Over Bros to scare the sketches for the new line out of Millicent who refused calling her \"an evil bitch\" to which Victoria replied, \"You're going to pay for that\". Later that night as Brooke was locking up the store a masked assailant attacked her, brutally injuring her and stealing the computer, money out of the register and the sketches for Brooke's new line. It is speculated that Victoria hired the assailant as a way to steal the sketches with the cover of a robbery so Brooke would be unable to go to the police.\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-right: 1em; margin-left: 2em; font-size: 95%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:25em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"| \"I loved the opportunity to play such a witch.\"\n|-\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\u2014Zuniga on becoming involved with the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/one-tree-hill/exclusive-interview-daphne-zun-22687.aspx|title=Exclusive Interview: Daphne Zuniga of 'One Tree Hill'|date=September 11, 2008|work=Buddy TV|accessdate=January 21, 2011}}</ref>\n|}\nBrooke later confronted her about the attack/robbery to which Victoria vehemently denied any involvement in. She was shocked to see that Brooke carries a gun with her and explained that she never wanted a child, that she wanted everything Brooke has and that when she could not have it, she decided to end her husband's dream of having a son. Brooke was disgusted with her mother and gave the company over to Victoria who subsequently fired Millicent and closed the Tree Hill Clothes Over Bros store. Victoria returns to Tree Hill after \"Clothes over Bros\" is failing without Brooke's' help. She manages to convince Brooke to come back with a 51% share, and after previously being shunned by Sam because of her unkindness, also manages to befriend Sam, as shown at the end when she comforts Sam while she cries over Jack's departure.

However, just when Millie is about to have the book thrown at her, Victoria comes to her defense and gets her off, as well as offering her old job back as long as she kicks the habit and never steals from C/B again. She then hires a new designer for the companies new men's line \"Clothes 4 Bros\" named Alexander Coyne. Victoria also speaks to Julian and tells him to fight for Brooke as their relationship begins to dissolve. She and her daughter then have another heart to heart where Victoria admits that she is getting \"soft.\" She is caught performing oral sex on Alexander at Quinn's photo gallery opening, and admits as much to the tabloids, which at first thought Brooke was involved.\n\nAt the beginning of season eight, it is discovered Victoria and Millicent have been defrauding Clothes Over Bros. and its investors.

After Lucas kissed Peyton, he proposed to Lindsey, and she said yes. She asked Haley, whom she had befriended, to be her maid of honor and asked Brooke to make her dress.

He was a member of the Tree Hill Ravens. He is originally portrayed as an arrogant jock and harassed Haley on her first day of teaching, and provoked her to fail him for the quarter on her second day, effectively preventing him from joining the revamped Ravens. He quit school, but thanks to Haley's inability to give up on him and convincing Nathan to tell Quentin that he might lose everything just like he did if he did not quit being such a jerk and tells Quentin that he used to be like that. He went back to both Haley's classes and the team and slowly started to change his attitude. His jersey number for the Tree Hill Ravens is #44. After hitting Jason to \"defend Haley's honor\" he suffered from a hand fracture, compromising his chances to be recruited by a college's basketball team. However, after a change of strategy by the Ravens, he became their point guard, even with a broken hand. He also becomes good friends with Jamie and explained that it was because Jamie reminded him so much of his younger brother, Andre. In episode 2 of Season 6, he was shot and killed by an assailant when he accidentally discovered a murder while paying for gas. It is later revealed there is a connection between Quentin's murder and Brooke Davis' attack at Clothes Over Bros. The assailant is Xavier, the brother of Quentin's classmate Sam Walker's friend Jack (he also attacked Brooke at her store for Sam). His jersey #44 was retired by Tree Hill High (joining the #23 jersey of Nathan and #1 jersey for Coach Durham, but replacing the #33 jersey worn by Dan, whose number was un-retired after his murder conviction), and as a tribute to Quentin, the Ravens played with only four players the rest of the season.\n\nFollowing his death, Quentin appears as a ghost to Nathan, urging him to follow his dreams of reaching the NBA. When Nathan is called up to the Charlotte Bobcats, he goes to the cemetery to leave his Bobcats jersey on Quentin's grave. Nathan wrote his initials \"QF\" and jersey number \"44\" on one sneaker, writing the initials of Jamie (JLS) and his favorite number (12) on the other shoe. He is briefly mentioned by Jamie in the season 7 when he mentions the people he misses. Jamie and Nathan are in Lucas' house at the time while Julian, Brooke and Alex are at work on the movie.\n\nQuentin is briefly mentioned in Season 9 by Xavier while he attacks Brooke a second time, taunting her for having the same look in her eyes that Quentin had right before Xavier killed him.\n\n===Carrie===\n[[File:Torrey DeVitto by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|170px|Torrey DeVitto portrays the nanny, Carrie]]\nPortrayed by [[Torrey DeVitto]] during seasons five and six.

When Dan tries to escape, he discovers the grave of a child and that Carrie once had a young son who died. She poses as a hospice nurse who calls Haley and tells her that Dan is near death and is wishing to see Jamie. Haley takes Jamie to see Dan, but tells him to stay in the car while she checks everything out. Once inside, Haley finds Dan restrained to the bed. As she unties him, Dan tries to warn her to get Jamie away, but Carrie sneaks up behind her and knocks her out. As Jamie is wondering where Haley is, Carrie appears and tells him to open the door. Jamie refuses and Carrie gets an ax and breaks the car window, but then sees that Jamie has escaped from the other side of the car and runs into a cornfield. Carrie chases after him, but Jamie is able to hide from her. As he starts running again, he is grabbed by someone who turns out to be Haley. The two of them hide until Haley's phone rings, alerting Carrie to where they are. As she chases Haley and Jamie back to the house, Deb appears and smashes a wine bottle in Carrie's face, momentarily subduing her. Haley asks how she knew where they were and Deb tells her she knew something was up once she saw the address because Dan always hated the woods. At that moment, Carrie charges at them with the ax, but is shot by Dan. Later, Carrie wakes up on the ground and starts laughing at Dan, who's still standing there. Dan tells her that he called the police and Carrie says that she'll get out and come back. Dan reminds her that he told her he'd kill her if she ever came near his family again and Carrie tells Dan she's not dead. Dan says \"Sure you are\" and shoots her again, presumably killing her.\n\n===Mia Catalano===\n{|class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 2em; font-size: 95%; background:#c6dbf7; color:black; width:35em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n|style=\"text-align: left;\"|\"It's an interesting blend.

After its third season, The WB and [[United Paramount Network|UPN]] merged to form [[The CW]], which then became the broadcaster for the show in the United States. Schwahn served as executive producer while also writing and directing for the show, including the premieres and finales of all seasons.\n\nThe show began with nine main characters in its first season as the roles of Lucas Scott, Nathan Scott, Peyton Sawyer, Brooke Davis, Haley James, Dan Scott, Karen Roe, Keith Scott, and Whitey Durham. After that, characters from that first season left the show, with new main characters having been both written in and out of the series. Originally, it followed two half-brothers Lucas and Nathan Scott who started out as enemies but later formed a close bond as brothers. It also followed the brothers' various relationships with other female leads during their high-school years and in their early twenties. The series ultimately spanned nearly fifteen years across nine seasons, with various time jumps taken into account.\n\n{{TOClimit|limit=2}}\n\n==Casting==\n[[Chad Michael Murray]] was the first person to be cast for ''One Tree Hill.''<ref name=\"casting\">{{cite video |title=Building a Winning Team: The Making of One Tree Hill |medium=[[Documentary film|Documentary]] |location=[[One Tree Hill DVD releases#Season one|One Tree Hill: The Complete First Season]]'' |publisher=[[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers Home Entertainment]]}}</ref> The producers were originally unsure as to who Murray would play.

He and Nathan started on bad terms but later become close brothers. He is a star on the high school basketball team. He had to quit playing sports after he found out he had a genetic heart problem, inherited from his father - this meant he had more time to focus on writing. He was involved in a complicated love-triangle between Brooke and Peyton, but eventually realized Peyton was the one for him. After Peyton temporarily turned down his proposal because she told him she was not ready, he begins dating his book editor Lindsay and gets engaged. Peyton returns to Tree Hill to get him back and after Lindsay realizes Lucas still loves Peyton she leaves him at the altar. Lucas tells Peyton he hates her and wishes she never came back to Tree Hill because she ruined his life. They later make amends, and after some time, the two get married and have a daughter, \"Sawyer Brooke Scott\". Lucas returns in the ninth season to help Haley deal with Nathan's disappearance by taking care of his nephew and niece. Lucas is currently traveling with Peyton, Karen and Andy, while raising Sawyer and writing a new book.\n\n===Nathan Scott===\n{{Main|Nathan Scott}}\nPortrayed by [[James Lafferty]] since the pilot, Nathan Royal Scott was a basketball player for the Charlotte Bobcats, husband of Haley James Scott and the father of James Lucas Scott and Lydia Bob Scott. He originally started out as a villain and enemy of his brother, Lucas. After falling for Lucas's best friend, Haley, he becomes a better person and later forms a strong bond with his brother. During the course of his life he has experienced many obstacles including spending time in a wheelchair following an accident after a fight; dealing with an overbearing father; an alcoholic-drug addict mother; allegations he cheated on Haley. Nathan overcomes all of his problems throughout the series and vows to never raise his child the way Dan raised him. Nathan maintains a strong bond with his mother, who was at one point Jamie's nanny. After waiting for Haley to go into labor, Haley gives birth to Lydia Bob Scott. In season nine, he is traveling a lot as an agent but when returning to Haley, Jamie and Lydia he is taken by some people that are getting paid to kill him. After some time Nathan is rescued by Chris Keller, Dan and Julian, but Dan is critically injured after taking a bullet meant for Nathan.

In the final episode time jump, Nathan is seen with everyone else at Jamie's basketball game who has since broken Nathan's record for all time scorer.\n\n===Peyton Sawyer===\n[[File:Hilarie Burton Gitmo (crop).jpg|thumb|right|180px|Hilarie Burton portrayed Peyton Elizabeth Sawyer during the first six seasons of the show.]]\n{{Main|Peyton Sawyer}}\nPortrayed by [[Hilarie Burton]] from the pilot until the season six finale, Peyton Elizabeth Sawyer, was introduced in the first season as [[Nathan Scott]]'s on-and-off girlfriend. She has a huge love for music and for art, and frequently sketches certain events in her life, or feelings she cannot bring herself to tell anybody about. Peyton develops feelings for [[Lucas Scott]] in the first season, but frequently tries keeping them to herself since he was consistently off-and-on with Brooke for the first four seasons. Her adoptive mother died in a car accident when she was young, and her adoptive father works out on the sea, which leaves Peyton on her own for most of the first four seasons. She met her birth mother Ellie Harp near the end of the second season, however she also dies from cancer by the middle of the third season. Peyton was consistently surrounded by terrible events: she was shot in the leg during the school shooting in season three and lost a lot of blood, but was rescued by Lucas, and was brutally attacked twice by Ian Banks, who pretended to be her long-lost brother Derek. She was saved the first time by Lucas and her real brother, and the second time by Brooke. Peyton left for Los Angeles to work as an intern at a major record label at the end of season four, but did not enjoy herself or feel she was accomplishing anything, so she returned to Tree Hill in the season five premiere. Peyton eventually married Lucas near the end of season six, and the two had a daughter, Sawyer Brooke Scott. Peyton and Lucas leave Tree Hill to raise Sawyer on the road, alongside Lucas's mother Karen, her daughter Lily, and her boyfriend Andy.\n\n===Haley James Scott===\n[[File:Bethany Joy Galeotti.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Bethany Joy Lenz portrays Haley James Scott.]]\nHaley Bob James Scott is played by Bethany Joy Lenz, Haley Bob James Scott was first seen in the pilot episode and last seen in the series finale 'One Tree Hill'. When the series begins, Haley is best friends with Lucas Scott (Chad Michael Murray). Although Lucas and Nathan Scott are half brothers and teammates on the basketball team, they do not get along at all and Nathan picks on Lucas incessantly. When Nathan asks Haley to tutor him in school because his low grades are putting him in danger of getting kicked off the basketball team and he hopes to further bother Lucas by hanging out with Lucas' best friend, she initially resists knowing that it would anger Lucas. However, Haley changes her mind and promises Nathan that if he leaves Lucas alone she will tutor him and Nathan agrees. When Lucas finds out about this, he is very angry with Haley, until Haley tells him about the deal she made with Nathan. While Haley tutors Nathan, they grow very close and eventually fall in love. Lucas is not initially supportive of the relationship, but as time goes on he forgives Haley, and Lucas and Nathan grow closer as brothers. At the end of the first season Nathan and Haley decide to get married at the age 16. Early in the second season, Haley and Nathan begin their married life and Haley starts to pursue music. She is asked to record a song with a man named Chris Keller, and afterwards he offers her the opportunity to go on tour with him. Nathan does not want her to leave so he gives her an ultimatum in which she could either choose him or the tour. Haley is angry at Nathan's ultimatum and leaves to go on the tour. During the tour, Haley and Nathan struggle with their feelings as they both love and miss each other, but are also quite angry and hurt. They almost get an annulment, but Haley decides to come back home to Nathan. He eventually forgives her and they rekindle their relationship. Feeling more in love than ever, the couple decides to renew their vows in front of all their friends and family. During their senior year, just as Nathan is offered a scholarship to play for Duke University, Haley informs him that she is pregnant. Although he is initially upset about her not informing him about the pregnancy first, Nathan comes around and the two are quite excited about the pregnancy.

Nathan fell into a depression and was quite angry with his circumstances. As the season opens several months after his injuries, Nathan's depression is taking a serious toll on his family. Haley tells him that she can't stay in their marriage any longer if it continues the way it has been. This wakes Nathan up and he reengages in fatherhood, their marriage, and his life. After struggling through marriage counseling, an obsessed nanny, and Haley's depression after the death of her mother, Haley and Nathan's life and relationship settle down and they have a second child, a daughter named Lydia Scott.\n\n===Dan Scott===\n{{for|the broadcaster and politician who briefly used the name \"Dan Scott\"|Dan Patrick (politician)}}\nDaniel Robert Scott, also known as Dan/Danny, played by [[Paul Johansson]] as a series regular from the pilot to the thirteenth episode of season seven. He appeared as a special guest star for two episodes in season eight. He returns in season 9 until he is killed.<ref name=\"Dan Scott Returns\">{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b252862_dan_back_paul_johansson_returning_final.html|title=Dan Is Back! Paul Johansson Returning for Final Season of One Tree Hill|date=July 18, 2011|work=E! Online|accessdate=July 19, 2011}}</ref> Daniel Robert \"Dan\" Scott is the original villain in Tree Hill. Dan is the ex-husband of Deb Lee and the father of Nathan and Lucas Scott. Originally wanting nothing to do with Lucas, he begins to want a part in Lucas's life. We find out that not only has Dan been following Lucas all his life, but that he wanted joint custody of Lucas but Karen refused. Lucas later moves in with Dan after learning that he has Dan's heart condition as it's the only way he could afford the medication. When Lucas fails Dan's test, he takes away Lucas's college fund which he had started when Lucas was a baby. He hired a woman (Jules) to make Keith fall in love with her as revenge for sleeping with Deb. Jules actually falls in love with Keith but leaves him on the altar after being threatened by Karen. Deb attempts to murder Dan by burning down his dealership. Dan, thinking it was Keith, shoots Keith and lets Jimmy Edwards take the blame as Jimmy committed suicide. Lucas gradually accepts Dan as his dad until he finds out what he did to Keith. Dan, realizing Nathan will never forgive him, turns himself in to the police. He then spends almost five years in prison and doesn't get out until Lucas' and Lindsey's wedding day.\n\nAfter prison, Dan becomes close with Nathan's son Jamie. Dan is taken hostage by Carrie, Jamie's ex-nanny who planned to kidnap Jamie and set Dan up for it. He is later rescued by Haley (who went to see him after Carrie called pretending to be a nurse saying Dan was about to die) and Deb (who came afterwards to help Haley and Jamie after realizing where Haley had really gone). He shoots Carrie and she is believed to be dead. When Jamie finds out what he did, he at first stops talking to Dan. Dan leaves Tree Hill to die as he does not think he will be able to find a new heart since one became available while he was being held hostage and he lost out on it. In the year time gap between seasons six and seven, Dan married Rachel, who takes him to Mexico and illegally buys a heart. After realizing the type of person Rachel is when she wants to take their TV show to the corridor where he murdered Keith, he gives all his money to charity and divorces her. Before leaving Tree Hill once again, he says goodbye to Jamie, who tells him he forgives him. He is seen working in a burger joint, where he is visited by Quinn for help with murdering Katie, but he ends up talking her out of it. He appears shortly in the season eight finale when Nathan gives him a photograph of Lydia and a baseball that Jamie hit in a game. Dan returns in season nine because he loses everything when his diner burns down. He convinces Haley to let him stay with them for a few days, saying he has nowhere else to go. A flash-forward sequence shows Dan with Chris Keller, burning down a house and apparently ready to kill someone. When Nathan is kidnapped, Haley seeks help from Dan who promises her that he will do whatever it takes to bring him back home. Eventually, Dan finds him and he ends up taking a bullet meant for Nathan which critically wounds him. At the hospital, Haley tells Dan that Lucas refuses to come see him. Dan says he's okay with that because he can't blame Lucas for not being there in his final moments when he wasn't there for Lucas his whole life. Dan also makes peace with Haley by saying he's glad he was proven wrong about Haley not being good enough for Nathan as she is the best thing that ever happened to him and apologizes for Keith's murder as Keith also meant a lot to her. Haley lets him hold Lydia and tells Dan that whenever Lydia asks about him, she and Nathan will tell her that he loved her and Jamie very much. Dan also makes amends with Deb and lastly, Nathan (in which Dan has a dream that he and Nathan play basketball just for fun for the first time ever) to which Nathan says that despite all the bad he did, he's still his father and forgives him and Dan dies moments later. Dan is visited by Keith who tells him that he's proud of him for finally learning to put family and friends first and become the brother he always wanted. As the two enter the light Dan asks Keith, \"I know where you're going. But what about me?\" Keith answers, \"Don't worry, little brother. You're my plus one.\"\n\n===Brooke Davis===\n[[Image:Sophia Bush cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Sophia Bush portrays Brooke Davis.]]\nPortrayed by [[Sophia Bush]] since the series' second episode, Brooke Penelope Baker, n\u00e9e Davis, was originally an immature party girl, who was neglected by her parents.

She again battled drugs in season four, so Dan and Karen set up an intervention but had it turned down and stormed out, but in season 5 she cleaned up her act and became Jamie's nanny. She meets a man on the internet who turns out to be her son's friend \"Skills\" and begins a relationship. Deb later ends it as she believes he should have children and get married which she does not want to do again. In her final episodes, Dan tells her it's as much her fault Keith died as his as he thought it was Keith who set fire to the car lot which is why he killed him, which again leaves Deb filled with guilt. However, in Deb's last scene, Dan tells her to not blame herself and to not feel guilty as it's not her fault. Following this, Deb falls off the canvas, only to return to Tree Hill a few years later upon Nathan going missing. During her return, she consoled Haley and confronted Dan and once he was hospitalized upon rescuing Nathan.

When Skills leaves for a new job in season 7, Mouth begins to date Lauren, which ends his friendship with Skills when he finds out. Skills later forgives Mouth.

Tim was Nathan's best friend until Nathan married Haley. He then clung on to Nathan and had a hard time adjusting to the fact that Nathan had new friends outside of him. His appearances slowly turned to comic-relief such as when he mistook a pair of female police officers for strippers at a party, insisting on them giving him a show even as they handcuffed him and put him in a police car. He then attended a school for \"slower students\". In Season five, he is now working a delivery boy for a pizza place, is married to Bevin, and they have a son named Nathan, as learned when he gets locked in the library with Haley, Peyton, Brooke, Mia, and Lindsey. At the end of the episode, it turns out that he knew how to get out all along, but didn't say anything because he enjoyed hanging out with everyone again and says that no one really keeps in touch anymore. In the series finale, Bevin reveals that she is divorced due to her extreme hatred for Tim, indicating an unhappy and short marriage between the two.\n\n===Junk Moretti===\nPlayed by [[Cullen Moss]] since the pilot, Jonathan Moretti, also known as Junk, is one of the players from the River Court.

Originally intended to be an extra during cheerleading scenes, Prince was later given lines to speak. Her friendship with Brooke is established in season two when Bevin expresses that she is a great captain. Bevin dates Skills in seasons three and four, but they breakup after the relationship not working out throughout the missing years. She is not very bright, but she reveals in season four that she only acts dumb for people to rely on her in that way. In season five, we see that she is married to Tim Smith, who is also not smart, and they have a son named Nathan. She now works in a department store.<ref name=\"Ep214\">{{cite episode|title=Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows|series=One Tree Hill|credits=R. Lee Fleming, Jr. (writer) & Babu Subramaniam (director)|network=The WB|airdate={{date|2004-02-15|mdy}}|season=2|number=14}}</ref>\nBevin doesn't make another appearance until the series finale when Clay and Quinn go to confirm the adoption of Clay's son, Logan.

Larry also is attracted to Karen for a time, but it fades when she meets Andy.\n\n===Nicki===\n[[Emmanuelle Vaugier]] played Nicki during the first two seasons. She first appeared as a girl who had a one-night stand with Lucas. She wanted to get involved in her daughter's life but Jake would not let her. She told him that she would get to Jenny with or without him. She tried to use Brooke to find out where he was but was fooled into going to Seattle while he was actually in Savannah. She returned in Season two, saying she had earned custody of Jenny through a trial which Jake did not attend because he was in hiding. When Jake refused to give Jenny to her and turned himself in to the police because there was a warrant out for his arrest, she still managed to locate her and take her away. Jake then chased after her and in Season three, it is revealed that they both live in Savannah and will continue to share custody until the next trial.\n\n===Lydia James===\nPlayed by [[Bess Armstrong]] during seasons two and seven.

Television]]|date=2005}}</ref> The character was made bisexual as opposed to a lesbian so that her past could be kept secret.

Davis.\nShe misinterpreted Lucas showing Brooke an engagement ring, as the two getting engaged and told Brooke that she would have annulment papers drawn up fast. She felt that Brooke should be focusing on the company and not \u2018boys with rings,\u2019 and reminded her that the company is called Clothes ''over'' Bros. Brooke told Victoria that she was ready to take the company to the next level and Victoria replied that they were going to have everything that they ever wanted.

Jamie refuses and Carrie gets an ax and breaks the car window, but then sees that Jamie has escaped from the other side of the car and runs into a cornfield. Carrie chases after him, but Jamie is able to hide from her. As he starts running again, he is grabbed by someone who turns out to be Haley.

The first written reference to the name and the island itself appears in [[Charles Henry Davis]]'s book ''Narrative of the North Polar expedition'' (1876), which is a narrative of Hall's third North Pole expedition.

This does not answer when it was named. However, the ship's doctor and leader of the scientific part of the expedition, [[Emil Bessels]], wrote of it in his own book, ''Die amerikanische Nordpol-Expedition'' (1879). On page 124 he tells that on August 29, 1871, on the voyage north through Kennedy Channel, the Polaris sailed between Grinnell-land (Ellesmere Island) and a small unknown island which they later named Hans Island, after his native Greenlandic helper, Hans Hendrik.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nAn earlier mention of a Hans Island expedition is in Elisha Kent Kane's ''Arctic Explorations: The Second Grinnell Expedition, 1853, \u201954, \u201955'', (published 1857), in pages 317\u2013319. Thus the year 1853 is now often cited as the date of the discovery and naming of the island, including in a letter by the Danish Ambassador to Canada in the ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' on July 28, 2005.\n\n{{quote|We now neared the Littleton Island of Captain Inglefield where a piece of good fortune awaited us.

Since the islands named by Kane were large enough to hold a notable amount of birds (and at least in case of the eiders, a breeding colony), any tiny rocks not obvious on satellite imagery can be disregarded, and thus it is almost certain there are only 2 islets of Littleton, Eider being the larger and Hans the smaller.

Within days, it spread to other newspapers worldwide.\n\nOn March 25, 2004, when Adrian Humphreys of the Canadian ''[[National Post]]'' newspaper wrote an article entitled \"Five-year plan to 'put footprints in the snow' and assert northern sovereignty\", Humphreys made a brief mention of the dispute over Hans Island, and that the Danes had sent warships to the island.\n\nThe Arctic sea region has long been [[sovereignty claims in the Arctic|a subject of the dispute]]. In this matter, Canada, Denmark, [[Iceland]], [[Russia]], and [[Norway]] share a common interest because they regard parts of the Arctic seas as \"national waters\". The [[United States]] and most [[European Union]] countries, on the other hand, officially regard the region as [[international waters]]. Further items in the Canadian media led to the issue being picked up by international news organizations.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nThe [[Government of Canada]]'s [[Canadian federal budget, 2004|2004 budget]] was introduced on March 23, 2004, two days before the issue gained widespread attention. It proposed minimal increases to spending on national defence. The issue of Hans Island was raised in the [[Canadian Parliament]] by opposition foreign affairs critic [[Stockwell Day]] to highlight the government's failure to provide more funding for the military.\n\nA new article by Adrian Humphreys on March 30, 2004, also in the ''National Post'', entitled \"Danes summon envoy over Arctic fight\u2014the solution of the dispute is not going to be military\", drew even more attention to the issue.

Both governments stated the dispute was a long-standing issue, and nothing had changed in the matter.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nA Canadian military exercise, named \"Narwhal 04\", inflamed the issue further. However, this exercise had been in the planning stage since September 2003, and it took place around [[Pangnirtung]], [[Baffin Island]], {{convert|2000|km|-1|abbr=on}} south of Hans Island. The Canadian military denied the exercise had anything to do with the Danish\u2013Canadian territorial dispute.

The illegal removal of coral is one of the most major environmental issues in many counties of Eastern Asia that destroys valuable [[ecosystem]]s that harbors marine life. The resulting effect of harvesting coral colonies causes a significant financial loss to the surrounding economies and the destruction of environments.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Precious coral|Coral]] is one of the most highly valued pieces of [[jewellery|jewelry]] in many parts of Asia. It has a wholesale market value between $50 to $60 million per year and the value of each piece of jewelry is based on the color, size, and quality of the coral.<ref name=\"New York Times\">{{cite news|last1=Nagano|first1=Yutiko|title=Reefs Suffer Amid Surging Demand for Jewelry Coral|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/fashion/reefs-suffer-amid-surging-demand-for-jewelry-coral.html?_r=0|publisher=New York Times|date=12 November 2013}}</ref> The most common type of coral harvested that is sold is known as red coral since it is believed that this type of coral is the most precious of all types of coral. The substance is thought to be endowed with enigmatic sanctified properties as well as thought to bring about many cures and remedies. Unfortunately due to these beliefs, coral has been harvested for centuries being passed around and traded well-throughout Eastern Asia.\n\nSince the 8th century, people have poached coral from marine ecosystems in an effort to sell it as jewelry. Coral [[poaching]] is one of the most major environmental issues in Asia which continues to destroy many valuable ecosystems and habitats. {{As of|2015}}, it is estimated that about 18.7% of [[coral reef]]s are taken care of by [[marine protected area]]s and only 2% of these areas are satisfactory enough to prevent further degradation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coral Reef Conservation|url=http://www.coml.org/discoveries/trends/coral_reef_conservation}}</ref> It is estimated that about $230,000,000 dollars is generated annually from illegal coral poaching.<ref name=NH>{{cite journal|last1=Tsounis |first1=Georgios A.|title=Jewel of the deep: are the modern incarnations of age-old traditions--coral diving and craftsmanship--selling Mediterranean red coral out?|journal=Natural History|date=2009|volume=118|pages=30}}</ref> This causes a significant loss of value in the area being poached and has a damaging effect of the marine wildlife that lives in the area. In 1997, it was reported that a number of exporters of precious coral come from countries such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Indonesia.\n\n== Methods and reasons ==\n[[File:Parure realizzata per la regina Farida d'Egitto (1934).JPG|thumb|Coral jewelry, [[Coral Jewellery Museum]]]]\nThe market for coral is mainly in Asia. Often, coral is poached by [[Fisherman|fishermen]] from China, India, or Japan claiming to be on legitimate fishing trips. Divers on these boats will then go down and harvest the coral. The coral will then be taken to be cured and refined into jewelry, which is then sold on the market. Coral is mined for limestone and other construction materials used for [[brick]]s, road-fill, and [[cement]] for new buildings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coral mining \u2013 The new danger for reefs|url=http://www.ecochicmagazine.co.uk/people-planet/biodiversity-people-planet/coral-mining-the-new-danger-for-reefs}}</ref> It is also taken for the [[calcium]] that is in the coral, as well as for decoration in [[marine aquarium]]s.<ref name=PDF>{{cite web|title=CORAL REEF MINING,  HARVESTING AND TRADE|url=http://www.icran.org/pdf/CoralMiningIssueBrief.pdf}}</ref> Jewelry companies in China, Taiwan, and India would be more than willing to pay a hefty price for coral so that it could be made into jewelry for them to sell on the market. With one colony of coral going up to 65,0000 a piece, many fisherman in Asia are willing to risk the punishment for the highly prized piece of jewelry.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coast Guard Boosting Patrols Chinese Coral Poachers|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/10/31/national/crime-legal/coast-guard-boosting-patrols-chinese-coral-poachers/#.VFzC0fnF_HW}}</ref> Illegal confiscations of coral colonies occur along the sea borders between China and Japan.\nCoral reefs also contain species that naturally produce important antibacterial and other chemical defense mechanisms that are used in medicine. Some uses of these compounds go into medicine that is used for treatments against cancer, arthritis, heart disease, bacterial infections, viruses and asthma.The breeding grounds for fish, and chemical properties that coral reefs provide make up for a commercial value estimated by the National Marine Fisheries Service to be over $100 million [https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/marine-life-education-resources/coral-reef-ecosystems].\n\n== Effects on the environment ==\nMost coral colonies that are harvested take a long time to recover and the effect on the ecosystem surrounding it can be tremendous. It is believed that about one-third of coral reefs worldwide are damaged beyond repair and the rest is under critical condition and threat. One coral site could take a minimum of 10 years to fully recover and could even take up to 50 years to finally be functioning in the environment as it had before.<ref name=Brown>{{cite journal|last1=Brown|first1=Barbara|title=The Environmental Impact of Coral Mining on Coral Reefs in the Maldives|journal=Environmental Conservation|date=August 2009|volume=15|issue=2|pages=159\u2013165|doi=10.1017/S0376892900028976}}</ref> Many marine wildlife communities use the coral for many different things such as: homes, food, and a means for protection against prey.

Coastlines and fish are known to be protected and preserved by the presence of coral reefs [https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/news/dec19/noaa-launches-mission-iconic-reefs-to-save-florida-keys-coral-reefs.html] Coastlines become vulnerable when the power of the open ocean is no longer being dissipated by the structure that coral reefs provide.There are many towns and cities that depend on the defense of coral reefs on their shores, such as Florida Keys, where the shore is lined with homes and businesses. Without the coral reef, the buildings could be at great risk of water damage due to erosion of the shore line. Reefs are also critical to marine biodiversity. Up to 25% of the entire oceans marine life is found in a coral reef ecosystem, and up to 7,000 species depend on the reefs to survive [https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/marine-life-education-resources/coral-reef-ecosystems]. Scientists are now working on growing coral in farms to later transplant in damaged areas.\nBecause of their water filtering abilities, coral reefs are also known to help keep the ocean water clean. Corals and sponges filter feed through the water by drawing water in through their pores, consuming the debris, and then releasing the newly filtered water back into the environment. Some studies have shown that sponges in reefs are able to capture sugar floating in the water, absorb them, and shed them to the seabed below feeding snails and bottom feeders. These bottom feeders become food for larger fish, continuing the food chain cycle that larger fish and even humans depend on for food [https://www.reefrelief.org/the-importance-of-coral-reefs/].\nCoral reefs, some of the Earth\u2019s most remarkable natural structures, have more than aesthetic significance. These tiny animals support lifestyles of thousands of other species, including the species that pose the greatest threat to corals: humans. Many reefs have lost 40-50% of their corals in the past 30 years. Spiny lobsters rely on coral reefs for protection, especially during their vulnerable molting episodes. Hawksbill sea turtles have become critically endangered species and are highly dependent on coral reefs for their food sources, mainly consisting of sponges. Many scientific studies have substantiated that dolphins and whales have extreme emotional intelligence. Sadly, their intellect won\u2019t be enough to help these animals if coral reefs are destroyed.

Those who poach the coral are taking this coral from private and protected areas. The marine life in these areas does not solely rely on the coral but it is a significant benefactor to the life that surrounds them. There are many substances that poachers use that are deadly to corals and the continued use of these poisons and smothers the coral. Coral is a sensitive species and toxic waste gives them no chance to survive and flourish in the ecosystem. Poaching of reef fish also contributes to a decrease of corals worldwide, because the fish graze the corals  which in turn keeps the corals healthy [https://scripps.ucsd.edu/projects/coralreefsystems/about-coral-reefs/value-of-corals/].\nIn some areas, coral reefs are a big tourist attraction. Losing the coral means losing money, and losing jobs in the community. For example, most of the estimated 5 million people who visit the Florida Keys each year contribute to the economy the coral reefs provide. The Keys average about 2.4 billion dollars in sales from tourism and ocean recreation. More than half of the jobs in the community depend on a healthy ocean to continue a successful tourist attraction [https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/news/dec19/noaa-launches-mission-iconic-reefs-to-save-florida-keys-coral-reefs.html].\nSince the illegal removal of coral across Asia has such a huge impact on the environment and marine life, government officials in Japan have started taking action against illegal poaching of coral in Japanese waters. Recently, Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinz\u014d Abe]] met with Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] in regards to taking action and making efforts against Chinese coral poachers working in Japanese waters.<ref>{{cite web|title=Abe Takes Coral Poaching Complaint Directly to Chinese President|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/abe-takes-coral-poaching-complaint-directly-to-chinese-president-1415716336}}</ref> The illegal removal of coral in the area is causing maritime tensions between these two nations due the high demand the Japanese coral jewelry in China. The main concern for the Japanese government regarding the illegal mining of coral is that coral mining creates a tremendous long-term loss to a society since the removal causes loss in fisheries significance, seaside security, and vacation industry in the area.\n\n== Prevention ==\nMany nations throughout the world are working towards preventing illegal poachers from mining coral in shallow-reef areas that harbor many marine wildlife and habitats. Japan punishes anyone illegally poaching coral in their waters by sentencing perpetrators to up to six months imprisonment or a \u00a5300,000 fine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Japan Arrests Chinese Fishing boat skipper over Coral Poaching|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/10/27/national/japan-arrests-chinese-fishing-boat-skipper-over-coral-poaching/#.VFzCy_nF_HV}}</ref> In the United States, a group known as SeaWeb has worked with other agencies to prevent illegal poaching as well as the preservation of coral colonies.\n\nSome possible methods to eliminate the illegal removal of precious coral colonies include: <ref name=PDF />\n*Improve guidelines of coral reef trade that requires demonstration of maintainable use and assortment, for both domestic and international trade.\n*Establish \"no-take\" Marine Protected Areas as environmental reserves.\n*Create administration plans that limit harvesting to a supportable level.\n*Prevent destruction of coral reefs through legal action and execution.\n*Encourage certification schemes which give sustainable gathered coral products a market benefit, such as the Marine Aquarium Council (MAC).\n*Teach consumers of coral reef products and the consequences of their choices.\n*Educate resident communities on maintainable fishing procedures and alternative livings.\n\nPreventing fisherman from illegally harvesting coral in many parts of the world, will allow coral colonies to repopulate and provide the necessary ecosystems for many marine life forms that depend on corals for survival.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Wildlife management]]\n*[[Wildlife smuggling]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Poaching]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Corallo vivo.jpg|thumb|Red Coral]]\n'''Coral poaching''' is the confiscation of highly [[Precious coral|valued coral]] species from [[protected area]]s for sale as many types of [[jewellery]] that could be sold of upwards to $1,800 per gram.

The substance is thought to be endowed with enigmatic sanctified properties as well as thought to bring about many cures and remedies. Unfortunately due to these beliefs, coral has been harvested for centuries being passed around and traded well-throughout Eastern Asia.\n\nSince the 8th century, people have poached coral from marine ecosystems in an effort to sell it as jewelry. Coral [[poaching]] is one of the most major environmental issues in Asia which continues to destroy many valuable ecosystems and habitats. {{As of|2015}}, it is estimated that about 18.7% of [[coral reef]]s are taken care of by [[marine protected area]]s and only 2% of these areas are satisfactory enough to prevent further degradation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coral Reef Conservation|url=http://www.coml.org/discoveries/trends/coral_reef_conservation}}</ref> It is estimated that about $230,000,000 dollars is generated annually from illegal coral poaching.<ref name=NH>{{cite journal|last1=Tsounis |first1=Georgios A.|title=Jewel of the deep: are the modern incarnations of age-old traditions--coral diving and craftsmanship--selling Mediterranean red coral out?|journal=Natural History|date=2009|volume=118|pages=30}}</ref> This causes a significant loss of value in the area being poached and has a damaging effect of the marine wildlife that lives in the area.

Often, coral is poached by [[Fisherman|fishermen]] from China, India, or Japan claiming to be on legitimate fishing trips. Divers on these boats will then go down and harvest the coral. The coral will then be taken to be cured and refined into jewelry, which is then sold on the market.

Some uses of these compounds go into medicine that is used for treatments against cancer, arthritis, heart disease, bacterial infections, viruses and asthma.The breeding grounds for fish, and chemical properties that coral reefs provide make up for a commercial value estimated by the National Marine Fisheries Service to be over $100 million [https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/marine-life-education-resources/coral-reef-ecosystems].\n\n== Effects on the environment ==\nMost coral colonies that are harvested take a long time to recover and the effect on the ecosystem surrounding it can be tremendous. It is believed that about one-third of coral reefs worldwide are damaged beyond repair and the rest is under critical condition and threat.

Coastlines and fish are known to be protected and preserved by the presence of coral reefs [https://sanctuaries.noaa.gov/news/dec19/noaa-launches-mission-iconic-reefs-to-save-florida-keys-coral-reefs.html] Coastlines become vulnerable when the power of the open ocean is no longer being dissipated by the structure that coral reefs provide.There are many towns and cities that depend on the defense of coral reefs on their shores, such as Florida Keys, where the shore is lined with homes and businesses. Without the coral reef, the buildings could be at great risk of water damage due to erosion of the shore line. Reefs are also critical to marine biodiversity. Up to 25% of the entire oceans marine life is found in a coral reef ecosystem, and up to 7,000 species depend on the reefs to survive [https://www.noaa.gov/education/resource-collections/marine-life-education-resources/coral-reef-ecosystems]. Scientists are now working on growing coral in farms to later transplant in damaged areas.\nBecause of their water filtering abilities, coral reefs are also known to help keep the ocean water clean.
