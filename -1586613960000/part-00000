([[G.P. Putnam's Sons]])]]\n\n'''''Battle Cry''''' is a [[novel]] by [[United States|American]] writer [[Leon Uris]], published in 1953. Many of the events in the book are based on Uris's own [[World War II]] experience with the [[6th Marine Regiment (United States)|6th Marine Regiment]].<ref>http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/battle-cry-leon-uris/1100609525</ref> \nThe story is largely told in [[First-person narrative|first person]] from the viewpoint of the Battalion Communications Chief, \"Mac,\" although it frequently shifts to [[Third-person narrative|third person]] in scenes where Mac is not personally present.\n\nThe characters in the book come from a variety of backgrounds, and cover a broad range of American archetypes.  The interaction of the characters as they learn to put aside their [[prejudice]]s and biases to bond, developing ''[[esprit de corps]]'', is a primary theme of the novel.\n* \"Mac\": A Master Tech Sergeant, a career Marine with 30 years of service in the Corps, and the Battalion Communications Chief. He gives his name only as \"Mac.\" He is the book's primary narrator and provides much of the old hand viewpoint of the story, also providing perspective on changes in the Marine Corps during the war.\n* Daniel \"Danny\" Forester: An [[All America|All-American]] boy from [[Baltimore]]. While the book does not have one central character, the story tends to focus on Danny more than anyone else. He leaves high school before graduation and gives up a scholarship to [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] to join the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] when the [[Pacific War|war]] breaks out; goes through Boot Camp and becomes a member of 2nd Battalion's radio squad.\n* Lamont Quincy \"L.Q.\" Jones: The unit's clown, from [[Los Angeles]]. He goes through Boot Camp with Danny and is assigned to the radio squad.\n* Constantine \"Ski\" Zvonski: A street youth from [[Philadelphia]], from a [[Polish Americans|Polish]] immigrant family. He also goes through Boot Camp with Danny and LQ, and is assigned to the radio squad.\n* Marion \"Sister Mary\" Hodgekiss: A small town boy and the unit's intellectual, with a fondness for classical music and poetry, particularly [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]. Aspires to be a writer. A member of the radio squad.\n* Cyril \"Seabags\" Brown: A farm boy from [[Iowa]] who refers to everybody as \"Cousin.\" A member of the radio squad.\n* Mortimer \"Speedy\" Gray: A [[cowboy]] type from [[Texas]]. A member of the radio squad. The most openly [[racism|racist]] character in the unit. His attitude toward certain other men, particularly Pedro Rojas and Jake Levin, is the source of significant interpersonal conflict.\n* Andrew \"Andy\" Hookans: A [[lumberjack]] from [[Washington (state)|Washington]], the \"big dumb [[Swedish Americans|Swede]].\" A member of the radio squad.\n* Shining Lighttower: A [[Navajo]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]. Lighttower occasionally plays on the Indian stereotype, talking in native [[pidgin]] and asking if he could go home to \"the [[Navajo Nation|reservation]].\" A member of the radio squad.\n* Joseph \"Spanish Joe\" Gomez: A [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]], the radio squad's troublemaker and slacker.\n* Jacob \"Jake\" Levin: A replacement from [[Brooklyn]] who joins the radio squad after [[Battle of Guadalcanal|Guadalcanal]].\n* Pedro Rojas: A [[Hospital corpsman|Navy hospital corpsman]] assigned to Headquarter's Company. From Texas, the son of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican]] migrant laborers. He is a Pharmacist's Mate who dreams of becoming a doctor.\n* Major Samuel \"Highpockets\" Huxley: The Battalion Commander.\n* Ziltch: The Battalion Commander's orderly.\n* Marine [[Marine gunner#Marine Corps|Gunner]] Jack Keats: Another old hand and the Battalion Communications Officer.\n* Captain Max Shapiro: Company Commander of Fox Company.\n* First Lieutenant Bryce: Headquarter's Company commander.\n* Staff Sergeant Burnside: Another old hand, squad leader of the radio squad.\n* Gunnery Sergeant McQuade: Another old hand in the Corps, Company Gunnery Sergeant for Fox Company and friend of Mac and Burnside.\n* First Sergeant Pucchi: Another old hand and the Headquarters Company First Sergeant.\n* Milton \"Professor\" Norton: A fellow recruit at Boot Camp, Norton was an instructor at the University of Pennsylvania prior to joining the Marines.

Later becomes a [[Shooting range|rifle range]] instructor.\n* Kathleen \"Kathy\" Walker: Danny's high school sweetheart.\n* Elaine Yarbourough: An older woman Danny has an affair with, the wife of a Navy officer.\n* Susan: Ski's girlfriend.\n* Rae: A woman that Hodgekiss falls in love with.\n* Pat Rogers: A [[New Zealand]] woman that Andy falls in love with.\n \nThe book tells the story of how this diverse group came together to form an effective team, as well as describing the battles they fought in, including the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]], [[Battle of Tarawa|Tarawa]] and the [[Battle of Saipan]].

Also described is their boot camp experiences in San Diego and their two assignments to US Marine camps in New Zealand, the first time for preparatory training for the [[Battle of Guadalcanal]] and then back again for rest and recovery before the [[Tarawa]] campaign.

The population of the village Lauterbrunnen is less than that of Wengen, but larger than that of the others.\n\n==Toponymy==\nLauterbrunnen was first mentioned in 1240 as ''\"in claro fonte\"'', a [[Romance language]] place name meaning \"clear spring\".{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} By 1253, it was known to [[German language|German]] speakers as ''Liuterbrunnon''; the town had an alternate spelling of ''Luterbrunnen'' by 1268.<ref name=HDS/> While the meaning of ''brunnen'' is undoubtedly [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] or fountain, there is some dispute about the meaning of ''lauter''. Some translate it as clear, clean or bright (which compares to the earlier Romance language meaning of the place mentioned above), while others translate it as \"many\" or \"louder\". A local explanation is that the name Lauterbrunnen means \"many springs\", using a modern meaning of the word ''lauter'' in German; however, this could be an example of a [[folk etymology]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sommer, Giorgio (1834-1914) - n. 12816 - Lauterbrunnenthal.jpg|thumb|left|Lauterbrunnen Valley in the late 19th or early 20th century.]]\n[[File:Jungfraubahn Bohrarbeiten um 1900 (01).jpg|thumb|left|Miners working on the Jungfraubahn]]\nLauterbrunnen is first mentioned in 1240 as ''in claro fonte''. In 1304 it was mentioned as ''Luterbrunnen''.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThe oldest trace of a settlement in the area is a single [[Switzerland in the Roman era|Roman]] coin which was discovered in the Blumental.\n\nWhen the Lauterbrunnen Valley first appears in the historic record, during the 13th century, it was owned by the [[Freiherr]] of W\u00e4denswil. In 1240 the Freiherr of W\u00e4denswil sold the Sefinen Valley to [[Interlaken Monastery]]. Over the following century, the Monastery and other local lords began to expand their power in the Lauterbrunnen and neighboring valleys. However, around 1300, the Lord of Turn began to settle his [[Walser German|Walser]] speaking people in the nearby L\u00f6tschen Valley and into the highlands of the Lauterbrunnen Valley. By 1346, the Walser villages of Lauterbrunnen, Gimmelwald, M\u00fcrren, Sichellauenen and Trachsellauenen all had village governments and a certain amount of independence from the Monastery. Three years later, much of the [[Bernese Oberland]] unsuccessfully rose up against Monastery. When the Monastery suppressed the rebellion, the Walser villages bore the brunt of the Monastery's wrath.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nBy the 15th century, the villages of the valley were part of the large [[parish]] of Gsteig bei Interlaken (now part of [[Gsteigwiler]]). In 1487-88 the villagers in Lauterbrunnen built a [[filial church]] of the parish. In 1506, the parish appointed a full-time priest for Lauterbrunnen. In 1528, the city of [[Bern]] adopted the new faith of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and began imposing it on the [[Bernese Oberland]]. Lauterbrunnen joined many other villages and the Monastery in an unsuccessful rebellion against the new faith. After Bern imposed its will on the Oberland, they secularized the Monastery and annexed all the Monastery lands. Lauterbrunnen became the center of a new Reformed parish.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nMines were built in the Trachsellauenen area in the upper valley beginning in the late 16th century. An iron [[smelter]] was built in Zweil\u00fctschinen (now part of [[G\u00fcndlischwand]]) in 1715 to process the iron ore from Trachsellauenen. However most of the money from the mines went to the noble landowners. The villagers remained very poor. In the 17th and 18th centuries the poverty was so widespread that many of the villagers joined mercenary regiments or emigrated. A majority of the emigrants moved to the Carolinas in the United States. Beginning in the late 18th century, foreign mountain climbers began to use Lauterbrunnen as a starting point for their expeditions into the nearby Alps. Initially the climbers stayed in the village [[rectory]]. However, as Lauterbrunnen's fame grew and with the completion of a road from Interlaken in 1834 and the 1890 [[Bernese Oberland Railway]], more hotels were needed for tourists. As new hotels were built, other tourist infrastructure was also built in the village. They built cable cars to M\u00fcrren in 1891 and to Wengen in 1893. But the most significant piece of infrastructure was the [[Jungfrau railway]] which was built in 1912. The Jungfrau [[rack railway]] runs {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Kleine Scheidegg]] to the highest railway station in Europe at [[Jungfraujoch]]. The railway runs almost entirely within a tunnel built into the [[Eiger]] and [[M\u00f6nch]] mountains and contains two stations in the middle of the tunnel, where passengers can disembark to observe the neighboring mountains through windows built into the mountainside. In 1909 the English brothers Walter and Arnold Lunn popularized skiing, curling and bobsledding at Lauterbrunnen. These winter sports provided a whole new group of winter tourists and converted the summer tourist industry into a year-round business. The tourist economy of Lauterbrunnen was devastated due to World War I and II and the [[Great Depression]]. However, following the end of World War II, tourism rebounded. Many new vacation homes and chalets were built along with ski lifts, chair lifts and a heliport.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nOn 1 January 1973 the former municipality of Isenfluh merged into the municipality of Lauterbrunnen. On 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Interlaken, the municipality's former district, was dissolved. On the following day, 1 January 2010, it joined the newly created Verwaltungskreis Interlaken-Oberhasli.<ref name=Mutation>[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/02.html Nomenklaturen \u2013 Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz] {{in lang|de}} accessed 9 February 2013</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:LauterbrunnenValley.jpg|thumb|right|View of the valley from the [[M\u00e4nnlichen]]]]\nLauterbrunnen lies at the bottom of a U-shaped valley that extends south and then south-westwards from the village to meet the {{convert|8|km|mi|sp=us}} [[Lauterbrunnen Wall]]. The Lauterbrunnen Valley (''Lauterbrunnental'') is one of the deepest in the Alpine chain when compared with the height of the mountains that rise directly on either side. It is a true cleft, rarely more than one kilometre in width, between limestone precipices, sometimes quite perpendicular, everywhere of extreme steepness. It is to this form of the valley that it owes the numerous waterfalls from which it derives its name. The streams descending from the adjoining mountains, on reaching the verge of the rocky walls of the valley, form cascades so high that they are almost lost in spray before they reach the level of the valley. The most famous of these is [[Staubbach Falls]], less than one kilometre from the village of Lauterbrunnen. The height of the cascade is between {{convert|800|and|900|ft|m|order=flip}}, one of the highest in Europe formed of a single unbroken fall.<ref>[[John Ball (naturalist)|John Ball]], ''The Alpine guide, Central Alps'', p. 75, 1866, London</ref>\n\n''[[L\u00fctschine|Weisse L\u00fctschine]]'' river flows through Lauterbrunnen and overflows its banks about once a year. The source of the river comes from melting snow high in the mountains, thus making it a very pure and clean source of water. It is common practice in camp sites to chill drinks in the water. [[Trummelbach Falls]] is {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Lauterbrunnen, connected by bus from the station.<ref>Trummelbach Falls tourist literature</ref>\n\nThe municipality of Lauterbrunnen extends a considerable distance beyond the village and valley, with an area of {{Swiss area|0584|mi=on}}. It reaches as far as the peaks of the [[Eiger]], [[M\u00f6nch]] and [[Jungfrau]] to the east, the [[Gletscherhorn]], [[Mittaghorn]], [[Grosshorn]], [[Breithorn (Lauterbrunnen)|Breithorn]] and [[Tschingelhorn]] to the south, and the [[Gspaltenhorn]] and [[Schilthorn]] to the west. The [[Kleine Scheidegg Pass]] crosses over to [[Grindelwald]] to the east, whilst the [[Sefinenfurgge Pass]] crosses to [[Griesalp]] and [[Reichenbach im Kandertal]] to the west. Both passes carry hiking trails that form part of the [[Alpine Pass Route]], a long-distance hiking trail across Switzerland between [[Sargans]] and [[Montreux]]. Besides the village of Lauterbrunnen, the municipality also includes the villages of Wengen, M\u00fcrren, Gimmelwald, Stechelberg, and Isenfluh.{{Swiss area data|0584|QUELLE}}<!--164.56 - 164.41 km2--><ref name=swtopo>{{cite map | publisher = Swiss Confederation | title = map.geo.admin.ch | url = http://map.geo.admin.ch/?zoom=5&X=155891.76&Y=634169.32&lang=en&topic=ech&bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&catalogNodes=457,510&layers=ch.swisstopo.swissboundaries3d-gemeinde-flaeche.fill | accessdate = 2015-05-18}}</ref><ref name=tita10>{{cite book | title = Trekking in the Alps | first = Kev | last = Reynolds | pages = 124\u2013135 | chapter = Trek 10 - Alpine Pass Route | publisher = Cicerone | year = 2011 | isbn = 978 1 85284 600 8}}</ref>\n\nOf the municipal area, {{convert|36.79|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 22.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{convert|28.84|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 17.5% is forested.

Some translate it as clear, clean or bright (which compares to the earlier Romance language meaning of the place mentioned above), while others translate it as \"many\" or \"louder\". A local explanation is that the name Lauterbrunnen means \"many springs\", using a modern meaning of the word ''lauter'' in German; however, this could be an example of a [[folk etymology]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Sommer, Giorgio (1834-1914) - n. 12816 - Lauterbrunnenthal.jpg|thumb|left|Lauterbrunnen Valley in the late 19th or early 20th century.]]\n[[File:Jungfraubahn Bohrarbeiten um 1900 (01).jpg|thumb|left|Miners working on the Jungfraubahn]]\nLauterbrunnen is first mentioned in 1240 as ''in claro fonte''.

Over the following century, the Monastery and other local lords began to expand their power in the Lauterbrunnen and neighboring valleys. However, around 1300, the Lord of Turn began to settle his [[Walser German|Walser]] speaking people in the nearby L\u00f6tschen Valley and into the highlands of the Lauterbrunnen Valley. By 1346, the Walser villages of Lauterbrunnen, Gimmelwald, M\u00fcrren, Sichellauenen and Trachsellauenen all had village governments and a certain amount of independence from the Monastery. Three years later, much of the [[Bernese Oberland]] unsuccessfully rose up against Monastery. When the Monastery suppressed the rebellion, the Walser villages bore the brunt of the Monastery's wrath.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nBy the 15th century, the villages of the valley were part of the large [[parish]] of Gsteig bei Interlaken (now part of [[Gsteigwiler]]). In 1487-88 the villagers in Lauterbrunnen built a [[filial church]] of the parish. In 1506, the parish appointed a full-time priest for Lauterbrunnen. In 1528, the city of [[Bern]] adopted the new faith of the [[Protestant Reformation]] and began imposing it on the [[Bernese Oberland]]. Lauterbrunnen joined many other villages and the Monastery in an unsuccessful rebellion against the new faith. After Bern imposed its will on the Oberland, they secularized the Monastery and annexed all the Monastery lands. Lauterbrunnen became the center of a new Reformed parish.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nMines were built in the Trachsellauenen area in the upper valley beginning in the late 16th century. An iron [[smelter]] was built in Zweil\u00fctschinen (now part of [[G\u00fcndlischwand]]) in 1715 to process the iron ore from Trachsellauenen. However most of the money from the mines went to the noble landowners. The villagers remained very poor. In the 17th and 18th centuries the poverty was so widespread that many of the villagers joined mercenary regiments or emigrated. A majority of the emigrants moved to the Carolinas in the United States. Beginning in the late 18th century, foreign mountain climbers began to use Lauterbrunnen as a starting point for their expeditions into the nearby Alps. Initially the climbers stayed in the village [[rectory]]. However, as Lauterbrunnen's fame grew and with the completion of a road from Interlaken in 1834 and the 1890 [[Bernese Oberland Railway]], more hotels were needed for tourists. As new hotels were built, other tourist infrastructure was also built in the village. They built cable cars to M\u00fcrren in 1891 and to Wengen in 1893. But the most significant piece of infrastructure was the [[Jungfrau railway]] which was built in 1912. The Jungfrau [[rack railway]] runs {{convert|9|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Kleine Scheidegg]] to the highest railway station in Europe at [[Jungfraujoch]]. The railway runs almost entirely within a tunnel built into the [[Eiger]] and [[M\u00f6nch]] mountains and contains two stations in the middle of the tunnel, where passengers can disembark to observe the neighboring mountains through windows built into the mountainside. In 1909 the English brothers Walter and Arnold Lunn popularized skiing, curling and bobsledding at Lauterbrunnen. These winter sports provided a whole new group of winter tourists and converted the summer tourist industry into a year-round business. The tourist economy of Lauterbrunnen was devastated due to World War I and II and the [[Great Depression]]. However, following the end of World War II, tourism rebounded. Many new vacation homes and chalets were built along with ski lifts, chair lifts and a heliport.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nOn 1 January 1973 the former municipality of Isenfluh merged into the municipality of Lauterbrunnen. On 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Interlaken, the municipality's former district, was dissolved. On the following day, 1 January 2010, it joined the newly created Verwaltungskreis Interlaken-Oberhasli.<ref name=Mutation>[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/infothek/nomenklaturen/blank/blank/gem_liste/02.html Nomenklaturen \u2013 Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz] {{in lang|de}} accessed 9 February 2013</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:LauterbrunnenValley.jpg|thumb|right|View of the valley from the [[M\u00e4nnlichen]]]]\nLauterbrunnen lies at the bottom of a U-shaped valley that extends south and then south-westwards from the village to meet the {{convert|8|km|mi|sp=us}} [[Lauterbrunnen Wall]]. The Lauterbrunnen Valley (''Lauterbrunnental'') is one of the deepest in the Alpine chain when compared with the height of the mountains that rise directly on either side. It is a true cleft, rarely more than one kilometre in width, between limestone precipices, sometimes quite perpendicular, everywhere of extreme steepness. It is to this form of the valley that it owes the numerous waterfalls from which it derives its name. The streams descending from the adjoining mountains, on reaching the verge of the rocky walls of the valley, form cascades so high that they are almost lost in spray before they reach the level of the valley. The most famous of these is [[Staubbach Falls]], less than one kilometre from the village of Lauterbrunnen. The height of the cascade is between {{convert|800|and|900|ft|m|order=flip}}, one of the highest in Europe formed of a single unbroken fall.<ref>[[John Ball (naturalist)|John Ball]], ''The Alpine guide, Central Alps'', p. 75, 1866, London</ref>\n\n''[[L\u00fctschine|Weisse L\u00fctschine]]'' river flows through Lauterbrunnen and overflows its banks about once a year. The source of the river comes from melting snow high in the mountains, thus making it a very pure and clean source of water. It is common practice in camp sites to chill drinks in the water. [[Trummelbach Falls]] is {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Lauterbrunnen, connected by bus from the station.<ref>Trummelbach Falls tourist literature</ref>\n\nThe municipality of Lauterbrunnen extends a considerable distance beyond the village and valley, with an area of {{Swiss area|0584|mi=on}}. It reaches as far as the peaks of the [[Eiger]], [[M\u00f6nch]] and [[Jungfrau]] to the east, the [[Gletscherhorn]], [[Mittaghorn]], [[Grosshorn]], [[Breithorn (Lauterbrunnen)|Breithorn]] and [[Tschingelhorn]] to the south, and the [[Gspaltenhorn]] and [[Schilthorn]] to the west. The [[Kleine Scheidegg Pass]] crosses over to [[Grindelwald]] to the east, whilst the [[Sefinenfurgge Pass]] crosses to [[Griesalp]] and [[Reichenbach im Kandertal]] to the west. Both passes carry hiking trails that form part of the [[Alpine Pass Route]], a long-distance hiking trail across Switzerland between [[Sargans]] and [[Montreux]]. Besides the village of Lauterbrunnen, the municipality also includes the villages of Wengen, M\u00fcrren, Gimmelwald, Stechelberg, and Isenfluh.{{Swiss area data|0584|QUELLE}}<!--164.56 - 164.41 km2--><ref name=swtopo>{{cite map | publisher = Swiss Confederation | title = map.geo.admin.ch | url = http://map.geo.admin.ch/?zoom=5&X=155891.76&Y=634169.32&lang=en&topic=ech&bgLayer=ch.swisstopo.pixelkarte-farbe&catalogNodes=457,510&layers=ch.swisstopo.swissboundaries3d-gemeinde-flaeche.fill | accessdate = 2015-05-18}}</ref><ref name=tita10>{{cite book | title = Trekking in the Alps | first = Kev | last = Reynolds | pages = 124\u2013135 | chapter = Trek 10 - Alpine Pass Route | publisher = Cicerone | year = 2011 | isbn = 978 1 85284 600 8}}</ref>\n\nOf the municipal area, {{convert|36.79|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 22.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while {{convert|28.84|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} or 17.5% is forested.

Tillotson adds that no evidence is offered by Oak to redate it to thirteen centuries earlier. He adds that the technical know-how to construct structural buildings didn't exist in pre-Mughal India, the only surviving architecture being rock-cut or monolithic. He points that Oak later dropped this claim and claimed it to be from 12th century. He adds that Oak claims Mughals built nothing and only converted Hindu buildings.

He states that Oak interprets the statements of ''[[Padshahnama]]'' about Shah Jahan's purchase of the land for the Taj from [[Jai Singh I]] upon where a mansion built by an ancestor of the Raja earlier existed, to claim that Taj Mahal was a wonder of ancient Hinduism. Tillotson adds that no evidence is offered by Oak to redate it to thirteen centuries earlier. He adds that the technical know-how to construct structural buildings didn't exist in pre-Mughal India, the only surviving architecture being rock-cut or monolithic. He points that Oak later dropped this claim and claimed it to be from 12th century. He adds that Oak claims Mughals built nothing and only converted Hindu buildings. In relation to similarity with buildings of [[West Asia]], Oak also claims them all to be \"products of Hindu architecture\".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q4zYd848UJkC&pg=PA115|author=Giles Tillotson|title=Taj Mahal|pages=112\u2013114|publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]|year=2008|author-link=Giles Tillotson|isbn=9780674031869}}</ref>\n===Kaaba Theory: Vedic origins===\n{{See also|Kaaba#Pre-Islamic Era}}\nIn a 13-page pamphlet titled ''Was Kaaba a Hindu Temple?'', Oak derives a claim of a \"Vedic past of Arabia\" based on an inscription mentioning the legendary Indian king [[Vikram\u0101ditya]] that Oak claims was found inside a dish inside the Kaaba.

cytokine release after a drug challenge later in life compared to controls who were not neonatally infected.<ref name=\":12\" /> Following findings from her postdoctoral work highlighting [[Interleukin 1 beta|IL-1B]] dysregulation after neonatal infection, Bilbo explored a mechanistic understanding of immune dysregulation after early-life infection. She further wanted to explore how this dysfunction is unmasked after a second immune challenge later in life.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Williamson|first=Lauren L.|last2=Sholar|first2=Paige

be the cell type orchestrating these neurobiological changes by holding a memory of early-life infection in the form of increased sensitivity.<ref name=\":13\" /> Bilbo found that early infection sensitizes microglia such that upon a second environmental challenge, microglia become easily activated and release large amounts of IL-1B which leads to learning and memory impairments.<ref name=\":13\" />\n\nContinuing to explore the biology of microglia in the developing brain, Bilbo published a paper in 2011 characterizing microglia colonization, number, and function in males and females during brain development.<ref name=\":14\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwarz|first=Jaclyn M.|last2=Sholar|first2=Paige W.|last3=Bilbo|first3=Staci D.|date=2012|title=Sex differences in microglial

microglia and astrocytes after an immune insult highlighting the robust influence the environment can have on neuroimmune homeostasis and thus neural function.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n===== Drug Addiction and Neuroimmune Involvement =====\nBilbo\u2019s work has also highlighted that adolescent exposure to [[morphine]] changes long-term microglial gene expression.<ref name=\"Schwarz 961\u2013971\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwarz|first=Jaclyn M.|last2=Bilbo|first2=Staci D.|date=2013-01-16|title=Adolescent Morphine Exposure Affects Long-Term Microglial Function and Later-Life Relapse

after adolescent exposure to morphine and this causes microglia to become sensitized and more easily activated upon a second exposure to morphine.<ref name=\"Schwarz 961\u2013971\"/> After Bilbo moved to [[Harvard University|Harvard]], she published a paper in Neuropsychopharmacology exploring the role of early-life anti-inflammatory signalling on the development of drug addiction in adulthood.<ref

early in life, which she had previously found lead to anti-inflammatory immune signalling, attenuates intravenous self-administration later in life.<ref name=\":16\" /> Bilbo and her colleagues found that there were decreases in pro-inflammatory markers in the nucleus accumbens and further that administration of IL-10 DNA, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, also attenuates self-administration.<ref name=\":16\" /> Her findings suggest a novel role for immune regulation in the reinforcing effects of opioids.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n==== Environmental Pollutants and Neuroimmune Activation ====\nAnother novel finding that Bilbo made while at Duke was that environmental pollutant exposure, specifically to diesel exhaust particles (DEP), during critical periods of prenatal development sensitizes microglia leading to increased susceptibility of offspring to diet-induced metabolic, behavioral, and neuroinflammatory changes in adulthood.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bolton|first=Jessica
