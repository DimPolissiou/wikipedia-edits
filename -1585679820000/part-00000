Its depiction of Captain Nemo's underwater ship, the ''Nautilus'', is regarded as ahead of its time, since it accurately describes many features of today's [[submarines]], which in the 1860s were comparatively primitive vessels.\n\nA model of the [[French submarine Plongeur|French submarine ''Plongeur'']] (launched in 1863) figured at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], where Jules Verne examined it <ref>Payen, J.

This distinction becomes clearer when the book's French title is correctly translated: rendered literally, it should read \u201cTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\u201d (not \u201cSea\u201d).  The book employs metric leagues, which are four kilometers each.<ref>F. P. Walter's Project Gutenberg translation of Part 2, Chapter 7, reads: \"Accordingly, our speed was 25 miles (that is, twelve four\u2013kilometer leagues) per hour. Needless to say, Ned Land had to give up his escape plans, much to his distress. Swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second, he could hardly make use of the skiff.\"</ref>\n\n==Plot==    \nDuring the year 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterious [[sea monster]], which, it's later suggested, might be a gigantic [[narwhal]]. The U.S. government assembles an expedition in [[New York City]] to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] and the story's narrator, is in town just then and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition; he accepts. [[Canadians|Canadian]] whaler and master [[harpoon]]er Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.\n\nThe expedition leaves Manhattan's 34th St. Pier aboard the [[U.S. Navy]] frigate ''Abraham Lincoln'', then travels south around [[Cape Horn]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. The three protagonists are hurled into the sea and ultimately climb onto the monster itself, which they are startled to find is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they're captured, hauled inside, and introduced to the submarine's mysterious manufacturer and commander, [[Captain Nemo]].\n\nThe rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard the  ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation: a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to take revenge on terrestrial [[civilization]]. Nemo explains that his submarine is [[electric power|electrically powered]] and can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he can't let them leave \u2014 they must remain on board permanently. Professor Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the prospect of undersea exploration, but Ned Land increasingly hungers to escape.\n\nThey visit many ocean regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers view [[coral]] formations, sunken vessels from the [[battle of Vigo Bay]], the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] ice barrier, the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]], and the legendary underwater realm of [[Atlantis]]. The passengers also don [[diving suit]]s, hunt [[shark]]s and other marine fauna with air guns in the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and also attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by the ''Nautilus''. When the submarine returns to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], a school of \"poulpes\" attacks the vessel and kills a crewman. (In French \"poulpe\" is a generic term for a cephalopod, such as a [[cuttlefish]], [[octopus]], etc. \u2014 the noun \"devilfish\" is a close English equivalent. Verne's text specifies that the monster in this case is \"un calmar de dimensions colossales\", \"a squid of colossal dimensions\", i.e, a [[giant squid]].) \n\nThe novel's later pages suggest that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. Ultimately, the ''Nautilus'' is  attacked by a warship from the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his quest for revenge, Nemo \u2014 whom Aronnax dubs an \"archangel of hatred\" \u2014 rams the ship below her waterline and sends her to the bottom, much to the professor's horror. Afterward, Nemo kneels before a portrait of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression. \n\nCircumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned  becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning, however,  Ned announces that they're in sight of land and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now horrifies him. Yet he's still drawn to the man, fears that Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, and therefore avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, however, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him calling out in anguish, \"O almighty God! Enough! Enough!\" Aronnax immediately joins his companions, and they carry out their escape plans. But as they board the submarine's skiff, they realize that the ''Nautilus'' has seemingly blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, the [[Moskenstraumen]], more commonly known as the \"Maelstrom\". Nevertheless they manage to escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine's ultimate fate, however, remains unknown.\n\n==Themes and subtext==\n[[File:20000 map 1.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Pacific]]\n[[File:20000 map 2.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Atlantic]]\nCaptain Nemo's assumed name recalls Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', a Greek [[Epic poetry|epic poem]]. In ''The Odyssey'', Odysseus meets the monstrous [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] during the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that his name is \"Utis\" (\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2), which translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". In the [[Latin]] translation of the ''Odyssey'', this [[pseudonym]] is rendered as \"''Nemo''\", which also translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for 10 years) and likewise grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.\n\nVerne's text repeatedly mentions U.S. Naval Commander [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], an actual oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the  depths, and charted the world's oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.\n\nThe novel alludes to other Frenchmen, such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse]], a celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation; [[Dumont d'Urville]], a later explorer who found remnants of one of Lap\u00e9rouse's ships; and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], builder of the [[Suez Canal]] and a nephew of the sole survivor of Lap\u00e9rouse's ill-fated expedition. The ''Nautilus'' follows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lap\u00e9rouse's vessels disappeared; she enters Torres Strait and becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, the ''Astrolabe''; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn one of the novel's most famous episodes, the above-cited battle with a school of [[giant squid]], one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: \"To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author of ''The Toilers of the Sea''.\" A bestselling novel in Verne's day, ''[[The Toilers of the Sea]]'' also features a threatening cephalopod: a worker battles with an octopus, believed by  critics to be symbolic of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Certainly Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in the [[Revolutions of 1848]].\n\nOther symbols and themes pique modern critics. [[Margaret Drabble]], for instance, argues that Verne's  masterwork also anticipated the [[ecology movement]] and influenced French [[avant-garde]] imagery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/04/submarine-dreams |title=Submarine dreams: Jules Verne's ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' |work=New Statesman |author=[[Margaret Drabble]] |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}</ref> \n\nAs for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain supplies financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869]], proving to Professor Aronnax that he hadn't severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues an East Indian [[pearl diver]] from a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. Nemo remarks later that the diver, as a native of British Colonial India, \"lives in the land of the oppressed\".\n\nIndeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was a [[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]], whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the Polish [[January Uprising]] of 1863. However, these specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the behest of Verne's publisher, [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]], believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of the [[Russian Empire]], hence Hetzel insisted on Verne's suppressing the identity of Nemo's enemy, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hetzel was a thoroughly commercial publisher ... hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins. \n\nEven so, there's still a trace of the novel's original concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion engineered by an earlier Polish hero \u2014 [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]], leader of the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising|uprising against Russia in 1794]], a Polish national hero who mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation \"Finis Poloniae!\" (\"[[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] is no more!\").\n\nFive years later, and at Hetzel's urging, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''. It revises the captain's nationality from Polish to East Indian, changing him into a fictional descendant of [[Tipu Sultan]], Muslim ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] who resisted the expansionism of the British [[East India Company]]. Nemo's unnamed enemy is thus converted into France's old antagonist, the [[British Empire]]. Born as an Indian aristocrat, one  Prince Dakkar, Nemo participated in a major 19th century uprising, the [[Indian Rebellion]] of 1857, ultimately quashed by the United Kingdom. After his family members were slain by the British, Nemo fled underseas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages. \n\n[[Image:LePlongeurModel(Side).jpg|thumb|Model of the 1863 [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Marine]], [[Paris]].]]\n[[File:Nautilus Neuville.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'' as imagined by [[Jules Verne]].]]\nVerne took the name \"Nautilus\" from one of the [[Nautilus (1800 submarine)|earliest successful submarines]], built in 1800 by [[Robert Fulton]], who also invented the first commercially successful [[steamboat]]. Fulton named his submarine after a marine mollusk, the chambered [[nautilus]]. Three years before completing his book, Jules Verne also studied a model of the newly developed [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], which inspired him in his development of the novel's ''Nautilus''.<ref>Notice at the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, [[Rochefort (Charente-Maritime)|Rochefort]]</ref>\n\nThe breathing apparatus used by divers on the ''Nautilus'' is presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) the [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied]]<ref name=davis1955/> hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatus [[Timeline of diving technology#The first diving regulators|designed by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865]].<!-- image of the Rouquayrol and Denayrouze breathing apparatus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dykeri,_fig_6,_Nordisk_familjebok.png --> Their gear featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demand [[Diving regulator|regulator]].<ref name=davis1955>{{cite book |author=Davis, RH |title=Deep Diving and Submarine Operations |year=1955 |edition=6th |publisher=[[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd]] |location=Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey |page=693 |authorlink=Robert Davis (inventor) }}</ref>{{r|thomas196112}}<ref name=dive_hx>{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=A brief history of diving and decompression illness. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6004 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}</ref> The diver didn't swim but still walked on the seafloor. This device was called an ''a\u00e9rophore'' (Greek for \"air-carrier\"). Its air tanks could hold only 30 atmospheres, however Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: \"The ''Nautilus'''s pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.\"\n\n==Recurring themes in later books==\nAs noted above, Hetzel and Verne generated a sequel of sorts to this novel: ''L'\u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse'' (''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', 1874), which attempts to round off narratives begun in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' and ''Captain Grant's Children'', aka ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]''. While ''The Mysterious Island'' attempts to provide additional background on Nemo (or Prince Dakkar), it's muddled by irreconcilable chronological discrepancies between the two books and even within ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' itself.\n\nVerne returned to the theme of an outlaw submarine captain in his much later ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' (1896). This novel's chief villain, Ker Karraje, is a simply an unscrupulous pirate acting purely for personal gain, completely devoid of the saving graces that gave Captain Nemo some nobility of character. Like Nemo, Ker Karraje plays \"host\" to unwilling French guests \u2014 but unlike Nemo, who manages to elude all pursuers \u2014 Karraje's criminal career is decisively thwarted by the combination of an international task force and the resistance of his French captives. Though also widely published and translated, ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' never achieved the lasting popularity of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues''.\n\nCloser in approach to the original Nemo \u2014 though offering less detail and complexity of characterization \u2014 is the rebel aeronaut Robur in ''[[Robur the Conqueror]]'' and its sequel ''[[Master of the World (novel)|Master of the World]]''. Instead of the sea, Robur's medium is the sky: in these two novels he develops a pioneering helicopter and later a seaplane on wheels.\n\n==English translations==\nThe novel was first translated into English in 1873 by Reverend [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting  Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the French ''scaphandre'' \u2014 properly \"diving suit\" \u2014 as \"cork-jacket\", following a long-obsolete usage as \"a type of [[lifejacket]]\"). Some of these distortions may been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's deleting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally including [[Daniel O'Connell]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/sherwood/How_Lewis_Mercier.htm |title=How Lewis Mercier and Eleanor King brought you Jules Verne |publisher=Ibiblio.org |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> among other international figures. Nevertheless Mercier's text became the standard English translation, while other \"re-translations\" continued to reproduce its mistakes (including its mistranslation of the novel's title, which, in French, actually means ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'').\n\nA modern revision of Mercier's translation appeared in 1966, prepared by  Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press.<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans). ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', [[Washington Square Press]], 1966. Standard book number 671-46557-0; [[Library of Congress]] Catalog Card Number 65-25245.</ref> Miller addressed many of Mercier's errors in the volume's preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text proper.\n\nA few years prior, in 1962, Anthony Bonner had published an essentially complete translation of the novel for [[Bantam Classics]]. A specially written introduction by [[Ray Bradbury]], compared Captain Nemo to [[Captain Ahab]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.\n\nMercier's errors were again corrected in a fresh re-examination of the sources and a new translation by Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, published in 1993 by [[Naval Institute Press]] in a \"completely restored and annotated edition\".<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans), Frederick Paul Walter (trans). ''Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: A Completely Restored and Annotated Edition'', [[Naval Institute Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|1-55750-877-1}}</ref> Its text tapped into Walter's own unpublished translating work, which Project Gutenberg later made available online for readers only.\n\nIn 2010 Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater''. Complete with an introduction and extensive textual notes, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter's Verne translations entitled ''Amazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classics'' and published by [[State University of New York Press]].\n\nIn 1998 William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation from the French original, published by [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-953927-8}}, with the title ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas''. Butcher includes detailed notes, an extensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by his original publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a notorious 1961 article, [[Theodore L. Thomas]] denounced the novel, alleging that \"there is not a single bit of valid speculation\" in the book and that \"none of its predictions has come true\". He described its depictions of Nemo's diving gear, underwater activities, and the ''Nautilus'' as \"pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time.\" Even so, Thomas admitted that despite poor science, plot, and characterization, \"Put them all together with the magic of Verne's  story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it\".<ref name=\"thomas196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Thomas\n |first=Theodore L.\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=The Watery Wonders of Captain Nemo\n |department=\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n54/mode/1up \n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=168\u2013177\n |type=\n}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, Thomas's observations are held in low regard, having been comprehensively debunked in the 1993 Naval Institute Press edition cited above. Thomas had made the fundamental blunder of accepting the original translation's errors and deletions without referencing Verne's French. As the Naval Institute translation documents, every detail denounced by Thomas was actually perpetrated by Verne's first English translator, [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. \n \n==Adaptations and variations==\n{{main|Adaptations of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\nCaptain Nemo's nationality is presented in many [[feature film]] and video realizations as European. However, he's depicted as East Indian by [[Omar Sharif]] in the 1973 European [[miniseries]] ''[[La Isla misteriosa y el capit\u00e1n Nemo|The Mysterious Island]]''. Nemo also appears as an East Indian in the 1916 silent film version of the novel (which adds elements from ''The Mysterious Island'') and later in both the graphic novel and the film ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. In [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), a live-action Technicolor film of the novel, Captain Nemo seems European, albeit dark-complected. In the Disney adaptation, he's played by British actor [[James Mason]], with \u2014 as in the novel itself \u2014 no mention of his being East Indian. The film's script elaborates on background hints in Verne's original: in an effort to get at Nemo's scientific secrets, his wife and son were tortured to death by an unnamed government overseeing the fictional prison camp of Rorapandi. This is the captain's motivation for sinking warships in the film.

Its depiction of Captain Nemo's underwater ship, the ''Nautilus'', is regarded as ahead of its time, since it accurately describes many features of today's [[submarines]], which in the 1860s were comparatively primitive vessels.\n\nA model of the [[French submarine Plongeur|French submarine ''Plongeur'']] (launched in 1863) figured at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], where Jules Verne examined it <ref>Payen, J.

This distinction becomes clearer when the book's French title is correctly translated: rendered literally, it should read \u201cTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas\u201d (not \u201cSea\u201d).  The book employs metric leagues, which are four kilometers each.<ref>F. P. Walter's Project Gutenberg translation of Part 2, Chapter 7, reads: \"Accordingly, our speed was 25 miles (that is, twelve four\u2013kilometer leagues) per hour. Needless to say, Ned Land had to give up his escape plans, much to his distress. Swept along at the rate of twelve to thirteen meters per second, he could hardly make use of the skiff.\"</ref>\n\n==Plot==    \nDuring the year 1866, ships of various nationalities sight a mysterious [[sea monster]], which, it's later suggested, might be a gigantic [[narwhal]]. The U.S. government assembles an expedition in [[New York City]] to find and destroy the monster. Professor Pierre Aronnax, a French [[Marine biology|marine biologist]] and the story's narrator, is in town just then and receives a last-minute invitation to join the expedition; he accepts. [[Canadians|Canadian]] whaler and master [[harpoon]]er Ned Land and Aronnax's faithful manservant Conseil are also among the participants.\n\nThe expedition leaves Manhattan's 34th St. Pier aboard the [[U.S. Navy]] frigate ''Abraham Lincoln'', then travels south around [[Cape Horn]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]]. After a five-month search ending off Japan, the frigate locates and attacks the monster, which damages the ship's rudder. The three protagonists are hurled into the sea and ultimately climb onto the monster itself, which they are startled to find is a futuristic submarine. They wait on the deck of the vessel until morning, when they're captured, hauled inside, and introduced to the submarine's mysterious manufacturer and commander, [[Captain Nemo]].\n\nThe rest of the novel describes the protagonists' adventures aboard the  ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'', which was built in secrecy and now roams the seas beyond the reach of land-based governments. In self-imposed exile, Captain Nemo seems to have a dual motivation: a quest for scientific knowledge and a desire to take revenge on terrestrial [[civilization]]. Nemo explains that his submarine is [[electric power|electrically powered]] and can conduct advanced marine research; he also tells his new passengers that his secret existence means he can't let them leave \u2014 they must remain on board permanently. Professor Aronnax and Conseil are enthralled by the prospect of undersea exploration, but Ned Land increasingly hungers to escape.\n\nThey visit many ocean regions, some factual and others fictitious. The travelers view [[coral]] formations, sunken vessels from the [[battle of Vigo Bay]], the [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] ice barrier, the [[Transatlantic telegraph cable]], and the legendary underwater realm of [[Atlantis]]. The passengers also dress themselves in [[diving suit]]s, hunt [[shark]]s and other marine fauna with air guns amid the underwater forests of Crespo Island, and also attend an undersea funeral for a crew member who died during a mysterious collision experienced by the ''Nautilus''. When the submarine returns to the [[Atlantic Ocean]], a school of \"poulpes\" attacks the vessel and kills a crewman. (In French \"poulpe\" is a generic term for a cephalopod, such as a [[cuttlefish]], [[octopus]], etc. \u2014 the noun \"devilfish\" is a close English equivalent. Verne's text specifies that the monster in this case is \"un calmar de dimensions colossales\", \"a squid of colossal dimensions\", that is, a [[giant squid]].) \n\nLate in the novel it's suggested that Captain Nemo went into undersea exile after his homeland was conquered and his family slaughtered by a powerful imperialist nation. Following the episode of the devilfish, Nemo largely avoids Aronnax, who begins to side with Ned Land. In the book's final pages, the ''Nautilus'' is  attacked by a warship from the mysterious nation that has caused Nemo such suffering. Carrying out his quest for revenge, Nemo \u2014 dubbed an \"archangel of hatred\" by Aronnax \u2014 rams the ship below her waterline, and sends her to the bottom, much to Aronnax's horror. Afterwards, Nemo kneels before a picture of his deceased wife and children, then sinks into a deep depression. \n\nCircumstances aboard the submarine change drastically: watches are no longer kept, and the vessel wanders about aimlessly. Ned  becomes so reclusive that Conseil fears for the harpooner's life. One morning, however,  Ned announces that they're in sight of land and have a chance to escape. Professor Aronnax is more than ready to leave Captain Nemo, who now fills him with horror. Yet he's still drawn to the man, and, fearing that Nemo's very presence could weaken his resolve, Aronnax avoids contact with the captain. Before their departure, however, the professor eavesdrops on Nemo and overhears him crying out in anguish, \"O almighty God! Enough! Enough!\" Aronnax immediately joins his companions, and they carry out their escape plans. But as they board the submarine's skiff, they realize that the ''Nautilus'' has seemingly blundered into the ocean's deadliest whirlpool, the [[Moskenstraumen]], more commonly known as the \"Maelstrom\". Nonetheless they manage to escape and find refuge on an island off the coast of Norway. The submarine's ultimate fate, however, remains unknown.\n\n==Themes and subtext==\n[[File:20000 map 1.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Pacific]]\n[[File:20000 map 2.jpg|thumb|''Nautilus''{{'}}s route through the Atlantic]]\nCaptain Nemo's assumed name recalls Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]'', a Greek [[Epic poetry|epic poem]]. In ''The Odyssey'', Odysseus meets the monstrous [[Cyclopes|Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]] during the course of his wanderings. Polyphemus asks Odysseus his name, and Odysseus replies that his name is \"Utis\" (\u03bf\u03c5\u03c4\u03b9\u03c2), which translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". In the [[Latin]] translation of the ''Odyssey'', this [[pseudonym]] is rendered as \"''Nemo''\", which also translates as \"No man\" or \"No one\". Like Captain Nemo, Odysseus wanders the seas in exile (though only for 10 years) and likewise grieves the tragic deaths of his crewmen.\n\nVerne's text repeatedly mentions U.S. Naval Commander [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], an actual oceanographer who investigated the winds, seas, and currents, collected samples from the  depths, and charted the world's oceans. Maury was internationally famous, and Verne may have known of his French ancestry.\n\nThe novel alludes to other Frenchmen, such as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de Lap\u00e9rouse]], a celebrated explorer whose two sloops of war vanished during a voyage of global circumnavigation; [[Dumont d'Urville]], a later explorer who found remnants of one of Lap\u00e9rouse's ships; and [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]], builder of the [[Suez Canal]] and a nephew of the sole survivor of Lap\u00e9rouse's ill-fated expedition. The ''Nautilus'' follows in the footsteps of these men: she visits the waters where Lap\u00e9rouse's vessels disappeared; she enters Torres Strait and becomes stranded there, as did d'Urville's ship, the ''Astrolabe''; and she passes beneath the Suez Canal via a fictitious underwater tunnel joining the Red Sea to the Mediterranean.\n\nIn one of the novel's most famous episodes, the above-cited battle with a school of [[giant squid]], one of the monsters captures a crew member. Reflecting on the battle in the next chapter, Aronnax writes: \"To convey such sights, it would take the pen of our most renowned poet, Victor Hugo, author of ''The Toilers of the Sea''.\" A bestselling novel in Verne's day, ''[[The Toilers of the Sea]]'' also features a threatening cephalopod: a worker battles with an octopus, believed by  critics to be symbolic of the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Certainly Verne was influenced by Hugo's novel, and, in penning this variation on its octopus encounter, he may have intended the symbol to also take in the [[Revolutions of 1848]].\n\nOther symbols and themes pique modern critics. [[Margaret Drabble]], for instance, argues that Verne's  masterwork also anticipated the [[ecology movement]] and influenced French [[avant-garde]] imagery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/04/submarine-dreams |title=Submarine dreams: Jules Verne's ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' |work=New Statesman |author=[[Margaret Drabble]] |date=8 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-05-09}}</ref> \n\nAs for additional motifs in the novel, Captain Nemo repeatedly champions the world's persecuted and downtrodden. While in Mediterranean waters, the captain supplies financial support to rebels resisting Ottoman rule during the [[Cretan Revolt (1866\u20131869)|Cretan Revolt of 1866\u20131869]], proving to Professor Aronnax that he hadn't severed all relations with terrestrial mankind. In another episode, Nemo rescues an East Indian [[pearl diver]] from a shark attack, then gives the fellow a pouch full of pearls, more than the man could have gathered after years of his hazardous work. Nemo remarks later that the diver, as a native of British Colonial India, \"lives in the land of the oppressed\".\n\nIndeed, the novel has an under-the-counter political vision, hinted at in the character and background of Captain Nemo himself. In the novel's initial drafts, the mysterious captain was a [[Szlachta|Polish nobleman]], whose family and homeland were slaughtered by Russian forces during the Polish [[January Uprising]] of 1863. However, these specifics were suppressed during the editing stages at the behest of Verne's publisher, [[Pierre-Jules Hetzel]], believed responsible by today's scholars for many modifications of Verne's original manuscripts. At the time France was a putative ally of the [[Russian Empire]], hence Hetzel insisted on Verne's suppressing the identity of Nemo's enemy, not only to avoid political complications but also to avert lower sales should the novel appear in Russian translation. Hetzel was a thoroughly commercial publisher ... hence Professor Aronnax never discovers Nemo's origins. \n\nEven so, there's still a trace of the novel's original concept, a detail that may have eluded Hetzel: its allusion to an unsuccessful rebellion engineered by an earlier Polish hero \u2014 [[Tadeusz Ko\u015bciuszko]], leader of the [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising|uprising against Russia in 1794]], a Polish national hero who mourned his country's prior defeat with the Latin exclamation \"Finis Poloniae!\" (\"[[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] is no more!\").\n\nFive years later, and at Hetzel's urging, Captain Nemo was revived and revamped for another Verne novel ''[[The Mysterious Island]]''. It revises the captain's nationality from Polish to East Indian, changing him into a fictional descendant of [[Tipu Sultan]], Muslim ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] who resisted the expansionism of the British [[East India Company]]. Nemo's unnamed enemy is thus converted into France's old antagonist, the [[British Empire]]. Born as an Indian aristocrat, one  Prince Dakkar, Nemo participated in a major 19th century uprising, the [[Indian Rebellion]] of 1857, ultimately quashed by the United Kingdom. After his family members were slain by the British, Nemo fled underseas, then made a final reappearance in the later novel's concluding pages. \n\n[[Image:LePlongeurModel(Side).jpg|thumb|Model of the 1863 [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the [[Mus\u00e9e de la Marine]], [[Paris]].]]\n[[File:Nautilus Neuville.JPG|thumb|The ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]]'' as imagined by [[Jules Verne]].]]\nVerne took the name \"Nautilus\" from one of the [[Nautilus (1800 submarine)|earliest successful submarines]], built in 1800 by [[Robert Fulton]], who also invented the first commercially successful [[steamboat]]. Fulton named his submarine after a marine mollusk, the chambered [[nautilus]]. Three years before completing his book, Jules Verne also studied a model of the newly developed [[French Navy]] submarine ''[[French submarine Plongeur|Plongeur]]'' at the 1867 [[Exposition Universelle (1867)|Exposition Universelle]], which inspired him in his development of the novel's ''Nautilus''.<ref>Notice at the Mus\u00e9e de la Marine, [[Rochefort (Charente-Maritime)|Rochefort]]</ref>\n\nThe breathing apparatus used by divers on the ''Nautilus'' is presented as a combination of two existing systems: 1) the [[Surface supplied diving|surface supplied]]<ref name=davis1955/> hardhat suit, which was fed oxygen from the shore through tubes; 2) a later, self-contained apparatus [[Timeline of diving technology#The first diving regulators|designed by Benoit Rouquayrol and Auguste Denayrouze in 1865]].<!-- image of the Rouquayrol and Denayrouze breathing apparatus: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dykeri,_fig_6,_Nordisk_familjebok.png --> Their gear featured tanks fastened to the back, which supplied air to a facial mask via the first-known demand [[Diving regulator|regulator]].<ref name=davis1955>{{cite book |author=Davis, RH |title=Deep Diving and Submarine Operations |year=1955 |edition=6th |publisher=[[Siebe Gorman|Siebe Gorman & Company Ltd]] |location=Tolworth, Surbiton, Surrey |page=693 |authorlink=Robert Davis (inventor) }}</ref>{{r|thomas196112}}<ref name=dive_hx>{{cite journal |last=Acott |first=C. |title=A brief history of diving and decompression illness. |journal=South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society Journal |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=1999 |issn=0813-1988 |oclc=16986801 |url=http://archive.rubicon-foundation.org/6004 |accessdate=2009-03-17 }}</ref> The diver didn't swim but still walked on the seafloor. This device was called an ''a\u00e9rophore'' (Greek for \"air-carrier\"). Its air tanks could hold only 30 atmospheres, however Nemo claims that his futuristic adaptation could do far better: \"The ''Nautilus'''s pumps allow me to store air under considerable pressure ... my diving equipment can supply breathable air for nine or ten hours.\"\n\n==Recurring themes in later books==\nAs noted above, Hetzel and Verne generated a sequel of sorts to this novel: ''L'\u00cele myst\u00e9rieuse'' (''[[The Mysterious Island]]'', 1874), which attempts to round off narratives begun in ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'' and ''Captain Grant's Children'', aka ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]''. While ''The Mysterious Island'' attempts to provide additional background on Nemo (or Prince Dakkar), it's muddled by irreconcilable chronological discrepancies between the two books and even within ''[[The Mysterious Island]]'' itself.\n\nVerne returned to the theme of an outlaw submarine captain in his much later ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' (1896). This novel's chief villain, Ker Karraje, is a simply an unscrupulous pirate acting purely for personal gain, completely devoid of the saving graces that gave Captain Nemo some nobility of character. Like Nemo, Ker Karraje plays \"host\" to unwilling French guests \u2014 but unlike Nemo, who manages to elude all pursuers \u2014 Karraje's criminal career is decisively thwarted by the combination of an international task force and the resistance of his French captives. Though also widely published and translated, ''[[Facing the Flag]]'' never achieved the lasting popularity of ''Twenty Thousand Leagues''.\n\nCloser in approach to the original Nemo \u2014 though offering less detail and complexity of characterization \u2014 is the rebel aeronaut Robur in ''[[Robur the Conqueror]]'' and its sequel ''[[Master of the World (novel)|Master of the World]]''. Instead of the sea, Robur's medium is the sky: in these two novels he develops a pioneering helicopter and later a seaplane on wheels.\n\n==English translations==\nThe novel was first translated into English in 1873 by Reverend [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. Mercier cut nearly a quarter of Verne's French text and committed hundreds of translating errors, sometimes drastically distorting  Verne's original (including uniformly mistranslating the French ''scaphandre'' \u2014 properly \"diving suit\" \u2014 as \"cork-jacket\", following a long-obsolete usage as \"a type of [[lifejacket]]\"). Some of these distortions may been perpetrated for political reasons, such as Mercier's deleting the portraits of freedom fighters on the wall of Nemo's stateroom, a collection originally including [[Daniel O'Connell]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/sherwood/How_Lewis_Mercier.htm |title=How Lewis Mercier and Eleanor King brought you Jules Verne |publisher=Ibiblio.org |accessdate=2013-11-15}}</ref> among other international figures. Nevertheless Mercier's text became the standard English translation, while other \"re-translations\" continued to reproduce its mistakes (including its mistranslation of the novel's title, which, in French, actually means ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas'').\n\nA modern revision of Mercier's translation appeared in 1966, prepared by  Walter James Miller and published by Washington Square Press.<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans). ''Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea'', [[Washington Square Press]], 1966. Standard book number 671-46557-0; [[Library of Congress]] Catalog Card Number 65-25245.</ref> Miller addressed many of Mercier's errors in the volume's preface and restored a number of his deletions in the text proper.\n\nA few years prior, in 1962, Anthony Bonner had published an essentially complete translation of the novel for [[Bantam Classics]]. A specially written introduction by [[Ray Bradbury]], compared Captain Nemo to [[Captain Ahab]] of ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.\n\nMercier's errors were again corrected in a fresh re-examination of the sources and a new translation by Walter James Miller and Frederick Paul Walter, published in 1993 by [[Naval Institute Press]] in a \"completely restored and annotated edition\".<ref>Jules Verne (author), Walter James Miller (trans), Frederick Paul Walter (trans). ''Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea: A Completely Restored and Annotated Edition'', [[Naval Institute Press]], 1993. {{ISBN|1-55750-877-1}}</ref> Its text tapped into Walter's own unpublished translating work, which Project Gutenberg later made available online for readers only.\n\nIn 2010 Frederick Paul Walter issued a fully revised, newly researched translation, ''20,000 Leagues Under the Seas: A World Tour Underwater''. Complete with an introduction and extensive textual notes, it appeared in an omnibus of five of Walter's Verne translations entitled ''Amazing Journeys: Five Visionary Classics'' and published by [[State University of New York Press]].\n\nIn 1998 William Butcher issued a new, annotated translation from the French original, published by [[Oxford University Press]], {{ISBN|0-19-953927-8}}, with the title ''Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Seas''. Butcher includes detailed notes, an extensive bibliography, appendices and a wide-ranging introduction studying the novel from a literary perspective. In particular, his original research on the two manuscripts studies the radical changes to the plot and to the character of Nemo urged on Verne by his original publisher, Pierre-Jules Hetzel.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a notorious 1961 article, [[Theodore L. Thomas]] denounced the novel, alleging that \"there is not a single bit of valid speculation\" in the book and that \"none of its predictions has come true\". He described its depictions of Nemo's diving gear, underwater activities, and the ''Nautilus'' as \"pretty bad, behind the times even for 1869 ... In none of these technical situations did Verne take advantage of knowledge readily available to him at the time.\" Even so, Thomas admitted that despite poor science, plot, and characterization, \"Put them all together with the magic of Verne's  story-telling ability, and something flames up. A story emerges that sweeps incredulity before it\".<ref name=\"thomas196112\">{{Cite magazine\n |last=Thomas\n |first=Theodore L.\n |author=\n |last2=\n |first2=\n |date=December 1961\n |title=The Watery Wonders of Captain Nemo\n |department=\n |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v20n02_1961-12_modified#page/n54/mode/1up \n |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction\n |pages=168\u2013177\n |type=\n}}</ref>\n\nToday, however, Thomas's observations are held in low regard, having been comprehensively debunked in the 1993 Naval Institute Press edition cited above. Thomas had made the fundamental blunder of accepting the original translation's errors and deletions without referencing Verne's French. As the Naval Institute translation documents, every detail denounced by Thomas was actually perpetrated by Verne's first English translator, [[Lewis Page Mercier]]. \n \n==Adaptations and variations==\n{{main|Adaptations of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea}}\n{{Expand section|date=May 2015}}\n\nCaptain Nemo's nationality is presented in many [[feature film]] and video realizations as European. However, he's depicted as East Indian by [[Omar Sharif]] in the 1973 European [[miniseries]] ''[[La Isla misteriosa y el capit\u00e1n Nemo|The Mysterious Island]]''. Nemo also appears as an East Indian in the 1916 silent film version of the novel (which adds elements from ''The Mysterious Island'') and later in both the graphic novel and the film ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. In [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), a live-action Technicolor film of the novel, Captain Nemo seems European, albeit dark-complected. In the Disney adaptation, he's played by British actor [[James Mason]], with \u2014 as in the novel itself \u2014 no mention of his being East Indian. The film's script elaborates on background hints in Verne's original: in an effort to get at Nemo's scientific secrets, his wife and son were tortured to death by an unnamed government overseeing the fictional prison camp of Rorapandi. This is the captain's motivation for sinking warships in the film.

The lanterns are made by members of the audience over the duration of the festival.\n\nIn a tradition dating to 1990, many men wear dresses on the last night of the festival. This began as a hen party for a Towersey regular, where the bride agreed that, due to the lack of female friends attending, men could attend if they dressed appropriately. The following year, the bride and groom held a Sunday afternoon [[cocktail party]], before the Sunday evening session in the Barn, with guests asked to wear their wedding outfits. In time, this evolved into 'Dress Up Sunday'. The bride still attends the festival regularly as a steward.\n\n==Towersey releases==\n\nThe festival has released three compilation albums to date.

This began as a hen party for a Towersey regular, where the bride agreed that, due to the lack of female friends attending, men could attend if they dressed appropriately. The following year, the bride and groom held a Sunday afternoon [[cocktail party]], before the Sunday evening session in the Barn, with guests asked to wear their wedding outfits. In time, this evolved into 'Dress Up Sunday'. The bride still attends the festival regularly as a steward.\n\n==Towersey Releases==\n\nThe festival has released three compilation albums to date.

{"title_page": "Bildwissenschaft", "text_new": "{{italictitle}}\n'''''Bildwissenschaft''''' is an academic discipline in the [[German-speaking world]]. Similar to [[visual studies]], and defined in relation to [[art history]], ''Bildwissenschaft'' (approximately, \"image-science\") refers to a number of different approaches to images, their interpretation and their social significance. Originating in the early 20th century, the field has become more prominent since the 1990s. In the contemporary period, significant theorists and practitioners of ''Bildwissenschaft'' have included {{ill|Klaus Sachs-Hombach|de}}, [[Gottfried Boehm]], [[Hans Belting]], [[Horst Bredekamp]] and {{ill|Lambert Wiesing|de}}, each of whom have developed distinct orientations toward their subject matter.\n\n==Etymology==\n''[[Wissenschaft]]'' (from ''Wissen'', meaning \"knowledge\") is similar in meaning to \"science\", but is used differently and with different connotations.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=209}} Whereas \"science\" typically refers specifically to [[empirical]] investigations in the [[natural sciences]] and [[social sciences]], ''Wissenschaft'' does not carry the same methodological implications.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=209}} Nevertheless, ''Wissenschaft'' is more restrictive than the English \"studies\", as it indicates the systematic ordering of knowledge, that attention be paid to questions of method, and that a discipline aspire to a comprehensive treatment of its subject.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=209}}\n\nSimilarly, ''[[wikt:Bild#German|Bild]]'' is close in meaning to \"image\", but refers to pictures of all kinds, both representational and abstract, including paintings, drawings, photographs, computer-generated images, film and sculpture; illustrations, figures, maps and diagrams; and [[mental image]]s and metaphors.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=209}}\n\n==Overview==\n''Bildwissenschaft'' expands the parameters of [[art history]] to encompass, and to take seriously, images of all kinds.{{sfn|Bredekamp|2003|p=418}} The polysemic character of the term ''Bild'' has been embraced by proponents of ''Bildwissenschaft'' as a means of encouraging [[interdisciplinarity]] and collaboration.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=209}} This characteristic also facilitates the avoidance of any distinction between [[high culture]] and [[low culture]].{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|pp=209\u201310}} Accordingly, ''Bildwissenschaft'' incorporates not only the study of \"low culture\" images but also of scientific, architectural and cartographic images and diagrams.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=210}}\n\n''Bildwissenschaft'' occupies a more central role in the [[liberal arts]] and [[humanities]] in German-speaking nations than that afforded to art history or [[visual studies]] in the United States and United Kingdom.{{sfn|Craven|2014|p=140}} The tendency in the English-speaking world to see art history and visual studies as entirely distinct disciplines has carried over into the German and Austrian context to an extent, and efforts to define ''Bildwissenschaft'' in opposition to art history have been pursued.{{sfn|Bredekamp|2003|p=419}}\n\nSignificant differences between ''Bildwissenschaft'' and Anglophone cultural and visual studies include the former's examination of images dating from the [[early modern period]], and its emphasis on continuities over breaks with the past.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=212}} Whereas Anglo-American visual studies can be seen as a continuation of [[critical theory]] in its attempt to reveal power relations, ''Bildwissenschaft'' is not explicitly political.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=213}}\n\n[[Charlotte Klonk]] has argued that ''Bildwissenschaft'' is [[ontological]] rather than historical, concerned with fundamental questions \"of what images are able to achieve in general and what distinguishes them from other vehicles of knowledge.\"{{sfn|Craven|2014|p=143\u20134}} Matthew Rampley describes ''Bildwissenschaft'' as \"a heterogeneous and disunified field that encompasses widely divergent and often competing interests and approaches.\"{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=121}}\n\n==History==\nThe major elements of ''Bildwissenschaft'' were developed in Germany and Austria in the period from 1900 to 1933.{{sfn|Bredekamp|2003|p=418}} Art historians including [[Herman Grimm]], [[Wilhelm L\u00fcbke]], [[Anton Heinrich Springer]], [[Jacob Burckhardt]], [[Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin]] and [[Erwin Panofsky]], all of whom saw value in photographs and [[slide show|slides]], contributed to the development of ''Bildwissenschaft''.{{sfn|Bredekamp|2003|p=422}} After 1970 it saw a revival and began to incorporate the study of advertising, photography, film and video, [[political symbolism]], [[digital art]] and [[Internet art]].{{sfn|Bredekamp|2003|p=418}} The development of ''Bildwissenschaft'' to an extent paralleled that of the field of visual culture in the United Kingdom and United States.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=121}} Rampley suggests that while the discipline's development can be situated as part of a wider process in Anglophone scholarship, as well as in France, Spain and Italy, such an account is accurate \"only in the most general sense of a shift away from art history as the master discourse governing interpretation and analysis of the image.\"{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=133}}\n\n''Bildwissenschaft'' subsequently influenced the [[structuralism]] of [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] and the [[habitus theory]] of [[Pierre Bourdieu]], as well as developments in art history.{{sfn|Bredekamp|2003|p=428}}\n\nKlonk argues that the re-emergence of ''Bildwissenschaft'' within art history after 1998 was the result of, first, the contention that the circulation of images in [[mass media]] had the effect of reconfiguring previously text-based societies as image-based societies; second, that the methodologies of the discipline of art history were well-suited to apprehending this new conjuncture; and, third, that art history's focus would of necessity expand to encompass (for example) scientific imagery, advertisements and popular culture.{{sfn|Craven|2014|p=142}} Work in ''Bildwissenschaft'' in the 2000s and 2010s has tended to argue that linguistic theories of meaning and interpretation cannot be applied to the visual realm, which has ''[[sui generis]]'' characteristics, and that prevalent approaches to art history unjustifiably prioritise the linguistic over the visual.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=212}}\n\n[[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Aby Warburg]], [[Carl Justi]], [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]] have been identified as precursors of modern ''Bildwissenschaft''.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=121}}\n\nIn 2012, Rampley wrote that ''Bildwissenschaft'' \"is increasingly gaining currency as the denominator of a new set of theoretical discourses\" in the German-speaking world, and had been the subject of several books offering introductions to the field, but emphasised that this was not indicative of \"a single unified field\".{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=134}}\n\n==Theorists and practitioners==\n===Klaus Sachs-Hombach===\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, {{ill|Klaus Sachs-Hombach|de}} used the concept in his discussion of the [[semantics]] and psychology of images, and the possibility in [[semiotics]] of an analogy between images and texts, an analogy he called into question.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|pp=121\u20132}} Sachs-Hombach's conception of ''Bildwissenschaft'' frames the concept in terms of theoretical issues of cognition and models of interpretation.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=123}} His edited volume ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'' (2005) draws together work by experts across 28 disciplines (including art history) to argue for the possibility of a universal and interdisciplinary ''Bildwissenschaft'' that would function not as a wholly new discipline, but rather as a \"common theoretical framework that could provide an integrative research programme for the various disciplines\".{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=210}} Understood in this way, Sachs-Hombach argued that ''Bildwissenschaft'' should integrate and systematise insights from these various bodies of knowledge, analyse and define a set of common basic concepts, and develop strategies for interdisciplinary co-operation.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=210\u201311}} Jason Gaiger has argued that Sachs-Hombach's work is the best representation \"of ''Bildwissenschaft'' as an interdisciplinary research project\".{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=210}}\n\n===Gottfried Boehm===\n[[Gottfried Boehm]]'s account of the concept drew on [[aesthetics]] and the work of [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Hans Jonas]], [[Arthur Danto]], [[Meyer Schapiro]], [[Kurt Bauch]] and [[Max Imdahl]].{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=123}} Boehm addressed questions around the [[phenomenology]] of viewing and pictorial representation and the question of medium.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=123}} He also sought to understand the cognitive processes involved in the presentation and perception of images, and their differences from linguistic processes.{{sfn|Craven|2014|p=143}}\n\n===Hans Belting===\n[[Hans Belting]], in 2001, offered another account, which sought to develop an anthropological theory of the image in order to examines its universal functions that span cultural distinctions, and considered the relationship between the image and the body.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=126}}{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|pp=211\u201312}} Belting examined images used in religious contexts in order to identify the original non-artistic functions of images today considered [[art object]]s, and argued that \"art\" was a unit of analysis had emerged in the 16th century that obstructed corporeal engagements with images.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|pp=126\u20137}} In ''Likeness and Presence'' (1990), Belting argued for the necessity of understanding the ways images give meaning to their contexts, rather than gaining meaning from their contexts, in order to understand images as actors with their own agency.{{sfn|Craven|2014|p=143}} Belting argues that art history as a disciplinary formation is outmoded and potentially obsolete,{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=214}} and that a universal ''Bildwissenschaft'', the exact scope and methods of which remain uncertain, should be sought.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=211}}\n\n===Horst Bredekamp===\n[[Horst Bredekamp]]'s 21st-century work considered the cognitive functions performed by the image, the question of a stylistic history of scientific imagery, and the role played by visual argumentation during the [[Scientific Revolution]].{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=130}} Focusing primarily on images that fall outside of art proper, such as those used in the works of the philosophers [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and the scientists [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], Bredekamp argues that images inculcate a particular kind of understanding that could not be formed in their absence.{{sfn|Craven|2014|p=144}} Bredekamp criticises the idea, associated with Sachs-Hombach, that ''Bildwissenschaft'' might be constructed by amassing the pre-existing insights of various disciplines, arguing that a new science cannot be straightforwardly established through the adding together of existing disciplines.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=211}} Against Sachs-Hombach's argument that art history is one of many disciplines on which ''Bildwissenschaft'' should draw, and Belting's argument that art history is outdated or obsolescent, Bredekamp argues that (Austro-German) art history has always contained an incipiently universal orientation and a focus on non-art images.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=214}}\n\n===Lambert Wiesing===\nThe philosopher {{ill|Lambert Wiesing|de}} shares with Bredekamp the belief that ''Bildwissenschaft''{{'}}s universalism is inherent in art history, but argues that ''Bildwissenschaft'' differentiates itself by virtue of its attention to images ''per se'' rather than specific images or groups of images.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|pp=215\u201316}} Wiesing distinguishes between ''Bildwissenschaft'' and ''{{ill|Bildtheorie|de|Bildwissenschaft#Bildwissenschaft und Bildtheorie}}'' (\"image theory\"), arguing that, while the two are complementary, the former is concerned with specific, concrete images, whereas the latter seeks answers to the question of what an image is.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=217}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite

[[visual studies]] in the United States and United Kingdom.{{sfn|Craven|2014|p=140}} The tendency in the English-speaking world to see art history and visual studies as entirely distinct disciplines has carried over into the German and Austrian context to an extent, and efforts to define ''Bildwissenschaft'' in opposition to art history have been pursued.{{sfn|Bredekamp|2003|p=419}}\n\nSignificant differences between ''Bildwissenschaft'' and Anglophone cultural and visual studies include the former's examination of images dating from the [[early modern period]], and its emphasis on continuities over breaks with the past.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=212}} Whereas Anglo-American visual studies can be seen as a continuation of [[critical theory]] in its attempt to reveal power relations, ''Bildwissenschaft'' is not explicitly political.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=213}}\n\n[[Charlotte Klonk]] has argued that ''Bildwissenschaft'' is [[ontological]] rather than historical, concerned with fundamental questions \"of what images are able to achieve in general and what distinguishes them from other vehicles of knowledge.\"{{sfn|Craven|2014|p=143\u20134}} Matthew Rampley describes ''Bildwissenschaft'' as \"a heterogeneous and disunified field that encompasses widely divergent and often competing interests and approaches.\"{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=121}}\n\n==History==\nThe major elements of ''Bildwissenschaft'' were developed in Germany and Austria in the period from 1900 to 1933.{{sfn|Bredekamp|2003|p=418}} Art historians including [[Herman Grimm]], [[Wilhelm L\u00fcbke]], [[Anton Heinrich Springer]], [[Jacob Burckhardt]], [[Heinrich W\u00f6lfflin]] and [[Erwin Panofsky]], all of whom saw value in photographs and [[slide show|slides]], contributed to the development of ''Bildwissenschaft''.{{sfn|Bredekamp|2003|p=422}} After 1970 it saw a revival and began to incorporate the study of advertising, photography, film and video, [[political symbolism]], [[digital art]] and [[Internet art]].{{sfn|Bredekamp|2003|p=418}} The development of ''Bildwissenschaft'' to an extent paralleled that of the field of visual culture in the United Kingdom and United States.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=121}} Rampley suggests that while the discipline's development can be situated as part of a wider process in Anglophone scholarship, as well as in France, Spain and Italy, such an account is accurate \"only in the most general sense of a shift away from art history as the master discourse governing interpretation and analysis of the image.\"{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=133}}\n\n''Bildwissenschaft'' subsequently influenced the [[structuralism]] of [[Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss]] and the [[habitus theory]] of [[Pierre Bourdieu]], as well as developments in art history.{{sfn|Bredekamp|2003|p=428}}\n\nKlonk argues that the re-emergence of ''Bildwissenschaft'' within art history after 1998 was the result of, first, the contention that the circulation of images in [[mass media]] had the effect of reconfiguring previously text-based societies as image-based societies; second, that the methodologies of the discipline of art history were well-suited to apprehending this new conjuncture; and, third, that art history's focus would of necessity expand to encompass (for example) scientific imagery, advertisements and popular culture.{{sfn|Craven|2014|p=142}} Work in ''Bildwissenschaft'' in the 2000s and 2010s has tended to argue that linguistic theories of meaning and interpretation cannot be applied to the visual realm, which has ''[[sui generis]]'' characteristics, and that prevalent approaches to art history unjustifiably prioritise the linguistic over the visual.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=212}}\n\n[[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Aby Warburg]], [[Carl Justi]], [[Carl Schmitt]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]] have been identified as precursors of modern ''Bildwissenschaft''.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=121}}\n\nIn 2012, Rampley wrote that ''Bildwissenschaft'' \"is increasingly gaining currency as the denominator of a new set of theoretical discourses\" in the German-speaking world, and had been the subject of several books offering introductions to the field, but emphasised that this was not indicative of \"a single unified field\".{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=134}}\n\n==Theorists and practitioners==\n===Klaus Sachs-Hombach===\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, {{ill|Klaus Sachs-Hombach|de}} used the concept in his discussion of the [[semantics]] and psychology of images, and the possibility in [[semiotics]] of an analogy between images and texts, an analogy he called into question.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|pp=121\u20132}} Sachs-Hombach's conception of ''Bildwissenschaft'' frames the concept in terms of theoretical issues of cognition and models of interpretation.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=123}} His edited volume ''Bildwissenschaft: Disziplinen, Themen, Methoden'' (2005) draws together work by experts across 28 disciplines (including art history) to argue for the possibility of a universal and interdisciplinary ''Bildwissenschaft'' that would function not as a wholly new discipline, but rather as a \"common theoretical framework that could provide an integrative research programme for the various disciplines\".{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=210}} Understood in this way, Sachs-Hombach argued that ''Bildwissenschaft'' should integrate and systematise insights from these various bodies of knowledge, analyse and define a set of common basic concepts, and develop strategies for interdisciplinary co-operation.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=210\u201311}} Jason Gaiger has argued that Sachs-Hombach's work is the best representation \"of ''Bildwissenschaft'' as an interdisciplinary research project\".{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=210}}\n\n===Gottfried Boehm===\n[[Gottfried Boehm]]'s account of the concept drew on [[aesthetics]] and the work of [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]], [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]], [[Hans Jonas]], [[Arthur Danto]], [[Meyer Schapiro]], [[Kurt Bauch]] and [[Max Imdahl]].{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=123}} Boehm addressed questions around the [[phenomenology]] of viewing and pictorial representation and the question of medium.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=123}} He also sought to understand the cognitive processes involved in the presentation and perception of images, and their differences from linguistic processes.{{sfn|Craven|2014|p=143}}\n\n===Hans Belting===\n[[Hans Belting]], in 2001, offered another account, which sought to develop an anthropological theory of the image in order to examines its universal functions that span cultural distinctions, and considered the relationship between the image and the body.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=126}}{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|pp=211\u201312}} Belting examined images used in religious contexts in order to identify the original non-artistic functions of images today considered [[art object]]s, and argued that \"art\" was a unit of analysis had emerged in the 16th century that obstructed corporeal engagements with images.{{sfn|Rampley|2012|pp=126\u20137}} In ''Likeness and Presence'' (1990), Belting argued for the necessity of understanding the ways images give meaning to their contexts, rather than gaining meaning from their contexts, in order to understand images as actors with their own agency.{{sfn|Craven|2014|p=143}} Belting argues that art history as a disciplinary formation is outmoded and potentially obsolete,{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=214}} and that a universal ''Bildwissenschaft'', the exact scope and methods of which remain uncertain, should be sought.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=211}}\n\n===Horst Bredekamp===\n[[Horst Bredekamp]]'s 21st-century work considered the cognitive functions performed by the image, the question of a stylistic history of scientific imagery, and the role played by visual argumentation during the [[Scientific Revolution]].{{sfn|Rampley|2012|p=130}} Focusing primarily on images that fall outside of art proper, such as those used in the works of the philosophers [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] and the scientists [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Galileo Galilei]], Bredekamp argues that images inculcate a particular kind of understanding that could not be formed in their absence.{{sfn|Craven|2014|p=144}} Bredekamp criticises the idea, associated with Sachs-Hombach, that ''Bildwissenschaft'' might be constructed by amassing the pre-existing insights of various disciplines, arguing that a new science cannot be straightforwardly established through the adding together of existing disciplines.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=211}} Against Sachs-Hombach's argument that art history is one of many disciplines on which ''Bildwissenschaft'' should draw, and Belting's argument that art history is outdated or obsolescent, Bredekamp argues that (Austro-German) art history has always contained an incipiently universal orientation and a focus on non-art images.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=214}}\n\n===Lambert Wiesing===\nThe philosopher {{ill|Lambert Wiesing|de}} shares with Bredekamp the belief that ''Bildwissenschaft''{{'}}s universalism is inherent in art history, but argues that ''Bildwissenschaft'' differentiates itself by virtue of its attention to images ''per se'' rather than specific images or groups of images.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|pp=215\u201316}} Wiesing distinguishes between ''Bildwissenschaft'' and ''{{ill|Bildtheorie|de|Bildwissenschaft#Bildwissenschaft und Bildtheorie}}'' (\"image theory\"), arguing that, while the two are complementary, the former is concerned with specific, concrete images, whereas the latter seeks answers to the question of what an image is.{{sfn|Gaiger|2014|p=217}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite

The vast majority of them died of [[yellow fever]], making the epidemic in the city of 50,000 people one of the most severe in United States history. By the end of September, 20,000 people had fled the city. The mortality rate peaked in October, before frost finally killed the mosquitoes and brought an end to the epidemic in November. Doctors tried a variety of treatments, but knew neither the origin of the fever nor that it was transmitted by mosquitoes (which was not verified until the late nineteenth century).\n\nThe mayor and a committee of two dozen organized a fever hospital at Bush Hill and other crisis measures. The assistance of the [[Free African Society]] was requested by the city and readily agreed to by the members, based on the mistaken assumption that native Africans would have the same partial immunity to the new disease as many had to [[malaria]], the most common source of fever epidemics during the summer months.<ref>From [[Genetic resistance to malaria]]: ''\"Where this parasite [p. falciparum] is endemic, young children have repeated malaria attacks. [...] Repeated malaria infections strengthen adaptive immunity and broaden its effects against parasites expressing different to the good old immunity against malaria.\"''</ref> Black nurses aided the sick and the group's leaders hired additional men to take away corpses, which most people would not touch. Blacks in the city died at the same rate as whites, about 240 altogether.\n\nSome neighboring towns refused to let refugees in from Philadelphia, for fear they were carrying the fever. Major port cities such as Baltimore and New York had quarantines against refugees and goods from Philadelphia although New York sent financial aid to the city.\n\n==Beginnings==\nIn the spring of 1793, French colonial refugees, some with slaves, arrived from [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap Fran\u00e7ais]], [[Saint-Domingue]] (now Haiti). The 2,000 immigrants were fleeing the [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolution]] in the north of the island.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite journal|title=Andrew Brown's \"Earnest Endeavor\": The Federal Gazette's Role in Philadelphia's Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793 |first=Mark A. |last=Smith |journal=[[Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography]] |volume=120 |issue=4 |date=October 1996 |pages=321\u2013342 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |url=https://journals.psu.edu/pmhb/article/view/45107/44828 |via=[[Pennsylvania State University Libraries]]}}</ref> They crowded the port of Philadelphia, where the first yellow fever epidemic in the city in 30 years began in August.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>{{sfn|Rush|1794|p=6}} It is likely that the refugees and ships carried the yellow fever [[virus]] and mosquitoes. The virus is transmitted by mosquito bites. Mosquitoes easily breed in small amounts of standing water. The medical community and others in 1793 did not understand the role of mosquitoes in the transmission of yellow fever and other diseases. \n\nIn the ports and coastal areas of the United States, even in the northeast, the months of August and September were considered the \"sickly season,\" when fevers were prevalent. In the South, planters and other people wealthy enough usually left the Low Country during this season. Natives thought that newcomers especially had to undergo a \"seasoning\" and were more likely to die of what were thought to be seasonal fevers in their early years in the region.<ref>Currie, William, ''An Historical Account of the Climate and Diseases of the United States,'' Philadelphia: T. Dobson, 1792</ref> Philadelphia then was the temporary capital of the United States, and the government was due to return in the fall. President George Washington had left the city.\n\nThe first two people to die of yellow fever in early August in Philadelphia were both recent immigrants, one from [[Ireland]] and the other from Saint-Domingue. Letters describing their cases were published in a pamphlet about a month after they died. The young doctor sent by the Overseers of the Poor to treat the Irish woman was perplexed, and his treatment did not save her.{{sfn|Currie|1793|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nA 2013 book by Billy G. Smith, professor of history at Montana State University, makes a case that the principal vector of the 1793 plague in Philadelphia (and other Atlantic ports) was the British merchant ship ''Hankey'', which had fled the West African colony of [[Bolama]] (an island off West Africa, present day [[Guinea-Bissau]]) the previous November, trailing yellow fever at every port of call in the Caribbean and eastern Atlantic seaboard.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ship of Death: A Voyage That Changed the Atlantic World |last=Smith |first=Billy G. |date=2013 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven & London |url=https://yalebooks.co.uk/display.asp?k=9780300194524 |isbn=978-0-300-19452-4}}</ref>\n\n==Epidemic declared==\nAfter two weeks and an increasing number of fever cases, Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]], a doctor's apprentice during the city's 1762<ref>{{cite book|author=Jim Murphy|title=An Amegoogle.com/books?id=DmWTBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-53285-1|page=31}}</ref> yellow fever epidemic, saw the pattern; he recognized that yellow fever had returned. Rush alerted his colleagues and the government that the city faced an epidemic of \"highly contagious, as well as mortal... bilious remitting yellow fever.\"{{sfn|Rush|1794|p=13}} Adding to the alarm was that, unlike with most fevers, the principal victims were not the very young or very old. Many of the early deaths were teenagers and heads of families in the dockside areas.<ref>Butterfield, L. H., editor, ''Letters of Benjamin Rush,'' vol. 2, p 641.</ref> Believing that the refugees from Saint-Domingue were carrying the disease, the city imposed a quarantine of two to three weeks on immigrants and their goods, but was unable to enforce it as the epidemic increased its reach.<ref name=\"Epidemic\"/>\n\nThen the largest city in the US, with around 50,000 residents, Philadelphia was relatively compact and most houses were within seven blocks of its major port on the Delaware River. Docking facilities extended from Southwark south of the city to Kensington to the north. Cases of fever clustered at first around the Arch Street wharf. Rush blamed \"some damaged coffee which putrefied on the wharf near Arch Street\" for causing the fevers. Soon cases appeared in Kensington.{{sfn|Rush|1794|p=17}} As the port was critical to the state's economy, the Pennsylvania governor, [[Thomas Mifflin]], had responsibility for its health. He asked the port physician, Dr. James Hutchinson, to assess conditions. The doctor found that 67 of about 400 residents near the Arch Street wharf were sick, but only 12 had \"malignant fevers.\"<ref>''American Daily Advertiser,'' August 28, 1793.</ref>  Alarmed by what Rush and others told him, Mayor [[Matthew Clarkson]] asked the city's medical society, the [[College of Physicians of Philadelphia|College of Physicians]], to meet and advise the city's government and citizens how to proceed.\n\nRush later described some early cases: On August 7, he treated a young man for headaches, fever and vomiting, and on the 15th treated his brother. On the same day a woman he was treating turned yellow. On the 18th a man in the third day of a fever had no pulse, was cold, clammy, and yellow, but he could sit up in his bed. He died a few hours later. On the 19th a woman Rush visited died within hours. Another physician said five persons within sight of her door died. None of those victims was a recent immigrant.{{sfn|Rush|1794|pp=9\u201311}}\n\nThe College published a letter in the city's newspapers, written by a committee headed by Rush, suggesting 11 measures to prevent the \"progress\" of the fever. They warned citizens to avoid fatigue, the hot sun, night air, too much liquor, and anything else that might lower their resistance. Vinegar and camphor in infected rooms \"cannot be used too frequently upon handkerchiefs, or in smelling bottles, by persons whose duty calls to visit or attend the sick.\" They outlined measures for city officials: stopping the tolling of church bells and making burials private; cleaning streets and wharves; exploding gunpowder in the street to increase the amount of oxygen. Everyone should avoid unnecessary contact with the sick.{{sfn|Rush|1794|pp=21ff}} Crews were sent to clean the wharves, streets and the market, which cheered those remaining in the city.<ref>''Federal Gazette,'' August 31, 1793.</ref> Many of those who could left the city.\n\nElizabeth Drinker, a married Quaker woman, kept a journal for years; her account from August 23 through August 30 tells the quickening story of the spread of the disease in the city and the rising toll of deaths. She also describes the many people leaving the city.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Drinker | first=Elizabeth |  title= Extracts from the Journal of Elizabeth Drinker, From 1759 to 1807, A.D.| editor= Biddle, Henry D. | location=Philadelphia | publisher= J.B.

The Seat of Wm. Hamilton Esqr. near Philadelphia'', by [[James Peller Malcolm]]. Bush Hill was the country seat of James Hamilton by this time.]]\nThe Guardians of the Poor took over Bush Hill, a 150-acre estate farther outside the city, whose owner William Hamilton was in England for an extended stay. Vice President [[John Adams]] had recently rented the main house, so yellow fever patients were placed in the outbuildings.{{sfn|Carey|1793|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Powell|1993|pp=58\u201362}} Nurses were hired to treat patients, under orders by young physicians from the city, who were to visit on a daily basis.\n\nThe end of August was not traditionally a busy time in the city. Many families who could afford to or who had relatives in the countryside lived elsewhere during that hot month. Beginning in September, shipments generally increased with the arrival of fall goods from Britain. In 1793, the Federal Congress was not scheduled to resume session until November, but the Pennsylvania Assembly met in the first week of September. Founded by the Quaker [[William Penn]], the city was the center of Quaker life in the United States. The Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends was scheduled to be held in the third week of September.\n\n===Panic and refugees===\nBetween the College's advisory on August 25 and the death of Dr. Hutchinson from yellow fever on September 7, panic spread throughout the city; more people fled. Between August 1 and September 7, 456 people died in the city; 42 deaths were reported on September 8.{{sfn|Rush|1794|pp=129ff}} An estimated 20,000 people left the city through September, including national leaders.<ref name=\"Epidemic\">{{cite web|title=Africans in America \u2013 Part 3: Brotherly Love (1791\u20131831) \u2013 Philadelphia/People & Events/The Yellow Fever epidemic |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3p1590.html |date=1998 |work=[[PBS]] |access-date=March 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321120827/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3p1590.html |archive-date=March 21, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> The daily death toll remained above 30 until October 26. The worst seven-day period was between October 7 and 13, when 711 deaths were reported.{{sfn|Rush|1794|pp=129ff}}\n\nSome neighboring towns had patrols on the roads to prevent entry by refugees. The major ports of Baltimore and New York prevented refugees from entering and quarantined them and goods from Philadelphia for weeks.\n\nThe publisher [[Mathew Carey]] published a short pamphlet later in the fall in which he described the changes that had occurred in the life of the city:\n<blockquote>\"Those who ventured abroad, had handkerchiefs or sponges impregnated with vinegar of [[camphor]] at their noses, or smelling-bottles full of the thieves\u2019 vinegar. Others carried pieces of tarred rope in their hands or pockets, or camphor bags tied round their necks.... People hastily shifted their course at the sight of a hearse coming towards them. Many never walked on the footpath, but went into the middle of the streets, to avoid being infected in passing by houses wherein people had died. Acquaintances and friends avoided each other in the streets, and only signified their regard by a cold nod. The old custom of shaking hands fell in such general disuse, that many shrunk back with affright at even the offer of a hand. A person with crape [mourning crepe], or any appearance of mourning, was shunned like a viper.\"{{sfn|Carey|1793|p=22}}</blockquote>\n\n==Black nurses==\nThe College of Physicians' advisory implied the fever was contagious and people should avoid contact with its victims although \"duty\" required that they be cared for. Yet in families, when the person with the fever was a mother or father, they could forbid their children from coming near them. Rush knew of Dr. John Lining's observation during the 1742 yellow fever epidemic in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], that African slaves appeared to be affected at rates lower than whites; he thought they had a natural immunity. Writing a short letter to the newspapers under the pseudonym \"[[Anthony Benezet]],\" a Quaker who had provided schooling for blacks, Rush suggested that the city's people of color had immunity and solicited them \"to offer your services to attend the sick to help those known in distress.\"<ref name=\"Allen\"/><ref>''American Daily Advertiser,'' September 2, 1793.</ref> [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]] and [[Absalom Jones]] recalled their reaction to the letter in a memoir they published shortly after the epidemic:\n\n<blockquote>Early in September, a solicitation appeared in the public papers, to the people of colour to come forward and assist the distressed, perishing, and neglected sick; with a kind of assurance, that people of our colour were not liable to take the infection. Upon which we and a few others met and consulted how to act on so truly alarming and melancholy occasion. After some conversation, we found a freedom to go forth, confiding in Him who can preserve in the midst of a burning fiery furnace, sensible that it was our duty to do all the good we could to our suffering fellow mortals. We set out to see where we could be useful. The first we visited was a man in Emsley's alley, who was dying, and his wife lay dead at the time in the house, there were none to assist but two poor helpless children. We administered what relief we could, and applied to the overseers of the poor to have the woman buried. We visited upwards of twenty families that day\u2014they were scenes of woe indeed! The Lord was plentiful to strengthen us, and removed all fear from us...<ref name=\"Allen\">{{cite web | last=Allen | first=Richard | title=A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People.... | url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/6483355?n=3&printThumbnails=no |accessdate=January 31, 2012 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>In order the better to regulate our conduct, we called on the mayor the next day, to consult with him on how to proceed, so as to be the most useful. The first object he recommended was a strict attention to the sick, and the procuring of nurses. This was attended to by Absalom Jones and William Gray; and, in order that the distressed might know where to apply, the mayor advised that upon application to them they would be supplied. Soon after, the mortality increased, the difficulty of getting a corpse taken away, was such, that few were willing to do it, when offered great rewards. The black people were looked to. We then offered our services in the public papers, by advertising that we would remove the dead and procure nurses. Our services were the production of real sensibility\u2014we sought not fee nor reward, until the increase of the disorder rendered our labour so arduous that we were not adequate to the service we had assumed.<ref name=\"Allen\"/></blockquote>\n\nAllen noted in his account that because of the increase in mortality, he and Jones had to hire five men to assist them in removing corpses, as most people avoided the sick and the dead.<ref name=\"Allen\"/>  In a September 6 letter to his wife, Rush said that the \"African brethren ... furnish nurses to most of my patients.\"<ref>Butterfield, p. 654</ref> Despite Rush's theory, most of the city's people of color were not immune to the fever. Many of the slaves in Charleston in 1742 could have gained immunity before having been transported from Africa, by having been exposed to yellow fever in a mild case. People who survived one attack gained immunity.{{sfn|Allen|Jones|1794|pp=15\u201316}} A total of 240 blacks died, in proportion to their population at the same rate as whites.<ref name=\"Epidemic\"/>\n\n==Controversy over treatment==\nGiven the limited resources and knowledge of the times, the city's response was credible. The medical community did not know the natural history of yellow fever, a viral infection spread by the ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' mosquito. Efforts to clean the city did not defeat the spread of the fever as the mosquitoes bred in the clean water. Philadelphia's newspapers continued to publish during the epidemic, and through the doctors and others tried to understand and combat the epidemic. On September 7, Dr. Adam Kuhn advised patients to treat symptoms as they arose; he had studied medicine at the [[University of Uppsala]] in Sweden.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Marion E. |last=Brown |title=Adam Kuhn: Eighteenth Century Physician and Teacher |journal=[[Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences]] |volume=V |date=March 1, 1950 |issue=Spring 1950 |pages=163\u2013177 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/V.Spring.163|pmid=15412232 }}</ref>\n\nRush claimed that he tried Kuhn's and Steven's stimulating remedies, and his patients still died. He recommended other treatments, including purging and [[bloodletting]], and published his theories. The hope offered by any of these treatments was soon dashed when it became clear that they did not cure the disease, and the doctors' competing claims demoralized patients.<ref name=\"Butterfield, pp 1213-18\">Butterfield, pp 1213\u201318.</ref>\n\nIn his 1794 account of the epidemic, Matthew Carey noted that other doctors claimed to have used [[Mercury(I)_chloride|calomel]] (a [[Mercury_(element)|mercury]] compound) before Rush and that \"its efficacy was great and rescued many from death.\" Carey added that the \"efficacy of bleeding, in all cases not attended with putridity, was great.\"{{sfn|Carey|1793|p=15}} Rush taught the African-American nurses how to bleed and purge patients. Allen and Jones wrote that they were thankful that \"we have been the instruments, in the hand of God, for saving the lives of hundreds of our suffering fellow mortals.\"{{sfn|Allen|Jones|1794|p=5}} Rush's brand of medicine became the standard American treatment for fevers in the 1790s and was widely used for the next 50 years.<ref>Duffy, William, ''From Humors to Medical Science,'' 1993, pp 68\u201371</ref>\n\nRush's claim that his remedies cured 99 out of 100 patients have led historians and modern doctors to ridicule his remedies and approach to medical science. Some contemporaries also attacked him. The newspaper editor [[William Cobbett]] attacked Rush's therapies and called him a ''Sangrado'', after a character in ''[[Gil Blas]]'', who bled patients to death. In 1799 Rush won a $5,000 libel judgment against Cobbett.<ref name=\"Butterfield, pp 1213-18\"/>\n\n==Government responses to crisis==\nThe responses of the various levels of government in the city varied. The Federal government had no authority to act and Congress had not been in session since June. President Washington and his cabinet continued to meet until he left the city on September 10 for his scheduled vacation, a period that included laying the cornerstone on September 18 of the new US Capitol to be built in the City of Washington, the designated capital. Employees of the Treasury Department, who collected customs and worked on the country's financial system, worked throughout the epidemic; the post office also stayed open.\n\nThe state legislature cut short its September session after a dead body was found on the steps of State House. Governor Mifflin became ill and was advised by his doctor to leave. The city's banks remained open. But, banking operations were so slowed by the inability of people to pay off notes because of disruptions from the epidemic that banks automatically renewed notes until the epidemic ended.{{sfn|Carey|1793|p=12}}\n\nThe mayor [[Matthew Clarkson (mayor)|Matthew Clarkson]] organized the city's response to the epidemic. Most of the Common Council members fled, along with 20,000 other residents. People who did not leave Philadelphia before the second week in September could leave the city only with great difficulty, and they faced road blocks, patrols, inspections and quarantines.{{sfn|Powell|1993|pp=216ff}} On September 12, Clarkson summoned fellow citizens interested in helping the Guardians of the Poor. They formed a committee to take over from the Guardians and address the crisis.<ref name=\"Committee\">''Minutes of the Proceedings of the Committee to Attend to and Alleviate the Sufferings of the Afflicted with the Malignant Fever,'' 1794.</ref>\n\nOn the 14th, Clarkson was joined by 26 men, who formed committees to reorganize the fever hospital, arrange visits to the sick, feed those unable to care for themselves, and arrange for wagons to carry the sick to the hospital and the dead to Potter's Field.<ref name=\"Committee\"/> The Committee acted quickly: after a report of 15-month-old twins being orphaned, two days later the Committee had identified a house for sheltering the growing number of orphans.<ref>{{cite web | last=Minutes | title=p. 22 | url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/6395244?n=30&printThumbnails=no |accessdate=January 31, 2012 }}</ref> As noted above, [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]] and [[Absalom Jones]] offered the services of members of the [[Free African Society]] to the Committee.<ref>Allen and Jones, ''A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People...,'' 1993, p. to come.</ref>\n\nWhen the Mayor's Committee inspected the Bush Hill fever hospital, they found the nurses unqualified and arrangements chaotic.<ref>{{cite web | last=Minutes | title=p. 12 | url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/6395244?n=20&printThumbnails=no |accessdate=January 31, 2012 }}</ref> \"The sick, the dying, and the dead were indiscriminately mingled together. The ordure and other evacuations of the sick, were allowed to remain in the most offensive state imaginable... It was, in fact, a great human slaughter-house.\"{{sfn|Carey|1793|p=32}} On September 15, Peter Helm, a barrel maker, and [[Stephen Girard]], a merchant and shipowner born in France, volunteered to personally manage the hospital and represent the Mayor's Committee.<ref>Minutes, p. 18.</ref>\n\nThey made rapid improvements in hospital operations: bedsteads were repaired and more brought from the prison so patients would not have to lie on the floor. A barn was adapted as a place for convalescing patients. On September 17, the managers hired 9 female nurses and 10 male attendants, as well as a female matron. They assigned the 14 rooms to separate male and female patients. With the discovery of a spring on the estate, workers were organized to have clean water pumped into the hospital. Helm and Girard informed the Committee that they could accommodate more than the 60 patients then under their care, and soon the hospital had 140 patients.<ref>Minutes, pp. 17ff.</ref>\n\nGirard found that the intermittent visits by four young physicians from the city added to the confusion about patient treatment. He hired [[Jean Deveze]], a French doctor with experience treating yellow fever in [[Saint-Domingue]] (now Haiti). Deveze cared only for the patients at the hospital, and he was assisted by French apothecaries. Deveze admired Girard's fearlessness in his devotion to the patients. In a memoir published in 1794, Deveze wrote of Girard: <blockquote>I even saw one of the diseased ... [discharge] the contents of his stomach upon [him]. What did Girard do? ... He wiped the patient's cloaths, comforted [him] ... arranged the bed, [and] inspired with courage, by renewing in him the hope that he should recover. \u2014From him he went to another, that vomited offensive matter that would have disheartened any other than this wonderful man.<ref>{{cite web | last=Deveze | first=Jean | title=An Inquiry into and Observations upon the Causes and Effects of the Epidemic Disease Which Raged in Philadelphia, 1794, p. 26 | year=1794| url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/7374528?n=34&printThumbnails=no |accessdate=February 20, 2012 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNews that patients treated at the hospital were recovering encouraged many people to believe that medicine was gaining control of the fever. But, it soon became clear that mortality at the hospital remained high; about 50% of those admitted died.{{sfn|Rush|1794|p=320}}\n\n==Reactions by other cities==\nAs the death toll in the city rose, officials in neighboring communities and major port cities such as New York and [[Baltimore]] established quarantines for refugees and goods from Philadelphia. New York established a \"Committee appointed to prevent the spreading and introduction of infectious diseases in this city\", which set up citizen patrols to monitor entry to the city. Stage coaches from Philadelphia were not allowed in many cities. [[Havre de Grace, Maryland]], for example, tried to prevent people from Philadelphia from crossing the [[Susquehanna River]] to Maryland.{{sfn|Powell|1993|pp=216ff}}{{sfn|Carey|1793|pp=47ff}} Neighboring cities did send food supplies and money; for example, New York City sent $5000 to the Mayor's Committee.<ref>Minutes, pp 36ff.</ref>\n \n[[Woodbury, New Jersey|Woodbury]] and [[Springfield, Burlington County, New Jersey|Springfield, New Jersey]]; [[Chester, Pennsylvania]] and [[Elkton, Maryland]], were among towns that accepted refugees.{{sfn|Carey|1793|pp=59ff}} President Washington corresponded with members of his cabinet on where to assemble if the epidemic prevented Congress from meeting as scheduled in December. Washington decided to hold the cabinet in early November in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]], at that time an independent town ten miles from the heart of Philadelphia.\n\n==Carey's accusations==\nIn his 1793 account of the epidemic, Mathew Carey contrasted the sacrifices of men like Joseph Inskeep, a Quaker who served on the Mayor's Committee and also visited the sick, with the selfishness of others. When Inskeep contracted the fever, he asked for the assistance of a family whom he had attended when several of its members were sick. They refused; he died, which might have happened even with their aid. Carey reported their refusal.{{sfn|Carey|1793|p=79}}\n\nHe published rumors of greed, especially by landlords who threw convalescing tenants into the street to gain control of their flats.{{sfn|Carey|1793|p=75}} While he praised [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]] and [[Absalom Jones]] for their work,<ref name=\"Winch\">{{cite web|title=Africans in America \u2013 Part 3: Brotherly Love (1791\u20131831) \u2013 Philadelphia/Modern Voices/Julie Winch on Jones' and Allen's response to Carey |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3i3111.html |date=1998 |work=[[PBS]] |access-date=March 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308222735/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3i3111.html |archive-date=March 8, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> he suggested that blacks had caused the epidemic, and that some black nurses had charged high fees and even stolen from those for whom they cared.{{sfn|Carey|1793|p=63}}\n\nAllen and Jones quickly wrote a pamphlet to defend the people of color in the crisis. The historian Julie Winch believes they wanted to defend their community, knowing how powerful Carey was, and wanting to maintain the reputation of their people in the aftermath of the epidemic.<ref name=\"Winch\"/>  The men noted that the first nurses from the Free African Society had worked without any pay. As the mortality rate increased, they had to hire men to get anyone to deal with the sick and dying. They recounted that <blockquote>the great prices paid did not escape the observation of that worthy and vigilant magistrate, [[Matthew Clarkson]], mayor of the city, and president of the committee. He sent for us, and requested we would use our influence to lessen the wages of the nurses. But on informing him of the cause, i.e. that of the people over-bidding one another, it was concluded unnecessary to attempt any thing on that head; therefore it was left to the people concerned.</blockquote> Allen and Jones noted that white nurses also profited and stole from their patients. \"We know that six pounds was demanded by and paid to a white woman, for putting a corpse into a coffin; and forty dollars was demanded and paid to four white men, for bringing it down the stairs.\" Many black nurses served without compensation: <blockquote>\"A poor black man, named Sampson, went constantly from house to house where distress was, and no assistance, without fee or reward. He was smitten with the disorder, and died. After his death his family were neglected by those he had served. Sarah Bass, a poor black widow, gave all the assistance she could, in several families, for which she did not receive any thing; and when any thing was offered her, she left it to the option of those she served.\"{{sfn|Allen|Jones|1794|pp=9\u201311}}</blockquote>\n\n==Response of churches==\nChurch clergy continued to hold services, which helped keep up residents' morale. Rev. J. Henry C. Helmuth, who led the city's German Lutheran congregation, wrote ''A Short Account of the Yellow Fever in Philadelphia for the Reflecting Christian.'' He also left a diary. On September 16 he reported that his church was \"very full\" the day before. In one week in October, 130 members of his congregation were buried. On October 13, he wrote in his diary: <blockquote>Preached to a large gathering about Jes.26,1. I showed that Philadelphia a very blessed city\u2014the Lord is among us and especially in our congregation. I proved this with examples of dead and still living people. Baptized a child.

The meetinghouse is not far from the waterfront where the epidemic had started. In their Yearly Epistle following the meeting, the Friends wrote that to have changed the time or place of the meeting would have been a \"haughty attempt\" to escape \"the rod\" of God, from which there was no escape.<ref>\"Yearly Meeting Epistle 1793,\" Swarthmore College Library Quaker Collection; see also letter by Margaret Morris to her daughter August 31, 1793, Haverford College Library Manuscript Collection.</ref> The Quaker John Todd, who attended the meeting, contracted the fever and died of it.

At first they hoped a seasonal \"equinoctial gale,\" or hurricane, common at that time of year, would blow away the fever. Heavy rains in late September seemed to correlate with a higher rate of cases. Residents next anticipated freezing temperatures at night, which they knew were associated with ending fall fevers. By the first two weeks of October and peak of the crisis, gloom pervaded the city. Most churches had stopped holding services, and the post office moved out of the area of the highest number of cases. The market days continued, and bakers continued to make and distribute bread.<ref>''Federal Gazette,'' October 5, 1793.</ref> Several members of the Mayor's Committee died. African-American nurses had also begun dying of the fever. Carts took ill victims to Bush Hill and the dead to burial grounds. Doctors also suffered illness and death, and fewer were available to care for patients. Three of Rush's apprentices and his sister died; he was too sick to leave his house. Such news cast doubts on Rush's methods, but none of those victims had submitted to his harsh treatment.{{sfn|Rush|1794|pp=349\u2013350}}\n\nThose refugees from Saint-Domingue who thought they had immunity used the streets freely, but few other residents did. Those who had not escaped the city tried to wait out the epidemic in their homes. When the Mayor's Committee took a quick census of the dead, they found that the majority of victims were poor people, who died in homes located in the alleys, behind the main streets where most of the business of city was conducted.<ref>Minutes, pp. 51, 241ff.</ref>\n\nOn October 16, after temperatures cooled, a newspaper reported that \"the malignant fever has very considerably abated.\"<ref>''Federal Gazette,'' October 16, 1793</ref> Stores began to reopen October 25, many families returned, and the wharves were \"once more enlivened\" as a London-based ship arrived with goods.<ref>''Federal Gazette,'' October 25, 1793.</ref> The Mayor's Committee advised people outside the city to wait another week or 10 days before returning. It published directions for cleaning houses which had been closed up, recommending that they be aired for several days with all windows and doors open. \"Burning of nitre will correct the corrupt air which they may contain. Quick lime should be thrown into the privies and the chambers whitewashed.\" On the 31st, a white flag was hoisted over Bush Hill with the legend, \"No More Sick Persons Here.\"<ref>''Federal Gazette,'' November 1, 1793.</ref>\n\nBut, after some warm days, fever cases recurred. The white flag had to be struck. Finally on November 13, stagecoaches resumed service to the north and south. A merchant reported that the streets were \"in an uproar and rendered the wharves impossible by reason of the vast quantities of wine, sugar, rum, coffee, cotton & c. The porters are quite savvy and demand extravagantly for anything they do.\"<ref>Welsh papers, November 13, 1793, Historical Society of Pennsylvania.</ref> On November 14, the Mayor's Committee recommended purifying houses, clothing and bedding, but said that anyone could come to the city \"without danger from the late prevailing disorder.\"<ref>''Minutes,'' p. 120.</ref>\n\n==Lists of the dead==\nAn official register of deaths listed 4044 people as dying between August 1 and November 9, 1793 based on grave counts, so the total was probably higher. City officials, medical and religious leaders, and newspaper publishers reported the number and names of victims, based on the minutes of the Mayor's Committee. The Appendix of on-line edition of Minutes lists the names of all the patients admitted to Bush Hill hospital, as well as the disposition of their cases.<ref>Minutes, pp. 205\u2013232.</ref> The publisher Mathew Carey released his history of the epidemic just weeks after its end. He listed the names of the dead at the back of the book, which is one reason it was a bestseller.{{sfn|Carey|1793|pp=121\u2013164}} While Deveze did not reveal his patients' names in describing his treatments, Rush named his patients in his memoir.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Controversies over the epidemic==\nThe end of the epidemic did not end the controversies among the city's doctors, who disagreed about causes and treatment. Hearing rumors that colleagues were going to try to get him expelled from the College of Physicians, Rush resigned and formed a new medical society, which many of the city's younger doctors joined.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Rush's promotion of his remedies and attacks on others were strongly criticized by the medical community.\n\n===Cause===\nMerchants worried more about Rush's theory that the fever arose from the filth of Philadelphia and was not imported from the West Indies. They did not want the port's reputation to suffer permanently. Doctors used his treatments while rejecting his etiology of the disease. Others deprecated his therapies, such as Dr. Deveze, but agreed that the fever had local origins. Deveze had arrived on the refugee ship from Saint-Domingue which many accused of having carried the disease, but he thought it healthy. The doctors did not understand the origin or transmittal of the disease.<ref>{{cite web | last=Deveze | first=Jean | title=Inquiry p. 12 | url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/7374528?n=20&printThumbnails=no |accessdate=January 31, 2012 }}</ref> Historians believe it was brought by refugees from Saint-Domingue, where it was endemic, and transmitted by mosquitoes between the infected and healthy persons.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Differing courses of treatment===\nDr. Kuhn advised drinking wine, \"at first weaker wines, such as claret and Rhenish; if these cannot be had, Lisbon or Madeira diluted with rich lemonade. The quantity is to be determined by the effects it produces and by the state of debility which prevails, guarding against its occasioning or encreasing <!--this archaic spelling of the word \"increasing\" is used in the original, 18th-century source--> the heat, restlessness or delirium.\" He placed \"the greatest dependence for the cure to the disease, on throwing cool water twice a day over the naked body. The patient is to be placed in a large empty tub, and two buckets full of water, of the temperature 75 or 80 degrees Fahrenheit's thermometer, according to the state of the atmosphere, are to be thrown on him.\" The water treatment was also advocated by Dr. Edward Stevens, who in mid-September claimed it had cured [[Alexander Hamilton]], Secretary of the Treasury, of the fever.<ref>''General Advertiser,'' September 11, 1793, also in Rush, pp. 207ff</ref>\n\nRush searched the medical literature for other approaches. Benjamin Franklin had given him letters sent by Dr. John Mitchell, related to treating patients during a 1741 yellow fever outbreak in Virginia. (Franklin never published the letters.) Mitchell noted that the stomach and intestines filled with blood and that these organs had to be emptied at all costs. \"On this account,\" Mitchell argued, \"an ill-timed scrupulousness about the weakness of the body is of bad consequences in these urging circumstances.... I can affirm that I have given a purge in this case, when the pulse has been so low that it can hardly be felt, and the debility extreme, yet both one and the other have been restored by it.\"{{sfn|Rush|1794|pp=127ff}}<ref>In a manuscript of 1744, [[John Mitchell (geographer)|Dr. John Mitchell]] of Virginia detailed his observations and treatments of victims of a \"yellow fever\" epidemic in 1741\u20132; copies of the manuscript were sent to Mr. [[Cadwallader Colden]], a physician in New York, and to Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]] of Philadelphia; the manuscript was eventually printed (in large part) in 1805 and reprinted (in full) in 1814.

Since the demand for his services was so great, he had his assistants make as many of his powders in pill form as they could.\n\nOn September 10, he published a guide to treating the fever: \"Dr. Rush's Directions for Curing and Treating the Yellow Fever\", outlining a regimen of self-medication. At the first sign of symptoms, \"more especially if those symptoms be accompanied by a redness, or faint yellowness in the eyes, and dull or shooting pains about the region of the liver, take one of the powders in a little sugar and water, every six hours, until they produce four or five large evacuations from the bowels...\" He urged that the patient stay in bed and \"drink plentifully\" of barley or chicken water. Then after the \"bowels are thoroughly cleaned,\" it was proper to take 8 to 10 ounces of blood from the arm if, after purging, the pulse was full or tense. To keep the body open he recommended more calomel or small doses of cream of tarter or other salts. If the pulse was weak and low, he recommended camomile or snakeroot as a stimulant, and blisters or blankets soaked in hot vinegar wrapped around the lower limbs. To restore the patient he recommended \"gruel, sago, panada, tapioca, tea, coffee, weak chocolate, wine whey, chicken broth, and white meats, according to the weak or active state of the system; the fruits of the season may be eaten with advantage at all times.\" The sick room should be kept cool and vinegar should be sprinkled around the floor.{{sfn|Rush|1794|p=211}}\n\nRush's therapy was generalized as \"purge and bleed,\" and as long as the patient remained debilitated, Rush urged further purging and bleeding. Not a few of his patients became comatose. The calomel in his pills soon brought on a state of constant salivation, which Rush urged patients to attain to assure a cure. A characteristic sign of death was black vomit, which salivation seemed to ward off.<ref>Rush, p to come.</ref> Since he urged purging at the first sign of fever, other doctors began seeing patients who suffered severe abdominal distress.

He later discussed treatment in his memoir, which included 18 case studies and descriptions of several autopsies. While he deprecated Rush's harsh purgatives and \"heroic\" bleeding, he moderately bled patients and also used medicines to evacuate the bowels. Like Rush, he thought poisons had to be \"abstracted\" in severely debilitated patients. Instead of purges, he used blisters to raise welts on the skin.<ref>{{cite web | last=Deveze | first=Jean | title=Inquiry p 60 | url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/7374528?n=68&printThumbnails=no |accessdate=January 31, 2012 }}</ref> Unlike Kuhn, he did not favor baths.

The city suffered yellow fever epidemics in 1797, 1798, and 1799, which kept the origin and treatment controversies alive.<ref>{{cite web | last=Rush | first=Benjamin | title=Observations Upon the Origin of the Malignant Bilious, or Yellow Fever in Philadelphia, and Upon the Means of Preventing It: Addressed to the Citizens of Philadelphia | url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/6483213?n=3&imagesize=1200&jp2Res=.25&printThumbnails=no | accessdate=March 22, 2012 }}, Harvard University Library</ref>\n\nSome of the city's clergy suggested the epidemic was a judgment from God.<ref>\"An Earnest Call Occasioned by the Alarming Pestilential Contagion,\" November 8, 1793, Evans catalog #25427.</ref> Led by the Quakers, the religious community petitioned the state legislature to prohibit theatrical presentations in the state.

After an extensive debate in the newspapers, the State Assembly denied the petition.<ref>''Federal Gazette,'' November 19, 1793 and ''Philadelphia Gazette,'' March 25, 1794.</ref>\n\nThe recurrences of yellow fever kept discussions about causes, treatment and prevention going until the end of decade. Other major ports also had epidemics, beginning with Baltimore in 1794, New York in 1795 and 1798, and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] in 1798, making yellow fever a national crisis. New York doctors finally admitted that they had had an outbreak of yellow fever in 1791 that killed more than 100 people. All the cities that suffered epidemics continued to grow rapidly. The widespread recognition that the epidemics were based along the waterfront meant that cities grew more rapidly in outlying areas, but that was also where land was available at lower cost. Families who could afford it planned to vacate the port cities during the sick season.\n\nDuring the epidemic of 1798, Benjamin Rush commuted daily from a house just outside the city, near what is now 15th and Columbia Streets, to the new city fever hospital, where as chief doctor he treated fever victims.<ref>Butterfield, p. 803.</ref>  The civic responses to the 1798 epidemics in Philadelphia and New York were more complex than the efforts of the 1793 Mayor's Committee. For instance, Philadelphia forced evacuation of certain neighborhoods and placed refugees in supervised camps. After the epidemic, the city inspected all houses and destroyed those it deemed unhealthy.\n\nAmerican doctors did not identify the vector of yellow fever until the late nineteenth century. In 1881 [[Carlos Finlay]], a Cuban doctor, argued that mosquito bites caused yellow fever; he credited Rush's published account of the 1793 epidemic for giving him the idea. He said that Rush had written: \"Mosquitoes (the usual attendants of a sickly autumn) were uncommonly numerous...\"{{sfn|Rush|1794|p=108}} In the late 1880s, Finlay's theories were confirmed in Cuba by experiments of the US Medical Army Corps under direction of Dr. [[Walter Reed]] in the late 1880s, in which subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by infected mosquitoes.\n\nIn the first week of September 1793, Dr. William Currie published a description of the epidemic and an account of its progress during August. The publisher Mathew Carey had an account of the epidemic for sale in the third week of October, before the epidemic had ended.<ref name=\"Carey\">{{cite web|title=Africans in America \u2013 Part 3: Brotherly Love (1791\u20131831) \u2013 Philadelphia/Historical Documents/A Short Account of the Malignant Fever... |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3h460.html |date=1998 |work=[[PBS]] |access-date=March 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321235146/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3h460.html |archive-date=March 21, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> He accused blacks of causing the epidemic and black nurses of overcharging patients and taking advantage of them. The reverends [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]] and [[Absalom Jones]] of the Free African Society published their own account rebutting Carey's attacks; by that time Carey had already published the fourth edition of his popular pamphlet.<ref name=\"Carey\"/> Allen and Jones noted that some blacks had worked for free, that they had died at the same rate as whites from the epidemic, and that some whites had also overcharged for their services.\n\nCurrie's work was the first of several medical accounts published within a year of the epidemic. Dr. Benjamin Rush published an account more than 300 pages long. Two French doctors, Jean Deveze and Nassy, published shorter accounts. Clergymen also published accounts; the most notable was by the Lutheran minister J. Henry C. Helmuth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bobarnebeck.com/helmuth.html|title=Rev. Helmuth's Diary|website=bobarnebeck.com|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref> In March 1794, the Mayor's Committee published its minutes. (Letters written during the epidemic, which in some cases expressed the last sentiments of victims, were preserved by many families and have been a source for scholars in various archives.){{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe rapid succession of other yellow fever epidemics in Philadelphia and elsewhere in the northeastern United States engendered many accounts of the efforts to contain, control and cope with the disease. Rush wrote accounts of the 1797, 1798, and 1799 epidemics in Philadelphia. He revised his account of the 1793 epidemic to eliminate reference to the disease being contagious. He varied his cures. In 1798 he was appointed as the chief doctor at the fever hospital. The mortality rate that year was roughly the same as it had been at Bush Hill in 1793, despite radical difference between the therapies used.\n\n[[Noah Webster]], then a notable New York newspaper publisher, joined two doctors in publishing the ''Medical Repository,'' a magazine that collected accounts of fever epidemics throughout the nation. Webster used this data in his 1798 book, suggesting that the nation was being subjected to a widespread \"epidemic constitution\" in the atmosphere that might last 50 years and make deadly epidemics almost certain.<ref>Webster, Noah, ''A Brief History of Epidemic Disease,'' 1798.</ref> Yellow fever epidemics became seen as a national crisis. When in 1855 a French doctor published an 813-page history of yellow fever in Philadelphia, covering outbreaks from 1699 to 1854, he devoted only a few pages to the 1793 epidemic.<ref>LaRoche, ''Yellow Fever, considered in its historical, pathological, etiological, and therapeutic relations,'' 1855</ref>\n\nGeneral 20th-century US histories, such as the 10-volume ''Great Epochs in American History,'' published in 1912, used short excerpts from Carey's account.<ref>Halsey, Francis W., ''Great Epochs in American History,'' volume 4, 1912, pp 83\u201389</ref> The first history of the epidemic to draw on more primary sources was J.

Since the mid-twentieth century, scholars have studied aspects of the epidemic, first in papers.

The vast majority of them died of [[yellow fever]], making the epidemic in the city of 50,000 people one of the most severe in United States history. By the end of September, 20,000 people had fled the city. The mortality rate peaked in October, before frost finally killed the mosquitoes and brought an end to the epidemic in November. Doctors tried a variety of treatments, but knew neither the origin of the fever nor that it was transmitted by mosquitoes (which was not verified until the late nineteenth century).\n\nThe mayor and a committee of two dozen organized a fever hospital at Bush Hill and other crisis measures. The assistance of the [[Free African Society]] was requested by the city and readily agreed to by the members, based on the mistaken assumption that native Africans would have the same partial immunity to the new disease as many had to [[malaria]], the most common source of fever epidemics during the summer months.<ref>From [[Genetic resistance to malaria]]: ''\"Where this parasite [p. falciparum] is endemic, young children have repeated malaria attacks. [...] Repeated malaria infections strengthen adaptive immunity and broaden its effects against parasites expressing different to the good old immunity against malaria.\"''</ref> Black nurses aided the sick and the group's leaders hired additional men to take away corpses, which most people would not touch. Blacks in the city died at the same rate as whites, about 240 altogether.\n\nSome neighboring towns refused to let refugees in from Philadelphia, for fear they were carrying the fever. Major port cities such as Baltimore and New York had quarantines against refugees and goods from Philadelphia although New York sent financial aid to the city.\n\n==Beginnings==\nIn the spring of 1793, French colonial refugees, some with slaves, arrived from [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap Fran\u00e7ais]], [[Saint-Domingue]] (now Haiti). The 2,000 immigrants were fleeing the [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolution]] in the north of the island.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite journal|title=Andrew Brown's \"Earnest Endeavor\": The Federal Gazette's Role in Philadelphia's Yellow Fever Epidemic of 1793 |first=Mark A. |last=Smith |journal=[[Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography]] |volume=120 |issue=4 |date=October 1996 |pages=321\u2013342 |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania Press]] |url=https://journals.psu.edu/pmhb/article/view/45107/44828 |via=[[Pennsylvania State University Libraries]]}}</ref> They crowded the port of Philadelphia, where the first yellow fever epidemic in 30 years began in the city in August.<ref name=\"Smith\"/>{{sfn|Rush|1794|p=6}} It is likely that the refugees and ships carried the yellow fever [[virus]] and mosquitoes. It is transmitted during mosquito bites. The mosquitoes easily breed in small amounts of standing water. The medical community and others in 1793 did not understand the role of mosquitoes in the transmission of yellow fever and other diseases. Physicians and other survivors of the epidemic wrote extensively about it trying to learn from the crisis.\n\nIn the ports and coastal areas of the United States, even in the northeast, the months of August and September were considered the \"sickly season,\" when fevers were prevalent. In the South, planters and other people wealthy enough usually left the Low Country during this season. Natives thought that newcomers especially had to undergo a \"seasoning\" and were more likely to die of what were thought to be seasonal fevers in their early years in the region.<ref>Currie, William, ''An Historical Account of the Climate and Diseases of the United States,'' Philadelphia: T. Dobson, 1792</ref> Philadelphia then was the temporary capital of the United States, and the government was due to return in the fall. President George Washington left the city.\n\nThe first two people to die of yellow fever in early August in Philadelphia were both recent immigrants, one from [[Ireland]] and the other from Saint-Domingue. Letters describing their cases were published in a pamphlet about a month after they died. The young doctor sent by the Overseers of the Poor to treat the Irish woman was perplexed, and his treatment did not save her.{{sfn|Currie|1793|pp=29\u201330}}\n\nA 2013 book by Billy G. Smith, professor of history at Montana State University, makes a case that the principal vector of the 1793 plague in Philadelphia (and other Atlantic ports) was the British merchant ship ''Hankey'', which had fled the West African colony of [[Bolama]] (an island off West Africa, present day [[Guinea-Bissau]]) the previous November, trailing yellow fever at every port of call in the Caribbean and eastern Atlantic seaboard.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ship of Death: A Voyage That Changed the Atlantic World |last=Smith |first=Billy G. |date=2013 |publisher=[[Yale University Press]] |location=New Haven & London |url=https://yalebooks.co.uk/display.asp?k=9780300194524 |isbn=978-0-300-19452-4}}</ref>\n\n==Epidemic declared==\nAfter two weeks and an increasing number of fever cases, Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]], a doctor's apprentice during the city's 1762<ref>{{cite book|author=Jim Murphy|title=An Amegoogle.com/books?id=DmWTBAAAQBAJ|year=2014|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-547-53285-1|page=31}}</ref> yellow fever epidemic, saw the pattern; he recognized that yellow fever had returned. Rush alerted his colleagues and the government that the city faced an epidemic of \"highly contagious, as well as mortal... bilious remitting yellow fever.\"{{sfn|Rush|1794|p=13}} Adding to the alarm was that, unlike with most fevers, the principal victims were not the very young or very old. Many of the early deaths were teenagers and heads of families in the dockside areas.<ref>Butterfield, L. H., editor, ''Letters of Benjamin Rush,'' vol. 2, p 641.</ref> Believing that the refugees from Saint-Domingue were carrying the disease, the city imposed a quarantine of two to three weeks on immigrants and their goods, but was unable to enforce it as the epidemic increased its reach.<ref name=\"Epidemic\"/>\n\nThen the largest city in the US, with around 50,000 residents, Philadelphia was relatively compact and most houses were within seven blocks of its major port on the Delaware River. Docking facilities extended from Southwark south of the city to Kensington to the north. Cases of fever clustered at first around the Arch Street wharf. Rush blamed \"some damaged coffee which putrefied on the wharf near Arch Street\" for causing the fevers. Soon cases appeared in Kensington.{{sfn|Rush|1794|p=17}} As the port was critical to the state's economy, the Pennsylvania governor, [[Thomas Mifflin]], had responsibility for its health. He asked the port physician, Dr. James Hutchinson, to assess conditions. The doctor found that 67 of about 400 residents near the Arch Street wharf were sick, but only 12 had \"malignant fevers.\"<ref>''American Daily Advertiser,'' August 28, 1793.</ref>  Alarmed by what Rush and others told him, Mayor [[Matthew Clarkson]] asked the city's medical society, the [[College of Physicians of Philadelphia|College of Physicians]], to meet and advise the city's government and citizens how to proceed.\n\nRush later described some early cases: On August 7, he treated a young man for headaches, fever and vomiting, and on the 15th treated his brother. On the same day a woman he was treating turned yellow. On the 18th a man in the third day of a fever had no pulse, was cold, clammy, and yellow, but he could sit up in his bed. He died a few hours later. On the 19th a woman Rush visited died within hours. Another physician said five persons within sight of her door died. None of those victims was a recent immigrant.{{sfn|Rush|1794|pp=9\u201311}}\n\nThe College published a letter in the city's newspapers, written by a committee headed by Rush, suggesting 11 measures to prevent the \"progress\" of the fever. They warned citizens to avoid fatigue, the hot sun, night air, too much liquor, and anything else that might lower their resistance. Vinegar and camphor in infected rooms \"cannot be used too frequently upon handkerchiefs, or in smelling bottles, by persons whose duty calls to visit or attend the sick.\" They outlined measures for city officials: stopping the tolling of church bells and making burials private; cleaning streets and wharves; exploding gunpowder in the street to increase the amount of oxygen. Everyone should avoid unnecessary contact with the sick.{{sfn|Rush|1794|pp=21ff}} Crews were sent to clean the wharves, streets and the market, which cheered those remaining in the city.<ref>''Federal Gazette,'' August 31, 1793.</ref> Many of those who could left the city.\n\nElizabeth Drinker, a married Quaker woman, kept a journal for years; her account from August 23 through August 30 tells the quickening story of the spread of the disease in the city and the rising toll of deaths. She also describes the many people leaving the city.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Drinker | first=Elizabeth |  title= Extracts from the Journal of Elizabeth Drinker, From 1759 to 1807, A.D.| editor= Biddle, Henry D. | location=Philadelphia | publisher= J.B.

The Seat of Wm. Hamilton Esqr. near Philadelphia'', by [[James Peller Malcolm]]. Bush Hill was the country seat of James Hamilton by this time.]]\nThe Guardians of the Poor took over Bush Hill, a 150-acre estate farther outside the city, whose owner William Hamilton was in England for an extended stay. Vice President [[John Adams]] had recently rented the main house, so yellow fever patients were placed in the outbuildings.{{sfn|Carey|1793|pp=19\u201320}}{{sfn|Powell|1993|pp=58\u201362}} Nurses were hired to treat patients, under orders by young physicians from the city, who were to visit on a daily basis.\n\nThe end of August was not traditionally a busy time in the city. Many families who could afford to or who had relatives in the countryside lived elsewhere during that hot month. Beginning in September, shipments generally increased with the arrival of fall goods from Britain. In 1793, the Federal Congress was not scheduled to resume session until November, but the Pennsylvania Assembly met in the first week of September. Founded by the Quaker [[William Penn]], the city was the center of Quaker life in the United States. The Yearly Meeting of the Society of Friends was scheduled to be held in the third week of September.\n\n===Panic and refugees===\nBetween the College's advisory on August 25 and the death of Dr. Hutchinson from yellow fever on September 7, panic spread throughout the city; more people fled. Between August 1 and September 7, 456 people died in the city; 42 deaths were reported on September 8.{{sfn|Rush|1794|pp=129ff}} An estimated 20,000 people left the city through September, including national leaders.<ref name=\"Epidemic\">{{cite web|title=Africans in America \u2013 Part 3: Brotherly Love (1791\u20131831) \u2013 Philadelphia/People & Events/The Yellow Fever epidemic |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3p1590.html |date=1998 |work=[[PBS]] |access-date=March 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321120827/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3p1590.html |archive-date=March 21, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> The daily death toll remained above 30 until October 26. The worst seven-day period was between October 7 and 13, when 711 deaths were reported.{{sfn|Rush|1794|pp=129ff}}\n\nSome neighboring towns had patrols on the roads to prevent entry by refugees. The major ports of Baltimore and New York prevented refugees from entering and quarantined them and goods from Philadelphia for weeks.\n\nThe publisher [[Mathew Carey]] published a short pamphlet later in the fall in which he described the changes that had occurred in the life of the city:\n<blockquote>\"Those who ventured abroad, had handkerchiefs or sponges impregnated with vinegar of [[camphor]] at their noses, or smelling-bottles full of the thieves\u2019 vinegar. Others carried pieces of tarred rope in their hands or pockets, or camphor bags tied round their necks.... People hastily shifted their course at the sight of a hearse coming towards them. Many never walked on the footpath, but went into the middle of the streets, to avoid being infected in passing by houses wherein people had died. Acquaintances and friends avoided each other in the streets, and only signified their regard by a cold nod. The old custom of shaking hands fell in such general disuse, that many shrunk back with affright at even the offer of a hand. A person with crape [mourning crepe], or any appearance of mourning, was shunned like a viper.\"{{sfn|Carey|1793|p=22}}</blockquote>\n\n==Black nurses==\nThe College of Physicians' advisory implied the fever was contagious and people should avoid contact with its victims although \"duty\" required that they be cared for. Yet in families, when the person with the fever was a mother or father, they could forbid their children from coming near them. Rush knew of Dr. John Lining's observation during the 1742 yellow fever epidemic in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], that African slaves appeared to be affected at rates lower than whites; he thought they had a natural immunity. Writing a short letter to the newspapers under the pseudonym \"[[Anthony Benezet]],\" a Quaker who had provided schooling for blacks, Rush suggested that the city's people of color had immunity and solicited them \"to offer your services to attend the sick to help those known in distress.\"<ref name=\"Allen\"/><ref>''American Daily Advertiser,'' September 2, 1793.</ref> [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]] and [[Absalom Jones]] recalled their reaction to the letter in a memoir they published shortly after the epidemic:\n\n<blockquote>Early in September, a solicitation appeared in the public papers, to the people of colour to come forward and assist the distressed, perishing, and neglected sick; with a kind of assurance, that people of our colour were not liable to take the infection. Upon which we and a few others met and consulted how to act on so truly alarming and melancholy occasion. After some conversation, we found a freedom to go forth, confiding in Him who can preserve in the midst of a burning fiery furnace, sensible that it was our duty to do all the good we could to our suffering fellow mortals. We set out to see where we could be useful. The first we visited was a man in Emsley's alley, who was dying, and his wife lay dead at the time in the house, there were none to assist but two poor helpless children. We administered what relief we could, and applied to the overseers of the poor to have the woman buried. We visited upwards of twenty families that day\u2014they were scenes of woe indeed! The Lord was plentiful to strengthen us, and removed all fear from us...<ref name=\"Allen\">{{cite web | last=Allen | first=Richard | title=A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People.... | url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/6483355?n=3&printThumbnails=no |accessdate=January 31, 2012 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>In order the better to regulate our conduct, we called on the mayor the next day, to consult with him on how to proceed, so as to be the most useful. The first object he recommended was a strict attention to the sick, and the procuring of nurses. This was attended to by Absalom Jones and William Gray; and, in order that the distressed might know where to apply, the mayor advised that upon application to them they would be supplied. Soon after, the mortality increased, the difficulty of getting a corpse taken away, was such, that few were willing to do it, when offered great rewards. The black people were looked to. We then offered our services in the public papers, by advertising that we would remove the dead and procure nurses. Our services were the production of real sensibility\u2014we sought not fee nor reward, until the increase of the disorder rendered our labour so arduous that we were not adequate to the service we had assumed.<ref name=\"Allen\"/></blockquote>\n\nAllen noted in his account that because of the increase in mortality, he and Jones had to hire five men to assist them in removing corpses, as most people avoided the sick and the dead.<ref name=\"Allen\"/>  In a September 6 letter to his wife, Rush said that the \"African brethren ... furnish nurses to most of my patients.\"<ref>Butterfield, p. 654</ref> Despite Rush's theory, most of the city's people of color were not immune to the fever. Many of the slaves in Charleston in 1742 could have gained immunity before having been transported from Africa, by having been exposed to yellow fever in a mild case. People who survived one attack gained immunity.{{sfn|Allen|Jones|1794|pp=15\u201316}} A total of 240 blacks died, in proportion to their population at the same rate as whites.<ref name=\"Epidemic\"/>\n\n==Controversy over treatment==\nGiven the limited resources and knowledge of the times, the city's response was credible. The medical community did not know the natural history of yellow fever, a viral infection spread by the ''[[Aedes aegypti]]'' mosquito. Efforts to clean the city did not defeat the spread of the fever as the mosquitoes bred in the clean water. Philadelphia's newspapers continued to publish during the epidemic, and through the doctors and others tried to understand and combat the epidemic. On September 7, Dr. Adam Kuhn advised patients to treat symptoms as they arose; he had studied medicine at the [[University of Uppsala]] in Sweden.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Marion E. |last=Brown |title=Adam Kuhn: Eighteenth Century Physician and Teacher |journal=[[Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences]] |volume=V |date=March 1, 1950 |issue=Spring 1950 |pages=163\u2013177 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/V.Spring.163|pmid=15412232 }}</ref>\n\nRush claimed that he tried Kuhn's and Steven's stimulating remedies, and his patients still died. He recommended other treatments, including purging and [[bloodletting]], and published his theories. The hope offered by any of these treatments was soon dashed when it became clear that they did not cure the disease, and the doctors' competing claims demoralized patients.<ref name=\"Butterfield, pp 1213-18\">Butterfield, pp 1213\u201318.</ref>\n\nIn his 1794 account of the epidemic, Matthew Carey noted that other doctors claimed to have used [[Mercury(I)_chloride|calomel]] (a [[Mercury_(element)|mercury]] compound) before Rush and that \"its efficacy was great and rescued many from death.\" Carey added that the \"efficacy of bleeding, in all cases not attended with putridity, was great.\"{{sfn|Carey|1793|p=15}} Rush taught the African-American nurses how to bleed and purge patients. Allen and Jones wrote that they were thankful that \"we have been the instruments, in the hand of God, for saving the lives of hundreds of our suffering fellow mortals.\"{{sfn|Allen|Jones|1794|p=5}} Rush's brand of medicine became the standard American treatment for fevers in the 1790s and was widely used for the next 50 years.<ref>Duffy, William, ''From Humors to Medical Science,'' 1993, pp 68\u201371</ref>\n\nRush's claim that his remedies cured 99 out of 100 patients have led historians and modern doctors to ridicule his remedies and approach to medical science. Some contemporaries also attacked him. The newspaper editor [[William Cobbett]] attacked Rush's therapies and called him a ''Sangrado'', after a character in ''[[Gil Blas]]'', who bled patients to death. In 1799 Rush won a $5,000 libel judgment against Cobbett.<ref name=\"Butterfield, pp 1213-18\"/>\n\n==Government responses to crisis==\nThe responses of the various levels of government in the city varied. The Federal government had no authority to act and Congress had not been in session since June. President Washington and his cabinet continued to meet until he left the city on September 10 for his scheduled vacation, a period that included laying the cornerstone on September 18 of the new US Capitol to be built in the City of Washington, the designated capital. Employees of the Treasury Department, who collected customs and worked on the country's financial system, worked throughout the epidemic; the post office also stayed open.\n\nThe state legislature cut short its September session after a dead body was found on the steps of State House. Governor Mifflin became ill and was advised by his doctor to leave. The city's banks remained open. But, banking operations were so slowed by the inability of people to pay off notes because of disruptions from the epidemic that banks automatically renewed notes until the epidemic ended.{{sfn|Carey|1793|p=12}}\n\nThe mayor [[Matthew Clarkson (mayor)|Matthew Clarkson]] organized the city's response to the epidemic. Most of the Common Council members fled, along with 20,000 other residents. People who did not leave Philadelphia before the second week in September could leave the city only with great difficulty, and they faced road blocks, patrols, inspections and quarantines.{{sfn|Powell|1993|pp=216ff}} On September 12, Clarkson summoned fellow citizens interested in helping the Guardians of the Poor. They formed a committee to take over from the Guardians and address the crisis.<ref name=\"Committee\">''Minutes of the Proceedings of the Committee to Attend to and Alleviate the Sufferings of the Afflicted with the Malignant Fever,'' 1794.</ref>\n\nOn the 14th, Clarkson was joined by 26 men, who formed committees to reorganize the fever hospital, arrange visits to the sick, feed those unable to care for themselves, and arrange for wagons to carry the sick to the hospital and the dead to Potter's Field.<ref name=\"Committee\"/> The Committee acted quickly: after a report of 15-month-old twins being orphaned, two days later the Committee had identified a house for sheltering the growing number of orphans.<ref>{{cite web | last=Minutes | title=p. 22 | url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/6395244?n=30&printThumbnails=no |accessdate=January 31, 2012 }}</ref> As noted above, [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]] and [[Absalom Jones]] offered the services of members of the [[Free African Society]] to the Committee.<ref>Allen and Jones, ''A Narrative of the Proceedings of the Black People...,'' 1993, p. to come.</ref>\n\nWhen the Mayor's Committee inspected the Bush Hill fever hospital, they found the nurses unqualified and arrangements chaotic.<ref>{{cite web | last=Minutes | title=p. 12 | url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/6395244?n=20&printThumbnails=no |accessdate=January 31, 2012 }}</ref> \"The sick, the dying, and the dead were indiscriminately mingled together.

A barn was adapted as a place for convalescing patients. On September 17, the managers hired 9 female nurses and 10 male attendants, as well as a female matron. They assigned the 14 rooms to separate male and female patients. With the discovery of a spring on the estate, workers were organized to have clean water pumped into the hospital. Helm and Girard informed the Committee that they could accommodate more than the 60 patients then under their care, and soon the hospital had 140 patients.<ref>Minutes, pp. 17ff.</ref>\n\nGirard found that the intermittent visits by four young physicians from the city added to the confusion about patient treatment. He hired [[Jean Deveze]], a French doctor with experience treating yellow fever in [[Saint-Domingue]] (now Haiti). Deveze cared only for the patients at the hospital, and he was assisted by French apothecaries. Deveze admired Girard's fearlessness in his devotion to the patients. In a memoir published in 1794, Deveze wrote of Girard: <blockquote>I even saw one of the diseased ... [discharge] the contents of his stomach upon [him]. What did Girard do? ... He wiped the patient's cloaths, comforted [him] ... arranged the bed, [and] inspired with courage, by renewing in him the hope that he should recover. \u2014From him he went to another, that vomited offensive matter that would have disheartened any other than this wonderful man.<ref>{{cite web | last=Deveze | first=Jean | title=An Inquiry into and Observations upon the Causes and Effects of the Epidemic Disease Which Raged in Philadelphia, 1794, p. 26 | year=1794| url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/7374528?n=34&printThumbnails=no |accessdate=February 20, 2012 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nNews that patients treated at the hospital were recovering encouraged many people to believe that medicine was gaining control of the fever. But, it soon became clear that mortality at the hospital remained high; about 50% of those admitted died.{{sfn|Rush|1794|p=320}}\n\n==Reactions by other cities==\nAs the death toll in the city rose, officials in neighboring communities and major port cities such as New York and [[Baltimore]] established quarantines for refugees and goods from Philadelphia. New York established a \"Committee appointed to prevent the spreading and introduction of infectious diseases in this city\", which set up citizen patrols to monitor entry to the city. Stage coaches from Philadelphia were not allowed in many cities. [[Havre de Grace, Maryland]], for example, tried to prevent people from Philadelphia from crossing the [[Susquehanna River]] to Maryland.{{sfn|Powell|1993|pp=216ff}}{{sfn|Carey|1793|pp=47ff}} Neighboring cities did send food supplies and money; for example, New York City sent $5000 to the Mayor's Committee.<ref>Minutes, pp 36ff.</ref>\n \n[[Woodbury, New Jersey|Woodbury]] and [[Springfield, Burlington County, New Jersey|Springfield, New Jersey]]; [[Chester, Pennsylvania]] and [[Elkton, Maryland]], were among towns that accepted refugees.{{sfn|Carey|1793|pp=59ff}} President Washington corresponded with members of his cabinet on where to assemble if the epidemic prevented Congress from meeting as scheduled in December. Washington decided to hold the cabinet in early November in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]], at that time an independent town ten miles from the heart of Philadelphia.\n\n==Carey's accusations==\nIn his 1793 account of the epidemic, Mathew Carey contrasted the sacrifices of men like Joseph Inskeep, a Quaker who served on the Mayor's Committee and also visited the sick, with the selfishness of others. When Inskeep contracted the fever, he asked for the assistance of a family whom he had attended when several of its members were sick. They refused; he died, which might have happened even with their aid. Carey reported their refusal.{{sfn|Carey|1793|p=79}}\n\nHe published rumors of greed, especially by landlords who threw convalescing tenants into the street to gain control of their flats.{{sfn|Carey|1793|p=75}} While he praised [[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]] and [[Absalom Jones]] for their work,<ref name=\"Winch\">{{cite web|title=Africans in America \u2013 Part 3: Brotherly Love (1791\u20131831) \u2013 Philadelphia/Modern Voices/Julie Winch on Jones' and Allen's response to Carey |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3i3111.html |date=1998 |work=[[PBS]] |access-date=March 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308222735/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3i3111.html |archive-date=March 8, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> he suggested that blacks had caused the epidemic, and that some black nurses had charged high fees and even stolen from those for whom they cared.{{sfn|Carey|1793|p=63}}\n\nAllen and Jones quickly wrote a pamphlet to defend the people of color in the crisis. The historian Julie Winch believes they wanted to defend their community, knowing how powerful Carey was, and wanting to maintain the reputation of their people in the aftermath of the epidemic.<ref name=\"Winch\"/>  The men noted that the first nurses from the Free African Society had worked without any pay. As the mortality rate increased, they had to hire men to get anyone to deal with the sick and dying. They recounted that <blockquote>the great prices paid did not escape the observation of that worthy and vigilant magistrate, [[Matthew Clarkson]], mayor of the city, and president of the committee. He sent for us, and requested we would use our influence to lessen the wages of the nurses. But on informing him of the cause, i.e. that of the people over-bidding one another, it was concluded unnecessary to attempt any thing on that head; therefore it was left to the people concerned.</blockquote> Allen and Jones noted that white nurses also profited and stole from their patients. \"We know that six pounds was demanded by and paid to a white woman, for putting a corpse into a coffin; and forty dollars was demanded and paid to four white men, for bringing it down the stairs.\" Many black nurses served without compensation: <blockquote>\"A poor black man, named Sampson, went constantly from house to house where distress was, and no assistance, without fee or reward. He was smitten with the disorder, and died. After his death his family were neglected by those he had served. Sarah Bass, a poor black widow, gave all the assistance she could, in several families, for which she did not receive any thing; and when any thing was offered her, she left it to the option of those she served.\"{{sfn|Allen|Jones|1794|pp=9\u201311}}</blockquote>\n\n==Response of churches==\nChurch clergy continued to hold services, which helped keep up residents' morale. Rev. J. Henry C. Helmuth, who led the city's German Lutheran congregation, wrote ''A Short Account of the Yellow Fever in Philadelphia for the Reflecting Christian.'' He also left a diary. On September 16 he reported that his church was \"very full\" the day before. In one week in October, 130 members of his congregation were buried. On October 13, he wrote in his diary: <blockquote>Preached to a large gathering about Jes.26,1. I showed that Philadelphia a very blessed city\u2014the Lord is among us and especially in our congregation. I proved this with examples of dead and still living people. Baptized a child.

The meetinghouse is not far from the waterfront where the epidemic had started. In their Yearly Epistle following the meeting, the Friends wrote that to have changed the time or place of the meeting would have been a \"haughty attempt\" to escape \"the rod\" of God, from which there was no escape.<ref>\"Yearly Meeting Epistle 1793,\" Swarthmore College Library Quaker Collection; see also letter by Margaret Morris to her daughter August 31, 1793, Haverford College Library Manuscript Collection.</ref> The Quaker John Todd, who attended the meeting, contracted the fever and died of it.

At first they hoped a seasonal \"equinoctial gale,\" or hurricane, common at that time of year, would blow away the fever. Heavy rains in late September seemed to correlate with a higher rate of cases. Residents next anticipated freezing temperatures at night, which they knew were associated with ending fall fevers. By the first two weeks of October and peak of the crisis, gloom pervaded the city. Most churches had stopped holding services, and the post office moved out of the area of the highest number of cases. The market days continued, and bakers continued to make and distribute bread.<ref>''Federal Gazette,'' October 5, 1793.</ref> Several members of the Mayor's Committee died. African-American nurses had also begun dying of the fever. Carts took ill victims to Bush Hill and the dead to burial grounds. Doctors also suffered illness and death, and fewer were available to care for patients. Three of Rush's apprentices and his sister died; he was too sick to leave his house. Such news cast doubts on Rush's methods, but none of those victims had submitted to his harsh treatment.{{sfn|Rush|1794|pp=349\u2013350}}\n\nThose refugees from Saint-Domingue who thought they had immunity used the streets freely, but few other residents did. Those who had not escaped the city tried to wait out the epidemic in their homes. When the Mayor's Committee took a quick census of the dead, they found that the majority of victims were poor people, who died in homes located in the alleys, behind the main streets where most of the business of city was conducted.<ref>Minutes, pp. 51, 241ff.</ref>\n\nOn October 16, after temperatures cooled, a newspaper reported that \"the malignant fever has very considerably abated.\"<ref>''Federal Gazette,'' October 16, 1793</ref> Stores began to reopen October 25, many families returned, and the wharves were \"once more enlivened\" as a London-based ship arrived with goods.<ref>''Federal Gazette,'' October 25, 1793.</ref> The Mayor's Committee advised people outside the city to wait another week or 10 days before returning. It published directions for cleaning houses which had been closed up, recommending that they be aired for several days with all windows and doors open. \"Burning of nitre will correct the corrupt air which they may contain. Quick lime should be thrown into the privies and the chambers whitewashed.\" On the 31st, a white flag was hoisted over Bush Hill with the legend, \"No More Sick Persons Here.\"<ref>''Federal Gazette,'' November 1, 1793.</ref>\n\nBut, after some warm days, fever cases recurred. The white flag had to be struck. Finally on November 13, stagecoaches resumed service to the north and south. A merchant reported that the streets were \"in an uproar and rendered the wharves impossible by reason of the vast quantities of wine, sugar, rum, coffee, cotton & c. The porters are quite savvy and demand extravagantly for anything they do.\"<ref>Welsh papers, November 13, 1793, Historical Society of Pennsylvania.</ref> On November 14, the Mayor's Committee recommended purifying houses, clothing and bedding, but said that anyone could come to the city \"without danger from the late prevailing disorder.\"<ref>''Minutes,'' p. 120.</ref>\n\n==Lists of the dead==\nAn official register of deaths listed 4044 people as dying between August 1 and November 9, 1793 based on grave counts, so the total was probably higher. City officials, medical and religious leaders, and newspaper publishers reported the number and names of victims, based on the minutes of the Mayor's Committee. The Appendix of on-line edition of Minutes lists the names of all the patients admitted to Bush Hill hospital, as well as the disposition of their cases.<ref>Minutes, pp. 205\u2013232.</ref> The publisher Mathew Carey released his history of the epidemic just weeks after its end. He listed the names of the dead at the back of the book, which is one reason it was a bestseller.{{sfn|Carey|1793|pp=121\u2013164}} While Deveze did not reveal his patients' names in describing his treatments, Rush named his patients in his memoir.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Controversies over the epidemic==\nThe end of the epidemic did not end the controversies among the city's doctors, who disagreed about causes and treatment. Hearing rumors that colleagues were going to try to get him expelled from the College of Physicians, Rush resigned and formed a new medical society, which many of the city's younger doctors joined.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Rush's promotion of his remedies and attacks on others were strongly criticized by the medical community.\n\n===Cause===\nMerchants worried more about Rush's theory that the fever arose from the filth of Philadelphia and was not imported from the West Indies. They did not want the port's reputation to suffer permanently. Doctors used his treatments while rejecting his etiology of the disease. Others deprecated his therapies, such as Dr. Deveze, but agreed that the fever had local origins. Deveze had arrived on the refugee ship from Saint-Domingue which many accused of having carried the disease, but he thought it healthy. The doctors did not understand the origin or transmittal of the disease.<ref>{{cite web | last=Deveze | first=Jean | title=Inquiry p. 12 | url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/7374528?n=20&printThumbnails=no |accessdate=January 31, 2012 }}</ref> Historians believe it was brought by refugees from Saint-Domingue, where it was endemic, and transmitted by mosquitoes between the infected and healthy persons.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Differing courses of treatment===\nDr. Kuhn advised drinking wine, \"at first weaker wines, such as claret and Rhenish; if these cannot be had, Lisbon or Madeira diluted with rich lemonade. The quantity is to be determined by the effects it produces and by the state of debility which prevails, guarding against its occasioning or encreasing <!--this archaic spelling of the word \"increasing\" is used in the original, 18th-century source--> the heat, restlessness or delirium.\" He placed \"the greatest dependence for the cure to the disease, on throwing cool water twice a day over the naked body. The patient is to be placed in a large empty tub, and two buckets full of water, of the temperature 75 or 80 degrees Fahrenheit's thermometer, according to the state of the atmosphere, are to be thrown on him.\" The water treatment was also advocated by Dr. Edward Stevens, who in mid-September claimed it had cured [[Alexander Hamilton]], Secretary of the Treasury, of the fever.<ref>''General Advertiser,'' September 11, 1793, also in Rush, pp. 207ff</ref>\n\nRush searched the medical literature for other approaches. Benjamin Franklin had given him letters sent by Dr. John Mitchell, related to treating patients during a 1741 yellow fever outbreak in Virginia. (Franklin never published the letters.) Mitchell noted that the stomach and intestines filled with blood and that these organs had to be emptied at all costs. \"On this account,\" Mitchell argued, \"an ill-timed scrupulousness about the weakness of the body is of bad consequences in these urging circumstances.... I can affirm that I have given a purge in this case, when the pulse has been so low that it can hardly be felt, and the debility extreme, yet both one and the other have been restored by it.\"{{sfn|Rush|1794|pp=127ff}}<ref>In a manuscript of 1744, [[John Mitchell (geographer)|Dr. John Mitchell]] of Virginia detailed his observations and treatments of victims of a \"yellow fever\" epidemic in 1741\u20132; copies of the manuscript were sent to Mr. [[Cadwallader Colden]], a physician in New York, and to Dr. [[Benjamin Rush]] of Philadelphia; the manuscript was eventually printed (in large part) in 1805 and reprinted (in full) in 1814.

Since the demand for his services was so great, he had his assistants make as many of his powders in pill form as they could.\n\nOn September 10, he published a guide to treating the fever: \"Dr. Rush's Directions for Curing and Treating the Yellow Fever\", outlining a regimen of self-medication. At the first sign of symptoms, \"more especially if those symptoms be accompanied by a redness, or faint yellowness in the eyes, and dull or shooting pains about the region of the liver, take one of the powders in a little sugar and water, every six hours, until they produce four or five large evacuations from the bowels...\" He urged that the patient stay in bed and \"drink plentifully\" of barley or chicken water. Then after the \"bowels are thoroughly cleaned,\" it was proper to take 8 to 10 ounces of blood from the arm if, after purging, the pulse was full or tense. To keep the body open he recommended more calomel or small doses of cream of tarter or other salts. If the pulse was weak and low, he recommended camomile or snakeroot as a stimulant, and blisters or blankets soaked in hot vinegar wrapped around the lower limbs. To restore the patient he recommended \"gruel, sago, panada, tapioca, tea, coffee, weak chocolate, wine whey, chicken broth, and white meats, according to the weak or active state of the system; the fruits of the season may be eaten with advantage at all times.\" The sick room should be kept cool and vinegar should be sprinkled around the floor.{{sfn|Rush|1794|p=211}}\n\nRush's therapy was generalized as \"purge and bleed,\" and as long as the patient remained debilitated, Rush urged further purging and bleeding. Not a few of his patients became comatose. The calomel in his pills soon brought on a state of constant salivation, which Rush urged patients to attain to assure a cure. A characteristic sign of death was black vomit, which salivation seemed to ward off.<ref>Rush, p to come.</ref> Since he urged purging at the first sign of fever, other doctors began seeing patients who suffered severe abdominal distress.

He later discussed treatment in his memoir, which included 18 case studies and descriptions of several autopsies. While he deprecated Rush's harsh purgatives and \"heroic\" bleeding, he moderately bled patients and also used medicines to evacuate the bowels. Like Rush, he thought poisons had to be \"abstracted\" in severely debilitated patients. Instead of purges, he used blisters to raise welts on the skin.<ref>{{cite web | last=Deveze | first=Jean | title=Inquiry p 60 | url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/7374528?n=68&printThumbnails=no |accessdate=January 31, 2012 }}</ref> Unlike Kuhn, he did not favor baths.

The city suffered yellow fever epidemics in 1797, 1798, and 1799, which kept the origin and treatment controversies alive.<ref>{{cite web | last=Rush | first=Benjamin | title=Observations Upon the Origin of the Malignant Bilious, or Yellow Fever in Philadelphia, and Upon the Means of Preventing It: Addressed to the Citizens of Philadelphia | url=http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/6483213?n=3&imagesize=1200&jp2Res=.25&printThumbnails=no | accessdate=March 22, 2012 }}, Harvard University Library</ref>\n\nSome of the city's clergy suggested the epidemic was a judgment from God.<ref>\"An Earnest Call Occasioned by the Alarming Pestilential Contagion,\" November 8, 1793, Evans catalog #25427.</ref> Led by the Quakers, the religious community petitioned the state legislature to prohibit theatrical presentations in the state.

Other major ports also had epidemics, beginning with Baltimore in 1794, New York in 1795 and 1798, and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] in 1798, making yellow fever a national crisis. New York doctors finally admitted that they had had an outbreak of yellow fever in 1791 that killed more than 100 people. All the cities that suffered epidemics continued to grow rapidly. The widespread recognition that the epidemics were based along the waterfront meant that cities grew more rapidly in outlying areas, but that was also where land was available at lower cost. Families who could afford it planned to vacate the port cities during the sick season.\n\nDuring the epidemic of 1798, Benjamin Rush commuted daily from a house just outside the city, near what is now 15th and Columbia Streets, to the new city fever hospital, where as chief doctor he treated fever victims.<ref>Butterfield, p. 803.</ref>  The civic responses to the 1798 epidemics in Philadelphia and New York were more complex than the efforts of the 1793 Mayor's Committee. For instance, Philadelphia forced evacuation of certain neighborhoods and placed refugees in supervised camps. After the epidemic, the city inspected all houses and destroyed those it deemed unhealthy.\n\nAmerican doctors did not identify the vector of yellow fever until the late nineteenth century. In 1881 [[Carlos Finlay]], a Cuban doctor, argued that mosquito bites caused yellow fever; he credited Rush's published account of the 1793 epidemic for giving him the idea. He said that Rush had written: \"Mosquitoes (the usual attendants of a sickly autumn) were uncommonly numerous...\"{{sfn|Rush|1794|p=108}} In the late 1880s, Finlay's theories were confirmed in Cuba by experiments of the US Medical Army Corps under direction of Dr. [[Walter Reed]] in the late 1880s, in which subjects allowed themselves to be bitten by infected mosquitoes.\n\nIn the first week of September 1793, Dr. William Currie published a description of the epidemic and an account of its progress during August. The publisher Mathew Carey had an account of the epidemic for sale in the third week of October, before the epidemic had ended.<ref name=\"Carey\">{{cite web|title=Africans in America \u2013 Part 3: Brotherly Love (1791\u20131831) \u2013 Philadelphia/Historical Documents/A Short Account of the Malignant Fever... |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3h460.html |date=1998 |work=[[PBS]] |access-date=March 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321235146/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3h460.html |archive-date=March 21, 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> He accused blacks of causing the epidemic and black nurses of overcharging patients and taking advantage of them.

Dr. Benjamin Rush published an account more than 300 pages long. Two French doctors, Jean Deveze and Nassy, published shorter accounts. Clergymen also published accounts; the most notable was by the Lutheran minister J. Henry C. Helmuth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bobarnebeck.com/helmuth.html|title=Rev. Helmuth's Diary|website=bobarnebeck.com|access-date=2019-03-18}}</ref> In March 1794, the Mayor's Committee published its minutes. (Letters written during the epidemic, which in some cases expressed the last sentiments of victims, were preserved by many families and have been a source for scholars in various archives.){{citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nThe rapid succession of other yellow fever epidemics in Philadelphia and elsewhere in the northeastern United States engendered many accounts of the efforts to contain, control and cope with the disease. Rush wrote accounts of the 1797, 1798, and 1799 epidemics in Philadelphia. He revised his account of the 1793 epidemic to eliminate reference to the disease being contagious. He varied his cures. In 1798 he was appointed as the chief doctor at the fever hospital. The mortality rate that year was roughly the same as it had been at Bush Hill in 1793, despite radical difference between the therapies used.\n\n[[Noah Webster]], then a notable New York newspaper publisher, joined two doctors in publishing the ''Medical Repository,'' a magazine that collected accounts of fever epidemics throughout the nation. Webster used this data in his 1798 book, suggesting that the nation was being subjected to a widespread \"epidemic constitution\" in the atmosphere that might last 50 years and make deadly epidemics almost certain.<ref>Webster, Noah, ''A Brief History of Epidemic Disease,'' 1798.</ref> Yellow fever epidemics became seen as a national crisis. When in 1855 a French doctor published an 813-page history of yellow fever in Philadelphia, covering outbreaks from 1699 to 1854, he devoted only a few pages to the 1793 epidemic.<ref>LaRoche, ''Yellow Fever, considered in its historical, pathological, etiological, and therapeutic relations,'' 1855</ref>\n\nGeneral 20th-century US histories, such as the 10-volume ''Great Epochs in American History,'' published in 1912, used short excerpts from Carey's account.<ref>Halsey, Francis W., ''Great Epochs in American History,'' volume 4, 1912, pp 83\u201389</ref> The first history of the epidemic to draw on more primary sources was J.

Since the mid-twentieth century, scholars have studied aspects of the epidemic, first in papers. For example, Martin Pernick's \"Politics, Parties, and Pestilence: Epidemic Yellow Fever in Philadelphia and the Rise of the First Party System,\" developed statistical evidence to show that Republican doctors generally used Rush's therapies and Federalist doctors used Kuhn's.<ref>Pernick, Martin S. \"Politics, Parties, and Pestilence: Epidemic Yellow Fever in Philadelphia and the Rise of the First Party System,\" ''William and Mary Quarterly,'' 1972, pp 559\u2013586.</ref>\n\nScholars celebrated the 200th anniversary of the epidemic with the publication of papers on various aspects of the epidemic.<ref>Estes, J.

It recounts the adventures of an eponymous [[Russia]]n soldier, who passes between the world of the living, [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]], on a quest for [[immortality]]. In the beginning of the story, God rewards Ivan's charitable nature with a pouch with which he can trap all things in existence, and used by the soldier to subdue [[Satan]] and the [[Christian teaching about the Devil|multitude of devils]], and eventually serve his purpose of [[cheating Death]]. The text also includes a portrayal of [[Saint Peter]] as the gatekeeper of Heaven, a reference to the miraculous powers of [[Saint Nicholas]], as well as humorous references to the lifestyle of local aristocrats, or [[boyar]]s. The protagonist himself is shown to be devoted and intelligent, but is primarily motivated by partying and drinking, activities which he engages in for eternity.\n\nOne of Creang\u0103's celebrated contributions to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], \"Ivan Turbinc\u0103\" has become a familiar point of reference for the reading public and critics in both Romania and [[Moldova]]. It has notably inspired a short story by Moldovan author [[Vlad Iovi\u0163\u0103]] and the 1967 [[Cinema of Moldova|Moldovan film]] ''[[Se caut\u0103 un paznic]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n===Early adventures===\nThe \"Ivan Turbinc\u0103\" story<ref>Based on [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Ivan_Turbinc%C4%83 \"Ivan Turbinc\u0103\"] ([[Wikisource]])</ref> opens with a brief overview of the protagonist's life in the [[Military history of the Russian Empire|Imperial Russian Army]], which had been his home from childhood. Having survived over the age limit, Ivan is given his weapons and two [[Russian ruble|rubles]], and released from service. While traveling down a country road, he ends up walking behind God and Saint Peter, who are visiting the world of humans incognito. When Saint Peter expresses alarm at the sight of a soldier who might be prone to mistreating civilians, God informs him that Ivan is a kind man of outstanding generosity, and urges Peter to test that himself. They transform themselves into beggars, and wait at each end of a bridge for Ivan to pass through. The soldier proceeds to give them both of his rubles, stating that \"God will again render onto me, for there's more of his to give.\" As Ivan leaves the scene, the moved Peter urges his divine companion to reward the soldier. They both catch up with him, whereupon God reveals himself and lets the astonished Ivan have his money back. The soldier kneels and prays God to bless his army issue pouch (''turbinc\u0103''), \"so that I may be able to pack inside of it anybody I may wish; and so that they could never get out without my approval.\" The amused God grants him this wish, and, before leaving, informs Ivan that, should he ever feel tired of roaming the land, he'll be welcomed to knock on the gate of Heaven.\n\nThe old soldier continues his aimless travel, determined to put his pouch to the test. That evening, he reaches the house of a boyar, and, profiting from his \"Imperial man\" status, demands and receives lodging. The reluctant and stingy boyar decides to trick the unwelcome guest by making him sleep inside the only one of his houses where devils are supposed to be roaming. The soldier falls asleep on a [[Divan (furniture)|divan]], only to be rudely awakened when his pillow is thrown away by invisible hands, and again when the entire room is animated by loud, [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] sounds. Ivan puts a stop to this when he yells ''Pa\u0219ol na turbinca!'' (an approximate [[Romanian language|Romanian]] rendition of the [[Russian language|Russian]] for \"Get into the pouch!\"), and all devils throughout the boyar's house are absorbed into his small container. He falls back to sleep, but is again woken up by Satan himself (referred to with the popular etymology ''Scaraoschi''), who is infuriated by the loss of his servants, and slaps the soldier over the face. Ivan is much annoyed by this, and promptly orders his aggressor into the pouch, with the other devils. At daybreak, Ivan takes his revenge on the boyar by awaking his entire household, and claiming that he has spent the night trapping rabbits in his bag, and asks the host to provide him with ramrods so that he may peel the skin off the animals. The boyar, understanding of what Ivan means, hands him \"a cartload\" of sticks, whereupon the protagonist drags the devils out one by one and gives each of them a severe beating, making them promise never to return. The emotional boyar embraces the rescuer of his property and offers him permanent lodging, but Ivan declines, stating that his task is to defend God, \"every man's emperor\". As he leaves the premises, the narrator notes: \"It seems to me that the boyar himself [...] had come to fear the pouch, so he did not feel too sorry at seeing Ivan leave\".\n\n===Cheating Death===\n[[File:Edinorodniy syn detail.jpg|thumb|270px|Depiction of Death in an 18th-century [[Russian icons|Russian icon]]]]\nBack on the road, Ivan states his new purpose, that of finding out where God dwells, and invokes the help of [[Saint Nicholas]]. Immediately after kissing an icon of the saint, he finds himself transported to the gate of Heaven. He repeatedly bangs on it, until Saint Peter, the gatekeeper, asks him to state his name and purpose. Still on the other side of the door, Ivan inquires about the essentials of Heaven, being informed that the place does not hold tobacco, [[vodka]], women or ''[[l\u0103utari]]'', but that he will find all of these in Hell. He rushes there, and has a similar conversation with one of the devils, whose report is to Ivan's satisfaction. Once the gate is opened, the devils find themselves perplexed and, recalling their earlier encounter with the soldier, decide to service him and tolerate his whims. They are left despondent by their new master's drunken partying and exploitative demands, until the creature known as ''Talpa iadului'' (\"The Foundation of Hell\"), portrayed as the cleverest demon, promises to overturn the situation: she creates a drum, and bangs on it the rhythm of [[March (music)|march]], tricking the inebriated soldier into believing that war has started. He takes hold of his belongings and rushes out of Hell, leaving the devils to lock the gate behind him. \n\nIvan then falls back on his original plan of serving God, and returns to the entrance of Heaven, which he obstinately guards for days on end. He is there as a self-appointed guard when Death herself attempts to report back to God for instructions, and, as she insists on getting past him, traps her in the pouch. Leaving the item to hang on a tree, the soldier again bangs on the door, and is allowed inside Heaven for an audience with God. He proceeds to inform divinity that Death is at the gate, but without specifying that she is his prisoner, and asks what orders he should relay. Amused by Ivan's behavior, God asks him to tell the visitor that, for the following three years, she should only kidnap the old folk \"such as yourself\". The soldier returns, releases his prisoners, and tweaks the original order to say that Death must roam the forests and consume the old trees within the space of three years. This she does and, when the term expires and she runs back to Heaven, she is shocked to find the soldier is still by the gate. A heated exchange follows, at the end of which Ivan sends Death back into the pouch and leaves for another audience with God. The latter, the narrator informs, is aware of Ivan's ruse, but decides to play along: he lets his guest know that he should tell Death to capture the young for three years, and then misbehaved children for another three. Ivan again misinterprets the command, forcing Death to eat first young trees, then twigs, for a total of six years. Once her ordeal is over, she is back at Heaven's entrance, and again in front of Ivan. He again traps her, telling her that this is revenge for people she has killed \"since [[Adam]]\", and informing her that she will no longer be allowed out of the bag.\n\nThe episode is interrupted by God, who lets Ivan know that he should hand in his pouch and prepare for his own timely death, leaving him three days to prepare. The man uses this interval to reflect on his adventures and fashion himself a coffin. When newly released Death returns to him, Ivan claims not to be aware of how people are supposed to be laid to rest. He exasperates his adversary by dropping himself into the coffin every which way but the proper one, until she decides to teach him by personal example. Once Death is on her back, eyes closed and hands crossed on her chest, Ivan seals the coffin lid and traps her inside. God again intervenes, and is shown to be upset about the soldier's tricks: while he resigns in front of Ivan's determination to live, he punishes him to spend eternity as an old man. The story ends with the indication that Ivan went on to party for ever, boozing and attending a succession of ''guleaiuri'' (banquets or wedding parties), and that \"he may still be alive now, if he did not die in the meantime.\"\n\n==Critical reception and legacy==\nIon Creang\u0103's version of the story probably incorporates an old theme in [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]] and is believed to be an echo of themes shared by several \n[[European folklore|European traditions]].

It recounts the adventures of an eponymous [[Russia]]n soldier, who passes between the world of the living, [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]], on a quest for [[immortality]]. In the beginning of the story, God rewards Ivan's charitable nature with a pouch with which he can trap all things in existence, and used by the soldier to subdue [[Satan]] and the [[Christian teaching about the Devil|multitude of devils]], and eventually serve his purpose of [[cheating Death]]. The text also includes a portrayal of [[Saint Peter]] as the gatekeeper of Heaven, a reference to the miraculous powers of [[Saint Nicholas]], as well as humorous references to the lifestyle of local aristocrats, or [[boyar]]s. The protagonist himself is shown to be devoted and intelligent, but is primarily motivated by partying and drinking, activities which he engages in for eternity.\n\nOne of Creang\u0103's celebrated contributions to [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]], \"Ivan Turbinc\u0103\" has become a familiar point of reference for the reading public and critics in both Romania and [[Moldova]]. It has notably inspired a short story by Moldovan author [[Vlad Iovi\u0163\u0103]] and the 1967 [[Cinema of Moldova|Moldovan film]] ''[[Se caut\u0103 un paznic]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n===Early adventures===\nThe \"Ivan Turbinc\u0103\" story<ref>Based on [http://ro.wikisource.org/wiki/Ivan_Turbinc%C4%83 \"Ivan Turbinc\u0103\"] ([[Wikisource]])</ref> opens with a brief overview of the protagonist's life in the [[Military history of the Russian Empire|Imperial Russian Army]], which had been his home from childhood. Having survived over the age limit, Ivan is given his weapons and two [[Russian ruble|rubles]], and released from service. While traveling down a country road, he ends up walking behind God and Saint Peter, who are visiting the world of humans incognito. When Saint Peter expresses alarm at the sight of a soldier who might be prone to mistreating civilians, God informs him that Ivan is a kind man of outstanding generosity, and urges Peter to test that himself. They transform themselves into beggars, and wait at each end of a bridge for Ivan to pass through. The soldier proceeds to give them both of his rubles, stating that \"God will again render onto me, for there's more of his to give.\" As Ivan leaves the scene, the moved Peter urges his divine companion to reward the soldier. They both catch up with him, whereupon God reveals himself and lets the astonished Ivan have his money back. The soldier kneels and prays God to bless his army issue pouch (''turbinc\u0103''), \"so that I may be able to pack inside of it anybody I may wish; and so that they could never get out without my approval.\" The amused God grants him this wish, and, before leaving, informs Ivan that, should he ever feel tired of roaming the land, he'll be welcomed to knock on the gate of Heaven.\n\nThe old soldier continues his aimless travel, determined to put his pouch to the test. That evening, he reaches the house of a boyar, and, profiting from his \"Imperial man\" status, demands and receives lodging. The reluctant and stingy boyar decides to trick the unwelcome guest by making him sleep inside the only one of his houses where devils are supposed to be roaming. The soldier falls asleep on a [[Divan (furniture)|divan]], only to be rudely awakened when his pillow is thrown away by invisible hands, and again when the entire room is animated by loud, [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoeic]] sounds. Ivan puts a stop to this when he yells ''Pa\u0219ol na turbinca!'' (an approximate [[Romanian language|Romanian]] rendition of the [[Russian language|Russian]] for \"Get into the pouch!\"), and all devils throughout the boyar's house are absorbed into his small container. He falls back to sleep, but is again woken up by Satan himself (referred to with the popular etymology ''Scaraoschi''), who is infuriated by the loss of his servants, and slaps the soldier over the face. Ivan is much annoyed by this, and promptly orders his aggressor into the pouch, with the other devils. At daybreak, Ivan takes his revenge on the boyar by awaking his entire household, and claiming that he has spent the night trapping rabbits in his bag, and asks the host to provide him with ramrods so that he may peel the skin off the animals. The boyar, understanding of what Ivan means, hands him \"a cartload\" of sticks, whereupon the protagonist drags the devils out one by one and gives each of them a severe beating, making them promise never to return. The emotional boyar embraces the rescuer of his property and offers him permanent lodging, but Ivan declines, stating that his task is to defend God, \"every man's emperor\". As he leaves the premises, the narrator notes: \"It seems to me that the boyar himself [...] had come to fear the pouch, so he did not feel too sorry at seeing Ivan leave\".\n\n===Cheating Death===\n[[File:Edinorodniy syn detail.jpg|thumb|270px|Depiction of Death in an 18th-century [[Russian icons|Russian icon]]]]\nBack on the road, Ivan states his new purpose, that of finding out where God dwells, and invokes the help of [[Saint Nicholas]]. Immediately after kissing an icon of the saint, he finds himself transported to the gate of Heaven. He repeatedly bangs on it, until Saint Peter, the gatekeeper, asks him to state his name and purpose. Still on the other side of the door, Ivan inquires about the essentials of Heaven, being informed that the place does not hold tobacco, [[vodka]], women or ''[[l\u0103utari]]'', but that he will find all of these in Hell. He rushes there, and has a similar conversation with one of the devils, whose report is to Ivan's satisfaction. Once the gate is opened, the devils find themselves perplexed and, recalling their earlier encounter with the soldier, decide to service him and tolerate his whims. They are left despondent by their new master's drunken partying and exploitative demands, until the creature known as ''Talpa iadului'' (\"The Foundation of Hell\"), portrayed as the cleverest demon, promises to overturn the situation: she creates a drum, and bangs on it the rhythm of [[March (music)|march]], tricking the inebriated soldier into believing that war has started. He takes hold of his belongings and rushes out of Hell, leaving the devils to lock the gate behind him. \n\nIvan then falls back on his original plan of serving God, and returns to the entrance of Heaven, which he obstinately guards for days on end. He is there as a self-appointed guard when Death herself attempts to report back to God for instructions, and, as she insists on getting past him, traps her in the pouch. Leaving the item to hang on a tree, the soldier again bangs on the door, and is allowed inside Heaven for an audience with God. He proceeds to inform divinity that Death is at the gate, but without specifying that she is his prisoner, and asks what orders he should relay. Amused by Ivan's behavior, God asks him to tell the visitor that, for the following three years, she should only kidnap the old folk \"such as yourself\". The soldier returns, releases his prisoners, and tweaks the original order to say that Death must roam the forests and consume the old trees within the space of three years. This she does and, when the term expires and she runs back to Heaven, she is shocked to find the soldier is still by the gate. A heated exchange follows, at the end of which Ivan sends Death back into the pouch and leaves for another audience with God. The latter, the narrator informs, is aware of Ivan's ruse, but decides to play along: he lets his guest know that he should tell Death to capture the young for three years, and then misbehaved children for another three. Ivan again misinterprets the command, forcing Death to eat first young trees, then twigs, for a total of six years. Once her ordeal is over, she is back at Heaven's entrance, and again in front of Ivan. He again traps her, telling her that this is revenge for people she has killed \"since [[Adam]]\", and informing her that she will no longer be allowed out of the bag.\n\nThe episode is interrupted by God, who lets Ivan know that he should hand in his pouch and prepare for his own timely death, leaving him three days to prepare. The man uses this interval to reflect on his adventures and fashion himself a coffin. When newly released Death returns to him, Ivan claims not to be aware of how people are supposed to be laid to rest. He exasperates his adversary by dropping himself into the coffin every which way but the proper one, until she decides to teach him by personal example. Once Death is on her back, eyes closed and hands crossed on her chest, Ivan seals the coffin lid and traps her inside. God again intervenes, and is shown to be upset about the soldier's tricks: while he resigns in front of Ivan's determination to live, he punishes him to spend eternity as an old man. The story ends with the indication that Ivan went on to party for ever, boozing and attending a succession of ''guleaiuri'' (banquets or wedding parties), and that \"he may still be alive now, if he did not die in the meantime.\"\n\n==Critical reception and legacy==\nIon Creang\u0103's version of the story probably incorporates an old theme in [[Folklore of Romania|Romanian folklore]] and is believed to be an echo of themes shared by several \n[[European folklore|European traditions]].
