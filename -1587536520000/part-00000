Partners at HHM include Jimmy's nemesis [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) and his brother [[Chuck McGill]] ([[Michael McKean]]). Ehrmantraut conducts illegal drug distribution with [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), in addition to becoming right-hand man for drug lord [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) who runs a chain of fast food restaurants as a business front. Their operations are disrupted by members of the Salamanca crime family, including [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]). Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito all reprise their roles from ''Breaking Bad''.\n\n''Better Call Saul'' has received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its acting, characters, and cinematography; many critics have called it a worthy successor to ''Breaking Bad'' and one of the best prequels ever made, with some deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"sallgoodman\">{{cite web |last1=Heritage |first1=Stuart |title='S'all good, man': How Better Call Saul became superior to Breaking Bad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/11/sall-good-man-how-better-call-saul-became-superior-to-breaking-bad |website=The Guardian |date=October 11, 2018 |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Stephen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/20/better-call-saul-breaking-bad-vince-gilligan |title=The perfect prequel: how Better Call Saul left Breaking Bad in its dust |work=The Guardian |date=June 20, 2017 |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Turner |first=Julia |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/04/18/better_call_saul_is_better_than_breaking_bad.html |title=Better Call Saul Is Better Than Breaking Bad |work=Slate |date=April 18, 2016 |accessdate=September 25, 2018}}</ref> It has garnered many nominations, including a [[Peabody Award]], 23 [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], eleven [[Writers Guild of America Awards]], five [[Critics' Choice Television Awards]], a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s.

This includes the uneasy truce between the Salamanca family that serves the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]] drug interest and later led by [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]) when their patriarch falls ill, and [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]), a restaurant entrepreneur that uses his stores as a front for the drug trade.

Gould]], and a prequel and spin-off of Gilligan's prior series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. Set in the early to mid [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], the series follows the story of con-man turned small-time lawyer Jimmy McGill ([[Bob Odenkirk]]), beginning six years before the events of ''Breaking Bad'' and showing his transformation into the persona of criminal for hire [[Saul Goodman]]. McGill becomes the lawyer for former police officer [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), whose skills allow him to enter the criminal underworld of drug trafficking in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. The show premiered on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] on February 8, 2015, airing five seasons to date. A sixth and final season is scheduled to air in 2021.<ref>{{cite web |last=Thorne |first=Will |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/better-call-saul-renewed-final-season-1203470181/ |title='Better Call Saul' Renewed for 6th and Final Season at AMC |work=Variety |date=January 16, 2020 |accessdate=January 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nMcGill is initially working as a low-paid lawyer with the back room of a nail salon as his home and office. His friend and romantic interest [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]) works as a lawyer at the firm of Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), where she and Jimmy once worked in the mailroom. Partners at HHM include Jimmy's nemesis [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) and his brother [[Chuck McGill]] ([[Michael McKean]]). Ehrmantraut conducts illegal drug distribution with [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), in addition to becoming right-hand man for drug lord [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) who runs a chain of fast food restaurants as a business front. Their operations are disrupted by members of the Salamanca crime family, including [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]). Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito all reprise their roles from ''Breaking Bad''.\n\n''Better Call Saul'' has received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its acting, characters, and cinematography; many critics have called it a worthy successor to ''Breaking Bad'' and one of the best prequels ever made, with some deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"sallgoodman\">{{cite web |last1=Heritage |first1=Stuart |title='S'all good, man': How Better Call Saul became superior to Breaking Bad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/11/sall-good-man-how-better-call-saul-became-superior-to-breaking-bad |website=The Guardian |date=October 11, 2018 |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Stephen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/20/better-call-saul-breaking-bad-vince-gilligan |title=The perfect prequel: how Better Call Saul left Breaking Bad in its dust |work=The Guardian |date=June 20, 2017 |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Turner |first=Julia |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/04/18/better_call_saul_is_better_than_breaking_bad.html |title=Better Call Saul Is Better Than Breaking Bad |work=Slate |date=April 18, 2016 |accessdate=September 25, 2018}}</ref> It has garnered many nominations, including a [[Peabody Award]], 23 [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], eleven [[Writers Guild of America Awards]], five [[Critics' Choice Television Awards]], a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s.

Mike escorts engineers who evaluate the laundry's potential as a meth lab and Gus hires Werner to oversee construction. Hector recovers mentally and can move his right index finger.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague Terentiy Maltsev, who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nSince 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] had began to report excessive production of grains. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961.

On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that \"in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion ''[[Chinese units of measurement|jin]]'' of grain,\" when they actually contained 12.7 billion ''jin.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|author2=Felix Wemheuer|author3=Gao Hua|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=177|chapter=Food Augmentation Methods and Food Substitutes during the Great Famine}}</ref> The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, policies from the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and the central government that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the aggrevating famine. The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the [[Mass line|Mass Line]], one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in various ways, including causing the \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\".

By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi.

Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating

Nevertheless, [[Frank Dik\u00f6tter]] argues that most floods during the famine were not due to unusual weather, but to massive, poorly planned and poorly executed irrigation works which were part of

agricultural performance. They also suspected that local officials tended to exaggerate such reports to obtain more state assistance or tax relief. Clearly, the weather contributed to the appalling drop in output, but it is impossible to assess to what extent. </blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath ==\n\n=== Initial cover-ups ===\nLocal party leaders, for their part, conspired to cover up shortfalls and reassign blame in order to protect their own lives and positions.{{citation needed|reason=They did cover up shortfalls and invent numbers, but the second part of this needs a citation.|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn visits to [[Henan province]] in 1958, Mao observed what local officials claimed was increases in crop yield of one thousand to three thousand percent achieved, supposedly, in massive 24-hour pushes organized by the officials which they called \"sputnik launches\".  But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|title=Mao's Great Famine|last=International School History|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=19 September 2018|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030033514/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|archive-date=30 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>[http://www.disasterhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Standing-on-Grain-Propaganda-1959.jpg Aforementioned propaganda photo. ]\n\n=== Reflections ===\nIn April and May 1961, [[Liu Shaoqi]], then [[President of the People's Republic of China]], concluded after 44 days of field research in villages of [[Hunan]] that the reasons for the famine were 30% natural disaster and 70% human error.<ref name=\":4\">[http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html \u5218\u5c11\u5947\"\u4e09\u5206\u5929\u707e\uff0c\u4e03\u5206\u4eba\u7978\"\u63d0\u6cd5\u7684\u7531\u6765] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214040606/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html |date=14 December 2012 }}, Selection of the Party History (\u515a\u53f2\u535a\u91c7), 22 June 2007, Accessed Sept 1, 2018, CPC News. {{in lang|zh-Hans}}</ref><ref name=\":5\" /> Until the early 1980s, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]'s stance, reflected by the name \"Three Years of Natural Disasters\", was that the famine was largely a result of a series of natural disasters compounded by several planning errors. \n\nResearchers outside China argued that massive institutional and policy changes that accompanied the Great Leap Forward were the key factors in the famine, or at least worsened nature-induced disasters.<ref>{{cite video|title=China: A Century of Revolution|date=1997|people=Sue Williams (director), Howard Sharp (editor), [[Will Lyman]] (narrator)|publisher=WinStar Home Entertainment}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Population|volume=1|pages=388\u2013390|year=2003|editor-last=Demeny|editor-first=Paul|contribution=Famine in China|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan Reference|editor2-last=McNicoll|editor2-first=Geoffrey}}</ref> In particular, Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]] puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of democracy is the major culprit: \"Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country\u2014no matter how poor.\" He adds that it is \"hard to imagine that anything like this could have happened in a country that goes to the polls regularly and that has an independent press.

Millions of peasants were ordered away from agricultural work to join the iron and steel production workforce.\n\nIn 2008, [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]] would summarize the effect of the focus on production targets :\n<blockquote>In [[Xinyang]], people starved at the doors of the grain warehouses. As they died, they shouted, \"Communist Party, Chairman Mao, save us\". If the granaries of [[Henan]] and [[Hebei]] had been opened, no one need have died.

The theory was that plants of the same species would not compete with each other. In natural cycles they did fully compete, which actually stunted growth and resulted in lower yields.\n\nAnother implemented policy (known as \"[[deep plowing]]\") was based on the ideas of Lysenko's colleague [[Terentiy Maltsev]], who encouraged peasants across China to eschew normal [[plowing]] depths of 15\u201320 centimeters and instead plow extremely deeply into the soil (1 to 2 meters). The deep plowing theory stated that the most fertile soil was deep in the earth, and plowing unusually deep would allow extra strong root growth. However, in shallow soil, useless rocks, soil, and sand were driven up instead, burying the fertile topsoil and severely stunting seedling growth.\n\n==== Four Pest Campaign ====\n{{Main Article|Four Pests Campaign}}\n[[File:Tree-Sparrow-2009-16-02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Eurasian tree sparrow]] was the most notable target of the [[Four Pests Campaign]]]]\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Four Pests Campaign]], citizens were called upon to destroy sparrows and other wild birds that ate crop seeds, in order to protect fields. Pest birds were shot down or scared away from landing until dropping in exhaustion. This system failed and resulted in an explosion of the vermin population, especially crop-eating insects, which consequently had no predators.\n\n==== Illusion of superabundance ====\nSince 1957, the [[Communist Party of China]] had began to report excessive production of grains. However, the actual production of grains throughout China was decreasing from 1957\u20131961. For examples,  \n\n* In [[Sichuan Province]], even though the collected grain was decreasing from 1958\u20131961, the numbers reported to the central government kept increasing.<ref name=\"Jisheng2012\">{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=240}}</ref>\n* In [[Gansu]], the grain yield declined by 4,273,000 [[Tonne|tonnes]] from 1957 to 1961.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=126}}</ref>\n\nThis series of events resulted in an \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\", and the Party believed that they had an excess amount of grains. On the contrary, the crop yields were in fact lower than average. For instance, Beijing believed that \"in 1960 state granaries would have 50 billion ''[[Chinese units of measurement|jin]]'' of grain,\" when they actually contained 12.7 billion ''jin.''<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|author2=Felix Wemheuer|author3=Gao Hua|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=177|chapter=Food Augmentation Methods and Food Substitutes during the Great Famine}}</ref> The effects of the illusion of superabundance were significant, leaving some historians to argue that it being the major cause of much of the starvation throughout China. Yang Dali states that there were three main consequences from the illusion of superabundance:<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L. Yang|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VmLuoAkMKrkC|title=Calamity and Reform in China: State, Rural Society, and Institutional Change Since the Great Leap Famine|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1996|isbn=978-0-8047-3470-7|page=65}}</ref> <blockquote>First, it led to planners to shift lands from grain to economic crops, such as cotton, sugarcane, and beets, and divert huge numbers agricultural laborers into industrial sectors, fueling state demand for procured grain from the countryside. Second, it prompted the Chinese leadership, especially [[Zhou Enlai]], to speed up grain exports to secure more foreign currency to purchase capital goods needed for industrialization. Finally, the illusion of superabundance made the adoption of the commune mess halls seem rational at the time. All these changes, of course, contributed to the rapid exhaustion of grain supplies.</blockquote>\n\n=== More policies from the central government ===\nEconomists Xin Meng, [[Nancy Qian]] and Pierre Yared showed that, much like Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]]'s earlier claims, aggregate production was sufficient for avoiding famine and that the famine was caused by over-procurement and poor distribution within the country. They show that unlike most other famines, there was surprisingly more deaths in places that produced more food per capita and argue that the inflexibility in the centrally planned food procurement system explains at least half of the famine mortality.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meng|first=Xin|last2=Qian|first2=Nancy|last3=Yared|first3=Pierre|date=2015-10-01|title=The Institutional Causes of China's Great Famine, 1959\u20131961|url=https://academic.oup.com/restud/article/82/4/1568/2607347|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=82|issue=4|pages=1568\u20131611|doi=10.1093/restud/rdv016|issn=0034-6527}}</ref> Economic historians James Kung and Shuo Chen show that there was more over procurement in places where politicians faced more competition.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kung|first=James Kai-Sing|last2=Chen|first2=Shuo|date=February 2011|title=The Tragedy of the Nomenklatura: Career Incentives and Political Radicalism during China's Great Leap Famine|journal=American Political Science Review|volume=105|issue=1|pages=27\u201345|doi=10.1017/S0003055410000626|issn=1537-5943}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, policies from the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) and the central government that were implemented, particularly the [[Three Red Banners]] and the [[Socialist Education Movement]] (SEM), proved to be ideologically detrimental to the aggrevating famine. The Three Red Banners of the CCP \"sparked the fanaticism of 1958\"  and the implementation of the [[Mass line|Mass Line]], one of the three banners which told people to, \"go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, better, and more economical results\" directly links to the pressures officials felt when reporting a superabundance of grain.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yang Jisheng|title=Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958\u20131962|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nadqrYU10eMC|date=30 October 2012|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-27793-2|page=87}}</ref> The SEM, established in 1957, also led to the severity of the famine in various ways, including causing the \"illusion of superabundance (\u6d6e\u5938\u98ce)\".

As the Great Leap Forward progressed, many provincial leaders began to extend their reach by working closely with Mao and higher Party leaders; which, in turn resulted in these provincial leaders abusing power that they did not actually have.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dali L.

This hatred led to peasants becoming unable to openly speak on collectivization and state grain purchase. By enforcing such passivity at a local level while there already was passivity at an official level, speaking and acting against the famine became a seemingly impossible task.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|page=110|chapter=\"The Grain Problem is an Ideological Problem\" : Discourses of Hunger in the 1957 Socialist Education Campaign}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of local government in the famine can be seen in the comparison between the provinces of Anhui and Jiangxi. Anhui, having a radical pro-Mao government, was led by [[Zeng Xisheng]] who was \"dictatorial\" with ties to Mao.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=212\u2013213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref> Zeng firmly believed in the Great Leap Forward and tried to hold relationships with higher officials rather than keep close local ties. Zeng proposed agricultural projects without consulting colleagues which caused Anhui's agriculture to fail terribly.  Zhang Kaifan, a party secretary and deputy-governor of the province, heard rumours of a famine breaking out in Anhui and disagreed with many of Zeng's policies. Zeng reported Zhang to Mao for such speculations which led Mao to label Zhang \"a member of the 'Peng Dehuai anti-Party military clique,'\" resulting in him being purged from the local party. Zeng was unable to report of the famine when it became an emergency situation as this would prove his hypocrisy and caused him to become a \"blatant political radical who almost single-handedly damaged Anhui.\"<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating Bitterness: New Perspectives on China's Great Leap Forward and Famine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aHPTn2Rq9IUC|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5955-4|pages=213|chapter=Under the Same Maoist Sky : Accounting for Death Rate Discrepancies in Anhui and Jiangxi}}</ref>\n\nJiangxi encountered a situation almost opposite to that of Anhui. The leaders of Jiangxi publicly opposed some of the Great Leap programs, quietly made themselves unavailable, and even appeared to take a passive attitude towards the Maoist economy. As the leaders worked collaboratively among themselves, they also worked with the local population as well. By being able to create an environment in which the Great Leap Forward did not become fully implemented, the Jiangxi government \"did their best to minimize damage\u2026\" These findings concluded that much of the severity of the famine came down to provincial leaders and their responsibility for their regions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Kimberley Ens Manning|author2=Felix Wemheuer|title=Eating

 According to [[Yang Jisheng (journalist)|Yang Jisheng]] who was a senior journalist from [[Xinhua News Agency]], [[Xue Muqiao]], then head of the [[National Bureau of Statistics of China|National Statistics Bureau of China]], said in 1958 that \u201cwe give whatever figures the upper-level wants\u201d to overstate natural disasters and relieve official responsibility for deaths due to starvation.<ref name=\":7\" /> Yang claimed that he investigated other sources including a non-government archive of meteorological data from 350 weather stations across China, the weather from 1958-1961 was normal in China, meaning that there were no big areas of drought, flood, or low temperatures.<ref name=\":7\" /> Western scholars have also pointed out that:<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite

agricultural performance. They also suspected that local officials tended to exaggerate such reports to obtain more state assistance or tax relief. Clearly, the weather contributed to the appalling drop in output, but it is impossible to assess to what extent. </blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath ==\n\n=== Initial cover-ups ===\nLocal party leaders, for their part, conspired to cover up shortfalls and reassign blame in order to protect their own lives and positions.{{citation needed|reason=They did cover up shortfalls and invent numbers, but the second part of this needs a citation.|date=January 2018}}\n\nIn visits to [[Henan province]] in 1958, Mao observed what local officials claimed was increases in crop yield of one thousand to three thousand percent achieved, supposedly, in massive 24-hour pushes organized by the officials which they called \"sputnik launches\".  But the numbers were faked, and so were the fields that Mao observed, which had been carefully prepared in advance of Mao's visit by local officials, who removed shoots of grain from various fields and carefully transplanted them into a field prepared especially for Mao, which appeared to be a bumper crop.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nThe local officials became trapped by these sham demonstrations to Mao, and exhorted the peasants to reach unattainable goals, by \"deep ploughing and close planting\", and other techniques. This ended up making things much worse, the crop failed completely, leaving barren fields. No one was in a position to challenge Mao's ideas as incorrect, so peasants pulled out their bedding and coats into the fields, added seeds and water, and after they sprouted, buried the materials under the soil once the seedlings were high enough.<ref name=\"becker\" />{{rp|122}}\n\nIn a similar manner to the massive Soviet-created famine in Ukraine (the [[Holodomor]]), doctors were prohibited from listing \"starvation\" as a cause of death on death certificates. This kind of deception was far from uncommon; a famous [[propaganda]] picture from the famine shows Chinese children from [[Shandong]] province ostensibly standing atop a field of wheat, so densely grown that it could apparently support their weight. In reality, they were standing on a bench concealed beneath the plants, and the \"field\" was again entirely composed of individually transplanted stalks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|title=Mao's Great Famine|last=International School History|date=21 January 2015|accessdate=19 September 2018|via=YouTube|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030033514/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKNEdojrsMo|archive-date=30 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>[http://www.disasterhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Standing-on-Grain-Propaganda-1959.jpg Aforementioned propaganda photo. ]\n\n=== Reflections ===\nIn April and May 1961, [[Liu Shaoqi]], then [[President of the People's Republic of China]], concluded after 44 days of field research in villages of [[Hunan]] that the reasons for the famine were 30% natural disaster and 70% human error.<ref name=\":4\">[http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html \u5218\u5c11\u5947\"\u4e09\u5206\u5929\u707e\uff0c\u4e03\u5206\u4eba\u7978\"\u63d0\u6cd5\u7684\u7531\u6765] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121214040606/http://cpc.people.com.cn/GB/64162/64172/85037/85039/5898093.html |date=14 December 2012 }}, Selection of the Party History (\u515a\u53f2\u535a\u91c7), 22 June 2007, Accessed Sept 1, 2018, CPC News. {{in lang|zh-Hans}}</ref><ref name=\":5\" /> Until the early 1980s, the [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]]'s stance, reflected by the name \"Three Years of Natural Disasters\", was that the famine was largely a result of a series of natural disasters compounded by several planning errors. \n\nResearchers outside China argued that massive institutional and policy changes that accompanied the Great Leap Forward were the key factors in the famine, or at least worsened nature-induced disasters.<ref>{{cite video|title=China: A Century of Revolution|date=1997|people=Sue Williams (director), Howard Sharp (editor), [[Will Lyman]] (narrator)|publisher=WinStar Home Entertainment}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Population|volume=1|pages=388\u2013390|year=2003|editor-last=Demeny|editor-first=Paul|contribution=Famine in China|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan Reference|editor2-last=McNicoll|editor2-first=Geoffrey}}</ref> In particular, Nobel laureate [[Amartya Sen]] puts this famine in a global context, arguing that lack of democracy is the major culprit: \"Indeed, no substantial famine has ever occurred in a democratic country\u2014no matter how poor.\" He adds that it is \"hard to imagine that anything like this could have happened in a country that goes to the polls regularly and that has an independent press.

The earth above and around them was as compact as any in the neighborhood. One of these coins I examined at the store of Chu Chong in Victoria. Neither in metal nor markings did it resemble the modern coins, but in its figures looked more like an Aztec calendar.

The similarities in ages and geographical distributions for C4c and the previously analyzed X2a lineage provide support to the scenario of a dual origin for Paleo-Indians.}}</ref>\n\n=== Claims involving ancient Roman contact ===\nEvidence of contacts with the civilizations of [[Classical Antiquity]]\u2014primarily with the [[Roman Empire]], but sometimes also with other cultures of the age\u2014have been based on isolated archaeological finds in American sites that originated in the Old World. The Bay of Jars in Brazil has been yielding ancient clay storage jars that resemble [[Amphora#Ancient Rome|Roman amphorae]]<ref>http://webmuseum.mit.edu/detail.php?type=related&kv=87136&t=objects</ref> for over 150 years. It has been proposed that the origin of these jars is a Roman wreck, although it has been suggested that they could be 15th or 16th century Spanish olive oil jars.\n\nRomeo Hristov argues that a Roman ship, or the drifting of such a shipwreck to the American shores, is a possible explanation of archaeological finds (like the Tecaxic-Calixtlahuaca bearded head) from ancient Rome in America. Hristov claims that the possibility of such an event has been made more likely by the discovery of evidences of travels by Romans to [[Tenerife]] and [[Lanzarote]] in the [[Canary Islands|Canaries]], and of a Roman settlement (from the 1st century BCE to the 4th century CE) on [[Lanzarote|Lanzarote island]].<ref>{{citation|last1=Hristov|first1=Romeo H.|last2=Genov\u00e9s T.|first2=Santiago|year=1999|title=Mesoamerica evidence of pre-Columbian transoceanic contacts|journal=Ancient Mesoamerica|volume=10|pages=207\u2013213|doi=10.1017/S0956536199102013|issue=2}}</ref>\n\n[[File:0 Mosaico pavimentale \u2013 Grotte Celloni \u2013 Pal.

[[Fray Diego Duran]], for his part, linked the legend of the Pre-Columbian god [[Quetzalcoatl]] (which he describes as being chaste, penitent, and a miracle-worker) to the Biblical accounts of Christian apostles. [[Fray Bartolome de las Casas]] describes Quetzalcoatl as being fair-skinned, tall, and bearded (therefore suggesting an Old World origin), while [[Fray Juan de Torquemada]] credits him with bringing agriculture to the Americas. Modern scholarship has cast serious doubts on several of these claims, since agriculture was practiced in the Americas well before the emergence of Christianity in the Old World, and Mayan crosses have been found to have a very different symbolism from that present in Christian religious traditions.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{Cite web | url=https://arqueologiamexicana.mx/mexico-antiguo/quetzalcoatl-blanco-y-de-ojos-azules |title = Quetzalc\u00f3atl \u00bfblanco y de ojos azules?|date = June 28, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Pre-Columbian myth, Quetzalcoatl departed Mexico in ancient times by travelling east across the ocean, promising he would return.

[[Carlos de Siguenza y Gongora]], for example, speculated that the Quetzalcoatl myth may have originated from a visit to the Americas by [[Thomas the Apostle]] in the 1st century CE. Later on, [[Servando Teresa de Mier|Fray Servando Teresa de Mier]] argued that the cloak with the image of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]], which the [[Catholic Church]] claims was worn by [[Juan Diego]], was instead brought to the Americas much earlier by Thomas, who used it as an instrument for [[evangelization]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nMexican historian [[Manuel Orozco y Berra]] conjectured that both the cross hieroglyphs and the Quetzalcoatl myth may have originated on a visit to Mesoamerica by a Catholic [[Norsemen|Norse]] missionary in medieval times.

The report is the first evidence that metal from Asia reached prehistoric North America before the contact with Europeans, stating that [[X-ray fluorescence]] identified two of these artifacts as smelted industrial alloys with large proportions of tin and lead. The presence of smelted alloys in a prehistoric Inuit context in northwest Alaska was demonstrated for the first time and indicates the movement of Eurasian metal across the Bering Strait into North America before sustained contact with Europeans.\n{{bquote|This is not a surprise based on oral history and other archaeological finds, and it was just a matter of time before we had a good example of Eurasian metal that had been traded [...] We believe these smelted alloys were made somewhere in Eurasia and traded to Siberia and then traded across the Bering Strait to ancestral {{sic|Inuits}} people, also known as Thule culture, in Alaska. Locally available metal in parts of the Arctic, such as native metal, copper and meteoritic and telluric iron were used by ancient Inuit people for tools and to sometimes indicate status. Two of the Cape Espenberg items that were found \u2013 a bead and a buckle \u2014 are heavily leaded bronze artifacts. Both are from a house at the site dating to the Late Prehistoric Period, around 1100-1300 AD, which is before sustained European contact in the late 18th century.

The earth above and around them was as compact as any in the neighborhood. One of these coins I examined at the store of Chu Chong in Victoria.

[[Fray Bartolome de las Casas]] describes Quetzalcoatl as being fair-skinned, tall, and bearded (therefore suggesting an Old World origin), while [[Fray Juan de Torquemada]] credits him with bringing agriculture to the Americas.

It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]]. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[Work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a [[water wheel]].

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nEntropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

According to Carnot's principle, [[work (physics)|work]] can only be produced by the system when there is a temperature difference, and the work should be some function of the difference in temperature and the heat absorbed ({{math|''Q''<sub>H</sub>}}).

The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by [[James Prescott Joule|Joule]] in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115\u2013158}}</ref> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>W=Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system.

This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.org/lin/entropy/cgibbs.pdf |title=Jaynes, E.

It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy that may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\n\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. If the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work \u2013 the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, U_0, t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>. This means that tribo-fatigue entropy is a measure of the absorption of energy caused by all sources. Determination procedures of ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup> have been developed (see, for example.<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2005\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L.

A 2007\"/> which states: the development of irreversible damage processes is possible and is realized with a certain probability ''\u0420''>0, when a finite region ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub> with a nonzero level of effective energy ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>>0 (internal entropy ''S''<sub>''i''</sub>>0) arises in the object \u2013 a dangerous volume\n\n<math>V_{P\\gamma} \\in V_{P\\gamma} \\left(Q_i, U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}, S_i\\right) \\ge 0,</math>\n\nwhere ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2013 are internal force factors.\n\nIf ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>=0, then \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>=0 and, therefore, the evolution of an object by damage is impossi-ble (reversible system). In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume). Calculation methods and classification of dangerous volumes (''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>) for typical material objects (deformable solids and systems) under various conditions have been developed (see, for example <ref name=\"Sherbakov, S. S 2010\"/>). The scale of system damage can be any.\n\nUsing the concept of tribo-fatigue entropy, one can give an entropic interpretation of damage: irreversible damage to an object is identical to a change in internal entropy in its dangerous volume\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(S_{TF}) \\equiv \\frac{(d_i S)_{TF}}{dV_{P\\gamma}} = \\omega_{\\Sigma S}.</math>\n\nAn open thermodynamic system in which damaged or solid objects are distributed (scattered) are called a mechanothermodynamic system (MTD).

According to him, it is the growth of tribo-fatigue entropy, due to the thermomechanical state of the system, that can lead to both destruction and decomposition of moving and deformable objects and systems; in thermodynamic equations such states are out of the question. This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction (\u039b<sub>''ij''</sub>, \u039b<sub>''TD/TF''</sub>) between the components of entropy.\n\nWe also note that the \u039b-functions defined here at the macro level turn out to be quite similar to the non-additivity parameters in the q-calculus [91], on the basis of which, for example, the statistical theory of non-additive systems at the nanoscale has been developed [92]. This indicates the fundamental nature of modern concepts of non-additive systems. The mechanothermodynamic system can be considered, therefore, as one of them.\n\nThus, it follows from the foregoing that the evolution of the system in the general case is determined by the intensity of the processes of irreversible changes in entropy \u2013 thermodynamic and tribo-fatigue; the production of internal mechanothermodynamic entropy is as eternal as motion and damage.\n\n=== Thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts ===\n<!-- Note: renamed from \"definitions\" as these are not differing definitions of entropy \u2013 they are various concepts which are related to or use the concept of entropy; some may define a particular way of determining entropy in some specific circumstance -->\n* Entropy unit \u2013 a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" and equal to one [[calorie]] per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 [[joule]]s per kelvin per mole.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02151|title=Entropy unit}}</ref>\n* [[Gibbs entropy]] \u2013 the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.\n* [[Boltzmann entropy]] \u2013 a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.\n* [[Tsallis entropy]] \u2013 a generalization of the standard Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy.\n* [[Standard molar entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.\n* [[Residual entropy]] \u2013 the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to [[absolute zero]].\n* [[Entropy of mixing]] \u2013 the change in the entropy when two different [[chemical substance]]s or [[component (thermodynamics)|components]] are mixed.\n* [[Loop entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.\n* [[Conformational entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a [[polymer]] chain that assumes a compact or [[globular protein|globular]] state in solution.\n* [[Entropic force]] \u2013 a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.\n* [[Free entropy]] \u2013 an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.\n* [[Entropic explosion]] \u2013  an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.\n* Entropy change \u2013 a change in entropy ''dS'' between two [[equilibrium state]]s is given by the heat transferred ''dQ''<sub>rev</sub> divided by the [[absolute temperature]] ''T'' of the [[thermodynamic system|system]] in this interval.\n* [[Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation|Sackur\u2013Tetrode entropy]] \u2013 the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\n\n=== The arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]]. As time progresses, the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an [[isolated system]] never decreases in large systems over significant periods of time. Hence, from this perspective, entropy measurement is thought of as a clock in these conditions.\n\n===Entropy in DNA sequences===\n\nEntropy has been proven useful in the analysis of DNA sequences.

It has been speculated, since the 19th century, that the universe is fated to a [[heat death of the universe|heat death]] in which all the [[energy]] ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy so that no more work can be extracted from any source.\n\nIf the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy, then \u2013 as [[Roger Penrose]] has pointed out \u2013 [[gravity]] plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars, which collapse eventually into [[black hole]]s.

It is closely related to the number {{math|\u03a9}} of microscopic configurations (known as [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that are consistent with the macroscopic quantities that characterize the system (such as its volume, pressure and temperature). Entropy expresses the number {{math|\u03a9}} of different configurations that a system defined by macroscopic variables could assume.<ref>{{cite book|first=Roberto|last=Ligrone|date=2019|chapter=Glossary|department=Entropy|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=c86aDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA478|title=Biological Innovations that Built the World: A Four-billion-year Journey through Life & Earth History|page=478|isbn=978-3030160562|publisher=Springer|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> Under the assumption that each microstate is equally probable, the entropy <math>S</math> is the [[natural logarithm]] of the number of microstates, multiplied by the [[Boltzmann constant]] {{math|''k''<sub>B</sub>}}. Formally (assuming equiprobable microstates),\n\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\ln \\Omega .</math>\n\nMacroscopic systems typically have a very large number {{math|\u03a9}} of possible microscopic configurations.  For example, the entropy of an [[ideal gas]] is proportional to the number of gas molecules {{math|''N''}}.  The number of molecules in 22.4 liters of gas at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|standard temperature and pressure]] is roughly 6.022 \u00d7 10<sup>23</sup> (the [[Avogadro number]]).\n\nThe [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases over time. Isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the state with maximum entropy. Non-isolated systems, like [[organisms]], may lose entropy, provided their environment's entropy increases by at least that amount so that the total entropy either increases or remains constant. Therefore, the entropy in a specific system can decrease as long as the total entropy of the [[Universe]] does not. Entropy is a function of the [[state function|state of the system]], so the change in entropy of a system is determined by its initial and final states. In the idealization that a process is [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible]], the entropy does not change, while irreversible processes always increase the total entropy.\n\nBecause it is determined by the number of random microstates, entropy is related to the amount of additional information needed to specify the exact physical state of a system, given its macroscopic specification. For this reason, it is often said that entropy is an expression of the disorder, or [[randomness]] of a system, or of the lack of information about it.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Edward A.|last1=Rietman|first2=Jack A.|last2=Tuszynski|editor-first1=Yuzhuo|editor-last1=Wang|editor-first2=Francesco|editor-last2=Crea|date=2017|chapter=Thermodynamics & Cancer Dormancy: A Perspective|department=Introduction: Entropy & Information|chapter-url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=g6UzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA63|title=Tumor Dormancy & Recurrence (Cancer Drug Discovery and Development)|page=63|isbn=978-3319592404|publisher=Humana Press|accessdate=2019-08-29}}</ref> The concept of entropy plays a central role in [[information theory]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Clausius.jpg|thumb|upright|{{nowrap|[[Rudolf Clausius]]}} {{nowrap|(1822\u20131888),}} originator of the concept of entropy]]\n{{Main|History of entropy}}\n\nThe French mathematician [[Lazare Carnot]] proposed in his 1803 paper ''Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement'' that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of ''moment of activity''; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful [[energy]]. Building on this work, in 1824 Lazare's son [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] published ''[[Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire]]'', which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"[[caloric theory|caloric]]\" (what is now known as [[heat]]) falls through a temperature difference, work or [[Work (physics)|motive power]] can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a [[water wheel]].

In 1877 Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of [[ideal gas]] particles, in which he defined entropy as proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy. Henceforth, the essential problem in [[statistical thermodynamics]] has been to determine the distribution of a given amount of energy ''E'' over ''N'' identical systems.\n[[Carath\u00e9odory]] linked entropy with a mathematical definition of irreversibility, in terms of trajectories and integrability.\n\n== Etymology ==\nIn 1865, Clausius named the concept of {{mvar|S}}, \"the differential of a quantity which depends on the configuration of the system,\" ''[[wikt:entropy|entropy]]'' ({{lang|de|Entropie}}) after the Greek word for 'transformation'.<ref name=Gil399>{{cite book |last=Gillispie |first=Charles Coulston |authorlink1=Charles Coulston Gillispie |title=The Edge of Objectivity: An Essay in the History of Scientific Ideas |url=https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit0000gill |url-access=registration |year=1960 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=0-691-02350-6 |p=[https://archive.org/details/edgeofobjectivit0000gill/page/399 399]}}</ref>  He gives \"transformational content\" ({{lang|de|Verwandlungsinhalt}}) as a synonym, paralleling his \"thermal and ergonal content\" ({{lang|de|W\u00e4rme- und Werkinhalt}}) as the name of [[Internal energy|{{mvar|U}}]], but preferring the term ''entropy'' as a close parallel of the word ''energy'', as he found the concepts nearly \"analogous in their physical significance.\"<ref name=Gil399/> This term was formed by replacing the root of {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd}} ('work') by that of {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae|\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae]]}} ('transformation').<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Clausius |first1=Rudolf |date=1865 |title=Ueber verschiedene f\u00fcr die Anwendung bequeme Formen der Hauptgleichungen der mechanischen W\u00e4rmetheorie (Vorgetragen in der naturforsch.

Historically, the classical thermodynamics definition developed first. In the [[classical thermodynamics]] viewpoint, the microscopic details of a system are not considered. Instead, the behavior of a system is described in terms of a set of empirically defined thermodynamic variables, such as temperature, pressure, entropy, and heat capacity. The classical thermodynamics description assumes a state of equilibrium although more recent attempts have been made to develop useful definitions of entropy in [[Nonequilibrium thermodynamics|nonequilibrium]] systems as well.\n\nThe [[Statistical mechanics|statistical definition]] of entropy and other thermodynamic properties were developed later. In this viewpoint, thermodynamic properties are defined in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, [[phonons]], spins, etc.).\n\n=== Function of state ===\nThere are many  [[thermodynamic properties]] that are [[functions of state]]. This means that at a particular thermodynamic state (which should not be confused with the microscopic state of a system), these properties have a certain value. Often, if two properties of the system are determined, then the state is determined and the other properties' values can also be determined. For instance, a quantity of gas at a particular temperature and pressure has its state fixed by those values and thus has a specific  volume that is determined by those values.  As another instance, a system composed of a pure substance of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy.<ref>J.

In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the [[line integral]] of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\n\n=== Reversible process ===\nEntropy is conserved for a [[reversible process (thermodynamics)|reversible process]]. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible.  In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost.  More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process.<ref>{{cite web|title=6.5 Irreversibility, Entropy Changes, and ''Lost Work''|url=http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/thermodynamics/notes/node48.html|website=web.mit.edu|accessdate=21 May 2016}}</ref> For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the ''total'' entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible.

According to Carnot's principle, [[work (physics)|work]] can only be produced by the system when there is a temperature difference, and the work should be some function of the difference in temperature and the heat absorbed ({{math|''Q''<sub>H</sub>}}).

This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Clerk Maxwel|first1=James|editor1-last=Pesic|editor1-first=Peter|title=Theory of heat|date=2001|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola|isbn=978-0-486-41735-6|pages=115\u2013158}}</ref> It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\n\n{{NumBlk|:|<math>W=Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}</math>|{{EquationRef|2}}}}\n\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle.

Clausius called this state function ''entropy''. One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\n\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\n\n: <math> W<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\n\n: <math> Q_\\text{H}-Q_\\text{C}<\\left(1-\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}\\right)Q_\\text{H}</math>\n: or\n: <math> Q_\\text{C}>\\frac{T_\\text{C}}{T_\\text{H}}Q_\\text{H}</math>\n\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by {{math|''S''<sub>''i''</sub> {{=}} ''Q''<sub>''i''</sub>/''T''<sub>''i''</sub>}} for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\n\n:<math>S_\\text{H}-S_\\text{C}<0</math>\n: or\n:<math>S_\\text{H}<S_\\text{C}</math>\n\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\n\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system.  Other cycles, such as the [[Otto cycle]], [[Diesel cycle]] and [[Brayton cycle]], can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\n\n=== Classical thermodynamics ===\n{{Main|Entropy (classical thermodynamics)}}  {{Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)}}\n\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by [[Rudolf Clausius]] and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an [[isolated system]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]] with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the [[Carnot cycle]]. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its [[absolute temperature]]). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a [[function of state]], specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\n\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the [[second law of thermodynamics]], entropy of an isolated [[Thermodynamic system|system]] always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may ''not'' flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\n\nAccording to the [[Clausius theorem|Clausius equality]], for a reversible cyclic process:\n<math>\\oint \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T} = 0.</math>\nThis means the line integral <math>\\int_L \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}</math> is [[State function|path-independent]].\n\nSo we can define a state function {{mvar|S}} called entropy, which satisfies\n<math>d S = \\frac{\\delta Q_\\text{rev}}{T}.</math>\n\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Atkins|first=Peter|author2=Julio De Paula|title=Physical Chemistry, 8th ed.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|page=79|isbn=978-0-19-870072-2}}</ref> Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Engel|first=Thomas|author2=Philip Reid|title=Physical Chemistry|publisher=Pearson Benjamin Cummings|year=2006|page=86|isbn=978-0-8053-3842-3}}</ref> However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\n\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the [[third law of thermodynamics]], which states that ''S'' = 0 at [[absolute zero]] for perfect crystals.\n\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in [[classical thermodynamics]] the entropy is interpreted as a [[state function]] of a [[thermodynamic system]]: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394''E'', and its entropy falls by \u0394''S'', a quantity at least ''T''<sub>R</sub> \u0394''S'' of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (''T''<sub>R</sub> is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]].\n\n=== Statistical mechanics ===\nThe statistical definition was developed by [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as [[Boltzmann's constant]]. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\n\nThe [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics]] is the measure of uncertainty, or ''mixedupness'' in the phrase of [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]], which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible [[Microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]. In contrast to  the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder).<ref name=McH>{{cite book|last1=Licker|first1=Mark D.|title=McGraw-Hill concise encyclopedia of chemistry.|date=2004|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|location=New York|isbn=978-0-07-143953-4}}</ref><ref name=\"Sethna78\" /><ref>{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=John O.E.|title=The essential dictionary of science|date=2004|publisher=Barnes & Noble|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7607-4616-5}}</ref> This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system ([[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) that could cause the observed macroscopic state ([[macrostate]]) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the [[Boltzmann constant]].\n\nBoltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have [[dimension (physics)|dimensions]] of [[energy]] divided by [[temperature]], which has a unit of [[joule]]s per [[kelvin]] (J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>) in the [[International System of Units]] (or kg\u22c5m<sup>2</sup>\u22c5s<sup>\u22122</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup> in terms of base units). The entropy of a substance is usually given as an [[Intensive and extensive properties#Intensive properties|intensive property]]{{snd}}either entropy per unit [[mass]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>) or entropy per unit [[amount of substance]] (SI unit: J\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>).\n\nSpecifically, entropy is a [[logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied:\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\sum_i p_i \\log p_i,</math>\n\nor, equivalently, the expected value of [[Entropy (information theory)#Rationale|the logarithm of the probability]] that a microstate is occupied\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{E}_i(\\log p_i)</math>\n\nwhere ''k''<sub>B</sub> is the [[Boltzmann constant]], equal to {{val|1.38065|e=-23|u=J/K}}.\nThe summation is over all the possible microstates of the system, and ''p<sub>i</sub>'' is the probability that the system is in the ''i''-th microstate.<ref name=\"Perplexed\">[http://charlottewerndl.net/Entropy_Guide.pdf Frigg, R. and Werndl, C. \"Entropy \u2013 A Guide for the Perplexed\"].

In a different basis set, the more general expression is\n\n:<math>S = -k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\operatorname{Tr}(\\widehat{\\rho} \\log(\\widehat{\\rho})),</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\widehat{\\rho}</math> is the [[density matrix]], <math>\\operatorname{Tr}</math> is [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]] and <math>\\log</math> is the [[matrix logarithm]]. This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for ''S'' can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\n\nIn what has been called ''the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics'' or ''[[Fundamental postulate of statistical mechanics|the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics]]'', the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. ''p''<sub>''i''</sub> = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schroeder|first1=Daniel V.|title=An introduction to thermal physics|date=2000|publisher=Addison Wesley|location=San Francisco, CA |isbn=978-0-201-38027-9|page=57|edition=}}</ref> Then the previous equation reduces to\n:<math>S = k_{\\mathrm{B}} \\log \\Omega.</math>\n\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the [[microcanonical ensemble]]).\n\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The [[equilibrium state]] of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/sethna/StatMech/EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf |title=EntropyOrderParametersComplexity.pdf www.physics.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-08-17}}</ref> This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\n\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables ''U'', ''V'' and ''W'', and observer B uses ''U'', ''V'', ''W'', ''X'', then, by changing ''X'', observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy!<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mdpi.org/lin/entropy/cgibbs.pdf |title=Jaynes, E.

(Dark-blue is liquid water, light-blue is liquid-steam mixture, and faint-blue is steam. Grey-blue represents supercritical liquid water.)]]\n\nEntropy arises directly from the [[Carnot cycle]]. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\n\nIn a [[thermodynamic system]], pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the [[equilibrium state]] has higher [[probability]] (more possible [[combination]]s of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]]) than any other state.\n\nAs an example, for a glass of [[ice]] water in air at [[room temperature]], the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the [[thermal energy]] from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\n\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an [[isolated system]] such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the [[thermodynamic system]] is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\n\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved [[state function]] that is of great importance in the sciences of [[physics]] and [[chemistry]].<ref name=\"McH\" /><ref name=\"Wiley91\">{{cite book|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley I.|title=Chemical, biochemical, and engineering thermodynamics|date=2006|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|location=New York|isbn=978-0-471-66174-0|page=91|edition=4th}}</ref> Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their [[T-symmetry|time reversals]] (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy.<ref name=\"McQuarrie817\">{{cite book|last1=Simon|first1=Donald A.

The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that a closed system has entropy that may increase or otherwise remain constant.

For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine.  A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\n\nA special case of entropy increase, the [[entropy of mixing]], occurs when two or more different substances are mixed.

Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat can't flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work (the imposition of order) to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing [[adiabatic cooling]], which performs [[adiabatic process|adiabatic work]]. As a result, there is no possibility of a [[perpetual motion]] system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a [[chemical reaction]], means that it is energetically more efficient.\n\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An [[air conditioner]], for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\n\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the [[fundamental thermodynamic relation]] places limits on a system's ability to do [[work (thermodynamics)|useful work]].<ref name=\"Daintith\">{{Cite book|last=Daintith| first=John|title=Oxford Dictionary of Physics|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-19-280628-4}}</ref> The entropy change of a system at temperature ''T'' absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat ''\u03b4q''\nin a reversible way, is given by ''\u03b4q''/''T''.

In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy ''U'' to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the ''fundamental thermodynamic relation''. If external pressure ''p'' bears on the volume ''V'' as the only external parameter, this relation is:\n\n: <math>dU = T \\, dS - p \\, dV</math>\n\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature ''T'', implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the entropy, pressure and temperature may not exist).\n\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the [[Maxwell relations]] and the [[relations between heat capacities]].\n\n=== Entropy in chemical thermodynamics ===\nThermodynamic entropy is central in [[chemical thermodynamics]], enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The [[second law of thermodynamics]] states that entropy in an [[isolated system]] \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \u03b4''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' = \u0394''S'' introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394''S''. Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\n\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit [[joule]] per [[kelvin]] (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\n\nThermodynamic entropy is an [[Intensive and extensive properties|extensive]] property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an [[Intensive and extensive properties|intensive property]] independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the [[kilogram]] (unit: J\u22c5kg<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one [[Mole (unit)|mole]] of substance, in which case it is called the ''molar entropy'' with a unit of J\u22c5mol<sup>\u22121</sup>\u22c5K<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\nThus, when one mole of substance at about {{val|0|u=K}} is warmed by its surroundings to {{val|298|u=K}}, the sum of the incremental values of ''q''<sub>rev</sub>/''T'' constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at {{val|298|u=K}}.<ref name=\"ctms\">{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=J.

For the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the Shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of yes/no questions needed to determine the content of the message.<ref name=\"Perplexed\" />\n\nThe question of the link between information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is a debated topic.

Thus, damage is interpreted as a fundamental property (and obligation) of moving and deformable systems.\n\nThe complex (\u03a3) of irreversible damage (\u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub>) is determined by the effective (absorbed in the system) energy (''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup>), caused by forces of any nature:\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(U_\\Sigma^\\mathit{eff}) = \\omega_\\Sigma \\left(U_n^\\mathit{eff}, U_\\tau^\\mathit{eff}, U_T^\\mathit{eff}, U_{ch}^\\mathit{eff}, \\ldots, \u039b_ij, U_0, t \\right) = \\omega_{\\Sigma U} \\ge 0</math>\n\nHere, the indices ''n'' and \u03c4 indicate normal and shear mechanical loads, ''T'' and ''Ch'' indicate thermal and electrochemical loads that generate the corresponding energy fluxes.\n\nThus, damage \u03c9<sub>\u03a3</sub> is an energy thermomechanical function, since it takes into account both any force factors and temperature ''T''<sub>\u03a3</sub>. This means that tribo-fatigue entropy is a measure of the absorption of energy caused by all sources. Determination procedures of ''U''<sub>\u03a3</sub><sup>(''eff'')</sup> have been developed (see, for example.<ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L. A 2005\"/><ref name=\"Sosnovskiy, L.

In an irreversible system ''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>\u2264''V'' there is an absolute value (measure) of its spatial damage (''V'' is its geometric volume). Calculation methods and classification of dangerous volumes (''V''<sub>''p''\u03b3</sub>) for typical material objects (deformable solids and systems) under various conditions have been developed (see, for example <ref name=\"Sherbakov, S. S 2010\"/>). The scale of system damage can be any.\n\nUsing the concept of tribo-fatigue entropy, one can give an entropic interpretation of damage: irreversible damage to an object is identical to a change in internal entropy in its dangerous volume\n\n<math>\\omega_\\Sigma(S_{TF}) \\equiv \\frac{(d_i S)_{TF}}{dV_{P\\gamma}} = \\omega_{\\Sigma S}.</math>\n\nAn open thermodynamic system in which damaged or solid objects are distributed (scattered) are called a mechanothermodynamic system (MTD).

According to him, it is the growth of tribo-fatigue entropy, due to the thermomechanical state of the system, that can lead to both destruction and decomposition of moving and deformable objects and systems; in thermodynamic equations such states are out of the question. This equation is constructed taking into account various mechanisms of interaction (\u039b<sub>''ij''</sub>, \u039b<sub>''TD/TF''</sub>) between the components of entropy.\n\nWe also note that the \u039b-functions defined here at the macro level turn out to be quite similar to the non-additivity parameters in the q-calculus [91], on the basis of which, for example, the statistical theory of non-additive systems at the nanoscale has been developed [92]. This indicates the fundamental nature of modern concepts of non-additive systems. The mechanothermodynamic system can be considered, therefore, as one of them.\n\nThus, it follows from the foregoing that the evolution of the system in the general case is determined by the intensity of the processes of irreversible changes in entropy \u2013 thermodynamic and tribo-fatigue; the production of internal mechanothermodynamic entropy is as eternal as motion and damage.\n\n=== Thermodynamic and statistical mechanics concepts ===\n<!-- Note: renamed from \"definitions\" as these are not differing definitions of entropy \u2013 they are various concepts which are related to or use the concept of entropy; some may define a particular way of determining entropy in some specific circumstance -->\n* Entropy unit \u2013 a non-S.I. unit of thermodynamic entropy, usually denoted \"e.u.\" and equal to one [[calorie]] per kelvin per mole, or 4.184 [[joule]]s per kelvin per mole.<ref>{{GoldBookRef|file=E02151|title=Entropy unit}}</ref>\n* [[Gibbs entropy]] \u2013 the usual statistical mechanical entropy of a thermodynamic system.\n* [[Boltzmann entropy]] \u2013 a type of Gibbs entropy, which neglects internal statistical correlations in the overall particle distribution.\n* [[Tsallis entropy]] \u2013 a generalization of the standard Boltzmann\u2013Gibbs entropy.\n* [[Standard molar entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy content of one mole of substance, under conditions of standard temperature and pressure.\n* [[Residual entropy]] \u2013 the entropy present after a substance is cooled arbitrarily close to [[absolute zero]].\n* [[Entropy of mixing]] \u2013 the change in the entropy when two different [[chemical substance]]s or [[component (thermodynamics)|components]] are mixed.\n* [[Loop entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance.\n* [[Conformational entropy]] \u2013 is the entropy associated with the physical arrangement of a [[polymer]] chain that assumes a compact or [[globular protein|globular]] state in solution.\n* [[Entropic force]] \u2013 a microscopic force or reaction tendency related to system organization changes, molecular frictional considerations, and statistical variations.\n* [[Free entropy]] \u2013 an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy.\n* [[Entropic explosion]] \u2013  an explosion in which the reactants undergo a large change in volume without releasing a large amount of heat.\n* Entropy change \u2013 a change in entropy ''dS'' between two [[equilibrium state]]s is given by the heat transferred ''dQ''<sub>rev</sub> divided by the [[absolute temperature]] ''T'' of the [[thermodynamic system|system]] in this interval.\n* [[Sackur\u2013Tetrode equation|Sackur\u2013Tetrode entropy]] \u2013 the entropy of a monatomic classical ideal gas determined via quantum considerations.\n\n=== The arrow of time ===\n{{Main|Entropy (arrow of time)}}\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an [[arrow of time]].
