Cayey is spread over 21 wards plus Cayey Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center). It is part of the [[San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nCayey is notable for its surrounding mountains.  The city has been actively growing since the 1990s, evidenced by its designation as a Metropolitan Area by the U.S. Census Bureau.  It has experienced significant growth in commerce, and many major retailers, such as [[Wal-Mart]] have opened stores in the city.  Industries in Cayey include sugar, tobacco and poultry. For tobacco there is a well-known company called Consolidated Cigar Corp.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia|last=|first=|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=Credo}}</ref> A new coliseum and hospital facilities have also been built.  [[Coca-Cola]] is a major corporation that has a manufacturing facility in the town.  Cayey is also host to one of the campuses of the University of Puerto Rico, the [[University of Puerto Rico at Cayey]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Cultivating tobacco at the vicinity of Cayey, Puerto Rico.jpg|300px|right|Cultivating tobacco in Cayey, 1941]]\n\nCayey was founded on August 17, 1773, by Juan Mata V\u00e1zquez, who became its first mayor. It is said that Cayey derives its name from the Taino Indian word for \"a place of waters\". Its original name was \"Cayey de Muesas\" in honor of [[:es:Miguel de Muesas|Miguel de Muesas]], the then governor of Puerto Rico. The town is located in a valley nestled between Puerto Rico's [[Cordillera Central (Puerto Rico)|Cordillera Central]] mountain range and the [[:es:Sierra de Cayey|Sierra de Cayey]] at roughly the midpoint of routes [[Puerto Rico Highway 1|PR-1]] and [[Puerto Rico Highway 52|PR-52]]. The routes lead to a road that provides a panoramic view of the island.\n\nWhen after the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)]], the U.S. conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, the population of Cayey was 14,442.<ref name=\"OfficeSanger1900\">{{cite book|author1=Joseph Prentiss Sanger|author2=Henry Gannett|author3=Walter Francis Willcox|title=Informe sobre el censo de Puerto Rico, 1899, United States. War Dept. Porto Rico Census Office|url=https://archive.org/details/informesobreelc00joangoog|year=1900|publisher=Imprenta del gobierno|page=[https://archive.org/details/informesobreelc00joangoog/page/n253 162]| language=es}}</ref>\n\nCayey's economy has been and remains agriculturally based on tobacco, sugar cane and general fruits. Its agricultural economy that evolved starting in the 1950s has diminished considerably. Most of its agricultural products are imported from other islands in the Caribbean or mainland United States.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century,<ref>Life in Cayey during the first part of the 20th century, and the last part of the 19th century, is detailed in \"Obras Completas\" by Cayey's native son Miguel Melendez Mu\u00f1oz</ref> Cayey was basically an agricultural area of small farmers and local haciendas dedicated to the farming of crops for the local market. During the 1920s and 1930s farmers increasingly lost their land to absentee landowners, mostly American companies, that turned to the cultivation of sugar cane and, to a lesser extent, tobacco for export. In the 1950s and 1960s some manufacturing concerns established plants in Cayey taking advantage of tax incentives offered by \"Operation Bootstrap\", Puerto Rico's industrialization program.\n\nAn industrial base, in 1947 Cayey saw the beginning of industrial entrepreneurship. There were three factories in town, the Caribe Flower Co. in the Palo Seco neighborhood, a Baseball Factory in the Toita neighborhood, and a Uniform Factory in the back of the High School. These factories employed mostly females. By 1950 the men that worked agriculture became excess population and began migrating to the United States or join the military. In 1950 with the approval of Fomento Industrial and Operation Bootstrap there was a boom of light factories in Cayey. The Gordonshire Knitting Mill in the Guayama road had twelve large buildings and ran two shifts with more than 1,000 employees, and the Consolidated Cigar Corporation across from the road from the Reparto Montellano neighborhood operated three shifts employing over 2,500 from Cayey and surrounding towns.\n\nAn education base began in the early to mid-1950s when the Inter-American University opened a branch in Cayey providing teacher training through a night class scheme. In 1967 the University of Puerto Rico opened a campus in the former Henry Barracks Military Reservation, and in the early 1980s El Turabo University, subsidiary of the Ana G. Mendez conglomerate opened a campus in the old Tabaco Factory at the entrance of town. The Interamerican University will be opening a Graduate campus in front of the Plaza (Center of town), and there are conversations with a foreign educational concern to open a technology campus using the buildings left over by the Gordonshire Knitting Mills. There are three major private schools: Radians School, the long established Colegio de Nuestra Senora de la Merced and La Milagrosa School. Cayey's health care base expanded in the mid-1960s with the Mennoite Medical Center and a Municipal\nHospital along with laboratories, and urgent care centers that cater to the poor and the elderly.\n\nWith the construction of the Interstate (route 52), Cayey has evolved into a  \"bedroom community\" with gated housing developments, located just 30 minutes away from San Juan and 45 minutes away from Ponce. With pleasant weather and good private schools, Cayey has become a premium location for the affluent.\n\n==Impact of Henry Barracks Military Reservation==\n\n[[Henry Barracks, Puerto Rico|Henry Barracks]] Military Reservation was a lifeline for the residents of Cayey from 1901 to 1966, when it was declared excess land and passed to the General Services Administration for decommission. The property consisted of 439.92 acres (<ref>FUDS (27 Sept 2006). Project Fact Sheet-August 2005. Jacksonville, FLA: Army Corps of Engineer</ref>). The property was divided into three prominent encampments: the Spanish Camp- Campamento Espa\u00f1ol (15 acres), Camp Henry or Henry Barracks, the Home of the third Battalion of the 65th Inf. Regiment that consisted of 372 acres, and 67 acres the Cayey Naval Radio Station (67 acres) <ref>(Department of the Navy (1915). Map showing boundary lines of the original Spanish Reservation and the present reservation February 7, 1903: Washington, D.C.: Bureau of Yards & Docks, Department of the Navy</ref>). This reservation is situated in the east of the town of Cayey. The Spanish Reservation containing an area of approximately 15 acres, known as Hospital Hill was set apart by Executive Order of June 30, 1903, under an Act of Congress approved on July 7, 1902.<ref>Executive Order of June 30, 1903, under an Act of Congress approved on July 7, 1902</ref> The main army post was located in the northern part of the reservation, initially housing the Puerto Rico Volunteer Infantry Regiment.\n\nThe combined posts had approximately 1200 men who used the resources provided by the town people. Families moved into Punta Brava and Vieques neighborhoods. A laundry, show shop, and other smaller stores were located right outside the gate. By 1906 about 350 civilians had jobs in the two posts (Camp Henry and The Cayey Navy Radio Station).\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Navy submitted a proposal to raise three 620 feet tall masts as part of a global radio communication linkage. In 1916 the Department of the navy approved a budget of $40,000. At the time 300 men were hired to build the facility for a period of two year, the project was completed in 1918 <ref>(Hopper, S.C. (1922) Development of high power radio and its practical applications in the Services of the United States Navy.

All the land held by the Navy included Magazine Hill (known in the community as \"El Polvorin\"), which was taken over by the U. S. Army. The 65th Infantry Regiment remained in the north side of the post. The south side was converted into two 1,000 feet shooting ranges<ref>( Parsons, Inc (2010).

U.S. Army. p.4</ref>\n\nBy 1953, the U.S. Department of the Army had reached the conclusion that Henry Barracks would be closed in the near future. A full complement of maintenance personnel composed of professional, technical, and daily laborers were maintained in the Reservation. The growth of three major housing developments is evidence of the economic impact of the Reservation (Reparto Montellano, El Polvorin, Urbanizaci\u00f3n Aponte)<ref>Personal communication with Maj. Manuel Rivera Garcia (ret.) and Harry Benett, J.D.(August 24, 2014)</ref>\nWhile the all-Puerto Rican 65th Inf regiment would never return to its home base, several other initiatives were undertaken, which had a direct impact on the economic development of the town and the region, one such initiatives was the commissioning of the Caribbean Signal Agency in 1959.  Over the coming years several tenants occupied the lands comprised by the Henry Barracks Military Reservation, among them:\n*\tIn the company size building to the west of the quad, the National Guard had its Officer Training School in 1965 and 1966. It was later moved to Camp Santiago in Salinas.  The golf course was used as a helicopter landing strip.\n*\tYMCA Cuerpos de Paz, and VESPRA (1965\u201368) had an Administration Building, a swimming pool, a golf course and three houses, which housed the majors and their families.<ref>El Mundo, 26 de enero 1965, p.7-8</ref>\n*\tThe Encampment for Citizenship held its 1966 six-week encampment in the  two-company building in the middle of the quad.

Because of its location, Cayey is known for its mountains, its cool weather and its misty mornings, especially in winter.

Native from Cayey, Puerto Rico, golden coqu\u00eds have only been found in areas of dense bromeliad growth in the Sierra de Cayey of Puerto Rico between 2,123 and 2,575 feet (647 and 785 meters) above sea level. They get their name from the song the male coquis sing at night. It sounds like \"cokee, cokee\" so that is why they are called coqui in Spanish. The golden coqui is the smallest of the coqui frogs in Puerto Rico. Mature adult coquis are only roughly the size of a dime. Male coquis are more bright yellow where females tend to be more light yellow and brown. The golden coqui is the only frog species in the New World known to give birth to live young. These frogs are known around the whole island of Puerto Rico.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/species/amphibians/coqui_llanero/natural_history.html|title=Natural history|website= Biological Diversity|access-date=2016-05-05}}</ref>\n\n===Barrios===\n[[File:Cayey, Puerto Rico locator map.png|thumb|Subdivisions of Cayey.]]\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Cayey is subdivided into [[Barrios of Puerto Rico|barrios]].

Rico|Cidra]] and [[Caguas, Puerto Rico|Caguas]]; east of [[Aibonito, Puerto Rico|Aibonito]] and Salinas; and west of [[San Lorenzo, Puerto Rico|San Lorenzo]]. Cayey is spread over 21 wards plus Cayey Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center). It is part of the [[San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nCayey is notable for its surrounding mountains.  The city has been actively growing since the 1990s, evidenced by its designation as a Metropolitan Area by the U.S. Census Bureau.  It has experienced significant growth in commerce, and many major retailers, such as [[Wal-Mart]] have opened stores in the city.  Industries in Cayey include sugar, tobacco and poultry. For tobacco there is a well-known company called Consolidated Cigar Corp.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia|last=|first=|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=Credo}}</ref> A new coliseum and hospital facilities have also been built.  [[Coca-Cola]] is a major corporation that has a manufacturing facility in the town.  Cayey is also host to one of the campuses of the University of Puerto Rico, the [[University of Puerto Rico at Cayey]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Cultivating tobacco at the vicinity of Cayey, Puerto Rico.jpg|300px|right|Cultivating tobacco in Cayey, 1941]]\n\nCayey was founded on August 17, 1773, by Juan Mata V\u00e1zquez, who became its first mayor. It is said that Cayey derives its name from the Taino Indian word for \"a place of waters\". Its original name was \"Cayey de Muesas\" in honor of [[:es:Miguel de Muesas|Miguel de Muesas]], the then governor of Puerto Rico. The town is located in a valley nestled between Puerto Rico's [[Cordillera Central (Puerto Rico)|Cordillera Central]] mountain range and the [[:es:Sierra de Cayey|Sierra de Cayey]] at roughly the midpoint of routes [[Puerto Rico Highway 1|PR-1]] and [[Puerto Rico Highway 52|PR-52]]. The routes lead to a road that provides a panoramic view of the island.\n\nWhen after the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)]], the U.S. conducted its first census of Puerto Rico, the population of Cayey was 14,442.<ref name=\"OfficeSanger1900\">{{cite book|author1=Joseph Prentiss Sanger|author2=Henry Gannett|author3=Walter Francis Willcox|title=Informe sobre el censo de Puerto Rico, 1899, United States. War Dept.

Its agricultural economy that evolved starting in the 1950s has diminished considerably. Most of its agricultural products are imported from other islands in the Caribbean or mainland United States.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century,<ref>Life in Cayey during the first part of the 20th century, and the last part of the 19th century, is detailed in \"Obras Completas\" by Cayey's native son Miguel Melendez Mu\u00f1oz</ref> Cayey was basically an agricultural area of small farmers and local haciendas dedicated to the farming of crops for the local market. During the 1920s and 1930s farmers increasingly lost their land to absentee landowners, mostly American companies, that turned to the cultivation of sugar cane and, to a lesser extent, tobacco for export. In the 1950s and 1960s some manufacturing concerns established plants in Cayey taking advantage of tax incentives offered by \"Operation Bootstrap\", Puerto Rico's industrialization program.\n\nAn industrial base, in 1947 Cayey saw the beginning of industrial entrepreneurship. There were three factories in town, the Caribe Flower Co. in the Palo Seco neighborhood, a Baseball Factory in the Toita neighborhood, and a Uniform Factory in the back of the High School. These factories employed mostly females. By 1950 the men that worked agriculture became excess population and began migrating to the United States or join the military. In 1950 with the approval of Fomento Industrial and Operation Bootstrap there was a boom of light factories in Cayey. The Gordonshire Knitting Mill in the Guayama road had twelve large buildings and ran two shifts with more than 1,000 employees, and the Consolidated Cigar Corporation across from the road from the Reparto Montellano neighborhood operated three shifts employing over 2,500 from Cayey and surrounding towns.\n\nAn education base began in the early to mid-1950s when the Inter-American University opened a branch in Cayey providing teacher training through a night class scheme. In 1967 the University of Puerto Rico opened a campus in the former Henry Barracks Military Reservation, and in the early 1980s El Turabo University, subsidiary of the Ana G. Mendez conglomerate opened a campus in the old Tabaco Factory at the entrance of town. The Interamerican University will be opening a Graduate campus in front of the Plaza (Center of town), and there are conversations with a foreign educational concern to open a technology campus using the buildings left over by the Gordonshire Knitting Mills. There are three major private schools: Radians School, the long established Colegio de Nuestra Senora de la Merced and La Milagrosa School. Cayey's health care base expanded in the mid-1960s with the Mennoite Medical Center and a Municipal\nHospital along with laboratories, and urgent care centers that cater to the poor and the elderly.\n\nWith the construction of the Interstate (route 52), Cayey has evolved into a  \"bedroom community\" with gated housing developments, located just 30 minutes away from San Juan and 45 minutes away from Ponce. With pleasant weather and good private schools, Cayey has become a premium location for the affluent.\n\n==Impact of Henry Barracks Military Reservation==\n\n[[Henry Barracks, Puerto Rico|Henry Barracks]] Military Reservation was a lifeline for the residents of Cayey from 1901 to 1966, when it was declared excess land and passed to the General Services Administration for decommission. The property consisted of 439.92 acres (<ref>FUDS (27 Sept 2006). Project Fact Sheet-August 2005. Jacksonville, FLA: Army Corps of Engineer</ref>). The property was divided into three prominent encampments: the Spanish Camp- Campamento Espa\u00f1ol (15 acres), Camp Henry or Henry Barracks, the Home of the third Battalion of the 65th Inf. Regiment that consisted of 372 acres, and 67 acres the Cayey Naval Radio Station (67 acres) <ref>(Department of the Navy (1915). Map showing boundary lines of the original Spanish Reservation and the present reservation February 7, 1903: Washington, D.C.: Bureau of Yards & Docks, Department of the Navy</ref>). This reservation is situated in the east of the town of Cayey. The Spanish Reservation containing an area of approximately 15 acres, known as Hospital Hill was set apart by Executive Order of June 30, 1903, under an Act of Congress approved on July 7, 1902.<ref>Executive Order of June 30, 1903, under an Act of Congress approved on July 7, 1902</ref> The main army post was located in the northern part of the reservation, initially housing the Puerto Rico Volunteer Infantry Regiment.\n\nThe combined posts had approximately 1200 men who used the resources provided by the town people. Families moved into Punta Brava and Vieques neighborhoods. A laundry, show shop, and other smaller stores were located right outside the gate. By 1906 about 350 civilians had jobs in the two posts (Camp Henry and The Cayey Navy Radio Station).\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Navy submitted a proposal to raise three 620 feet tall masts as part of a global radio communication linkage. In 1916 the Department of the navy approved a budget of $40,000. At the time 300 men were hired to build the facility for a period of two year, the project was completed in 1918 <ref>(Hopper, S.C. (1922) Development of high power radio and its practical applications in the Services of the United States Navy.

All the land held by the Navy included Magazine Hill (known in the community as \"El Polvorin\"), which was taken over by the U. S. Army. The 65th Infantry Regiment remained in the north side of the post. The south side was converted into two 1,000 feet shooting ranges<ref>( Parsons, Inc (2010).

A full complement of maintenance personnel composed of professional, technical, and daily laborers were maintained in the Reservation. The growth of three major housing developments is evidence of the economic impact of the Reservation (Reparto Montellano, El Polvorin, Urbanizaci\u00f3n Aponte)<ref>Personal communication with Maj. Manuel Rivera Garcia (ret.) and Harry Benett, J.D.(August 24, 2014)</ref>\nWhile the all-Puerto Rican 65th Inf regiment would never return to its home base, several other initiatives were undertaken, which had a direct impact on the economic development of the town and the region, one such initiatives was the commissioning of the Caribbean Signal Agency in 1959.  Over the coming years several tenants occupied the lands comprised by the Henry Barracks Military Reservation, among them:\n*\tIn the company size building to the west of the quad, the National Guard had its Officer Training School in 1965 and 1966. It was later moved to Camp Santiago in Salinas.  The golf course was used as a helicopter landing strip.\n*\tYMCA Cuerpos de Paz, and VESPRA (1965\u201368) had an Administration Building, a swimming pool, a golf course and three houses, which housed the majors and their families.<ref>El Mundo, 26 de enero 1965, p.7-8</ref>\n*\tThe Encampment for Citizenship held its 1966 six-week encampment in the  two-company building in the middle of the quad.

Because of its location, Cayey is known for its mountains, its cool weather and its misty mornings, especially in winter. During Spanish colonial rule, Spanish soldiers assigned to Puerto Rico were sent to Cayey. Its cool weather resembled the weather of Spain and soldiers could become acclimated to the tropical weather.

Native from Cayey, Puerto Rico, golden coqu\u00eds have only been found in areas of dense bromeliad growth in the Sierra de Cayey of Puerto Rico between 2,123 and 2,575 feet (647 and 785 meters) above sea level. They get their name from the song the male coquis sing at night. It sounds like \"cokee, cokee\" so that is why they are called coqui in Spanish. The golden coqui is the smallest of the coqui frogs in Puerto Rico. Mature adult coquis are only roughly the size of a dime. Male coquis are more bright yellow where females tend to be more light yellow and brown. The golden coqui is the only frog species in the New World known to give birth to live young. These frogs are known around the whole island of Puerto Rico.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/species/amphibians/coqui_llanero/natural_history.html|title=Natural history|website= Biological Diversity|access-date=2016-05-05}}</ref>\n\n===Barrios===\n[[File:Cayey, Puerto Rico locator map.png|thumb|Subdivisions of Cayey.]]\nLike all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Cayey is subdivided into [[Barrios of Puerto Rico|barrios]].
