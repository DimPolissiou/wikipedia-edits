The next day, he took a razor blade and slashed another girl as he biked past her. He was never caught for either attack. In another incident, he beat and nearly strangled another boy. He relished the power of [[bullying]], and began to stab or slash others.\n\n==Murders==\nIn the city of [[Portland, Maine]], on August 22, 1982, 11-year-old Richard \"Ricky\" Stetson had gone [[jogging]]. When he had not returned by dark, his parents called the police. The next day, a motorist saw the boy's body on the side of the [[Interstate 295 (Maine)|I-295]]. It appeared that an attempt had been made to undress him, and he was stabbed and strangled. A suspect was arrested for the murder, but his teeth did not match a bite mark on Stetson's body, so he was released after a year and a half in custody. No additional leads were presented until January 1984.\n\nDanny Joe Eberle disappeared while delivering the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'' newspaper on Sunday, September 18, 1983, in [[Bellevue, Nebraska]]. His brother, who also delivered the newspaper, had not seen him, but did remember being followed by a white man in a tan car on previous days. It was found that Eberle had delivered just three of the 70 newspapers on his route. At his fourth delivery, his bicycle was discovered along with the rest of the newspapers. There appeared to be no sign of a struggle. Joubert would later describe how he had approached Eberle, drew a knife and then covered the boy's mouth with his hand. He then instructed the boy to follow him and took him to his truck. He then took him to a gravel road outside of town.\n\nAfter a three-day search, his body was finally discovered about four miles (6&nbsp;km) from where his bike had been found. He had been stripped to his underwear, had his feet and hands bound and mouth taped with [[surgical tape]]. He had been stabbed nine times. As a kidnapping, the crime came under the jurisdiction of the [[federal government of the United States]], so the [[FBI]] was called in.\n\nThe investigation followed several leads, including a young man who was arrested for [[child sexual abuse|molesting]] two young boys about a week after the crime. He failed a [[polygraph]] test and had a false [[Wiktionary:alibi|alibi]] but did not fit the [[offender profiling|profile]] the FBI had created for the murderer. He was released due to a lack of evidence. Other known [[Pedophilia|pedophiles]] in the area were also questioned, but the case went cold due to a scarcity of evidence.\n\nOn December 2, Christopher Walden disappeared in [[Papillion, Nebraska]], about three miles (five km) from where Eberle's body was found. Witnesses again said they saw a white man in a tan car. Joubert said that he had driven up to Walden as he walked, showed him the sheath of his knife and ordered him into the car. After driving to some railways lines out of town, he ordered Walden to strip to his underwear, which he did. But then Walden refused to lie down. After a brief struggle, Joubert overpowered and then stabbed him. Joubert cut Walden's throat, so deep that he had almost been [[Decapitation|decapitated]]. Walden's body was found two days later five miles (eight km) from the town. Although the crimes were similar there were differences. Walden had not been bound, had been concealed better, and was thought to have been killed immediately after being abducted.\n\n==Arrest==\nOn January 11, 1984, a preschool teacher in the area of the murders called police to say that she had seen a young man driving in the area. There are conflicting stories as to what occurred \u2014 whether the car was loitering or just driving around. When the driver saw the teacher writing down his license plate, he stopped and threatened her before fleeing. The car was not tan, but was traced and found to be rented by John Joubert, an enlisted radar technician from [[Offutt Air Force Base]]. It turned out that his own car, a tan [[Chevrolet Nova|Nova sedan]], was being repaired.\n\nA [[search warrant]] was issued, and rope consistent with that used to bind Danny Joe Eberle was found in his dorm room. The FBI found that the unusual rope had been made for the [[Military of the United States|United States military]] in [[South Korea]]. Under interrogation, Joubert admitted getting it from the [[scoutmaster]] in the [[troop]] in which he was an assistant.\n\n[[Robert K. Ressler]], the FBI's head profiler at the time, had immediate access to the information about the two boys in Nebraska and worked up a hypothetical description which matched Joubert in every regard.  While presenting the case of the two Nebraska boys to a training class at the FBI academy at [[Quantico]], a police officer from [[Portland, Maine]], noted the similarities to a case in his jurisdiction which took place while Joubert had lived there prior to joining the Air Force. Bitemark comparisons proved that Joubert was responsible for the Maine killing in addition to those in Nebraska.

In 1980, Ressler's investigation revealed that Joubert had slashed a nine-year-old boy and a female teacher in her mid-twenties who both \"had been cut rather badly, and were lucky to be alive.\"<REF NAME=RESSLER/>\n\n==Trials and appeals==\nJoubert then confessed to killing the two boys and, on January 12, was charged with their murders. After initially pleading not guilty, he changed his plea to guilty. There were several [[psychiatry|psychiatric]] evaluations performed on Joubert. One characterised him as having [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] and [[Sadism and Masochism|sadistic tendencies]], and suffering from [[schizoid personality disorder]]. He was found to have  not been [[psychosis|psychotic]] at the time of the crimes. A panel of three judges [[death sentence|sentenced him to death]] for both counts. Joubert was also sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] in [[Maine]] (which did not have the death penalty) in 1990 for the murder of Ricky Stetson after Joubert's teeth were found to match the bite mark.\n\nIn 1995, Joubert filed a writ of [[habeas corpus]] to the [[United States federal courts]] over the death sentences. His lawyers argued that the aggravating factor of \"exceptional depravity\" was [[U.S. Constitution|unconstitutionally]] vague.

They overturned the appeal, saying that he had shown sadistic behavior by [[torture|torturing]] Eberle and Walden.\n\nJoubert was executed on July 17, 1996, by the state of Nebraska via the [[electric chair]].\n\nAs part of appeals on the [[Nebraska Supreme Court]] over whether the electric chair in Nebraska is a [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution|cruel and unusual punishment]], it was revealed that during his execution Joubert incurred a four-inch [[brain]] blister on the top of his head and blistering on both sides of his head above his ears.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Capital punishment in Nebraska]]\n* [[Capital punishment in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n''Footnotes''\n{{reflist}}\n\n''General references''\n*[http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/predators/john_joubert/ Crime Library]\n*[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/article.php?did=1421&scid=64 Nebraska Supreme Court to Hear Electric Chair Challenge] from [[Death Penalty Information Center]]\n*[http://dcs-inmatesearch.ne.gov/Corrections/InmateDisplayServlet?DcsId=35946 Inmate Details: 35946 -- John Joubert].

It is rarely performed in modern Albania, but is found in the northern highlands within the [[Dukagjin highlands]] and [[Mal\u00ebsia]].<ref name=\"roughguide\"/> Other styles of epics also include the K\u00ebng\u00eb trimash or kreshnik\u00ebsh ({{lang-en|Songs of brave men or frontier warriors}}), [[ballad]]s and [[vajtim|maje krahi]]s ({{lang|en|cries}}). Major epics include ''Mujo and Halil'' and ''Halil and Hajrije''.<ref name=\"koco\"/>\n\nSomewhat further south, around [[Debar|Dib\u00ebr]] and [[K\u00ebr\u00e7ov\u00eb]] in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], the lahuta is not used, replaced by the [[\u00e7ifteli]], a two-stringed instrument in which one string is used for the [[Drone (music)|drone]] and one for the [[melody]]. Though men are the traditional performers (exception made for the [[Albanian sworn virgins|sworn virgins]]), women have increasingly been taking part in epic balladry.<ref name=\"roughguide\"/>\n\nAlong with the def, [[\u00e7ifteli]] and sharki are used in a style of dance and pastoral songs. Homemade [[wind instrument]]s are traditionally used by [[shepherd]]s in northern Albania; these include the zumar\u00eb, an unusual kind of clarinet. This shepherds' music is \"melancholic and contemplative\" in tone.<ref name=\"roughguide\"/> The songs called ''maje-krahi'' are another important part of North Albanian folk song; these were originally used by mountaineers to communicate over wide distances, but are now seen as songs. ''Maje-krahi'' songs require the full range of the voice and are full of \"melismatic nuances and falsetto cries\".<ref name=\"koco\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Southern Albania === <!-- This section is linked from [[Pentatonic scale]] -->\n{{further|Albanian iso-polyphony}}\n\n[[File:Fustanela_001.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Folk group from Southern Albania]]\n\nSouthern Albanian music is soft and gentle, and polyphonic in nature with similarities with Greek music on [[polyphonic song of Epirus]]. [[Vlor\u00eb]] in the southwest has perhaps the most unusual vocal traditions in the area, with four distinct parts (''taker'', ''thrower'', ''turner'' and ''drone'') that combine to create a complex and emotionally cathartic melody. Author Kim Burton has described the melodies as \"decorated with [[falsetto]] and [[vibrato]], sometimes interrupted by wild and mournful cries\". This polyphonic vocal music is full of power that \"stems from the tension between the immense emotional weight it carries, rooted in centuries of pride, poverty and oppression, and the strictly formal, almost ritualistic nature of its structure\".<ref name=\"roughguide\"/>\n\nSouth Albania is also known for funeral laments with a chorus and one to two soloists with overlapping, mournful voices. There is a prominent folk love song tradition in the south, in which performers use free rhythm and consonant harmonies, elaborated with [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]] and [[melisma]].<ref name=\"koco\"/>\n\nThe [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] people are known for ensembles consisting of [[violin]]s, [[clarinet]]s, lahut\u00eb (a kind of [[lute]]) and [[Def (instrument)|def]]. [[Eli Fara]], a popular \u00e9migr\u00e9 performer, is from [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]], but the city of [[P\u00ebrmet]] is the center for southern musical innovation, producing artists like Remzi Lela and Laver Bariu. Lela is of special note, having founded a musical dynasty that continues with his descendants playing a part in most of the major music institutions in Tirana.<ref name=\"roughguide\"/>\n\nSouthern instrumental music includes the sedate kaba, an ensemble-driven by a clarinet or violin alongside accordions and llaut\u00ebs. The kaba is an improvised and melancholic style with melodies that Kim Burton describes as \"both fresh and ancient\", \"ornamented with swoops, glides and growls of an almost vocal quality\", exemplifying the \"combination of passion with restraint that is the hallmark of Albanian culture.\"<ref name=\"roughguide\"/>\n\nThe ethnic [[Greeks in Albania|Greek]] inhabitants of the country's southern parts, have a music very similar to the [[music of Epirus]] in Greece.\n\n=== Instrumentation ===\n\n[[File:Lahuta_QKVF.jpg|thumb|160px|A [[Lahuta|lahut\u00eb]] from [[Mirdit\u00eb District|Mirdit\u00eb]] in the north.]]\n\nInstrumentation are an integral part of Albanian folk music, especially in the north.

The music of the north is particularly [[Monophony|monophonic]]. Many of these are about the struggles of the Albanian people and history, the constant Albanian themes of honour, hospitality, treachery and revenge but also [[Skanderbeg]], a legendary 15th century warrior who led the struggle against the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s.<ref name=\"historyofalbmusic\"/> These traditions are a form of [[oral history]] for the Ghegs and also preserve and inculcate moral codes and social values, necessary in a society that, until the early 20th century, relied on blood feuds as its primary means of law enforcement.<ref>Burton, pg. 2 ''Both epic traditions serve as a medium for oral history in what was until quite recently, a pre-literate society... and also preserve and inculcate moral codes and social values. In a culture that retained the blood-feud as its primary means of law enforcement until well into this century such codes were literally matters of life and death. Song was one of the most efficient ways of making sure that each member of the tribe was aware of what obligations he or she was bound by.''</ref>\n\nThe most traditional variety of epic poetry is the [[Albanian Songs of the Frontier Warriors]]. These epic poems are sung, accompanied by a [[lahuta]]. It is rarely performed in modern Albania, but is found in the northern highlands within the [[Dukagjin highlands]] and [[Mal\u00ebsia]].<ref name=\"roughguide\"/> Other styles of epics also include the K\u00ebng\u00eb trimash or kreshnik\u00ebsh ({{lang-en|Songs of brave men or frontier warriors}}), [[ballad]]s and [[vajtim|maje krahi]]s ({{lang|en|cries}}). Major epics include ''Mujo and Halil'' and ''Halil and Hajrije''.<ref name=\"koco\"/>\n\nSomewhat further south, around [[Debar|Dib\u00ebr]] and [[K\u00ebr\u00e7ov\u00eb]] in [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], the lahuta is not used, replaced by the [[\u00e7ifteli]], a two-stringed instrument in which one string is used for the [[Drone (music)|drone]] and one for the [[melody]]. Though men are the traditional performers (exception made for the [[Albanian sworn virgins|sworn virgins]]), women have increasingly been taking part in epic balladry.<ref name=\"roughguide\"/>\n\nAlong with the def, [[\u00e7ifteli]] and sharki are used in a style of dance and pastoral songs. Homemade [[wind instrument]]s are traditionally used by [[shepherd]]s in northern Albania; these include the zumar\u00eb, an unusual kind of clarinet. This shepherds' music is \"melancholic and contemplative\" in tone.<ref name=\"roughguide\"/> The songs called ''maje-krahi'' are another important part of North Albanian folk song; these were originally used by mountaineers to communicate over wide distances, but are now seen as songs. ''Maje-krahi'' songs require the full range of the voice and are full of \"melismatic nuances and falsetto cries\".<ref name=\"koco\"/>\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Southern Albania === <!-- This section is linked from [[Pentatonic scale]] -->\n{{further|Albanian iso-polyphony}}\n\n[[File:Fustanela_001.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Folk group from Southern Albania]]\n\nSouthern Albanian music is soft and gentle, and polyphonic in nature with similarities with Greek music on [[polyphonic song of Epirus]]. [[Vlor\u00eb]] in the southwest has perhaps the most unusual vocal traditions in the area, with four distinct parts (''taker'', ''thrower'', ''turner'' and ''drone'') that combine to create a complex and emotionally cathartic melody. Author Kim Burton has described the melodies as \"decorated with [[falsetto]] and [[vibrato]], sometimes interrupted by wild and mournful cries\". This polyphonic vocal music is full of power that \"stems from the tension between the immense emotional weight it carries, rooted in centuries of pride, poverty and oppression, and the strictly formal, almost ritualistic nature of its structure\".<ref name=\"roughguide\"/>\n\nSouth Albania is also known for funeral laments with a chorus and one to two soloists with overlapping, mournful voices. There is a prominent folk love song tradition in the south, in which performers use free rhythm and consonant harmonies, elaborated with [[ornament (music)|ornamentation]] and [[melisma]].<ref name=\"koco\"/>\n\nThe [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] people are known for ensembles consisting of [[violin]]s, [[clarinet]]s, lahut\u00eb (a kind of [[lute]]) and [[Def (instrument)|def]]. [[Eli Fara]], a popular \u00e9migr\u00e9 performer, is from [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]], but the city of [[P\u00ebrmet]] is the center for southern musical innovation, producing artists like Remzi Lela and Laver Bariu. Lela is of special note, having founded a musical dynasty that continues with his descendants playing a part in most of the major music institutions in Tirana.<ref name=\"roughguide\"/>\n\nSouthern instrumental music includes the sedate kaba, an ensemble-driven by a clarinet or violin alongside accordions and llaut\u00ebs. The kaba is an improvised and melancholic style with melodies that Kim Burton describes as \"both fresh and ancient\", \"ornamented with swoops, glides and growls of an almost vocal quality\", exemplifying the \"combination of passion with restraint that is the hallmark of Albanian culture.\"<ref name=\"roughguide\"/>\n\nThe ethnic [[Greeks in Albania|Greek]] inhabitants of the country's southern parts, have a music very similar to the [[music of Epirus]] in Greece.\n\n=== Instrumentation ===\n\n[[File:Lahuta_QKVF.jpg|thumb|160px|A [[Lahuta|lahut\u00eb]] from [[Mirdit\u00eb District|Mirdit\u00eb]] in the north.]]\n\nInstrumentation are an integral part of Albanian folk music, especially in the north.

Taliban soldiers enter her house and arrest her father for having a foreign education. Parvana and her mother go to the local jail and beg for her father to be freed, but the guards beat them for being so outspoken. Soon after, her mother becomes depressed and will not move from her toshak (thin mattress). Because Parvana's father can no longer work, her family situation becomes dire, as women are not allowed to travel outside the home unless accompanied by a related male in Afghanistan.\n\nParvana meets with Mrs. Weera, a former physical education teacher, who comes to stay with Parvana's family to help Parvana's depressed mother and take charge of the household. Eventually, Parvana's mother begins to feel better and joins Mrs. Weera and a group of women to write the ''Afghanistan National Magazine'', smuggling it to and from Pakistan so it can be published.\n\nHer mother and Mrs. Weera decide to disguise Parvana as a boy by cutting her hair and dressing her in her deceased brother Hossain's old clothes so that she can buy groceries. She also continues her father's business of reading and writing letters for illiterate people. Parvana runs into a girl who she used to go to school with named Shauzia. They start a business partnership. Although they were never close in school, they bond trying to figure out ways to earn more money. They come up with an idea of a portable \"shop\" by using trays to move their wares around. However, they must first obtain money to buy trays. They find a way to earn money by digging up bones from graves.\n\nThroughout the book, Parvana grows closer to her older sister Nooria as well as the woman who appears in the window of a building close to where Parvana works. She throws small gifts onto Parvana's blanket from her window.\n\nNooria announces that she is leaving for [[Mazar-e-Sharif]] to marry a boy and to go to college. She leaves along with her mother and younger siblings, but Parvana stays as she looks like a boy and her appearance will be difficult to explain. Despite being against it at first, Parvana grows to accept her sister's decision.\n\nParvana remains in Kabul with Mrs. Weera. One day after work, she meets a runaway girl from Mazar-e-Sharif who is deeply upset. Parvana leads her home at night, and soon the girl, named Homa, tells them that Mazar-e-Sharif has been captured by the Taliban. Homa's family had been murdered by the Taliban, and she had been extremely lucky to escape. Mrs. Weera gladly takes her in, and Parvana is very worried since the rest of her family is in Mazar.\n\nOne day, Parvana's father returns home, but he is in bad shape. Mrs. Weera, Homa, and Parvana nurse him back to health, and Parvana and her father leave for Mazar, hidden in the back of a truck, to search for their family in the refugee camps. Shauzia, who had been planning to run away from her family so that she would not have to marry, tells Parvana that she will also be leaving with some nomads. Parvana and Shauzia make a pact to meet with each other 20 years later in France, at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]].\n\n==Film adaptation==\n{{Main|The Breadwinner (film)}}\n''The Breadwinner'' was adapted into an animated film, directed by [[Nora Twomey]], that was released on November 17, 2017.<ref>{{cite news|title=Animated Breadwinner eyeing April start|url=http://www.screendaily.com/territories/uk-ireland/animated-breadwinner-eyeing-april-start/5080503.article|accessdate=20 April 2016|publisher=[[ScreenDaily.com]]|date=29 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Portal |Children's literature}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Breadwinner}}\n[[Category:2000 Canadian novels]]\n[[Category:Works about the Taliban]]\n[[Category:Canadian children's novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Afghanistan]]\n[[Category:2000 children's books]]\n[[Category:Refugees and displaced people in fiction]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=August 2015}}\n{{Infobox book\n| name             = The Breadwinner \n| image            = File:The_Breadwinner_Cover.png\n| image_size       = \n| caption          = \n| alt              = \n| author           = [[Deborah Ellis]]\n| cover_artist     = \n| country          = \n| language         = \n| series           = \n| genre            = [[Children's literature]]\n| publisher        = Groundwood Books\n| pub_date         = 2000<!-- {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD|df=y}} -->\n| media_type       =\n| pages            = 176\n| awards           = \n| isbn             = 978-0-88899-416-5\n| oclc             = 47120972\n| dewey            = \n| congress         = \n| followed_by      = [[Parvana's Journey]]\n}}\n\n'''''The Breadwinner''''', also known as '''''Parvana''''',<ref>[https://www.allenandunwin.com/browse/books/childrens/young-adult-fiction/Parvana-Deborah-Ellis-9781865086941 Parvana - Deborah Ellis - 9781865086941 - Allen & Unwin - Australia]</ref> is a children's novel by [[Deborah Ellis]],<ref>[http://www.houseofanansi.com/cw_contributorinfo.aspx?ContribID=52&Name=Deborah+Ellis About Deborah Ellis] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415113519/http://www.houseofanansi.com/cw_contributorinfo.aspx?ContribID=52&Name=Deborah+Ellis |date=2012-04-15 }} houseofanansi.com</ref> first published in 2000.

His initial idea was to sculpt the [[Needles (Black Hills)|Needles]]; however, Gutzon Borglum rejected the Needles because of the poor quality of the granite and strong opposition from the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] (Sioux), who consider the Black Hills to be sacred ground; it was originally included in the [[Great Sioux Reservation]].

The memorial is carved on the northwest margin of the [[Black Elk Peak]] granite [[batholith]] in the Black Hills of South Dakota, so the geologic formations of the heart of the Black Hills region are also evident at Mount Rushmore. The batholith [[magma]] intruded into the pre-existing [[mica]] [[schist]] rocks during the [[Proterozoic]], 1.6 billion years ago.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20080616091103/http://www.nps.gov/archive/moru/pphtml/subenvironmentalfactors13.html Geologic Activity].
