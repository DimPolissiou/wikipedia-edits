These mutants were first isolated within [[bacteriophage]]s ([[Enterobacteria phage T4|T4]] and [[Lambda phage|lambda]]), [[virus]]es that infect the bacteria ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Mutations in viral genes weakened their infectious ability, sometimes creating viruses that were able to infect and grow within only certain varieties of ''E. coli''.\n\n=== ''amber'' mutations (<tt>UAG</tt>) ===\nThey were the first set of [[nonsense mutation]]s to be discovered, isolated by Richard H. Epstein and Charles Steinberg and named after their friend Harris Bernstein (whose last name means \"[[amber]]\" in German).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stahl FW |year=1995 |title=The amber mutants of phage T4 |journal=Genetics |volume=141 |issue=2 |pages=439\u2013442 |pmid=8647382 |pmc=1206745}}</ref>\n\nViruses with amber mutations are characterized by their ability to infect only certain strains of bacteria, known as '''amber suppressors'''. These bacteria carry their own mutation that allows a recovery of function in the mutant viruses. For example, a mutation in the tRNA that recognizes the amber stop codon allows translation to \"read through\" the codon and produce a full-length protein, thereby recovering the normal form of the protein and \"suppressing\" the amber mutation.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/amber-ocher-and-opal-mutations-wog/|title=Amber, Ocher, and Opal Mutations Summary|encyclopedia=World of Genetics|author=Robin Cook|publisher=Gale}}</ref>\nThus, amber mutants are an entire class of virus mutants that can grow in bacteria that contain amber suppressor mutations. Similar suppressors are known for ochre and opal stop codons as well.\n\n=== ''ochre'' mutations (<tt>UAA</tt>) ===\nIt was the second stop codon mutation to be discovered. Given a color name to match the name of amber mutants, [[ochre]] mutant viruses had a similar property in that they recovered infectious ability within certain suppressor strains of bacteria. The set of ochre suppressors was distinct from amber suppressors, so ochre mutants were inferred to correspond to a different nucleotide triplet. Through a series of mutation experiments comparing these mutants with each other and other known amino acid codons, [[Sydney Brenner]] concluded that the amber and ochre mutations corresponded to the nucleotide triplets \"UAG\" and \"UAA\".<ref name=brenner_1965>{{cite journal |pages=994\u20138 |doi=10.1038/206994a0 |pmid=5320272 |title=Genetic Code: The 'Nonsense' Triplets for Chain Termination and their Suppression |year=1965 |last1=Brenner |first1=S. |last2=Stretton |first2=A.

These prematurely terminate translation if the corresponding frame-shift (such as due to a ribosomal RNA slip) occurs before the hidden stop. It is hypothesised that this decreases resource waste on nonfunctional proteins and the production of potential [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxins]]. Researchers at [[Louisiana State University]]  propose the ''[[ambush hypothesis]]'', that hidden stops are selected for. Codons that can form hidden stops are used in genomes more frequently compared to synonymous codons that would otherwise code for the same amino acid. Unstable [[Ribosomal RNA|rRNA]] in an organism correlates with a higher frequency of hidden stops.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=701\u20135 |doi=10.1089/1044549042476910 |title=The Ambush Hypothesis: Hidden Stop Codons Prevent Off-Frame Gene Reading |year=2004 |last1=Seligmann |first1=Herv\u00e9 |last2=Pollock |first2=David D. |journal=DNA and Cell Biology |volume=23 |issue=10 |pmid=15585128}}</ref>\nThis hypothesis however could not be validated with a larger data set.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1\u20138 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-14-418 |title=Ambushing the ambush hypothesis: predicting and evaluating off-frame codon frequencies in Prokaryotic Genomes |year=2013 |last1=Cavalcanti|first1=Andre|last2=Chang |first2=Charlotte H.|last3=Morgens|first3=David W.|journal=BMC Genomics|volume=14 |issue=418 |pmid=23799949 |pmc=3700767}}</ref>\n\nStop-codons and hidden stops together are collectively referred as stop-signals.

These mutants were first isolated within [[bacteriophage]]s ([[Enterobacteria phage T4|T4]] and [[Lambda phage|lambda]]), [[virus]]es that infect the bacteria ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Mutations in viral genes weakened their infectious ability, sometimes creating viruses that were able to infect and grow within only certain varieties of ''E. coli''.\n\n=== ''amber'' mutations (<tt>UAG</tt>) ===\nThey were the first set of [[nonsense mutation]]s to be discovered, isolated by Richard Epstein and Charles Steinberg and named after their friend Harris Bernstein (whose last name means \"[[amber]]\" in German).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Stahl FW |year=1995 |title=The amber mutants of phage T4 |journal=Genetics |volume=141 |issue=2 |pages=439\u2013442 |pmid=8647382 |pmc=1206745}}</ref>\n\nViruses with amber mutations are characterized by their ability to infect only certain strains of bacteria, known as '''amber suppressors'''. These bacteria carry their own mutation that allows a recovery of function in the mutant viruses. For example, a mutation in the tRNA that recognizes the amber stop codon allows translation to \"read through\" the codon and produce a full-length protein, thereby recovering the normal form of the protein and \"suppressing\" the amber mutation.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/amber-ocher-and-opal-mutations-wog/|title=Amber, Ocher, and Opal Mutations Summary|encyclopedia=World of Genetics|author=Robin Cook|publisher=Gale}}</ref>\n:Thus, amber mutants are an entire class of virus mutants that can grow in bacteria that contain amber suppressor mutations.

Given a color name to match the name of amber mutants, [[ochre]] mutant viruses had a similar property in that they recovered infectious ability within certain suppressor strains of bacteria. The set of ochre suppressors was distinct from amber suppressors, so ochre mutants were inferred to correspond to a different nucleotide triplet. Through a series of mutation experiments comparing these mutants with each other and other known amino acid codons, [[Sydney Brenner]] concluded that the amber and ochre mutations corresponded to the nucleotide triplets \"UAG\" and \"UAA\".<ref name=brenner_1965>{{cite journal |pages=994\u20138 |doi=10.1038/206994a0 |pmid=5320272 |title=Genetic Code: The 'Nonsense' Triplets for Chain Termination and their Suppression |year=1965 |last1=Brenner |first1=S. |last2=Stretton |first2=A.

The industry peaked in 1846\u20131852, and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], sent out its last [[whaler]], the ''John R. Mantra'', in 1927. The Whaling industry was engaged with the production of three different raw materials: [[whale oil]], [[sperm oil|spermaceti oil]], and [[baleen|whalebone]]. Whale oil was the result of \"trying-out\" whale blubber by heating in water. It was a primary lubricant for machinery, whose expansion through the Industrial Revolution depended upon before the development of petroleum-based lubricants in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nSpermaceti oil is sourced solely from the head-case of sperm whales. It is processed by pressing the material rather than \"trying-out\". It was more expensive than whale oil, and highly regarded for its use in illumination, by burning the oil on cloth wicks or by processing the material into spermaceti candles, which were expensive and prized for their clean-burning properties. Chemically, spermaceti is more accurately classified as a wax rather than an oil.\n\nWhalebone was baleen plates from the mouths of the baleen whales. Whalebone was commercially used to manufacture materials that required light but strong and thin supports. Women's corsets, umbrella and parasol ribs, crinoline petticoats, buggy whips and collar-stiffeners were commonly made of whalebone. Public records of exports of these three raw materials from the United States date back to 1791, and products of New England whaling represented a major portion of the American GDP for nearly 100 years.<ref>Starbuck, Alexander \"history of the American Whale Fishery, 1989, Castle Books, Secaucus, NJ</ref>\n\n[[Aboriginal whaling]] both pre-dates and post-dates this, as the US uses the exception granted by the [[International Whaling Commission]] which allows some Native Americans to hunt for subsistence or cultural reasons.<ref name=ASW>{{cite web|url=http://iwc.int/aboriginal|title=Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling|publisher=[[International Whaling Commission]]|accessdate=19 March 2014}}</ref> Catches have increased from 18 whales in 1985 to over 70 whales in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Catches Taken: ASW|url=http://iwc.int/table_aboriginal|publisher=International Whaling Commission|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> The latest IWC quota regarding the [[subsistence hunting of the bowhead whale]] allows for up to 336 to be killed in the period 2013\u20132018.<ref name=ASW/> Residents of the United States are also subject to the federal bans against whaling as well.<ref name=\"uswhalingban\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animallaw.info/article/overview-laws-and-regulations-protecting-whales|title=Overview of Laws and Regulations Protecting Whales {{!}} Animal Legal & Historical Center|website=www.animallaw.info|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of whaling}}\n\n=== Native whaling ===\n[[File:Alaska Beluga Harvest 2007.png|thumb|Alaska beluga harvest in 2007]]\nVarious [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes engaged in whaling throughout their history.

Each section had a temporary hut for the five men assigned to that area, with a sixth man standing watch at the mast. Once a whale was sighted, [[whale boat]]s were rowed from the shore, and if the whale was successfully [[harpoon]]ed and lanced to death, it was towed ashore, [[Flensing|flensed]] (i.e., its blubber was cut off), and the blubber rendered into [[whale oil]] in cauldrons known as \"[[try pot]]s.\" Well into the 18th century, even when Nantucket sent out sailing vessels to fish for whales offshore, the whalers would still come to the shore to boil the blubber.\n\nIn 1715, Nantucket had six sloops engaged in whale fishery,{{sfnp|Starbuck|1878|p=20}} and by 1730 it had 25 vessels of 38 to 50 tons involved in the trade.{{sfnp|Starbuck|1878|pp=21\u201322}} Each vessel employed 12 to 13 men, half of them being [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].

At first they only fished off the coast of [[Chile]], but by 1792, the sperm whalers had reached the coast of Peru, and George W. Gardner extended the fishery even further in 1818 when he discovered the \"offshore grounds,\" or the seas between 105\u2013125\u00b0 W and 5\u201310\u00b0 S.{{sfnp|Scammon|1874|p=211}} In 1820, the first New England whaleship, the {{ship||Maro|whaleship|2}}, under Captain Joseph Allen, hunted sperm whales on the Japanese ground, midway between Japan and Hawaii.{{sfnp|Scammon|1874|p=212}} The previous year the first New England whalers visited the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands]], and subsequently these islands were used to obtain fresh fruits, vegetables, and more crew, as well as to repair any damages sustained to the ship.\n\nIn 1829 the New England fleet numbered 203 sail; in five years time it more than doubled to 421 vessels,{{sfnp|Tower|1907|p=50}} and by 1840 it stood at 552 ships, barks, brigs, and schooners.{{sfnp|Tower|1907|p=51}} The peak was reached in 1846, when 736 vessels were registered under the American flag. From 1846 to 1851, the trade averaged some 638 vessels,{{sfnp|Bockstoce|1986|p=94}} with the majority coming from such ports as [[New Bedford]], [[Nantucket]], [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], and [[Sag Harbor|Sag Harbor, New York]]. By far the largest number sailed from New Bedford, but Nantucket continued to host a fleet, even when they needed to use \"camels,\" or floating drydocks, to get over the sandbar that formed at the mouth of the harbor.\n\n[[Thomas Welcome Roys]], in the Sag Harbor [[Bark (ship)|bark]] ''Superior'', sailed through the [[Bering Strait]] on 23 July 1848, and discovered an abundance of \"new fangled monsters,\" or later to be known as [[bowhead whale]]s.{{sfnp|Bockstoce|1986|p=21}} The following season fifty whalers\u201446 from New England, two from Germany, and two from France\u2014sailed to the [[Bering Strait]] region on the report from this single ship.{{sfnp|Bockstoce|1986|p=93}} In terms of number of vessels and whales killed, the peak was reached in 1852, when 220 ships killed 2,682 bowheads.{{sfnp|Bockstoce|1986|p=97}} Catches declined, and the fleet shifted to the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in 1853\u20131854. Whaling there peaked in 1855\u20131857, and once that area began to decline in 1858\u20131860, they returned to the Bering Strait region.\n\n===Peak===\n[[File:Whaling.png|thumb|Whales caught by country and year, 1955\u20132016]]\n{{See also|Subsistence hunting of the bowhead whale}}\nThe American whaling fleet, after steadily growing for 50 years, reached its all-time peak of 199 ships in 1858. Just two years later, in 1860, just before the Civil War, the fleet had dropped to 167 ships. The war cut into whaling temporarily, but only 105 whaling ships returned to sea in 1866, the first full year of peace, and that number dwindled until only 39 American ships set out to hunt whales in 1876.<ref>US Bureau of the Census, 1960, ''Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1957'', p.445.</ref>\n\nDuring the winter, some of these same vessels would make their way to the lagoons of [[Baja California]]. The peak began in 1855, commencing the period of lagoon whaling known as the \"bonanza period\", when whaleboats were crisscrossing through the lagoons, being pulled by enraged whales, passing by calves that had lost their mothers and other ships' crews hunting whales. Less than twenty years later, in 1874, the lagoon fishery was abandoned entirely, due to several years of poor catches.\n\nSeveral New England ships were lost during the 1860s and 1870s. During the [[American Civil War]], Confederate raiders such as the {{ship|CSS|Shenandoah||2}}, {{ship|CSS|Alabama||2}}, and {{ship|CSS|Florida||2}} captured or burned 46 ships, while the United States purchased forty of the fleet's oldest hulls. Known as the [[Stone Fleet]], these ships were purchased to sink in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] harbors in a failed attempt to blockade those ports. Thirty-three of the 40 whalers that comprised the [[Arctic]] fleet were lost near Point Belcher and Wainwright Inlet in the [[Whaling Disaster of 1871]],<ref name=\"Bockstoce 1986, p.344\">{{harvp|Bockstoce|1986|p=344}}</ref> while another 12 ships were lost in 1876.<ref name=\"Bockstoce 1986, p.344\"/>\n\n[[File:An Old Whaler Hove Down For Repairs, Near New Bedford.jpg|thumb|An old whaler [[hove down]] for repairs near New Bedford, 1882 by [[Frederick Schiller Cozzens]]]]\nThe use of steam, the high prices for [[whalebone]], and the proximity of the whaling grounds brought the rise of [[San Francisco]] as a dominant whaling port in the 1880s.

Boston left the trade in 1903 and only New Bedford continued on into the trade, sending out its last whaler, the ''John R. Mantra'', in 1927.{{sfnp|Mawar|1999|pp=339\u2013340}}\n\nWhile whaling came to an end on the east coast in the early 20th-century, it lingered and even rebounded briefly on the west coast. A small shore-based whaling operation existed in San Francisco through the early 1960s. During the early 1960s, a small whaling fishery was developed naer [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]], [[Oregon]] as a collaboration between a local fishing family and the processing firm BioProducts. A single-ship operation was successful during the early 1960s, making a profit through sales of meat to local mink farms and whale oil to [[NASA]]. As synthetic oils came onto the markets, the demand for scientific grade whale oil was diminished and the operation was came to a close in 1963.<ref>Lloyd, On the Northwest: Commercial Whaling in the Pacific Northwest, 1988</ref> The whale processor has since refocused their operations on processing of other seafood oils and continues to operate today as BioOregon Protein.\n\n== The romance of whaling ==\n[[File:Whaler posed with harpoon, Alaska, ca 1915 (COBB 50).jpeg|thumb|Alaskan whaler standing with a harpoon, 1915]]\nAccording to Frances Diane Robotti,{{sfnp|Robotti|1952}} there were three types of whalers: those who hoped to own their own whaleship someday, those who were seeking adventure, and those who were running from something on shore. Generally only those who hoped to make a career of whaling went out more than once.\n\nSince a whaler's pay was based on his \"lay\", or share of the catch, he sometimes returned from a long voyage to find himself paid next to nothing, or even owing money to his employers. Even a bonanza voyage paid the ordinary crewman less than if he had served in the merchant fleet. The lay system was a gamble and sailors were never ensured decent wages. Richard Boyenton of the \"Bengal\" only earned six and a quarter cents after five months at sea, but occasionally sailors got lucky and brought home a significant amount of money after just a couple of voyages. More commonly sailors would earn very little after years at sea. Ships that returned to port less than full of oil were called \"broken voyages\" while ships that came home overflowing were praised. The ''Loper'' returned to Nantucket with its deck and hold chock full of casks of oil while ships like the ''Brewster'' prioritized oil so significantly that they threw food and water overboard to make more room for oil.\n\nThere was a romance to whaling; going to sea was a young man's adventure, particularly when he wound up in the South Sea paradises of the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]], [[Tahiti]], or the [[Marquesas Islands]], where a young American man might find himself surrounded by young women ready to freely offer him their charms, something he was unlikely to experience at home. Many, including [[Herman Melville]], jumped ship, apparently without repercussions. After his romantic interlude among the Typees on [[Nuku Hiva]] in the Marquesas, Melville joined another whaler that took him to Hawaii, from where he sailed for home as a crewman on {{USS|United States|1797|6}}. Along with [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and others, Melville cultivated the image of the Pacific islands as romantic paradises. The [[California Gold Rush]] offered young men an adventure to California, for free if they signed on as a whaler. Many whalers (including captains and officers) abandoned the crew in San Francisco there, leaving abundant ships deserted in the bay.{{sfnp|Mawar|1999|p=244}}\n \n== Scrimshaw art ==\n[[File:Scrimshaw.jpg|thumb|Detail on a piece in the [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] Scrimshaw Museum]]\nA large number of crewmen on American, British, and other countries vessels that participated in whaling in the 19th century created [[scrimshaw]]. Scrimshaw is the practice of drawing on whale teeth or other forms of [[ivory]] with various tools, typically sailor's knives or other sharp instruments. These images were then coated with ink so that the drawing would appear more noticeable on the whale tooth. It is believed that some instruments used by sailors to perform scrimshaw included surgical tools, as with the work done by whaling surgeon William Lewis Roderick. Other forms of ivory included a whale's panbone, [[walrus ivory]], and elephant ivory. Of course, the most common scrimshaw during the whaling period of the 19th century was made from whale parts.\n\nOther forms of scrimshaw included whalebone fids (rope splicer), bodkins (needle), swifts (yarn holding equipment) and sailors' canes. The time when most scrimshaw in the 19th century was produced coincided with the heyday of the whaling industry which occurred between 1840\u20131860. More than 95% of all antique scrimshaw whale teeth known were done by anonymous artists. Some of the better known antique scrimshaw artists include Frederick Myrick and Edward Burdett, who were two of the first scrimshanders to ever sign and date their work. Several museums now house outstanding collections of antique scrimshaw and one of the best being the [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] in Massachusetts.<ref>\"Antique Scrimshaw and Whaling\" here [http://www.antiquescrimshaw.org/index.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001204013/http://www.antiquescrimshaw.org/index.htm |date=October 1, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== C20 whaling ==\nWhaling stations operated in Alaska and on the Canadian west coast.

The industry peaked in 1846\u20131852, and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]], sent out its last [[whaler]], the ''John R. Mantra'', in 1927. The Whaling industry was engaged with the production of three different raw materials: [[whale oil]], [[sperm oil|spermaceti oil]], and [[baleen|whalebone]]. Whale oil was the result of \"trying-out\" whale blubber by heating in water. It was a primary lubricant for machinery, whose expansion through the Industrial Revolution depended upon before the development of petroleum-based lubricants in the second half of the 19th century.\n\nSpermaceti oil is sourced solely from the head-case of sperm whales. It is processed by pressing the material rather than \"trying-out\". It was more expensive than whale oil, and highly regarded for its use in illumination, by burning the oil on cloth wicks or by processing the material into spermaceti candles, which were expensive and prized for their clean-burning properties. Chemically, spermaceti is more accurately classified as a wax rather than an oil.\n\nWhalebone was baleen plates from the mouths of the baleen whales. Whalebone was commercially used to manufacture materials that required light but strong and thin supports. Women's corsets, umbrella and parasol ribs, crinoline petticoats, buggy whips and collar-stiffeners were commonly made of whalebone. Public records of exports of these three raw materials from the United States date back to 1791, and products of New England whaling represented a major portion of the American GDP for nearly 100 years.<ref>Starbuck, Alexander \"history of the American Whale Fishery, 1989, Castle Books, Secaucus, NJ</ref>\n\n[[Aboriginal whaling]] both pre-dates and post-dates this, as the US uses the exception granted by the [[International Whaling Commission]] which allows some Native Americans to hunt for subsistence or cultural reasons.<ref name=ASW>{{cite web|url=http://iwc.int/aboriginal|title=Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling|publisher=[[International Whaling Commission]]|accessdate=19 March 2014}}</ref> Catches have increased from 18 whales in 1985 to over 70 whales in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Catches Taken: ASW|url=http://iwc.int/table_aboriginal|publisher=International Whaling Commission|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> The latest IWC quota regarding the [[subsistence hunting of the bowhead whale]] allows for up to 336 to be killed in the period 2013\u20132018.<ref name=ASW/> Residents of the United States are also subject to the federal bans against whaling as well.<ref name=\"uswhalingban\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.animallaw.info/article/overview-laws-and-regulations-protecting-whales|title=Overview of Laws and Regulations Protecting Whales {{!}} Animal Legal & Historical Center|website=www.animallaw.info|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of whaling}}\n\n=== Native whaling ===\n[[File:Alaska Beluga Harvest 2007.png|thumb|Alaska beluga harvest in 2007]]\nVarious [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribes engaged in whaling throughout their history.

Once a whale was sighted, [[whale boat]]s were rowed from the shore, and if the whale was successfully [[harpoon]]ed and lanced to death, it was towed ashore, [[Flensing|flensed]] (i.e., its blubber was cut off), and the blubber rendered into [[whale oil]] in cauldrons known as \"[[try pot]]s.\" Well into the 18th century, even when Nantucket sent out sailing vessels to fish for whales offshore, the whalers would still come to the shore to boil the blubber.\n\nIn 1715, Nantucket had six sloops engaged in whale fishery,{{sfnp|Starbuck|1878|p=20}} and by 1730 it had 25 vessels of 38 to 50 tons involved in the trade.{{sfnp|Starbuck|1878|pp=21\u201322}} Each vessel employed 12 to 13 men, half of them being [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. At times the entire crew, with the exception of the captain, might be natives.{{sfnp|Scammon|1874|p=204}} They had two whaleboats, one held in reserve should the other be damaged by a whale. By 1732, the first New England whalers had reached the [[Davis Strait]] fishery, between [[Greenland]] and [[Baffin Island]].{{sfnp|Starbuck|1878|p=168}} The fishery slowly began to expand, with whalers visiting the coast of [[West Africa]] in 1763, the [[Azores]] in 1765, the coast of Brazil in 1773, and the [[Falklands]] in 1774. It wasn't until the 19th century that whaling really became an industry.\n\n=== Expansion ===\nIn 1768, the fishery began a huge expansion that was to culminate just prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]].{{sfnp|Tower|1907|p=36}} Between 1771 and 1775 the [[Massachusetts]] ports alone employed an average of 183 vessels in the northern fishery, and 121 in the southern.{{sfnp|Starbuck|1878|p=57}} There was during the American Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars a complete shutdown of the industry, its peak growth came after the American Revolution.\n\nThe first New England whalers rounded [[Cape Horn]] in 1791, entering the [[Pacific Ocean]] to hunt the cachalot or [[sperm whale]]. At first they only fished off the coast of [[Chile]], but by 1792, the sperm whalers had reached the coast of Peru, and George W. Gardner extended the fishery even further in 1818 when he discovered the \"offshore grounds,\" or the seas between 105\u2013125\u00b0 W and 5\u201310\u00b0 S.{{sfnp|Scammon|1874|p=211}} In 1820, the first New England whaleship, the {{ship||Maro|whaleship|2}}, under Captain Joseph Allen, hunted sperm whales on the Japanese ground, midway between Japan and Hawaii.{{sfnp|Scammon|1874|p=212}} The previous year the first New England whalers visited the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islands]], and subsequently these islands were used to obtain fresh fruits, vegetables, and more crew, as well as to repair any damages sustained to the ship.\n\nIn 1829 the New England fleet numbered 203 sail; in five years time it more than doubled to 421 vessels,{{sfnp|Tower|1907|p=50}} and by 1840 it stood at 552 ships, barks, brigs, and schooners.{{sfnp|Tower|1907|p=51}} The peak was reached in 1846, when 736 vessels were registered under the American flag. From 1846 to 1851, the trade averaged some 638 vessels,{{sfnp|Bockstoce|1986|p=94}} with the majority coming from such ports as [[New Bedford]], [[Nantucket]], [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], and [[Sag Harbor|Sag Harbor, New York]]. By far the largest number sailed from New Bedford, but Nantucket continued to host a fleet, even when they needed to use \"camels,\" or floating drydocks, to get over the sandbar that formed at the mouth of the harbor.\n\n[[Thomas Welcome Roys]], in the Sag Harbor [[Bark (ship)|bark]] ''Superior'', sailed through the [[Bering Strait]] on 23 July 1848, and discovered an abundance of \"new fangled monsters,\" or later to be known as [[bowhead whale]]s.{{sfnp|Bockstoce|1986|p=21}} The following season fifty whalers\u201446 from New England, two from Germany, and two from France\u2014sailed to the [[Bering Strait]] region on the report from this single ship.{{sfnp|Bockstoce|1986|p=93}} In terms of number of vessels and whales killed, the peak was reached in 1852, when 220 ships killed 2,682 bowheads.{{sfnp|Bockstoce|1986|p=97}} Catches declined, and the fleet shifted to the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in 1853\u20131854. Whaling there peaked in 1855\u20131857, and once that area began to decline in 1858\u20131860, they returned to the Bering Strait region.\n\n===Peak===\n[[File:Whaling.png|thumb|Whales caught by country and year, 1955\u20132016]]\n{{See also|Subsistence hunting of the bowhead whale}}\nThe American whaling fleet, after steadily growing for 50 years, reached its all-time peak of 199 ships in 1858. Just two years later, in 1860, just before the Civil War, the fleet had dropped to 167 ships. The war cut into whaling temporarily, but only 105 whaling ships returned to sea in 1866, the first full year of peace, and that number dwindled until only 39 American ships set out to hunt whales in 1876.<ref>US Bureau of the Census, 1960, ''Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1957'', p.445.</ref>\n\nDuring the winter, some of these same vessels would make their way to the lagoons of [[Baja California]]. The peak began in 1855, commencing the period of lagoon whaling known as the \"bonanza period\", when whaleboats were crisscrossing through the lagoons, being pulled by enraged whales, passing by calves that had lost their mothers and other ships' crews hunting whales. Less than twenty years later, in 1874, the lagoon fishery was abandoned entirely, due to several years of poor catches.\n\nSeveral New England ships were lost during the 1860s and 1870s. During the [[American Civil War]], Confederate raiders such as the {{ship|CSS|Shenandoah||2}}, {{ship|CSS|Alabama||2}}, and {{ship|CSS|Florida||2}} captured or burned 46 ships, while the United States purchased forty of the fleet's oldest hulls. Known as the [[Stone Fleet]], these ships were purchased to sink in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] harbors in a failed attempt to blockade those ports. Thirty-three of the 40 whalers that comprised the [[Arctic]] fleet were lost near Point Belcher and Wainwright Inlet in the [[Whaling Disaster of 1871]],<ref name=\"Bockstoce 1986, p.344\">{{harvp|Bockstoce|1986|p=344}}</ref> while another 12 ships were lost in 1876.<ref name=\"Bockstoce 1986, p.344\"/>\n\n[[File:An Old Whaler Hove Down For Repairs, Near New Bedford.jpg|thumb|An old whaler [[hove down]] for repairs near New Bedford, 1882 by [[Frederick Schiller Cozzens]]]]\nThe use of steam, the high prices for [[whalebone]], and the proximity of the whaling grounds brought the rise of [[San Francisco]] as a dominant whaling port in the 1880s.

Boston left the trade in 1903 and only New Bedford continued on into the trade, sending out its last whaler, the ''John R. Mantra'', in 1927.{{sfnp|Mawar|1999|pp=339\u2013340}}\n\nWhile whaling came to an end on the east coast in the early 20th-century, it lingered and even rebounded briefly on the west coast. A small shore-based whaling operation existed in San Francisco through the early 1960s. During the early 1960s, a small whaling fishery was developed naer [[Astoria, Oregon|Astoria]], [[Oregon]] as a collaboration between a local fishing family and the processing firm BioProducts. A single-ship operation was successful during the early 1960s, making a profit through sales of meat to local mink farms and whale oil to [[NASA]]. As synthetic oils came onto the markets, the demand for scientific grade whale oil was diminished and the operation was came to a close in 1963.<ref>Lloyd, On the Northwest: Commercial Whaling in the Pacific Northwest, 1988</ref> The whale processor has since refocused their operations on processing of other seafood oils and continues to operate today as BioOregon Protein.\n\n== The romance of whaling ==\n[[File:Whaler posed with harpoon, Alaska, ca 1915 (COBB 50).jpeg|thumb|Alaskan whaler standing with a harpoon, 1915]]\nAccording to Frances Diane Robotti,{{sfnp|Robotti|1952}} there were three types of whalers: those who hoped to own their own whaleship someday, those who were seeking adventure, and those who were running from something on shore. Generally only those who hoped to make a career of whaling went out more than once.\n\nSince a whaler's pay was based on his \"lay\", or share of the catch, he sometimes returned from a long voyage to find himself paid next to nothing, or even owing money to his employers. Even a bonanza voyage paid the ordinary crewman less than if he had served in the merchant fleet. The lay system was a gamble and sailors were never ensured decent wages. Richard Boyenton of the \"Bengal\" only earned six and a quarter cents after five months at sea, but occasionally sailors got lucky and brought home a significant amount of money after just a couple of voyages. More commonly sailors would earn very little after years at sea. Ships that returned to port less than full of oil were called \"broken voyages\" while ships that came home overflowing were praised. The ''Loper'' returned to Nantucket with its deck and hold chock full of casks of oil while ships like the ''Brewster'' prioritized oil so significantly that they threw food and water overboard to make more room for oil.\n\nThere was a romance to whaling; going to sea was a young man's adventure, particularly when he wound up in the South Sea paradises of the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]], [[Tahiti]], or the [[Marquesas Islands]], where a young American man might find himself surrounded by young women ready to freely offer him their charms, something he was unlikely to experience at home. Many, including [[Herman Melville]], jumped ship, apparently without repercussions. After his romantic interlude among the Typees on [[Nuku Hiva]] in the Marquesas, Melville joined another whaler that took him to Hawaii, from where he sailed for home as a crewman on {{USS|United States|1797|6}}. Along with [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], [[Paul Gauguin]], and others, Melville cultivated the image of the Pacific islands as romantic paradises. The [[California Gold Rush]] offered young men an adventure to California, for free if they signed on as a whaler. Many whalers (including captains and officers) abandoned the crew in San Francisco there, leaving abundant ships deserted in the bay.{{sfnp|Mawar|1999|p=244}}\n \n== Scrimshaw art ==\n[[File:Scrimshaw.jpg|thumb|Detail on a piece in the [[Horta (Azores)|Horta]] Scrimshaw Museum]]\nA large number of crewmen on American, British, and other countries vessels that participated in whaling in the 19th century created [[scrimshaw]]. Scrimshaw is the practice of drawing on whale teeth or other forms of [[ivory]] with various tools, typically sailor's knives or other sharp instruments. These images were then coated with ink so that the drawing would appear more noticeable on the whale tooth. It is believed that some instruments used by sailors to perform scrimshaw included surgical tools, as with the work done by whaling surgeon William Lewis Roderick. Other forms of ivory included a whale's panbone, [[walrus ivory]], and elephant ivory. Of course, the most common scrimshaw during the whaling period of the 19th century was made from whale parts.\n\nOther forms of scrimshaw included whalebone fids (rope splicer), bodkins (needle), swifts (yarn holding equipment) and sailors' canes. The time when most scrimshaw in the 19th century was produced coincided with the heyday of the whaling industry which occurred between 1840\u20131860. More than 95% of all antique scrimshaw whale teeth known were done by anonymous artists. Some of the better known antique scrimshaw artists include Frederick Myrick and Edward Burdett, who were two of the first scrimshanders to ever sign and date their work. Several museums now house outstanding collections of antique scrimshaw and one of the best being the [[New Bedford Whaling Museum]] in Massachusetts.<ref>\"Antique Scrimshaw and Whaling\" here [http://www.antiquescrimshaw.org/index.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001204013/http://www.antiquescrimshaw.org/index.htm |date=October 1, 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== C20 whaling ==\nWhaling stations operated in Alaska and on the Canadian west coast.
