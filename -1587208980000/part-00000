Although it has gained significant fame and popularity in Japan's neighbouring countries, political interpretations of the series has caused controversies in China and South Korea.<!--This refers to South Korean media claiming it has a \"militaristic message\" and death threats that the author received for modelling a character after an Imperial Japanese Army general, both sourced in the reception section.-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\nShort people eat tall people.\nThe nudists(Titans) have broken free.\nGiant Naked men run through streets.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{Long plot|section|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Setting===\nAccording to lore, over 2,000 years prior to the present day, a young woman named Ymir Fritz came into contact and made a deal with the \u201c[[Devil]] of All Earth\", becoming the first of humanoid giants, and imbued with special powers. These creatures later came to be known as {{nihongo4|[[List of Attack on Titan characters#Titans|Titans]]|\u5de8\u4eba|Kyojin}}. Her powers were used by her King to establish the Empire of Eldia and, in doing so, crushed the rival nation of Marley. When she died, her titan abilities were passed on, eventually manifesting into Nine individual forms; each with their own special traits. The power of the titans was kept by the royal Fritz family for centuries.\n\nOne century before the events of the main storyline the 145th Eldian King, Karl Fritz, became disillusioned by the powers his ancestors had granted him and guilt-ridden over the destructive path the Eldian monarchy had taken. He orchestrated his nation\u2019s downfall, allowing the nation of Marley to rise up in rebellion. In the process, Eight of the Nine Titan powers were stolen by Marley. Possessing the Ninth Titan power, the power of the Founding Titan, Fritz took a handful of his people across the sea to the island of Paradis to begin a new, peaceful nation. He created millions of Colossal Titans to be used as part of the construction of three [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain walls]], each one named after one of Ymir Fritz\u2019s three daughters: the outermost being {{nihongo4|Wall Maria|\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30de\u30ea\u30a2|W\u014dru Maria}}; the middle {{nihongo4|Wall Rose|\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30ed\u30fc\u30bc|W\u014dru R\u014dze|sometimes pronounced like ''[[ros\u00e9]]''}} and the innermost {{nihongo4|Wall Sheena|\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b7\u30fc\u30ca|W\u014dru Sh\u012bna|alt. \"Wall Sina\"}} which housed the Royal family and was populated by the wealthy and elite. Once the walls were complete, Fritz gave the outside world an ultimatum: should war be declared on Paradis, he would release the titans within the walls to flatten the earth. This, however, was a bluff since Fritz revealed to his family that he had renounced all war. If Marley eventually became powerful enough to overthrow Paradis, then he would accept that. He used his Founding Titan powers to create a blood pact which would instill this ideology in any royal family member who inherited his titan, even if they disagreed with it before. Meanwhile, Eldians who remained within Marley as second class citizens were treated poorly, and any form of dissent or disobedience was punishable by exile to Paradis: they were injected with raw titan spinal fluid, turning them into mindless, man-eating \u2018Pure\u2019 Titans which would eventually find their way to King Fritz\u2019s walls.\n\nKarl Fritz also used his titan power to erase the memories of most of his Eldian citizens, with those unaffected either bribed into nobility or made into outcasts like the Ackerman family and the Asian clan. The power of the titans was hidden from common knowledge and fear of them was instilled in the Eldian citizens to prevent them from venturing outside the walls. As such, the Eldians on Paradis believed firmly that they were the last of the human race, forced into confinement by the ravenous Pure Titans. Unlike titans with powers, such as the Founding Titan, Pure Titans have no awareness and function purely on the instinct to consume humans; the idea being that, if they were to consume a human containing a power of one of the Nine titans, they would inherit that power and become a sentient human again. Unaware of this information the Eldians formed a three branch military to protect its citizens: the {{Nihongo4|[[List of Attack on Titan characters#Military Police Brigade|Military Police Brigade]]|\u61b2\u5175\u56e3|Kenpeidan}} who reside primarily within Wall Sina and protect the Royal Family and elite, living a relaxed lifestyle which has resulted in instances of fraud, corruption, and political subterfuge; the {{Nihongo4|[[List of Attack on Titan characters#Garrison Regiment|Garrison Regiment]]|\u99d0\u5c6f\u5175\u56e3|Ch\u016bton Heidan}} who guard the walls and the civilian populace, though are known to act lackadaisically since the walls themselves do much of the protecting against titans; and the {{nihongo4|[[List of Attack on Titan characters#Survey Corps|Survey Corps]]|\u8abf\u67fb\u5175\u56e3|Ch\u014dsa Heidan}} who trek into titan territory outside the walls in order to study and cull them and attempt to reclaim land. The Survey Corps is heavily derided within society because of their high casualty rate and little to no progress in their objectives. All soldiers use a grappling and tethering system called {{nihongo4|Vertical Maneuvering Equipment|\u7acb\u4f53\u6a5f\u52d5\u88c5\u7f6e|Rittai Kid\u014d S\u014dchi}} that allows them to jump onto, and swing from, any tall structures using gas canisters to propel themselves forward, though the equipment is useless on flat ground. A box containing spare blades for their dual swords hangs beside each thigh, and the blades themselves are flexible and easily detachable, used solely for cutting down titans. Over the past 100 years the Survey Corp has compiled characteristics of the Pure Titans to aid them in battle. A titan's skin is tough and difficult to penetrate and they regenerate quickly from any injuries, save for a spot on the [[nape]] of the neck which is the one and only place where a soldier can make a fatal strike.\n\n===Plot===\n{{See also|List of Attack on Titan characters}}\nEren Yeager(Jaeger in the anime adaptation) lives with Mikasa Ackerman and best friend Armin Arlert in the town of Shiganshina adjacent to Wall Maria, outermost of three circular walls protecting humanity from man-eating Titans said to have killed all other humans one hundred years prior. When Shiganshina and Wall Maria are breached by the Colossal(Colossus in the manga) and Armoured Titans, invading Titans force humanity to retreat behind Wall Rose. After a titan devours his mother and his father disappears, a vengeful Eren enlists in the military along with Mikasa and Armin.\n\nFive years later, the three cadet graduates are positioned in Trost district adjacent to Wall Rose when the Colossal Titan breaches the city gate. During the subsequent Titan invasion, Eren is eaten but survives after creating and controlling a Titan's body. Previously unaware of his abilities, Eren suspects his father's basement holds answers. Although Eren seals Trost's breach using his Titan power, many consider him a potential threat and a military tribunal assigns him to the Survey Corps under Captain Levi's watch, with many of Eren's friends following suit.\n\nDuring an expedition to Shiganshina, a Female Titan unsuccessfully attempts to capture Eren. Despite the expedition's failure, Armin deduces the Female Titan's identity as a fellow cadet from their class named Annie Leonhart with abilities akin to Eren's. Annie encases herself in crystal following her capture in Stohess, collateral damage revealing the walls are formed from massive Titans within them. Following the mysterious appearance of the Beast Titan behind Wall Rose, Eren is kidnapped by his fellow cadets Reiner Braun and Bertolt Hoover, exposed as the Titans who compromised Wall Maria. They and Annie were dispatched by an unknown party to capture the \"Coordinate\", an ability to control titans which they suspect Eren possesses. Eren manifests this power during an encounter with the titan who killed his mother, allowing him and the pursuing Survey Corps to escape. The Corps theorize that Titans were originally humans, and may regain their human form by consuming an individual with Titan power, acquiring those abilities for themselves.\n\nPersecuted by the military police, the Survey Corps discover the royal government seats a figurehead king and suppresses technological advancement. Eren's comrade Historia Reiss learns she is the illegitimate child of the walls' true ruler Rod Reiss, who has her and Eren kidnapped. Rod reveals his ancestor created the walls using the power of the Founding Titan, intending to confine humanity and erasing their memories. The Reiss family passed down the King's power and will until Eren's father Grisha stole the power of the Founding Titan during Wall Maria's fall, and passed its power to Eren by turning him into a Titan via an injection and allowing himself to be devoured. Rod intends for Historia to become a Titan and eat Eren to reclaim the Reiss family's power, but Historia refuses and aids the Survey Corps' rescue of Eren and rebellion against the monarchy. Following Rod's defeat, the military assumes power and crowns Historia queen. Although Eren's lack of royal ancestry inhibits the Founding Titan's power, he obtains an ability to create permanent structures, which the Survey Corps use in their next expedition to seal the breach in Wall Maria. However, the group are ambushed by Reiner, Bertolt and their superior Zeke, the Beast Titan. The Survey Corps subdue Bertolt and drive off the other enemy Titans, but most of the expedition members are killed during the battle with Armin and Commander Erwin Smith left mortally wounded. Levi, armed with a single injection taken from Rod, decides to save Armin over Erwin. Armin becomes a Titan, devours Bertolt and acquires the Colossal Titan's powers.\n\nBefore returning home, the survivors recover Grisha's memoirs from the Yeagers' basement. His writings state that human civilization is actually thriving and the people of the walls are members of the Eldian race, whose common ancestor Ymir Fritz acquired the Power of the Titans, granting her progeny the unique potential to become Titans and inherit nine Titan powers. Ymir's descendants dominated world history for centuries until 100 years prior to the series' beginning, when the 145th Eldian King retreated to Paradis Island and established the three walls with the Founding Titan, threatening to retaliate with the titans comprising the walls should his peace be disturbed. The nation of Marley conquered and quarantined the remaining Eldians, passing the seven captured Titan Powers to indoctrinated Eldian \"Warriors\" for furthering Marley's national interests. Grisha conspired with other Eldian dissidents to acquire the Founding Titan before Marley and free their people but was outed by his son Zeke Yeager, Eren's half-brother and the future Beast Titan, and sentenced to life as a mindless Titan wandering Paradis. However, Grisha was saved by his movement's informant, who entrusted his Titan power and mission to Grisha and sent him to infiltrate the walls and recover the Founding Titan. Eren learns that despite his lack of royal ancestry, he may be able to use the Founding Titan's full \"Coordinate\" power through physical contact with a titan of royal blood.\n\nFour years after the Battle of Shiganshina, a conflict between Marley and a combined offensive sees the emergence of conventional weapons capable of defeating Titans. Fearing the military obsolescence of Eldians will lead to their genocide, the Warriors work with the influential Tybur family, retainers of the War Hammer Titan, to recruit global support for a resumed offensive on Paradis. Eren, having infiltrated Marley on his own, assassinates Willy Tybur as he declares war on Paradis before international delegates. With the aid of the Survey Corps in the ensuing battle, Eren steals the War Hammer Titan's power and Zeke defects to Paradis. Eren and the Survey Corps return to Paradis with Zeke via airship, but Eren's friend Sasha is killed by Gabi Braun, Warrior candidate and Reiner's cousin who stowed away along with her friend Falco Grice.\n\nFlashbacks depict the preceding four years on Paradis, during which Zeke's followers arrived and introduced Paradis to modern technology and the friendly nation of Hizuru. Through his emissary Yelena, Zeke proposed passing his Titan power to Historia, which would enable Eren to use the Founding Titan's full power to deter foreign invasion until Hizuru modernizes Paradis. Because users of Titan power die thirteen years after their acquisition, the proposition demanded that Historia produce heirs to ensure the availability of the Founding Titan's power. Eren disapproved of this arrangement and instead infiltrated Marley alone and without authorization, coercing the Survey Corps's assistance.\n\nIn the present, Eren is detained for insubordination and his friends express doubt in his loyalties to them and Paradis over Zeke, citing Eren's role in Sasha's death. It is revealed that Historia is pregnant, preventing the Corps from immediately passing the Beast Titan to her and forcing them to place Zeke under Levi's watch. Suspected of arranging Historia's pregnancy to prolong Zeke's life, Yelena and her followers are arrested. The military's leaders distrust Eren and plan to relinquish his power following the discovery of his secret correspondence with Zeke and Yelena, prompting nationalist rebels loyal to Eren to assassinate Dhalis Zachary. Eren and his Yeagerist followers escape and force the government's surrender after wine laced with Zeke's spinal fluid has been served to top military officials, enabling Zeke to transform them into titans under his command. Zeke uses this ability to escape from and incapacitate Levi. \n\nEren and the Yeagerists detain the military in Shiganshina, where they are ambushed by the Warriors and Marley's military. During the battle, Zeke turns the marked soldiers, consisting of the entire military high command - including Commanders Dot Pyxis and Nile Dok - as well as Falco into Titans, with the latter inheriting the Jaw Titan from the Warrior Porco Galliard. Despite Marley's efforts, Eren and Zeke make contact and meet in a transcendental space inhabited by Ymir Fritz. Zeke attempts to persuade Eren to sterilize the Eldian race as they had originally planned, but Eren revokes his allegiance with Zeke and uses the Founding Titan's power to free the wall Titans, intending to [[Human_extinction#Omnicide|destroy all life]] outside of Paradis in order to protect it. Refusing to accept his plan, Eren's friends join forces with Annie, who was also freed from her crystal encasement by Eren's power, and a few remaining soldiers from Marley to confront him.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Hajime Isayama.png|thumb|The series' author Hajime Isayama]]\n[[Hajime Isayama]] created a 65-page [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] version of ''Attack on Titan'' in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-05-07/1st-attack-of-titan-blu-ray/dvd-to-bundle-manga-prototype |title=1st Attack on Titan Blu-ray/DVD to Bundle Manga 'Prototype' |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110071559/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-05-07/1st-attack-of-titan-blu-ray/dvd-to-bundle-manga-prototype |archivedate=November 10, 2013  }}</ref> Originally, he also offered his work to the ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' department at [[Shueisha]], where he was advised to modify his style and story to be more suitable for ''Jump''.

Although it has gained significant fame and popularity in Japan's neighbouring countries, political interpretations of the series has caused controversies in China and South Korea.<!--This refers to South Korean media claiming it has a \"militaristic message\" and death threats that the author received for modelling a character after an Imperial Japanese Army general, both sourced in the reception section.-->\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{Long plot|section|date=January 2020}}\n\n===Setting===\nAccording to lore, over 2,000 years prior to the present day, a young woman named Ymir Fritz came into contact and made a deal with the \u201c[[Devil]] of All Earth\", becoming the first of humanoid giants, and imbued with special powers. These creatures later came to be known as {{nihongo4|[[List of Attack on Titan characters#Titans|Titans]]|\u5de8\u4eba|Kyojin}}. Her powers were used by her King to establish the Empire of Eldia and, in doing so, crushed the rival nation of Marley. When she died, her titan abilities were passed on, eventually manifesting into Nine individual forms; each with their own special traits. The power of the titans was kept by the royal Fritz family for centuries.\n\nOne century before the events of the main storyline the 145th Eldian King, Karl Fritz, became disillusioned by the powers his ancestors had granted him and guilt-ridden over the destructive path the Eldian monarchy had taken. He orchestrated his nation\u2019s downfall, allowing the nation of Marley to rise up in rebellion. In the process, Eight of the Nine Titan powers were stolen by Marley. Possessing the Ninth Titan power, the power of the Founding Titan, Fritz took a handful of his people across the sea to the island of Paradis to begin a new, peaceful nation. He created millions of Colossal Titans to be used as part of the construction of three [[Curtain wall (fortification)|curtain walls]], each one named after one of Ymir Fritz\u2019s three daughters: the outermost being {{nihongo4|Wall Maria|\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30de\u30ea\u30a2|W\u014dru Maria}}; the middle {{nihongo4|Wall Rose|\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30ed\u30fc\u30bc|W\u014dru R\u014dze|sometimes pronounced like ''[[ros\u00e9]]''}} and the innermost {{nihongo4|Wall Sheena|\u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b7\u30fc\u30ca|W\u014dru Sh\u012bna|alt. \"Wall Sina\"}} which housed the Royal family and was populated by the wealthy and elite. Once the walls were complete, Fritz gave the outside world an ultimatum: should war be declared on Paradis, he would release the titans within the walls to flatten the earth. This, however, was a bluff since Fritz revealed to his family that he had renounced all war. If Marley eventually became powerful enough to overthrow Paradis, then he would accept that. He used his Founding Titan powers to create a blood pact which would instill this ideology in any royal family member who inherited his titan, even if they disagreed with it before. Meanwhile, Eldians who remained within Marley as second class citizens were treated poorly, and any form of dissent or disobedience was punishable by exile to Paradis: they were injected with raw titan spinal fluid, turning them into mindless, man-eating \u2018Pure\u2019 Titans which would eventually find their way to King Fritz\u2019s walls.\n\nKarl Fritz also used his titan power to erase the memories of most of his Eldian citizens, with those unaffected either bribed into nobility or made into outcasts like the Ackerman family and the Asian clan. The power of the titans was hidden from common knowledge and fear of them was instilled in the Eldian citizens to prevent them from venturing outside the walls. As such, the Eldians on Paradis believed firmly that they were the last of the human race, forced into confinement by the ravenous Pure Titans. Unlike titans with powers, such as the Founding Titan, Pure Titans have no awareness and function purely on the instinct to consume humans; the idea being that, if they were to consume a human containing a power of one of the Nine titans, they would inherit that power and become a sentient human again. Unaware of this information the Eldians formed a three branch military to protect its citizens: the {{Nihongo4|[[List of Attack on Titan characters#Military Police Brigade|Military Police Brigade]]|\u61b2\u5175\u56e3|Kenpeidan}} who reside primarily within Wall Sina and protect the Royal Family and elite, living a relaxed lifestyle which has resulted in instances of fraud, corruption, and political subterfuge; the {{Nihongo4|[[List of Attack on Titan characters#Garrison Regiment|Garrison Regiment]]|\u99d0\u5c6f\u5175\u56e3|Ch\u016bton Heidan}} who guard the walls and the civilian populace, though are known to act lackadaisically since the walls themselves do much of the protecting against titans; and the {{nihongo4|[[List of Attack on Titan characters#Survey Corps|Survey Corps]]|\u8abf\u67fb\u5175\u56e3|Ch\u014dsa Heidan}} who trek into titan territory outside the walls in order to study and cull them and attempt to reclaim land. The Survey Corps is heavily derided within society because of their high casualty rate and little to no progress in their objectives. All soldiers use a grappling and tethering system called {{nihongo4|Vertical Maneuvering Equipment|\u7acb\u4f53\u6a5f\u52d5\u88c5\u7f6e|Rittai Kid\u014d S\u014dchi}} that allows them to jump onto, and swing from, any tall structures using gas canisters to propel themselves forward, though the equipment is useless on flat ground. A box containing spare blades for their dual swords hangs beside each thigh, and the blades themselves are flexible and easily detachable, used solely for cutting down titans. Over the past 100 years the Survey Corp has compiled characteristics of the Pure Titans to aid them in battle. A titan's skin is tough and difficult to penetrate and they regenerate quickly from any injuries, save for a spot on the [[nape]] of the neck which is the one and only place where a soldier can make a fatal strike.\n\n===Plot===\n{{See also|List of Attack on Titan characters}}\nEren Yeager(Jaeger in the anime adaptation) lives with Mikasa Ackerman and best friend Armin Arlert in the town of Shiganshina adjacent to Wall Maria, outermost of three circular walls protecting humanity from man-eating Titans said to have killed all other humans one hundred years prior. When Shiganshina and Wall Maria are breached by the Colossal(Colossus in the manga) and Armoured Titans, invading Titans force humanity to retreat behind Wall Rose. After a titan devours his mother and his father disappears, a vengeful Eren enlists in the military along with Mikasa and Armin.\n\nFive years later, the three cadet graduates are positioned in Trost district adjacent to Wall Rose when the Colossal Titan breaches the city gate. During the subsequent Titan invasion, Eren is eaten but survives after creating and controlling a Titan's body. Previously unaware of his abilities, Eren suspects his father's basement holds answers. Although Eren seals Trost's breach using his Titan power, many consider him a potential threat and a military tribunal assigns him to the Survey Corps under Captain Levi's watch, with many of Eren's friends following suit.\n\nDuring an expedition to Shiganshina, a Female Titan unsuccessfully attempts to capture Eren. Despite the expedition's failure, Armin deduces the Female Titan's identity as a fellow cadet from their class named Annie Leonhart with abilities akin to Eren's. Annie encases herself in crystal following her capture in Stohess, collateral damage revealing the walls are formed from massive Titans within them. Following the mysterious appearance of the Beast Titan behind Wall Rose, Eren is kidnapped by his fellow cadets Reiner Braun and Bertolt Hoover, exposed as the Titans who compromised Wall Maria. They and Annie were dispatched by an unknown party to capture the \"Coordinate\", an ability to control titans which they suspect Eren possesses. Eren manifests this power during an encounter with the titan who killed his mother, allowing him and the pursuing Survey Corps to escape. The Corps theorize that Titans were originally humans, and may regain their human form by consuming an individual with Titan power, acquiring those abilities for themselves.\n\nPersecuted by the military police, the Survey Corps discover the royal government seats a figurehead king and suppresses technological advancement. Eren's comrade Historia Reiss learns she is the illegitimate child of the walls' true ruler Rod Reiss, who has her and Eren kidnapped. Rod reveals his ancestor created the walls using the power of the Founding Titan, intending to confine humanity and erasing their memories. The Reiss family passed down the King's power and will until Eren's father Grisha stole the power of the Founding Titan during Wall Maria's fall, and passed its power to Eren by turning him into a Titan via an injection and allowing himself to be devoured. Rod intends for Historia to become a Titan and eat Eren to reclaim the Reiss family's power, but Historia refuses and aids the Survey Corps' rescue of Eren and rebellion against the monarchy. Following Rod's defeat, the military assumes power and crowns Historia queen. Although Eren's lack of royal ancestry inhibits the Founding Titan's power, he obtains an ability to create permanent structures, which the Survey Corps use in their next expedition to seal the breach in Wall Maria. However, the group are ambushed by Reiner, Bertolt and their superior Zeke, the Beast Titan. The Survey Corps subdue Bertolt and drive off the other enemy Titans, but most of the expedition members are killed during the battle with Armin and Commander Erwin Smith left mortally wounded. Levi, armed with a single injection taken from Rod, decides to save Armin over Erwin. Armin becomes a Titan, devours Bertolt and acquires the Colossal Titan's powers.\n\nBefore returning home, the survivors recover Grisha's memoirs from the Yeagers' basement. His writings state that human civilization is actually thriving and the people of the walls are members of the Eldian race, whose common ancestor Ymir Fritz acquired the Power of the Titans, granting her progeny the unique potential to become Titans and inherit nine Titan powers. Ymir's descendants dominated world history for centuries until 100 years prior to the series' beginning, when the 145th Eldian King retreated to Paradis Island and established the three walls with the Founding Titan, threatening to retaliate with the titans comprising the walls should his peace be disturbed. The nation of Marley conquered and quarantined the remaining Eldians, passing the seven captured Titan Powers to indoctrinated Eldian \"Warriors\" for furthering Marley's national interests. Grisha conspired with other Eldian dissidents to acquire the Founding Titan before Marley and free their people but was outed by his son Zeke Yeager, Eren's half-brother and the future Beast Titan, and sentenced to life as a mindless Titan wandering Paradis. However, Grisha was saved by his movement's informant, who entrusted his Titan power and mission to Grisha and sent him to infiltrate the walls and recover the Founding Titan. Eren learns that despite his lack of royal ancestry, he may be able to use the Founding Titan's full \"Coordinate\" power through physical contact with a titan of royal blood.\n\nFour years after the Battle of Shiganshina, a conflict between Marley and a combined offensive sees the emergence of conventional weapons capable of defeating Titans. Fearing the military obsolescence of Eldians will lead to their genocide, the Warriors work with the influential Tybur family, retainers of the War Hammer Titan, to recruit global support for a resumed offensive on Paradis. Eren, having infiltrated Marley on his own, assassinates Willy Tybur as he declares war on Paradis before international delegates. With the aid of the Survey Corps in the ensuing battle, Eren steals the War Hammer Titan's power and Zeke defects to Paradis. Eren and the Survey Corps return to Paradis with Zeke via airship, but Eren's friend Sasha is killed by Gabi Braun, Warrior candidate and Reiner's cousin who stowed away along with her friend Falco Grice.\n\nFlashbacks depict the preceding four years on Paradis, during which Zeke's followers arrived and introduced Paradis to modern technology and the friendly nation of Hizuru. Through his emissary Yelena, Zeke proposed passing his Titan power to Historia, which would enable Eren to use the Founding Titan's full power to deter foreign invasion until Hizuru modernizes Paradis. Because users of Titan power die thirteen years after their acquisition, the proposition demanded that Historia produce heirs to ensure the availability of the Founding Titan's power. Eren disapproved of this arrangement and instead infiltrated Marley alone and without authorization, coercing the Survey Corps's assistance.\n\nIn the present, Eren is detained for insubordination and his friends express doubt in his loyalties to them and Paradis over Zeke, citing Eren's role in Sasha's death. It is revealed that Historia is pregnant, preventing the Corps from immediately passing the Beast Titan to her and forcing them to place Zeke under Levi's watch. Suspected of arranging Historia's pregnancy to prolong Zeke's life, Yelena and her followers are arrested. The military's leaders distrust Eren and plan to relinquish his power following the discovery of his secret correspondence with Zeke and Yelena, prompting nationalist rebels loyal to Eren to assassinate Dhalis Zachary. Eren and his Yeagerist followers escape and force the government's surrender after wine laced with Zeke's spinal fluid has been served to top military officials, enabling Zeke to transform them into titans under his command. Zeke uses this ability to escape from and incapacitate Levi. \n\nEren and the Yeagerists detain the military in Shiganshina, where they are ambushed by the Warriors and Marley's military. During the battle, Zeke turns the marked soldiers, consisting of the entire military high command - including Commanders Dot Pyxis and Nile Dok - as well as Falco into Titans, with the latter inheriting the Jaw Titan from the Warrior Porco Galliard. Despite Marley's efforts, Eren and Zeke make contact and meet in a transcendental space inhabited by Ymir Fritz. Zeke attempts to persuade Eren to sterilize the Eldian race as they had originally planned, but Eren revokes his allegiance with Zeke and uses the Founding Titan's power to free the wall Titans, intending to [[Human_extinction#Omnicide|destroy all life]] outside of Paradis in order to protect it. Refusing to accept his plan, Eren's friends join forces with Annie, who was also freed from her crystal encasement by Eren's power, and a few remaining soldiers from Marley to confront him.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Hajime Isayama.png|thumb|The series' author Hajime Isayama]]\n[[Hajime Isayama]] created a 65-page [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] version of ''Attack on Titan'' in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-05-07/1st-attack-of-titan-blu-ray/dvd-to-bundle-manga-prototype |title=1st Attack on Titan Blu-ray/DVD to Bundle Manga 'Prototype' |work=[[Anime News Network]] |date=May 7, 2013 |accessdate=November 2, 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110071559/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-05-07/1st-attack-of-titan-blu-ray/dvd-to-bundle-manga-prototype |archivedate=November 10, 2013  }}</ref> Originally, he also offered his work to the ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' department at [[Shueisha]], where he was advised to modify his style and story to be more suitable for ''Jump''.

He also built watercraft and worked as a sparmaker. In the mid-1830s, Smith was the initiator of a steamboat line from Ossining to New York City, supervising the construction of two steamboats for the line and taking command of the first. \n\nIn 1849, Smith opened a shipyard in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], where he built a wide variety of vessels, from small sloops to steamboats to large, full-rigged ships. In 1853 he was joined in this venture by his son J. Malcolm Smith, the firm then being renamed '''Isaac C. Smith & Son'''. About 30 ships were built at this yard before it closed in 1855 due to a nationwide shipbuilding slump. In all, Isaac is said to have built about 100 ships through the course of his career, the best known of which was the 1600-ton {{ship||Hurricane|clipper|2}}, reputedly the most [[extreme clipper]] ever built.<ref name=howeandmatthews1926_p277/><ref name=fairburn1945-55_p2129/> \n\nSmith was also a devout [[Methodism|Methodist]] and contributed to the construction of five churches of that denomination in his native town, for which he was known as \"the father of Sing Sing Methodism\".<ref name=scharf1886_p561/>  \n\n== Life and career == \n\nIsaac C.

Smith''' (1797&ndash;1877) was a [[New York]] sail and steamboat captain, [[shipbuilding|shipbuilder]], [[Spar (sailing)|sparmaker]] and [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]]. \n\nA longterm resident of [[Ossining, New York]] (then known as Sing Sing), Smith began his career working aboard [[Hudson River]] [[sloop]]s, eventually rising to the rank of captain. He also built watercraft and worked as a sparmaker. In the mid-1830s, Smith was the initiator of a steamboat line from Ossining to New York City, supervising the construction of two steamboats for the line and taking command of the first. \n\nIn 1849, Smith opened a shipyard in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], where he built a wide variety of vessels, from small sloops to steamboats to large, full-rigged ships. In 1853 he was joined in this venture by his son J. Malcolm Smith, the firm then being renamed '''Isaac C. Smith & Son'''. About 30 ships were built at this yard before it closed in 1855 due to a nationwide shipbuilding slump. In all, Isaac is said to have built about 100 ships through the course of his career, the best known of which was the 1600-ton {{ship||Hurricane|clipper|2}}, reputedly the most [[extreme clipper]] ever built.<ref name=howeandmatthews1926_p277/><ref name=fairburn1945-55_p2129/> \n\nSmith was also a devout [[Methodism|Methodist]] and contributed to the construction of five churches of that denomination in his native town, for which he was known as \"the father of Sing Sing Methodism\".<ref name=scharf1886_p561/>  \n\n== Life and career == \n\nIsaac C.

For example, the candidate {{IPA|/\u0295/}} sound in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and standard [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] (not modern Hebrew \u2013 Israelis generally pronounce this as a [[glottal stop]]) has been variously described as a [[voiced epiglottal fricative]], an epiglottal approximant,<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ladefoged|Maddieson|1996|pp=167\u2013168}}</ref> or a [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] [[glottal stop]].<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Thelwall|1990}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=\"2\" | Language !!
