The [[Byzantine\u2013Ottoman wars]] (1265\u20131479) and the [[Ottoman wars in Europe]] (14th to 20th centuries) resulted in the capture of large numbers of [[Christians|Christian]] slaves.

[[Zanzibar]] became a leading port in this trade. Arab slave traders differed from European ones in that they would often conduct raiding expeditions themselves, sometimes penetrating deep into the continent. They also differed in that their market greatly preferred the purchase of female slaves over male ones. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe increased presence of European rivals along the East coast led Arab traders to concentrate on the overland slave caravan routes across the [[Sahara]] from the [[Sahel]] to North Africa. The German explorer [[Gustav Nachtigal]] reported seeing slave caravans departing from [[Kukawa]] in [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] bound for [[Tripoli]] and [[Egypt]] in 1870. The slave trade represented the major source of revenue for the state of Bornu as late as 1898.

Ships having landed slaves in [[Caribbean]] ports would take on sugar, indigo, raw cotton, and later coffee, and make for [[Liverpool]], [[Nantes]], Lisbon or [[Amsterdam]]. Ships leaving European ports for West Africa would carry printed cotton textiles, some originally from India, copper utensils and bangles, pewter plates and pots, iron bars more valued than gold, hats, trinkets, gunpowder and firearms and alcohol. Tropical [[shipworm]]s were eliminated in the cold Atlantic waters, and at each unloading, a profit was made.\n\nThe [[Atlantic slave trade]] peaked in the late 18th century when the largest number of slaves were captured on raiding expeditions into the interior of West Africa. These expeditions were typically carried out by African states, such as the [[Oyo empire]] ([[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]), [[Kong Empire]], [[Kingdom of Benin]], [[Imamate of Futa Jallon]], [[Imamate of Futa Toro]], [[Kingdom of Koya]], [[Kingdom of Khasso]], [[Kaabu|Kingdom of Kaabu]], [[Fante Confederacy]], [[Ashanti Confederacy]], [[Aro Confederacy]] and the kingdom of [[Dahomey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/slav/hd_slav.htm |title=The Transatlantic Slave Trade |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> Europeans rarely entered the interior of Africa, due to fear of [[tropical diseases|disease]] and moreover fierce African resistance. The slaves were brought to coastal outposts where they were traded for goods. The people captured on these expeditions were shipped by European traders to the colonies of the [[New World]]. As a result of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the United Kingdom obtained the monopoly (''[[asiento de negros]]'') of transporting captive Africans to [[Spanish America]]. It is estimated that over the centuries, twelve to twenty million people were shipped as slaves from Africa by European traders, of whom some 15 percent died during the terrible voyage, many during the arduous journey through the [[Middle Passage]].

There were three types:  those who were slaves through conquest, those who were slaves due to unpaid debts, or those whose parents gave them as slaves to tribal chiefs. Chieftains would barter their slaves to Arab, Berber, Ottoman or European buyers for rum, spices, cloth or other goods.<ref name=afbis>{{cite web|url=http://www.afbis.com/analysis/slave.htm |title=Slave trade: a root of contemporary African Crisis |author=Tunde Obadina |publisher=Africa Business Information Services |accessdate=19 September 2010}}</ref> Selling captives or prisoners was commonly practiced among Africans, Turks, Berbers and Arabs during that era. However, as the Atlantic slave trade increased its demand, local systems which primarily serviced indentured servitude expanded. European slave trading, as a result, was the most pivotal change in the social, economic, cultural, spiritual, religious, political dynamics of the concept of slave trading. It ultimately undermined local economies and political stability as villages' vital labour forces were shipped overseas as [[slave raid]]s and civil wars became commonplace. Crimes which were previously punishable by some other means became punishable by enslavement.<ref>Graeber, David. 2012. Debt: The First 5,000 Years.

That is the verdict of our oracle and the priests. They say that your country, however great, can never stop a trade ordained by God himself.</blockquote>\n\nJoseph Miller states that African buyers would prefer males, but in reality, women and children would be more easily captured as men fled. Those captured would be sold for various reasons such as food, debts, or servitude. Once captured, the journey to the coast killed many and weakened others. Disease engulfed many, and insufficient food damaged those who made it to the coasts. Scurvy was so common that it was known as ''mal de Luanda'' (Luanda sickness).<ref name=\"Miller, Joseph 1988. p 380-387\">Miller, Joseph. \"West Central Africa.\" The Way of Death. University of Wisconsin. 1988. pp. 380\u201387, 389\u201391, 398\u2013405, 440\u201341.</ref> The assumption for those who died on the journey died from malnutrition. As food was limited, water may have been just as bad. Dysentery was widespread and poor sanitary conditions at ports did not help. Since supplies were poor, slaves were not equipped with the best clothing that further exposed to more diseases.<ref name=\"Miller, Joseph 1988. p 380-387\"/>\n\nIf the fear of disease caused terror, the psyche of slaves for being captured was just as terrifying. The most popular assumption for being captured was Europeans were cannibals. Stories and rumours spread that whites captured Africans to eat them.<ref name=\"Miller, Joseph 1988. p 380-387\"/> Olaudah Equiano accounts his experience about the sorrow slaves encountered at the ports. He talks about his first moment on a [[slave ship]] and asked if he was going to be eaten.<ref>Equiano, Olaudah. The Life of Olaudah Equiano or Gustavus Vassa: The African. Publisher Isaac Knapp. Boston. 1837. Chapter 2.</ref> Yet, the worst for slaves has only begun, and the journey on the water proved to be more terrifying. For every 100 Africans captured, only 64 would reach the coast, and only about 50 would reach the New World.<ref name=\"Miller, Joseph 1988. p 380-387\"/>\n\nOthers believe that slavers had a vested interest in capturing rather than killing, and in keeping their captives alive; and that this coupled with the disproportionate removal of males and the introduction of new crops from the Americas ([[cassava]], maize) would have limited general [[population decline]] to particular regions of western Africa around 1760\u20131810, and in [[Mozambique]] and neighbouring areas half a century later. There has also been speculation that within Africa, females were most often [[Bride kidnapping|captured as brides]], with their male protectors being a \"bycatch\" who would have been killed if there had not been an export market for them.\n\nBritish explorer [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]] encountered a group of slaves when traveling through [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] country:\n\n{{Blockquote|They were all very inquisitive, but they viewed me at first with looks of horror, and repeatedly asked if my countrymen were cannibals.

I then asked where were their women? Had they any like themselves? I was told that they had. \"And why,\" said I, \"do we not see them?\" They answered, because they were left behind. I asked how the vessel could go? They told me they could not tell; but that there was cloth put upon the masts by the help of the ropes I saw, and then the vessel went on; and the white men had some spell or magic they put in the water when they liked, in order to stop the vessel. I was exceedingly amazed at this account, and really thought they were spirits. I there-fore wished much to be from amongst them, for I expected they would sacrifice me; but my wishes were vain\u2014for we were so quartered that it was impossible for any of us to make our escape. </blockquote><ref name=\"Smallwood, Stephanie E 2008\">Smallwood, Stephanie E. Saltwater Slavery: A Middle Passage from Africa to American Diaspora. 1st Harvard University Press pbk. ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2008.</ref>\nAccounts like these raised many questions as some slaves grew philosophical with their journey. Smallwood points out the challenges for slaves were physical and metaphysical. The physical would be obvious as the challenge to overcome capacity, lack of ship room, and food. The metaphysical was unique as the open sea would challenge African slaves' vision of the ocean as habitable.<ref name=\"Smallwood, Stephanie E 2008\"/>\nAt essence, the journey on the ocean would prove to be an African's biggest fear that would keep them in awe. Combining this with the lack of knowledge of the sea, Africans would be entering a world of anxiety never seen before. Yet, Europeans were also fearful of the sea, but not to the extent of Africans. One of these dilemmas came with the sense of time. Africans used seasonal weather to predict time and days. The moon was a sense of time, but used like in other cultures. On the sea, Africans used the moon to best count the days, but the sea did not provide seasonal changes for them to know how long they were at sea.<ref name=\"Smallwood, Stephanie E 2008\"/>\nCounting the days on a ship was not the main priority, however. Surviving the voyage was the main horror. No one escaped diseases as the close quarters infected everyone including the crew. Death was so common that ships were called ''tumbeiros'' or floating tombs.<ref name=\"Smallwood, Stephanie E 2008\"/> What shocked Africans the most was how death was handled in the ships. Smallwood says the traditions for an African death was delicate and community-based. On ships, bodies would be thrown into the sea. Because the sea represented bad omens, bodies in the sea represented a form of purgatory and the ship a form of hell. In the end, the Africans who made the journey would have survived disease, malnutrition, confined space, close death, and the trauma of the ship.\n\n===North Africa===\n{{main|Barbary slave trade}}\n[[File:Debarquement et maltraitement de prisonniers a alger.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|Christian slaves]] in Algiers, 1706]]\nIn [[Algiers]] during the time of the [[Regency of Algiers]] in North Africa in the 19th century, 1.5 million [[Christians]] and [[Europe]]ans were captured and forced into slavery.<ref>{{Cite book|title=White Gold: The Extraordinary Story of Thomas Pellow and Islam's One Million White Slaves|last=Milton|first=Giles|date=8 June 2005|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0374289355|edition=1st American|language=English|url=https://archive.org/details/whitegoldextraor00milt}}</ref> This eventually led to the [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|Bombardment of Algiers]] in 1816 by the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]], forcing the [[Dey of Algiers]] to free many slaves.<ref>Baepler, B. \"White Slaves, African Masters 1st Edition.\" White Slaves, African Masters 1st Edition by Baepler.

In Brazil, the Maroon villages were called [[Palenque (village)|palenques]] or [[quilombo]]s. Maroons survived by growing vegetables and hunting. They also raided [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantations]]. At these attacks, the maroons would burn crops, steal livestock and tools, kill slavemasters, and invite other slaves to join their communities.<ref>Richard Price, ''Maroon societies: Rebel slave communities in the Americas'' (JHU Press, 1996)</ref>\n\n[[Jean-Baptiste Debret]], a French painter who was active in Brazil in the first decades of the 19th century, started out with painting portraits of members of the Brazilian Imperial family, but soon became concerned with the slavery of both blacks and indigenous inhabitants. His paintings on the subject (two appear on this page) helped bring attention to the subject in both Europe and Brazil itself.\n\nThe [[Clapham Sect]], a group of [[Evangelism|evangelical]] reformers, campaigned during much of the 19th century for Britain to use its influence and power to stop the traffic of slaves to Brazil. Besides moral qualms, the low cost of slave-produced Brazilian sugar meant that British colonies in the West Indies were unable to match the market prices of Brazilian sugar, and each Briton was consuming 16&nbsp;pounds (7&nbsp;kg) of sugar a year by the 19th century. This combination led to intensive pressure from the British government for Brazil to end this practice, which it did by steps over several decades.<ref>Leslie Bethell, ''The Abolition of the Brazilian Slave Trade: Britain, Brazil and the Slave Trade Question'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009)</ref>\n\nFirst, foreign slave trade was banned in 1850. Then, in 1871, the sons of the slaves were freed. In 1885, slaves aged over 60 years were freed. The [[Paraguayan War]] contributed to ending slavery as many slaves enlisted in exchange for freedom. In Colonial Brazil, slavery was more a social than a racial condition. Some of the greatest figures of the time, like the writer [[Machado de Assis]] and the engineer [[Andr\u00e9 Rebou\u00e7as]] had black ancestry.\n\nBrazil's 1877\u201378 [[Grande Seca]] (Great Drought) in the cotton-growing northeast led to major turmoil, starvation, poverty and internal migration. As wealthy plantation holders rushed to sell their slaves south, popular resistance and resentment grew, inspiring numerous emancipation societies. They succeeded in banning slavery altogether in the province of Cear\u00e1 by 1884.<ref>Mike Davis, ''Late Victorian Holocausts'', 88\u201390</ref> Slavery was legally ended nationwide on 13 May by the ''[[Lei \u00c1urea]]'' (\"Golden Law\") of 1888.

These indentured servants were treated so poorly that future indentured servants stopped going to Barbados, and there were not enough people to work the fields.

These newly freed servants were rarely able to support themselves comfortably, and the tobacco industry was increasingly dominated by large planters. This caused domestic unrest culminating in [[Bacon's Rebellion]]. Eventually, chattel slavery became the norm in regions dominated by plantations.\n\nThe [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]] established a model in which a rigid social hierarchy placed slaves under the absolute authority of their master. With the rise of a plantation economy in the [[Carolina Lowcountry]] based on rice cultivation, a slave society was created that later became the model for the [[King Cotton]] economy across the [[Deep South]]. The model created by South Carolina was driven by the emergence of a majority slave population that required repressive and often brutal force to control. Justification for such a slave society developed into a conceptual framework of white superiority and aristocratic privilege.<ref>Wilson, Thomas D.

Slavery in Canada was largely ended by judicial court decisions by the early nineteenth century. Refugees from slavery fled the South across the Ohio River to the North via the [[Underground Railroad]]. Midwestern state governments asserted [[States Rights]] arguments to refuse federal jurisdiction over fugitives. Some juries exercised their right of [[jury nullification]] and refused to convict those indicted under the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]].\n\nAfter the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] in 1854, armed conflict broke out in [[Kansas Territory]], where the question of whether it would be admitted to the Union as a slave state or a free state had been left to the inhabitants. The radical abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was active in the mayhem and killing in \"[[Bleeding Kansas]].\" The true turning point in public opinion is better fixed at the [[Lecompton Constitution]] fraud. Pro-slavery elements in Kansas had arrived first from Missouri and quickly organized a territorial government that excluded abolitionists. Through the machinery of the territory and violence, the pro-slavery faction attempted to force an unpopular pro-slavery constitution through the state. This infuriated Northern Democrats, who supported popular sovereignty, and was exacerbated by the [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]] administration reneging on a promise to submit the constitution to a referendum\u2014which would surely fail. Anti-slavery legislators took office under the banner of the newly formed [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The Supreme Court in the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' decision]] of 1857 asserted that one could take one's property anywhere, even if one's property was [[Chattel slavery|chattel]] and one crossed into a free territory. It also asserted that African Americans could not be federal citizens. Outraged critics across the North denounced these episodes as the latest of the [[Slave Power]] (the politically organized slave owners) taking more control of the nation.<ref>Leonard L.

The central issue in politics in the 1850s involved the extension of slavery into the western territories, which settlers from the Northern states opposed. The Whig Party split and collapsed on the slavery issue, to be replaced in the North by [[History of the United States Republican Party|the new Republican Party]], which was dedicated to stopping the expansion of slavery. Republicans gained a majority in every northern state by [[Free Soil Party|absorbing a faction of anti-slavery Democrats]], and warning that slavery was a backward system that undercut democracy and economic modernization.<ref>Eric Foner, ''Free soil, free labor, free men: The ideology of the Republican party before the civil war'' (1971).</ref>  Numerous compromise proposals were put forward, but they all collapsed. A majority of Northern voters were committed to stopping the expansion of slavery, which they believed would ultimately end slavery. Southern voters were overwhelmingly angry that they were being treated as second-class citizens. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|election of 1860]], the Republicans swept [[Abraham Lincoln]] into the Presidency and his party took control (with only 39.8% of the popular vote) and legislators into Congress. The states of the deep South, convinced that the economic power of what they called \"[[King Cotton]]\" would overwhelm the North and win support from Europe voted to seceded from the U.S. (the Union). They formed the [[Confederate States of America]], based on the promise of maintaining slavery. War broke out in April 1861, as both sides sought wave after wave of enthusiasm among young men volunteering to form new regiments and new armies. In the North, the main goal was to preserve the union as an expression of American nationalism.\n[[File:Company I of the 36th Colored Regiment.jpg|thumb|Company I of the 36th Colored Regiment [[United States Colored Troops|USCT]]]]\n\nBy 1862 most northern leaders realized that the mainstay of Southern secession, slavery, had to be attacked head-on. All the border states rejected President Lincoln's proposal for compensated emancipation. However, by 1865 all had begun the abolition of slavery, except Kentucky and Delaware. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was an executive order issued by Lincoln on 1 January 1863. In a single stroke, it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free.\" It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves. The owners were never compensated.<ref>Michael Vorenberg, ed.

The people subjected to [[Roman slavery]] came from all over Europe and the Mediterranean. Such oppression by an elite minority eventually led to [[slave revolts]]; the [[Third Servile War]] led by [[Spartacus]] was the most famous and severe. Greeks, [[Berber people|Berbers]], [[Germanic peoples|Germans]], [[Brython|Britons]], [[Slavs]], [[Thracians]], [[Gauls]] (or [[Celts]]), [[Jews]], [[Arabs]] and many more ethnic groups were enslaved to be used for labor, and also for amusement (e.g. [[gladiator]]s and [[sex slave]]s). If a slave ran away, they were liable to be [[crucified]].\n\nThe overall impact of slavery on the Italian genetics was insignificant though, because the slaves imported in Italy were native Europeans, and very few if any of them had extra European origin. This has been further confirmed by recent biochemical analysis of 166 skeletons from three non-elite imperial-era cemeteries in the vicinity of Rome (where the bulk of the slaves lived), which shows that only 1 individual definitely came from outside of Europe (North Africa), and another 2 possibly did, but results are inconclusive. In the rest of the Italian peninsula, the amount of non European slaves was definitively much lower than that.<ref>{{cite journal|title= Isotopic evidence for age-related immigration to imperial Rome| doi=10.1002/ajpa.20541 | volume=132|issue= 4|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|pages=510\u201319|pmid=17205550 | last1 = Prowse | first1 = TL | last2 = Schwarcz | first2 = HP | last3 = Garnsey | first3 = P | last4 = Knyf | first4 = M | last5 = Macchiarelli | first5 = R | last6 = Bondioli | first6 = L|year= 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title= All Roads Lead to Rome: Exploring Human Migration to the Eternal City through Biochemistry of Skeletons from Two Imperial-Era Cemeteries (1st\u20133rd c AD)|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0147585 |pmid = 26863610|pmc=4749291 | volume=11|issue= 2|journal=PLoS ONE|page=e0147585|year= 2016|last1= Killgrove|first1= Kristina|last2= Montgomery|first2= Janet|bibcode= 2016PLoSO..1147585K}}</ref>\n\n====Celtic tribes====\n[[Celts|Celtic]] tribes of Europe are recorded by various Roman sources as owning slaves.

In the West, their target populations were primarily English, Irish, and Scottish, while in the East they were mainly Slavs. The Viking slave-trade slowly ended in the 11th century, as the Vikings settled in the European territories they had once raided.

Initially the Dutch shipped slaves to northern Brazil, and during the second half of the 17th century they had a controlling interest in the trade to the Spanish colonies. Today's Suriname and Guyana became prominent markets in the 18th century. Between 1612 and 1872, the Dutch operated from some 10 fortresses along the Gold Coast (now Ghana), from which slaves were shipped across the Atlantic.  Dutch involvement on the Slave Coast increased with the establishment of a trading post in [[Offra]] in 1660. [[Willem Bosman]] writes in his ''Nauwkeurige beschrijving van de Guinese Goud- Tand- en Slavekust'' (1703) that Allada was also called Grand Ardra, being the larger cousin of Little Ardra, also known as [[Offra]].

According to a 1670 report, annually 2,500 to 3,000 slaves were transported from Offra to the Americas. These numbers were only feasible in times of peace, however, and dwindled in time of conflict. From 1688 onward, the struggle between the [[Aja people|Aja]] king of Allada and the peoples on the coastal regions, impeded the supply of slaves. The Dutch West India Company chose the side of the Aja king, causing the Offra office to be destroyed by opposing forces in 1692.  By 1650 the Dutch had the pre-eminent slave trade in Europe and South East Asia. Later, trade shifted to [[Ouidah]].  On the instigation of Governor-General of the [[Dutch Gold Coast]] Willem de la Palma, [[Jacob van den Broucke]] was sent in 1703 as \"opperkommies\" (head merchant) to the Dutch trading post at [[Ouidah]], which according to sources was established around 1670.<ref name=\"AMH-Ouidah\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasofmutualheritage.nl/detail.aspx?page=dpost&lang=nl&id=819#tab2|title=Plaats: Ouidah (Fida, Whydah, Juda, Hueda, Whidah)|author=Atlas of Mutual Heritage|accessdate=6 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504150011/http://www.atlasofmutualheritage.nl/detail.aspx?page=dpost&lang=nl&id=819#tab2|archivedate=4 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Delepeleire3c2\">{{harvnb|Delepeleire|2004}}, section 3.c.2.</ref>  Political unrest caused the Dutch to abandon their trading post at Ouidah in 1725, and they then moved to [[Jaquim]], at which place they built [[Fort Zeelandia (Benin)|Fort Zeelandia]].<ref>P.C.

He sided with the wrong party, however, leading to a conflict with Director-General [[Jan Pranger]] and to his exile to the island of Appa in 1732. The Dutch trading post on this island was extended as the new centre of the slave trade. In 1733, Hertog returned to Jaquim, this time extending the trading post into [[Fort Zeelandia (Benin)|Fort Zeelandia]].

The 1805 raid was by American sealers and was one of a series that changed the attitude of the islanders to outside visitors, with reports in the 1820s and 1830s that all visitors received a hostile reception. In December 1862, [[Peru]]vian slave raiders took between 1,400 and 2,000 islanders back to Peru to work in the [[guano]] industry; this was about a third of the island's population and included much of the island's leadership, the last ''ariki-mau'' and possibly the last who could read [[Rongorongo]]. After intervention by the French ambassador in [[Lima]], the last 15 survivors were returned to the island, but brought with them [[smallpox]], which further devastated the island.\n\n==Abolitionist movements==\n{{Main|Abolitionism}}\n[[File:Proclamation esclavage.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the abolition of slavery by [[Victor Hugues]] in the [[Guadeloupe]], 1 November 1794]]\n\nSlavery has existed, in one form or another, throughout the whole of human history. So, too, have movements to free large or distinct groups of slaves. However, abolitionism should be distinguished from efforts to help a particular group of slaves, or to restrict one practice, such as the slave trade.\n\nDrescher (2009) provides a model for the history of the abolition of slavery, emphasizing its origins in Western Europe. Around the year 1500, slavery had virtually died out in Western Europe, but was a normal phenomenon practically everywhere else. The imperial powers \u2013 the British, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and [[Belgian Empire|Belgian]] empires, and a few others \u2013 built worldwide empires based primarily on plantation agriculture using slaves imported from Africa. However, the powers took care to minimize the presence of slavery in their homelands. In 1807 Britain and soon after, the United States also, both criminalized the international slave trade. The [[Royal Navy]] was increasingly effective in [[Blockade of Africa|intercepting slave ships]], freeing the captives and taking the crew for trial in courts.\n\nAlthough there were numerous slave revolts in the Caribbean, the only successful uprising came in the French colony of Haiti in the 1790s, where the slaves rose up, killed the [[mulattoes]] and whites, and established the independent Republic of Haiti. Europe recoiled in horror.\n\nThe continuing profitability of slave-based plantations and the threats of race war slowed the development of abolition movements during the first half of the 19th century. These movements were strongest in Britain, and after 1840 in the United States, in both instances, they were based on evangelical religious enthusiasm that said that owning a slave was a sin, and stressed the horrible impact on the slaves themselves. The Northern states of the United States abolished slavery, partly in response to the Declaration of Independence, between 1777 and 1804. Britain ended slavery in its empire in the 1830s. However, the plantation economies of the southern United States, based on cotton, and those in Brazil and Cuba, based on sugar, expanded and grew even more profitable. The bloody [[American Civil War]] ended slavery in the United States in 1865. The system ended in Cuba and Brazil in the 1880s because it was no longer profitable for the owners. Slavery continued to exist in Africa, where Arab slave traders raided black areas for new captives to be sold in the system. European colonial rule and diplomatic pressure slowly put an end to the trade, and eventually to the practice of slavery itself.<ref>Seymour Drescher, ''Abolition: A History of Slavery and Antislavery'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009)</ref>\n\n===Persian Empire===\n:''See [[slavery of Iran]]''\n[[Cyrus the Great]], the founder of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]  prohibited the systematic enslavement of conquered non-combatant population.

The case has since been misrepresented as finding that [[slavery]] was unlawful in England (although not elsewhere in the [[British Empire]]). A similar case, that of [[Joseph Knight (slave)|Joseph Knight]], took place in Scotland five years later and ruled slavery to be contrary to the law of Scotland.\n\nFollowing the work of campaigners in the United Kingdom, such as [[William Wilberforce]] and [[Thomas Clarkson]], the [[Slave Trade Act 1807|Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade]] was passed by [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] on 25 March 1807, coming into effect the following year. The act imposed a fine of \u00a3100 for every slave found aboard a British ship. The intention was to outlaw entirely the [[Atlantic slave trade]] within the whole British Empire.\n\nThe significance of the abolition of the British slave trade lay in the number of people hitherto sold and carried by British slave vessels. Britain shipped 2,532,300 Africans across the Atlantic, equalling 41% of the total transport of 6,132,900 individuals. This made the British empire the biggest slave-trade contributor in the world due to the magnitude of the empire,  which made the abolition act all the more damaging to the global trade of slaves.<ref>Paul E.

The legal case of [[Jean Boucaux]] in 1739 clarified the unclear legal position of possible slaves in France, and was followed by laws that established registers for slaves in mainland France, who were limited to a three-year stay, for visits or learning a trade. Unregistered \"slaves\" in France were regarded as free. However, slavery was of vital importance in France's [[Caribbean]] possessions, especially [[Saint-Domingue]].\n\n====Abolition====\nIn 1793, influenced by the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]] of August 1789 and alarmed as the massive slave revolt of August 1791 that had become the [[Haitian Revolution]] threatened to ally itself with the British, the French Revolutionary commissioners [[Sonthonax]] and [[Polverel]] declared general emancipation to reconcile them with France. In Paris, on 4 February 1794, [[Abb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire]] and the [[Treaty|Convention]] ratified this action by officially abolishing slavery in all French territories outside mainland France, freeing all the slaves both for moral and security reasons.\n\n====Napoleon restores slavery====\n[[Napoleon]] came to power in 1799 and soon had grandiose plans for the French sugar colonies; to achieve them he reintroduced slavery.

Napoleon wanted to preserve France's financial benefits from the colony's sugar and coffee crops; he then planned to establish a major base at New Orleans. He therefore re-established slavery in Haiti and Guadeloupe, where it had been abolished after rebellions. Slaves and black freedmen fought the French for their freedom and independence. Revolutionary ideals played a central role in the fighting{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} for it was the slaves and their allies who were fighting for the revolutionary ideals of freedom and equality, while the French troops under General [[Charles Leclerc (general)|Charles Leclerc]] fought to restore the order of the ''ancien r\u00e9gime''.

Whereas Phillips presented the slave as the object of benign attention by the owners, historians such as [[Kenneth Stampp]] emphasized the mistreatment and abuse of the slave.<ref>Kolchin p. 135. David and Temin p. 741. The latter authors wrote, \"The vantage point correspondingly shifted from that of the master to that of his slave. The reversal culminated in Kenneth M. Stampp's ''The Peculiar Institution'' (1956), which rejected both the characterization of blacks as a biologically and culturally inferior, childlike people, and the depiction of the white planters as paternal [[Cavaliers]] coping with a vexing social problem that was not of their own making.\"</ref>\n\nIn the portrayal of the slave as a victim, the historian [[Stanley M. Elkins]] in his 1959 work ''Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life'' compared the effects of United States slavery to that resulting from the brutality of the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. He stated the institution destroyed the will of the slave, creating an \"emasculated, docile [[Sambo (racial term)|Sambo]]\" who identified totally with the owner. Elkins' thesis was challenged by historians. Gradually historians recognized that in addition to the effects of the owner-slave relationship, slaves did not live in a \"totally closed environment but rather in one that permitted the emergence of enormous variety and allowed slaves to pursue important relationships with persons other than their master, including those to be found in their families, churches and communities.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Kolchin|title=American Slavery: 1619\u20131877|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FaffAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA136|year=2003|page=136|isbn=978-0809016303}}</ref>\n\nEconomic historians [[Robert W. Fogel]] and [[Stanley L. Engerman]] in the 1970s, through their work ''Time on the Cross'', portrayed slaves as having internalized the [[Protestant work ethic]] of their owners.<ref>Kolchin p. 136</ref> In portraying the more benign version of slavery, they also argue in their 1974 book that the material conditions under which the slaves lived and worked compared favorably to those of free workers in the agriculture and industry of the time. (This was also an argument of Southerners during the 19th century.)\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, historians made use of sources such as black music and statistical census data to create a more detailed and nuanced picture of slave life. Relying also on 19th-century autobiographies of ex-slaves (known as [[slave narratives]]) and the WPA [[Slave Narrative Collection]], a set of interviews conducted with former slaves in the 1930s by the [[Federal Writers' Project]], historians described slavery as the slaves remembered it. Far from slaves' being strictly victims or content, historians showed slaves as both resilient and autonomous in many of their activities. Despite their exercise of autonomy and their efforts to make a life within slavery, current historians recognize the precariousness of the slave's situation. Slave children quickly learned that they were subject to the direction of both their parents and their owners. They saw their parents disciplined just as they came to realize that they also could be physically or verbally abused by their owners. Historians writing during this era include [[John Blassingame]] (''Slave Community''), [[Eugene Genovese]] (''Roll, Jordan, Roll''), [[Leslie Howard Owens]] (''This Species of Property''), and [[Herbert Gutman]] (''The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom'').<ref>Kolchin pp. 137\u201343. Horton and Horton p. 9</ref>\n\nImportant work on slavery has continued; for instance, in 2003 [[Steven Hahn]] published the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning account, ''A Nation under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South from Slavery to the Great Migration'', which examined how slaves built community and political understanding while enslaved, so they quickly began to form new associations and institutions when emancipated, including black churches separate from white control. In 2010, [[Robert E. Wright]] published a [[Conceptual model|model]] that explains why [[slavery]] was more prevalent in some areas than others (e.g. southern than northern [[Delaware]]) and why some [[firms]] (individuals, [[corporations]], plantation owners) chose [[slave labor]] while others used wage, indentured, or family labor instead.<ref name=\"Robert E.

In the 18th-century British merchant ships were the largest element in the \"Middle Passage\" which transported millions of slaves to the Western Hemisphere. Most of those who survived the journey wound up in the Caribbean, where the Empire had highly profitable sugar colonies, and the living conditions were bad (the plantation owners lived in Britain). Parliament ended the international transportation of slaves in 1807 and used the Royal Navy to enforce that ban. In 1833 it bought out the plantation owners and banned slavery. Historians before the 1940s argued that moralistic reformers such as [[William Wilberforce]] were primarily responsible.<ref>Frank Joseph Klingberg, ''The anti-slavery movement in England: a study in English humanitarianism'' (Yale University Press, 1926)</ref>\n\n[[Historical revisionism]] arrived when West Indian historian [[Eric Williams]], a Marxist, in ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (1944), rejected this moral explanation and argued that abolition was now more profitable, for a century of sugarcane raising had exhausted the soil of the islands, and the plantations had become unprofitable. It was more profitable to sell the slaves to the government than to keep up operations. The 1807 prohibition of the international trade, Williams argued, prevented French expansion on other islands. Meanwhile, British investors turned to Asia, where labor was so plentiful that slavery was unnecessary. Williams went on to argue that slavery played a major role in making Britain prosperous. The high profits from the slave trade, he said, helped finance the [[Industrial Revolution]]. Britain enjoyed prosperity because of the capital gained from the unpaid work of slaves.<ref>Barbara Solow and Stanley L. Engerman, eds., ''British capitalism and Caribbean slavery: The legacy of Eric Williams'' (Cambridge University Press, 2004)</ref>\n\nSince the 1970s numerous historians have challenged Williams from various angles and Gad Heuman has concluded, \"More recent research has rejected this conclusion; it is now clear that the colonies of the British Caribbean profited considerably during the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.\"<ref>Gad Heuman \"The British West Indies\"  in Andrew Porter, ed., ''The Oxford History of the British Empire \u2013 Vol. 3: The 19th Century'' (1999) 3:470</ref><ref>Seymour Drescher, \"Eric Williams: British Capitalism and British Slavery.\" ''History and Theory'' (1987): 180\u201396.

Ward, \"The British West Indies in the Age of Abolition,\" in P.J. Marshall, ed. ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume II: The Eighteenth Century'' (1998) pp. 415\u201339.</ref> Richardson (1998) finds Williams's claims regarding the Industrial Revolution are exaggerated, for profits from the slave trade amounted to less than 1% of domestic investment in Britain. Richardson further challenges claims (by African scholars) that the slave trade caused widespread depopulation and economic distress in Africa\u2014indeed that it caused the \"underdevelopment\" of Africa. Admitting the horrible suffering of slaves, he notes that many Africans benefited directly because the first stage of the trade was always firmly in the hands of Africans. European slave ships waited at ports to purchase cargoes of people who were captured in the hinterland by African dealers and tribal leaders. Richardson finds that the \"terms of trade\" (how much the ship owners paid for the slave cargo) moved heavily in favor of the Africans after about 1750. That is, indigenous elites inside West and Central Africa made large and growing profits from slavery, thus increasing their wealth and power.<ref>David Richardson, \"The British Empire and the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1660\u20131807,\" in P.J. Marshall, ed. ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume II: The Eighteenth Century'' (1998) pp. 440\u201364.</ref>\n\nEconomic historian [[Stanley Engerman]] finds that even without subtracting the associated costs of the slave trade (e.g., shipping costs, slave mortality, mortality of British people in Africa, defense costs) or reinvestment of profits back into the slave trade, the total profits from the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to less than 5% of the [[Economic history of the United Kingdom|British economy]] during any year of the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3113341|title = The Slave Trade and British Capital Formation in the Eighteenth Century: A Comment on the Williams Thesis|journal = The Business History Review|volume = 46|issue = 4|pages = 430\u2013443|last1 = Engerman|first1 = Stanley L.|year = 1972|doi = 10.2307/3113341}}</ref>  Engerman's 5% figure gives as much as possible in terms of benefit of the doubt to the Williams argument, not solely because it does not take into account the associated costs of the slave trade to Britain, but also because it carries the full-employment assumption from economics and holds the gross value of slave trade profits as a direct contribution to Britain's national income.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade and British Capital Formation in the Eighteenth Century\">{{cite journal|author=Stanley L.

[[Zanzibar]] became a leading port in this trade. Arab slave traders differed from European ones in that they would often conduct raiding expeditions themselves, sometimes penetrating deep into the continent. They also differed in that their market greatly preferred the purchase of female slaves over male ones. {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe increased presence of European rivals along the East coast led Arab traders to concentrate on the overland slave caravan routes across the [[Sahara]] from the [[Sahel]] to North Africa. The German explorer [[Gustav Nachtigal]] reported seeing slave caravans departing from [[Kukawa]] in [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]] bound for [[Tripoli]] and [[Egypt]] in 1870.

Ships having landed slaves in [[Caribbean]] ports would take on sugar, indigo, raw cotton, and later coffee, and make for [[Liverpool]], [[Nantes]], Lisbon or [[Amsterdam]]. Ships leaving European ports for West Africa would carry printed cotton textiles, some originally from India, copper utensils and bangles, pewter plates and pots, iron bars more valued than gold, hats, trinkets, gunpowder and firearms and alcohol. Tropical [[shipworm]]s were eliminated in the cold Atlantic waters, and at each unloading, a profit was made.\n\nThe [[Atlantic slave trade]] peaked in the late 18th century when the largest number of slaves were captured on raiding expeditions into the interior of West Africa. These expeditions were typically carried out by African states, such as the [[Oyo empire]] ([[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]), [[Kong Empire]], [[Kingdom of Benin]], [[Imamate of Futa Jallon]], [[Imamate of Futa Toro]], [[Kingdom of Koya]], [[Kingdom of Khasso]], [[Kaabu|Kingdom of Kaabu]], [[Fante Confederacy]], [[Ashanti Confederacy]], [[Aro Confederacy]] and the kingdom of [[Dahomey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/slav/hd_slav.htm |title=The Transatlantic Slave Trade |publisher=Metmuseum.org |accessdate=4 December 2011}}</ref> Europeans rarely entered the interior of Africa, due to fear of [[tropical diseases|disease]] and moreover fierce African resistance. The slaves were brought to coastal outposts where they were traded for goods. The people captured on these expeditions were shipped by European traders to the colonies of the [[New World]]. As a result of the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the United Kingdom obtained the monopoly (''[[asiento de negros]]'') of transporting captive Africans to [[Spanish America]]. It is estimated that over the centuries, twelve to twenty million people were shipped as slaves from Africa by European traders, of whom some 15 percent died during the terrible voyage, many during the arduous journey through the [[Middle Passage]]. The great majority were shipped to the Americas, but some also went to Europe and Southern Africa.\n\n[[File:Slaves ruvuma.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Arab slave trade]]rs and their captives along the Ruvuma river (in today's Tanzania and Mozambique), 19th-century drawing by [[David Livingstone]].]]\nWhile talking about the slave trade in [[East Africa]] in his journals, \"To overdraw its evil is a simple impossibility.\"{{quote|To overdraw its evil is a simple impossibility.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lastjournalsdav03livigoog|quote=To overdraw its evils is a simple impossibility.|title= The Last Journals of David Livingstone in Central Africa, from 1865 to His Death: Continued by a Narrative of His Last Moments and Sufferings, Obtained from His Faithful Servants, Chuma and Susi|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1875|accessdate=25 April 2019|page=[https://archive.org/details/lastjournalsdav03livigoog/page/n376 352]}}</ref>}}\n\n[[David Livingstone]] while travelling in the [[African Great Lakes]] Region in 1866 described a trail of slaves as such:\n<blockquote>19th June 1866 \u2013 We passed a woman tied by the neck to a tree and dead, the people of the country explained that she had been unable to keep up with the other slaves in a gang, and her master had determined that she should not become anyone's property if she recovered.<br>26th June. \u2013 ...We passed a slave woman shot or stabbed through the body and lying on the path: a group of men stood about a hundred yards off on one side, and another of the women on the other side, looking on; they said an Arab who passed early that morning had done it in anger at losing the price he had given for her, because she was unable to walk any longer.<br>\n27th June 1866 \u2013 To-day we came upon a man dead from starvation, as he was very thin.

However, as the Atlantic slave trade increased its demand, local systems which primarily serviced indentured servitude expanded. European slave trading, as a result, was the most pivotal change in the social, economic, cultural, spiritual, religious, political dynamics of the concept of slave trading. It ultimately undermined local economies and political stability as villages' vital labour forces were shipped overseas as [[slave raid]]s and civil wars became commonplace.

The [[Royal Navy]] was deployed to prevent slavers from the [[United States]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Holland]], [[West Africa]] and [[Arabia]].

That is the verdict of our oracle and the priests. They say that your country, however great, can never stop a trade ordained by God himself.</blockquote>\n\nJoseph Miller states that African buyers would prefer males, but in reality, women and children would be more easily captured as men fled. Those captured would be sold for various reasons such as food, debts, or servitude. Once captured, the journey to the coast killed many and weakened others. Disease engulfed many, and insufficient food damaged those who made it to the coasts. Scurvy was so common that it was known as ''mal de Luanda'' (Luanda sickness).<ref name=\"Miller, Joseph 1988. p 380-387\">Miller, Joseph. \"West Central Africa.\" The Way of Death. University of Wisconsin. 1988. pp. 380\u201387, 389\u201391, 398\u2013405, 440\u201341.</ref> The assumption for those who died on the journey died from malnutrition. As food was limited, water may have been just as bad. Dysentery was widespread and poor sanitary conditions at ports did not help. Since supplies were poor, slaves were not equipped with the best clothing that further exposed to more diseases.<ref name=\"Miller, Joseph 1988. p 380-387\"/>\n\nIf the fear of disease caused terror, the psyche of slaves for being captured was just as terrifying. The most popular assumption for being captured was Europeans were cannibals. Stories and rumours spread that whites captured Africans to eat them.<ref name=\"Miller, Joseph 1988. p 380-387\"/> Olaudah Equiano accounts his experience about the sorrow slaves encountered at the ports. He talks about his first moment on a [[slave ship]] and asked if he was going to be eaten.<ref>Equiano, Olaudah. The Life of Olaudah Equiano or Gustavus Vassa: The African. Publisher Isaac Knapp. Boston. 1837. Chapter 2.</ref> Yet, the worst for slaves has only begun, and the journey on the water proved to be more terrifying. For every 100 Africans captured, only 64 would reach the coast, and only about 50 would reach the New World.<ref name=\"Miller, Joseph 1988. p 380-387\"/>\n\nOthers believe that slavers had a vested interest in capturing rather than killing, and in keeping their captives alive; and that this coupled with the disproportionate removal of males and the introduction of new crops from the Americas ([[cassava]], maize) would have limited general [[population decline]] to particular regions of western Africa around 1760\u20131810, and in [[Mozambique]] and neighbouring areas half a century later. There has also been speculation that within Africa, females were most often [[Bride kidnapping|captured as brides]], with their male protectors being a \"bycatch\" who would have been killed if there had not been an export market for them.\n\nBritish explorer [[Mungo Park (explorer)|Mungo Park]] encountered a group of slaves when traveling through [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] country:\n\n{{Blockquote|They were all very inquisitive, but they viewed me at first with looks of horror, and repeatedly asked if my countrymen were cannibals. They were very desirous to know what became of the slaves after they had crossed the salt water. I told them that they were employed in cultivation the land; but they would not believe me ... A deeply-rooted idea that the whites purchase negroes for the purpose of devouring them, or of selling them to others that they may be devoured hereafter, naturally makes the slaves contemplate a journey towards the coast with great terror, insomuch that the slatees are forced to keep them constantly in irons, and watch them very closely, to prevent their escape.<ref>Mungo Park, ''[http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/p/park/mungo/travels/chapter24.html Travels in the Interior Districts of Africa, 1795\u20137]''</ref>}}\n\nDuring the period from the late 19th century and early 20th century, demand for the labour-intensive harvesting of rubber drove frontier expansion and [[forced labour]].

I then asked where were their women? Had they any like themselves? I was told that they had. \"And why,\" said I, \"do we not see them?\" They answered, because they were left behind. I asked how the vessel could go? They told me they could not tell; but that there was cloth put upon the masts by the help of the ropes I saw, and then the vessel went on; and the white men had some spell or magic they put in the water when they liked, in order to stop the vessel. I was exceedingly amazed at this account, and really thought they were spirits. I there-fore wished much to be from amongst them, for I expected they would sacrifice me; but my wishes were vain\u2014for we were so quartered that it was impossible for any of us to make our escape. </blockquote><ref name=\"Smallwood, Stephanie E 2008\">Smallwood, Stephanie E. Saltwater Slavery: A Middle Passage from Africa to American Diaspora. 1st Harvard University Press pbk. ed. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2008.</ref>\nAccounts like these raised many questions as some slaves grew philosophical with their journey. Smallwood points out the challenges for slaves were physical and metaphysical. The physical would be obvious as the challenge to overcome capacity, lack of ship room, and food. The metaphysical was unique as the open sea would challenge African slaves' vision of the ocean as habitable.<ref name=\"Smallwood, Stephanie E 2008\"/>\nAt essence, the journey on the ocean would prove to be an African's biggest fear that would keep them in awe. Combining this with the lack of knowledge of the sea, Africans would be entering a world of anxiety never seen before. Yet, Europeans were also fearful of the sea, but not to the extent of Africans. One of these dilemmas came with the sense of time. Africans used seasonal weather to predict time and days. The moon was a sense of time, but used like in other cultures. On the sea, Africans used the moon to best count the days, but the sea did not provide seasonal changes for them to know how long they were at sea.<ref name=\"Smallwood, Stephanie E 2008\"/>\nCounting the days on a ship was not the main priority, however. Surviving the voyage was the main horror. No one escaped diseases as the close quarters infected everyone including the crew. Death was so common that ships were called ''tumbeiros'' or floating tombs.<ref name=\"Smallwood, Stephanie E 2008\"/> What shocked Africans the most was how death was handled in the ships. Smallwood says the traditions for an African death was delicate and community-based. On ships, bodies would be thrown into the sea. Because the sea represented bad omens, bodies in the sea represented a form of purgatory and the ship a form of hell. In the end, the Africans who made the journey would have survived disease, malnutrition, confined space, close death, and the trauma of the ship.\n\n===North Africa===\n{{main|Barbary slave trade}}\n[[File:Debarquement et maltraitement de prisonniers a alger.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire|Christian slaves]] in Algiers, 1706]]\nIn [[Algiers]] during the time of the [[Regency of Algiers]] in North Africa in the 19th century, 1.5 million [[Christians]] and [[Europe]]ans were captured and forced into slavery.<ref>{{Cite book|title=White Gold: The Extraordinary Story of Thomas Pellow and Islam's One Million White Slaves|last=Milton|first=Giles|date=8 June 2005|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0374289355|edition=1st American|language=English|url=https://archive.org/details/whitegoldextraor00milt}}</ref> This eventually led to the [[Bombardment of Algiers (1816)|Bombardment of Algiers]] in 1816 by the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]], forcing the [[Dey of Algiers]] to free many slaves.<ref>Baepler, B. \"White Slaves, African Masters 1st Edition.\" White Slaves, African Masters 1st Edition by Baepler.

In Brazil, the Maroon villages were called [[Palenque (village)|palenques]] or [[quilombo]]s. Maroons survived by growing vegetables and hunting.

Besides moral qualms, the low cost of slave-produced Brazilian sugar meant that British colonies in the West Indies were unable to match the market prices of Brazilian sugar, and each Briton was consuming 16&nbsp;pounds (7&nbsp;kg) of sugar a year by the 19th century. This combination led to intensive pressure from the British government for Brazil to end this practice, which it did by steps over several decades.<ref>Leslie Bethell, ''The Abolition of the Brazilian Slave Trade: Britain, Brazil and the Slave Trade Question'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009)</ref>\n\nFirst, foreign slave trade was banned in 1850. Then, in 1871, the sons of the slaves were freed. In 1885, slaves aged over 60 years were freed. The [[Paraguayan War]] contributed to ending slavery as many slaves enlisted in exchange for freedom. In Colonial Brazil, slavery was more a social than a racial condition. Some of the greatest figures of the time, like the writer [[Machado de Assis]] and the engineer [[Andr\u00e9 Rebou\u00e7as]] had black ancestry.\n\nBrazil's 1877\u201378 [[Grande Seca]] (Great Drought) in the cotton-growing northeast led to major turmoil, starvation, poverty and internal migration. As wealthy plantation holders rushed to sell their slaves south, popular resistance and resentment grew, inspiring numerous emancipation societies. They succeeded in banning slavery altogether in the province of Cear\u00e1 by 1884.<ref>Mike Davis, ''Late Victorian Holocausts'', 88\u201390</ref> Slavery was legally ended nationwide on 13 May by the ''[[Lei \u00c1urea]]'' (\"Golden Law\") of 1888.

These newly freed servants were rarely able to support themselves comfortably, and the tobacco industry was increasingly dominated by large planters. This caused domestic unrest culminating in [[Bacon's Rebellion]]. Eventually, chattel slavery became the norm in regions dominated by plantations.\n\nThe [[Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina]] established a model in which a rigid social hierarchy placed slaves under the absolute authority of their master. With the rise of a plantation economy in the [[Carolina Lowcountry]] based on rice cultivation, a slave society was created that later became the model for the [[King Cotton]] economy across the [[Deep South]]. The model created by South Carolina was driven by the emergence of a majority slave population that required repressive and often brutal force to control. Justification for such a slave society developed into a conceptual framework of white superiority and aristocratic privilege.<ref>Wilson, Thomas D.

Slavery in Canada was largely ended by judicial court decisions by the early nineteenth century. Refugees from slavery fled the South across the Ohio River to the North via the [[Underground Railroad]]. Midwestern state governments asserted [[States Rights]] arguments to refuse federal jurisdiction over fugitives. Some juries exercised their right of [[jury nullification]] and refused to convict those indicted under the [[Fugitive Slave Act of 1850]].\n\nAfter the passage of the [[Kansas\u2013Nebraska Act]] in 1854, armed conflict broke out in [[Kansas Territory]], where the question of whether it would be admitted to the Union as a slave state or a free state had been left to the inhabitants. The radical abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was active in the mayhem and killing in \"[[Bleeding Kansas]].\" The true turning point in public opinion is better fixed at the [[Lecompton Constitution]] fraud. Pro-slavery elements in Kansas had arrived first from Missouri and quickly organized a territorial government that excluded abolitionists. Through the machinery of the territory and violence, the pro-slavery faction attempted to force an unpopular pro-slavery constitution through the state. This infuriated Northern Democrats, who supported popular sovereignty, and was exacerbated by the [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]] administration reneging on a promise to submit the constitution to a referendum\u2014which would surely fail. Anti-slavery legislators took office under the banner of the newly formed [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The Supreme Court in the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' decision]] of 1857 asserted that one could take one's property anywhere, even if one's property was [[Chattel slavery|chattel]] and one crossed into a free territory. It also asserted that African Americans could not be federal citizens. Outraged critics across the North denounced these episodes as the latest of the [[Slave Power]] (the politically organized slave owners) taking more control of the nation.<ref>Leonard L.

The central issue in politics in the 1850s involved the extension of slavery into the western territories, which settlers from the Northern states opposed. The Whig Party split and collapsed on the slavery issue, to be replaced in the North by [[History of the United States Republican Party|the new Republican Party]], which was dedicated to stopping the expansion of slavery. Republicans gained a majority in every northern state by [[Free Soil Party|absorbing a faction of anti-slavery Democrats]], and warning that slavery was a backward system that undercut democracy and economic modernization.<ref>Eric Foner, ''Free soil, free labor, free men: The ideology of the Republican party before the civil war'' (1971).</ref>  Numerous compromise proposals were put forward, but they all collapsed. A majority of Northern voters were committed to stopping the expansion of slavery, which they believed would ultimately end slavery. Southern voters were overwhelmingly angry that they were being treated as second-class citizens. In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1860|election of 1860]], the Republicans swept [[Abraham Lincoln]] into the Presidency and his party took control (with only 39.8% of the popular vote) and legislators into Congress. The states of the deep South, convinced that the economic power of what they called \"[[King Cotton]]\" would overwhelm the North and win support from Europe voted to seceded from the U.S. (the Union). They formed the [[Confederate States of America]], based on the promise of maintaining slavery. War broke out in April 1861, as both sides sought wave after wave of enthusiasm among young men volunteering to form new regiments and new armies. In the North, the main goal was to preserve the union as an expression of American nationalism.\n[[File:Company I of the 36th Colored Regiment.jpg|thumb|Company I of the 36th Colored Regiment [[United States Colored Troops|USCT]]]]\n\nBy 1862 most northern leaders realized that the mainstay of Southern secession, slavery, had to be attacked head-on. All the border states rejected President Lincoln's proposal for compensated emancipation. However, by 1865 all had begun the abolition of slavery, except Kentucky and Delaware. The [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was an executive order issued by Lincoln on 1 January 1863. In a single stroke, it changed the legal status, as recognized by the U.S. government, of 3 million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from \"slave\" to \"free.\" It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of the Confederate government, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave became legally and actually free. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and liberated all of the designated slaves. The owners were never compensated.<ref>Michael Vorenberg, ed.

By 1900 they also lost the right to vote. They had become second class citizens. The great majority lived in the rural South in poverty working as laborers, sharecroppers or tenant farmers; a small proportion owned their own land.

Such oppression by an elite minority eventually led to [[slave revolts]]; the [[Third Servile War]] led by [[Spartacus]] was the most famous and severe.

If a slave ran away, they were liable to be [[crucified]].\n\nThe overall impact of slavery on the Italian genetics was insignificant though, because the slaves imported in Italy were native Europeans, and very few if any of them had extra European origin. This has been further confirmed by recent biochemical analysis of 166 skeletons from three non-elite imperial-era cemeteries in the vicinity of Rome (where the bulk of the slaves lived), which shows that only 1 individual definitely came from outside of Europe (North Africa), and another 2 possibly did, but results are inconclusive.

Initially the Dutch shipped slaves to northern Brazil, and during the second half of the 17th century they had a controlling interest in the trade to the Spanish colonies. Today's Suriname and Guyana became prominent markets in the 18th century. Between 1612 and 1872, the Dutch operated from some 10 fortresses along the Gold Coast (now Ghana), from which slaves were shipped across the Atlantic.  Dutch involvement on the Slave Coast increased with the establishment of a trading post in [[Offra]] in 1660. [[Willem Bosman]] writes in his ''Nauwkeurige beschrijving van de Guinese Goud- Tand- en Slavekust'' (1703) that Allada was also called Grand Ardra, being the larger cousin of Little Ardra, also known as [[Offra]].

According to a 1670 report, annually 2,500 to 3,000 slaves were transported from Offra to the Americas. These numbers were only feasible in times of peace, however, and dwindled in time of conflict. From 1688 onward, the struggle between the [[Aja people|Aja]] king of Allada and the peoples on the coastal regions, impeded the supply of slaves. The Dutch West India Company chose the side of the Aja king, causing the Offra office to be destroyed by opposing forces in 1692.  By 1650 the Dutch had the pre-eminent slave trade in Europe and South East Asia. Later, trade shifted to [[Ouidah]].  On the instigation of Governor-General of the [[Dutch Gold Coast]] Willem de la Palma, [[Jacob van den Broucke]] was sent in 1703 as \"opperkommies\" (head merchant) to the Dutch trading post at [[Ouidah]], which according to sources was established around 1670.<ref name=\"AMH-Ouidah\">{{cite web|url=http://www.atlasofmutualheritage.nl/detail.aspx?page=dpost&lang=nl&id=819#tab2|title=Plaats: Ouidah (Fida, Whydah, Juda, Hueda, Whidah)|author=Atlas of Mutual Heritage|accessdate=6 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504150011/http://www.atlasofmutualheritage.nl/detail.aspx?page=dpost&lang=nl&id=819#tab2|archivedate=4 May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Delepeleire3c2\">{{harvnb|Delepeleire|2004}}, section 3.c.2.</ref>  Political unrest caused the Dutch to abandon their trading post at Ouidah in 1725, and they then moved to [[Jaquim]], at which place they built [[Fort Zeelandia (Benin)|Fort Zeelandia]].<ref>P.C.

In an attempt to extend his trading area, Hertog negotiated with local tribes and mingled in local political struggles. He sided with the wrong party, however, leading to a conflict with Director-General [[Jan Pranger]] and to his exile to the island of Appa in 1732. The Dutch trading post on this island was extended as the new centre of the slave trade. In 1733, Hertog returned to Jaquim, this time extending the trading post into [[Fort Zeelandia (Benin)|Fort Zeelandia]]. The revival of the slave trade at Jaquim was only temporary, however, as his superiors at the Dutch West India Company noticed that Hertog's slaves were more expensive than at the Gold Coast.

He imposed peace between Algiers and the kingdoms of [[Piedmont-Sardinia|Sardinia]] and [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies|Sicily]].

The 1805 raid was by American sealers and was one of a series that changed the attitude of the islanders to outside visitors, with reports in the 1820s and 1830s that all visitors received a hostile reception. In December 1862, [[Peru]]vian slave raiders took between 1,400 and 2,000 islanders back to Peru to work in the [[guano]] industry; this was about a third of the island's population and included much of the island's leadership, the last ''ariki-mau'' and possibly the last who could read [[Rongorongo]]. After intervention by the French ambassador in [[Lima]], the last 15 survivors were returned to the island, but brought with them [[smallpox]], which further devastated the island.\n\n==Abolitionist movements==\n{{Main|Abolitionism}}\n[[File:Proclamation esclavage.jpg|thumb|Proclamation of the abolition of slavery by [[Victor Hugues]] in the [[Guadeloupe]], 1 November 1794]]\n\nSlavery has existed, in one form or another, throughout the whole of human history. So, too, have movements to free large or distinct groups of slaves. However, abolitionism should be distinguished from efforts to help a particular group of slaves, or to restrict one practice, such as the slave trade.\n\nDrescher (2009) provides a model for the history of the abolition of slavery, emphasizing its origins in Western Europe. Around the year 1500, slavery had virtually died out in Western Europe, but was a normal phenomenon practically everywhere else. The imperial powers \u2013 the British, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch, and [[Belgian Empire|Belgian]] empires, and a few others \u2013 built worldwide empires based primarily on plantation agriculture using slaves imported from Africa. However, the powers took care to minimize the presence of slavery in their homelands. In 1807 Britain and soon after, the United States also, both criminalized the international slave trade. The [[Royal Navy]] was increasingly effective in [[Blockade of Africa|intercepting slave ships]], freeing the captives and taking the crew for trial in courts.\n\nAlthough there were numerous slave revolts in the Caribbean, the only successful uprising came in the French colony of Haiti in the 1790s, where the slaves rose up, killed the [[mulattoes]] and whites, and established the independent Republic of Haiti. Europe recoiled in horror.\n\nThe continuing profitability of slave-based plantations and the threats of race war slowed the development of abolition movements during the first half of the 19th century. These movements were strongest in Britain, and after 1840 in the United States, in both instances, they were based on evangelical religious enthusiasm that said that owning a slave was a sin, and stressed the horrible impact on the slaves themselves. The Northern states of the United States abolished slavery, partly in response to the Declaration of Independence, between 1777 and 1804. Britain ended slavery in its empire in the 1830s. However, the plantation economies of the southern United States, based on cotton, and those in Brazil and Cuba, based on sugar, expanded and grew even more profitable. The bloody [[American Civil War]] ended slavery in the United States in 1865. The system ended in Cuba and Brazil in the 1880s because it was no longer profitable for the owners. Slavery continued to exist in Africa, where Arab slave traders raided black areas for new captives to be sold in the system. European colonial rule and diplomatic pressure slowly put an end to the trade, and eventually to the practice of slavery itself.<ref>Seymour Drescher, ''Abolition: A History of Slavery and Antislavery'' (Cambridge University Press, 2009)</ref>\n\n===Persian Empire===\n:''See [[slavery of Iran]]''\n[[Cyrus the Great]], the founder of [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]  prohibited the systematic enslavement of conquered non-combatant population.

The legal case of [[Jean Boucaux]] in 1739 clarified the unclear legal position of possible slaves in France, and was followed by laws that established registers for slaves in mainland France, who were limited to a three-year stay, for visits or learning a trade. Unregistered \"slaves\" in France were regarded as free. However, slavery was of vital importance in France's [[Caribbean]] possessions, especially [[Saint-Domingue]].\n\n====Abolition====\nIn 1793, influenced by the French [[Declaration of the Rights of Man]] of August 1789 and alarmed as the massive slave revolt of August 1791 that had become the [[Haitian Revolution]] threatened to ally itself with the British, the French Revolutionary commissioners [[Sonthonax]] and [[Polverel]] declared general emancipation to reconcile them with France. In Paris, on 4 February 1794, [[Abb\u00e9 Gr\u00e9goire]] and the [[Treaty|Convention]] ratified this action by officially abolishing slavery in all French territories outside mainland France, freeing all the slaves both for moral and security reasons.\n\n====Napoleon restores slavery====\n[[Napoleon]] came to power in 1799 and soon had grandiose plans for the French sugar colonies; to achieve them he reintroduced slavery.

Napoleon wanted to preserve France's financial benefits from the colony's sugar and coffee crops; he then planned to establish a major base at New Orleans. He therefore re-established slavery in Haiti and Guadeloupe, where it had been abolished after rebellions. Slaves and black freedmen fought the French for their freedom and independence.

Black history was promoted very largely at black colleges. The situation changed dramatically with the coming of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s. Attention shifted to the enslaved humans, the free blacks, and the struggles of the black community against adversity.<ref>August Meier, August, and Elliott M. Rudwick, eds.

Writing in 2005, the historian [[Eric Foner]] states:\n\n{{quote|Their account of the era rested, as one member of the Dunning school put it, on the assumption of \"negro incapacity.\" Finding it impossible to believe that blacks could ever be independent actors on the stage of history, with their own aspirations and motivations, Dunning et al. portrayed African Americans either as \"children\", ignorant dupes manipulated by unscrupulous whites, or as savages, their primal passions unleashed by the end of slavery.<ref>{{cite book|author=Eric Foner|title=Forever Free: The Story of Emancipation and Reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BfC7FbdXgxIC&pg=PR22|year=2013|publisher=Knopf Doubleday|page=xxii|isbn=978-0307834584}}</ref>}}\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, historiography moved away from the tone of the Phillips era. Historians still emphasized the slave as an object. Whereas Phillips presented the slave as the object of benign attention by the owners, historians such as [[Kenneth Stampp]] emphasized the mistreatment and abuse of the slave.<ref>Kolchin p. 135. David and Temin p. 741. The latter authors wrote, \"The vantage point correspondingly shifted from that of the master to that of his slave. The reversal culminated in Kenneth M. Stampp's ''The Peculiar Institution'' (1956), which rejected both the characterization of blacks as a biologically and culturally inferior, childlike people, and the depiction of the white planters as paternal [[Cavaliers]] coping with a vexing social problem that was not of their own making.\"</ref>\n\nIn the portrayal of the slave as a victim, the historian [[Stanley M. Elkins]] in his 1959 work ''Slavery: A Problem in American Institutional and Intellectual Life'' compared the effects of United States slavery to that resulting from the brutality of the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. He stated the institution destroyed the will of the slave, creating an \"emasculated, docile [[Sambo (racial term)|Sambo]]\" who identified totally with the owner. Elkins' thesis was challenged by historians. Gradually historians recognized that in addition to the effects of the owner-slave relationship, slaves did not live in a \"totally closed environment but rather in one that permitted the emergence of enormous variety and allowed slaves to pursue important relationships with persons other than their master, including those to be found in their families, churches and communities.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter Kolchin|title=American Slavery: 1619\u20131877|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FaffAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA136|year=2003|page=136|isbn=978-0809016303}}</ref>\n\nEconomic historians [[Robert W. Fogel]] and [[Stanley L. Engerman]] in the 1970s, through their work ''Time on the Cross'', portrayed slaves as having internalized the [[Protestant work ethic]] of their owners.<ref>Kolchin p. 136</ref> In portraying the more benign version of slavery, they also argue in their 1974 book that the material conditions under which the slaves lived and worked compared favorably to those of free workers in the agriculture and industry of the time. (This was also an argument of Southerners during the 19th century.)\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, historians made use of sources such as black music and statistical census data to create a more detailed and nuanced picture of slave life. Relying also on 19th-century autobiographies of ex-slaves (known as [[slave narratives]]) and the WPA [[Slave Narrative Collection]], a set of interviews conducted with former slaves in the 1930s by the [[Federal Writers' Project]], historians described slavery as the slaves remembered it. Far from slaves' being strictly victims or content, historians showed slaves as both resilient and autonomous in many of their activities. Despite their exercise of autonomy and their efforts to make a life within slavery, current historians recognize the precariousness of the slave's situation. Slave children quickly learned that they were subject to the direction of both their parents and their owners. They saw their parents disciplined just as they came to realize that they also could be physically or verbally abused by their owners. Historians writing during this era include [[John Blassingame]] (''Slave Community''), [[Eugene Genovese]] (''Roll, Jordan, Roll''), [[Leslie Howard Owens]] (''This Species of Property''), and [[Herbert Gutman]] (''The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom'').<ref>Kolchin pp. 137\u201343.

In 2010, [[Robert E. Wright]] published a [[Conceptual model|model]] that explains why [[slavery]] was more prevalent in some areas than others (e.g. southern than northern [[Delaware]]) and why some [[firms]] (individuals, [[corporations]], plantation owners) chose [[slave labor]] while others used wage, indentured, or family labor instead.<ref name=\"Robert E.

In the 18th-century British merchant ships were the largest element in the \"Middle Passage\" which transported millions of slaves to the Western Hemisphere. Most of those who survived the journey wound up in the Caribbean, where the Empire had highly profitable sugar colonies, and the living conditions were bad (the plantation owners lived in Britain). Parliament ended the international transportation of slaves in 1807 and used the Royal Navy to enforce that ban. In 1833 it bought out the plantation owners and banned slavery. Historians before the 1940s argued that moralistic reformers such as [[William Wilberforce]] were primarily responsible.<ref>Frank Joseph Klingberg, ''The anti-slavery movement in England: a study in English humanitarianism'' (Yale University Press, 1926)</ref>\n\n[[Historical revisionism]] arrived when West Indian historian [[Eric Williams]], a Marxist, in ''Capitalism and Slavery'' (1944), rejected this moral explanation and argued that abolition was now more profitable, for a century of sugarcane raising had exhausted the soil of the islands, and the plantations had become unprofitable. It was more profitable to sell the slaves to the government than to keep up operations. The 1807 prohibition of the international trade, Williams argued, prevented French expansion on other islands. Meanwhile, British investors turned to Asia, where labor was so plentiful that slavery was unnecessary. Williams went on to argue that slavery played a major role in making Britain prosperous. The high profits from the slave trade, he said, helped finance the [[Industrial Revolution]].

Ward, \"The British West Indies in the Age of Abolition,\" in P.J. Marshall, ed. ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume II: The Eighteenth Century'' (1998) pp. 415\u201339.</ref> Richardson (1998) finds Williams's claims regarding the Industrial Revolution are exaggerated, for profits from the slave trade amounted to less than 1% of domestic investment in Britain. Richardson further challenges claims (by African scholars) that the slave trade caused widespread depopulation and economic distress in Africa\u2014indeed that it caused the \"underdevelopment\" of Africa. Admitting the horrible suffering of slaves, he notes that many Africans benefited directly because the first stage of the trade was always firmly in the hands of Africans. European slave ships waited at ports to purchase cargoes of people who were captured in the hinterland by African dealers and tribal leaders. Richardson finds that the \"terms of trade\" (how much the ship owners paid for the slave cargo) moved heavily in favor of the Africans after about 1750. That is, indigenous elites inside West and Central Africa made large and growing profits from slavery, thus increasing their wealth and power.<ref>David Richardson, \"The British Empire and the Atlantic Slave Trade, 1660\u20131807,\" in P.J. Marshall, ed. ''The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume II: The Eighteenth Century'' (1998) pp. 440\u201364.</ref>\n\nEconomic historian [[Stanley Engerman]] finds that even without subtracting the associated costs of the slave trade (e.g., shipping costs, slave mortality, mortality of British people in Africa, defense costs) or reinvestment of profits back into the slave trade, the total profits from the slave trade and of West Indian plantations amounted to less than 5% of the [[Economic history of the United Kingdom|British economy]] during any year of the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3113341|title = The Slave Trade and British Capital Formation in the Eighteenth Century: A Comment on the Williams Thesis|journal = The Business History Review|volume = 46|issue = 4|pages = 430\u2013443|last1 = Engerman|first1 = Stanley L.|year = 1972|doi = 10.2307/3113341}}</ref>  Engerman's 5% figure gives as much as possible in terms of benefit of the doubt to the Williams argument, not solely because it does not take into account the associated costs of the slave trade to Britain, but also because it carries the full-employment assumption from economics and holds the gross value of slave trade profits as a direct contribution to Britain's national income.<ref name=\"The Slave Trade and British Capital Formation in the Eighteenth Century\">{{cite journal|author=Stanley L.
