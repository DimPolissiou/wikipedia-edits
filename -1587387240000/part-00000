She laments the current state of the Irish people and predicts an imminent revival of their fortunes, usually linked to the return of the [[Roman Catholic]] [[House of Stuart]] to the thrones of Britain and Ireland.\n\nThe form developed out of an earlier, non-political genre akin to the [[French poetry|French]] ''[[reverdie]]'', in which the poet meets a beautiful, supernatural woman who symbolises the spring season, the bounty of nature, and love.\n\nThe first<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Connolly |first=S.J. |encyclopedia=Oxford Companion to Irish History |edition=2nd |article=Literature in Irish}}</ref> of the aisling poets was [[Aodhag\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille]], \"athair na haislinge\" ('father of the aisling'). In his hands, the aisling is a powerful mode of political writing. Also famed for his works in the genre is [[Eoghan Rua \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in]].\n\nAmong the most famous examples of Aisling poetry are ''Gile na gile'' by \u00d3 Rathaille and ''Ceo dra\u00edochta i gcoim o\u00edche'' by \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in.\n\n==Satire==\n\nIn 1751, Scottish [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] poet [[Alasdair MacMhaighstir Alasdair]] poked fun at the aisling genre in his Anti-[[Clan Campbell|Campbell]] polemic ''[[An Airce]]'' (\"The Ark\"). At the poem's beginning, the bard describes a meeting with the ghost of a beheaded Campbell Jacobite who then tells him that the Clan will soon be punished for committing [[high treason]] against their lawful King, first being visited by the [[Ten Plagues of Egypt]] and then by another [[Great Flood]] upon their lands.\n\nThe poet is instructed to emulate [[Noah]] by building another [[Noah's Ark|Ark]] for carefully selected Campbell Jacobites. The moderates will be welcomed aboard the Ark's decks after being purged of their Whiggery by swallowing a dose of seawater.

A female poet of the clan who had mocked Prince Charles and accused him of illegitimacy was to be treated to a fitting punishment before being delivered right into the poet's mercy.\n\n{|\n|\n: ''Ma Thig a bhan-bh\u00e1rd na d'lionamh''\n: ''Ostag mh\u00edo-narach an<!--not a mistake--> an Obain,''\n: ''Ceanagail achdair r'i do bhrandi,''\n: ''Go bi toirt dram do'n a r\u00f3namh:''\n\n: ''Ach ma chinnis i na Jonah\n: '''S a sluggadh beo le muic-mhara:''\n: ''Go meal i a cairstealan fhe\u00f3lain;''\n: ''Ach a sgeith air c\u00f3rsa Chana.''\n|\n: \"If the poetess comes into your nets,\n: The shameless little female pub-keeper from [[Oban]],\n: Tie an anchor of brandy to her\n: To give a dram to the seals.\n\n: \"But if she becomes a [[Jonah]],\n: And is swallowed alive by a whale,\n: May she enjoy her fleshy quarters\n: Provided she be spewed up on the coast of [[Canna, Scotland|Canna]].\"<ref>John Lorne Campbell, \"Canna; Story of a Hebridean Island,\" page 104.</ref>\n|\n|}\n\nDuring the 1780s, [[Munster]] poet [[Brian Merriman]] also parodied the Aisling genre in his comic masterpiece ''C\u00fairt An Mhe\u00e1n O\u00edche'' (\"The Midnight Court\"). In the opening section of the poem, a hideous female giant appears to the bard and drags him kicking and screaming to the court of Queen [[Aibell|Aoibheal]] of the Fairies. On the way to the ruined [[monastery]] at [[Moinmoy]], the messenger explains that the Queen, disgusted by the twin corruptions of [[Anglo-Irish]] landlords and [[English Law]], has taken the dispensing of justice upon herself. There follows a traditional court case under the [[Brehon law]] form of a three-part debate.\n\nIn the first part, a young woman declares her case against the young men of Ireland for their refusal to marry. She complains that, despite increasingly desperate attempts to capture a husband via intensive flirtation at [[hurling]] matches, [[wake (ceremony)|wake]]s, and [[pattern (devotional)|pattern days]], the young men insist on ignoring her in favour of late marriages to much older women. The young woman further bewails the contempt with which she is treated by the married women of the village.\n\nShe is answered by an old man who first denounces the wanton [[promiscuity]] of young women in general, suggesting that the young woman who spoke before was conceived by a [[Irish Traveller|Tinker]] under a cart. He vividly describes the [[infidelity]] of his own young wife. He declares his humiliation at finding her already pregnant on their wedding night and the gossip which has surrounded the \"premature\" birth of \"his\" son ever since. He disgustedly attacks the dissolute lifestyles of young women in general. Then, however, he declares that there is nothing wrong with his [[illegitimate child]]ren and denounces marriage as \"out of date.\" He demands that the Queen outlaw it altogether and replace it with a system of [[free love]].\n\nThe young woman, however, is infuriated by the old man's words and is barely restrained from physically attacking him. She mocks his inability to fulfill his marital duties with his young wife, saying that she was a homeless beggar who married him to avoid starvation. She vividly argues that if his wife has taken a lover, she well deserves one. She then calls for the abolition of [[priestly celibacy]], alleging that priests would otherwise make wonderful husbands and fathers. In the meantime, however, she will keep trying to attract an older man in hopes that her unmarried humiliation will finally end.\n\nFinally, in the judgement section Queen Aoibheal rules that all laymen must marry before the age of 21, on pain of [[corporal punishment]] at the hands of Ireland's women. She advises them to equally target the romantically indifferent, men-loving men, and unmarried skirt chasers who boast of the number of notches on their belts. Aoibheal tells them to be careful, however, not to leave any man unable to father children. She also states that abolishing priestly celibacy is beyond her mandate and counsels patience.\n\nTo the poet's horror, the younger woman angrily points him out as a 30-year-old [[bachelor]] and describes her many failed attempts to attract his interest in hopes of becoming his wife. She declares that he must be the first man to suffer the consequences of the new marriage law. As a crowd of infuriated women prepares to flog him into a quivering bowl of jelly, he awakens to find it was all a terrible nightmare.\n\n==Other uses==\n* [[L\u00c9 Aisling (P23)|L\u00c9 ''Aisling'' (P23)]] is a ship which was in the [[Irish Naval Service]] from 1980 to 2016.\n* \"Aisling\" is a poem by [[Seamus Heaney]] from the collection ''[[North (poetry collection)|North]]'' (1975).\n* The acclaimed Irish author [[Ciaran Carson]] has said that much of his literature is based around the idea of the aisling, or dream vision.\n* \"Aisling\" is a poem by [[Paul Muldoon]] from his 1983 collection ''Quoof''.\n* In the 2009 film '[[The Secret of Kells]]', one main character is a forest fairy called 'Aisling' and her cat is called [[Pangur B\u00e1n]].\n* Aisling Gh\u00e9ar by [[Breand\u00e1n \u00d3 Buachalla]], a 20th century Aisling poet.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aisling (given name)]] \u2013 includes a list of people with this name\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040706031531/http://www.fainne.org/danlann/gnag.html Irish text of ''Gile na Gile'' by Aodhag\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20040902220649/http://www.fainne.org/danlann/cill.html Irish text of  '' \u00dairchill an Chreag\u00e1in'', an 18th century aisling from Ulster]\n* [http://medievalscotland.org/problem/names/aislinn.shtml Medieval roots of the name Aisling disputed]\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzA-VK9wpTg Video of Breand\u00e1n \u00d3 Buachalla on YouTube explaining the Aisling poetic genre.]\n\n{{Irish poetry}}\n{{National personifications}}\n\n[[Category:Irish-language literature]]\n[[Category:Irish language]]\n[[Category:Genres of poetry]]\n[[Category:Irish words and phrases]]\n[[Category:Jacobite poets]]\n[[Category:Jacobite propagandists]]\n[[Category:Personifications of Ireland]]\n[[Category:National personifications]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the given name|Aisling (name)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n [[File:Pierre-C\u00e9cile Puvis de Chavannes 003.jpg|thumb|240px|right|[[Pierre Puvis de Chavannes|Pierre-C\u00e9cile Puvis de Chavannes]]: ''An Aisling'', 1883]]\n\nThe '''aisling''' (Irish for 'dream, vision', {{IPA-ga|\u02c8a\u0283l\u02b2\u026a\u014b|pron}}), or vision poem, is a [[poetic genre]] that developed during the late 17th and 18th centuries in [[Irish language]] [[Irish poetry|poetry]].

Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies.\n\nExamples of products sold through B2B marketing include:\n\n* Major equipment\n* Accessory equipment\n* Raw materials\n* Component parts\n* Processed materials\n* Supplies\n* Business services<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:\n\n* Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)\n* Resellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\n* Governments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\n* Institutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use) <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== B2C marketing ===\nBusiness-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\n\nTraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Business News Daily Editor, Exp |title=What is B2C? |url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5085-what-is-b2c.html |website=Business News Daily |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== C2B marketing ===\nConsumer-to-business marketing, or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposite to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.\n\n=== C2C marketing ===\n[[Customer to customer]] marketing, or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tarver |first1=Evan |title=Customer to Customer \u2013 C2C |url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/ctoc.asp |website=Investopedia |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Differences in B2B and B2C marketing ===\nThe different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, number of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n*Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customers wants and needs. B2C demand is primary because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Purchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Orientations ==\n{{main|History of marketing#Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice}}\nA marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\"<ref name=\":5\">Mc Namara (1972) cited in Deshpande, R., ''Developing a Market Orientation,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 1999, p. 11</ref> or \"a corporate state of mind\"<ref>Kohli, A.K. and Jaworski, B.J., \"Market Orientation: The Construct, Research Propositions, and Managerial Implications,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 54, April 1990, pp. 1\u201318</ref> or as an \"organisation[al] culture\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Narver | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Slater | first2 = S.F. | year = | title = The Effect of a Market Orientation on Business Profitability | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 20\u201334 | doi = 10.2307/1251757 }}</ref> Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific orientations that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hollander | first1 = S.C. | last2 = Jones | first2 = D.G.B. | last3 = Dix | first3 = L. | year = | title = Periodization in Marketing History | url = | journal = Journal of Macromarketing | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 33\u201339 | doi = 10.1177/0276146705274982 }}</ref>\n\n===Product===\nA firm employing a product orientation is mainly concerned with the quality of its product. A product orientation is based on the assumption that all things being equal, consumers will purchase products of superior quality. The approach is most effective when the firm has deep insights into customer needs and desires as derived from research or intuition and understands consumer's quality expectations and price consumers are willing to pay. Although the product orientation has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, firms practicing a product orientation can still be found in haute couture and arts marketing.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1362/146934706776861573|title = Art for Art's Sake or Art for Business Sake: An exploration of artistic product orientation| journal=The Marketing Review| volume=6| pages=29\u201340|year = 2006|last1 = Fillis|first1 = Ian}}</ref><ref>Sheth, J., Sisodia, R.S. and Sharma, A., \"The Antecedents and Consequences of Customer-Centric Marketing,\" ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 28, No. 1, 2000, p. 55</ref>\n\n===Sales===\n{{See|History of marketing#Selling orientation}}\n\nA sales orientation focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants.

A production orientation may be deployed when a high demand for a product or service exists, coupled with certainty that consumer tastes and preferences remain relatively constant (similar to the sales orientation). The so-called production era is thought to have dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28</ref> \n\n===Marketing===\n{{See|Market orientation}}\n\nThe marketing orientation is the most common orientation used in contemporary marketing. It is a customer-centric approach that involves a firm basing its marketing program around products that suit new consumer tastes. Firms adopting a marketing orientation typically engage in extensive market research to gauge consumer desires, use R&D (Research & Development) to develop a product attuned to the revealed information, and then utilize promotion techniques to ensure consumers are aware of the product's existence and the benefits it can deliver.<ref>McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., \"The Marketing Concept in Perspective,\" ''Business Horizons, May\u2013June, 1988, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Scales designed to measure a firm's overall market orientation have been developed and found to be robust in a variety of contexts.<ref>Hooley, G., Fahy, J., Beracs, J., Fonfara, K. and Snoj, B., \"Market Orientation in the Transition Economies of Central Europe: Tests of the Narver and Slater Market Orientation Scales,\" ''Journal of Business Research,'' Vol. 50, 2000, pp. 273\u201385. Note that the most widely applied scale is that developed by Narver and Slater in Narver, J.C., and Slater, S.F., ''The Effect of Marketing Orientation on Business Profitability,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vo. 54, 1990, pp. 20\u201335</ref>\n\nThe marketing orientation has three prime facets, which are:\n: ''Customer orientation'': A firm in the [[market economy]] can survive by producing [[goods]] that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining [[consumer demand]] is vital for a [[business entity|firm]]'s future viability and even existence as a [[going concern]].\n: ''Organizational orientation'': The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. \n:As an example, a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires.\n:The production department would then start to manufacture the product, while the marketing department would focus on the promotion, distribution, pricing, etc. of the product. Additionally, a firm's finance department would be consulted, with respect to securing appropriate funding for the development, production and promotion of the product. Finance may oppose the required capital expenditure, since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\n:'' Mutually beneficial exchange'': In a transaction in the market economy, a firm gains revenue, which thus leads to more profits, market shares, or sales. A consumer on the other hand gains the satisfaction of a need/want, utility, reliability and value for money from the purchase of a product or service.\n\n===Societal marketing===\n{{main|Societal marketing}}\n\nA number of scholars and practitioners have argued that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups such as employees, customers, and local communities.Companies that adopt a societal marketing perspective typically practice [[triple bottom line]] reporting whereby they publish social impact and environmental impact reports alongside financial performance reports. Sustainable marketing or [[green marketing]] is an extension of societal marketing.<ref>Blackwell Reference, [https://www.econbiz.de/Record/what-consumerism-means-for-marketers-kotler-philip/10002240532 Kotler, P., \"What consumerism means for marketers\"], ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp. 48\u201357; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought,\" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp. 224\u201332 {{doi|10.1177/0276146706291067}}; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the \"4 Eras\" of Thought Development,\" ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp. 116\u201346</ref>\n\n==The Marketing Mix==\n{{Main|Marketing mix}}\nThe marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools which marketers can use to bring their products or services to market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the [[marketing plan]] typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.\n\n===The 4Ps ===\n\nThe traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing.

The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. [[Brand]]ing, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, [[brand]], or company. <ref name=\":1\" />\n;[[Pricing]]:This refers to the process of setting a [[price]] for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product\u2014monetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of [[pricing science]]. <ref name=\":2\" />\n; Place (or [[distribution (business)|distribution]]):This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and [[retailer]]s who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called ''Place'' or ''Placement'', referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales. <ref name=\":2\" />\n;[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]:This includes all aspects of marketing communications; [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], including [[promotional education]], [[public relations]], [[sales|personal selling]], [[product placement]], [[branded entertainment]], event marketing, trade shows and [[exhibitions]]. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers.  The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.<ref name=\":2\">Borden, N., \"The Concept of the Marketing Mix,\" ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June 1964 pp. 2\u20137; van Waterschoot, W. and van den Bulte, C., \"The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, No. 4, 1992, pp. 83\u201393</ref>\n\n==== Criticisms ====\nOne of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis of an inside out-view. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Waves of Change|last=Gareth|first=Morgan|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1988|isbn=978-1555420932|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingwavesofcha00morg}}</ref> An ''inside-out'' approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of \"selling\" the organisation's products and messages to the \"outside\" or external stakeholders.<ref name=\":1\">Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., \"An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective,\" ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 2008, pp. 531\u201340</ref> In contrast, an ''outside-in'' approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.<ref>Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., \"How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works?

Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, \"communication\" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and \"promotion\" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either ''promotion'' or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = van Waterschoot | first1 = W. | last2 = van den Bulte | first2 = C. | year = | title = The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 83\u201393 | doi = 10.2307/1251988 }}</ref> Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.\n\nOther important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.<ref>Constantinides, E., \"The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vo. 22, 2006, pp. 407\u201338</ref>\n\n====Modifications and extensions====\n\nTo overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions have been found necessary for retail marketing, industrial marketing, and internet marketing\n\ninclude \"people\", \"process\", and \"physical evidence\" and are often applied in the case of [[services marketing]]<ref>Fisk, R.P., Brown, W., and Bitner, M.J., \"Tracking the Evolution of Services Marketing Literature, ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 41 (April), 1993; Booms, B. and Bitner, M.J. \"Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms\" in James H.

This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Cost'''\n\nCost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Convenience'''\n\nLike \"Place\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Communication'''\n\nLike \"Promotion\" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike, promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://catmediatheagency.com/4-ps-of-marketing-strategy/|title=Marketing Strategy: Forget the 4 P'S!

A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:\n* The macro-environment, over which a firm holds little control\n* The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control\n* The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://businessjargons.com/marketing-environment.html|title=What is Marketing Environment? definition and meaning \u2013 Business Jargons|date=2015-08-25|work=Business Jargons|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Macro===\n{{Main|Macromarketing}}\n\nA firm's marketing macro-environment consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include factors that are:\n\n* economic\n* social\n* political \n* technological \n\nA common method of assessing a firm's macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a [[PESTLE analysis]], a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, [[inflation]], [[unemployment]], etc.), [[Social Trends|social trends]]/attitudes, and the nature of technology's impact on its society and the business processes within the society. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Micro===\n\nA firm's micro-environment comprises factors pertinent to the firm itself, or stakeholders closely connected with the firm or company.\n\nA firm's micro-environment typically spans:\n* Customers/[[consumer]]s\n* [[Employees]]\n* [[Suppliers]]\n* The [[Media (communication)|Media]]\n\nIn contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Internal ===\nA firms internal environment consists of factors inside of the actual company. These are factors controlled by the firm and they affect the relationship that a firm has with its customers. These include factors such as:\n* Labor\n* Inventory\n* Company Policy\n* Logistics\n* Budget\n* Capital Assets <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n{{main|Marketing research}}\n\nMarketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between '''''marketing''''' research and '''''market''''' research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research.\n\nMarketing researchers use statistical methods (such as [[quantitative research]], [[qualitative research]], [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis tests]], [[Chi-squared test|Chi-square tests]], [[linear regression]], [[correlation coefficient]]s, [[frequency distribution]]s, [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] and [[binomial distribution]]s, etc.) to interpret their findings and convert data into information.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/4-principles-of-marketing-as-a-science-156082|title=4 Principles Of Marketing As A Science|date=2013-04-18|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe stages of research include:\n* Define the problem\n*Plan research\n*Research\n*Interpret data\n*Implement findings <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-marketing-spring2016/chapter/reading-the-marketing-research-process/|title=The Marketing Research Process {{!}} Principles of Marketing|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==Segmentation==\n{{main|Market segmentation}}\nMarket segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of marketing|last=Stanton|first=William J|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.\n\nMarket segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, and Position.\n\n'''Segmentation''' involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:\n* '''Geographic''' (such as a country, region, city, town)\n* '''Psychographic''' (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour)\n* '''Demographic''' (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education)\n*'''Gender'''\n*'''Income''' \n*'''Life-Cycle''' (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z)\n*'''Lifestyle''' (e.g. tech savvy, active)\n*'''Behavioural''' (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate) <ref>{{Cite book|title=Marketing: the Basics|last=Moore|first=Karl|last2=Pareek|first2=Niketh|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-77899-2|location=New York, NY|pages=38\u201365}}</ref>\n\nOnce a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The ''DAMP'' acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:\n* '''Discernable''' \u2013 how a segment can be differentiated from other segments.\n* '''Accessible''' \u2013 how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm\n* '''Measurable''' \u2013 can the segment be quantified and its size determined?\n* '''Profitable''' \u2013 can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment's servicing?\n\nThe next step in the targeting process is the level of [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:\n* '''Undifferentiated''' \u2013 where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment\n* '''Differentiated''' \u2013 in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment\n* '''[[Niche market|Niche]]''' \u2013 in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market\n\n''[[Positioning (marketing)|'''Positioning''']]'' concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management in Tourism|last=Moutinho|first=Luiz|publisher=CABI Publishing|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=121\u2013166}}</ref>\n\n==Promotional Mix==\n{{see also|Integrated marketing communications|3=Promotional mix}}\nThe promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media\n\n===Personal selling===\n{{main|Personal selling}}Personal selling involves an oral presentation given by a salesperson who approaches an individual or a group of potential customers. Personal selling allows for two-way communication and relationship building that can aid both the buyer and the seller in their goals. Personal selling is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing (e.g.: selling machinery to a factory, selling paper to a print shop), but it can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership). <ref name=\":0\" />[[File:ASC Leiden - W.E.A. van Beek Collection - Dogon markets 21 - Women selling their beer warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli, Mali 1989.jpg|thumb|Female beer sellers warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli market, Mali 1989]]\n===Sales promotion===\n{{Main|Sales promotion}}\nSales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include:\n\n* free samples\n* contests\n* premiums\n* trade shows\n* giveaways\n* coupons\n* sweepstakes\n* games\n\nDepending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Public relations===\n{{Main|Public relations}}\n[[Public relations]] is the use of media tools to promote a positive view of a company or product in the public's eye. Public relations monitors the public opinion of a company or product and generates publicity to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion.\n\nPublic relations can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Advertising===\n{{main|advertising}}\n[[Advertising]] occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel to publicize its product. Common examples of advertising include:\n\n* TV commercials\n* Radio commercials\n* Radio ads\n* Magazine ads\n* Online ads\n* Billboards\n* Event sponsorship\n* Direct mail ads\n* Transit ads <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social Media===\n{{main|Social media marketing}}\nSocial media is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Social media outlets such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Pinterest]], [[Snapchat]] and [[YouTube]] allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. Additionally, social media platforms can also house advertising and public relations content. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Lamb|first=Charles|last2=Hair|first2=Joseph|last3=McDaniel|first3=Carl|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2016|isbn=978-1-285-86014-5|location=Boston, MA}}</ref>. \n\n==The Marketing Plan==\n{{main|Marketing plan}}\nThe area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, as well as to an organization's overall marketing strategy. An organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Thus, when top management are devising the firm's strategic direction/mission, the intended marketing activities are incorporated into this plan.\n\n===Process===\n\nWithin the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus:\n* [[Mission statement|Mission Statement]]\n*[[SWOT analysis|SWOT]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis\n* Marketing Objectives\n* Targeted [[Marketing strategy|Marketing Strategy]]\n*Marketing Mix\n*Implementation <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Levels of marketing objectives within an organization===\n\nAs stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm.\n\nAt the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period.\n\nA '''[[strategic business unit]]''' (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy.\n\nThe '''functional''' level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims.\n\n==Product life cycle==\n\n{{See|Product life-cycle management (marketing)}}\n[[File:Product life cycle.png|thumb|[[Product lifecycle]]]]\nThe [[product lifecycle|product life cycle]] (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:\n* A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage\n* No product lasts perpetually on the market\n* A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC\n\nIn the '''introduction''' stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.\n\nDuring the '''growth''' stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.\n\nWhen the product hits '''maturity''', its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.\n\nDuring '''decline''', demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{main|Outline of marketing}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Account-based marketing]]\n* [[Advertising]]\n** [[History of advertising]]\n** [[Sex in Advertising]]\n* [[Advertising management]]\n* [[Affinity marketing]]\n* [[American business history]]\n* [[Brand awareness]]\n* [[Consumer confusion]]\n* [[Consumer behaviour]]\n* [[Database marketing]]\n* [[Demand chain]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Email remarketing]]\n* [[Family in advertising]]\n* [[History of marketing]]\n* [[List of marketing terms]]\n* [[Loyalty marketing]]\n* [[Macromarketing]]\n* [[Marketing management]]\n* [[Marketing mix]]\n* [[Marketing science]]\n* [[Marketing strategy]]\n* [[Micromarketing]]\n* [[Media manipulation]]\n* [[Multicultural marketing]]\n* [[Product management]]\n* [[Product marketing]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[Public Sector Marketing]]\n* [[Real-time marketing]]\n* [[Return on marketing investment]] (ROMI)\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Smarketing]]\n* [[Societal marketing]]\n* [[Sustainable market orientation]]\n* [[Visual marketing]]\n}}\n\n===<!-- This section is ONLY for recognised branches of marketing -->Types of marketing===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Agricultural marketing]]\n* [[Business marketing]] and [[industrial marketing]]\n* [[Destination marketing]]\n* [[Global marketing]]\n* [[Influencer marketing]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Services marketing]]\n* [[Social marketing]]\n}}\n\n===Marketing orientations or philosophies===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[History of marketing#The marketing orientation|Marketing orientation]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[History of marketing#Selling orientation|Selling orientation]]\n* [[Socially responsible marketing]] and [[corporate social responsibility]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]] and [[customer relationship management]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bartels, Robert, ''The History of Marketing Thought,\" Columbus, Ohio, Grid, (1976) 1988 [http://www.healthedpartners.org/ceu/hm/a02history_of_marketing_thought_by_bartels_hermans.pdf online]\n* {{cite book |last=Christensen |first=Clayton M. |authorlink=Clayton M.

Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies.\n\nExamples of products sold through B2B marketing include:\n\n* Major equipment\n* Accessory equipment\n* Raw materials\n* Component parts\n* Processed materials\n* Supplies\n* Business services<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:\n\n* Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)\n* Resellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\n* Governments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\n* Institutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use) <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== B2C marketing ===\nBusiness-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.\n\nTraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Business News Daily Editor, Exp |title=What is B2C? |url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5085-what-is-b2c.html |website=Business News Daily |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== C2B marketing ===\nConsumer-to-business marketing, or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposite to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers.\n\n=== C2C marketing ===\n[[Customer to customer]] marketing, or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction.

The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, amount of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n*Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product.

Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Orientations ==\n{{main|History of marketing#Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice}}\nA marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\"<ref name=\":5\">Mc Namara (1972) cited in Deshpande, R., ''Developing a Market Orientation,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 1999, p. 11</ref> or \"a corporate state of mind\"<ref>Kohli, A.K. and Jaworski, B.J., \"Market Orientation: The Construct, Research Propositions, and Managerial Implications,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 54, April 1990, pp. 1\u201318</ref> or as an \"organisation[al] culture\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Narver | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Slater | first2 = S.F. | year = | title = The Effect of a Market Orientation on Business Profitability | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 20\u201334 | doi = 10.2307/1251757 }}</ref> Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific orientations that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hollander | first1 = S.C. | last2 = Jones | first2 = D.G.B. | last3 = Dix | first3 = L. | year = | title = Periodization in Marketing History | url = | journal = Journal of Macromarketing | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 33\u201339 | doi = 10.1177/0276146705274982 }}</ref>\n\n===Product===\nA firm employing a product orientation is mainly concerned with the quality of its product. A product orientation is based on the assumption that all things being equal, consumers will purchase products of superior quality. The approach is most effective when the firm has deep insights into customer needs and desires as derived from research or intuition and understands consumer's quality expectations and price consumers are willing to pay. Although the product orientation has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, firms practicing a product orientation can still be found in haute couture and arts marketing.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1362/146934706776861573|title = Art for Art's Sake or Art for Business Sake: An exploration of artistic product orientation| journal=The Marketing Review| volume=6| pages=29\u201340|year = 2006|last1 = Fillis|first1 = Ian}}</ref><ref>Sheth, J., Sisodia, R.S. and Sharma, A., \"The Antecedents and Consequences of Customer-Centric Marketing,\" ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 28, No. 1, 2000, p. 55</ref>\n\n===Sales===\n{{See|History of marketing#Selling orientation}}\n\nA sales orientation focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants. This orientation seeks to attain the highest possible sales through promotion and direct sales techniques.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Kotler|first=Philip|publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc.|year=1980|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=}}</ref> The sales orientation \"is typically practiced with unsought goods.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 29</ref> One study found that industrial companies are more likely to hold a sales orientation than consumer goods companies.<ref>Avlonitis, G.J. and Gounaris, S.P., \"Marketing Orientation and Company Performance: Industrial vs. Consumer Goods Companies,\" ''Industrial Marketing Management,'' Vol. 26, 1997, pp. 385\u2013402</ref> The approach may also suit scenarios in which a firm holds dead stock, or otherwise sells a product that is in high demand, with little likelihood of changes in consumer tastes diminishing demand.\n\nA 2011 meta analyses<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s11747-010-0211-8|title = Drivers of sales performance: A contemporary meta-analysis.

A production orientation may be deployed when a high demand for a product or service exists, coupled with certainty that consumer tastes and preferences remain relatively constant (similar to the sales orientation). The so-called production era is thought to have dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28</ref> \n\n===Marketing===\n{{See|Market orientation}}\n\nThe marketing orientation is the most common orientation used in contemporary marketing. It is a customer-centric approach that involves a firm basing its marketing program around products that suit new consumer tastes. Firms adopting a marketing orientation typically engage in extensive market research to gauge consumer desires, use R&D (Research & Development) to develop a product attuned to the revealed information, and then utilize promotion techniques to ensure consumers are aware of the product's existence and the benefits it can deliver.<ref>McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., \"The Marketing Concept in Perspective,\" ''Business Horizons, May\u2013June, 1988, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Scales designed to measure a firm's overall market orientation have been developed and found to be robust in a variety of contexts.<ref>Hooley, G., Fahy, J., Beracs, J., Fonfara, K. and Snoj, B., \"Market Orientation in the Transition Economies of Central Europe: Tests of the Narver and Slater Market Orientation Scales,\" ''Journal of Business Research,'' Vol. 50, 2000, pp. 273\u201385. Note that the most widely applied scale is that developed by Narver and Slater in Narver, J.C., and Slater, S.F., ''The Effect of Marketing Orientation on Business Profitability,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vo. 54, 1990, pp. 20\u201335</ref>\n\nThe marketing orientation has three prime facets, which are:\n: ''Customer orientation'': A firm in the [[market economy]] can survive by producing [[goods]] that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining [[consumer demand]] is vital for a [[business entity|firm]]'s future viability and even existence as a [[going concern]].\n: ''Organizational orientation'': The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. \n:As an example, a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires.\n:The production department would then start to manufacture the product, while the marketing department would focus on the promotion, distribution, pricing, etc. of the product. Additionally, a firm's finance department would be consulted, with respect to securing appropriate funding for the development, production and promotion of the product. Finance may oppose the required capital expenditure, since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\n:'' Mutually beneficial exchange'': In a transaction in the market economy, a firm gains revenue, which thus leads to more profits, market shares, or sales. A consumer on the other hand gains the satisfaction of a need/want, utility, reliability and value for money from the purchase of a product or service.\n\n===Societal marketing===\n{{main|Societal marketing}}\n\nA number of scholars and practitioners have argued that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups such as employees, customers, and local communities.Companies that adopt a societal marketing perspective typically practice [[triple bottom line]] reporting whereby they publish social impact and environmental impact reports alongside financial performance reports. Sustainable marketing or [[green marketing]] is an extension of societal marketing.<ref>Blackwell Reference, [https://www.econbiz.de/Record/what-consumerism-means-for-marketers-kotler-philip/10002240532 Kotler, P., \"What consumerism means for marketers\"], ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp. 48\u201357; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought,\" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp. 224\u201332 {{doi|10.1177/0276146706291067}}; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the \"4 Eras\" of Thought Development,\" ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp. 116\u201346</ref>\n\n==The Marketing Mix==\n{{Main|Marketing mix}}\nThe marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools which marketers can use to bring their products or services to market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the [[marketing plan]] typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.\n\n===The 4Ps ===\n\nThe traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing. A Managerial Approach|year=1964|publisher=Irwin|location=Homewood, IL}}</ref><ref>Gr\u00f6nroos, Christian. \"From Marketing Mix to Relationship Marketing: Towards a Paradigm Shift in Marketing,\" ''Management Decision,'' vol. 32, no. 2, 1994, pp. 4\u201320.</ref>\n[[File:Marketing Mix 4P.svg|alt=The 4Ps of the marketing mix stand for product, price, place and promotion|thumb|278x278px|One version of the marketing mix is the 4Ps method.]]\n\n==== Outline ====\n\n;[[Product (business)|Product]]\n:The product aspects of marketing deal with the specifications of the actual goods or services, and how it relates to the [[end-user]]'s needs and wants. The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. [[Brand]]ing, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, [[brand]], or company. <ref name=\":1\" />\n;[[Pricing]]:This refers to the process of setting a [[price]] for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product\u2014monetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of [[pricing science]]. <ref name=\":2\" />\n; Place (or [[distribution (business)|distribution]]):This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and [[retailer]]s who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called ''Place'' or ''Placement'', referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales. <ref name=\":2\" />\n;[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]:This includes all aspects of marketing communications; [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], including [[promotional education]], [[public relations]], [[sales|personal selling]], [[product placement]], [[branded entertainment]], event marketing, trade shows and [[exhibitions]]. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers.  The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.<ref name=\":2\">Borden, N., \"The Concept of the Marketing Mix,\" ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June 1964 pp. 2\u20137; van Waterschoot, W. and van den Bulte, C., \"The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, No. 4, 1992, pp. 83\u201393</ref>\n\n==== Criticisms ====\nOne of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis of an inside out-view. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Waves of Change|last=Gareth|first=Morgan|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1988|isbn=978-1555420932|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingwavesofcha00morg}}</ref> An ''inside-out'' approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of \"selling\" the organisation's products and messages to the \"outside\" or external stakeholders.<ref name=\":1\">Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., \"An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective,\" ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 2008, pp. 531\u201340</ref> In contrast, an ''outside-in'' approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.<ref>Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., \"How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works?

Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, \"communication\" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and \"promotion\" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either ''promotion'' or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = van Waterschoot | first1 = W. | last2 = van den Bulte | first2 = C. | year = | title = The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 83\u201393 | doi = 10.2307/1251988 }}</ref> Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.\n\nOther important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.<ref>Constantinides, E., \"The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vo. 22, 2006, pp. 407\u201338</ref>\n\n====Modifications and extensions====\n\nTo overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions have been found necessary for retail marketing, industrial marketing, and internet marketing\n\ninclude \"people\", \"process\", and \"physical evidence\" and are often applied in the case of [[services marketing]]<ref>Fisk, R.P., Brown, W., and Bitner, M.J., \"Tracking the Evolution of Services Marketing Literature, ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 41 (April), 1993; Booms, B. and Bitner, M.J. \"Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms\" in James H.

This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Cost'''\n\nCost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Convenience'''\n\nLike \"Place\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Communication'''\n\nLike \"Promotion\" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike, promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://catmediatheagency.com/4-ps-of-marketing-strategy/|title=Marketing Strategy: Forget the 4 P'S!

A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:\n* The macro-environment, over which a firm holds little control\n* The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control\n* The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://businessjargons.com/marketing-environment.html|title=What is Marketing Environment? definition and meaning \u2013 Business Jargons|date=2015-08-25|work=Business Jargons|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Macro===\n{{Main|Macromarketing}}\n\nA firm's marketing macro-environment consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include factors that are:\n\n* economic\n* social\n* political \n* technological \n\nA common method of assessing a firm's macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a [[PESTLE analysis]], a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, [[inflation]], [[unemployment]], etc.), [[Social Trends|social trends]]/attitudes, and the nature of technology's impact on its society and the business processes within the society. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Micro===\n\nA firm's micro-environment comprises factors pertinent to the firm itself, or stakeholders closely connected with the firm or company.\n\nA firm's micro-environment typically spans:\n* Customers/[[consumer]]s\n* [[Employees]]\n* [[Suppliers]]\n* The [[Media (communication)|Media]]\n\nIn contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Internal ===\nA firms internal environment consists of factors inside of the actual company. These are factors controlled by the firm and they affect the relationship that a firm has with its customers. These include factors such as:\n* Labor\n* Inventory\n* Company Policy\n* Logistics\n* Budget\n* Capital Assets <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n{{main|Marketing research}}\n\nMarketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between '''''marketing''''' research and '''''market''''' research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research.\n\nMarketing researchers use statistical methods (such as [[quantitative research]], [[qualitative research]], [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis tests]], [[Chi-squared test|Chi-square tests]], [[linear regression]], [[correlation coefficient]]s, [[frequency distribution]]s, [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] and [[binomial distribution]]s, etc.) to interpret their findings and convert data into information.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/4-principles-of-marketing-as-a-science-156082|title=4 Principles Of Marketing As A Science|date=2013-04-18|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe stages of research include:\n* Define the problem\n*Plan research\n*Research\n*Interpret data\n*Implement findings <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-marketing-spring2016/chapter/reading-the-marketing-research-process/|title=The Marketing Research Process {{!}} Principles of Marketing|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==Segmentation==\n{{main|Market segmentation}}\nMarket segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of marketing|last=Stanton|first=William J|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.\n\nMarket segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, and Position.\n\n'''Segmentation''' involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:\n* '''Geographic''' (such as a country, region, city, town)\n* '''Psychographic''' (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour)\n* '''Demographic''' (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education)\n*'''Gender'''\n*'''Income''' \n*'''Life-Cycle''' (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z)\n*'''Lifestyle''' (e.g. tech savvy, active)\n*'''Behavioural''' (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate) <ref>{{Cite book|title=Marketing: the Basics|last=Moore|first=Karl|last2=Pareek|first2=Niketh|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-77899-2|location=New York, NY|pages=38\u201365}}</ref>\n\nOnce a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The ''DAMP'' acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:\n* '''Discernable''' \u2013 how a segment can be differentiated from other segments.\n* '''Accessible''' \u2013 how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm\n* '''Measurable''' \u2013 can the segment be quantified and its size determined?\n* '''Profitable''' \u2013 can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment's servicing?\n\nThe next step in the targeting process is the level of [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:\n* '''Undifferentiated''' \u2013 where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment\n* '''Differentiated''' \u2013 in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment\n* '''[[Niche market|Niche]]''' \u2013 in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market\n\n''[[Positioning (marketing)|'''Positioning''']]'' concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management in Tourism|last=Moutinho|first=Luiz|publisher=CABI Publishing|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=121\u2013166}}</ref>\n\n==Promotional Mix==\n{{see also|Integrated marketing communications|3=Promotional mix}}\nThe promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media\n\n===Personal selling===\n{{main|Personal selling}}Personal selling involves an oral presentation given by a salesperson who approaches an individual or a group of potential customers. Personal selling allows for two-way communication and relationship building that can aid both the buyer and the seller in their goals. Personal selling is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing (e.g.: selling machinery to a factory, selling paper to a print shop), but it can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership). <ref name=\":0\" />[[File:ASC Leiden - W.E.A. van Beek Collection - Dogon markets 21 - Women selling their beer warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli, Mali 1989.jpg|thumb|Female beer sellers warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli market, Mali 1989]]\n===Sales promotion===\n{{Main|Sales promotion}}\nSales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include:\n\n* free samples\n* contests\n* premiums\n* trade shows\n* giveaways\n* coupons\n* sweepstakes\n* games\n\nDepending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Public relations===\n{{Main|Public relations}}\n[[Public relations]] is the use of media tools to promote a positive view of a company or product in the public's eye. Public relations monitors the public opinion of a company or product and generates publicity to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion.\n\nPublic relations can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Advertising===\n{{main|advertising}}\n[[Advertising]] occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel to publicize its product. Common examples of advertising include:\n\n* TV commercials\n* Radio commercials\n* Radio ads\n* Magazine ads\n* Online ads\n* Billboards\n* Event sponsorship\n* Direct mail ads\n* Transit ads <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social Media===\n{{main|Social media marketing}}\nSocial media is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Social media outlets such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Pinterest]], [[Snapchat]] and [[YouTube]] allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. Additionally, social media platforms can also house advertising and public relations content. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Lamb|first=Charles|last2=Hair|first2=Joseph|last3=McDaniel|first3=Carl|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2016|isbn=978-1-285-86014-5|location=Boston, MA}}</ref>. \n\n==The Marketing Plan==\n{{main|Marketing plan}}\nThe area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, as well as to an organization's overall marketing strategy. An organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Thus, when top management are devising the firm's strategic direction/mission, the intended marketing activities are incorporated into this plan.\n\n===Process===\n\nWithin the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus:\n* [[Mission statement|Mission Statement]]\n*[[SWOT analysis|SWOT]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis\n* Marketing Objectives\n* Targeted [[Marketing strategy|Marketing Strategy]]\n*Marketing Mix\n*Implementation <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Levels of marketing objectives within an organization===\n\nAs stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm.\n\nAt the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period.\n\nA '''[[strategic business unit]]''' (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy.\n\nThe '''functional''' level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims.\n\n==Product life cycle==\n\n{{See|Product life-cycle management (marketing)}}\n[[File:Product life cycle.png|thumb|[[Product lifecycle]]]]\nThe [[product lifecycle|product life cycle]] (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:\n* A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage\n* No product lasts perpetually on the market\n* A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC\n\nIn the '''introduction''' stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.\n\nDuring the '''growth''' stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.\n\nWhen the product hits '''maturity''', its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.\n\nDuring '''decline''', demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{main|Outline of marketing}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Account-based marketing]]\n* [[Advertising]]\n** [[History of advertising]]\n** [[Sex in Advertising]]\n* [[Advertising management]]\n* [[Affinity marketing]]\n* [[American business history]]\n* [[Brand awareness]]\n* [[Consumer confusion]]\n* [[Consumer behaviour]]\n* [[Database marketing]]\n* [[Demand chain]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Email remarketing]]\n* [[Family in advertising]]\n* [[History of marketing]]\n* [[List of marketing terms]]\n* [[Loyalty marketing]]\n* [[Macromarketing]]\n* [[Marketing management]]\n* [[Marketing mix]]\n* [[Marketing science]]\n* [[Marketing strategy]]\n* [[Micromarketing]]\n* [[Media manipulation]]\n* [[Multicultural marketing]]\n* [[Product management]]\n* [[Product marketing]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[Public Sector Marketing]]\n* [[Real-time marketing]]\n* [[Return on marketing investment]] (ROMI)\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Smarketing]]\n* [[Societal marketing]]\n* [[Sustainable market orientation]]\n* [[Visual marketing]]\n}}\n\n===<!-- This section is ONLY for recognised branches of marketing -->Types of marketing===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Agricultural marketing]]\n* [[Business marketing]] and [[industrial marketing]]\n* [[Destination marketing]]\n* [[Global marketing]]\n* [[Influencer marketing]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Services marketing]]\n* [[Social marketing]]\n}}\n\n===Marketing orientations or philosophies===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[History of marketing#The marketing orientation|Marketing orientation]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[History of marketing#Selling orientation|Selling orientation]]\n* [[Socially responsible marketing]] and [[corporate social responsibility]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]] and [[customer relationship management]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bartels, Robert, ''The History of Marketing Thought,\" Columbus, Ohio, Grid, (1976) 1988 [http://www.healthedpartners.org/ceu/hm/a02history_of_marketing_thought_by_bartels_hermans.pdf online]\n* {{cite book |last=Christensen |first=Clayton M. |authorlink=Clayton M.

These positions are employed by all organized/unorganized [[basketball]] teams. They are defined as the [[point guard]] (PG), the [[shooting guard]]\n(SG), the [[small forward]] (SF), the [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] (PF), and the [[center (basketball)|center]] (C).\n\nThe point guard is the ''de facto'' leader of the team on the court. This position requires substantial ball-handling skills and the ability to facilitate the team during a play. The shooting guard, as the name implies, is often the best shooter, as well as being capable of shooting accurately from longer distances. The small forward often has an aggressive approach to the basket when handling the ball. The small forward is also known to make cuts to the basket in efforts to get open for shots. The power forward and the center make up the frontcourt, often acting as their team's primary rebounders or shot blockers, or receiving passes to take inside shots. The center is typically the larger of the two.\n\n== Overview ==\nHistorically, only three positions were recognized (two guards, two forwards, and one center) based on where they played on the court: Guards generally played outside and away from the hoop and forwards played inside and near the baseline, with the center usually positioned in the key. During the 1980s, the team strategy evolved after the three-point shot was added to the game. More specialized roles developed, resulting in the five position designations used today. However, individual team strategy and availability of personnel can alter the positions used by a particular team. For example, the [[dribble drive motion|dribble-drive motion]] offense and the [[Princeton offense]] use four interchangeable guards and one center. This set is also known as a \"four-in and one-out\" play scheme. Other combinations are also prevalent.\n\nBesides the five basic positions, some teams use non-standard or hybrid positions, such as the [[point forward]], a hybrid small forward/point guard; the [[swingman]], a hybrid small forward/shooting guard; the [[Forward-center|big]], a hybrid power forward/center; and the [[stretch four]], a power forward with the shooting range of typical shooting guards.\n\nIn the early days of the sport, there was a \"running guard\" who brought the ball up the court and passed or attacked the basket, like a point or [[combo guard]]. There was also a \"stationary guard\" who made long shots and hung back on defense before there was the rule of backcourt violations.<ref name=\"Peterson2002\">{{cite book|author=Robert Peterson|title=Cages to Jump Shots: Pro Basketball's Early Years|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgM54Dp2vuoC&pg=PA84|year=2002|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|isbn=0-8032-8772-0|pages=84\u2013}}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|G}} Guard ==\n=== {{anchor|PG}} Point guard ===\n{{Main|Point guard}}\n\nThe '''point guard''' ('''PG'''), <ref>^ a b Rose, Lee H. (2016). The Basketball Handbook. Point guards pass the ball on offence and then head down the floor to set up and start the play. On defense, they guard the other point guard or one of the wings. Once they receive the ball they sprint towards the basket if it is open. If not open they stand back and wait till all of their team's layers are down the floor and pass the ball. If open for a shot they will shoot to score a few points depending on where they standing. Human Kinetics.</ref> known as the '''one''', is typically the team's best ball handler and passer. They usually are very fast and are good at driving and short-range. Therefore, they often lead their team in assists and are able to create shots for themselves and their teammates. They are quick and are able to hit shots either outside the key but a majority are inside the 3 point line or layups, largely depending on the player's skill level. Point guards are looked upon as the \"floor general\" or the \"coach on the floor\". They should study the game and game film to be able to recognize the weaknesses of the defense, and the strengths of their own offense. They are responsible for directing plays, making the position equivalent to that of [[quarterback]] in [[American football]], [[playmaker]] in [[Association football|association football (soccer)]], [[center (ice hockey)|center]] in [[ice hockey]], or setter in [[volleyball]]. Good point guards increase team efficiency and generally have a high number of [[Assist (basketball)|assists]]. They are often referred to as [[dribble]]rs or play-makers. In the [[NBA]], point guards are usually the shortest players on the team and are mostly between {{height|ft=5|in=9.7|abbr=mos}} and {{height|ft=6|in=4.25|abbr=mos}}.\n\n=== {{anchor|SG}} Shooting guard ===\n{{Main|Shooting guard}}\n\nThe '''shooting guard (SG)''' is also known as the '''two''' or the '''off guard'''. Along with the small forward, a shooting guard is often referred to as a wing because of its use in common positioning tactics. As the name suggests, most shooting guards are prolific from the three-point range and long mid range. Some key aspects to being a shooting guard is having the ability to patiently and methodically circulate the three point line linear with that of the ball. This allows the ability to correctly get in open space for other positions handling the ball. \"I tell basketball players I work with that they aren't open if they can't receive the ball. That means that just because you don't have someone within 10 feet of you doesn't mean you're open. In order to be open, learn to make yourself available to the basketball. That doesn't mean you have to be close to the basketball, but rather you have to have space to move into in order to receive the basketball.\" (who says this?)<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usab.com:443/youth/news/2011/06/the-ultimate-guide-to-playing-small-forward.aspx|title=The Ultimate Guide to Playing Small Forward|website=www.usab.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218014546/https://www.usab.com/youth/news/2011/06/the-ultimate-guide-to-playing-small-forward.aspx|archive-date=2020-02-18|url-status=live}}</ref>Just like all positions in basketball, the ability to communicate efficiently with teammates is key. If a players teammates do not know where/when a player will be open, they won't be able to deliver the ball when an efficient opportunity presents itself. \"When you go into grab a quick meal at McDonalds you don't have the cashier guess what your order is do you? No, of course not! You tell them what you want. As a shooting guard you have to be the same way.\"<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nBesides being able to shoot the ball, shooting guards tend to be the best defender on the team, as well as being able to move without the ball to create open looks for themselves. Some shooting guards also have good ball handling skills, often creating their own shots off the dribble. A versatile shooting guard will have good passing skills, allowing them to assume point guard responsibilities known as combo guards. Bigger shooting guards also tend to play as small forwards. In the NBA, shooting guards usually range from 6 feet 0.75 inches (1.85 m) to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m).\n\n== {{anchor|F}} Forward ==\n=== {{anchor|SF}} Small forward===\n{{Main|Small forward}}\n\nThe '''small forward (SF)''', also known as the '''three''', is considered to be the most versatile of the main five basketball positions. \"Though they're not the primary ball handler, small forwards need dribbling skills. Though they're not expected to be great post players, they need to be able to post up. Though they're often not the top scoring option, they need to be able to score.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usab.com:443/youth/news/2011/06/7habits-of-successful-shooting-guards.aspx|title=7 Habits of Successful Shooting Guards|website=www.usab.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218030919/https://www.usab.com/youth/news/2011/06/7habits-of-successful-shooting-guards.aspx|archive-date=2020-02-18|url-status=live}}</ref>Versatility is key for small forwards because of the nature of their role, which resembles that of a shooting guard more often than that of a power forward. This is why the small forward and shooting guard positions are often interchangeable and referred to as wings.\n\nSmall forwards have a variety of assets, such as quickness and strength inside. One common thread among all kinds of small forwards is an ability to \"get to the line\" and draw fouls by aggressively attempting (post-up) plays, lay-ups, or slam dunks. As such, accurate foul shooting is a common skill for small forwards, many of whom record a large portion of their points from the foul line. Besides being able to drive to the basket, they are also good shooters from long range. They are the second-best 3 point shooters on the court along with the shooting guard and usually when stationary, sit just inside the 3 point line. Some small forwards have good passing skills, allowing them to assume point guard responsibilities as point forwards. Small forwards should be able to do a little bit of everything on the court, typically playing roles such as swing men and defensive specialists. A smaller small forward under 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) might play the shooting guard position some of the time and a bigger small forward above the height of 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) might play power forward sometimes. In the NBA, small forwards usually range from 6 feet 3.5 inches (1.92 m) to 6 feet 8.25 inches (2.04 m).\n\n=== {{anchor|PF}} Power forward===\n{{Main|Power forward (basketball)}}\n\nThe '''power forward''' ('''PF'''), also known as the '''four''', often plays a role similar to that of the [[center (basketball)|center]], down in the \"post\" or \"low blocks.\" The power forward is often the team's most powerful and dependent scorer, being able to score close to the basket while also being able to shoot mid-range jump shots from 10 - 15 feet from the basket. Some power forwards have become known as [[stretch four]]s, since extending their shooting range to [[Three-point field goal|three-pointers]]. On defense, they are required to have the strength to guard bigger players close to the basket and to have the athleticism to guard quick players away from the basket. Most power forwards tend to be more versatile than centers since they can be part of plays and are not always in the low block. A tall power forward above {{height|ft=6|in=10|abbr=mos}} can be a Forward-Center, playing PF and C. A smaller power forward {{height|ft=6|in=7|abbr=mos}} can play combo forward, playing SF part-time. In the [[NBA]], power forwards usually range from {{height|ft=6|in=5.5|abbr=mos}} to {{height|ft=6|in=10.25|abbr=mos}} without shoes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fansided.com/pf-height-2016/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219021619/https://fansided.com/pf-height-2016/ |archive-date=2019-02-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|C}} Center==\n{{Main|Center (basketball)}}\n\nThe '''center''' ('''C'''), also known as the '''five''', usually plays near the baseline or close to the basket (the \"low post\"). They are usually the tallest players on the floor. The center usually scores \"down low,\" or \"in the paint\" (near the basket, in the key), but some can be good perimeter shooters. They are typically skilled at gathering rebounds, contesting shots and setting [[Screen (sports)|screens]] on players.\n\nThe center position has been traditionally considered one of the most important positions, if not the most important. The range of players used in the position has transitioned from relatively slower but much taller \"back to the basket\" players to players who would normally be classified as power forwards but can dominate the position with their defensive skills, or mismatch ability to shoot from the high post. This has been due to the scarcity of players possessing the combination of great skill, ideal height, and durability. This has been matched by the development of more fast-paced and athletic basketball play, which calls for less traditional center play and a more up-and-down the court play style. They are usually above {{height|ft=6|in=10|abbr=mos}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Starting lineup#Basketball|Starting lineup]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n== External links ==\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/bsp/hi/basketball/rules/players/html/default.stm \"Basketball players\" at BBC Sport Academy]\n\n{{Basketball}}\n{{Basketball Positions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Basketball Position}}\n[[Category:Basketball positions| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Positions played in basketball}}\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2016}}\n[[File:Basketball Positions.png|right|thumb|upright=1.6|Basketball positions with the numbers as they are known:<br/>{{hlist|1\u2013Point guard|2\u2013Shooting guard|3\u2013Small forward|4\u2013Power forward|5\u2013Center}}]]\nThere are five positions in basketball.

In the NBA, shooting guards usually range from 6 feet 0.75 inches (1.85 m) to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m).\n\n== {{anchor|F}} Forward ==\n=== {{anchor|SF}} Small forward===\n{{Main|Small forward}}\n\nThe '''small forward (SF)''', also known as the '''three''', is considered to be the most versatile of the main five basketball positions. \"Though they're not the primary ball handler, small forwards need dribbling skills. Though they're not expected to be great post players, they need to be able to post up. Though they're often not the top scoring option, they need to be able to score.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usab.com:443/youth/news/2011/06/7habits-of-successful-shooting-guards.aspx|title=7 Habits of Successful Shooting Guards|website=www.usab.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218030919/https://www.usab.com/youth/news/2011/06/7habits-of-successful-shooting-guards.aspx|archive-date=2020-02-18|url-status=live}}</ref>Versatility is key for small forwards because of the nature of their role, which resembles that of a shooting guard more often than that of a power forward. This is why the small forward and shooting guard positions are often interchangeable and referred to as wings.\n\nSmall forwards have a variety of assets, such as quickness and strength inside. One common thread among all kinds of small forwards is an ability to \"get to the line\" and draw fouls by aggressively attempting (post-up) plays, lay-ups, or slam dunks. As such, accurate foul shooting is a common skill for small forwards, many of whom record a large portion of their points from the foul line. Besides being able to drive to the basket, they are also good shooters from long range. They are the second-best 3 point shooters on the court along with the shooting guard and usually when stationary, sit just inside the 3 point line. Some small forwards have good passing skills, allowing them to assume point guard responsibilities as point forwards. Small forwards should be able to do a little bit of everything on the court, typically playing roles such as swing men and defensive specialists. A smaller small forward under 6 feet 5 inches (1.96 m) might play the shooting guard position some of the time and a bigger small forward above the height of 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m) might play power forward sometimes. In the NBA, small forwards usually range from 6 feet 3.5 inches (1.92 m) to 6 feet 8.25 inches (2.04 m).\n\n=== {{anchor|PF}} Power forward===\n{{Main|Power forward (basketball)}}\n\nThe '''power forward''' ('''PF'''), also known as the '''four''', often plays a role similar to that of the [[center (basketball)|center]], down in the \"post\" or \"low blocks.\" The power forward is often the team's most powerful and dependent scorer, being able to score close to the basket while also being able to shoot mid-range jump shots from 10 - 15 feet from the basket. Some power forwards have become known as [[stretch four]]s, since extending their shooting range to [[Three-point field goal|three-pointers]]. On defense, they are required to have the strength to guard bigger players close to the basket and to have the athleticism to guard quick players away from the basket. Most power forwards tend to be more versatile than centers since they can be part of plays and are not always in the low block. A tall power forward above {{height|ft=6|in=10|abbr=mos}} can be a Forward-Center, playing PF and C. A smaller power forward {{height|ft=6|in=7|abbr=mos}} can play combo forward, playing SF part-time. In the [[NBA]], power forwards usually range from {{height|ft=6|in=5.5|abbr=mos}} to {{height|ft=6|in=10.25|abbr=mos}} without shoes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fansided.com/pf-height-2016/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-02-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219021619/https://fansided.com/pf-height-2016/ |archive-date=2019-02-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n== {{anchor|C}} Center==\n{{Main|Center (basketball)}}\n\nThe '''center''' ('''C'''), also known as the '''five''', usually plays near the baseline or close to the basket (the \"low post\"). They are usually the tallest players on the floor. The center usually scores \"down low,\" or \"in the paint\" (near the basket, in the key), but some can be good perimeter shooters. They are typically skilled at gathering rebounds, contesting shots and setting [[Screen (sports)|screens]] on players.\n\nThe center position has been traditionally considered one of the most important positions, if not the most important. The range of players used in the position has transitioned from relatively slower but much taller \"back to the basket\" players to players who would normally be classified as power forwards but can dominate the position with their defensive skills, or mismatch ability to shoot from the high post. This has been due to the scarcity of players possessing the combination of great skill, ideal height, and durability. This has been matched by the development of more fast-paced and athletic basketball play, which calls for less traditional center play and a more up-and-down the court play style. They are usually above {{height|ft=6|in=10|abbr=mos}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Starting lineup#Basketball|Starting lineup]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n== External links ==\n* [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/bsp/hi/basketball/rules/players/html/default.stm \"Basketball players\" at BBC Sport Academy]\n\n{{Basketball}}\n{{Basketball Positions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Basketball Position}}\n[[Category:Basketball positions| ]]\n", "name_user": "Apparition11", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:c/e", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_positions"}

The first few episodes portray the demise of Sadhana's mother due to her illness, and Sadhana's father being incapable of saving her due to him having an insufficient amount of money. Sadhana's father vows to travel to the [[United States of America]] to accumulate more money and endows the young Sadhana to her maternal uncle Prakash Chandra ([[Alok Nath]]). The show then takes a 17-year leap with Sadhana living in [[Agra]] and her father in [[California]]. Sadhana's father's only dream is to see her in the form of a bride. On the contrary, Sadhana longs to see her father. Living in the Sharma household, she manages to win both Ragini's and Prakash Chandra's hearts over, however Ragini's mother, Kaushalya ([[Vibha Chibber]]) is hesitant due to the difference of skin complexion between the two. One day, the news comes that Sadhana's father is returning from [[California]] and will take Sadhana back to [[Udaipur]]. Everyone rejoices. However, a turn of fate destroys all hope. Unfortunately, due to the violent weather, Sadhana's father's plane crashes and he dies. Sadhana is heartbroken to hear the news. She eventually ends up staying at the Sharma house.\n\nStruggles for finding a suitable match for Ragini are on, owing to her dark complexion, and she ends up getting rejected in favour of the lighter-complexioned Sadhana. However, one proposal gets finalized, and Kaushalya and Nanima decide to hide Sadhana. However, due to unforeseeable circumstances, Sadhana reaches the wedding venue of Ragini, and the boy's family reject Ragini in favour of Sadhana once again, which causes Kaushalya to attempt suicide, but Prakashchand saves her. Things eventually start getting back to normal, and Sadhana gets a new job.\n\nSadhana starts working at the Rajvansh house as a tutor. Ranveer ([[Kinshuk Mahajan]]) is one of the sons of the house who went to the [[United States of America]] to study abroad and eventually comes back. He has a brother Alekh ([[Angad Hasija]]) who is mentally unstable. Alekh's mother, Vasundhara ([[Seema Kapoor]]) thinks that marriage can help Alekh to get better. The Sharmas suffer from major financial problems and are threatened to lose their house. Vasundhara offers Sadhana money to save their home in exchange for Sadhana and Alekh's marriage, but Sadhana also puts forth the additional demand of getting Ranveer married to Ragini, because she witnesses Ranveer protecting Ragini's honour from a few hooligans after they tease her dark complexion and comes to the conclusion that he would make a good life partner for Ragini, and she for him. Vasundhara tricks Sadhana by accepting her demand, but it is only a facade. She sends off Ranveer to the U.S., while Sadhana marries Alekh, but promises to get them married once he returns. Sadhana marries Alekh, but the marriage of Ragini with Ranveer does not happen as Ranvir falls in love with Sonia while in the U.S., and brings her along with him to India. However, it is later revealed that Sonia is a gold-digger who only attached herself to Ranveer for his money. After this revelation, Ranveer is heartbroken and begins to sink into depression. However, as a twist of fate, it is Ragini who ends up saving him from this fate when she dials his number by mistake, and in beautiful words, advises him to move on in life. Ranveer is massively enthralled by her words, and slowly, Ranveer and Ragini begin talking on the phone regularly, unaware of the other's identity. They refer to themselves as Anmol and Anamika. Sadhana eventually figures this out, but does not reveal it to them and leaves the fate of their friendship to God. She, however, lets Alekh in on this secret.\n\nRanveer and Ragini begin to fall in love, and decide to meet each other. However, when they meet, both are shocked, and due to the interference of Vasundhara (who doesn't want to accept Ragini as her daughter-in-law due to her dark complexion), Ranveer thinks that Ragini knew about his identity all along, but chose to play with his feelings in order to marry into a rich family. Ragini, meanwhile, is shocked to learn that Ranveer is Anmol, and is heartbroken when he seemingly rejects her. Ranveer and Ragini, both get to know that Sadhana knew about their real identities all along and blame her for hiding it from them. However, misunderstandings eventually get cleared up after Ranveer realises that he truly loves Ragini when he learns that very much like him, she too had no idea of his real identity and had truly loved him all along. He decides that his life is not complete without her and fights tooth and nail to win her love after leaving her heartbroken. Slowly but surely, their love wins over their families, especially their opposing mothers, and they eventually marry. After their marriage, they decide to help Sadhana in order to cure Alekh so that she can experience a fulfilling marital life as well. They are successful in their quest. Misunderstandings develop between Sadhana and Alekh after his recovery, however, they also get cleared up eventually, and they all live happily together for a while. Ragini and Sadhana soon become pregnant and the whole family are overjoyed. However, nine months later, tragedy strikes as Sadhana dies in a fire, whilst saving Ragini but her unborn baby is saved. The whole family are devastated of Sadhana\u2019s death. Ragini thus decides to raise Sadhana\u2019s daughter up too along with hers.   \n\nThe show then takes a seven-year leap where Ragini is shown bringing her daughter Tamanna up along with Khushi who is Sadhana's  daughter. Ragini and the family commemorate the seventh anniversary of Sadhana's death. It is revealed that Ranveer died, too, in a rock avalanche while saving his friend Anmol ([[Apurva Agnihotri]])'s life. Anmol promised Ranvir to look after his family and as a result, he lives in the Rajvansh household as Tamanna's father. After Sadhana and Ranveer's deaths, Alekh has lost his mental balance once again but eventually recovers thanks to the care of a girl named Sakshi ([[Sulagna Panigrahi]]) who comes close to him. The show ends with a two-hour special episode in which Ragini remarries to Anmol and Alekh to Sakshi. Guests come to congratulate them and dance. Both couples take deceased Sadhana and Ranveer's blessings and perform the Bidaai (farewell) ritual.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main cast===\n*[[Parul Chauhan]] as Ragini Ranvir Rajvansh Sareen (2007-2010)\n*[[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara Khan]] as Sadhana Alekh Rajvansh<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/tv/news/hindi/Generation-leap-as-Sadhana-passes-away/articleshow/6085329.cms|title=Generation leap as Sadhana passes away|website=Times of India}}</ref> (2007-2010)\n*[[Angad Hasija]] as Alekh Inderjit Rajvansh, Sadhana\u2019s ex-husband: Sakshi\u2019s husband and Khushi\u2019s father (2008-2010)\n*[[Kinshuk Mahajan]] as Ranveer Inderjit Rajvansh, Ragini's first husband, Alekh\u2019s brother and Tamanna\u2019s father (2008-2010)\n*[[Sulagna Panigrahi]] as Sakshi Alekh Rajvansh, Alekh's second wife (2010)\n*[[Apurva Agnihotri]] as Anmol Sareen, Ragini's second husband (2010)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/apurva-agnihotri-in-bidaai/637076/|title=Apurva Agnihotri in Bidaai|website=Indian Express}}</ref>\n\n===Recurring cast===\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*Nirali Desai as Tamanna Ranvir Rajvansh (Ragini and Ranveer\u2019s daughter) (2010) \n*Divya Naaz as Khushi Alekh Rajvansh (Sadhna and Alekh's daughter) (2010) \n*[[Alok Nath]] as Prakash Chandra Sharma, Sadhna's uncle, Ragini's father (2007-2010)\n*[[Vibha Chibber]] as Kaushalya Prakash Chandra Sharma, Sadhna's aunt, Ragini's mother (2007-2010)\n*[[Ashita Dhawan]] as Malti Vineet Sharma, Ragini's sister-in-law, Vineet's wife (2007-2010) Seslendirme: Burcu G\u00fcne\u015ftutar\n*[[Naveen Saini]] as Vineet Prakash Chandra Sharma, Sadhna's cousin brother, Ragini's brother (2007-2010)\n*Siddharth Kumar as Kavya Vineet Sharma, Malti and Vineet's son (2010)\n*[[Amardeep Jha]] as Sumitra Naani (2007-2010)\n*[[Mahesh Thakur]] as Kishanchand Awasthy, Sadhna's father (2007)\n*[[Seema Kapoor]] as Vasundhara Inderjit Rajvansh, Ranveer and Alekh's mother (2008-2010) Seslendirme: Birtanem Candaner\n*[[Avinash Wadhawan]] as Inderjit Rajvansh, Ranveer and Alekh's father (2008-2010) Seslendirme: Bora Se\u00e7kin\n*Natasha Rana as Ambika Satyen Rajvansh, Satyen's wife (2008-2009)\n*Aliraza Namdar as Satyen Rajvansh (2008-2009)\n*Vimarsh Roshan as Naveen Satyen Rajvansh (2008-2010)\n*[[Preeti Puri]] as Avni Naveen Rajvansh (2008-2010)\n*Rahul Lohani as Karan Inderjit Rajvansh (2010)\n*[[Shafaq Naaz]] as Guni Rajvansh (2008-2010)\n*Shabana Mullani as Dolly Rajvansh (2008-2010)\n*[[Prerna Wanvari]] as Shivani (2010)\n*Puneet Tejwani as Dr. Shlok (2009)\n*Aruna Singhal as Shakuntala (2009)\n*[[Manish Raisinghan]] as Saket (2007)\n*[[Madhura Naik]] as Sonia Singh/ Sonia Chopra (2008)\n*[[Eva Grover]] as Sheetal (2008)\n*[[Amar Upadhyay]] as Advocate Dhananjay Singhania (2009)\n*[[Utkarsha Naik]] as Sulakshana (2007) \n*[[Kamalika Guha Thakurta]] as Vidyashree Shasthry (2010)\n*Shambhavi Sharma as Gujri (2007-2010)\n*Rajshri Thakur as Nishtha Vasudev (2009)\n*Pragati Mehra as Sadhna's aunt, Kamlesh's wife (2007)\n*[[Rajendra Chawla]] as Kamlesh Awasthy, Sadhna's uncle, Kishanchand's brother (2007)\n*[[Sadiya Siddiqui]] as Ragini's dance teacher (2007)\n*Smriti Sinha as Maillika Mehra (2010)\n*Amit Singh Thakur as Mr. Mehra (2010)\n*Seerat Alam as Isha (2010)\n*Puneet Sachdev as Tarun (2010)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Guests===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Neha Bamb]] as herself from ''[[Maayka]]''\n*[[Dalljiet Kaur]] as herself from ''[[Santaan]]''\n*[[Additi Gupta]] as Heer from ''[[Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil]]''\n*[[Harshad Chopra]] as Prem from ''[[Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil]]''\n*[[Puja Banerjee]] as Vrinda from ''[[Tujh Sang Preet Lagai Sajna (2008 TV series)|Tujh Sang Preet Lagai Sajna]]''\n*[[Drashti Dhami]] as Geet from ''[[Geet \u2013 Hui Sabse Parayi]]''\n*[[Karan Tacker]] as Shantanu from ''[[Rang Badalti Odhani]]''\n*[[Hina Khan]] as Akshara from ''[[Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai]]''\n*[[Karan Mehra]] as Naitik from ''[[Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai]]''\n*[[Ragini Khanna]] as Suhana from ''[[Sasural Genda Phool]]''\n*[[Jay Soni]] as Ishaan from ''[[Sasural Genda Phool]]''\n*[[Pooja Gor|Pooja Gaur]] as Pratigya from ''[[Mann Kee Awaaz Pratigya]]''\n*[[Rajesh Khattar]] as Bittu  \n*[[Manasi Parekh Gohil]] as Gulaal to promote the show ''Gulaal''\n*[[Vishal Singh (actor, born 1974) | Vishal Singh]] as Rajveer (Episode 19)\n*[[Rucha Gujarathi]] as Sonia (Episode 19)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nSpeaking about his role, male lead [[Angad Hasija]] said, \"My character Alekh was a [[Schizophrenia|Schizophrenic]].

The first few episodes portray the demise of Sadhana's mother due to her illness, and Sadhana's father being incapable of saving her due to him having an insufficient amount of money. Sadhana's father vows to travel to the [[United States of America]] to accumulate more money and endows the young Sadhana to her maternal uncle Prakash Chandra ([[Alok Nath]]). The show then takes a 17-year leap with Sadhana living in [[Agra]] and her father in [[California]]. Sadhana's father's only dream is to see her in the form of a bride. On the contrary, Sadhana longs to see her father. Living in the Sharma household, she manages to win both Ragini's and Prakash Chandra's hearts over, however Ragini's mother, Kaushalya ([[Vibha Chibber]]) is hesitant due to the difference of skin complexion between the two. One day, the news comes that Sadhana's father is returning from [[California]] and will take Sadhana back to [[Udaipur]]. Everyone rejoices. However, a turn of fate destroys all hope. Unfortunately, due to the violent weather, Sadhana's father's plane crashes and he dies. Sadhana is heartbroken to hear the news. She eventually ends up staying at the Sharma house.\n\nStruggles for finding a suitable match for Ragini are on, owing to her dark complexion, and she ends up getting rejected in favour of the lighter-complexioned Sadhana. However, one proposal gets finalized, and Kaushalya and Nanima decide to hide Sadhana. However, due to unforeseeable circumstances, Sadhana reaches the wedding venue of Ragini, and the boy's family reject Ragini in favour of Sadhana once again, which causes Kaushalya to attempt suicide, but Prakashchand saves her. Things eventually start getting back to normal, and Sadhana gets a new job.\n\nSadhana starts working at the Rajvansh house as a tutor. Ranveer ([[Kinshuk Mahajan]]) is one of the sons of the house who went to the [[United States of America]] to study abroad and eventually comes back. He has a brother Alekh ([[Angad Hasija]]) who is mentally unstable. Alekh's mother, Vasundhara ([[Seema Kapoor]]) thinks that marriage can help Alekh to get better. The Sharmas suffer from major financial problems and are threatened to lose their house. Vasundhara offers Sadhana money to save their home in exchange for Sadhana and Alekh's marriage, but Sadhana also puts forth the additional demand of getting Ranveer married to Ragini, because she witnesses Ranveer protecting Ragini's honour from a few hooligans after they tease her dark complexion and comes to the conclusion that he would make a good life partner for Ragini, and she for him. Vasundhara tricks Sadhana by accepting her demand, but it is only a facade. She sends off Ranveer to the U.S., while Sadhana gets married to Alekh, but promises to get them married once he returns. Sadhana marries Alekh, but the marriage of Ragini with Ranveer does not happen as Ranvir falls in love with Sonia while in the U.S., and brings her along with him to India. However, it is later revealed that Sonia is a gold-digger who only attached herself to Ranveer for his money. After this revelation, Ranveer is heartbroken and begins to sink into depression. However, as a twist of fate, it is Ragini who ends up saving him from this fate when she dials his number by mistake, and in beautiful words, advises him to move on in life. Ranveer is massively enthralled by her words, and slowly, Ranveer and Ragini begin talking on the phone regularly, unaware of the other's identity. They refer to themselves as Anmol and Anamika. Sadhana eventually figures this out, but does not reveal it to them and leaves the fate of their friendship to God. She, however, lets Alekh in on this secret.\n\nRanveer and Ragini begin to fall in love, and decide to meet each other. However, when they meet, both are shocked, and due to the interference of Vasundhara (who doesn't want to accept Ragini as her daughter-in-law due to her dark complexion), Ranveer thinks that Ragini knew about his identity all along, but chose to play with his feelings in order to marry into a rich family. Ragini, meanwhile, is shocked to learn that Ranveer is Anmol, and is heartbroken when he seemingly rejects her. Ranveer and Ragini, both get to know that Sadhana knew about their real identities all along and blame her for hiding it from them. However, misunderstandings eventually get cleared up after Ranveer realises that he truly loves Ragini when he learns that very much like him, she too had no idea of his real identity and had truly loved him all along. He decides that his life is not complete without her and fights tooth and nail to win her love after leaving her heartbroken. Slowly but surely, their love wins over their families, especially their opposing mothers, and they eventually marry. After their marriage, they decide to help Sadhana in order to cure Alekh so that she can experience a fulfilling marital life as well. They are successful in their quest. Misunderstandings develop between Sadhana and Alekh after his recovery, however, they also get cleared up eventually, and they all live happily together for a while. Ragini and Sadhana soon become pregnant and the whole family are overjoyed. However, nine months later, tragedy strikes as Sadhana dies in a fire, whilst saving Ragini but her unborn baby is saved. The whole family are devastated of Sadhana\u2019s death. Ragini thus decides to raise Sadhana\u2019s daughter up too along with hers.   \n\nThe show then takes a seven-year leap where Ragini is shown bringing her daughter Tamanna up along with Khushi who is Sadhana's  daughter. Ragini and the family commemorate the seventh anniversary of Sadhana's death. It is revealed that Ranveer died, too, in a rock avalanche while saving his friend Anmol ([[Apurva Agnihotri]])'s life. Anmol promised Ranvir to look after his family and as a result, he lives in the Rajvansh household as Tamanna's father. After Sadhana and Ranveer's deaths, Alekh has lost his mental balance once again but eventually recovers thanks to the care of a girl named Sakshi ([[Sulagna Panigrahi]]) who comes close to him. The show ends with a two-hour special episode in which Ragini remarries to Anmol and Alekh to Sakshi. Guests come to congratulate them and dance. Both couples take deceased Sadhana and Ranveer's blessings and perform the Bidaai (farewell) ritual.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main cast===\n*[[Parul Chauhan]] as Ragini Ranvir Rajvansh Sareen (2007-2010)\n*[[Sara Khan (TV actress)|Sara Khan]] as Sadhana Alekh Rajvansh<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://m.timesofindia.com/tv/news/hindi/Generation-leap-as-Sadhana-passes-away/articleshow/6085329.cms|title=Generation leap as Sadhana passes away|website=Times of India}}</ref> (2007-2010)\n*[[Angad Hasija]] as Alekh Inderjit Rajvansh, Sadhana\u2019s ex-husband: Sakshi\u2019s husband and Khushi\u2019s father (2008-2010)\n*[[Kinshuk Mahajan]] as Ranveer Inderjit Rajvansh, Ragini's first husband, Alekh\u2019s brother and Tamanna\u2019s father (2008-2010)\n*[[Sulagna Panigrahi]] as Sakshi Alekh Rajvansh, Alekh's second wife (2010)\n*[[Apurva Agnihotri]] as Anmol Sareen, Ragini's second husband (2010)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/apurva-agnihotri-in-bidaai/637076/|title=Apurva Agnihotri in Bidaai|website=Indian Express}}</ref>\n\n===Recurring cast===\n{{Div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*Nirali Desai as Tamanna Ranvir Rajvansh (Ragini and Ranveer\u2019s daughter) (2010) \n*Divya Naaz as Khushi Alekh Rajvansh (Sadhna and Alekh's daughter) (2010) \n*[[Alok Nath]] as Prakash Chandra Sharma, Sadhna's uncle, Ragini's father (2007-2010)\n*[[Vibha Chibber]] as Kaushalya Prakash Chandra Sharma, Sadhna's aunt, Ragini's mother (2007-2010)\n*[[Ashita Dhawan]] as Malti Vineet Sharma, Ragini's sister in law, Vineet's wife (2007-2010) Seslendirme: Burcu G\u00fcne\u015ftutar\n*[[Naveen Saini]] as Vineet Prakash Chandra Sharma, Sadhna's cousin brother, Ragini's brother (2007-2010)\n*Siddharth Kumar as Kavya Vineet Sharma, Malti and Vineet's son (2010)\n*[[Amardeep Jha]] as Sumitra Naani (2007-2010)\n*[[Mahesh Thakur]] as Kishanchand Awasthy, Sadhna's father (2007)\n*[[Seema Kapoor]] as Vasundhara Inderjit Rajvansh, Ranveer and Alekh's mother (2008-2010) Seslendirme: Birtanem Candaner\n*[[Avinash Wadhawan]] as Inderjit Rajvansh, Ranveer and Alekh's father (2008-2010) Seslendirme: Bora Se\u00e7kin\n*Natasha Rana as Ambika Satyen Rajvansh, Satyen's wife (2008-2009)\n*Aliraza Namdar as Satyen Rajvansh (2008-2009)\n*Vimarsh Roshan as Naveen Satyen Rajvansh (2008-2010)\n*[[Preeti Puri]] as Avni Naveen Rajvansh (2008-2010)\n*Rahul Lohani as Karan Inderjit Rajvansh (2010)\n*[[Shafaq Naaz]] as Guni Rajvansh (2008-2010)\n*Shabana Mullani as Dolly Rajvansh (2008-2010)\n*[[Prerna Wanvari]] as Shivani (2010)\n*Puneet Tejwani as Dr. Shlok (2009)\n*Aruna Singhal as Shakuntala (2009)\n*[[Manish Raisinghan]] as Saket (2007)\n*[[Madhura Naik]] as Sonia Singh/ Sonia Chopra (2008)\n*[[Eva Grover]] as Sheetal (2008)\n*[[Amar Upadhyay]] as Advocate Dhananjay Singhania (2009)\n*[[Utkarsha Naik]] as Sulakshana (2007) \n*[[Kamalika Guha Thakurta]] as Vidyashree Shasthry (2010)\n*Shambhavi Sharma as Gujri (2007-2010)\n*Rajshri Thakur as Nishtha Vasudev (2009)\n*Pragati Mehra as Sadhna's aunt, Kamlesh's wife (2007)\n*[[Rajendra Chawla]] as Kamlesh Awasthy, Sadhna's uncle, Kishanchand's brother (2007)\n*[[Sadiya Siddiqui]] as Ragini's dance teacher (2007)\n*Smriti Sinha as Maillika Mehra (2010)\n*Amit Singh Thakur as Mr. Mehra (2010)\n*Seerat Alam as Isha (2010)\n*Puneet Sachdev as Tarun (2010)\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Guests===\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Neha Bamb]] as herself from ''[[Maayka]]''\n*[[Dalljiet Kaur]] as herself from ''[[Santaan]]''\n*[[Additi Gupta]] as Heer from ''[[Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil]]''\n*[[Harshad Chopra]] as Prem from ''[[Kis Desh Mein Hai Meraa Dil]]''\n*[[Puja Banerjee]] as Vrinda from ''[[Tujh Sang Preet Lagai Sajna (2008 TV series)|Tujh Sang Preet Lagai Sajna]]''\n*[[Drashti Dhami]] as Geet from ''[[Geet \u2013 Hui Sabse Parayi]]''\n*[[Karan Tacker]] as Shantanu from ''[[Rang Badalti Odhani]]''\n*[[Hina Khan]] as Akshara from ''[[Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai]]''\n*[[Karan Mehra]] as Naitik from ''[[Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai]]''\n*[[Ragini Khanna]] as Suhana from ''[[Sasural Genda Phool]]''\n*[[Jay Soni]] as Ishaan from ''[[Sasural Genda Phool]]''\n*[[Pooja Gor|Pooja Gaur]] as Pratigya from ''[[Mann Kee Awaaz Pratigya]]''\n*[[Rajesh Khattar]] as Bittu  \n*[[Manasi Parekh Gohil]] as Gulaal to promote the show ''Gulaal''\n*[[Vishal Singh (actor,  born 1974) | Vishal Singh]] as Rajveer (Episode 19)\n*[[Rucha Gujarathi]] as Sonia (Episode 19)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nSpeaking about his role, male lead [[Angad Hasija]] said, \"My character Alekh was a [[Schizophrenia|Schizophrenic]].

It is served by [[Sydney Trains]] [[Bankstown Line|T3 Bankstown line]] services. It was designed and built by NSW Government Railways from 1895 to 1937. It is also known as '''Belmore Railway Station Group''' and '''Burwood Road'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]].<ref name=NSWEnvironment&Heritage/> It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1081>{{cite NSW SHR|5045375|Belmore Railway Station Group|hr=01081|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBelmore station opened on 1 February 1895 when the opened from [[Sydenham railway station, Sydney|Sydenham]]. It served as the terminus of the line until it was extended to [[Bankstown railway station|Bankstown]] on 14 April 1909.\n\nBelmore is located on the [[Sydenham, New South Wales|Sydenham]] to [[Bankstown railway line|Bankstown line]] and was opened as the initial terminus station on 1 February 1895. Its initial construction name was Burwood Road but it was named Belmore on opening. There is no evidence that the station was to be named St. George as suggested in some sources. However it was not unusual for a number of names to be publicly canvassed in the lead-up to opening of a station and this was probably the case in this instance. The locality and station were named after the Earl of Belmore, [[Governor of New South Wales]] between 1868 and 1872.<ref name=nswshr-1081/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Belmore |title=Belmore Station |work=NSWrail.net |date= |access-date= }}</ref><ref name=NSWEnvironment&Heritage>{{Cite NSW HD|4801084|Belmore Railway Station Group|date=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe station was built when Belmore was still rural. The station layout featured a typical brick station building on an island platform. A station master's residence was also built in 1895 and is still extant at 346 Burwood Road, opposite the station, but is now in private ownership.<ref name=nswshr-1081/>\n\nThe line had its origins in Railway Commissioner Goodchap's 1882 recommendation that an additional line was needed between [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] and [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] to relieve traffic on the Southern Line and to encourage agriculture and suburban settlement. Lobbying by local interests and land speculators achieved Parliamentary approval by 1890 and construction commenced in 1892. The most important stations on the line, Belmore, [[Canterbury, New South Wales|Canterbury]] and [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]], were built with impressive near-identical brick buildings, the other intermediate stations ([[Campsie, New South Wales|Campsie]], [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales|Dulwich Hill]] and [[Hurlstone Park, New South Wales|Hurlstone Park]]) receiving more modest timber buildings (later replaced), possibly reflecting economies of the depression of the 1890s.<ref name=nswshr-1081/>\n\nThe depression suppressed the profitability of the line and the extension to Liverpool did not proceed. However, suburban development followed in the early twentieth century, particularly during the interwar period when many War Service homes were built west of Canterbury.

It is served by [[Sydney Trains]] [[Bankstown Line|T3 Bankstown line]] services. It was designed and built by NSW Government Railways from 1895 to 1937. It is also known as '''Belmore Railway Station Group''' and '''Burwood Road'''. The property is owned by [[RailCorp]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]].<ref name=NSWEnvironment&Heritage/> It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.<ref name=nswshr-1081>{{cite NSW SHR|5045375|Belmore Railway Station Group|hr=01081|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nBelmore station opened on 1 February 1895 when the opened from [[Sydenham railway station, Sydney|Sydenham]]. It served as the terminus of the line until it was extended to [[Bankstown railway station|Bankstown]] on 14 April 1909.\n\nBelmore is located on the [[Sydenham, New South Wales|Sydenham]] to [[Bankstown railway line|Bankstown line]] and was opened as the initial terminus station on 1 February 1895. Its initial construction name was Burwood Road but it was named Belmore on opening. There is no evidence that the station was to be named St. George as suggested in some sources. However it was not unusual for a number of names to be publicly canvassed in the lead-up to opening of a station and this was probably the case in this instance. The locality and station were named after the Earl of Belmore, [[Governor of New South Wales]] between 1868 and 1872.<ref name=nswshr-1081/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nswrail.net/locations/show.php?name=NSW:Belmore |title=Belmore Station |work=NSWrail.net |date= |access-date= }}</ref><ref name=NSWEnvironment&Heritage>{{Cite NSW HD|4801084|Belmore Railway Station Group|date=|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe station was built when Belmore was still rural. The station layout featured a typical brick station building on an island platform. A station master's residence was also built in 1895 and is still extant at 346 Burwood Road, opposite the station, but is now in private ownership.<ref name=nswshr-1081/>\n\nThe line had its origins in Railway Commissioner Goodchap's 1882 recommendation that an additional line was needed between [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] and [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]] to relieve traffic on the Southern Line and to encourage agriculture and suburban settlement. Lobbying by local interests and land speculators achieved Parliamentary approval by 1890 and construction commenced in 1892. The most important stations on the line, Belmore, [[Canterbury, New South Wales|Canterbury]] and [[Marrickville, New South Wales|Marrickville]], were built with impressive near-identical brick buildings, the other intermediate stations ([[Campsie, New South Wales|Campsie]], [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales|Dulwich Hill]] and [[Hurlstone Park, New South Wales|Hurlstone Park]]) receiving more modest timber buildings (later replaced), possibly reflecting economies of the depression of the 1890s.<ref name=nswshr-1081/>\n\nThe depression suppressed the profitability of the line and the extension to Liverpool did not proceed.
