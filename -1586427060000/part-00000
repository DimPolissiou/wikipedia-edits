Dale Hall, Director of the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS), signed a recommendation to abandon jaguar recovery as a federal goal under the Endangered Species Act.

It is focused on protecting the jaguars living near the border between the United States and Mexico. The core of the project is the [[Northern Jaguar Reserve]]. The project began in 2003 with the purchase of the 10,000 acre Los Pavos Ranch in northern Mexico, just {{convert|125|mile|km|abbr=on}} south of the border. In 2008 it was expanded to more than double its size when Rancho Zetasora was acquired. Both ranches are remote, difficult to access, and relatively untouched, making them perfect habitat, not just for jaguars, but for many other species as well. The Northern Jaguar Project is the \"northernmost location where jaguars, [[North American cougar|mountain lion]]s, [[bobcat]]s, and [[ocelot]]s are all found in the same vicinity\", and the park also features a variety of floral habitats as well.<ref name=\"NJP\">{{cite web |title=The Northern Jaguar Project |url=http://www.northernjaguarproject.org/ |access-date=2012-03-16}}</ref><ref name=\"NJP SOC\">{{cite web |work=Northern Jaguar Project |title=Species of Concern |url=http://www.northernjaguarproject.org/northern-jaguar-reserve/threats-and-opportunities/species-of-concern |access-date=2012-03-16}}</ref>\n\nThe project is also focused on efforts to create a stable jaguar population in Northwestern Mexico. However, its long term aspirations include a return of the jaguar to the [[Southwestern United States]]. The potential for such a re-introduction is deemed high, since as much as 30% of Arizona alone is considered to be a suitable habitat for the jaguar.<ref name=\"JWM2005\"/>\n\n== Threats ==\n[[San Bernardino National Wildlife Refuge]] is close to the proposed border barrier, and since the proposed project would cut through a migration corridor for the jaguar between Mexico and the USA, it may interfere with the migration of Mexican jaguars to the USA, not withstanding other animals.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/29/trump-border-wall-water-fish-species-threatened|title=Water-guzzling demands of Trump's border wall threaten fish species|last=Lakhani|first=Nina|date=2019-12-29|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-12-29|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biologicaldiversity.org/w/news/press-releases/trump-bulldozes-new-wall-through-wildlife-refuge-jaguar-country-2019-10-31/|title=Trump Bulldozes New Wall Through Wildlife Refuge, Jaguar Country|website=Center for Biological Diversity|language=en|access-date=2019-11-02}}</ref>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nJaguar (Panthera onca) negra.jpg|Photograph of a [[black panther|melanistic jaguar]] in the Museum of La Venta, [[Villahermosa]], [[Tabasco]], southern [[Mexico]]\nJunior-Jaguar-Belize-Zoo.jpg|A three-year-old [[captive animal|captive]] jaguar kept at the [[Belize Zoo]], west of [[Belize City]]\nBlack Jaguar (Panthera onca) (6766731069).jpg|A [[melanistic]] jaguar at Belize Zoo\nPanthera onca.
