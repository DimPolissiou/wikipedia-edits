It is located  {{convert|25|km|mi|0}} northeast of [[Edmonton]], Alberta's capital city, along the [[North Saskatchewan River]]. Fort Saskatchewan is part of the [[Edmonton Capital Region#Edmonton CMA|Edmonton census metropolitan area]] and is one of 24 municipalities that constitute the [[Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board]] (EMRB).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_organization/metropolitan-region-board.aspx|title=Edmonton Metropolitan Region Board|last=Edmonton|first=City of|date=2020-03-30|website=www.edmonton.ca|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> Fort Saskatchewan's population in the 2016 federal census was 24,149. Its population has since increased to 26,942 according to the city's 2019 municipal census.\n\nThe city was founded as a [[North-West Mounted Police]] (N.W.M.P.) fort, and was later home to a large provincial [[Prison|gaol]]; the city prides itself on its \"law and order\" history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.travelalberta.com/ca/listings/fort-heritage-precinct-4214/|title=Fort Heritage Precinct {{!}} Alberta Canada|website=www.travelalberta.com|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> The original fort was located across the river from the hamlet of [[Lamoureux, Alberta|Lamoureux]], and in recent years the city has constructed a replica fort next to the original site. Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Nutrien]] (formerly [[Agrium]]), and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\n[[File:Original Fort Saskatchewan NWMP Post west gate.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Markers indicate the original fort's West entrance, with the replica fort visible in the background.

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced. It is the only surviving model 100-19 railway station in Alberta.  \n\nThe first bridge across the river was also built at this time; the rail company paying for it in exchange for free land for its station in Fort Saskatchewan.<ref name=\"peterream2\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=339}}</ref>  Prior to the bridge, the only method to cross the river at Fort Saskatchewan was via ferry.<ref name=\"peterream2\" /> In the decade after the railway arrived, the town's population nearly doubled to 993.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=557}}</ref>\nIn 1913, a fire swept through a large portion of the city's business section, destroying $24,000 worth of buildings (roughly $550,000 in 2020).<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:CN Caboose Fort Saskatchewan.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|300x300px|CN Caboose #79242 at the Fort Saskatchewan Station]]\n=== The Provincial Gaol ===\nA new $200,000 provincial gaol (roughly $4.5 million in 2020) opened in 1915 on the site of the old fort to replace the 34-cell guard house that had been used to hold prisoners since the N.W.M.P. fort was constructed in 1875.<ref name=\"peterream3\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |pages=420\u2013425}}</ref> The fort was demolished to make room for the prison.

By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed 300 male and female offenders. \n\n==== Riot ====\nOn January 19th, 1955, 24 hours after the chief guard and two other guards were dismissed, 96 inmates rioted in the prison dining room, led by 12 ringleaders who barricaded themselves in the prison's bakery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/crime/day-in-history-jan-19-1955-tear-gas-used-to-quell-riot-at-fort-jail|title=Day in History, Jan. 19, 1955: Tear gas used to quell riot at Fort jail|website=Edmonton Journal|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> Dishes and furniture were thrown about and smashed, and a store room in the bakery was destroyed by fire after the ring leaders torched clothing, boots, and other supplies that they found. Prisoners in a cell block believed to contain rioters shouted phrases such as \"Get the story straight\" to nearby reporters. They claimed that they rioted because of the food at the gaol. The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street.

The fire was doused by the local fire department, and the riot was put down by 50 [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police|R.C.M.P.]] officers from Edmonton, who were armed with tear gas and smoke grenades. After the ring leaders were pulled from the Bakery, they were returned to their cells. The prison has previously seen an inmate sit-down in October 1950, and a small disturbance in March 1949, but this was the most significant act of aggression by inmates that the prison had seen to date. The riot caused $10,000 worth of damage (approximately $97,000 in 2020).\n==== Replacement ====\n[[File:Fort Saskatchewan Warden's House.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Warden's House in the Fort Heritage Precinct |alt=]]The jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre, which houses 546 inmates, was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves. This was meant to provide convenient access to the prison for the Warden while normalizing life for the Warden's wife and children; recognizing his duel role as Warden, and as father/husband.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.davidmurrayarchitect.ca/fort-saskatchewan-historic-buildings/|title=Fort Saskatchewan Historic Buildings|date=2016-03-02|website=David Murray Architect|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Expansion and development ===\nIn 1952, [[Sherritt Gordon Mines]] started construction on a $25-million nickel refinery in Fort Saskatchewan, which started production in 1954.<ref name=\"peterream4\">{{cite book |title= The Fort on the Saskatchewan |last=Ream |first=Peter |year=1974 |publisher=Metropolitan Printing |page=459}}</ref> Following Sherritt Gordon's locating in Fort Saskatchewan, more industries constructed plants in the town.

Radhakrishnan previously had been advancing a harmonizing viewpoint with regard to the study of [[comparative religions]], and the academic Chair had a subtext of being \"founded to propagate a kind of universalism\". Zaehner's inaugural lecture was unconventional in content. He delivered a strong yet witty criticism of \"universalism\" in religion.<ref>Zaehner's 1953 Spalding lecture, \"Foolishness to the Greeks\", was incorporated as an Appendix, pp. 428\u2013443, in his book ''Concordant Discord'' (1970).</ref>\n\nIt drew controversy.

Based on mystical writings, he offered an innovative typology that became widely discussed in academic journals. He also analyzed claims that [[mescalin]] use fit into this spiritual quest. His conclusion was near dismissive. Yet he revisited his harsh words on the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of drug mysticism in his 1972 book ''Zen, Drug and Mysticism''. His warnings became somewhat qualified by some prudent suggestions. He carefully distinguished between drug-induced states and religious mysticism. Then the [[BBC]] began asking him to talk on the radio, where he acquired a following.

Zaehner traveled twice to the [[University of St. Andrews]] during the years 1967 to 1969. The subject he choose concerned the convoluted and intertwined history of the different world religions during the long duration of their mutual co-existence. He described the interactions as both fiercely contested and relatively cross-cultivating, in contrast to other periods of a more sovereign isolation. The lectures were later published in 1970 \"just four years before his death\" by Oxford University as ''Concordant Discord.

He acted not out of an ill will, but from a conviction that any fruitful dialogue between religions must be based on a \"pursuit of truth\". If such profound dialogue rested on a false or a superficial \"harmony and friendship\" it would only foster hidden misunderstandings, Zaehner thought, which would ultimately result in a deepening mistrust.<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970), pp. 6 & 7 (quotes).</ref><ref>[[Gregory Baum]], \"Foreword\" to Newell (1981), p. xi.</ref>\n\n==His writings==\n\n===Zoroastrian studies===\n\n====''Zurvan''====\nInitially Zaehner's reputation rested on his studies of [[Zoroastrianism]], at first articles mostly on [[philology]] in academic journals. He labored for many years on a scholarly work, his ''[[Zurvan]], a Zoroastrian dilemma'' (1955). This book provides an original discussions of an influential [[theology|theological]] deviation from the Zoroastrian orthodoxy of ancient Persia's [[Achaemenid Empire]], which was a stark, ethical [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]. Zurvanism was promoted by the [[Sasanian Empire]] (224\u2013651) which arose later during Roman times. Until the Muslim conquest, Zurvanism in the Persian world became established and disestablished by turns.<ref>Zaehner, ''Zurvan'' (1955, 1972). The oldest reference for Zurvan found dates to the 12th (name), and 4th (sources unclear) centuries BCE (p. 20). Zurvanism had been installed at start of Sasanid rule as its state religion (p. 90), yet its status varied (pp. 112\u2013113).</ref><ref>Touraj Daryaee, ''Sasanian Iran 224\u2013651 CE'' (Mazda Publishers, Costa Mesa 2008), King [[Ardashir I|Ardaxsir I]] founded Sananid rule as Zoroastrian, with labors by the priest Kerdir (p, 16); Zurvan in edict (p. 62).</ref><ref>Zaehner differs with [[Mary Boyce]] as to whether, during the prior [[Parthia]]n period (247 BCE to 224 CE) in Iran, Zoroastrianism survived if not flourished, or was little practiced, confused and inauthentic. Zaehner chose the latter (the Sasanians \"restored the Zoroastrian faith\"). Compare: her ''Zoroastrians. Their Religious Beliefs and Practices'' (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul 1979, 1985), pp. 80\u201382; and, his ''Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism'' (1961), pp. at 22 (quote), 175.</ref>\n\nZurvan was an innovation analogous to Zoroastrian original doctrine. The prophet [[Zoroaster]] preached that the benevolent ''[[Ahura Mazda]]'' (the \"Wise Lord\"), as the creator God, fashioned both ''[[Spenta Mainyu]]'' (the Holy Spirit), and ''[[Angra Mainyu]]'' (the Aggressive Spirit) who chose to turn evil. These two created Spirits were called twins, one good, one evil. Over the centuries ''Ahura Mazda'' and his \"messenger\" the good ''Spenta Mainyu'' became conflated and identified; hence, the creator ''Ahura Mazda'' began to be seen as the twin of the evil ''Angra Mainyu''. It was in this guise that Zoroastrianism became the state religion in Achaemenid Persia. Without fully abandoning dualism, some started to consider ''Zurvan'' (Time) as the underlying cause of both the benevolent ''Ahura Mazda'' and the evil ''Angra Mainyu''. The picture is complicated by very different schools of Zurvanism, and contesting Zoroastrian sects. Also, ''Ahura Mazda'' was later known as ''[[Ohrmazd]]'', and ''Angra Mainyu'' became ''[[Ahriman]]''.<ref>Zaehner, ''Zurvan'' (1955, 1972), pp. 3\u20135 (dualism of Zoroaster, and development of Zurvan).</ref><ref>Zaehner, ''Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism'' (1961) at 34, 42\u201346 (Zoroaster's teaching); 178\u2013183 , 246\u2013247 (Zoroastrian sects).</ref><ref>Mary Boyce, ''Zoroastrians.

With Time as 'father' twins came into being: the ethical, bountiful ''Ohrmazd'', who was worshipped, and his satanic antagonist ''Ahriman'', against whom believers fought. As Infinite Time, Zurvan rose supreme \"above Ohrmazd and Ahriman\" and stood \"above good and evil\". This aggravated the traditional 'orthodox' Zoroastrians (the Mazdean ethical dualists).<ref>Zaehner, ''Zurvan. A Zoroastrian dilemma'' (1955, 1972): Zurvan supreme (pp. 90, 91 quote).</ref><ref>Farhang Mehr, ''The Zoroastrian Tradition'' (Element, Rockport 1991), moral dualism (pp. 71\u201376).</ref> Zoroastrian cosmology understood that \"finite Time comes into existence out of Infinite Time\". During the 12,000 year period of finite Time (Zurvan being both kinds of Time), human history occurs, the fight against Ahriman starts, and the final victory of ''Ohrmazd'' is achieved. Yet throughout, orthodox Mazdeans insisted, it is Ohrmazd who remains supreme, not Zurvan. On the other hand, his adherents held that Zurvan was God of Time, Space, Wisdom, and Power, and the Lord of Death, of Order, and of Fate.<ref>Zaehner, ''Zurvan'' (1955, 1972), finite Time, victory of Ohrmazd (pp. 106\u2013107 quote, and 100\u2013101); Zurvan as God (p. 219), as Lord (pp. 239, 248, 254).</ref>\n\n====''Teachings of the Magi''====\n''The Teachings of the Magi'' (1956)<ref>A short (156 pages) book published by George Allen and Unwin for a series, Classics East and West.</ref> was Zaehner's second of three book on Zoroastrianism. It presented the \"main tenets\" of the religion in the Sasanid era, during the reign of [[Shapur II]], a 4th-century King. Its chief sources were [[Pahlavi literature|Pahlavi books]] written a few centuries later by Zoroastrians. Each of its ten chapters contains Zaehner's descriptive commentaries, illustrated by his translations from historic texts. Chapter IV, \"The Necessity of Dualism\" is typical, half being the author's narrative and half extracts from a Pahlavi work, here the [[Shikand-gumanic Vichar|Shikand Gumani Vazar]] by Mardan Farrukh.<ref>Zaehner (1956), Chapter IV, pp. 52\u201366. The \"main tenants\" quote at p. 11.</ref>\n\n====''Dawn and Twilight''====\nIn his ''The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism'' (1961), Zaehner adopted a chronological dichotomy.  He first explores origins, the founding of the religion by its prophet Zoroaster. He notes that the [[Gathas]], the earliest texts in the [[Avesta]], make it obvious that \"Zoroaster met with very stiff opposition from the civil and ecclesiastical authorities when once he had proclaimed his mission.\" \"His enemies... supported the ancient national religion.\" On moral and ecological grounds, Zoroaster favored the \"settled [[pastoral]] and agricultural community\" as against the \"predatory, marauding tribal societies\". His theological and ethical dualism advocated for \"the followers of Truth the life-conserving and life-enhancing forces\" and against the \"destructive forces\" of the Lie.<ref>Zaehner, ''Dawn and Twilight'' (1961), p. 25 (''Gathas''); p. 35 (quote \"opposition\"), p. 37 (quote \"enemies\"); p. 40 (quotes \"settled\", \"marauding\"); p. 42 (quote \"Truth\" and \"Lie\").</ref> For the dates of the prophet's life, Zaehner adopted the traditional 6th century BCE dates.<ref>Zaehner, ''Dawn and Twilight'' (1961), p. 33 (dates [of Sasanian priests] were pegged to year of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s conquests).</ref><ref>Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin, ''La religion de l'Iran ancient'' (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France 1962) translated as ''Religion of Ancient Iran'' (Bombay: Tata 1973), pp. 99\u2013100. Classic Greeks assigned his dates to 6000 years before Plato. The \"native tradition\" of the 7th century CE placed him 258 years before Alexander (early 6th century BC). The author here concludes 600 BC at the latest (concurrent with Buddha and Confucius), but perhaps 1000 BC per \"linguistic evidence\".</ref><ref>Josef Wieseh\u00f6fer, ''Ancient Persia'' (London: I. B. Tauris 1996), pp. 96, 272. Now \"very few scholars\" dissent to prophet's date of circa \"1000 BC\".</ref><ref>Boyce, ''A History of Zoroastrianism'', volume 1 (Leiden/K\u00f6ln: E. J. Brill 1975) at 190. Boyce notes that the 6th-century dates were suggested by Sasanian priests, but are known to be artificial. She favors an earlier dating, 1400 to 1000 BC, for the prophet Zarathushtra or Zoroaster. His ''Gathas'' are linguistically comparable to the [[Rig Veda]], dated at 1700 BC, and the pastoral social economy described in the ''Gathas'' fits that time period.</ref><ref>Mehr, ''The Zoroastrian Tradition'' (1991), pp. 3\u20135. Mehr's discussion gives a date of 1750 BC for Zoroaster, stating reasons similar to those of Boyce.</ref>\n\n[[Zoroaster]] reformed the old [[polytheistic]] religion by making Ahura Mazdah [the Wise Lord] the Creator, the only God. An innovation by Zoroaster was the ''abstract notions'', namely, the Holy Spirit, and the [[Amesha Spentas]] (Good Mind, Truth, Devotion, Dominion, Wholeness, Immortality). Zaehner interpreted them '''not''' as new substitutes for the excluded old gods, \"but as part of the divine personality itself\" which may also serve \"as mediating functions between God and man\". The ''Amesha Spentas'' are \"aspects of God, but aspects in which man too can share.\"<ref>Zaehner, ''Dawn and Twilight'' (1961), pp. 54-55 (Ahura Mazdah); 45-46 (\"mediating\" quote), 71 (\"aspects\" quote).</ref> Angra Mainyu was the dualistic evil.<ref>See above: ''Zurvan'' section.</ref> Dating to [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|before the final parting]] of ways of the [[Indo-Iranians]], the [[Hindu]]s had two classes of gods, the ''[[asura]]s'' (e.g., [[Varuna]]) and the ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]'' (e.g., [[Indra]]). Later following the invasion of India the ''asuras'' sank to the rank of demon. ''Au contraire'', in Iran the ''[[ahura]]s'' were favored, while the ''[[daeva]]s'' fell and opposed truth, spurred in part by Zoroaster's reform. In the old Iranian religion, an ''ahura'' [lord] was concerned with \"the right ordering of the cosmos\".<ref>Zaehner, ''Dawn and Twilight'' (1961), pp. 37 (Varuna as ''asura'', Indra as ''deva''), 39 (''asuras'' lawful), 66 (Ahura Mazdah and Vouruna), 82-83 (laws of Zoroaster, ''asura''), 132 (''Rig Veda'', ''Avesta'').

The period between the ''Dawn'' and the ''Twilight'' was not uneventful. Scholars often differ over conflicting theories of Zoroaster's original message by turns compromised and transformed, a schism that split the religion, survivals of the preexisting [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]], rise of [[Mithraism]], and political opportunism. Also (pp. 134-135): the confusion added by a \"loss of historic memory\" during the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] era, a regional commingling of oral history and heroic tales.</ref> There arose the teachings about ''Zurvan i Akanarak'' [Infinite Time]. The Sasanid state's ideological rationale was sourced in Zoroastrian cosmology and sense of virtue. The ''[[Amesha Spenta]]s'' provided spiritual support for human activities according to an articulated [[mean]] (e.g., \"the just equipoise between excess and deficiency\", Zoroastrian \"law\", and \"wisdom or reason\"). As an ethical principle the ''mean'' followed the contours of the 'treaty' between [[Ohrmazd]] [Ahura Mazda] and [[Ahriman]] [Angra Mainyu], which governed their struggle in Finite Time. Other doctrines came into prominence, such as those about the future saviour [[Saoshyans]] (Zoroaster himself or his posthumous son). Then after the final triumph of the Good Religion the wise lord ''Orhmazd'' \"elevates the whole material creation into the spiritual order, and there the perfection that each created thing has as it issues from the hand of God is restored to it\" in the ''Frashkart'' or \"Making Excellent\".<ref>Zaehner, ''Dawn and Twilight'' (1961), pp. 181\u2013184, 193\u2013247 (Zurvan); pp. 284\u2013301 (Sassanid state: the mean at 285, 286 & 289, 287: quotes; the treaty at 286\u2013287, castes at 284\u2013285); pp. 58\u201360, 299, 317-318 (Saoshyans); pp. 228\u2013229 quote, 296, 302 (the Frashkart).</ref><ref>Cf.

Zaehner, editor: ''Encyclopedia of the World's Religions'' (1959, 1988).</ref> Among these are: ''Concordant Discord'' (1970),<ref>The Giford lecture discussed below.</ref> and ''Our Savage God'' (1974).<ref>Discussed in subsection \"'New Age' drug culture\".</ref>\n\n====Choice of perspective====\nIn the west the academic field of comparative religion at its origins inherited an '[[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]]' ideal of an objective, value-neutral rationalism. Yet traditional Christian and Jewish writings provided much of the source material, as did classical literature, these being eventually joined by non-western religious texts, then empirical ethnological studies.<ref>Zaehner, ''Foolishness to the Greeks'' (1953; 1970).</ref><ref>Academic study itself split into several diverse directions: hybrid sociological and anthropological works, rational and innovative harmonizations of traditional anomalies, updated apologetics, ethical discourse.</ref> The privileged 'enlightenment' orientation in practice fell short of being value-neutral, and itself became progressively contested.<ref>Secular rationalism of the Enlightenment inherited or developed conflicting, shifting stands, e.g., [[Aristotle]]'s prime mover, [[Descartes]]' radical doubt, [[Spinoza]]'s pantheism, [[David Hume|Hume]]'s natural religion, [[Kant]]'s rational critiques, [[Hegel]]'s historicism, [[Kierkegaard]]'s existentialism, [[Nietzsche]]'s irrationalism, [[Freud]]'s psychology (or [[Jung]]'s), [[Max Weber|Weber]]'s sociology (or [[Durkheim]]'s), etc.</ref> As to value-neutral, Zaehner situated himself roughly as follows:\n \n<blockquote>\"Any man with any convictions at all is liable to be influenced by them even when he tries to adopt an entirely objective approach; but let him recognize this from the outset and guard against it. If he does this, he will at least be less liable to deceive himself and others.\" \"Of the books I have written some are intended to be objective; others, quite frankly, are not.\" \"In all my writings on comparative religion my aim has been increasingly to show that there is a coherent pattern in religious history. For me the centre of coherence can only be Christ.\" Yet \"I have rejected as irrelevant to my theme almost everything that would find a natural place in a theological seminary, that is, [[Christian theology]], modern theology in particular.\" \"For what, then, do I have sympathy, you may well ask. Quite simply, for the 'great religions' both of East and West, expressed... in those texts that each religion holds most sacred and in the impact that these have caused.\"<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970), quotes: p.10 (\"Any man\"), p.9 (\"Of the books\"), p.16 (\"In all\"), p. 17-18 (\"I have\"), p.19 (\"For what\").

Yet the academic Zaehner also employed a type of comparative analysis, e.g., often drawing on Zoroastrian or Hindu, or Jewish or Islamic views for contrast, for insight. Often he combined comparison with a default 'modernist' critique, which included psychology or cultural evolution.<ref>Zaehner, ''Christianity and other Religions'' (1964).</ref><ref>Kripal (2001), pp. 156-157.</ref> Zaehner's later works are informed by [[Vatican II]] (1962-1965) and tempered by [[Nostra aetate]].<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970),  pp. 12-15, esp. p.15 re his limits on ''Nostra Aetate''.</ref>\n \t\n====''At Sundry Times''====\n\nIn his 1958 book ''At Sundry Times. An essay in the comparison of religions'',<ref>Reissued by Beacon Press, Boston, in 1962, as ''The Comparison of Religions''. Page references here are to this 1962 edition. The ''At Sundry Times'' title is from [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]], chap. I, verse 1 (p.28). Based on lectures at [[University College of Wales]], which required relevance to Christianity. An appendix (195-217) is added (pp. 9, 10, 195).</ref> Zaehner came to grips with \"the problem of how a Christian should regard the non-Christian religions and how, if at all, he could correlate them into his own\" (p.&nbsp;9 [Preface]). It includes an Introduction (1), followed by chapters on Hinduism (2), on Hinduism and Buddhism (3), on \"Prophets outside Israel\", i.e., Zoroastrianism and Islam (4), and it concludes with Appendix which compares and contrasts the \"Quran and Christ\". Perhaps the key chapter is \"Consummatum Est\" (5), which \"shows, or tries to show, how the main trend in [mystical] Hinduism and Buddhism on the one hand and of [the prophetic] Zoroastrianism on the other meet and complete each other in the Christian revelation\" (Preface, p.&nbsp;9, words in brackets added).\n\t\nThe book opens with a lucid statement of his own contested hermeneutic: \"with comparative religion,\" he says, \"the question is who's to be master, that's all\" (p.&nbsp;9).<ref>This concludes a conversation between [[Humpty-Dumpty]] and [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice]], at page 11 in the Beacon edition.</ref> He starts by saluting [[E. O. James]]. Next Zaehner mentions [[Rudolph Otto]] (1869-1937) and [[al-Ghazali]] (1058-1111) as both being skeptics about any 'reasonable' writer with no religious experience who expounds on the subject. Here Zaehner acknowledges that many Christians may only be familiar with their own type of religion (similar to Judaism and Islam), and hence be ill-equipped to adequately comprehend Hindu or Buddhist mysticism (pp.&nbsp;12\u201315).\n\nZaehner then compared the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Buddha]], the former being a history of God's commandments delivered by his prophets to the Jewish people and their struggle to live accordingly, and the later being a teacher of a path derived from his own experience, which leads to a spiritual enlightenment without God and apart from historical events (pp.&nbsp;15\u201319, 24-26). Needed is a way to bridge this gap between these two (pp.&nbsp;15, 19, 26, 28). The gap is further illustrated as it relates to desire and suffering (p.&nbsp;21), body and soul (pp.&nbsp;22\u201323), personality and death (pp.&nbsp;23\u201324). He announced a 'method' special to the book: \"I shall concern myself with what sincere men have believed\" (p.&nbsp;29).\n\n====''Christianity & other Religions''====\nThe 1964 book,<ref>New York, Hawthorn; concurrently published in London by Burns and Oates as ''The Catholic Church and World Religions''.</ref> following its introduction, has four parts: India, China and Japan, Islam, and The Catholic Church. Throughout Zaehner offers connections between the self-understanding of 'other religions' and that of the Judeo-Christian, e.g., the [[Upanishads]] and [[Thomas Merton]] (pp.&nbsp;25\u201326), [[Taoism]] and [[Adam]] (p.&nbsp;68), [[Sunyata]] and [[Plato]] (p.&nbsp;96), [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[St. Paul]] (p.&nbsp;119-120), [[Samkhya]] and [[Martin Buber]] (pp.&nbsp;131\u2013132).\n\nIn the introduction, Zaehner laments the \"very checkered history\" of the Church. Yet he expresses his admiration of [[John XXIII|Pope John]] (1881-1963), who advanced the dignity that all humanity possesses \"in the sight of God\". Zaehner then presents a brief history of Christianity in world context. The Church \"rejoiced to build into herself whatever in Paganism she found compatible\" with the revelation and ministry of Jesus. Her confidence was inferred in the words of [[Gamaliel]] (pp.&nbsp;7\u20139).<ref>Zaehner, ''Christianity'' (1964), p.9: The Jewish teacher Gamaliel stated that nothing will stop Christianity \"if it be of God\".</ref> While Europe has known of Jesus for twenty centuries, 'further' Asia has only for three. Jesus, however, seemed to have arrived there with conquerors from across the sea, and \"not as the suffering servant\" (p.&nbsp;9).<ref>Matthew 4,&nbsp;8-10 is quoted by Zaehner, ''Christianity'' (1964), p.9, regarding the temptation of Jesus in the desert, by Satan who promised him all the kingdoms of the world.</ref> As to the ancient traditions of Asia, Christians did \"condemn outright what [they had] not first learnt to understand\" (pp.&nbsp;11, 13). Zaehner thus sets the stage for a modern review of ancient traditions.\n\n\"The Catholic Church\" chapter starts by celebrating its inclusiveness. Zaehner quotes [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]] praising the early Church's absorption of [[classical antiquity|classical Mediterranean]] virtues (a source some term 'heathen').<ref>Cf., Zaehner, ''Our Savage God'' (1974), where Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato, and Aristotle are extensively discussed.</ref> For \"from the beginning the Moral Governor of the world has scattered the seeds of truth far and wide... .\"<ref>Zaehner, ''Christianity'' (1964), p.128 (term 'heathen'; Newman quote).</ref> There may be some danger for Christians to study the spiritual truths of other religions, but it is found in scripture.<ref>[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 17:26-28, ([[St. Paul]] at the [[Areopagus]] in Athens). Zaehner (1964) then artfully quotes St. Paul's words to the philosophers (pp. 128-129).</ref>\n\nZaehner counsels that the reader not \"neglect the witness\" of Hinduism and Buddhism, as they teach inner truths which, among Christians, have withered and faded since the one-sided [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The Church perpetually struggles to keep to a \"perfect yet precarious balance between the transcendent... Judge and King and the indwelling Christ\". Writing in 1964, Zaehner perceived \"a change for the better\" in the increasing acceptance of the \"Yogin in India or Zen in Japan\". Nonetheless, a danger exists for the 'unwary soul' who in exploring other religions may pass beyond the fear of God. Then one may enter the subtleties of mystical experience, and \"mistake his own soul for God.\" Such an error in distinguishing between ''timeless states'' can lead to ego inflation, spiritual vanity, and barrenness.<ref>Zaehner, ''Christianity'' (1964), quotes: first 129, three at 130, last 131. Zaehner further discusses the 'mystic mistake' at pp. .</ref><ref>Fernandes (2004), p.89 (spiritual pride may lead to barrenness).</ref><ref>Cf. [[Miguel Asin Palacios|Asin Palacios]], ''St. John of the Cross and Islam'' (1981), pp. 11-14, 25: renunciation of 'expansion' (''bas\u1e6d'', ''anchura''); 20-22: danger of \"spiritual vanity\".</ref>\n\nZaehner offers this categorical analysis of some major religious affiliations: a) action-oriented, worldly (Judaism, Islam, Protestantism, Confucianism); b) contemplation-oriented, other-worldly (Hinduism, Theravada Buddhism, Taoism); c) in-between (Mahayana Buddhism, neo-Confucianism, the reformed Hinduism of Gandhi, the Catholic Church).<ref>Zaehner, ''Christianity'' (1964), p.22.</ref>\n\n===Mystical experience===\n[[Scholarly approaches of mysticism|Mysticism as an academic field of study]] is relatively recent, emerging from earlier works with a religious and literary accent. From reading the writings of mystics, various traditional distinctions have been further elaborated, such as its psychological nature and its social-cultural context. Discussions have also articulated its phenomenology as a personal experience versus how it has  been interpreted by the mystic or by others.<ref>Cf. Michael Stoebel, [http://religion.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.001.0001/acrefore-9780199340378-e-93 \"The comparative study of mysticism\"] in the ''Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion'' (New York 2015). Accessed 2015-4-22.</ref> Professor Zaehner made his contributions, e.g., to its comparative analysis and its typology.\n\n====''Sacred and Profane''====\nAfter Zaehner's initial works on Zoroastrianism, ''Mysticism. Sacred and Profane'' (1957) was his first published on another subject. It followed his assumption of the [[Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics|Spalding]] chair at [[All Souls College]], Oxford. The book's conversational style delivers clarity and wisdom on a difficult subject, and along the way are found many illuminating digressions and asides.\n\nThe profane side is first addressed with regard to the use of [[mescaline]]. Zaehner himself carefully took this natural psychedelic drug. He discussed in particular [[Aldous Huxley]], especially in his popular 1954 book ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (pp.&nbsp;1\u201329, 208-226). Next, the subject of nature mystics is described and appraised, including two examples from literature: [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] (pp.&nbsp;30\u201383). 'Madness', it is also pointed out, may sometimes result in mental states that accord with those of the mystics (p.&nbsp;84-105).\n\nA chapter \"Integration and isolation\" takes a comparative view, discussing mystics of Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam, as well as [[Carl Jung|Jung]]'s psychology. Integration is described as nature mysticism joined to the intellect, whereby reason and the unconscious nourish one another (p.&nbsp;114). Isolation refers to [[Samkhya]] mysticism, whereby the ''purusa'' (the soul) and ''prakrti'' (nature) are separated (p.&nbsp;106-128). About the Hindu mystics, Zaehner contrasts Samkhya, a dualist doctrine associated with the Yoga method, and non-dualist [[Vedanta]], a monism inspired by the ''[[Upanishads]]''. The relative merits of Monism verses Theism, and vice versa, are discussed (pp.&nbsp;153\u2013197). Near the end of his conclusion, Zaehner repeats his view that the monist and the theistic are \"distinct and mutually opposed types of mysticism\" (p.&nbsp;204).\n\n====''Hindu and Muslim''====\nHis innovative 1960 book compares the mystical literature and practice of [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s. He frames it with a theme of diversity.<ref>Zaehner, ''Hindu and Muslim Mysticism'' (1960, 1969), \"Preface\" at vii\u2013viii.</ref> On experiential foundations, Zaehner then commences to explore the spiritual treasures left to us by the mystics of the [[Santana Dharma]], and of the [[Sufi]] [[tariqa]]s. Often he offers a phenomenological description of the reported experiences, after which he interprets them in various theological terms.<ref>[[Junayd of Baghdad|Junayd]] (pp. 135-153), and [[Al-Ghazali|Ghazali]] (153\u2013175) are thereafter discussed. Zaehner (1960, 1969).</ref>\n\nFollowing [[S. N. Dasgupta|Surendranath N. Dasgupta]], Zaehner describes five different types of mysticism to be found in Indian tradition: \"the [[Yajna|sacrificial]], the [[Upanishad#Philosophy|Upanishadic]], the [[Yoga|Yogic]], the [[Four stages of enlightenment|Buddhistic]], and that of ''[[bhakti]]''.\"<ref>Zaehner, ''Hindu and Muslim Mysticism'' (1960, 1969) at 6\u201311. Zaehner credits (p.6) Dasgupta's ''Hindu Mysticism'' for the initial typology.</ref><ref>[[S. N. Dasgupta|Surendranath N. Dasgupta]], ''Hindu Mysticism'' (Chicago: Open Court 1927; republished by Frederick Unger, New York, 1959). Dasgupta gave six lectures: Sacrificial, Upanishads, Yoga, Buddhistic, Classical Devotional, and Popular Devotional. Starting in 1922, the University of Cambridge published his ''A History of Indian Philosophy'' in five volumes.</ref> Zaehner here has chosen to rely on Hindu mystics because of their relative freedom from creed or dogma. He leaves aside the first (of historic interest), and the fourth (due to contending definitions of [[nirvana]]), so that as exemplars of mystical experience he presents:\n\n*(a) the Upanishadic \"I am this All\" which can be subdivided into (i) a [[theism|theistic]] interpretation or (ii) a [[monism|monistic]];\n*(b) the Yogic \"unity\" outside space and time, either (i) of the eternal monad of the mystic's own individual soul per the ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'' of [[Patanjali]] or (ii) of [[Brahman]], the ground of the universe, per the [[advaita]] [[Vedanta]] of [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]]; and,\n*(c) the Bhakti mysticism of love, according to the commentary on the [[Bhagavad Gita]] by [[Ramanuja]].<ref>Zaehner, ''Hindu and Muslem Mysticism'' (1960, 1969) at 19, 6 & 10; (a) 7\u20139, 17; (b) 9\u201310, 13, 17; (c) 11, 14\u201316, 17\u201318. Zaehner quotes at length from [[Martin Buber]] on mystical experience, at 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nBased on the above schematic, the resulting study of the mystics of the two religions must necessarily be asymmetrical. The sufis of Islam are approached from a Hindu perspective; indeed, many of the Muslim mystics are from the subcontinent of India. Yet the study provides thoughtful appraisls and insights.\n\n====Comparative mysticism====\nIn his work on comparative religion, Zaehner directly addressed [[mysticism]], particularly in Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. He criticized the then widely-held view that in mystical experience was to be found the key to the unity of all religions. He based his contrary views on well-known texts authored by the mystics of various traditions. Zaehner, after describing their first-hand reports of experiences of extraordinary states of consciousness, presented also their traditional interpretations. The result seems to indicate a great variety of mystical experience, and clear differences in how these were understood theologically. Many experiences seems to evidence a particular world view, e.g., theisms, monisms, dualisms, pantheisms, or agnostic.<ref>E.g., Zaehner, ''Mysticism. Sacred and Profane'' (1957, 1961) at 168.</ref><ref>Cf., Dummett (1981), p. xiii.</ref>\n\nHis critique challenged the thesis of [[Richard Bucke]], developed in his 1901 book, ''[[Cosmic Consciousness]]''. Bucke describes certain lesser facilities, followed by accounts of the prized 'cosmic' state of mind. Fourteen exemplary people of history as presented, shown as each reaching a somewhat similar realization: the plane of cosmic consciousness.<ref>Richard Maurice Bucke, ''Cosmic Consciousness.

Zaehner does not dispute that these spiritual visionaries reach a distinguishable level of awareness. Nor does he deny that by following a disciplined life sequence over time one may be led to mystical experience: withdrawal, [[Ego death|purgation]], illumination. Instead, what Zaeher suggests is a profound difference between, e.g., the pantheistic vision of a nature mystic, admittedly pleasant and wholesome, and the personal union of a theist with the Divine lover of humankind.<ref>Zaehner, ''Mysticism. Sacred and Profane'' (1957), pp. 118, 149, 204; cf., 66-67.</ref><ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970), pp. 46\u201348.</ref><ref>Reardon (2011).</ref><ref>Newell (1981), pp. 1-5, 53-55.</ref><ref>Schebera (1978), pp. 20-24.

Zaehner dismisses the [[reductionism]] of Leuba, \"his thesis that mysticism can be explained in terms of pure psychology without any reference to God as a reality distinct from the soul.\"</ref><ref>[[James H. Leuba]], ''The Psychology of Religious Mysticism'' (New York: Harcourt, Brace 1925).

''Au contraire'', a Hindu mystic following a rival school of Vedanta may understand the same tranquil, steady illumination differently (i.e., as not Samkhya's purusa). As Zaehner proposed: the same or similar mystical experience may result in very different theological interpretations.<ref>Zaehner, ''Mysticism. Sacred and Profane'' (1957). The Samkhya-yoga and the Advaita Vedanta may interpret differently what is a very similar mystical experience (pp. 146, 153, 164, 204). A major thrust of Zaehner's 1957 book is his typology, i.e., he demonstrates the actual ''variety'' of mystical experiences (of what many had assumed were the same); then he divides them into three or four categories (168,184,198). Yet, ironically, Zaehner here also shows that the same or similar experiences may be interpreted very differently, e.g., as Samkhya-yoga or as Advaita Vedanta.</ref><ref>Zaehner, ''Hindu and Muslim'' (1960), pp. 38-39 (Yoga and Vedanta compared).</ref><ref>Fernandes (2004), pp. 57-58.</ref>\n\nInstead of the isolated purusa experience of Samkhya, the Advaita Vedanta mystic might interpret it as the experience of the Self, which illuminates the mystic's direct connection to the all-inclusive entity of ''cosmic totality''. Such a numinous, universal Self is called [[Brahman]] (''[[Sanskrit]]'': sacred power),<ref>Zaehner, ''The City within the Heart'' (1981), p. 21 (etymologies: Brahman, Atman).</ref> or [[Paramatma]].<ref>Zaehner, ''Hinduism'' (1962, 1966), Brahman (pp. 36-56), the Brahman-Atman synthesis, \"Brahman-Atman-Purusha\" (49-50).</ref><ref>[[B. K. S. Iyengar]], ''[[Light on Yoga]]'' (London 1965, reprint NY: Schocken 1966), p.21. In not-Samkhya Hinduism, the individual yogin's \"Antaratma (the inner self)\" may be realized as connected to the sacred ''Paramatma'' (pp. 21, 23-24), also called the Brahman (pp. 314, 315, 325).</ref> Here, the Samkhya understands an isolated, purified, eternal purusa (self); the contrary Vedanta mystic would experience a connection to the cosmic Brahman.<ref>Fernandes (2004), p.35 (mystical experience similar, theological interpretation different).</ref><ref>Cf., [[John P. Dourley]], \"Jung's equation of the ground of being with the ground of the psyche\" in ''The Journal of Analytical Psychology'' (Routledge 2011), v. 56/4, pp. 514-531.</ref>\n\nHence, the mystical experience (briefly outlined here) is differently interpreted; the subject: (1) may achieve, by separation from prakriti (nature), the goal of immortality of her purusa, purified in isolation within herself; or (2) may become absorbed by discovery of her direct identity with the divine, immortal, luminous Brahman,<ref>Iyengar, ''Light on Yoga'' (1965, 1966). Iyengar declares that his view of yoga leads one to experience the \"Supreme Universal Spirit\" or ''Paramatma'' (p.21), and to a conscious state of \"''Supreme Bliss''\" (p.53). Cf. p.49: \"union with the Creator\". Thus, Iyengar indicates that [[Iyengar yoga|his yoga]] does not follow Samkhya (it might be a hybrid Vedanta or [[Bhakti yoga]]).</ref> Accordingly, in Zaehner's terms, such experience may be either (1) a ''dualistic'' Samkhya atheism, or (2) a ''monistic'' type of Advaita Vedanta. Neither for Zaehner can be called ''theistic'', i.e., in neither case is there an interactive, sacred experience with a numinous personality.<ref>Zaehner, ''Mysticism.

Decades later he published ''The [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] and World Religions'' (1964), expressly from that perspective.

He also taught himself a related language, [[Sanskrit]], used to write the early Hindu sacred books. Decades later he was asked by [[Oxford University Press|OUP]] to author a volume on [[Hinduism]].

Zaehner discusses, among other things, the subtleties of [[dharma]], and [[Yudhishthira]], the son of Dharma, who became the King of righteousness (''dharma raja''). Yudhishthira is the elder of five brothers of the royal [[Pandava]] family, who leads one side in the war of the ''Mahabharata''. Accordingly, he struggles to follow his conscience, to do the right thing, to avoid slaughter and bloodshed. Yet he finds that tradition and custom, and the Lord [[Krishna]], are ready to allow the usual killing and mayhem of warfare.<ref>\"The ''Mahabharata'' is a strange kind of book,\" writes Zaeher. As a major hero \"Yudhishthira shows sympathy\" for criticism about the \"injustice\" in the caste laws (''dharma'') for warriors (''kshatriya'').

Yet their situations differed. Yudhishthira, although ascetic by nature, was a royal leader who had to directly face the conflicts of his society. His realm and his family suffered great misfortunes due to political conflict and war. Yet the divine [[Krishna]] evidently considered the war and the destructive duties of the warrior (the ''[[kshatriya]] dharma'') acceptable. The wealthy householder Job, a faithful servant of his Deity, suffers severe family and personal reversals, due to Divine acquiescence. Each human being, both Job and Yudhishthira, is committed to following his righteous duty, acting in conforming to his conscience.<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970): Yudhishthira and Job (pp. 178, 179, 355). The ''Book of Job'' proper becomes focus of Zaehner in Ch. XVII, pp. 346-355.

The second time Yudhishthira agrees to roll the dice, it is expressly stated because he cannot disobey his elder, Dhrtarastra (bk. 2, ch. 67, v. 1\u20134; p. 158). Vidura and Dhrtarastra are his uncles.</ref> Despite, or because of, his devotion to the law of ''dharma'', Yudhishthira then \"allowed himself be tricked into a game of dice.\" In contesting against very cunning and clever players, he gambles \"his kingdom and family away.\" His wife becomes threatened with slavery.<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970). p. 179 (quotes about the dice game).</ref><ref>Zaehner, ''Hinduism'' (1962, 1966), p. 107 (the fateful game of dice).</ref><ref>Bose, ''The Book of Yudhisthir'' (1986), pp. 26, 29:n1, 87:n1 (Yudhishthira rolls the dice, commentary).

Although Yudhishthira is the King of [[Dharma]], eventually he harshly criticizes the bloody duties of a warrior (the ''[[kshatriya]] dharma''), duties imposed also on kings. Yudhishthira himself prefers the \"constant virtues\" mandated by the dharma of a [[brahmin]]. \"Krishna represents the old order,\" interprets Zaehner, where \"trickery and violence\" hold \"an honorable place\".<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970, p. 177 (quote: holy); p. 179 (quotes: defend, justify); p. 177 (Draupadi's quote about Krishna). Yudhishthira at first \"defends the established order\" (pp. 178\u2013179). He prefers the brahmin's dharma over the kshatriya's (pp. 177, 179, 184, 188). Draupadi attacks Krishna (pp. 177-178, 347), attacks Yudhishthira (p. 186). Yudhishthira does not attack Krishna, but becomes disgusted with \"a warrior's duty to kill,\" saying after the destructive war:\n<blockquote>\"Cursed be the ''kshatriya'' code, cursed be physical strength, cursed be violence through which we have been brought to our present pass. Blessed be long-suffering, self-control, purity, freedom from strife and slander, refusal to do another harm, truthful speech, the constant virtues... \"(p. 184).</blockquote></ref><ref>''The Mahabharata'' [Bks. 2 & 3], trans. and ed. by von Buitenen (1975), Yudhishthira about the brahmins (cf. bk. 3, ch. 177; pp. 563-565).

On his return to [[Bengal]] in India, he studied its [[Sanskrit literature|ancient literature]] in Sanskrit. He later became a major political orator with a spiritual dimension, a [[Political history of Sri Aurobindo|prominent leader]] for Indian independence. Hence he was jailed. There in 1908 he had a religious experience. Relocating to the then French port of [[Pondicherry]], he became a [[yogin]] and was eventually recognized as a Hindu sage.

Aurobindo's teaching was a \"clear break\" from both [[Sankhya Yoga]] which \"made the sharpest distinction between Spirit and matter\" and from the Vedanta of [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] (p.10).

The Power of Consciousness is also called the divine \"descent of the 'Supermind',\" a spirit of pure consciousness. Otherwise, without such a transformation of selfish humans, Aurobindo considered any utopia impossible, and that promised by communists as a vain illusion leading to tyranny (pp. 28-29, 30-31). Zaehner analogizes the Power of Consciousness (Supermind) to Jesus as Logos (pp. 35, 38-39, 77, but cf. 31); cf., Christianity and [[Satcitananda|''sac-cid-\u0101nanda'']] [Being-Consciousness-Joy] (pp. 13, 48, 74).</ref> Adherents of Aurobindo's new [[Integral Yoga]] (''Purna Yoga'') would lead India to a spiritual awakening; they would facilitate an increasingly common soul-experience, in which each achieves a mystic union with the One. Each such ''gnosis'' would also be guided by the Power of Consciousness. In choosing to pursue the realization of such social self-understanding, India would hasten the natural evolution of humanity.<ref>Naravane, ''Modern Indian Thought'' ([1964], 1978): The process of cosmic evolution is preceded by an involution (p. 207), by which the material world is infused with consciousness by the Absolute; thereafter comes the ''creative'' evolution. Eventually humans appear and advance until the Supramental links us to pure consciousness, an Absolute: then everyone becomes transformed (pp. 204\u2013205).

The state of gnosis \"is impossible without ample and close self-identification of ourselves with all existence\" (p.558). To \"learn how to be one self with all\" is key, \"without it there is no gnosis\" (p.559). Gnosis changes \"all our view and experience of our soul-life and of the world around us\" as it is \"the decisive transition in the [[Yoga]]\" (p.542).

In these sessions he revisits comparative mysticism and Bucke, focuses on Hinduism and Buddhism, Yudhishthira and later Job, discusses Taoist classics, Neo-Confucianism, and Zen. He doesn't forget Jung or Zoroaster, Marx or Teilhard. The result is a 464-page book: ''Concordant Discord. The Interdependence of Faiths''.\n\nIn the course of the discourse, he mentions occasionally a sophisticated view: how the different religions have provided a mutuality of nourishment, having almost unconsciously interpenetrated each other's beliefs. The historically obfuscated result is that neighbouring religions might develop the other's theological insights as their own, as well as employ the other's distinctions to accent, or explain, their own doctrines to themselves. Although Zaehner gives a suggestive commentary at the conjunction of living faiths, he respects that each remains distinct, unique. Zaehner allows the possibility of what he calls the convergence of faiths, or solidarity.<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970). Preface. Zaehner writes of the \"missing link\" between Zen and theism ( p. 304), and \"the Hindu bridge\" (p. 297), as pathways to convergence.</ref><ref>Newell, ''Struggle and Submission'' (1981), pp. 24-33 (convergence, solidarity). A false convergence is also possible (p. 252).</ref>\n\nRegarding the world religions Zaehner held, however, that we cannot use the occasional occurrence of an ironic [[syncretism]] among elites as a platform from which to leap to a unity within current religions. His rear-guard opinions conflicted with major academic trends then prevailing. \"In these [[ecumenical]] days it is unfashionable to emphasize the difference between religions.\" Yet Zaehner remained skeptical, at the risk of alienating those in the ecumenical movement whose longing for a festival of conciliation caused them to overlook the stubborn divergence inherent in the momentum. \"We must force nothing: we must not try to achieve a 'harmony' of religions at all costs when all we can yet see is a 'concordant discord'... . At this early stage of contact with the non-Christian religions, this surely is the most that we can hope for.\"<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970), p. 383 (\"unfashionable\" quote), p. 7 (\"force nothing\" quote).

[T]he ''Genesis'' story has to be interpreted against the background of our evolutionary origin. Once we do this, then the Fall begins to look more like an ascent than a degradation.

Cf. excess in western religion, pp. 30-31.</ref> If practiced under the guidance of traditional religious teachers, no harm usually results.<ref>Zaehner, ''Zen, Drugs and Mysticism'' (1972), p. 125-127 re Zen, per Abbot Shibayama.

After arriving at such a transcendent point, a troubled drug user may go wrong by feeling licensed to do anything, with no moral limit. The misuse of a mystical state and its theology eventually can lead to an horrific end.<ref>Zaehner, ''Our Savage God'' (1974), pp. 47, 288, 306 (Charles Manson's \"mysticism\").</ref><ref>Sethna, ''Spirituality of the Future'' (1981), in his Chap. 10, pp. 208-220, challenges Zaehner's criticism of \"the idea of an amoral or immoral component in Indian mysticism\" (p.210, quote). Sethna refers to Zaehner's ''Evolution in Religion'' (1971), pp. 18-20, which discusses \"a state so rudimentary that self-awareness and the moral sense have yet to arise\" (p.210, quote).</ref>\n\nZaehner warned of the misbehavior propagated by [[LSD]] advocate [[Timothy Leary]],<ref>Zaehner, ''Zen, Drugs and Mysticiam'' (1972), Leary: pp. 66-67, 69-75, 83-87.</ref><ref>Timothy Leary, ''The Politics of Ecstasy'' (1970).</ref> the earlier satanism of [[Aleister Crowley]],<ref>Zaehner, ''Our Savage God'' (1974), Crowley: pp. 40-47.</ref> and ultimately the criminal depravity of [[Charles Manson]].<ref>Zaehner, ''Our Savage God'' (1974), Manson: pp. 47-72. Zaehner tells how Manson was underprivileged, son of a teenage prostitute (p.51), an ex-convict whose maleducation trickled down from local occult sects (pp. 46, 59). His enemy was society (pp. 48-50, 55-56, 306-307). He preached to die to the world, by exhaustion, drugs and sex, to break-down the ego (pp. 60, 62, 69), in order to attain an indifference (pp. 60, 66-67, cf. 80). So broken, his followers committed horrific crimes (pp. 47, 56, 67).</ref><ref>[[Ed Sanders]] in his ''The Family'' (New York: Dutton 1972; reprint Avon 1972) describes the occult indoctrination used by Manson, and his loopy rationale of the murders. Zaehner quotes it and obtained knowledge of Manson's crimes from it.

His concluding appraisal of the LSD experience, although not without warning of its great risks and dangers, contained a limited, circumscribed allowance for use with a spiritual guide.<ref>Zaehner, ''Zen, Drugs and Mysticism'' (1972), pp. 133-134.</ref><ref>Cf. ''[[The Economist]]'', June 25, 2011, \"Acid Test. Research into hallucinogenic drugs begins to shake off decades of taboo\" p. 95; e.g., medical treatments, biotechnology.</ref><ref>Cf., Weiner, ''9 1/2 Mystics. The Kabbala today'' (1969, reprint 1971). Leary's \"suggestion that religious experiences may be achieved by drugs... is likely to remind a traditional Jew of Canaanite paganism, which used all kind of orgiastic rites, including drugs, to produce states of so-called expanded consciousness. \u00b6 Nevertheless, the question persists... \" (pp. 330-331). \"The answer might go something like this: \u00b6 Make room for the aberant... who bear within themselves those spores of creation which society needs for its own regeneration\" (p.333).</ref>\n\n=====''Drugs, Mysticism''=====\n\nAs its title indicates, the book addresses a range of contemporary issues.<ref>Zaehner, ''Drugs, Mysticism and Make-believe''. William Collins, London, 1972. Its American title: ''Zen, Drugs, and Mysticism''. Pantheon Books, New York, 1972.</ref> It was expanded from three talks he gave on [[British Broadcasting Company|BBC]] radio in 1970, which were printed in [[The Listener (magazine)|''The Listener'']] [9]. Although admittedly it repeats some material from his prior books, it is \"aimed at a wider audience\" (p.&nbsp;9).\n\nIn his appraisal of [[LSD]] the [[psychedelic drug]] and its relevance to mysticism, Zaehner discussed the drug's popular advocate [[Timothy Leary]] and his 1970 book.<ref>Leary, ''The Politics of Ecstasy'' (London: MacGibbon and Kee 1970; New York: G. P. Putnam 1970).</ref> Zaehner comments that, to the inexperienced, \"most descriptions of Zen enlightenment, and some of LSD experience would appear to be almost identical.\" What Leary calls the \"timeless energy process around you\" (pp.&nbsp;113\u2013114 quote; 70 & 112 quote). Yet Zaehner refers to [[Krishnamurti]] of India, and zen abbot [[Zenkei Shibayama]] of Japan. Apparently each describes a crucial difference between meditation and such experiences as LSD (pp.&nbsp;114\u2013116).\n\nThe celebration of sex while under its influence by Leary and also by many in the drug culture Zaehner compared to the frequent use of sexual imagery by the mystics of different religious cultures [63, 66-70]. Even though passages in Leary's book comport with the Hindu [[Upanishads]], Zaehner writes that by Leary's near deification of sexuality he \"would appear to part company\" with most nature mystics and, e.g., with St. [[Francis de Sales]], who distinguishes mystical ecstasy and sexual ecstasy (pp.&nbsp;68\u201369, 70 quote). In later discussing [[Georges Bernanos]],<ref>French novelist Georges Bernanos (1888-1948) distinguished between lust and sexual desire (prior to the [[sexual revolution]]); he was not a mystic (p.&nbsp;175).</ref> Zaehner opines that \"sex without love\" would constitute an abandonment of the virtues (pp.&nbsp;174\u2013175).\n\nZaehner discusses Carl Jung and his 1952 book ''Answer to Job'' (pp.&nbsp;163\u2013170).\n\n=====''Our Savage God''=====\n\nThe book's title is somewhat misleading.<ref>''Our Savage God. The Perverse use of Eastern Thought'' Sheed & Ward, New York, 1974.</ref> It attaches well, however, to its first chapter, \"Rot in the Clockwork Orange\", about the putative rationale of then contemporary episodes of mayhem and murder. About the [[Charles Manson|hippie psychotic fringe]], it made world headlines. Zaehner's focus is not on usual criminality but on hideous acts claiming a religious sanction, that with sinister cunning fakes the '[[new age]]' (p.&nbsp;12). The chapter's title refers to [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|the 1962 novel]] by [[Anthony Burgess]] and [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|the 1971 film]] by [[Stanley Kubrick]] (p.&nbsp;35). Portrayed therein is crazy, soul-killing violence.<ref>The novel and film are discussed in unavoidable graphic language (pp.&nbsp;19-73: 35-40, esp. 36).</ref><ref>Carlo Cereti (1976-1977). ''Our Savage God'' was \"written on the emotional wave following the murder of the actress [[Sharon Tate]] and some of her friends by members of a cult led by Charles Manson.\"</ref>\n\nYet, very differently, about his book on the whole Zaehner says its hero is [[Aristotle]]. The supporting cast is drawn from his \"philosophical milieu\" (p.&nbsp;14). The next four chapters cover: [[Heraclitus]] per a dialectical unity of opposites (pp. 92, 102);<ref>Zaehner, ''Dialectical Christianity'' (1971), p.37.</ref> [[Parmenides]] whose ''Way of Truth'' is compared to the [[Vedanta]]'s Brahman (121-122); [[Plato]] (141-160); and the [[Stagira (ancient city)|stagirite]] hero who arrives at [[Being]], akin to ''[[Satcitananda|Sat-Cit-Ananda]]'' (p.&nbsp;192). As indicated, Zaehner offers a comparison of these Ancient Greek philosophers to the Vedic wisdom of ancient India, especially the [[Mythopoeic thought|mythopoetic]] element in the ''[[Upanishads]]'' (e.g., p.&nbsp;133-138).\n\nYet this philosophical theme is somewhat misleading as well, for Zaehner intermittently interjects the ever-present and unwelcome possibility of criminality and mayhem. [[Charles Manson]] on occasion appears as the personification of the evil side of contemporary drug culture. His depraved mystical con-game provides some unappetizing food for thought.<ref>See section above \"Popular and drug culture\" re footnote about Manson's life. Also, here (e.g., pp.&nbsp;51\u201375).</ref>\n\n==Quotations==\n\n*There is indeed a sharp division between those religions whose characteristic form of religious experience is prayer and adoration of [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]'s God of [[Abraham]], God of Isaac, God of Jacob on the one hand, and religions in which sitting postures designed to find the [[Dharmic religions|God within]] you are thought to be the most appropriate way of approaching the Deity.<ref>Zaehner, ''Our Savage God'' (1974) p. 234 (quote).</ref><ref>Cf., Zaehner, ''Comparison of Religions'' (1958, 1962), p.30: \"The prophet confronts the mystic: and each speaks a different language that is not comprehensible to the other.\"</ref>\n*[[C.

Hence his \"self\" is as hard to grasp as the Indian ''[[\u0100tman (Hinduism)|atman]]''.<ref>Zaehner, \"A New Buddha and a New Tao\" pp. 402\u2013412, at 403 (quote), in ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Living Faiths'' (1959; 1967), edited by Zaehner.</ref><ref>C.

She says he marshals scripture, and evidence on the divine presence, death, and resurrection in the Haoma sacrifice, so that it resembles \"the Christian communion rite\". \"But if all the material is properly taken into consideration... its intention appears as something very different\" (p. 164).  She cites [[A. Berriedale Keith]], ''The religion and philosophy of the Veda and Upanishads, vol. II'' (Harvard Oriental Series 1925, reprint 1970), pp. 332. Keith states that for the Brahman ''soma'' ritual, there was \"no serious or real feeling for the death of a god\" (p. 460). The same applies for the Iranian ''haoma'' (Keith, p.326,n2). Cf., Boyce (1975), p.165.</ref>\n*The whole [[ascetic]] tradition, whether it be Buddhist, Platonist, [[Manichaean]], Christian or Islamic, springs from that most polluted of all sources, the Satanic sin of pride, the desire to be 'like gods'.

He understood the original language of many sacred texts, e.g., Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic. Earlier, starting in World War II, he had served as an intelligence officer in [[Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran|Iran]]. At Oxford University his first writings had been on the [[Zoroastrian]] religion and its texts. Appointed [[Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics|Spalding Professor]], his books addressed such subjects as [[Scholarly approaches of mysticism|mystical experience]] (articulating a widely cited typology), [[Hinduism]], [[comparative religion]], [[Christianity and other religions]], and ethics. He translated the [[Bhagavad-Gita]], providing an extensive commentary based on Hindu tradition and sources. His last books addressed similar issues in popular culture, which led to his talks on the [[British Broadcasting Company|BBC]]. He published under the name R. C. Zaehner.<ref>Before becoming an Oxford professor he had been known as Robin Zaehner.

Zaehner \"was bilingual in French and English from early childhood. He remained an excellent linguist all his life.\"<ref>[[Ann K. S.

She identifies his ancestry as \"Swiss German\",</ref><ref>Editorial insert, \"The Author\", in Zaehner, ''The Teaching of the Magi'' (1956; 1976), p. 5 (bilingual).</ref> Educated at the nearby [[Tonbridge School]], he was admitted to [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he studied [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]], and also [[Zoroastrian Middle Persian|ancient Persian]] including [[Avestan language|Avestan]], gaining first class honours in Oriental Languages. During 1936\u201337 he studied [[Pahlavi script|Pahlavi]], another ancient [[Iranian language]], with Sir [[Harold Bailey]] at [[Cambridge University]]. Thereafter Zaehner held Prof. Bailey in high esteem.<ref>Zaehner called Prof. Bailey \"perhaps the greatest [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] [[philologist]] of our time\".

He later acquired a reading knowledge of [[Sanskrit]] (for Hindu scriptures), [[Pali]] (for Buddhist), and [[Arabic]] (for Islamic).<ref>[[Michael Dummett]], \"Introduction\" pp. xi\u2013xix, at p. xiii (quote), to Zaehner's posthumous ''The City within the Heart'' (1981).</ref> In 1939 he taught as a research lecturer at [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. During this period, he read the French poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]], and the [[Sufi]] poet of Iran [[Rumi]], as well as studying the Hindu [[Upanishads]]. Zaehner came then to adopt a personal brand of \"nature mysticism\". Yet his spiritual progression led him a few years later to convert to Christianity, becoming a [[Roman Catholic]] while stationed in Iran.<ref>[[Geoffrey Parrinder]], \"Robert Charles Zaehner (1913\u20131974)\" in ''History of Religion'' 16: 66\u201374, 74 (1976).</ref>\n\n===British intelligence===\n\nDuring [[World War II]] starting in 1943, he served as a [[British intelligence]] officer at their Embassy in [[Tehran]]. Often he was stationed in the field among the mountain tribes of northern Iran. After the war he also performed a more diplomatic role at the Tehran embassy.<ref>Alana Howard, \"Gifford Lecture ''Biography''.\"</ref><ref>[[Nigel West]], ''At Her Majesty's Secret Service.

He was responsible for MI6 [[counterintelligence]] in Persia during the war. It was difficult and dangerous work. The railway lines into Russia, carrying vital military supplies, were key targets for German sabotage. Zaehner was perfectly equipped for the job, speaking the local dialects fluently, and much of his time was spent undercover, operating in the murky and cutthroat world of countersabotage. By the end of the war his task was even more fraught. The Russians themselves were trying to gain control of the railway, and Zaehner had to work behind Russian lines, continuously at risk of betrayal and murder by pro-German or pro-Russian... .\"<ref>Peter Wright, ''[[Spycatcher]].

C. Zaehner\" {website}.</ref> and as an [[MI6]] officer. He then resumed his academic career at Oxford doing research on Zoroastrianism. During 1949, however, he was relocated to [[Malta]] where he trained [[Albanian Subversion|anti-Communist Albanians]]. By 1950 he had secured an [[Oxford University|Oxford]] appointment as lecturer in [[Persian literature]]. Again in 1951\u20131952 he returned to Iran for government service. Prof. [[Ann K. S. Lambton|Nancy Lambton]], who had run British propaganda in Iran during the war, recommended him for the Embassy position. Journalist [[Christopher de Bellaigue]] describes Robin Zaehner as \"a born networker who knew everyone who mattered in Tehran\" with a taste for gin and opium. \"When [[Kingsley Martin]], the editor of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', asked Zaehner at a cocktail party in Tehran what book he might read to enlarge his understanding of Iran, Zaehner suggested ''[[Alice through the Looking Glass]]''.\"<ref>[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], ''Patriot of Persia.

Zaehner enjoyed a \"large number of Persian friends.\"</ref><ref>'Ali Mirdrakvandi, an Iranian peasant from [[Luristan]], worked awhile for Zaehner. He wrote a fantastic story in his self-taught English. It was later edited by John Hemming and published, with a foreword by Zaehner, as ''[[No Heaven for Gunga Din]].

During the [[Abadan Crisis]] he was assigned to prolong the [[Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi|Shah]]'s royal hold on the [[Sun Throne]] against the republican challenge led by [[Mohammed Mossadegh]], then the [[Prime Minister of Iran|Prime Minister]]. The crisis involved the [[Anglo-Iranian Oil Company]] which had been in effect [[nationalization|nationalised]] by Mossadegh. Zaehner thus became engaged in the failed 1951 British effort to topple the government of Iran and return oil production to that entity controlled by the British government.<ref>Mehrzad Boroujerdi, ''Iranian Intellectuals and the West. The tormented triumph of nativism'' (Syracuse Univ. 1996) at 33, 38\u201339. The 1951 coup staged by Britain alone failed due to Mossadegh's popularity and Iranian nationalism. Later in 1953 a joint American and British coup toppled Mossadegh, returned the Shah to power, and restored oilfields to Britain, but henceforth other countries, too. Yett the coup sowed the seeds of a lasting mistrust.</ref> \"[T]he plot to overthrow Mossadegh and give the oilfields back to the AIOC was in the hands of a British diplomat called Robin Zaehner, later professor of Eastern religions at Oxford.\"<ref>[[Robert Fisk]], [http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article4588.htm \"Another Fine Mess\"], Information Clearing House (2003). \"It was Zaehner who had cultivated the Rashidian brothers, each of whom had worked against German influence in Iran during the Second World War.\" They were key players in the 1951 coup attempt. Fisk knew Robin Zaehner, \"the British classics scholar who helped mastermind it.\"</ref><ref>During the 1951 attempted overthrow, Zaehner is said to have enlisted support of politicians, editors, aristocrats, army officers, tribal chiefs, businessmen, and others, including several associates of Mossadegh.

A century of struggle against authoritarian rule'' (Harvard University 2008), p. 153. \"The defeat of [Mossadegh's civic-nationalist] movement was a watershed that marked renewed antagonism between the rulers and the ruled, as well as intensified abhorrence of Western imperialism.\"</ref><ref>de Bellaigue, ''Patriot of Persia'' (2012), pp. 271-278.</ref><ref>Cereti (1957), \u00b6\u00b617-20.</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, [[MI5]] [[counterintelligence]] officer [[Peter Wright (MI5 officer)|Peter Wright]] questioned Zaehner about floating allegations that he had doubled as a spy for the [[Soviet Union]], harming British intelligence operations in [[Operation Ajax|Iran]] and [[History of Communist Albania#Deteriorating relations with the West|Albania]] during the [[The Cold War#Europe|period]] following [[World War II#Axis collapse, Allied victory|World War II]]. Zaehner is described as \"a small, wiry-looking man, clothed in the distracted charm of erudition.\" In his 1987 book ''[[Spycatcher]]'' Wright wrote that Zaehner's humble demeanor and candid denial convinced him that the [[Oxford don]] had remained loyal to Britain. Wright notes that \"I felt like a heel\" for confronting Zaehner.<ref>[[Peter Wright (MI5 officer)|Peter Wright]], ''Spycatcher'' (1987) at 245\u2013246. Wright states that, \"I felt bitter at the ease with which the accusation had been made,\" and for his subjecting a loyal colleague to hearing the false charges made against him. \"In that moment the civilized cradle of Oxford disintegrated around him; he was back behind the lines again, surrounded by enemies, alone and double-crossed\" (p. 246 quote).</ref>\n\nAlthough in the intelligence service for the benefit of his Government, on later reflection Zaehner did not understand the utilitarian activities he performed as being altogether ennobling. In such \"Government service abroad\", he wrote, \"truth is seen as the last of the virtues and to lie comes to be a second nature. It was, then, with relief that I returned to academic life because, it seemed to me, if ever there was a profession concerned with a single-minded search for truth, it was the profession of the scholar.\"<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970), p. 6 (quote).</ref><ref>de Bellaigue, ''Patriot of Persia'' (2012), p. 194. The job MI6 gave to Zaehner in Tehran was \"ugly: to sow chaos in the heart of a sovereign government.\"</ref> Prof. [[Jeffrey Kripal]] discusses \"Zaehner's extraordinary truth telling\" which may appear \"politically incorrect\". The \"too truthful professor\" might be seen as \"a redemptive or compensatory act\" for \"his earlier career in dissimulation and deception\" as a spy.<ref>Jeffrey Kripal, ''Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom'' (2001), p. 162.

Returning to [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] several years after the war, he continued work on his ''Zurvan'' book,<ref>Zaehner, ''Zurvan, a Zoroastrian dilemma'' (1955).</ref> and lectured in Persian literature. His reputation then \"rested on articles on Zoroastrianism, mainly [[philological]]\" written before the war.<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970), p. 8.</ref>\n\nIn 1952 Zaehner was elected [[Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics]] to succeed the celebrated professor [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], who had resigned to become Vice-President (later [[Presidents of India|President]]) of India.<ref>[[Sarvepalli Gopal]], ''Radhakrishnan. A Biography'' (Delhi: Oxford University Press 1989), pp. 249\u2013250, 257 (VP); 304\u2013307 (P); during his last three years at Oxford, Radhakrishnan had served concurrently as India's ambassador to the Soviet Union (pp. 213\u2013215, 228, 248, 257). He was the first Spalding professor, starting in 1936 (pp. 132\u2013133, 145).</ref><ref>[[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|S. Radhakrishnan]], ''Eastern Religions and Western Thought'' (Oxford University 1939, 2d ed. 1940; 1960), p. 20. Regarding his Spalding post: \"the unprecedented appointment of an Asian to the Oxford Chair [is] motivated, I take it, by a desire to lift Eastern Thought... [indicating] its enduring value as a living force in shaping the soul of the modern man.\"</ref><ref>Vishwanath S. Naravane, ''Modern Indian Thought'' (New Delhi: Orient Longman 1978), p. 249. Radhakrishnan's \"role has been described as that of a 'liaison officer' between East and West... as a 'philosophical bilinguist'... as a bridge builder facilitating intellectual commerce... .\"</ref> Zaehner had applied for this position. Radhakrishnan previously had been advancing a harmonizing viewpoint with regard to the study of [[comparative religions]], and the academic Chair had a subtext of being \"founded to propagate a kind of universalism\". Zaehner's inaugural lecture was unconventional in content. He delivered a strong yet witty criticism of \"universalism\" in religion.<ref>Zaehner's 1953 Spalding lecture, \"Foolishness to the Greeks\", was incorporated as an Appendix, pp. 428\u2013443, in his book ''Concordant Discord'' (1970).</ref>\n\nIt drew controversy. Prof. [[Michael Dummett]] opines that what concerned Zaehner was \"to make it clear from the start of his tenure of the Chair that he was nobody else's man.\"<ref>Michael Dummett, \"Introduction\" (1981) to Zaehner's posthumous ''The City within the Heart'', at pp. xii-xiii, p. xii (quotes).</ref><ref>Cf. Gopal, ''Radhakrishnan'' (1989). During the last decades of the [[Indian independence movement]], Prof. Radhakrishnan had criticized Christianity's unique claims (pp. 39\u201344, 195\u2013197). He promoted an optimistic view of \"a shrinking world\" in which his generation would provide \"spiritual oneness and create an integrated human community\" (p. 149 quote). His ''Eastern Religions and Western Thought'' (Oxford 1939) discussed, e.g., Hindu influence on the ancient Greeks, and \"common elements in Christianity and Hinduiism\" (pp. 159\u2013160).</ref> Zaehner continued an interest in Zoroastrian studies, publishing his ''Zurvan'' book and two others on the subject during the 1950s.<ref>See Zoroastrian sections below.</ref>\n\nSince 1952, however, he had turned his primary attention further East. \"After my election to the Spalding Chair, I decided to devote myself mainly to the study of Indian religions in accordance with the founder's wishes.\"<ref>Zaehner, ''Zurvan'' (reissued 1972) \"Preface to the New Printing\", pp. v (quote) and vi (Hinduism and Buddhism).</ref> He served Oxford in this academic chair, while also a fellow at [[All Souls College]], until his death in 1974, and never married.<ref>Alana Howard, \"Gifford Lecture ''Biography''.\"</ref><ref>Cf. Kripal, ''Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom'' (2001), p. 189.</ref>\n\nIn his influential 1957 book ''Mysticism Sacred and Profane'', Zaehner discussed this traditional, cross-cultural spiritual practice. Based on mystical writings, he offered an innovative typology that became widely discussed in academic journals. He also analyzed claims that [[mescalin]] use fit into this spiritual quest. His conclusion was near dismissive. Yet he revisited his harsh words on the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of drug mysticism in his 1972 book ''Zen, Drug and Mysticism''. His warnings became somewhat qualified by some prudent suggestions. He carefully distinguished between drug-induced states and religious mysticism. Then the [[BBC]] began asking him to talk on the radio, where he acquired a following. He was invited abroad to lecture.<ref>Fernandes, ''The Hindu mystical experience'' (2004), p.6 (BBC talks, lectures abroad), pp. 10\u201311 (writing on drug mysticism).</ref><ref>See Popular & drug culture section below.</ref>\n\nHis delivery in Scotland of the [[Gifford Lectures]] led him to write perhaps his most magisterial book. Zaehner traveled twice to the [[University of St. Andrews]] during the years 1967 to 1969. The subject he choose concerned the convoluted and intertwined history of the different world religions during the long duration of their mutual co-existence. He described the interactions as both fiercely contested and relatively cross-cultivating, in contrast to other periods of a more sovereign isolation. The lectures were later published in 1970 \"just four years before his death\" by Oxford University as ''Concordant Discord. The interdependence of faiths''.<ref>Kripal, ''Roads of Excess, Palaces of Wisdom'' (2001), p. 181 (quote).</ref><ref>See Gifford Lecture section below.</ref>\n\n====Peer descriptions====\nAs professor Zaehner \"had a great facility for writing, and an enormous appetite for work. [He also] had a talent for friendship, a deep affection for a number of particular close friends and an appreciation of human personality, especially for anything bizarre or eccentric\". Nonetheless. \"he passed a great deal of his time alone, most of it in his study working.\"<ref>Dummett, \"Introduction\" (1981), pp. xiii-xiv (quote).</ref>\n\nAn American professor described Zaehner in a different light: \"The small, birdlike Zaehner, whose rheumy, color-faded eyes darted about in a clay colored face, misted blue from the smoke of [[Gauloises]] cigarettes, could be fearsome indeed. He was a volatile figure, worthy of the best steel of his age.\"<ref>Newell, ''Struggle and Submission. R. C. Zaehner on mysticisms'' (1981), p. iv (quote).</ref>\n\nHis colleague in Iran, Prof. [[Ann K. S. Lambton]] of [[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]], recalled, \"He did not, perhaps, suffer fools gladly, but for the serious student he would take immense pains\". Prof. Zaehner was \"an entertaining companion\" with \"many wildly funny\" stories, \"a man of great originality, not to say eccentricity.\"<ref>Lambton, \"Obituary\" (1975), p. 624 (quote).</ref>\n\n\"Zaehner was a scholar who turned into something different, something more important than a scholar,\" according to [[Michael Dummett]], a professor of philosophy at Oxford, who wanted to call him a \"penseur\" [French: a thinker]. With insight and learning (and his war-time experience) Zaehner shed light on key issues in contemporary spiritual life, writing abundantly. \"His talent lay in seeing what to ask, rather than in how to answer... .\"<ref>Dummett, \"Introduction\" (1981) at xi (quotes). Prof. Dummett here may refer especially to Zaehner's later, more popularizing books, e.g., on those counterculture drug users who associated their experience with mysticism. Yet Zaehner's work shed light on many regions.</ref>\n\nAbout Zaehner's writing style, [[Wilfred Cantwell Smith]] compared it to a merry-go-round, so that the reader is not sure he is \"actually going somewhere. A merry-go-round of such engaging colour, boisterous sound effects, and bouncing intellectual activity, however, is itself perhaps no mean achievement.\"<ref>Smith, \"Review of ''Concordant Discord'', in ''The Journal of Religion'', v.53 (1973), p.381; in Newell (1981), p.iii.</ref>\n\nIn theology he challenged the ecumenical trend that strove to somehow see a uniformity in all religions. He acted not out of an ill will, but from a conviction that any fruitful dialogue between religions must be based on a \"pursuit of truth\". If such profound dialogue rested on a false or a superficial \"harmony and friendship\" it would only foster hidden misunderstandings, Zaehner thought, which would ultimately result in a deepening mistrust.<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970), pp. 6 & 7 (quotes).</ref><ref>[[Gregory Baum]], \"Foreword\" to Newell (1981), p. xi.</ref>\n\n==His writings==\n\n===Zoroastrian studies===\n\n====''Zurvan''====\nInitially Zaehner's reputation rested on his studies of [[Zoroastrianism]], at first articles mostly on [[philology]] in academic journals. He labored for many years on a scholarly work, his ''[[Zurvan]], a Zoroastrian dilemma'' (1955). This book provides an original discussions of an influential [[theology|theological]] deviation from the Zoroastrian orthodoxy of ancient Persia's [[Achaemenid Empire]], which was a stark, ethical [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]]. Zurvanism was promoted by the [[Sasanian Empire]] (224\u2013651) which arose later during Roman times. Until the Muslim conquest, Zurvanism in the Persian world became established and disestablished by turns.<ref>Zaehner, ''Zurvan'' (1955, 1972). The oldest reference for Zurvan found dates to the 12th (name), and 4th (sources unclear) centuries BCE (p. 20). Zurvanism had been installed at start of Sasanid rule as its state religion (p. 90), yet its status varied (pp. 112\u2013113).</ref><ref>Touraj Daryaee, ''Sasanian Iran 224\u2013651 CE'' (Mazda Publishers, Costa Mesa 2008), King [[Ardashir I|Ardaxsir I]] founded Sananid rule as Zoroastrian, with labors by the priest Kerdir (p, 16); Zurvan in edict (p. 62).</ref><ref>Zaehner differs with [[Mary Boyce]] as to whether, during the prior [[Parthia]]n period (247 BCE to 224 CE) in Iran, Zoroastrianism survived if not flourished, or was little practiced, confused and inauthentic. Zaehner chose the latter (the Sasanians \"restored the Zoroastrian faith\"). Compare: her ''Zoroastrians. Their Religious Beliefs and Practices'' (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul 1979, 1985), pp. 80\u201382; and, his ''Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism'' (1961), pp. at 22 (quote), 175.</ref>\n\nZurvan was an innovation analogous to Zoroastrian original doctrine. The prophet [[Zoroaster]] preached that the benevolent ''[[Ahura Mazda]]'' (the \"Wise Lord\"), as the creator God, fashioned both ''[[Spenta Mainyu]]'' (the Holy Spirit), and ''[[Angra Mainyu]]'' (the Aggressive Spirit) who chose to turn evil. These two created Spirits were called twins, one good, one evil. Over the centuries ''Ahura Mazda'' and his \"messenger\" the good ''Spenta Mainyu'' became conflated and identified; hence, the creator ''Ahura Mazda'' began to be seen as the twin of the evil ''Angra Mainyu''. It was in this guise that Zoroastrianism became the state religion in Achaemenid Persia. Without fully abandoning dualism, some started to consider ''Zurvan'' (Time) as the underlying cause of both the benevolent ''Ahura Mazda'' and the evil ''Angra Mainyu''. The picture is complicated by very different schools of Zurvanism, and contesting Zoroastrian sects. Also, ''Ahura Mazda'' was later known as ''[[Ohrmazd]]'', and ''Angra Mainyu'' became ''[[Ahriman]]''.<ref>Zaehner, ''Zurvan'' (1955, 1972), pp. 3\u20135 (dualism of Zoroaster, and development of Zurvan).</ref><ref>Zaehner, ''Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism'' (1961) at 34, 42\u201346 (Zoroaster's teaching); 178\u2013183 , 246\u2013247 (Zoroastrian sects).</ref><ref>Mary Boyce, ''Zoroastrians.

With Time as 'father' twins came into being: the ethical, bountiful ''Ohrmazd'', who was worshipped, and his satanic antagonist ''Ahriman'', against whom believers fought. As Infinite Time, Zurvan rose supreme \"above Ohrmazd and Ahriman\" and stood \"above good and evil\". This aggravated the traditional 'orthodox' Zoroastrians (the Mazdean ethical dualists).<ref>Zaehner, ''Zurvan.

During the 12,000 year period of finite Time (Zurvan being both kinds of Time), human history occurs, the fight against Ahriman starts, and the final victory of ''Ohrmazd'' is achieved. Yet throughout, orthodox Mazdeans insisted, it is Ohrmazd who remains supreme, not Zurvan. On the other hand, his adherents held that Zurvan was God of Time, Space, Wisdom, and Power, and the Lord of Death, of Order, and of Fate.<ref>Zaehner, ''Zurvan'' (1955, 1972), finite Time, victory of Ohrmazd (pp. 106\u2013107 quote, and 100\u2013101); Zurvan as God (p. 219), as Lord (pp. 239, 248, 254).</ref>\n\n====''Teachings of the Magi''====\n''The Teachings of the Magi'' (1956)<ref>A short (156 pages) book published by George Allen and Unwin for a series, Classics East and West.</ref> was Zaehner's second of three book on Zoroastrianism. It presented the \"main tenets\" of the religion in the Sasanid era, during the reign of [[Shapur II]], a 4th-century King. Its chief sources were [[Pahlavi literature|Pahlavi books]] written a few centuries later by Zoroastrians. Each of its ten chapters contains Zaehner's descriptive commentaries, illustrated by his translations from historic texts. Chapter IV, \"The Necessity of Dualism\" is typical, half being the author's narrative and half extracts from a Pahlavi work, here the [[Shikand-gumanic Vichar|Shikand Gumani Vazar]] by Mardan Farrukh.<ref>Zaehner (1956), Chapter IV, pp. 52\u201366. The \"main tenants\" quote at p. 11.</ref>\n\n====''Dawn and Twilight''====\nIn his ''The Dawn and Twilight of Zoroastrianism'' (1961), Zaehner adopted a chronological dichotomy.  He first explores origins, the founding of the religion by its prophet Zoroaster. He notes that the [[Gathas]], the earliest texts in the [[Avesta]], make it obvious that \"Zoroaster met with very stiff opposition from the civil and ecclesiastical authorities when once he had proclaimed his mission.\" \"His enemies... supported the ancient national religion.\" On moral and ecological grounds, Zoroaster favored the \"settled [[pastoral]] and agricultural community\" as against the \"predatory, marauding tribal societies\". His theological and ethical dualism advocated for \"the followers of Truth the life-conserving and life-enhancing forces\" and against the \"destructive forces\" of the Lie.<ref>Zaehner, ''Dawn and Twilight'' (1961), p. 25 (''Gathas''); p. 35 (quote \"opposition\"), p. 37 (quote \"enemies\"); p. 40 (quotes \"settled\", \"marauding\"); p. 42 (quote \"Truth\" and \"Lie\").</ref> For the dates of the prophet's life, Zaehner adopted the traditional 6th century BCE dates.<ref>Zaehner, ''Dawn and Twilight'' (1961), p. 33 (dates [of Sasanian priests] were pegged to year of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s conquests).</ref><ref>Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin, ''La religion de l'Iran ancient'' (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France 1962) translated as ''Religion of Ancient Iran'' (Bombay: Tata 1973), pp. 99\u2013100. Classic Greeks assigned his dates to 6000 years before Plato. The \"native tradition\" of the 7th century CE placed him 258 years before Alexander (early 6th century BC). The author here concludes 600 BC at the latest (concurrent with Buddha and Confucius), but perhaps 1000 BC per \"linguistic evidence\".</ref><ref>Josef Wieseh\u00f6fer, ''Ancient Persia'' (London: I.

Brill 1975) at 190. Boyce notes that the 6th-century dates were suggested by Sasanian priests, but are known to be artificial. She favors an earlier dating, 1400 to 1000 BC, for the prophet Zarathushtra or Zoroaster. His ''Gathas'' are linguistically comparable to the [[Rig Veda]], dated at 1700 BC, and the pastoral social economy described in the ''Gathas'' fits that time period.</ref><ref>Mehr, ''The Zoroastrian Tradition'' (1991), pp. 3\u20135. Mehr's discussion gives a date of 1750 BC for Zoroaster, stating reasons similar to those of Boyce.</ref>\n\n[[Zoroaster]] reformed the old [[polytheistic]] religion by making Ahura Mazdah [the Wise Lord] the Creator, the only God. An innovation by Zoroaster was the ''abstract notions'', namely, the Holy Spirit, and the [[Amesha Spentas]] (Good Mind, Truth, Devotion, Dominion, Wholeness, Immortality). Zaehner interpreted them '''not''' as new substitutes for the excluded old gods, \"but as part of the divine personality itself\" which may also serve \"as mediating functions between God and man\". The ''Amesha Spentas'' are \"aspects of God, but aspects in which man too can share.\"<ref>Zaehner, ''Dawn and Twilight'' (1961), pp. 54-55 (Ahura Mazdah); 45-46 (\"mediating\" quote), 71 (\"aspects\" quote).</ref> Angra Mainyu was the dualistic evil.<ref>See above: ''Zurvan'' section.</ref> Dating to [[Proto-Indo-Iranian religion|before the final parting]] of ways of the [[Indo-Iranians]], the [[Hindu]]s had two classes of gods, the ''[[asura]]s'' (e.g., [[Varuna]]) and the ''[[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]]'' (e.g., [[Indra]]). Later following the invasion of India the ''asuras'' sank to the rank of demon. ''Au contraire'', in Iran the ''[[ahura]]s'' were favored, while the ''[[daeva]]s'' fell and opposed truth, spurred in part by Zoroaster's reform. In the old Iranian religion, an ''ahura'' [lord] was concerned with \"the right ordering of the cosmos\".<ref>Zaehner, ''Dawn and Twilight'' (1961), pp. 37 (Varuna as ''asura'', Indra as ''deva''), 39 (''asuras'' lawful), 66 (Ahura Mazdah and Vouruna), 82-83 (laws of Zoroaster, ''asura''), 132 (''Rig Veda'', ''Avesta'').

The period between the ''Dawn'' and the ''Twilight'' was not uneventful. Scholars often differ over conflicting theories of Zoroaster's original message by turns compromised and transformed, a schism that split the religion, survivals of the preexisting [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]], rise of [[Mithraism]], and political opportunism. Also (pp. 134-135): the confusion added by a \"loss of historic memory\" during the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] era, a regional commingling of oral history and heroic tales.</ref> There arose the teachings about ''Zurvan i Akanarak'' [Infinite Time]. The Sasanid state's ideological rationale was sourced in Zoroastrian cosmology and sense of virtue. The ''[[Amesha Spenta]]s'' provided spiritual support for human activities according to an articulated [[mean]] (e.g., \"the just equipoise between excess and deficiency\", Zoroastrian \"law\", and \"wisdom or reason\"). As an ethical principle the ''mean'' followed the contours of the 'treaty' between [[Ohrmazd]] [Ahura Mazda] and [[Ahriman]] [Angra Mainyu], which governed their struggle in Finite Time. Other doctrines came into prominence, such as those about the future saviour [[Saoshyans]] (Zoroaster himself or his posthumous son). Then after the final triumph of the Good Religion the wise lord ''Orhmazd'' \"elevates the whole material creation into the spiritual order, and there the perfection that each created thing has as it issues from the hand of God is restored to it\" in the ''Frashkart'' or \"Making Excellent\".<ref>Zaehner, ''Dawn and Twilight'' (1961), pp. 181\u2013184, 193\u2013247 (Zurvan); pp. 284\u2013301 (Sassanid state: the mean at 285, 286 & 289, 287: quotes; the treaty at 286\u2013287, castes at 284\u2013285); pp. 58\u201360, 299, 317-318 (Saoshyans); pp. 228\u2013229 quote, 296, 302 (the Frashkart).</ref><ref>Cf.

The article \"Zoroastrianism\" was included in a double-columned book he edited, ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Living Faiths'', first published in 1959.<ref>1959 article at pp. 209-222,</ref> Also were his several articles on the persistence in popular culture of the former national religion, \"Zoroastrian survivals in Iranian folklore\".<ref>The two related articles (1952, 1965), and its posthumous \"Part II\" (1992).</ref> Chapters, in whole or part, on Zoroastrianism appeared in a few of his other books: ''At Sundry Times'' (1958), aka ''The Comparison of Religions'' (1962);<ref>Chapter IV, \"Prophets outside Israel\" pp. 134\u2013164, Zoroaster discussion at pp. 135\u2013153 (1962).</ref> ''The Convergent Spirit'', aka ''Matter and Spirit'' (1963);<ref>Chapter 5, \"Solidarity in God,\" pp. 130-156 (1963).</ref> and ''Concordant Discord'' (1970).<ref>Chapter XIX, \"Beneath the Sun of Satan\" pp. 385\u2013403, at pp. 387\u2013394 (1970).</ref>\n\n===Comparative religion===\nIn addition to the two titles below, other works of Zaehner are comparative or have a significant comparative element.<ref>See Zaehner Bibliography. Zaehner, editor: ''Encyclopedia of the World's Religions'' (1959, 1988).</ref> Among these are: ''Concordant Discord'' (1970),<ref>The Giford lecture discussed below.</ref> and ''Our Savage God'' (1974).<ref>Discussed in subsection \"'New Age' drug culture\".</ref>\n\n====Choice of perspective====\nIn the west the academic field of comparative religion at its origins inherited an '[[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]]' ideal of an objective, value-neutral rationalism. Yet traditional Christian and Jewish writings provided much of the source material, as did classical literature, these being eventually joined by non-western religious texts, then empirical ethnological studies.<ref>Zaehner, ''Foolishness to the Greeks'' (1953; 1970).</ref><ref>Academic study itself split into several diverse directions: hybrid sociological and anthropological works, rational and innovative harmonizations of traditional anomalies, updated apologetics, ethical discourse.</ref> The privileged 'enlightenment' orientation in practice fell short of being value-neutral, and itself became progressively contested.<ref>Secular rationalism of the Enlightenment inherited or developed conflicting, shifting stands, e.g., [[Aristotle]]'s prime mover, [[Descarte]]'s radical doubt, [[Spinoza]]'s pantheism, [[David Hume|Hume]]'s natural religion, [[Kant]]'s rational critiques, [[Hegel]]'s historicism, [[Kierkegaard]]'s existentialism, [[Nietzsche]]'s irrationalism, [[Freud]]'s psychology (or [[Jung]]'s), [[Max Weber|Weber]]'s sociology (or [[Durkheim]]'s), etc.</ref> As to value-neutral, Zaehner situated himself roughly as follows:\n \n<blockquote>\"Any man with any convictions at all is liable to be influenced by them even when he tries to adopt an entirely objective approach; but let him recognize this from the outset and guard against it. If he does this, he will at least be less liable to deceive himself and others.\" \"Of the books I have written some are intended to be objective; others, quite frankly, are not.\" \"In all my writings on comparative religion my aim has been increasingly to show that there is a coherent pattern in religious history. For me the centre of coherence can only be Christ.\" Yet \"I have rejected as irrelevant to my theme almost everything that would find a natural place in a theological seminary, that is, [[Christian theology]], modern theology in particular.\" \"For what, then, do I have sympathy, you may well ask. Quite simply, for the 'great religions' both of East and West, expressed... in those texts that each religion holds most sacred and in the impact that these have caused.\"<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970), quotes: p.10 (\"Any man\"), p.9 (\"Of the books\"), p.16 (\"In all\"), p. 17-18 (\"I have\"), p.19 (\"For what\"). Cf. his criitique of a plague of theology, pp. 15-16.</ref><ref>Cf., Zaehner, ''Comparison'' (1958, 1962), pp. 12-13: rational agnostics before the \"basically irrational\" nature of religion seem unable.</ref><ref>Cf., Fernandes (2004), pp. 8, 12-16, 198-200.</ref></blockquote>\n \t\t \t\nAccordingly, for his primary orientation Zaehner chose from among the active participants: Christianity in its Catholic manifestation. Yet the academic Zaehner also employed a type of comparative analysis, e.g., often drawing on Zoroastrian or Hindu, or Jewish or Islamic views for contrast, for insight. Often he combined comparison with a default 'modernist' critique, which included psychology or cultural evolution.<ref>Zaehner, ''Christianity and other Religions'' (1964).</ref><ref>Kripal (2001), pp. 156-157.</ref> Zaehner's later works are informed by [[Vatican II]] (1962-1965) and tempered by [[Nostra aetate]].<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970),  pp. 12-15, esp. p.15 re his limits on ''Nostra Aetate''.</ref>\n \t\n====''At Sundry Times''====\n\nIn his 1958 book ''At Sundry Times. An essay in the comparison of religions'',<ref>Reissued by Beacon Press, Boston, in 1962, as ''The Comparison of Religions''. Page references here are to this 1962 edition. The ''At Sundry Times'' title is from [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]], chap. I, verse 1 (p.28). Based on lectures at [[University College of Wales]], which required relevance to Christianity. An appendix (195-217) is added (pp. 9, 10, 195).</ref> Zaehner came to grips with \"the problem of how a Christian should regard the non-Christian religions and how, if at all, he could correlate them into his own\" (p.&nbsp;9 [Preface]). It includes an Introduction (1), followed by chapters on Hinduism (2), on Hinduism and Buddhism (3), on \"Prophets outside Israel\", i.e., Zoroastrianism and Islam (4), and it concludes with Appendix which compares and contrasts the \"Quran and Christ\". Perhaps the key chapter is \"Consummatum Est\" (5), which \"shows, or tries to show, how the main trend in [mystical] Hinduism and Buddhism on the one hand and of [the prophetic] Zoroastrianism on the other meet and complete each other in the Christian revelation\" (Preface, p.&nbsp;9, words in brackets added).\n\t\nThe book opens with a lucid statement of his own contested hermeneutic: \"with comparative religion,\" he says, \"the question is who's to be master, that's all\" (p.&nbsp;9).<ref>This concludes a conversation between [[Humpty-Dumpty]] and [[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice]], at page 11 in the Beacon edition.</ref> He starts by saluting [[E. O. James]]. Next Zaehner mentions [[Rudolph Otto]] (1869-1937) and [[al-Ghazali]] (1058-1111) as both being skeptics about any 'reasonable' writer with no religious experience who expounds on the subject. Here Zaehner acknowledges that many Christians may only be familiar with their own type of religion (similar to Judaism and Islam), and hence be ill-equipped to adequately comprehend Hindu or Buddhist mysticism (pp.&nbsp;12\u201315).\n\nZaehner then compared the [[Old Testament]] and the [[Buddha]], the former being a history of God's commandments delivered by his prophets to the Jewish people and their struggle to live accordingly, and the later being a teacher of a path derived from his own experience, which leads to a spiritual enlightenment without God and apart from historical events (pp.&nbsp;15\u201319, 24-26). Needed is a way to bridge this gap between these two (pp.&nbsp;15, 19, 26, 28). The gap is further illustrated as it relates to desire and suffering (p.&nbsp;21), body and soul (pp.&nbsp;22\u201323), personality and death (pp.&nbsp;23\u201324). He announced a 'method' special to the book: \"I shall concern myself with what sincere men have believed\" (p.&nbsp;29).\n\n====''Christianity & other Religions''====\nThe 1964 book,<ref>New York, Hawthorn; concurrently published in London by Burns and Oates as ''The Catholic Church and World Religions''.</ref> following its introduction, has four parts: India, China and Japan, Islam, and The Catholic Church. Throughout Zaehner offers connections between the self-understanding of 'other religions' and that of the Judeo-Christian, e.g., the [[Upanishads]] and [[Thomas Merton]] (pp.&nbsp;25\u201326), [[Taoism]] and [[Adam]] (p.&nbsp;68), [[Sunyata]] and [[Plato]] (p.&nbsp;96), [[Al-Ghazali]] and [[St. Paul]] (p.&nbsp;119-120), [[Samkhya]] and [[Martin Buber]] (pp.&nbsp;131\u2013132).\n\nIn the introduction, Zaehner laments the \"very checkered history\" of the Church. Yet he expresses his admiration of [[John XXIII|Pope John]] (1881-1963), who advanced the dignity that all humanity possesses \"in the sight of God\". Zaehner then presents a brief history of Christianity in world context. The Church \"rejoiced to build into herself whatever in Paganism she found compatible\" with the revelation and ministry of Jesus. Her confidence was inferred in the words of [[Gamaliel]] (pp.&nbsp;7\u20139).<ref>Zaehner, ''Christianity'' (1964), p.9: The Jewish teacher Gamaliel stated that nothing will stop Christianity \"if it be of God\".</ref> While Europe has known of Jesus for twenty centuries, 'further' Asia has only for three. Jesus, however, seemed to have arrived there with conquerors from across the sea, and \"not as the suffering servant\" (p.&nbsp;9).<ref>Matthew 4,&nbsp;8-10 is quoted by Zaehner, ''Christianity'' (1964), p.9, regarding the temptation of Jesus in the desert, by Satan who promised him all the kingdoms of the world.</ref> As to the ancient traditions of Asia, Christians did \"condemn outright what [they had] not first learnt to understand\" (pp.&nbsp;11, 13). Zaehner thus sets the stage for a modern review of ancient traditions.\n\n\"The Catholic Church\" chapter starts by celebrating its inclusiveness. Zaehner quotes [[John Henry Newman|Cardinal Newman]] praising the early Church's absorption of [[classical antiquity|classical Mediterranean]] virtues (a source some term 'heathen').<ref>Cf., Zaehner, ''Our Savage God'' (1974), where Heraclitus, Parmenides, Plato, and Aristotle are extensively discussed.</ref> For \"from the beginning the Moral Governor of the world has scattered the seeds of truth far and wide... .\"<ref>Zaehner, ''Christianity'' (1964), p.128 (term 'heathen'; Newman quote).</ref> There may be some danger for Christians to study the spiritual truths of other religions, but it is found in scripture.<ref>[[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 17:26-28, ([[St. Paul]] at the [[Areopagus]] in Athens). Zaehner (1964) then artfully quotes St. Paul's words to the philosophers (pp. 128-129).</ref>\n\nZaehner counsels that the reader not \"neglect the witness\" of Hinduism and Buddhism, as they teach inner truths which, among Christians, have withered and faded since the one-sided [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The Church perpetually struggles to keep to a \"perfect yet precarious balance between the transcendent... Judge and King and the indwelling Christ\". Writing in 1964, Zaehner perceived \"a change for the better\" in the increasing acceptance of the \"Yogin in India or Zen in Japan\". Nonetheless, a danger exists for the 'unwary soul' who in exploring other religions may pass beyond the fear of God. Then one may enter the subtleties of mystical experience, and \"mistake his own soul for God.\" Such an error in distinguishing between ''timeless states'' can lead to ego inflation, spiritual vanity, and barrenness.<ref>Zaehner, ''Christianity'' (1964), quotes: first 129, three at 130, last 131. Zaehner further discusses the 'mystic mistake' at pp. .</ref><ref>Fernandes (2004), p.89 (spiritual pride may lead to barrenness).</ref><ref>Cf. [[Miguel Asin Palacios|Asin Palacios]], ''St. John of the Cross and Islam'' (1981), pp. 11-14, 25: renunciation of 'expansion' (''bas\u1e6d'', ''anchura''); 20-22: danger of \"spiritual vanity\".</ref>\n\nZaehner offers this categorical analysis of some major religious affiliations: a) action-oriented, worldly (Judaism, Islam, Protestantism, Confucianism); b) contemplation-oriented, other-worldly (Hinduism, Theravada Buddhism, Taoism); c) in-between (Mahayana Buddhism, neo-Confucianism, the reformed Hinduism of Gandhi, the Catholic Church).<ref>Zaehner, ''Christianity'' (1964), p.22.</ref>\n\n===Mystical experience===\n[[Scholarly approaches of mysticism|Mysticism as an academic field of study]] is relatively recent, emerging from earlier works with a religious and literary accent. From reading the writings of mystics, various traditional distinctions have been further elaborated, such as its psychological nature and its social-cultural context. Discussions have also articulated its phenomenology as a personal experience versus how it has  been interpreted by the mystic or by others.<ref>Cf. Michael Stoebel, [http://religion.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199340378.001.0001/acrefore-9780199340378-e-93 \"The comparative study of mysticism\"] in the ''Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Religion'' (New York 2015). Accessed 2015-4-22.</ref> Professor Zaehner made his contributions, e.g., to its comparative analysis and its typology.\n\n====''Sacred and Profane''====\nAfter Zaehner's initial works on Zoroastrianism, ''Mysticism. Sacred and Profane'' (1957) was his first published on another subject. It followed his assumption of the [[Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics|Spalding]] chair at [[All Souls College]], Oxford. The book's conversational style delivers clarity and wisdom on a difficult subject, and along the way are found many illuminating digressions and asides.\n\nThe profane side is first addressed with regard to the use of [[mescaline]]. Zaehner himself carefully took this natural psychedelic drug. He discussed in particular [[Aldous Huxley]], especially in his popular 1954 book ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (pp.&nbsp;1\u201329, 208-226). Next, the subject of nature mystics is described and appraised, including two examples from literature: [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]] (pp.&nbsp;30\u201383). 'Madness', it is also pointed out, may sometimes result in mental states that accord with those of the mystics (p.&nbsp;84-105).\n\nA chapter \"Integration and isolation\" takes a comparative view, discussing mystics of Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam, as well as [[Carl Jung|Jung]]'s psychology. Integration is described as nature mysticism joined to the intellect, whereby reason and the unconscious nourish one another (p.&nbsp;114). Isolation refers to [[Samkhya]] mysticism, whereby the ''purusa'' (the soul) and ''prakrti'' (nature) are separated (p.&nbsp;106-128). About the Hindu mystics, Zaehner contrasts Samkhya, a dualist doctrine associated with the Yoga method, and non-dualist [[Vedanta]], a monism inspired by the ''[[Upanishads]]''. The relative merits of Monism verses Theism, and vice versa, are discussed (pp.&nbsp;153\u2013197). Near the end of his conclusion, Zaehner repeats his view that the monist and the theistic are \"distinct and mutually opposed types of mysticism\" (p.&nbsp;204).\n\n====''Hindu and Muslim''====\nHis innovative 1960 book compares the mystical literature and practice of [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s. He frames it with a theme of diversity.<ref>Zaehner, ''Hindu and Muslim Mysticism'' (1960, 1969), \"Preface\" at vii\u2013viii.</ref> On experiential foundations, Zaehner then commences to explore the spiritual treasures left to us by the mystics of the [[Santana Dharma]], and of the [[Sufi]] [[tariqa]]s. Often he offers a phenomenological description of the reported experiences, after which he interprets them in various theological terms.<ref>[[Junayd of Baghdad|Junayd]] (pp. 135-153), and [[Al-Ghazali|Ghazali]] (153\u2013175) are thereafter discussed. Zaehner (1960, 1969).</ref>\n\nFollowing [[S. N. Dasgupta|Surendranath N. Dasgupta]], Zaehner describes five different types of mysticism to be found in Indian tradition: \"the [[Yajna|sacrificial]], the [[Upanishad#Philosophy|Upanishadic]], the [[Yoga|Yogic]], the [[Four stages of enlightenment|Buddhistic]], and that of ''[[bhakti]]''.\"<ref>Zaehner, ''Hindu and Muslim Mysticism'' (1960, 1969) at 6\u201311. Zaehner credits (p.6) Dasgupta's ''Hindu Mysticism'' for the initial typology.</ref><ref>[[S. N. Dasgupta|Surendranath N. Dasgupta]], ''Hindu Mysticism'' (Chicago: Open Court 1927; republished by Frederick Unger, New York, 1959). Dasgupta gave six lectures: Sacrificial, Upanishads, Yoga, Buddhistic, Classical Devotional, and Popular Devotional. Starting in 1922, the University of Cambridge published his ''A History of Indian Philosophy'' in five volumes.</ref> Zaehner here has chosen to rely on Hindu mystics because of their relative freedom from creed or dogma. He leaves aside the first (of historic interest), and the fourth (due to contending definitions of [[nirvana]]), so that as exemplars of mystical experience he presents:\n\n*(a) the Upanishadic \"I am this All\" which can be subdivided into (i) a [[theism|theistic]] interpretation or (ii) a [[monism|monistic]];\n*(b) the Yogic \"unity\" outside space and time, either (i) of the eternal monad of the mystic's own individual soul per the ''[[Yoga Sutras]]'' of [[Patanjali]] or (ii) of [[Brahman]], the ground of the universe, per the [[advaita]] [[Vedanta]] of [[Adi Shankara|Sankara]]; and,\n*(c) the Bhakti mysticism of love, according to the commentary on the [[Bhagavad Gita]] by [[Ramanuja]].<ref>Zaehner, ''Hindu and Muslem Mysticism'' (1960, 1969) at 19, 6 & 10; (a) 7\u20139, 17; (b) 9\u201310, 13, 17; (c) 11, 14\u201316, 17\u201318. Zaehner quotes at length from [[Martin Buber]] on mystical experience, at 17\u201318.</ref>\n\nBased on the above schematic, the resulting study of the mystics of the two religions must necessarily be asymmetrical. The sufis of Islam are approached from a Hindu perspective; indeed, many of the Muslim mystics are from the subcontinent of India. Yet the study provides thoughtful appraisls and insights.\n\n====Comparative mysticism====\nIn his work on comparative religion, Zaehner directly addressed [[mysticism]], particularly in Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. He criticized the then widely-held view that in mystical experience was to be found the key to the unity of all religions. He based his contrary views on well-known texts authored by the mystics of various traditions. Zaehner, after describing their first-hand reports of experiences of extraordinary states of consciousness, presented also their traditional interpretations. The result seems to indicate a great variety of mystical experience, and clear differences in how these were understood theologically. Many experiences seems to evidence a particular world view, e.g., theisms, monisms, dualisms, pantheisms, or agnostic.<ref>E.g., Zaehner, ''Mysticism. Sacred and Profane'' (1957, 1961) at 168.</ref><ref>Cf., Dummett (1981), p. xiii.</ref>\n\nHis critique challenged the thesis of [[Richard Bucke]], developed in his 1901 book, ''[[Cosmic Consciousness]]''. Bucke describes certain lesser facilities, followed by accounts of the prized 'cosmic' state of mind.

Zaehner does not dispute that these spiritual visionaries reach a distinguishable level of awareness. Nor does he deny that by following a disciplined life sequence over time one may be led to mystical experience: withdrawal, [[Ego death|purgation]], illumination. Instead, what Zaeher suggests is a profound difference between, e.g., the pantheistic vision of a nature mystic, admittedly pleasant and wholesome, and the personal union of a theist with the Divine lover of humankind.<ref>Zaehner, ''Mysticism.

Zaehner dismisses the [[reductionism]] of Leuba, \"his thesis that mysticism can be explained in terms of pure psychology without any reference to God as a reality distinct from the soul.\"</ref><ref>[[James H. Leuba]], ''The Psychology of Religious Mysticism'' (New York: Harcourt, Brace 1925). In the Preface Leuba writes that the \"hortatory, apologetic, and romantic character\" of most literature on mysticism \"accounts for its scientific insignificance.\" While using the factual arguments of [[Sigmund Freud]], Leuba is not in total agreement with him. Later, at p.318, Leuba writes, \"For the psychologist who remains within the province of science, religious mysticism is a revelation not of God but of man.\"</ref> About the experience of unusual states of consciousness, many mystics have written using as a descriptive metaphor language associated with marriage symbolism or sexuality.<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970), p.85: sexual imagery in Christian mystics, in Hindu.</ref><ref>Zaehner, ''Zen, Drugs and Mysticism'' (1972), p.68. \"there is scarcely a form of ''religious'' mysticism... in which sexuality does not turn up.\" He mentions commentary on the biblical [[Song of Songs]]. \"Divine love and human love at their highest are both, it would seem, sexual, for sexual love surpasses even parental love\".</ref><ref>Kripal (2001), re Zaehner: pp. 181, 183 (erotic), 184-185, 187-188 (gender). According to Kripal, Zaehner \"privileges human sexuality as the ''locus classicus'' of the very highest stages of mysticism and sexual language as the most appropriate expression of these states\" (p.183).</ref><ref>E.g., Sidney Spencer, ''Mysticism in world religions'' (Penguin 1963): \"The Spiritual Marriage\" in Christianity (pp. 253-256).

Later he quotes [[Jakob Boehme]], \"I was embraced with love as a bridegroom embraces his bride\" (p.269).</ref>\n\n[[Abrahamic]] religions traditionally identify the gender of the supreme Being as male. In Islam and in Christianity, the soul of the often male [[sufi]] or mystic, following his spiritual discipline, may encounter the holy presence of the male Deity.<ref>Zaehner, ''Mysticism.

The special states of consciousness they recorded have become the subject of modern psychological studies, e.g., by the school of [[C. G. Jung]] (favored by Zaehner).<ref>Zaehner, \"Jungian depth psychology\" a subsection at pp. 403-406 in his article \"A new Buddha and a new Tao\" (1959, 1967). Zaehner often referenced Jung's [[analytic psychology]]. <blockquote>When Jung equates the \"God-image\" with the archetype of the \"self\", he is expressing in his own psychological terminology the old Hindu identification of the ''atman'', the human soul or self, with the ''Brahman'', the ground of the entire universe. Zaehner (1959, 1967), p.414 (quote).</blockquote></ref><ref>Cf., e.g., [[Jolande Jacobi]], ''The psychology of C. G. Jung'' (Zurich 1939; London 1942, Yale University 1943, 6th ed. 1962). In abstract, the ego's animating figure and also entryway to the unconscious is [[Anima and animus|contrasexual]], that is, archetypes called the feminine ''anima'' for men, and the masculine ''animus'' for women. Yet a person's center of wholeness (the goal of [[individuation]]) is their inner [[Self (Jung)|Self]], an archetype that may also be synonymous with the ''god image'' and deified.

In addition, each category is hardly pure, in that there is a great variety of overlap between them.<ref>Zaehner, Concordant Discord (1970), pp. 199-200.</ref> Furthermore, each religion appears to field contending schools of mystical thought, and often interpretations of conscious states may differ within each of the schools.<ref>Reardon (2012), pp. 170-174.</ref> When a list of the several proposed typologies made by Zaehner over the years are mustered and compared, the results are found to be \"unstable\".<ref>Fernandes (2004), p.25, cf. pp. 23-25.</ref> Accordingly, an observer might conclude that the spiritual map of possible mysticisms would present a confused jumble through which snake perplexing pathways.

''Au contraire'', a Hindu mystic following a rival school of Vedanta may understand the same tranquil, steady illumination differently (i.e., as not Samkhya's purusa). As Zaehner proposed: the same or similar mystical experience may result in very different theological interpretations.<ref>Zaehner, ''Mysticism. Sacred and Profane'' (1957). The Samkhya-yoga and the Advaita Vedanta may interpret differently what is a very similar mystical experience (pp. 146, 153, 164, 204). A major thrust of Zaehner's 1957 book is his typology, i.e., he demonstrates the actual ''variety'' of mystical experiences (of what many had assumed were the same); then he divides them into three or four categories (168,184,198). Yet, ironically, Zaehner here also shows that the same or similar experiences may be interpreted very differently, e.g., as Samkhya-yoga or as Advaita Vedanta.</ref><ref>Zaehner, ''Hindu and Muslim'' (1960), pp. 38-39 (Yoga and Vedanta compared).</ref><ref>Fernandes (2004), pp. 57-58.</ref>\n\nInstead of the isolated purusa experience of Samkhya, the Advaita Vedanta mystic might interpret it as the experience of the Self, which illuminates the mystic's direct connection to the all-inclusive entity of ''cosmic totality''.

Iyengar declares that his view of yoga leads one to experience the \"Supreme Universal Spirit\" or ''Paramatma'' (p.21), and to a conscious state of \"''Supreme Bliss''\" (p.53).

Thus, Iyengar indicates that [[Iyengar yoga|his yoga]] does not follow Samkhya (it might be a hybrid Vedanta or [[Bhakti yoga]]).</ref> Accordingly, in Zaehner's terms, such experience may be either (1) a ''dualistic'' Samkhya atheism, or (2) a ''monistic'' type of Advaita Vedanta.

Yudhishthira is the elder of five brothers of the royal [[Pandava]] family, who leads one side in the war of the ''Mahabharata''.

Yet their situations differed. Yudhishthira, although ascetic by nature, was a royal leader who had to directly face the conflicts of his society. His realm and his family suffered great misfortunes due to political conflict and war. Yet the divine [[Krishna]] evidently considered the war and the destructive duties of the warrior (the ''[[kshatriya]] dharma'') acceptable. The wealthy householder Job, a faithful servant of his Deity, suffers severe family and personal reversals, due to Divine acquiescence. Each human being, both Job and Yudhishthira, is committed to following his righteous duty, acting in conforming to his conscience.<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970): Yudhishthira and Job (pp. 178, 179, 355).

Although Yudhishthira is the King of [[Dharma]], eventually he harshly criticizes the bloody duties of a warrior (the ''[[kshatriya]] dharma''), duties imposed also on kings. Yudhishthira himself prefers the \"constant virtues\" mandated by the dharma of a [[brahmin]]. \"Krishna represents the old order,\" interprets Zaehner, where \"trickery and violence\" hold \"an honorable place\".<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970, p. 177 (quote: holy); p. 179 (quotes: defend, justify); p. 177 (Draupadi's quote about Krishna).

Draupadi attacks Krishna (pp. 177-178, 347), attacks Yudhishthira (p. 186). Yudhishthira does not attack Krishna, but becomes disgusted with \"a warrior's duty to kill,\" saying after the destructive war:\n<blockquote>\"Cursed be the ''kshatriya'' code, cursed be physical strength, cursed be violence through which we have been brought to our present pass.

These four lectures comprise his ''Evolution in Religion'' (1971). An Appendix contains his short meditation on Death (pp. 115\u2013121), given at St. Stephen's College, Delhi.</ref>\n\nAurobindo at age seven was sent to England for education, eventually studying western [[classics]] at Cambridge University. On his return to [[Bengal]] in India, he studied its [[Sanskrit literature|ancient literature]] in Sanskrit. He later became a major political orator with a spiritual dimension, a [[Political history of Sri Aurobindo|prominent leader]] for Indian independence. Hence he was jailed. There in 1908 he had a religious experience. Relocating to the then French port of [[Pondicherry]], he became a [[yogin]] and was eventually recognized as a Hindu sage. Sri Aurobindo's writings reinterpret the Hindu traditions.<ref>E.g., Aurobindo, ''Essays on the Gita'' ([[Arya: A Philosophical Review|''Arya'']] 1916-1920; republished: Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, 9th ed. 1996;  reprint: Lotus Press, Wisconsin, 1995).</ref> [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], later President of India, praised him.<ref>Radhakrishnan wrote in 1950, \"Aurobindo was the greatest intellectual of our age and a major force for the life of the spirit.\" Quoted in D.

Aurobindo's teaching was a \"clear break\" from both [[Sankhya Yoga]] which \"made the sharpest distinction between Spirit and matter\" and from the Vedanta of [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] (p.10). Aurobindo retained the outlook of a political reformer and, e.g., with regard to [[Caste system in India|caste]], \"makes a clean break with traditional values\" (p. 29).</ref><ref>[[K. D. Sethna]], in his 1981 book on Zaehner and Teilard ''Spirituality of the Future'', found Zaehner well-read and in \"fine sympathy\" with Aurobindo. Yet however \"well-grounded\" his grasp was not total, e.g. Sri Aurobindo was '''not''' influenced by [[Henri Bergson]] (pp. 9-10 quotes, 29-30 Bergson). Sethna was the editor of [[Mother India (magazine)|''Mother India'']]. Cf. section \"Popular & drug cultures\" for Sethna's stronger criticism of Zaehner.</ref> According to Aurobindo, the aim of his new yoga was:\n\n<blockquote>\"[A] change in consciousness radical and complete\" of no less a jump in \"spiritual evolution\" than \"what took place when a mentalised being first appeared in a vital and material animal world.\" Regarding his new ''Integral Yoga'': \"The thing to be gained is the bringing in of a Power of Consciousness... not yet organized or active directly in earth-nature, ...but yet to be organized and made directly active.\"<ref>Sri Aurobindo, ''On Yoga'', part 2 (Pondicherry 1958), 6: pp. 105, 107\u2013108, quoted by Sethna (1981), pp. 31\u201332, [37:n2+n3].</ref><ref>Joseph Veliyathil, ''The Philosophy of Sri Aurobindo.

The Power of Consciousness is also called the divine \"descent of the 'Supermind',\" a spirit of pure consciousness. Otherwise, without such a transformation of selfish humans, Aurobindo considered any utopia impossible, and that promised by communists as a vain illusion leading to tyranny (pp. 28-29, 30-31). Zaehner analogizes the Power of Consciousness (Supermind) to Jesus as Logos (pp. 35, 38-39, 77, but cf. 31); cf., Christianity and [[Satcitananda|''sac-cid-\u0101nanda'']] [Being-Consciousness-Joy] (pp. 13, 48, 74).</ref> Adherents of Aurobindo's new [[Integral Yoga]] (''Purna Yoga'') would lead India to a spiritual awakening; they would facilitate an increasingly common soul-experience, in which each achieves a mystic union with the One. Each such ''gnosis'' would also be guided by the Power of Consciousness. In choosing to pursue the realization of such social self-understanding, India would hasten the natural evolution of humanity.<ref>Naravane, ''Modern Indian Thought'' ([1964], 1978): The process of cosmic evolution is preceded by an involution (p. 207), by which the material world is infused with consciousness by the Absolute; thereafter comes the ''creative'' evolution. Eventually humans appear and advance until the Supramental links us to pure consciousness, an Absolute: then everyone becomes transformed (pp. 204\u2013205). Aurobindo's \"aim is to combine the western and eastern theories of evolution\" (p. 208).

The state of gnosis \"is impossible without ample and close self-identification of ourselves with all existence\" (p.558). To \"learn how to be one self with all\" is key, \"without it there is no gnosis\" (p.559). Gnosis changes \"all our view and experience of our soul-life and of the world around us\" as it is \"the decisive transition in the [[Yoga]]\" (p.542). Yet we must \"remember that the gnostic level... is not the supreme plane of our consciousness but a middle or link plane\" (p.553).</ref> Hence furthering the conscious commitment everywhere, to collaborate with the hidden drive of creative evolution toward a spiritual advance, is high among the missions of Aurobindo's new 'Integral Yoga'.<ref>Sethna, ''Spirituality of the Future'' (1981), p. 267: Such human collaboration [in evolutionary time] is a spiritual quest that \"by a concentrated effort of the entire being [may] accomplish in a short time the results that, with less clear vision and less inward pressure, might take millennia.\"</ref><ref>Sri Aurobindo, ''The Future Evolution of Man.

In these sessions he revisits comparative mysticism and Bucke, focuses on Hinduism and Buddhism, Yudhishthira and later Job, discusses Taoist classics, Neo-Confucianism, and Zen. He doesn't forget Jung or Zoroaster, Marx or Teilhard. The result is a 464-page book: ''Concordant Discord. The Interdependence of Faiths''.\n\nIn the course of the discourse, he mentions occasionally a sophisticated view: how the different religions have provided a mutuality of nourishment, having almost unconsciously interpenetrated each other's beliefs. The historically obfuscated result is that neighbouring religions might develop the other's theological insights as their own, as well as employ the other's distinctions to accent, or explain, their own doctrines to themselves. Although Zaehner gives a suggestive commentary at the conjunction of living faiths, he respects that each remains distinct, unique. Zaehner allows the possibility of what he calls the convergence of faiths, or solidarity.<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970). Preface. Zaehner writes of the \"missing link\" between Zen and theism ( p. 304), and \"the Hindu bridge\" (p. 297), as pathways to convergence.</ref><ref>Newell, ''Struggle and Submission'' (1981), pp. 24-33 (convergence, solidarity). A false convergence is also possible (p. 252).</ref>\n\nRegarding the world religions Zaehner held, however, that we cannot use the occasional occurrence of an ironic [[syncretism]] among elites as a platform from which to leap to a unity within current religions. His rear-guard opinions conflicted with major academic trends then prevailing. \"In these [[ecumenical]] days it is unfashionable to emphasize the difference between religions.\" Yet Zaehner remained skeptical, at the risk of alienating those in the ecumenical movement whose longing for a festival of conciliation caused them to overlook the stubborn divergence inherent in the momentum. \"We must force nothing: we must not try to achieve a 'harmony' of religions at all costs when all we can yet see is a 'concordant discord'... . At this early stage of contact with the non-Christian religions, this surely is the most that we can hope for.\"<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970), p. 383 (\"unfashionable\" quote), p. 7 (\"force nothing\" quote).

[T]he ''Genesis'' story has to be interpreted against the background of our evolutionary origin. Once we do this, then the Fall begins to look more like an ascent than a degradation. For self-consciousness which transforms man into a ''rational'' animal is a qualitative leap in the evolutionary process... life becomes conscious of itself.<ref>Zaehner, ''Concordant Discord'' (1970), p.326 (quote). Zaeher next quotes [[Richard Maurice Bucke|Bucke]] favorably on same subject.</ref><ref>The ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' (c.600 BCE), 38, is quoted by Zaehner a few pages earlier (''Concordant Discord'' p.329), as he raised the possibility, regarding Adam's sin, that knowledge itself is evil, as it meddles with the original harmony of nature, the 'uncarved block' of the [[Taoism|Taoists]]. Cited also is the traditional Jewish view of [[Adam]]'s disobedience, p.333.</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn the multiple discussions referenced above, Zaehner is referring to the long-term [[cultural evolution]] of human societies, which happens in the wake of the billion-year biological evolution by [[natural selection]]. Of the later our bodies are heirs. Of the former our consciousness takes the lead. [[Sri Aurobindo]], the subject of another book by Zaehner, advocated a disciplined commitment of the spirit, informed by yoga, to advancing the cultural evolution of the species.<ref>Zaehner, ''Evolution in Religion'' (1971), pp. 28-31.

He further explored the similarities and the differences between drug-induced experiences and traditional mysticism. As an academic he had already published several books on such issues starting in 1957.<ref>In ''Mysticism, Sacred and Profane'' (1957), Zaehner had discussed in a scholarly fashion the [[mescalin]] experience and eastern religions.</ref><ref>With ''Hindu and Muslim Mysticism'' (1960), Zaehner further articulated his understanding of comparative mysticism.</ref><ref>Zaehner's 1970 book ''Concordant Discord'' lays out on a broad canvas issues of comparative mysticism, the ''Interpenetration of Faiths''.</ref> In the meantime, a widespread [[counterculture]] had arisen, often called [[New Age]], which included artists, rebels, and youth. Their [[psychedelic experiences]] were often self-explained spiritually, with reference to [[zen]] and [[eastern mysticism]].<ref>Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner, Richard Alport, ''[[The Psychedelic Experience]]. A manual based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead'' (New Hyde Park: University Books 1966).</ref><ref>R. E. L. Masters and Jean Houston, ''The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience'' (New York: Holt Rinehart Winston 1966), per Zaehner, ''Drugs, Mysticism'' (1972), e.g., p. 77.</ref> Consequently, Zaehner wanted to reach this \"wider public\".<ref>Zaehner, ''Zen, Drugs and Mysticism'' (1972), \"Foreword\" p.9.</ref> During the late 1960s he was \"very often invited to talk on the [[BBC]].\"<ref>Fernandes (2004), p.6 (quote). His 1972 book ''Drugs, Mysticism and Make-Believe'' [original English title] was \"an expansion of three radio broadcasts\" on BBC (p.265,n13).</ref>\n\nZaehner described various ancient quests to attain a mystical state of transcendence, of unification. Therein all contradictions and oppositions are reconciled; subject and object disappear, one passes beyond good and evil. That said, such a [[monist]] view can logically lead to excess, even to criminal acts.<ref>Zaehner, ''A City within the Heart'' (1981), pp. 34-35: mystical states, [[Neo-Vedanta]] [[non-dualism]] of the Hindus, and Zen (practiced in America); p. 36: excess, the deity Indra as a killer in the [[Kaushitaki Upanishad]], and his follower. Cf. excess in western religion, pp. 30-31.</ref> If practiced under the guidance of traditional religious teachers, no harm usually results.<ref>Zaehner, ''Zen, Drugs and Mysticism'' (1972), p. 125-127 re Zen, per Abbot Shibayama. Per [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], p. 115.</ref><ref>Abbot Zenkai Shibayama, ''A Flower does not Talk'' (Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle 1970), pp. 105-110, esp. 105-106, the \"Self before you were born\" p. 108; re Zaehner, ''ZDM'' (1972), p. 81.</ref><ref>Radhakrishnan, ''Eastern Religions and Western Thought'' (1939, 1960), pp. 102-103: \"When the Upanishad says that 'sin does not cling to a wise man any more than water clings to a lotus leaf' it does not mean that the sage may sin and yet be free, but rather that any one who is free from worldly attachments is also free from all temptation to sin.\"</ref> The potential for evil exists, however, through subtle misunderstanding or careless enthusiasm, according to Zaehner. After arriving at such a transcendent point, a troubled drug user may go wrong by feeling licensed to do anything, with no moral limit. The misuse of a mystical state and its theology eventually can lead to an horrific end.<ref>Zaehner, ''Our Savage God'' (1974), pp. 47, 288, 306 (Charles Manson's \"mysticism\").</ref><ref>Sethna, ''Spirituality of the Future'' (1981), in his Chap. 10, pp. 208-220, challenges Zaehner's criticism of \"the idea of an amoral or immoral component in Indian mysticism\" (p.210, quote). Sethna refers to Zaehner's ''Evolution in Religion'' (1971), pp. 18-20, which discusses \"a state so rudimentary that self-awareness and the moral sense have yet to arise\" (p.210, quote).</ref>\n\nZaehner warned of the misbehavior propagated by [[LSD]] advocate [[Timothy Leary]],<ref>Zaehner, ''Zen, Drugs and Mysticiam'' (1972), Leary: pp. 66-67, 69-75, 83-87.</ref><ref>Timothy Leary, ''The Politics of Ecstasy'' (1970).</ref> the earlier satanism of [[Aleister Crowley]],<ref>Zaehner, ''Our Savage God'' (1974), Crowley: pp. 40-47.</ref> and ultimately the criminal depravity of [[Charles Manson]].<ref>Zaehner, ''Our Savage God'' (1974), Manson: pp. 47-72. Zaehner tells how Manson was underprivileged, son of a teenage prostitute (p.51), an ex-convict whose maleducation trickled down from local occult sects (pp. 46, 59). His enemy was society (pp. 48-50, 55-56, 306-307). He preached to die to the world, by exhaustion, drugs and sex, to break-down the ego (pp. 60, 62, 69), in order to attain an indifference (pp. 60, 66-67, cf. 80). So broken, his followers committed horrific crimes (pp. 47, 56, 67).</ref><ref>[[Ed Sanders]] in his ''The Family'' (New York: Dutton 1972; reprint Avon 1972) describes the occult indoctrination used by Manson, and his loopy rationale of the murders. Zaehner quotes it and obtained knowledge of Manson's crimes from it. Zaehner, ''Our Savage God'' (1974), pp. 9, 45:n8, 61.</ref><ref>Zaehner, ''The City within the Heart'' (1981), chapter \"The Wickedness of Evil\" pp. 27-44, which begins with [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]], and ends with Manson (pp. 35-44).</ref> His essay \"Rot in the Clockwork Orange\" further illustrates from popular culture the possible brutal effects of such moral confusion and license.<ref>Zaehner,  ''Our Savage God'' (1974), pp. 19-73.</ref>\n\nYet Zaehner's detailed examination and review was not a witch hunt. His concluding appraisal of the LSD experience, although not without warning of its great risks and dangers, contained a limited, circumscribed allowance for use with a spiritual guide.<ref>Zaehner, ''Zen, Drugs and Mysticism'' (1972), pp. 133-134.</ref><ref>Cf. ''[[The Economist]]'', June 25, 2011, \"Acid Test. Research into hallucinogenic drugs begins to shake off decades of taboo\" p. 95; e.g., medical treatments, biotechnology.</ref><ref>Cf., Weiner, ''9 1/2 Mystics. The Kabbala today'' (1969, reprint 1971). Leary's \"suggestion that religious experiences may be achieved by drugs... is likely to remind a traditional Jew of Canaanite paganism, which used all kind of orgiastic rites, including drugs, to produce states of so-called expanded consciousness. \u00b6 Nevertheless, the question persists... \" (pp. 330-331). \"The answer might go something like this: \u00b6 Make room for the aberant... who bear within themselves those spores of creation which society needs for its own regeneration\" (p.333).</ref>\n\n=====''Drugs, Mysticism''=====\n\nAs its title indicates, the book addresses a range of contemporary issues.<ref>Zaehner, ''Drugs, Mysticism and Make-believe''. William Collins, London, 1972. Its American title: ''Zen, Drugs, and Mysticism''. Pantheon Books, New York, 1972.</ref> It was expanded from three talks he gave on [[British Broadcasting Company|BBC]] radio in 1970, which were printed in [[The Listener (magazine)|''The Listener'']] [9]. Although admittedly it repeats some material from his prior books, it is \"aimed at a wider audience\" (p.&nbsp;9).\n\nIn his appraisal of [[LSD]] the [[psychedelic drug]] and its relevance to mysticism, Zaehner discussed the drug's popular advocate [[Timothy Leary]] and his 1970 book.<ref>Leary, ''The Politics of Ecstasy'' (London: MacGibbon and Kee 1970; New York: G. P. Putnam 1970).</ref> Zaehner comments that, to the inexperienced, \"most descriptions of Zen enlightenment, and some of LSD experience would appear to be almost identical.\" What Leary calls the \"timeless energy process around you\" (pp.&nbsp;113\u2013114 quote; 70 & 112 quote). Yet Zaehner refers to [[Krishnamurti]] of India, and zen abbot [[Zenkei Shibayama]] of Japan. Apparently each describes a crucial difference between meditation and such experiences as LSD (pp.&nbsp;114\u2013116).\n\nThe celebration of sex while under its influence by Leary and also by many in the drug culture Zaehner compared to the frequent use of sexual imagery by the mystics of different religious cultures [63, 66-70]. Even though passages in Leary's book comport with the Hindu [[Upanishads]], Zaehner writes that by Leary's near deification of sexuality he \"would appear to part company\" with most nature mystics and, e.g., with St. [[Francis de Sales]], who distinguishes mystical ecstasy and sexual ecstasy (pp.&nbsp;68\u201369, 70 quote). In later discussing [[Georges Bernanos]],<ref>French novelist Georges Bernanos (1888-1948) distinguished between lust and sexual desire (prior to the [[sexual revolution]]); he was not a mystic (p.&nbsp;175).</ref> Zaehner opines that \"sex without love\" would constitute an abandonment of the virtues (pp.&nbsp;174\u2013175).\n\nZaehner discusses Carl Jung and his 1952 book ''Answer to Job'' (pp.&nbsp;163\u2013170).\n\n=====''Our Savage God''=====\n\nThe book's title is somewhat misleading.<ref>''Our Savage God. The Perverse use of Eastern Thought'' Sheed & Ward, New York, 1974.</ref> It attaches well, however, to its first chapter, \"Rot in the Clockwork Orange\", about the putative rationale of then contemporary episodes of mayhem and murder. About the [[Charles Manson|hippie psychotic fringe]], it made world headlines. Zaehner's focus is not on usual criminality but on hideous acts claiming a religious sanction, that with sinister cunning fakes the '[[new age]]' (p.&nbsp;12). The chapter's title refers to [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|the 1962 novel]] by [[Anthony Burgess]] and [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|the 1971 film]] by [[Stanley Kubrick]] (p.&nbsp;35). Portrayed therein is crazy, soul-killing violence.<ref>The novel and film are discussed in unavoidable graphic language (pp.&nbsp;19-73: 35-40, esp. 36).</ref><ref>Carlo Cereti (1976-1977). ''Our Savage God'' was \"written on the emotional wave following the murder of the actress [[Sharon Tate]] and some of her friends by members of a cult led by Charles Manson.\"</ref>\n\nYet, very differently, about his book on the whole Zaehner says its hero is [[Aristotle]]. The supporting cast is drawn from his \"philosophical milieu\" (p.&nbsp;14). The next four chapters cover: [[Heraclitus]] per a dialectical unity of opposites (pp. 92, 102);<ref>Zaehner, ''Dialectical Christianity'' (1971), p.37.</ref> [[Parmenides]] whose ''Way of Truth'' is compared to the [[Vedanta]]'s Brahman (121-122); [[Plato]] (141-160); and the [[Stagira (ancient city)|stagirite]] hero who arrives at [[Being]], akin to ''[[Satcitananda|Sat-Cit-Ananda]]'' (p.&nbsp;192). As indicated, Zaehner offers a comparison of these Ancient Greek philosophers to the Vedic wisdom of ancient India, especially the [[Mythopoeic thought|mythopoetic]] element in the ''[[Upanishads]]'' (e.g., p.&nbsp;133-138).\n\nYet this philosophical theme is somewhat misleading as well, for Zaehner intermittently interjects the ever-present and unwelcome possibility of criminality and mayhem. [[Charles Manson]] on occasion appears as the personification of the evil side of contemporary drug culture. His depraved mystical con-game provides some unappetizing food for thought.<ref>See section above \"Popular and drug culture\" re footnote about Manson's life. Also, here (e.g., pp.&nbsp;51\u201375).</ref>\n\n==Quotations==\n\n*There is indeed a sharp division between those religions whose characteristic form of religious experience is prayer and adoration of [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]]'s God of [[Abraham]], God of Isaac, God of Jacob on the one hand, and religions in which sitting postures designed to find the [[Dharmic religions|God within]] you are thought to be the most appropriate way of approaching the Deity.<ref>Zaehner, ''Our Savage God'' (1974) p. 234 (quote).</ref><ref>Cf., Zaehner, ''Comparison of Religions'' (1958, 1962), p.30: \"The prophet confronts the mystic: and each speaks a different language that is not comprehensible to the other.\"</ref>\n*[[C.

She says he marshals scripture, and evidence on the divine presence, death, and resurrection in the Haoma sacrifice, so that it resembles \"the Christian communion rite\". \"But if all the material is properly taken into consideration... its intention appears as something very different\" (p. 164).  She cites [[A. Berriedale Keith]], ''The religion and philosophy of the Veda and Upanishads, vol. II'' (Harvard Oriental Series 1925, reprint 1970), pp. 332.

He is an [[infant]] member of the same [[Yoda's species|unnamed alien species]] as the popular ''Star Wars'' character [[Yoda]], with whom he shares a strong ability with [[the Force]]. In the series, the protagonist known as \"[[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|The Mandalorian]]\" is hired to track down and capture the Child for a remnant of the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], but instead becomes his adoptive father and protects him from the Imperials.\n\nThe Child and the Mandalorian are the only characters who have appeared in every episode of the series. He was created by ''The Mandalorian'' creator and [[showrunner]] [[Jon Favreau]] based upon his desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species. The character was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive producer [[Dave Filoni]], and the character's imagery was defined by concept artist Christian Alzmann. The Child is mostly a work of [[animatronics]] and [[puppetry]], although accentuated with [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\nThe puppet was designed by [[Legacy Effects]] and cost about $5 million to make. It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions. The character's voice and sounds were created using a combination of adult and infant vocals, as well as recordings of a [[bat-eared fox]] and [[kinkajou]].  The dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of [[parenting]] and [[Father|fatherhood]] prevalent in ''The Mandalorian'', and the Child character has also raised questions about [[good and evil]] and [[nature versus nurture]] in the show.\n\nThe Child has received a positive reception from fans and reviewers, is widely considered the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]], and quickly became a popular [[Internet meme]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' called him \"2019's biggest new character\",<ref name=\"Vasquez1203\" /> and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' has said the character \"represents the future of Hollywood\".<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" /> Many writers have described the Child as a key part in the success of Disney+. The Child was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from ''The Mandalorian''{{'}}s prerelease marketing and merchandise plans to avoid leaks before the show aired. As a result, merchandise of the Child was not immediately available after the show debuted, which some analysts say cost Disney $2.7 million in revenue, but [[Bob Iger]], Disney's CEO at the time of ''The Mandalorian'''s premiere, has defended the strategy.\n\n==Appearances==\nThe Child is a member of the same alien species as the popular ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Yoda]].<ref

The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he leaves the Child with the Client,<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> and then again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nAnthony Breznican of ''Vanity Fair'' has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent\u2019s psyche like a dentist\u2019s drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"<ref name=\"Breznican1126\" /> Likewise, ''Vulture'' writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that\u2019s left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger. One example is in \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /><ref name=\"White1218\">{{cite news |last=White |first=Brett |title=Is Baby Yoda Bad to the Bone?

When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: \"you have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\".<ref name=\"Keane1207\" /> ''[[ScreenCrush]]'' writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" />\n\n===Good and evil; nature versus nurture===\nOne scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many fans to reevaluate the Child and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies. During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, the Child observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly [[arm wrestling]] match.

Miller suggested the Child could be putting on a similar performance.<ref name=\"Miller1218\" /> One fan theory suggests the Child could be related to a prophecy in a past ''Star Wars'' work that predicted an evil that could consume the galaxy. The prophecy, described in the novel ''[[Star Wars: Master and Apprentice]]'' (2019), says: \"The danger of the past is not past, but sleeps in an egg. When the egg cracks, it will threaten the galaxy entire.\" Fans theorized this could refer to the Child, who sleeps in an egg-like bassinet in ''The Mandalorian''.<ref name=\"Abdulbaki0106\" /> Others have theorized the reason the Imperial remnant wants the Child is to turn him over to the Dark Side of the Force,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /> or for use as a weapon.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> Moff Gideon in the season finale says: \"You may think you have some idea what you\u2019re in possession of, but you do not.\" Peter Foy of ''Comic Book Resources'' suggested this could allude to the Child's potential to cause mass destruction.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" />\n\nCaitlin Gallagher of ''[[Bustle (website)|Bustle]]'' suggested rather than building toward the Child becoming evil, the show could be suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find a way to raise the Child in a less violent environment.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> All season long, the Child has witnessed those around him committing violent acts.<ref name=\"Milner1222\">{{cite news |last=Milner |first=Sarah Bea |title=The Mandalorian: Baby Yoda Learns About Good & Bad In A Powerful Way |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=December 22, 2019 |url=https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |accessdate=February 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223125659/https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |archive-date=December 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> For example, ''Vulture'' writer Keith Phipps noticed that when IG-11 kills multiple stormtroopers in front of him, the Child has a \"look of wonder\" in his eyes, which Phipps said \"is hilarious, but also a little chilling\".<ref name=\"Phipps1227\" /> Some writers applied a [[nature versus nurture]] argument to this, contending the Child is becoming violent because of what he is learning based on the actions around him.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> This suggests the Child is not inherently good or evil,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /><ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> but that instead, like all children, he is impressionable and does not fully understand the events occurring around him.

He is an [[infant]] member of the same [[Yoda's species|unnamed alien species]] as the popular ''Star Wars'' character [[Yoda]], with whom he shares a strong ability with [[the Force]]. In the series, the protagonist known as \"[[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|The Mandalorian]]\" is hired to track down and capture the Child for a remnant of the fallen [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], but instead becomes his adoptive father and protects him from the Imperials.\n\nThe Child and the Mandalorian are the only characters who have appeared in every episode of the series. He was created by ''The Mandalorian'' creator and [[showrunner]] [[Jon Favreau]] based upon his desire to explore the mystery around Yoda and his species. The character was further developed in early conversations between Favreau and executive producer [[Dave Filoni]], and the character's imagery was defined by concept artist Christian Alzmann. The Child is mostly a work of [[animatronics]] and [[puppetry]], although accentuated with [[computer-generated imagery]].\n\nThe puppet was designed by [[Legacy Effects]] and cost about $5 million to make. It is controlled by two technicians, one who operates the eyes and mouth and another who controls other facial expressions. The character's voice and sounds were created using a combination of adult and infant vocals, as well as recordings of a [[bat-eared fox]] and [[kinkajou]].  The dynamic between the Mandalorian and the Child embody a theme of [[parenting]] and [[Father|fatherhood]] prevalent in ''The Mandalorian'', and the Child character has also raised questions about [[good and evil]] and [[nature versus nurture]] in the show.\n\nThe Child has received a positive reception from fans and reviewers, is widely considered the show's [[List of breakout characters|breakout character]], and quickly became a popular [[Internet meme]]. ''[[The Guardian]]'' called him \"2019's biggest new character\",<ref name=\"Vasquez1203\" /> and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' has said the character \"represents the future of Hollywood\".<ref name=\"Keegan1219\" /> Many writers have described the Child as a key part in the success of Disney+. The Child was kept secret and was deliberately withheld from ''The Mandalorian''{{'}}s prerelease marketing and merchandise plans to avoid leaks before the show aired. As a result, merchandise of the Child was not immediately available after the show debuted, which some analysts say cost Disney $2.7 million in revenue, but [[Bob Iger]], Disney's CEO at the time of ''The Mandalorian'''s premiere, has defended the strategy.\n\n==Appearances==\nThe Child is a member of the same alien species as the popular ''[[Star Wars]]'' character [[Yoda]].<ref

The Mandalorian feels a connection and parental bond with the Child because of his own childhood, when he was orphaned upon the death of his parents and was adopted by the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Nevertheless, fatherhood was not a role the Mandalorian was initially seeking, and he makes repeated initial attempts to avoid this responsibility.<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> He first does so in \"Chapter 3: The Sin\", when he leaves the Child with the Client,<ref name=\"Pereira1129\" /> and then again in \"Chapter 4\" Sanctuary\", when he plans to leave the Child with Omera, a protective mother on the planet Sorgan who is willing to take the Child into her own family.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> The Mandalorian does not fully commit to the role of fatherhood until the first season finale, \"Chapter 8: Redemption\", when the Child himself is also adopted into the Mandalorian culture as a \"foundling\" and the Mandalorian is formally declared to be his father figure.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nAnthony Breznican of ''Vanity Fair'' has noted that none of the day-to-day difficulties of parenthood are portrayed in the series: \"There is no shrill squawking from Baby Yoda, no tantrum, no spit-up, no uncontrollable shrieking that burrows into a parent\u2019s psyche like a dentist\u2019s drill shredding a soft, pink nerve.\"<ref name=\"Breznican1126\" /> Likewise, ''Vulture'' writer Kathryn VanArendonk said the show ignores or does not address many parenting details that make fatherhood difficult, such as what the Child eats, when he goes him to sleep, and whether he wears diapers. She wrote: \"''The Mandalorian'' is uninterested in diapers, and so Mando gets to be a very particular image of fatherhood: the guy who doesn't have to sweat the small stuff.\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> VanAnderonk described this as a [[wish fulfillment]] fantasy for parents or prospective parents: \"a vision of parenting stripped so thoroughly of all detail and specificity that all that\u2019s left are archetypes: the parent, the child\".<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" />\n\nThe Child encounters a handful of other protector figures throughout the first season, including Omera, IG-11, and Peli Motto.<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> Some observers have criticized the series for the fact that the Mandalorian repeatedly leaves the Child alone or in the hands of relative strangers,<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /> as well as for making decisions that place the Child in danger. One example is in \"Chapter 6: The Prisoner\", when he allows a team of dangerous mercenaries to use his ship while the Child is on board, nearly resulting in the Child's death.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" /><ref name=\"White1218\">{{cite news |last=White |first=Brett |title=Is Baby Yoda Bad to the Bone?

When the Mandalorian accidentally wakes the child, who had been sleeping in Peli's arms, she chides him: \"Do you have any idea how long it took me to get it to sleep?\"<ref name=\"VanArendonk0103\" /> She also condemns the Mandalorian for leaving the child alone on the ship, saying: \"you have an awful lot to learn about raising a young one\".<ref name=\"Keane1207\" /> ''[[ScreenCrush]]'' writer Matt Singer argued the Mandalorian's parenting errors makes the show that much more appealing and relatable because making mistakes is a large part of being a parent.<ref name=\"Singer1213\" />\n\n===Good and evil; nature versus nurture===\nOne scene in \"Chapter 7: The Reckoning\" led many fans to reevaluate the Child and question whether he may demonstrate evil tendencies. During a scene on the Mandalorian's spaceship, the Child observes as the Mandalorian and Cara Dune engage in a friendly [[arm wrestling]] match.

Miller suggested the Child could be putting on a similar performance.<ref name=\"Miller1218\" /> One fan theory suggests the Child could be related to a prophecy in a past ''Star Wars'' work that predicted an evil that could consume the galaxy. The prophecy, described in the novel ''[[Star Wars: Master and Apprentice]]'' (2019), says: \"The danger of the past is not past, but sleeps in an egg. When the egg cracks, it will threaten the galaxy entire.\" Fans theorized this could refer to the Child, who sleeps in an egg-like bassinet in ''The Mandalorian''.<ref name=\"Abdulbaki0106\" /> Others have theorized the reason the Imperial remnant wants the Child is to turn him over to the Dark Side of the Force,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /> or for use as a weapon.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> Moff Gideon in the season finale says: \"You may think you have some idea what you\u2019re in possession of, but you do not.\" Peter Foy of ''Comic Book Resources'' suggested this could allude to the Child's potential to cause mass destruction.<ref name=\"Foy1221\" />\n\nCaitlin Gallagher of ''[[Bustle (website)|Bustle]]'' suggested rather than building toward the Child becoming evil, the show could be suggesting the Mandalorian needs to find a way to raise the Child in a less violent environment.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> All season long, the Child has witnessed those around him committing violent acts.<ref name=\"Milner1222\">{{cite news |last=Milner |first=Sarah Bea |title=The Mandalorian: Baby Yoda Learns About Good & Bad In A Powerful Way |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=December 22, 2019 |url=https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |accessdate=February 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191223125659/https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-makes-statement-nature-versus-nurture/ |archive-date=December 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> For example, ''Vulture'' writer Keith Phipps noticed that when IG-11 kills multiple stormtroopers in front of him, the Child has a \"look of wonder\" in his eyes, which Phipps said \"is hilarious, but also a little chilling\".<ref name=\"Phipps1227\" /> Some writers applied a [[nature versus nurture]] argument to this, contending the Child is becoming violent because of what he is learning based on the actions around him.<ref name=\"Gallagher1226\" /> This suggests the Child is not inherently good or evil,<ref name=\"Milner1222\" /><ref name=\"Foy1221\" /> but that instead, like all children, he is impressionable and does not fully understand the events occurring around him.

[[Leonardo DiCaprio]] stars as [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Edward \"Teddy\" Daniels, who is investigating a psychiatric facility on Shutter Island after one of the patients goes missing. [[Mark Ruffalo]] plays his partner officer; [[Ben Kingsley]] is the facility's lead psychiatrist; [[Max von Sydow]] is a German doctor; and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] is Daniels's wife. Released on February 19, 2010, the film received mostly positive  reviews from critics, was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2010#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2010]], and grossed over $294 million worldwide.\n\nThe film is also noteworthy for its soundtrack using classical ([[Gustav Mahler]]) and mainly [[Modernism (music)|modern classical music]] by composers such as [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[John Cage]], [[Ingram Marshall]], and [[Max Richter]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1954, [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] Edward Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the [[Insanity defense|criminally insane]] on Shutter Island in [[Boston Harbor]]. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: \"The law of 4; who is 67?\" The two men arrive just before a massive storm, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days.\n\nDaniels and Aule find the staff confrontational. Lead psychiatrist John Cawley refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor Lester Sheehan left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. They are told that Ward C is off limits and the lighthouse has already been searched. While being interviewed, one patient writes the word \"RUN\" in Daniels's notepad. Daniels starts to have [[migraine]] headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and has waking visions of his experiences as a U.S. Army soldier during the [[Dachau concentration camp#Liberation|liberation of Dachau]] including [[Dachau liberation reprisals|reprisals against the guards]]. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by arsonist Andrew Laeddis. In one instance, she tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island\u2014as is Laeddis, who everyone claims was never there. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was his ulterior motive for taking the case.\n\nDaniels and Aule find Solando has resurfaced with no explanation, prompting Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. He encounters George Noyce, a patient in solitary confinement, who claims that the doctors are experimenting on patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]]. Noyce warns that everyone else on the island, including Aule, is playing an elaborate game designed for Daniels.\n\nDaniels regroups with Aule and climbs the cliffs toward the lighthouse. They become separated, and Daniels later sees what he believes to be Aule's body on the rocks below. By the time he climbs down, the body has disappeared, but he finds a cave where he discovers a woman in hiding, who claims to be the real Rachel Solando. She states that she is a former psychiatrist at the hospital who discovered the experiments with [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic medication]] and trans-orbital lobotomy in an attempt to develop [[mind control]] techniques. Before she could report her findings to the authorities, she was forcibly committed to Ashecliffe as a patient. Daniels returns to the hospital, but finds no evidence of Aule ever being there.\n\nConvinced Aule was taken to the lighthouse, Daniels breaks in, only to discover Cawley waiting for him. Cawley explains that Daniels is actually Andrew Laeddis, their \"most dangerous patient\", incarcerated in Ward C for murdering his [[Bipolar disorder|manic depressive]] wife, Dolores, after she drowned their children. Edward Daniels and Rachel Solando are [[anagram]]s of Andrew Laeddis and Dolores Chanal, and the little girl from Laeddis's recurring dreams is his daughter Rachel. According to Cawley, the events of the past several days have been designed to break Laeddis's [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]]-laden insanity by allowing him to play out the role of Daniels. The hospital staff were part of the test, including Sheehan posing as Aule and a nurse posing as Rachel Solando. Laeddis\u2019s migraines were withdrawal symptoms from his medication, as were his hallucinations of the \"real Rachel Solando\". Overwhelmed, Laeddis faints.\n\nHe awakens in the hospital under the watch of Cawley and Sheehan. When questioned, he tells the truth in a coherent manner, satisfying the doctors. Cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before, but Laeddis quickly regressed. He warns this will be Laeddis's last chance; otherwise, they will have to lobotomize him, as he previously attacked Noyce for calling him by his real name.\n\nSome time later, Laeddis relaxes on the hospital grounds with Sheehan, but calls him \"Chuck\" again, saying they must leave the island because bad things are going on. Sheehan shakes his head to Cawley and Cawley gestures to the orderlies to take Laeddis to be lobotomized. Before being led away, Laeddis asks Sheehan if it would be better \"to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--CAST LISTINGS SHOULD MATCH CREDITS OF THE FILM.

[[Leonardo DiCaprio]] stars as [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshal]] Edward \"Teddy\" Daniels, who is investigating a psychiatric facility on Shutter Island after one of the patients goes missing. [[Mark Ruffalo]] plays his partner officer; [[Ben Kingsley]] is the facility's lead psychiatrist; [[Max von Sydow]] is a German doctor; and [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] is Daniels's wife. Released on February 19, 2010, the film received mostly positive  reviews from critics, was chosen by [[National Board of Review]] as one of the [[National Board of Review Awards 2010#Top 10 Films|top ten films of 2010]], and grossed over $294 million worldwide.\n\nThe film is also noteworthy for its soundtrack using classical ([[Gustav Mahler]]) and mainly [[Modernism (music)|modern classical music]] by composers such as [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[John Cage]], [[Ingram Marshall]], and [[Max Richter]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn 1954, [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] Edward Daniels and his new partner Chuck Aule travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the [[Insanity defense|criminally insane]] on Shutter Island in [[Boston Harbor]]. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: \"The law of 4; who is 67?\" The two men arrive just before a massive storm, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days.\n\nDaniels and Aule find the staff confrontational. Lead psychiatrist John Cawley refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor Lester Sheehan left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. They are told that Ward C is off limits and the lighthouse has already been searched. While being interviewed, one patient writes the word \"RUN\" in Daniels's notepad. Daniels starts to have [[migraine]] headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and has waking visions of his experiences as a U.S. Army soldier during the [[Dachau concentration camp#Liberation|liberation of Dachau]] including [[Dachau liberation reprisals|reprisals against the guards]]. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by arsonist Andrew Laeddis. In one instance, she tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island\u2014as is Laeddis, who everyone claims was never there. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was his ulterior motive for taking the case.\n\nDaniels and Aule find Solando has resurfaced with no explanation, prompting Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. He encounters George Noyce, a patient in solitary confinement, who claims that the doctors are experimenting on patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]]. Noyce warns that everyone else on the island, including Aule, is playing an elaborate game designed for Daniels.\n\nDaniels regroups with Aule and climbs the cliffs toward the lighthouse. They become separated, and Daniels later sees what he believes to be Aule's body on the rocks below. By the time he climbs down, the body has disappeared, but he finds a cave where he discovers a woman in hiding, who claims to be the real Rachel Solando. She states that she is a former psychiatrist at the hospital who discovered the experiments with [[Psychoactive drug|psychotropic medication]] and trans-orbital lobotomy in an attempt to develop [[mind control]] techniques. Before she could report her findings to the authorities, she was forcibly committed to Ashecliffe as a patient. Daniels returns to the hospital, but finds no evidence of Aule ever being there.\n\nConvinced Aule was taken to the lighthouse, Daniels breaks in, only to discover Cawley waiting for him. Cawley explains that Daniels is actually Andrew Laeddis, their \"most dangerous patient\", incarcerated in Ward C for murdering his [[Bipolar disorder|manic depressive]] wife, Dolores, after she drowned their children. Edward Daniels and Rachel Solando are [[anagram]]s of Andrew Laeddis and Dolores Chanal, and the little girl from Laeddis's recurring dreams is his daughter Rachel. According to Cawley, the events of the past several days have been designed to break Laeddis's [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]]-laden insanity by allowing him to play out the role of Daniels. The hospital staff were part of the test, including Sheehan posing as Aule and a nurse posing as Rachel Solando. Laeddis\u2019s migraines were withdrawal symptoms from his medication, as were his hallucinations of the \"real Rachel Solando\". Overwhelmed, Laeddis faints.\n\nHe awakens in the hospital under the watch of Cawley and Sheehan. When questioned, he tells the truth in a coherent manner, satisfying the doctors. Cawley notes that they had achieved this state nine months before, but Laeddis quickly regressed. He warns this will be Laeddis's last chance; otherwise, they will have to lobotomize him, as he previously attacked Noyce for calling him by his real name.\n\nSome time later, Laeddis relaxes on the hospital grounds with Sheehan, but calls him \"Chuck\" again, saying they must leave the island because bad things are going on. Sheehan shakes his head to Cawley and Cawley gestures to the orderlies to take Laeddis to be lobotomized. Before being led away, Laeddis asks Sheehan if it would be better \"to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?\"\n\n==Cast==\n<!--CAST LISTINGS SHOULD MATCH CREDITS OF THE FILM.
