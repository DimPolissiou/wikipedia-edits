Simple sugars, also called [[monosaccharide]]s, include [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[galactose]]. Compound sugars, also called [[disaccharide]]s or double sugars, are molecules composed of two monosaccharides joined by a [[glycosidic bond]]. Common examples are [[sucrose]] (glucose + fructose), [[lactose]] (glucose + galactose), and [[maltose]] (two molecules of glucose). In the body, compound sugars are [[hydrolysed]] into simple sugars. '''Table sugar''', '''granulated sugar''' or '''regular sugar''' refers to sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose.\n\nLonger chains of monosaccharides are not regarded as sugars, and are called [[oligosaccharide]]s or [[polysaccharide]]s. Some other chemical substances, such as [[glycerol]] and [[sugar alcohol]]s, may have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugar. \n\nSugars are found in the tissues of most plants. [[Honey]] and [[fruit]] are abundant natural sources of unbounded simple sugars. Sucrose is especially concentrated in [[sugarcane]] and [[sugar beet]], making them ideal for efficient commercial [[extract]]ion to make refined sugar. In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion [[tonne]]s. Maltose may be produced by [[malt]]ing grain. Lactose is the only sugar that cannot be extracted from plants. It can only be found in [[milk]], including human breast milk, and in some [[dairy product]]s. A cheap source of sugar is [[corn syrup]], industrially produced by converting corn [[starch]] into sugars, such as maltose, fructose and glucose.\n[[File:Zuckerplastik zur Freiheitsidee 1880 Zucker-Museum.jpg|thumb|German sugar sculpture, 1880]]\n\nSucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g. cookies and cakes), is sometimes [[Added sugar|added]] to commercially available [[processed food]] and beverages, and may be used by people as a sweetener for foods (e.g. toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g. coffee and tea). The average person consumes about {{convert|24|kg}} of sugar each year, or {{convert|33.1|kg|}} in [[Developed country|developed countries]], equivalent to over 260 [[food calorie]]s per day. As sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th&nbsp;century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high in sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to [[human health]]. Excessive consumption of sugar has been implicated in the onset of [[obesity]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[dementia]], and [[tooth decay]]. Numerous studies have tried to clarify those implications, but with varying results, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that consume little or no sugar. In 2015, the [[World Health Organization]] recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of [[free sugar]]s to less than 10%, and encouraged a reduction to below 5%, of their total [[Energy homeostasis|energy intake]].<ref name=\"WHO 2015p4\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[etymology]] reflects the spread of the commodity.

Monosaccharides are also called \"simple sugars,\" the most important being glucose. Most monosaccharides have a formula that conforms to {{chem|C|n|H|2n|O|n}} with n between 3 and 7 ([[deoxyribose]] being an exception). [[Glucose]] has the [[molecular formula]] {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}. The names of typical sugars end with -''ose'', as in \"[[glucose]]\" and \"[[fructose]]\". Sometimes such words may also refer to any types of [[carbohydrates]] soluble in water. The [[Open-chain compound|acyclic]] mono- and disaccharides contain either [[aldehyde]] groups or [[ketone]] groups. These [[carbonyl|carbon-oxygen]] double bonds (C=O) are the reactive centers. All saccharides with more than one ring in their structure result from two or more monosaccharides joined by [[glycosidic bond]]s with the resultant loss of a molecule of water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) per bond.<ref name=Pigman>{{cite book |last=Pigman |first=Ward |author2=Horton, D. |title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A |editor=Pigman and Horton |series= |edition=2nd |year=1972 |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego |isbn=978-0-12-556352-9 |pages=1\u201367}}</ref>\n\n[[Monosaccharides]] in a closed-chain form can form glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, creating disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as [[starch]]). [[Enzymes]] must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become [[metabolism|metabolized]]. After digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides present in the blood and internal tissues include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Many [[pentose]]s and [[hexose]]s can form [[Heterocyclic compound|ring structures]]. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, so many of the reactions typical of these groups cannot occur. Glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], with less than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.<ref name=Pigman/>\n\n===Natural polymers===\n[[Biopolymer]]s of sugars are common in nature. Through photosynthesis, plants produce [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] (G3P), a phosphated 3-carbon sugar that is used by the cell to make monosaccharides such as glucose ({{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}) or (as in cane and beet) sucrose ({{chem|C|12|H|22|O|11}}). Monosaccharides may be further converted into [[polysaccharides#structural polysaccharides|structural polysaccharides]] such as [[cellulose]] and [[pectin]] for [[cell wall]] construction or into energy reserves in the form of [[polysaccharides#storage polysaccharides|storage polysaccharides]] such as starch or [[inulin]]. Starch, consisting of two different polymers of glucose, is a readily degradable form of chemical [[potential energy|energy]] stored by [[cell (biology)|cells]], and can be converted to other types of energy.<ref name=Pigman/> Another polymer of glucose is cellulose, which is a linear chain composed of several hundred or thousand glucose units. It is used by plants as a structural component in their cell walls. Humans can digest cellulose only to a very limited extent, though [[ruminant]]s can do so with the help of [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria in their gut.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01089198 |last1=Joshi |first1=S |last2=Agte |first2=V |title=Digestibility of dietary fiber components in vegetarian men |journal=Plant Foods for Human Nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands) |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=39\u201344 |year=1995 |pmid=8719737}}</ref> [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] are built up of the monosaccharides [[deoxyribose]] and  [[ribose]], respectively.

Removal of color is achieved by using either a granular [[activated carbon]] or an [[ion-exchange resin]]. The sugar syrup is concentrated by boiling and then cooled and seeded with sugar crystals, causing the sugar to crystallize out. The liquor is spun off in a centrifuge and the white crystals are dried in hot air and ready to be packaged or used. The surplus liquor is made into refiners' molasses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sucrose.com/lref.html |title=How Sugar is Refined |publisher=SKIL |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref>\n\nThe [[International Commission for Uniform Methods of Sugar Analysis]] sets standards for the measurement of the purity of refined sugar, known as ICUMSA numbers; lower numbers indicate a higher level of purity in the refined sugar.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Deulgaonkar |first=Atul |date=March 12\u201325, 2005 |title=A case for reform |journal=Frontline |volume=22 |issue=8 |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2208/stories/20050422000804500.htm |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728040727/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2208/stories/20050422000804500.htm |archivedate=2011-07-28 |df=}}</ref>\n\nRefined sugar is widely used for industrial needs for higher quality.

They are used in baked goods, confectionery, and [[toffee]]s.<ref name=BS/> Their darkness is due to the amount of molasses they contain. They may be classified based on their darkness or country of origin. For instance:<ref name=TSA />\n* Light brown, with little content of molasses (about 3.5%)\n* Dark brown, with higher content of molasses (about 6.5%)\n* [[Non-centrifugal cane sugar]], unrefined and hence very dark cane sugar obtained by evaporating water from sugarcane juice, such as:\n** [[Panela]], also known as rapadura, chancaca, piloncillo or uluru dust.\n** Some varieties of [[muscovado]], also known as Barbados sugar.

A liquid sugar containing 50% sugar and 50% water is called simple syrup.\n** Syrups can also be made by [[reduction (cooking)|reducing]] naturally sweet juices such as [[sugarcane|cane]] juice, or [[maple syrup|maple]] sap. \n** [[Corn syrup]] is made by converting [[corn starch]] to sugars (mainly maltose and glucose).\n** [[High-fructose corn syrup]] (HFCS), is produced by further processing corn syrup to convert some of its glucose into fructose.\n** [[Inverted sugar syrup]], commonly known as invert syrup or invert sugar, is a mixture of two simple sugars\u2014glucose and fructose\u2014that is made by heating granulated sugar in water. It is used in breads, cakes, and beverages for adjusting sweetness, aiding moisture retention and avoiding crystallization of sugars.<ref name=BS/>\n* [[Molasses]] and [[treacle]] are obtained by removing sugar from sugarcane or sugar beet juice, as a byproduct of sugar production. They may be blended with the above-mentioned syrups to enhance sweetness and used in a range of baked goods and confectionery including toffees and [[licorice]].<ref name=BS/> \n** Blackstrap molasses, also known as black treacle, has dark color, relatively small sugar content and strong flavour. It is sometimes added to animal feed, or processed to produce [[rum]], or [[ethanol]] for fuel.\n** Regular molasses and [[golden syrup]] treacle have higher sugar content and lighter color, relative to blackstrap.\n* In [[winemaking]], [[sugars in wine|fruit sugars]] are converted into alcohol by a [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] process. If the [[must]] formed by pressing the fruit has a low sugar content, additional sugar may be added to raise the alcohol content of the wine in a process called [[chaptalization]]. In the production of sweet wines, fermentation may be halted before it has run its full course, leaving behind some [[Sweetness of wine|residual sugar]] that gives the wine its sweet taste.<ref name=\"Oxford pg 665-666\">{{cite book |title=The Oxford Companion to Wine |edition=3rd |last=Robinson |first=Jancis |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-860990-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00janc/page/665 665\u201366] |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00janc/page/665 }}</ref>\n\n=== Other sweeteners ===\n* Low-calorie sweeteners are often made of [[maltodextrin]] with added sweeteners.

Simple sugars, also called [[monosaccharide]]s, include [[glucose]], [[fructose]], and [[galactose]]. Compound sugars, also called [[disaccharide]]s or double sugars, are molecules composed of two monosaccharides joined by a [[glycosidic bond]]. Common examples are [[sucrose]] (glucose + fructose), [[lactose]] (glucose + galactose), and [[maltose]] (two molecules of glucose). In the body, compound sugars are [[hydrolysed]] into simple sugars. '''Table sugar''', '''granulated sugar''' or '''regular sugar''' refers to sucrose, a disaccharide composed of glucose and fructose.\n\nLonger chains of monosaccharides are not regarded as sugars, and are called [[oligosaccharide]]s or [[polysaccharide]]s. Some other chemical substances, such as [[glycerol]] and [[sugar alcohol]]s, may have a sweet taste, but are not classified as sugar. \n\nSugars are found in the tissues of most plants. [[Honey]] and [[fruit]] are abundant natural sources of unbounded simple sugars. Sucrose is especially concentrated in [[sugarcane]] and [[sugar beet]], making them ideal for efficient commercial [[extract]]ion to make refined sugar. In 2016, the combined world production of those two crops was about two billion [[tonne]]s. Maltose may be produced by [[malt]]ing grain. Lactose is the only sugar that cannot be extracted from plants. It can only be found in [[milk]], including human breast milk, and in some [[dairy product]]s. A cheap source of sugar is [[corn syrup]], industrially produced by converting corn [[starch]] into sugars, such as maltose, fructose and glucose.\n[[File:Zuckerplastik zur Freiheitsidee 1880 Zucker-Museum.jpg|thumb|German sugar sculpture, 1880]]\n\nSucrose is used in prepared foods (e.g. cookies and cakes), is sometimes [[Added sugar|added]] to commercially available [[processed food]] and beverages, and may be used by people as a sweetener for foods (e.g. toast and cereal) and beverages (e.g. coffee and tea). The average person consumes about {{convert|24|kg}} of sugar each year, or {{convert|33.1|kg|}} in [[Developed country|developed countries]], equivalent to over 260 [[food calorie]]s per day. As sugar consumption grew in the latter part of the 20th&nbsp;century, researchers began to examine whether a diet high in sugar, especially refined sugar, was damaging to [[human health]]. Excessive consumption of sugar has been implicated in the onset of [[obesity]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[cardiovascular disease]], [[dementia]], and [[tooth decay]]. Numerous studies have tried to clarify those implications, but with varying results, mainly because of the difficulty of finding populations for use as controls that consume little or no sugar. In 2015, the [[World Health Organization]] recommended that adults and children reduce their intake of [[free sugar]]s to less than 10%, and encouraged a reduction to below 5%, of their total [[Energy homeostasis|energy intake]].<ref name=\"WHO 2015p4\"/>\n\n==Etymology==\nThe [[etymology]] reflects the spread of the commodity.

Monosaccharides are also called \"simple sugars,\" the most important being glucose. Most monosaccharides have a formula that conforms to {{chem|C|n|H|2n|O|n}} with n between 3 and 7 ([[deoxyribose]] being an exception). [[Glucose]] has the [[molecular formula]] {{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}. The names of typical sugars end with -''ose'', as in \"[[glucose]]\" and \"[[fructose]]\". Sometimes such words may also refer to any types of [[carbohydrates]] soluble in water. The [[Open-chain compound|acyclic]] mono- and disaccharides contain either [[aldehyde]] groups or [[ketone]] groups. These [[carbonyl|carbon-oxygen]] double bonds (C=O) are the reactive centers. All saccharides with more than one ring in their structure result from two or more monosaccharides joined by [[glycosidic bond]]s with the resultant loss of a molecule of water ({{chem|H|2|O}}) per bond.<ref name=Pigman>{{cite book |last=Pigman |first=Ward |author2=Horton, D. |title=The Carbohydrates: Chemistry and Biochemistry Vol 1A |editor=Pigman and Horton |series= |edition=2nd |year=1972 |publisher=Academic Press |location=San Diego |isbn=978-0-12-556352-9 |pages=1\u201367}}</ref>\n\n[[Monosaccharides]] in a closed-chain form can form glycosidic bonds with other monosaccharides, creating disaccharides (such as sucrose) and polysaccharides (such as [[starch]]). [[Enzymes]] must hydrolyze or otherwise break these glycosidic bonds before such compounds become [[metabolism|metabolized]]. After digestion and absorption the principal monosaccharides present in the blood and internal tissues include glucose, fructose, and galactose. Many [[pentose]]s and [[hexose]]s can form [[Heterocyclic compound|ring structures]]. In these closed-chain forms, the aldehyde or ketone group remains non-free, so many of the reactions typical of these groups cannot occur. Glucose in solution exists mostly in the ring form at [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], with less than 0.1% of the molecules in the open-chain form.<ref name=Pigman/>\n\n===Natural polymers===\n[[Biopolymer]]s of sugars are common in nature. Through photosynthesis, plants produce [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate]] (G3P), a phosphated 3-carbon sugar that is used by the cell to make monosaccharides such as glucose ({{chem|C|6|H|12|O|6}}) or (as in cane and beet) sucrose ({{chem|C|12|H|22|O|11}}). Monosaccharides may be further converted into [[polysaccharides#structural polysaccharides|structural polysaccharides]] such as [[cellulose]] and [[pectin]] for [[cell wall]] construction or into energy reserves in the form of [[polysaccharides#storage polysaccharides|storage polysaccharides]] such as starch or [[inulin]]. Starch, consisting of two different polymers of glucose, is a readily degradable form of chemical [[potential energy|energy]] stored by [[cell (biology)|cells]], and can be converted to other types of energy.<ref name=Pigman/> Another polymer of glucose is cellulose, which is a linear chain composed of several hundred or thousand glucose units. It is used by plants as a structural component in their cell walls. Humans can digest cellulose only to a very limited extent, though [[ruminant]]s can do so with the help of [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria in their gut.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/BF01089198 |last1=Joshi |first1=S |last2=Agte |first2=V |title=Digestibility of dietary fiber components in vegetarian men |journal=Plant Foods for Human Nutrition (Dordrecht, Netherlands) |volume=48 |issue=1 |pages=39\u201344 |year=1995 |pmid=8719737}}</ref> [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] are built up of the monosaccharides [[deoxyribose]] and  [[ribose]], respectively.

It stars [[Macaulay Culkin]], [[Joe Pesci]], [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]], and [[Catherine O'Hara]]. The film follows an eight-year-old boy (Culkin), who must defend his home from two burglars (Pesci and Stern) after his family mistakenly leaves him behind on their Christmas vacation. It was filmed between February and May of 1990, in an array of locations. The film was originally meant to be a production from [[Warner Bros.]], but was changed to a [[20th Century Fox]] production when Hughes exceeded a $10 million budget that he promised for the film with Warner Bros. \n\n''Home Alone'' premiered on November 10, 1990, in Chicago, and was released wider in the United States on November 16, 1990. With a total gross of $476.7 million, it was the highest-grossing live-action comedy ever, and held the record until it was overtaken by ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'' in 2011. The film received two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] for Culkin, as well as two [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], which was composed by [[John Williams]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"Somewhere in My Memory\". ''Home Alone'' became the highest-grossing live-action comedy film of all time in the United States and held the record worldwide until it was overtaken by ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'' in 2011. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics on its initial release, ''Home Alone'' has been hailed as a holiday classic among audiences and is often regarded as one of the best Christmas films ever made.\n\n''Home Alone'' spawned a successful [[Home Alone (franchise)|film franchise]] that started with the 1992 sequel ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]'', which is the only ''Home Alone'' sequel to have most of the original cast reprising their roles.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTICE: Plot summaries should be 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT. Do not add unnecessary detail to this section. -->\nThe McCallister family is preparing to spend Christmas in Paris, gathering at Peter and Kate's home in a [[Chicago]] [[Chicago land|suburb]] on the night before their departure. Peter and Kate's youngest son, Kevin, is the subject of ridicule by his older siblings. Later, Kevin accidentally ruins the family dinner and their flight tickets to Paris after a scuffle with his older brother Buzz, resulting in him getting sent to the [[attic]] of the house as a punishment where he berates Kate and wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds cause damage to the power lines, which causes a [[power outage]] and resets the alarm clocks, causing the family to oversleep. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport, Kevin is accidentally left behind.\n\nKevin wakes to find the house empty and, thinking that his wish has come true, is overjoyed with his newfound freedom. However, he soon becomes frightened by his next door neighbor, Old Man Marley, who is rumored to be a [[serial killer]] who murdered his own family, as well as the \"Wet Bandits\", Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood and have targeted the McCallisters' house. Kevin tricks them into thinking that his family is still home, forcing them to put their plans on hold.\n\nKate realizes mid-flight that Kevin was left behind, and upon arrival in Paris, the family discovers that all flights for the next two days are booked. Peter and the rest of the family stays in his brother's apartment in Paris while Kate manages to get a flight back to the United States, but only gets as far as [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. She attempts to book a flight to Chicago, but again, everything is booked. Unable to accept this, Kate is overheard by Gus Polinski, the lead member of a traveling polka band, who offers to let her travel with them to [[Chicago]] on their way to [[Milwaukee]] in a moving van, which she gratefully accepts.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry and Marv finally realize that Kevin is home alone, and on Christmas Eve, Kevin overhears them discussing plans to break into his house that night. Kevin starts to miss his family and asks the local [[Santa Claus]] impersonator if he could bring his family back for Christmas. He goes to church and watches a [[choir]] perform, then meets Old Man Marley, who dispels the rumors about him. He points out his granddaughter in the choir, whom he never gets to meet as he and his son are estranged; Kevin suggests that he should reconcile with his son.\n\nKevin returns home and rigs the house with [[booby trap]]s to take on the burglars. Harry and Marv break in, spring the traps, and suffer various injuries. While the duo pursues Kevin around the house, he calls the police and flees, luring them into a neighboring home which they previously broke into. Harry and Marv ambush him and prepare to get their revenge, but Marley intervenes and knocks them unconscious with his snow shovel. The police arrive and arrest Harry and Marv, having identified all the houses they broke into due to Marv's destructive characteristic of flooding them.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Kevin is disappointed to find that his family is still gone. He then hears Kate enter the house and call for him; they reconcile and are soon joined by Peter, Buzz, Jeff, Megan, and Linnie, who waited in Paris until they could obtain a direct flight to Chicago. Kevin keeps silent about his encounter with Harry and Marv, although Peter finds Harry's knocked-out gold tooth. Kevin then observes Marley reuniting with his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter. Marley notices Kevin, and the pair wave to each other.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Macaulay Culkin]] as Kevin, a rambunctious eight-year-old with a penchant for creating harmful inventions\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Harry, a short and hotheaded thief who targets the McCallisters' home with Marv\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Marv, a tall and dim-witted thief who targets the McCallisters' home with Harry\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Peter, Kevin's father\n* [[Roberts Blossom]] as Marley, Kevin's elderly neighbor\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Kate, Kevin's mother and Peter's wife\n* [[Angela Goethals]] as Linnie, Kevin's older sister\n* [[Devin Ratray]] as Buzz, Kevin's oldest brother who often gets him into trouble\n* [[Gerry Bamman]] as Uncle Frank, Peter's older brother\n* [[Hillary Wolf]] as Megan, Kevin's oldest sister\n* [[John Candy]] as Gus Polinski, polka performer who helps Kate\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Officer Balzak\n* [[Michael C.

Hughes explained that \"I was going away on vacation, and making a list of everything I didn\u2019t want to forget. I thought, 'well, I'd better not forget my kids.' Then I thought, 'what if I left my 10-year-old son at home?

Hughes had promised the studio he could make the movie for no more than $10 million, considerably less than most feature film production budgets of that era. Concerned that the film might exceed that amount, even minimally, and that Warner would insist on keeping to it, Hughes met secretly with [[20th Century Fox]] before production to see if they would be interested in funding the project if Warner proved as inflexible as the producer feared. A copy of the script was \"clandestinely\" delivered to Fox, according to [[executive producer]] Scott Rosenfelt, bypassing the legal restrictions that would have otherwise prevented Fox from seeing it until the project was in [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]].<ref name=\"The Movies that Made Us\">{{cite news|last=Bucklow|first=Andrew|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212233609/https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/home-alone-secrets-revealed-in-netflix-show-the-movies-that-made-us/news-story/7dd4896680c9c157e18b7f4e264c418f|title=''Home Alone'' secrets revealed in Netflix show 'The Movies That Made Us'|date=December 4, 2019|newspaper=[[news.com.au]]|accessdate=December 4, 2019|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.news.com.au/entertainment/movies/home-alone-secrets-revealed-in-netflix-show-the-movies-that-made-us/news-story/7dd4896680c9c157e18b7f4e264c418f|archive-date=2020-02-12}}</ref>\n\nEarly in production, the film's budget grew to $14.7 million, well past the limit Warner had imposed. The studio demanded that it be cut by $1.2 million; the producers responded with a memo arguing that the budget could not be cut any further. Warner, unconvinced, shut down production the next day.

Hughes]] and directed by [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]]. It stars [[Macaulay Culkin]], [[Joe Pesci]], [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]], [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]], and [[Catherine O'Hara]]. The film follows an eight-year-old boy (Culkin), who must defend his home from two burglars (Pesci and Stern) after his family mistakenly leaves him behind on their Christmas vacation. It was filmed between February and May of 1990, in an array of locations. The film was originally meant to be a production from [[Warner Bros.]], but was changed to a [[20th Century Fox]] production when Hughes exceeded a $10 million budget that he promised for the film with Warner Bros. \n\n''Home Alone'' premiered on November 10, 1990, in Chicago, and was released wider in the United States on November 16, 1990. With a total gross of $476.7 million, it was the highest-grossing live-action comedy ever, and held the record until it was overtaken by ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'' in 2011. The film received two [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy]] for Culkin, as well as two [[Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], which was composed by [[John Williams]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for \"Somewhere in My Memory\". ''Home Alone'' became the highest-grossing live-action comedy film of all time in the United States and held the record worldwide until it was overtaken by ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'' in 2011. Despite receiving mixed reviews from critics on its initial release, ''Home Alone'' has been hailed as a holiday classic among audiences and is often regarded as one of the best Christmas films ever made.\n\n''Home Alone'' spawned a successful [[Home Alone (franchise)|film franchise]] that started with the 1992 sequel ''[[Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]]'', which is the only ''Home Alone'' sequel to have most of the original cast reprising their roles.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- NOTICE: Plot summaries should be 400-700 words. See WP:FILMPLOT. Do not add unnecessary detail to this section. -->\nThe McCallister family is preparing to spend Christmas in Paris, gathering at Peter and Kate's home in a [[Chicago]] [[Chicago land|suburb]] on the night before their departure. Peter and Kate's youngest son, Kevin, is the subject of ridicule by his older siblings. Later, Kevin accidentally ruins the family dinner and their flight tickets to Paris after a scuffle with his older brother Buzz, resulting in him getting sent to the [[attic]] of the house as a punishment where he berates Kate and wishes that his family would disappear. During the night, heavy winds cause damage to the power lines, which causes a [[power outage]] and resets the alarm clocks, causing the family to oversleep. In the confusion and rush to get to the airport, Kevin is accidentally left behind.\n\nKevin wakes to find the house empty and, thinking that his wish has come true, is overjoyed with his newfound freedom. However, he soon becomes frightened by his next door neighbor, Old Man Marley, who is rumored to be a [[serial killer]] who murdered his own family, as well as the \"Wet Bandits\", Harry and Marv, a pair of burglars who have been breaking into other vacant houses in the neighborhood and have targeted the McCallisters' house. Kevin tricks them into thinking that his family is still home, forcing them to put their plans on hold.\n\nKate realizes mid-flight that Kevin was left behind, and upon arrival in Paris, the family discovers that all flights for the next two days are booked. Peter and the rest of the family stays in his brother's apartment in Paris while Kate manages to get a flight back to the United States, but only gets as far as [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. She attempts to book a flight to Chicago, but again, everything is booked. Unable to accept this, Kate is overheard by Gus Polinski, the lead member of a traveling polka band, who offers to let her travel with them to [[Chicago]] on their way to [[Milwaukee]] in a moving van, which she gratefully accepts.\n\nMeanwhile, Harry and Marv finally realize that Kevin is home alone, and on Christmas Eve, Kevin overhears them discussing plans to break into his house that night. Kevin starts to miss his family and asks the local [[Santa Claus]] impersonator if he could bring his family back for Christmas. He goes to church and watches a [[choir]] perform, then meets Old Man Marley, who dispels the rumors about him. He points out his granddaughter in the choir, whom he never gets to meet as he and his son are estranged; Kevin suggests that he should reconcile with his son.\n\nKevin returns home and rigs the house with [[booby trap]]s to take on the burglars. Harry and Marv break in, spring the traps, and suffer various injuries. While the duo pursues Kevin around the house, he calls the police and flees, luring them into a neighboring home which they previously broke into. Harry and Marv ambush him and prepare to get their revenge, but Marley intervenes and knocks them unconscious with his snow shovel. The police arrive and arrest Harry and Marv, having identified all the houses they broke into due to Marv's destructive characteristic of flooding them.\n\nOn Christmas Day, Kevin is disappointed to find that his family is still gone. He then hears Kate enter the house and call for him; they reconcile and are soon joined by Peter, Buzz, Jeff, Megan, and Linnie, who waited in Paris until they could obtain a direct flight to Chicago. Kevin keeps silent about his encounter with Harry and Marv, although Peter finds Harry's knocked-out gold tooth. Kevin then observes Marley reuniting with his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter. Marley notices Kevin, and the pair wave to each other.\n\n==Cast==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast list|\n* [[Macaulay Culkin]] as Kevin, a rambunctious eight-year-old with a penchant for creating harmful inventions\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as Harry, a short and hotheaded thief who targets the McCallisters' home with Marv\n* [[Daniel Stern (actor)|Daniel Stern]] as Marv, a tall and dim-witted thief who targets the McCallisters' home with Harry\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as Peter, Kevin's father\n* [[Roberts Blossom]] as Marley, Kevin's elderly neighbor\n* [[Catherine O'Hara]] as Kate, Kevin's mother and Peter's wife\n* [[Angela Goethals]] as Linnie, Kevin's older sister\n* [[Devin Ratray]] as Buzz, Kevin's oldest brother who often gets him into trouble\n* [[Gerry Bamman]] as Uncle Frank, Peter's older brother\n* [[Hillary Wolf]] as Megan, Kevin's oldest sister\n* [[John Candy]] as Gus Polinski, polka performer who helps Kate\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Officer Balzak\n* [[Michael C.

Hughes explained that \"I was going away on vacation, and making a list of everything I didn\u2019t want to forget. I thought, 'well, I'd better not forget my kids.' Then I thought, 'what if I left my 10-year-old son at home?

Hughes had promised the studio he could make the movie for no more than $10 million, considerably less than most feature film production budgets of that era. Concerned that the film might exceed that amount, even minimally, and that Warner would insist on keeping to it, Hughes met secretly with [[20th Century Fox]] before production to see if they would be interested in funding the project if Warner proved as inflexible as the producer feared.

A tent town sprang up overnight, as if by \"magic\", thus the city came to be known as the Magic City, and in the next five months, the population increased to over 5,000 residents, further adding to the nickname's validity.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The town site was chosen by the railroad to be placed on the land of then-homesteader [[Erik Ramstad]]. Ramstad was convinced to relinquish his claim, and became one of the city leaders. The town was named after [[Henry Davis Minot|Henry D.

The [[Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad]] (Soo Line) later built a line from [[Valley City, North Dakota|Valley City]] up to Canada. While initially their plan was to cross the [[Mouse River]] at [[Burlington, North Dakota|Burlington]], local interests and arguments convinced them otherwise; landholders along the new route donated the right-of-way. They reached Minot in 1893. \n\nOn July 22, 1920 a tornado passed over Minot and bore down in a coulee three miles southeast of town.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Almanac of North Dakota mysteries & oddities, 2009-2010|last=Jackson|first=William|date=2008|publisher=Valley Star Books|isbn=9780967734989|location=|pages=34|oclc=259419005}}</ref>  The tornado picked up the Andy Botz home and hurled it to the ground, killing Mrs. Botz, breaking Mr. Botz's shoulder, and slightly injuring the two Botz children who were in the house.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nMinot and its surrounding area were wide open throughout 1905\u20131920. The population grew rapidly due to railroad construction and availability of unclaimed land. Nearly complete court records of Ward County and Minot document the prevalence and different types of criminal activity, and offer strong support for the dubious title of \"crime capitol of North Dakota\". State attorney general [[William Langer]] helped clean up the town in 1917\u20131920, but by the time [[Prohibition]] had arrived in the 1920s the city had become a center of illegal activities associated with the [[Downtown Minot#High Third|High Third]] district, which were exacerbated due to the city being a supply hub of [[Al Capone]]'s liquor smuggling operations. The hotbed of alcohol bootlegging, prostitution, and opium dens that sprang up in the Downtown area soon led people to give Minot the nickname \"Little Chicago\". The smugglers used a network of tunnels (some of which were previously built for heating or deliveries) to transport and conceal the illicit cargo entering from Canada.<ref>Michael J. Martin and Glenn H.

In 1969, a severe flood on the [[Mouse River]] devastated the city.

On June 21, 2011, [[KXMC-TV]] reported that a flood of historic proportions was imminent in the Mouse River Valley, largely due to large dam releases upstream. Around 12,000 people were evacuated. On June 26, flooding exceeded previous records when the river crested at 1,561.72 feet above sea level, three feet above the previous record set back in 1881. It is estimated that 20 percent of Minot sustained damage from the flood. This figure includes over 4,100 homes which were in some way affected, 2,376 extensively damaged, and 805 damaged beyond repair.

These divisions are [[North Hill, Minot|North Hill]], the Mouse River Valley and [[South Hill, Minot|South Hill]]. North Hill is the area roughly north of Eleventh Avenue North and Northwest Avenue. South Hill is a broad area south and west of Valley Street and Fifth Avenue South. West of Sixth Street West, South Hill dips sharply to the southwest. The limits of South Hill are less clearly defined than North Hill. Though the neighborhood levels out past Sixteenth Street South, the name South Hill is generally applied to all areas south up to the city limits. Neighborhoods in the Mouse River Valley include [[Bel Air, Minot|Bel Air]], [[Downtown Minot|Downtown]], [[Eastwood Park Historic District|Eastwood Park]], [[Oak Park, Minot, North Dakota|Oak Park]] and [[West Minot]].\n\n===Region===\nMinot is located on the [[Drift Prairie]] of northwestern [[North Dakota]].

The [[Mouse River]], or Souris River, runs through the city west to east.\n\nImportant cities in the region for which Minot is the trading center include [[Burlington, North Dakota|Burlington]], [[Velva, North Dakota|Velva]], [[Garrison, North Dakota|Garrison]], [[Stanley, North Dakota|Stanley]], [[Bottineau, North Dakota|Bottineau]], [[Rugby, North Dakota|Rugby]], and [[New Town, North Dakota|New Town]].\n\nMinot is almost entirely land; the Mouse River, its oxbow lakes, and a few creeks take up just 0.14% of the city's total area.\n\nThe elevation of the river at the city center is {{convert|1,540|ft|m}} [[AMSL|above sea level]].<ref>[[National Weather Service]], Advanced Hydrologic Prediction Service, [http://water.weather.gov/ahps2/hydrograph.php?wfo=bis&gage=mion8&view=1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1%22]</ref>{{Failed verification|date=April 2012}}  The valley sits some {{convert|160|ft|m}} below the surrounding plains; the elevation at the [[Minot International Airport]] on \"North Hill\" is {{convert|1,716|ft|m}}. The city has several small horseshoe-shaped oxbow lakes within its limits near the river, created due to the Mouse's meandering course.\n\n===Grid and address system===\nThe city is laid out on a grid-based street system. Streets run north-south and avenues run east-west. Streets are numbered by their block distance east or west of Main Street. Similarly, Avenues are numbered north and south of Central Avenue. There are four city quadrants (NW, SW, SE, NE) to describe the exact location of any given address. Main Street addresses are simply designated North and South. Central Avenue addresses are simply designated East and West. The grid addressing system carries over into the rural areas of [[Ward County, North Dakota|Ward County]], making the county one of only three that do not follow the statewide grid system in North Dakota (the others being [[Burleigh County]] and [[Grand Forks County]]).\n\n===Mouse River===\nThe [[Mouse River]] divides the city approximately in half, north and south. The valley rises to the plains both north and south of the river. Although there are names for certain features of these hills, such as Anthony Hill on South Hill, there are no general names for these topographical features. The northern rise and the plateau north of it are referred to as '''North Hill''' and the southern rise and plateau south of it are referred to as '''South Hill'''.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130127034902/http://www.kfyrtv.com/News_Stories.asp?news=59204 Castro, Jenny.  \"City Budget Adding Jobs\".

As mayor he chairs the 7-member City Council, but only casts a vote to break a tie. The day-to-day affairs of the city are handled by the City Manager, currently Tom Barry.\n\nMinot uses the [[Council\u2013manager government|Council\u2013manager]] system of government. Seven councilmen are elected from 7 city wards to four-year terms. Elections are arranged such that one councilman from each ward is elected in every even-numbered year. The mayor of Minot is elected to a four-year term as well; the last mayoral election was in 2018. All city offices are nonpartisan.\n\nCity elections are held in June in [[North Dakota]], along with the state [[primary election]].\n\nWhile the city's leadership has been trending towards the conservative, Minot's liberal factions have been active in recent years and have had somewhat more success than in other areas of the state.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Northwest Area Water Supply===\n{{Main|Northwest Area Water Supply}}\nThe Northwest Area Water Supply (NAWS) has had disputes with the Canadian government over a plan calling for water to be pumped from [[Lake Sakakawea]], then to Minot for treatment, and then on to large stretches of Northwest North Dakota.\n\nMinot voters decided in 1998 to levy a 1% sales tax to go towards the construction of NAWS; this tax fund was found in court to have been illegally diverted towards economic development purposes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} A lawsuit was filed against the city and it was ordered to return the misappropriated funds to the NAWS fund.

[[Roosevelt Park Zoo]] is one of the top zoos in the region. Dogs are allowed in Roosevelt Park, a sign is posted at the entrance confirming this. A \"bark park\" for dogs opened in the summer of 2005.\n\nThe [[North Dakota State Fair]] is held in July annually, in Minot. Nearly all recreation areas however are closed during the long winters. The local high school hockey teams use the ice rink located in the Fair Grounds. The ice rink is also turned into the location of the rodeo.\n\nApple Grove Golf Course, and [[Souris Valley Golf Course]] are located in Minot.\n\n===Sports===\n*The Minot Mallards, were a [[Mandak League]] baseball team that played their games at [[Corbett Field (Minot)|Corbett Field]].\n*The [[Minot Minotauros]], an [[North American Hockey League|NAHL]] team, play their games at [[Maysa Arena]].\n*The Minot Muskies, played one season with the [[American West Hockey League]] and played their games at [[All Seasons Arena (Minot)|All Seasons Arena]].\n*The Minot Americans were an SJHL hockey club from 1987 to 1994, playing their games primarily at All Seasons Arena.\n*The Minot Top Guns were an SJHL hockey club from 1994 to 1997, playing their games primarily at All Seasons Arena.\n*Other semi-professional hockey clubs calling Minot home were the Minot Raiders/Rangers ('75-'77) and the Minot Maple Leafs ('85-'86).\n*The [[Minot Skyrockets]], a former [[Continental Basketball Association]] team, played their games at [[Minot Municipal Auditorium]].\n*The [[Minot State Beavers]] play ice hockey at [[All Seasons Arena (Minot)|All Seasons Arena]], baseball at [[Corbett Field (Minot)|Corbett Field]], football at [[Herb Parker Stadium]] and basketball at the [[MSU Dome]].\n*The Mouse River Rollers play roller derby at different locations around the city, including the Maysa Arena.\n* Minot is home to several municipal sports venues including the [[All Seasons Arena (Minot)|All Seasons Arena]], [[Corbett Field (Minot)|Corbett Field]], [[Maysa Arena]] and the [[Minot Municipal Auditorium]].\n\n===Sister cities===\nMinot maintains a [[sister city]] relationship with the [[Norway|Norwegian]] city of [[Skien]].\n\nMinot is also a sister city of [[Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan|Moose Jaw]], [[Saskatchewan]], about {{convert|300|mi|km}} to the north-west. The cities share many qualities, including their size, location on river valleys, historical origins, and air force bases.\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Minot, North Dakota}}\nMinot has several media outlets. [[KMOT-TV]], [[KXMC-TV]] and the [[Minot Daily News]] report on local news daily. KCJB-AM, KHRT-AM, and [[Prairie Public (disambiguation)|Prairie Public]] have some local news content, but no active journalists.\n\n=== Radio ===\nMinot is served by fifteen radio stations (12 FM, 3 AM). [[Bottineau, North Dakota|Bottineau]]-based [[Programmer's Broadcasting]] owns [[KTZU]] and [[KWGO]], along with [[KBTO]] of [[Bottineau, North Dakota|Bottineau]]. [[Prairie Public Radio]] operates [[KMPR]] FM 88.9, a local community broadcaster based in [[Burlington, North Dakota|Burlington]] operates a [[LPFM|low-power]] FM station, and the remainder are nonprofit Christian stations, of which only KHRT is based locally.\n\n[[iHeartMedia]] owns and operates all of the commercial stations licensed to Minot itself: [[KCJB]] 910 (Classic Country & Talk), [[KRRZ]] 1390 (Classic Hits/Talk), [[KYYX]] 97.1 (Country), [[KIZZ]] 93.7 (Top 40), [[KMXA-FM]] 99.9 (AC), and [[KZPR]] 105.3 (Active Rock).

[[Souris River Telecommunications]] provides cable service to other nearby communities.\n\n=== Print ===\nThe principal local newspaper is the ''[[Minot Daily News]]'', which publishes seven days a week. The Minot Air Force Base also has a weekly newspaper printed, [http://www.northernsentry.com The Northern Sentry]. It is a free publication published on Fridays by BHG, Inc. out of Garrison, ND available on the MAFB, as well as the surrounding communities and many locations within Minot. The Minot State University student newspaper ''Red & Green'' is published once a week (Thursdays) during the regular school year, but not during the summer months. Morgan Printing produces the ''Lunch Letter'' three days a week on a double-sided leaflet. There is one weekly classified-ad publication, the ''Trading Post'', printed by the ''Minot Daily News''. The ''[[Bismarck Tribune]]'' is available at several outlets in the city, as is ''[[The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead|The Forum]]'', to a lesser extent.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{unreferenced section|date = September 2016}}\n\n===Railroads===\nThe railroads that built Minot remain, though Great Northern is now part of the [[BNSF Railway]] and the Soo Line is run by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].\n\nPassenger rail transportation is provided daily on [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Empire Builder]]'' line, connecting Chicago with Portland and Seattle, which stops at the [[Minot (Amtrak station)|Minot Amtrak station]]. Trains make a 20-minute refueling and crew change stop in Minot; Westbound trains arrive about 9:00 am [[Central Standard Time Zone|local time]]. Eastbound trains arrive about 9:00 pm.\n\n===Highways===\n[[File:Minotwide.jpg|300 px|thumb|right|US 83 running through north Minot]]\n\nThree major U.S. highways run through the city, connecting it to Canada, Montana, and two interstates: [[U.S. Route 2 in North Dakota|US 2]], [[U.S. Route 52 in North Dakota|US 52]], and [[U.S. Route 83 in North Dakota|US 83]].\n\nUS 2 runs east-west and is a four-lane divided highway from Minot east to [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]] and beyond as well as west to [[Williston, North Dakota|Williston]] and into Montana. Minot is midpoint along the North Dakota segment of US 2.\n\nUS 83 runs north-south through central Minot as [[Broadway (Minot, North Dakota)|Broadway]]. It is a four-lane divided highway from Minot south to [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]] and north to [[Minot AFB, North Dakota|Minot Air Force Base]]. Just north of the main gate at the base, the road reduces to two lanes and crosses the Canada\u2013US border at [[Westhope, North Dakota|Westhope, ND]], where it becomes [[Manitoba]] Highway 83.\n\nUS 52 is a two-lane highway that runs southeast-northwest. Southeast from Minot, it follows a slightly circuitous route to [[Jamestown, North Dakota|Jamestown]]. US 52 then merges with [[Interstate 94]] (I-94) after Jamestown, heading due east to [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]]. Northwest from Minot, US 52 crosses the Canada\u2013US border at [[Portal, North Dakota|Portal, ND]]/North Portal, [[Saskatchewan|SK]], where it becomes [[Saskatchewan Highway 39]].\n\nThe [[Minot Bypass]] follows alternate alignments of these roads around the city in its northwest and northeast quadrants, with southwest and southeast bypasses in preliminary planning stages.\n\n===Airport===\n[[Minot International Airport]] is served by four airlines as well as charters and air taxi service around North Dakota. [[Delta Air Lines]] offers up to six daily round trips to [[Minneapolis International Airport]], offering hundreds of daily connections. [[United Airlines]] offers four daily round trips to its [[Denver International Airport]] hub. [[Allegiant Air]] provides up to four weekly round trips to Las Vegas [[McCarran International Airport]] and up to five weekly round trips to [[Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport]].\n\n===Within the city===\nAutomobiles dominate intracity and local area transport. There is limited fixed-route city transit service ([[Minot City Transit]]) on weekdays, and flexible-route rural transit service ([[Souris Basin Transportation]]) on an occasional basis. Local transit services for the elderly and disabled ([[Minot Commission on Aging Transit]]) meet federal guidelines but have 24-hour advance notice requirements.\n\nPedestrianism in the city is inhibited by several factors; the sidewalk network is poor in many areas of the city, though improving. Automobile drivers take the right of way at all but the best-marked crosswalks, and major points are often separated by relatively large distances and hill slopes. [[Skateboarding]] is illegal in streets and on sidewalks (though there is a skating area in Roosevelt Park), and [[rollerblading]] is generally disallowed by downtown landowners.\n\n==Sites of interest==\n[[File:2009-0521-ND-Minot-ScanHerPark-StaveChurch.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Scandinavian Heritage Park]]\n* [[Arlene Theater]], a performing arts center, where the Mouse River Players perform\n* [[Dakota Territory Air Museum]] is an [[aircraft]] museum near the airport.

A tent town sprang up overnight, as if by \"magic\", thus the city came to be known as the Magic City, and in the next five months, the population increased to over 5,000 residents, further adding to the nickname's validity.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The town site was chosen by the railroad to be placed on the land of then-homesteader [[Erik Ramstad]]. Ramstad was convinced to relinquish his claim, and became one of the city leaders. The town was named after [[Henry Davis Minot|Henry D.

The [[Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad]] (Soo Line) later built a line from [[Valley City, North Dakota|Valley City]] up to Canada. While initially their plan was to cross the [[Mouse River]] at [[Burlington, North Dakota|Burlington]], local interests and arguments convinced them otherwise; landholders along the new route donated the right-of-way. They reached Minot in 1893. \n\nOn July 22, 1920 a tornado passed over Minot and bore down in a coulee three miles southeast of town.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Almanac of North Dakota mysteries & oddities, 2009-2010|last=Jackson|first=William|date=2008|publisher=Valley Star Books|isbn=9780967734989|location=|pages=34|oclc=259419005}}</ref>  The tornado picked up the Andy Botz home and hurled it to the ground, killing Mrs. Botz, breaking Mr. Botz's shoulder, and slightly injuring the two Botz children who were in the house.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\nMinot and its surrounding area were wide open throughout 1905\u20131920. The population grew rapidly due to railroad construction and availability of unclaimed land. Nearly complete court records of Ward County and Minot document the prevalence and different types of criminal activity, and offer strong support for the dubious title of \"crime capitol of North Dakota\". State attorney general [[William Langer]] helped clean up the town in 1917\u20131920, but by the time [[Prohibition]] had arrived in the 1920s the city had become a center of illegal activities associated with the [[Downtown Minot#High Third|High Third]] district, which were exacerbated due to the city being a supply hub of [[Al Capone]]'s liquor smuggling operations. The hotbed of alcohol bootlegging, prostitution, and opium dens that sprang up in the Downtown area soon led people to give Minot the nickname \"Little Chicago\". The smugglers used a network of tunnels (some of which were previously built for heating or deliveries) to transport and conceal the illicit cargo entering from Canada.<ref>Michael J.

On June 21, 2011, [[KXMC-TV]] reported that a flood of historic proportions was imminent in the Mouse River Valley, largely due to large dam releases upstream. Around 12,000 people were evacuated. On June 26, flooding exceeded previous records when the river crested at 1,561.72 feet above sea level, three feet above the previous record set back in 1881. It is estimated that 20 percent of Minot sustained damage from the flood. This figure includes over 4,100 homes which were in some way affected, 2,376 extensively damaged, and 805 damaged beyond repair.

These divisions are [[North Hill, Minot|North Hill]], the Mouse River Valley and [[South Hill, Minot|South Hill]]. North Hill is the area roughly north of Eleventh Avenue North and Northwest Avenue. South Hill is a broad area south and west of Valley Street and Fifth Avenue South. West of Sixth Street West, South Hill dips sharply to the southwest. The limits of South Hill are less clearly defined than North Hill. Though the neighborhood levels out past Sixteenth Street South, the name South Hill is generally applied to all areas south up to the city limits. Neighborhoods in the Mouse River Valley include [[Bel Air, Minot|Bel Air]], [[Downtown Minot|Downtown]], [[Eastwood Park Historic District|Eastwood Park]], [[Oak Park, Minot, North Dakota|Oak Park]] and [[West Minot]].\n\n===Region===\nMinot is located on the [[Drift Prairie]] of northwestern [[North Dakota]].

The city has several small horseshoe-shaped oxbow lakes within its limits near the river, created due to the Mouse's meandering course.\n\n===Grid and address system===\nThe city is laid out on a grid-based street system. Streets run north-south and avenues run east-west. Streets are numbered by their block distance east or west of Main Street. Similarly, Avenues are numbered north and south of Central Avenue. There are four city quadrants (NW, SW, SE, NE) to describe the exact location of any given address. Main Street addresses are simply designated North and South. Central Avenue addresses are simply designated East and West. The grid addressing system carries over into the rural areas of [[Ward County, North Dakota|Ward County]], making the county one of only three that do not follow the statewide grid system in North Dakota (the others being [[Burleigh County]] and [[Grand Forks County]]).\n\n===Mouse River===\nThe [[Mouse River]] divides the city approximately in half, north and south. The valley rises to the plains both north and south of the river. Although there are names for certain features of these hills, such as Anthony Hill on South Hill, there are no general names for these topographical features. The northern rise and the plateau north of it are referred to as '''North Hill''' and the southern rise and plateau south of it are referred to as '''South Hill'''.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130127034902/http://www.kfyrtv.com/News_Stories.asp?news=59204 Castro, Jenny.  \"City Budget Adding Jobs\".

As mayor he chairs the 7-member City Council, but only casts a vote to break a tie. The day-to-day affairs of the city are handled by the City Manager, currently Tom Barry.\n\nMinot uses the [[Council\u2013manager government|Council\u2013manager]] system of government. Seven councilmen are elected from 7 city wards to four-year terms. Elections are arranged such that one councilman from each ward is elected in every even-numbered year. The mayor of Minot is elected to a four-year term as well; the last mayoral election was in 2018. All city offices are nonpartisan.\n\nCity elections are held in June in [[North Dakota]], along with the state [[primary election]].\n\nWhile the city's leadership has been trending towards the conservative, Minot's liberal factions have been active in recent years and have had somewhat more success than in other areas of the state.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\n===Northwest Area Water Supply===\n{{Main|Northwest Area Water Supply}}\nThe Northwest Area Water Supply (NAWS) has had disputes with the Canadian government over a plan calling for water to be pumped from [[Lake Sakakawea]], then to Minot for treatment, and then on to large stretches of Northwest North Dakota.\n\nMinot voters decided in 1998 to levy a 1% sales tax to go towards the construction of NAWS; this tax fund was found in court to have been illegally diverted towards economic development purposes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} A lawsuit was filed against the city and it was ordered to return the misappropriated funds to the NAWS fund.

[[Roosevelt Park Zoo]] is one of the top zoos in the region. Dogs are allowed in Roosevelt Park, a sign is posted at the entrance confirming this. A \"bark park\" for dogs opened in the summer of 2005.\n\nThe [[North Dakota State Fair]] is held in July annually, in Minot. Nearly all recreation areas however are closed during the long winters. The local high school hockey teams use the ice rink located in the Fair Grounds. The ice rink is also turned into the location of the rodeo.\n\nApple Grove Golf Course, and [[Souris Valley Golf Course]] are located in Minot.\n\n===Sports===\n*The Minot Mallards, were a [[Mandak League]] baseball team that played their games at [[Corbett Field (Minot)|Corbett Field]].\n*The [[Minot Minotauros]], an [[North American Hockey League|NAHL]] team, play their games at [[Maysa Arena]].\n*The Minot Muskies, played one season with the [[American West Hockey League]] and played their games at [[All Seasons Arena (Minot)|All Seasons Arena]].\n*The Minot Americans were an SJHL hockey club from 1987 to 1994, playing their games primarily at All Seasons Arena.\n*The Minot Top Guns were an SJHL hockey club from 1994 to 1997, playing their games primarily at All Seasons Arena.\n*Other semi-professional hockey clubs calling Minot home were the Minot Raiders/Rangers ('75-'77) and the Minot Maple Leafs ('85-'86).\n*The [[Minot Skyrockets]], a former [[Continental Basketball Association]] team, played their games at [[Minot Municipal Auditorium]].\n*The [[Minot State Beavers]] play ice hockey at [[All Seasons Arena (Minot)|All Seasons Arena]], baseball at [[Corbett Field (Minot)|Corbett Field]], football at [[Herb Parker Stadium]] and basketball at the [[MSU Dome]].\n*The Mouse River Rollers play roller derby at different locations around the city, including the Maysa Arena.\n* Minot is home to several municipal sports venues including the [[All Seasons Arena (Minot)|All Seasons Arena]], [[Corbett Field (Minot)|Corbett Field]], [[Maysa Arena]] and the [[Minot Municipal Auditorium]].\n\n===Sister cities===\nMinot maintains a [[sister city]] relationship with the [[Norway|Norwegian]] city of [[Skien]].\n\nMinot is also a sister city of [[Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan|Moose Jaw]], [[Saskatchewan]], about {{convert|300|mi|km}} to the north-west. The cities share many qualities, including their size, location on river valleys, historical origins, and air force bases.\n\n==Media==\n{{Main|Media in Minot, North Dakota}}\nMinot has several media outlets. [[KMOT-TV]], [[KXMC-TV]] and the [[Minot Daily News]] report on local news daily. KCJB-AM, KHRT-AM, and [[Prairie Public (disambiguation)|Prairie Public]] have some local news content, but no active journalists.\n\n=== Radio ===\nMinot is served by fifteen radio stations (12 FM, 3 AM). [[Bottineau, North Dakota|Bottineau]]-based [[Programmer's Broadcasting]] owns [[KTZU]] and [[KWGO]], along with [[KBTO]] of [[Bottineau, North Dakota|Bottineau]]. [[Prairie Public Radio]] operates [[KMPR]] FM 88.9, a local community broadcaster based in [[Burlington, North Dakota|Burlington]] operates a [[LPFM|low-power]] FM station, and the remainder are nonprofit Christian stations, of which only KHRT is based locally.\n\n[[iHeartMedia]] owns and operates all of the commercial stations licensed to Minot itself: [[KCJB]] 910 (Classic Country & Talk), [[KRRZ]] 1390 (Classic Hits/Talk), [[KYYX]] 97.1 (Country), [[KIZZ]] 93.7 (Top 40), [[KMXA-FM]] 99.9 (AC), and [[KZPR]] 105.3 (Active Rock).

[[Souris River Telecommunications]] provides cable service to other nearby communities.\n\n=== Print ===\nThe principal local newspaper is the ''[[Minot Daily News]]'', which publishes seven days a week. The Minot Air Force Base also has a weekly newspaper printed, [http://www.northernsentry.com The Northern Sentry]. It is a free publication published on Fridays by BHG, Inc. out of Garrison, ND available on the MAFB, as well as the surrounding communities and many locations within Minot. The Minot State University student newspaper ''Red & Green'' is published once a week (Thursdays) during the regular school year, but not during the summer months. Morgan Printing produces the ''Lunch Letter'' three days a week on a double-sided leaflet. There is one weekly classified-ad publication, the ''Trading Post'', printed by the ''Minot Daily News''. The ''[[Bismarck Tribune]]'' is available at several outlets in the city, as is ''[[The Forum of Fargo-Moorhead|The Forum]]'', to a lesser extent.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{unreferenced section|date = September 2016}}\n\n===Railroads===\nThe railroads that built Minot remain, though Great Northern is now part of the [[BNSF Railway]] and the Soo Line is run by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]].\n\nPassenger rail transportation is provided daily on [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[Empire Builder]]'' line, connecting Chicago with Portland and Seattle, which stops at the [[Minot (Amtrak station)|Minot Amtrak station]]. Trains make a 20-minute refueling and crew change stop in Minot; Westbound trains arrive about 9:00 am [[Central Standard Time Zone|local time]]. Eastbound trains arrive about 9:00 pm.\n\n===Highways===\n[[File:Minotwide.jpg|300 px|thumb|right|US 83 running through north Minot]]\n\nThree major U.S. highways run through the city, connecting it to Canada, Montana, and two interstates: [[U.S. Route 2 in North Dakota|US 2]], [[U.S. Route 52 in North Dakota|US 52]], and [[U.S. Route 83 in North Dakota|US 83]].\n\nUS 2 runs east-west and is a four-lane divided highway from Minot east to [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]] and beyond as well as west to [[Williston, North Dakota|Williston]] and into Montana. Minot is midpoint along the North Dakota segment of US 2.\n\nUS 83 runs north-south through central Minot as [[Broadway (Minot, North Dakota)|Broadway]]. It is a four-lane divided highway from Minot south to [[Bismarck, North Dakota|Bismarck]] and north to [[Minot AFB, North Dakota|Minot Air Force Base]]. Just north of the main gate at the base, the road reduces to two lanes and crosses the Canada\u2013US border at [[Westhope, North Dakota|Westhope, ND]], where it becomes [[Manitoba]] Highway 83.\n\nUS 52 is a two-lane highway that runs southeast-northwest. Southeast from Minot, it follows a slightly circuitous route to [[Jamestown, North Dakota|Jamestown]]. US 52 then merges with [[Interstate 94]] (I-94) after Jamestown, heading due east to [[Fargo, North Dakota|Fargo]]. Northwest from Minot, US 52 crosses the Canada\u2013US border at [[Portal, North Dakota|Portal, ND]]/North Portal, [[Saskatchewan|SK]], where it becomes [[Saskatchewan Highway 39]].\n\nThe [[Minot Bypass]] follows alternate alignments of these roads around the city in its northwest and northeast quadrants, with southwest and southeast bypasses in preliminary planning stages.\n\n===Airport===\n[[Minot International Airport]] is served by four airlines as well as charters and air taxi service around North Dakota. [[Delta Air Lines]] offers up to six daily round trips to [[Minneapolis International Airport]], offering hundreds of daily connections. [[United Airlines]] offers four daily round trips to its [[Denver International Airport]] hub. [[Allegiant Air]] provides up to four weekly round trips to Las Vegas [[McCarran International Airport]] and up to five weekly round trips to [[Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport]].\n\n===Within the city===\nAutomobiles dominate intracity and local area transport. There is limited fixed-route city transit service ([[Minot City Transit]]) on weekdays, and flexible-route rural transit service ([[Souris Basin Transportation]]) on an occasional basis. Local transit services for the elderly and disabled ([[Minot Commission on Aging Transit]]) meet federal guidelines but have 24-hour advance notice requirements.\n\nPedestrianism in the city is inhibited by several factors; the sidewalk network is poor in many areas of the city, though improving. Automobile drivers take the right of way at all but the best-marked crosswalks, and major points are often separated by relatively large distances and hill slopes. [[Skateboarding]] is illegal in streets and on sidewalks (though there is a skating area in Roosevelt Park), and [[rollerblading]] is generally disallowed by downtown landowners.\n\n==Sites of interest==\n[[File:2009-0521-ND-Minot-ScanHerPark-StaveChurch.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Scandinavian Heritage Park]]\n* [[Arlene Theater]], a performing arts center, where the Mouse River Players perform\n* [[Dakota Territory Air Museum]] is an [[aircraft]] museum near the airport.

It also hosts rodeos, and college hockey games.\n* [[Roosevelt Park (Minot)|Roosevelt Park]] and [[Roosevelt Park Zoo|Zoo]]\n* [[Taube Museum of Art]], located in the 1906 Union National Bank Building, features exhibit space in the Main Gallery and the Lower Gallery, which change every four to six weeks.\n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- Note:\n\u00b7 Only people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here.
