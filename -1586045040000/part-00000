The document further reveals that \"Ethiopia is one of the most malaria-prone countries in Africa, with rates of morbidity and mortality increasing dramatically (i.e. 3.5-fold) during epidemics\".

The magazine said Tedros put people at the center of his policies again as Minister of Foreign Affairs and mentioned his massive social media followers.

In addition to these challenges, the National Malaria Guideline stresses once again, \"serious problems in coordinating health interventions and implementing partners\".\n\n==== AIDS ====\nUnder Tedros, the Ministry of Health was able to turn around Ethiopia's record of the highest number of new HIV infections in Africa, bringing the number down dramatically.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> The prevalence was reduced from its double digit record to 4.2 in cities and 0.6 in rural areas.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> According to the HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Office (HAPCO) said the rate of HIV infection in Ethiopia has declined by 90% between 2002 and 2012, while the rate AIDS-related death has dropped by 53%.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> The number of people starting HIV treatment increased more than 150-fold during 2005\u20132008.<ref name=\"Yale\" />\n\nThe decline in the infection rate has been attributed to the concerted effort of the Ministry of Health in providing medicines and organizing various awareness-raising programs.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> The office has managed to integrate the people in HIV prevention and control activities. The wide range of media campaigns to inform the public about the disease has definitely paid off as it has helped achieve behavioral change. Prevention measures like the use of condoms have shot up starkly with increased awareness on the disease and advertising urging [[safe sex]] practices and condom use.<ref name=\"AIGA\" /> The government's collaboration with local and international governmental and nongovernmental organizations has also positively influenced access to HIV/AIDS related service centers.<ref name=\"AIGA\" />\n\n=== Family planning ===\nUnder Tedros' tenure, the unmet need for family planning in Ethiopia has declined, and the contraceptive prevalence rate has doubled in 5 years. Based on the current trends, contraceptive prevalence rates will reach 65% by 2015 by reaching additional 6.2&nbsp;million women and adolescent girls.<ref name=\"AllAfrica\">{{cite news |title=Ethiopia: Speech By Ethiopia's Minister of Health at the London Summit On Family Planning |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201207111108.html?page=2 |accessdate=18 June 2013 |newspaper=AllAfrica |date=11 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307081907/http://allafrica.com/stories/201207111108.html?page=2 |archive-date=7 March 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> Recognising that early childrearing is a major factor in infant mortality, the Ministry of Health is targeting its efforts on adolescent girls (15 to 19 years) who have the highest unmet need for family planning.<ref name=\"AllAfrica\" />\n\n=== Criticism and scandal ===\nIn May 2017, just prior to the WHO election, stories surfaced about an alleged cover-up of three possible cholera epidemics in Ethiopia in 2006, 2009 and 2011.

Some of those who wrote in Pashto are [[Pir Roshan|Bayazid Pir Roshan]] (a major inventor of the [[Pashto alphabet]]), [[Khushal Khan Khattak]], [[Rahman Baba]], [[Nazo Tokhi]], and [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], founder of the modern state of Afghanistan or the [[Durrani Empire]].\n\nIn modern times, noticing the incursion of Persian and Arabic vocabulary, there is a strong desire to \"[[Linguistic purism|purify]]\" Pashto by restoring its old vocabulary.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fdTJgCSPsGwC&pg=PA89&lpg=PA89&dq=pashto+purification#v=onepage&q=pashto%20purification&f=false |title=Afghanistan 101: Understanding Afghan Culture |author=Ehsan M Entezar |page=89 |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4257-9302-9}}</ref>{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}<ref name=\"BensonKosonen2013\">{{cite book|author1=Carol Benson|author2=Kimmo Kosonen|title=Language Issues in Comparative Education: Inclusive Teaching and Learning in Non-Dominant Languages and Cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tdREAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA64|date=13 June 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-218-1|pages=64\u2013}}</ref><ref>[http://www.hewad.com/mohammadgul/ Muhammad Gul Khan Momand], Hew\u0101d Afghanistan</ref>\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main article|Pashto grammar}}\nPashto is a [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb]] (SOV) language with [[split ergativity]]. [[Adjective]]s come before [[noun]]s. Nouns and adjectives are [[inflection|inflected]] for two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masc./fem.),<ref>Emeneau, M. B. (1962) \"Bilingualism and Structural Borrowing\" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 106(5): pp. 430\u2013442, p. 441</ref> two [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (sing./plur.), and four [[Grammatical case|cases]] (direct, oblique I, oblique II and vocative). There is also an inflection for the [[subjunctive mood]]. The [[verb]] system is very intricate with the following tenses: present, simple past, past progressive, present perfect, and past perfect. The sentence construction of Pashto has similarities with some other Indo-Iranian languages such as [[Prakrit]] and [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]]. The possessor precedes the possessed in the genitive construction. The verb generally agrees with the subject in both transitive and intransitive sentences. An exception occurs when a completed action is reported in any of the past tenses (simple past, past progressive, present perfect, or past perfect). In such cases, the verb agrees with the subject if it is intransitive, but if it is transitive, it agrees with the object,<ref name=\"Pashto-language\"/> therefore Pashto shows a partly [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative]] behaviour. Like [[Kurdish grammar|Kurdish]], but unlike most other Indo-Iranian languages, Pashto uses all three types of [[adpositional phrase|adpositions]] \u2013 prepositions, postpositions, and circumpositions.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main article|Pashto phonology}}\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!

In particular, the retroflex fricatives, which represent the original pronunciation of these sounds, are preserved in the southern/southwestern dialects (especially the prestige dialect of [[Kandahar]]), while they are pronounced as palatal fricatives in the west-central dialects. Other dialects merge the original retroflexes with other existing sounds: The southeastern dialects merge them with the [[Postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] fricatives {{IPA|/\u0283, \u0292/}}, while the northern/northeastern dialects merge them with the [[Velar consonant|velar]] phonemes in an asymmetric pattern, pronouncing them as {{IPA|/x, \u0261/}} ('''not''' {{IPA|/\u0263/}}). Furthermore, according to Henderson (1983),<ref name=\"Henderson 1983\"/> the west-central [[voiced palatal fricative]] {{IPA|/\u029d/}} actually occurs only in the [[Wardak Province]], and is merged into {{IPA|/\u0261/}} elsewhere in the region.\n\nThe [[velar]]s {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x, \u0263/}} followed by the [[close back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/u/}} assimilate into the [[Labialisation|labialized]] velars {{IPA|[k\u02b7, \u0261\u02b7, x\u02b7, \u0263\u02b7]}}.\n\nVoiceless stops {{IPA|[p, t, t\u0361\u0283, k]}} are all [[Aspirated consonant|unaspirated]], like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], other [[Romance languages]], and [[Austronesian languages]]; they have slightly [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] allophones prevocalically in a stressed syllable.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nIn Pashto, most of the native elements of the lexicon are related to other [[Eastern Iranian languages]].

and the \"hard\" northern variety ''Pax\u030ct\u014d'' (Pakhtu).<ref name=\"T&F\"/> Each variety is further divided into a number of dialects. The southern dialect of [[Wanetsi]] is the most distinctive Pashto dialect.\n\n1.

Written Pashto literature saw a rise in development in the 17th century mostly due to poets like [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] (1613\u20131689), who, along with [[Rahman Baba]] (1650\u20131715), is widely regarded as among the greatest Pashto poets. From the time of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] (1722\u20131772), Pashto has been the language of the court. The first Pashto teaching text was written during the period of Ahmad Shah Durrani by Pir Mohammad Kakar with the title of ''Ma\u02bfrifat al-Afgh\u0101n\u012b'' (\"The Knowledge of Afghani [Pashto]\"). After that, the first grammar book of Pashto [[verb]]s was written in 1805 under the title of ''Riy\u0101\u017c al-Ma\u1e25abbah'' (\"Training in Affection\") through the patronage of Nawab Mahabat Khan, son of [[Hafiz Rahmat Khan]], chief of the [[Barech]]. Nawabullah Yar Khan, another son of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, in 1808 wrote a book of Pashto words entitled ''\u02bfAj\u0101yib al-Lugh\u0101t'' (\"Wonders of Languages\").\n\n===Poetry example===\nAn excerpt from the ''Kal\u0101m'' of [[Rahman Baba]]:\n\n{{lang|ps|2=\n\u0632\u06c0 \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06c0 \u062e\u067e\u0644\u0647 \u06ab\u0631\u0645 \u064a\u0645  \u0686\u06d0 \u0645\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0645<br />\n\u0686\u06d0 \u062f\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u067c\u0648\u067e\u0646 \u0645\u06d0 \u0628\u0648\u0644\u064a \u06ab\u0631\u0645 \u067e\u0647 \u0685\u06c0\n}}\n\n'''IPA:''' ''Z\u0259 ra.m\u0251n p\u0259 xp\u0259l.a gram j\u0259m t\u0361\u0283e ma.j\u0259n j\u0259m''<br />\n''t\u0361\u0283e d\u032a\u0251 nor \u0288o.pan me bo.li gram p\u0259 t\u0361s\u0259''\n\n'''Transliteration:''' ''Z\u0259 Rahm\u0101n p\u0259 xp\u0259la gram y\u0259m \u010de may\u0259n y\u0259m''<br />\n''\u010ce d\u0101 nor \u1e6dopan me boli gram p\u0259 ts\u0259''\n\n'''Translation:''' \"I Rahman, myself am guilty that I am a lover,<br />\nOn what does this other universe call me guilty.\"\n\n===Proverbs===\nPashto also has a rich heritage of proverbs (Pashto ''matal\u016bna'', sg.

[[Adjective]]s come before [[noun]]s. Nouns and adjectives are [[inflection|inflected]] for two [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masc./fem.),<ref>Emeneau, M. B. (1962) \"Bilingualism and Structural Borrowing\" ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'' 106(5): pp. 430\u2013442, p. 441</ref> two [[Grammatical number|numbers]] (sing./plur.), and four [[Grammatical case|cases]] (direct, oblique I, oblique II and vocative). There is also an inflection for the [[subjunctive mood]]. The [[verb]] system is very intricate with the following tenses: present, simple past, past progressive, present perfect, and past perfect. The sentence construction of Pashto has similarities with some other Indo-Iranian languages such as [[Prakrit]] and [[Bactrian language|Bactrian]]. The possessor precedes the possessed in the genitive construction. The verb generally agrees with the subject in both transitive and intransitive sentences. An exception occurs when a completed action is reported in any of the past tenses (simple past, past progressive, present perfect, or past perfect). In such cases, the verb agrees with the subject if it is intransitive, but if it is transitive, it agrees with the object,<ref name=\"Pashto-language\"/> therefore Pashto shows a partly [[ergative-absolutive language|ergative]] behaviour. Like [[Kurdish grammar|Kurdish]], but unlike most other Indo-Iranian languages, Pashto uses all three types of [[adpositional phrase|adpositions]] \u2013 prepositions, postpositions, and circumpositions.\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Main article|Pashto phonology}}\n\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n!

In particular, the retroflex fricatives, which represent the original pronunciation of these sounds, are preserved in the southern/southwestern dialects (especially the prestige dialect of [[Kandahar]]), while they are pronounced as palatal fricatives in the west-central dialects. Other dialects merge the original retroflexes with other existing sounds: The southeastern dialects merge them with the [[Postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]] fricatives {{IPA|/\u0283, \u0292/}}, while the northern/northeastern dialects merge them with the [[Velar consonant|velar]] phonemes in an asymmetric pattern, pronouncing them as {{IPA|/x, \u0261/}} ('''not''' {{IPA|/\u0263/}}). Furthermore, according to Henderson (1983),<ref name=\"Henderson 1983\"/> the west-central [[voiced palatal fricative]] {{IPA|/\u029d/}} actually occurs only in the [[Wardak Province]], and is merged into {{IPA|/\u0261/}} elsewhere in the region.\n\nThe [[velar]]s {{IPA|/k, \u0261, x, \u0263/}} followed by the [[close back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/u/}} assimilate into the [[Labialisation|labialized]] velars {{IPA|[k\u02b7, \u0261\u02b7, x\u02b7, \u0263\u02b7]}}.\n\nVoiceless stops {{IPA|[p, t, t\u0361\u0283, k]}} are all [[Aspirated consonant|unaspirated]], like [[Spanish language|Spanish]], other [[Romance languages]], and [[Austronesian languages]]; they have slightly [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] allophones prevocalically in a stressed syllable.\n\n==Vocabulary==\nIn Pashto, most of the native elements of the lexicon are related to other [[Eastern Iranian languages]].

and the \"hard\" northern variety ''Pax\u030ct\u014d'' (Pakhtu).<ref name=\"T&F\"/> Each variety is further divided into a number of dialects.

Written Pashto literature saw a rise in development in the 17th century mostly due to poets like [[Khushal Khan Khattak]] (1613\u20131689), who, along with [[Rahman Baba]] (1650\u20131715), is widely regarded as among the greatest Pashto poets. From the time of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] (1722\u20131772), Pashto has been the language of the court. The first Pashto teaching text was written during the period of Ahmad Shah Durrani by Pir Mohammad Kakar with the title of ''Ma\u02bfrifat al-Afgh\u0101n\u012b'' (\"The Knowledge of Afghani [Pashto]\"). After that, the first grammar book of Pashto [[verb]]s was written in 1805 under the title of ''Riy\u0101\u017c al-Ma\u1e25abbah'' (\"Training in Affection\") through the patronage of Nawab Mahabat Khan, son of [[Hafiz Rahmat Khan]], chief of the [[Barech]]. Nawabullah Yar Khan, another son of Hafiz Rahmat Khan, in 1808 wrote a book of Pashto words entitled ''\u02bfAj\u0101yib al-Lugh\u0101t'' (\"Wonders of Languages\").\n\n===Poetry example===\nAn excerpt from the ''Kal\u0101m'' of [[Rahman Baba]]:\n\n{{lang|ps|2=\n\u0632\u06c0 \u0631\u062d\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u06c0 \u062e\u067e\u0644\u0647 \u06ab\u0631\u0645 \u064a\u0645  \u0686\u06d0 \u0645\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u0645<br />\n\u0686\u06d0 \u062f\u0627 \u0646\u0648\u0631 \u067c\u0648\u067e\u0646 \u0645\u06d0 \u0628\u0648\u0644\u064a \u06ab\u0631\u0645 \u067e\u0647 \u0685\u06c0\n}}\n\n'''IPA:''' ''Z\u0259 ra.m\u0251n p\u0259 xp\u0259l.a gram j\u0259m t\u0361\u0283e ma.j\u0259n j\u0259m''<br />\n''t\u0361\u0283e d\u032a\u0251 nor \u0288o.pan me bo.li gram p\u0259 t\u0361s\u0259''\n\n'''Transliteration:''' ''Z\u0259 Rahm\u0101n p\u0259 xp\u0259la gram y\u0259m \u010de may\u0259n y\u0259m''<br />\n''\u010ce d\u0101 nor \u1e6dopan me boli gram p\u0259 ts\u0259''\n\n'''Translation:''' \"I Rahman, myself am guilty that I am a lover,<br />\nOn what does this other universe call me guilty.\"\n\n===Proverbs===\nPashto also has a rich heritage of proverbs (Pashto ''matal\u016bna'', sg.
