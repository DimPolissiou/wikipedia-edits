The light is coming from the left making the bodies look like the waxing crescent moon.]]\n[[Neptune]] has 14 known [[natural satellite|moons]], which are named for minor [[List of water deities|water deities]] in [[Greek mythology]]. By far the largest of them is [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], discovered by [[William Lassell]] on October 10, 1846, 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself; over a century passed before the discovery of the second natural satellite, [[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]]. Neptune's outermost moon [[Neso (moon)|Neso]], which has an orbital period of about 26 [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian years]], orbits further from its planet than any other moon in the [[Solar System]].<ref>http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_elem#neptune (as of Dec-2014)</ref>\n\nTriton is unique among moons of [[Planet#Planetary-mass objects|planetary mass]] in that its orbit is [[Retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde]] to Neptune's rotation and [[Orbital inclination|inclined]] relative to Neptune's equator, which suggests that it did not form in orbit around Neptune but was instead gravitationally captured by it. The next-largest irregular satellite in the [[Solar System]], [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]], has only 0.03% of Triton's mass. The capture of Triton, probably occurring some time after Neptune formed a satellite system, was a catastrophic event for Neptune's original satellites, disrupting their orbits so that they collided to form a rubble disc. Triton is massive enough to have achieved [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] and to retain a thin atmosphere capable of forming clouds and hazes.\n\nInward of Triton are seven small [[regular moon|regular satellites]], all of which have [[Retrograde and prograde motion|prograde orbits]] in planes that lie close to Neptune's equatorial plane; some of these orbit among [[Rings of Neptune|Neptune's rings]]. The largest of them is [[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]]. They were re-accreted from the rubble disc generated after Triton's capture after the Tritonian orbit became circular. Neptune also has six more outer [[irregular satellite]]s other than Triton, including Nereid, whose orbits are much farther from Neptune and at high inclination: three of these have prograde orbits, while the remainder have retrograde orbits. In particular, Nereid has an unusually close and eccentric orbit for an irregular satellite, suggesting that it may have once been a regular satellite that was significantly perturbed to its current position when Triton was captured. The two outermost Neptunian irregular satellites, [[Psamathe (moon)|Psamathe]] and [[Neso (moon)|Neso]], have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered in the Solar System to date.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tritonian sky.jpg|thumb|Simulated view of Neptune in the [[Extraterrestrial skies|hypothetical sky]] of Triton]]\n\n===Discovery===\n[[Triton (moon)|Triton]] was discovered by [[William Lassell]] in 1846, just seventeen days after the [[discovery of Neptune]].<ref name=Lassell1846/> [[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]] was discovered by [[Gerard Kuiper|Gerard P. Kuiper]] in 1949.<ref name=Kuiper1949/> The third moon, later named [[Larissa (moon)|Larissa]], was first observed by Harold J. Reitsema, William B. Hubbard, Larry A. Lebofsky and [[David J. Tholen]] on May 24, 1981. The astronomers were observing a star's close approach to Neptune, looking for rings similar to [[Rings of Uranus|those discovered around Uranus]] four years earlier.<ref name=\"Reitsema1982\"/> If rings were present, the star's luminosity would decrease slightly just before the planet's closest approach. The star's luminosity dipped only for several seconds, which meant that it was due to a moon rather than a ring.\n\nNo further moons were found until ''[[Voyager 2]]'' flew by Neptune in 1989. ''Voyager 2'' rediscovered Larissa and discovered five inner moons: [[Naiad (moon)|Naiad]], [[Thalassa (moon)|Thalassa]], [[Despina (moon)|Despina]], [[Galatea (moon)|Galatea]] and [[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]].<ref name=\"Smith1989\"/> In 2001 two surveys using large ground-based telescopes found five additional outer moons, bringing the total to thirteen.<ref name=\"HolmanKavelaarsGrav2004\"/> Follow-up surveys by two teams in 2002 and 2003 respectively re-observed all five of these moons, which are [[Halimede (moon)|Halimede]], [[Sao (moon)|Sao]], [[Psamathe (moon)|Psamathe]], [[Laomedeia]], and [[Neso (moon)|Neso]].<ref name=\"HolmanKavelaarsGrav2004\"/><ref name=\"SheppardJewittKleyna2006\"/> A sixth candidate moon was also found in the 2002 survey and was lost thereafter: it may have been a [[centaur (minor planet)|centaur]] instead of a satellite, although its small amount of motion relative to Neptune over a month suggests that it was indeed a satellite.<ref name=\"HolmanKavelaarsGrav2004\"/> It was estimated to have a diameter of  33&nbsp;km and to have been about 25.1&nbsp;million&nbsp;km (0.168&nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]]) from Neptune when it was found.<ref name=\"HolmanKavelaarsGrav2004\" />\n\n[[Mark Showalter]] discovered [[Hippocamp (moon)|Hippocamp]] on 1 July 2013 while examining Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of Neptune's [[Rings of Neptune#Adams ring|ring arcs]] from 2009.

The first group includes the seven inner moons, which follow circular prograde orbits lying in the equatorial plane of Neptune. The second group consists of all seven other moons including Triton. They generally follow inclined eccentric and often retrograde orbits far from Neptune; the only exception is Triton, which orbits close to the planet following a circular orbit, though retrograde and inclined.<ref name=\"Jewitt2007\"/>\n[[File:Proteus 3D model.ogv|thumb|Animated three-dimensional model of Proteus|left|alt=An irregularly shaped body rotates around a vertical axis.]]\n[[File:Neptune's Dynamic Environment.webm|thumb|A time-lapse video depicting orbits of Neptune's moons: Triton, Proteus, Larissa, Galatea and Despina.]]\n\n===Regular moons===\nIn order of distance from Neptune, the regular moons are [[Naiad (moon)|Naiad]], [[Thalassa (moon)|Thalassa]], [[Despina (moon)|Despina]], [[Galatea (moon)|Galatea]], [[Larissa (moon)|Larissa]], [[Hippocamp (moon)|Hippocamp]], and [[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]].

Naiad, the closest regular moon, is also the second smallest among the inner moons (following the discovery of Hippocamp), whereas Proteus is the largest regular moon and the second largest moon of Neptune. The first five moons orbit much faster than Neptune's rotation itself ranging from 7 hours for [[Naiad (moon)|Naiad]] and [[Thalassa (moon)|Thalassa]], to 13 hours for [[Larissa (moon)|Larissa]].\n\nThe inner moons are closely associated with [[Rings of Neptune|Neptune's rings]]. The two innermost satellites, Naiad and Thalassa, orbit between the [[Rings of Neptune#Inner rings|Galle]] and [[Rings of Neptune#Inner rings|LeVerrier rings]].<ref name=\"Smith1989\" /> Despina may be a [[shepherd moon]] of the LeVerrier ring, because its orbit lies just inside this ring.<ref name=Miner2007b/> The next moon, [[Galatea (moon)|Galatea]], orbits just inside the most prominent of Neptune's rings, the [[Adams ring]].<ref name=Miner2007b/> This ring is very narrow, with a width not exceeding 50&nbsp;km,<ref name=Horn1990/> and has five embedded bright [[arc (geometry)|arcs]].<ref name=Miner2007b/> The gravity of Galatea helps confine the ring particles within a limited region in the radial direction, maintaining the narrow ring. Various [[orbital resonance|resonances]] between the ring particles and Galatea may also have a role in maintaining the arcs.<ref name=Miner2007b/>\n\nOnly the two largest regular moons have been imaged with a resolution sufficient to discern their shapes and surface features.<ref name=\"Smith1989\" /> Larissa, about 200&nbsp;km in diameter, is elongated. Proteus is not significantly elongated, but not fully spherical either:<ref name=\"Smith1989\" /> it resembles an irregular [[polyhedron]], with several flat or slightly [[Curved mirror#Concave mirrors|concave]] facets 150 to 250&nbsp;km in diameter.<ref name=\"Stooke1994\" /> At about 400&nbsp;km in diameter, it is larger than the Saturnian moon [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], which is fully ellipsoidal. This difference may be due to a past collisional disruption of Proteus.<ref name=BanfieldMurray/> The surface of Proteus is heavily cratered and shows a number of linear features. Its largest crater, Pharos, is more than 150&nbsp;km in diameter.<ref name=\"Smith1989\" /><ref name=\"Stooke1994\" />\n\nAll of Neptune's inner moons are dark objects: their [[geometric albedo]] ranges from 7 to 10%.<ref name=Karkoschka2003/> Their [[spectrum|spectra]] indicate that they are made from water ice contaminated by some very dark material, probably complex [[organic compound]]s.<!---{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}---> In this respect, the inner Neptunian moons are similar to the inner [[moons of Uranus|Uranian moons]].<ref name=\"Smith1989\" />\n\n===Irregular moons===\n[[File:TheIrregulars NEPTUNE.svg|thumb|300px|The diagram illustrates the orbits of Neptune's [[irregular moon]]s excluding Triton.

The X axis is labeled in [[Gigametre|Gm]] and the fraction of the [[Hill sphere]]'s radius.]]\n\nIn order of their distance from the planet, the irregular moons are [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], [[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]], [[Halimede (moon)|Halimede]], [[Sao (moon)|Sao]], [[Laomedeia]], [[Psamathe (moon)|Psamathe]], and [[Neso (moon)|Neso]], a group that includes both prograde and retrograde objects.<ref name=\"Jewitt2007\" /> The five outermost moons are similar to the irregular moons of other [[giant planet]]s, and are thought to have been gravitationally captured by Neptune, unlike the regular satellites, which probably formed ''[[in situ]]''.<ref name=\"SheppardJewittKleyna2006\" />\n\nTriton and Nereid are unusual irregular satellites and are thus treated separately from the other five irregular Neptunian moons, which are more like the outer irregular satellites of the other outer planets.<ref name=\"SheppardJewittKleyna2006\" /> Firstly, they are the largest two known irregular moons in the Solar System, with Triton being almost an [[order of magnitude]] larger than all other known irregular moons. Secondly, they both have atypically small semi-major axes, with Triton's being over an order of magnitude smaller than those of all other known irregular moons. Thirdly, they both have unusual orbital eccentricities: Nereid has one of the most eccentric orbits of any known irregular satellite, and Triton's orbit is a nearly perfect circle. Finally, Nereid also has the lowest inclination of any known irregular satellite.<ref name=\"SheppardJewittKleyna2006\"/>\n\n====Triton====\n{{Main|Triton (moon)}}\n[[File:Triton orbit & Neptune.png|300px|thumbnail|right|The orbit of [[Triton (moon)|Triton]] (red) is different from most moons' orbit (green) in the orbit's direction, and the orbit is [[Orbital inclination|tilted \u221223\u00b0]].]]\nTriton follows a retrograde and quasi-circular orbit, and is thought to be a gravitationally captured satellite. It was the second moon in the Solar System that was discovered to have a substantial [[atmosphere]], which is primarily [[nitrogen]] with small amounts of [[methane]] and [[carbon monoxide]].<ref name=\"ElliotStrobelZhu_2000\" /> The pressure on Triton's surface is about 14&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|\u03bcbar]].<ref name=\"ElliotStrobelZhu_2000\" /> In 1989 the ''Voyager 2'' spacecraft observed what appeared to be clouds and hazes in this thin atmosphere.<ref name=\"Smith1989\" /> Triton is one of the coldest bodies in the Solar System, with a surface temperature of about {{convert|38|K|C}}.<ref name=\"ElliotStrobelZhu_2000\" /> Its surface is covered by nitrogen, methane, [[carbon dioxide]] and water [[volatiles|ices]]<ref name=Cruikshank1993/> and has a high [[geometric albedo]] of more than 70%.<ref name=\"Smith1989\" /> The [[Bond albedo]] is even higher, reaching up to 90%.<ref name=\"Smith1989\" /><ref group=\"note\">The geometric albedo of an astronomical body is the ratio of its actual brightness at zero [[Phase angle (astronomy)|phase angle]] (i.e. as seen from the light source) to that of an idealized flat, fully reflecting, [[diffuse reflection|diffusively scattering]] ([[Lambertian reflectance|Lambertian]]) disk with the same cross-section. The Bond albedo, named after the American astronomer [[George Phillips Bond]] (1825\u20131865), who originally proposed it, is the fraction of [[power (physics)|power]] in the total [[electromagnetic radiation]] incident on an astronomical body that is scattered back out into space. The Bond albedo is a value strictly between 0 and 1, as it includes all possible scattered light (but not radiation from the body itself).  This is in contrast to other definitions of [[albedo]] such as the geometric albedo, which can be above 1. In general, though, the Bond albedo may be greater or smaller than the geometric albedo, depending on surface and atmospheric properties of the body in question.</ref> Surface features include the large southern [[polar ice cap|polar cap]], older cratered planes cross-cut by [[graben]] and [[Escarpment|scarps]], as well as youthful features probably formed by endogenic processes like [[cryovolcano|cryovolcanism]].<ref name=\"Smith1989\" /> ''Voyager 2'' observations revealed a number of active [[geyser]]s within the polar cap heated by the Sun, which eject plumes to the height of up to 8&nbsp;km.<ref name=\"Smith1989\" /> Triton has a relatively high density of about 2&nbsp;g/cm<sup>3</sup> indicating that [[rock (geology)|rocks]] constitute about two thirds of its mass, and ices (mainly water ice) the remaining one third. There may be a layer of liquid water deep inside Triton, forming a subterranean ocean.<ref name=Hussmann2006/> Because of its retrograde orbit and relative proximity to Neptune (closer than the Moon is to Earth), [[tidal deceleration]] is causing Triton to spiral inward, which will lead to its destruction in about 3.6 billion years.<ref name=\"Chyba\">\n{{cite journal | last = Chyba | first = C.

It has a prograde but very eccentric orbit and is believed to be a former regular satellite that was scattered to its current orbit through gravitational interactions during Triton's capture.<ref name=\"Goldreich1989\" /> Water ice has been spectroscopically detected on its surface. Early measurements of Nereid showed large, irregular variations in its visible magnitude, which were speculated to be caused by forced [[precession]] or chaotic rotation combined with an elongated shape and bright or dark spots on the surface.<ref name=Shaefer2008/> This was disproved in 2016, when observations from the [[Kepler space telescope]] showed only minor variations. Thermal modeling based on infrared observations from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope|Spitzer]] and [[Herschel Space Observatory|Herschel]] space telescopes suggest that Nereid is only moderately elongated which disfavours forced precession of the rotation.<ref name=\":0\" /> The thermal model also indicates that the surface roughness of Nereid is very high, likely similar to the Saturnian moon [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Kiss|first=C.|last2=P\u00e1l|first2=A.|last3=Farkas-Tak\u00e1cs|first3=A.

Given the similarity of their orbits, it was suggested that Neso and Psamathe could have a common origin in the break-up of a larger moon.<ref name=\"SheppardJewittKleyna2006\" /> Psamathe and Neso have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered in the Solar system to date. They take 25 years to orbit Neptune at an average of 125 times the distance between Earth and the Moon. Neptune has the largest [[Hill sphere]] in the Solar System, owing primarily to its large distance from the Sun; this allows it to retain control of such distant moons.<ref name=\"Jewitt2007\" /> Nevertheless, Jupiter's [[S/2003 J 2]] orbits at the greatest percentage of the primary's Hill radius of all the moons in the Solar System on average, and the Jovian moons in the [[Carme group|Carme]] and [[Pasiphae group]]s orbit at a greater percentage of their primary's Hill radius than Psamathe and Neso.<ref name=\"Jewitt2007\" />\n\n==Formation==\nThe mass distribution of the Neptunian moons is the most lopsided of the satellite systems of the [[giant planet]]s in the Solar System. One moon, Triton, makes up nearly all of the mass of the system, with all other moons together comprising only one third of one percent. This is similar to the moon system of Saturn, where [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] makes up more than 95% of the total mass, but is different from the more balanced systems of Jupiter and Uranus. The reason for the lopsidedness of the present Neptunian system is that Triton was captured well after the formation of Neptune's original satellite system, much of which would have been destroyed in the process of capture.<ref name=\"Goldreich1989\" /><ref name=Naeye2006>{{cite journal|journal=[[Sky & Telescope]]|date=September 2006|title=Triton Kidnap Caper|volume=112|first=R.|issue=3|last=Naeye|page=18|bibcode=2006S&T...112c..18N}}</ref>\n[[File:Masa de triton.svg|thumb|The relative masses of the Neptunian moons|left]]\nTriton's orbit upon capture would have been highly eccentric, and would have caused chaotic perturbations in the orbits of the original inner Neptunian satellites, causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble.<ref name=\"Goldreich1989\" /> This means it is likely that Neptune's present inner satellites are not the original bodies that formed with Neptune.

By far the largest of them is [[Triton (moon)|Triton]], discovered by [[William Lassell]] on October 10, 1846, 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself; over a century passed before the discovery of the second natural satellite, [[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]]. Neptune's outermost moon [[Neso (moon)|Neso]], which has an orbital period of about 26 [[Julian year (astronomy)|Julian years]], orbits further from its planet than any other moon in the [[Solar System]].<ref>http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?sat_elem#neptune (as of Dec-2014)</ref>\n\nTriton is unique among moons of [[Planet#Planetary-mass objects|planetary mass]] in that its orbit is [[Retrograde and prograde motion|retrograde]] to Neptune's rotation and [[Orbital inclination|inclined]] relative to Neptune's equator, which suggests that it did not form in orbit around Neptune but was instead gravitationally captured by it. The next-largest irregular satellite in the [[Solar System]], [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]], has only 0.03% of Triton's mass. The capture of Triton, probably occurring some time after Neptune formed a satellite system, was a catastrophic event for Neptune's original satellites, disrupting their orbits so that they collided to form a rubble disc. Triton is massive enough to have achieved [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] and to retain a thin atmosphere capable of forming clouds and hazes.\n\nInward of Triton are seven small [[regular moon|regular satellites]], all of which have [[Retrograde and prograde motion|prograde orbits]] in planes that lie close to Neptune's equatorial plane; some of these orbit among [[Rings of Neptune|Neptune's rings]]. The largest of them is [[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]]. They were re-accreted from the rubble disc generated after Triton's capture after the Tritonian orbit became circular. Neptune also has six more outer [[irregular satellite]]s other than Triton, including Nereid, whose orbits are much farther from Neptune and at high inclination: three of these have prograde orbits, while the remainder have retrograde orbits. In particular, Nereid has an unusually close and eccentric orbit for an irregular satellite, suggesting that it may have once been a regular satellite that was significantly perturbed to its current position when Triton was captured. The two outermost Neptunian irregular satellites, [[Psamathe (moon)|Psamathe]] and [[Neso (moon)|Neso]], have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered in the Solar System to date.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Tritonian sky.jpg|thumb|Simulated view of Neptune in the [[Extraterrestrial skies|hypothetical sky]] of Triton]]\n\n===Discovery===\n[[Triton (moon)|Triton]] was discovered by [[William Lassell]] in 1846, just seventeen days after the [[discovery of Neptune]].<ref name=Lassell1846/> [[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]] was discovered by [[Gerard Kuiper|Gerard P.

Tholen]] on May 24, 1981. The astronomers were observing a star's close approach to Neptune, looking for rings similar to [[Rings of Uranus|those discovered around Uranus]] four years earlier.<ref name=\"Reitsema1982\"/> If rings were present, the star's luminosity would decrease slightly just before the planet's closest approach. The star's luminosity dipped only for several seconds, which meant that it was due to a moon rather than a ring.\n\nNo further moons were found until ''[[Voyager 2]]'' flew by Neptune in 1989. ''Voyager 2'' rediscovered Larissa and discovered five inner moons: [[Naiad (moon)|Naiad]], [[Thalassa (moon)|Thalassa]], [[Despina (moon)|Despina]], [[Galatea (moon)|Galatea]] and [[Proteus (moon)|Proteus]].<ref name=\"Smith1989\"/> In 2001 two surveys using large ground-based telescopes found five additional outer moons, bringing the total to thirteen.<ref name=\"HolmanKavelaarsGrav2004\"/> Follow-up surveys by two teams in 2002 and 2003 respectively re-observed all five of these moons, which are [[Halimede (moon)|Halimede]], [[Sao (moon)|Sao]], [[Psamathe (moon)|Psamathe]], [[Laomedeia]], and [[Neso (moon)|Neso]].<ref name=\"HolmanKavelaarsGrav2004\"/><ref name=\"SheppardJewittKleyna2006\"/> A sixth candidate moon was also found in the 2002 survey and was lost thereafter: it may have been a [[centaur (minor planet)|centaur]] instead of a satellite, although its small amount of motion relative to Neptune over a month suggests that it was indeed a satellite.<ref name=\"HolmanKavelaarsGrav2004\"/> It was estimated to have a diameter of  33&nbsp;km and to have been about 25.1&nbsp;million&nbsp;km (0.168&nbsp;[[astronomical unit|AU]]) from Neptune when it was found.<ref name=\"HolmanKavelaarsGrav2004\" />\n\n[[Mark Showalter]] discovered [[Hippocamp (moon)|Hippocamp]] on 1 July 2013 while examining Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of Neptune's [[Rings of Neptune#Adams ring|ring arcs]] from 2009.

The Bond albedo is a value strictly between 0 and 1, as it includes all possible scattered light (but not radiation from the body itself).

They take 25 years to orbit Neptune at an average of 125 times the distance between Earth and the Moon.

One moon, Triton, makes up nearly all of the mass of the system, with all other moons together comprising only one third of one percent. This is similar to the moon system of Saturn, where [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] makes up more than 95% of the total mass, but is different from the more balanced systems of Jupiter and Uranus. The reason for the lopsidedness of the present Neptunian system is that Triton was captured well after the formation of Neptune's original satellite system, much of which would have been destroyed in the process of capture.<ref name=\"Goldreich1989\" /><ref name=Naeye2006>{{cite journal|journal=[[Sky & Telescope]]|date=September 2006|title=Triton Kidnap Caper|volume=112|first=R.|issue=3|last=Naeye|page=18|bibcode=2006S&T...112c..18N}}</ref>\n[[File:Masa de triton.svg|thumb|The relative masses of the Neptunian moons|left]]\nTriton's orbit upon capture would have been highly eccentric, and would have caused chaotic perturbations in the orbits of the original inner Neptunian satellites, causing them to collide and reduce to a disc of rubble.<ref name=\"Goldreich1989\" /> This means it is likely that Neptune's present inner satellites are not the original bodies that formed with Neptune. Only after Triton's orbit became circularised could some of the rubble re-accrete into the present-day regular moons.<ref name=\"BanfieldMurray\" />\n\nThe mechanism of Triton's capture has been the subject of several theories over the years. One of them postulates that Triton was captured in a [[three-body problem|three-body]] encounter. In this scenario, Triton is the surviving member of a [[Binary asteroid|binary]] [[Kuiper belt]] object{{#tag:ref|[[Minor-planet moon#Trans-Neptunian objects|Binary objects]], objects with moons such as the [[Pluto]]\u2013[[Charon (moon)|Charon]] system, are quite common among the larger [[trans-Neptunian object]]s (TNOs). Around 11% of all TNOs may be binaries.<ref name=\"Agnor2006\" />|group=note}} disrupted by its encounter with Neptune.<ref name=\"Agnor2006\" />\n\nNumerical simulations show that there is a 0.41 probability that the moon Halimede collided with Nereid at some time in the past.<ref name=\"HolmanKavelaarsGrav2004\" /> Although it is not known whether any collision has taken place, both moons appear to have similar (\"grey\") colors, implying that Halimede could be a fragment of Nereid.<ref name=\"GravHolmanFraser2004\">{{cite journal| doi = 10.1086/424997| last1 = Grav| first1 = Tommy| last2 = Holman| first2 = Matthew J.| authorlink2 = Matthew J.

She started the library by using her own books as well as books that belonged to her mother as well as using the services of a local church\u2019s lending library. After moving locations multiple times as it grew in popularity, it eventually was renamed after Congressman \u201cBob\u201d Sikes who served in Congress from 1940-1979.  Today, it is a thriving public library.\n\n*[https://www.cityofdestin.com/library Destin Library]\nThe Destin Library is located in Destin, FL.  While the Okaloosa County Public Library Cooperative was officially formed in 1997, Destin wasn\u2019t added until about the year 2000.

It was established in 1927 by the Women\u2019s Club in an old Masonic building near the waterfront of the city.  In order to keep the library open, they would rotate services during the days of the week, each service offered on a particular day of the week.  The library ended up closing to the public after donating all of its inventory to the local high school to help them meet their requirements to the students.  In 1954, the Business and Professional Women\u2019s Club assisted the Women\u2019s Club to re-establish the public library, and it is thriving today.\n\n*[http://www.cityofmaryesther.com/186/Library Mary Esther Public Library]\nThe Mary Esther Public Library was first proposed in 1974 and was approved, taking up only a space of 585 square feet.  After a new building was provided in 1988, the library\u2019s popularity and utilization continued to grow.  In 1990, a grant was approved to construct a brand new library and it was opened to the public in 1992.  In 2004, the library was expanded and it thrives today serving the citizens of Mary Esther, FL and Okaloosa County.\n\n*[https://cityofniceville.org/169/Library Niceville Library]\nThe Niceville Library became a part of the library cooperative in 1997 in Okaloosa County.

It was selected for the UK's [[Joint Combat Aircraft]] requirement in 2001 and is expected to enter service with the [[Royal Navy]] and the RAF from around 2020, having been selected initially to replace the Royal Navy's [[Sea Harrier]] fighter, and latterly the existing Tornado GR.4 and Harrier GR.9  fleets (the latter already having been retired in late 2010), operating principally from the [[Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carrier]]s.<ref name=\"avweek-sdsr\">Wall, Robert.[http://www.aviationweek.com/aw/generic/story_channel.jsp?channel=defense&id=news/awx/2010/10/19/awx_10_19_2010_p0-263355.xml&headline=U.K.%20Cuts%20Aircraft%20Fleets%20in%20Strategic%20Review \"U.K. Cuts Aircraft Fleets in Strategic Review\"].

However, on 19 October 2010, [[David Cameron]] announced that the UK would change their order to the F-35C [[CATOBAR]] [[aircraft carrier|carrier]] variant for both the RAF and Navy.
