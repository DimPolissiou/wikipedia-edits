The academic program runs from Montessori Toddler and Pre-Kindergarten to Grade 12.  The current Head of College is Marc Ayotte.\n\nHillfield Strathallan College is divided into four schools: Montessori, Junior, Middle, and Senior School.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Highfield School (playing hockey) Hamilton.jpg|thumb|Postcard of Highfield School, circa 1910]]\nFounded in 1901 as '''Highfield School for Boys''', this school was the first private residential and day school for boys in the city of Hamilton.   It was a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] for boys planning to enter the [[Royal Military College of Canada]].  Many graduates played key roles in the Canadian military.  A series of name changes, reconstructions, new construction, and amalgamations with other institutions have since occurred, resulting in a single modern co-educational facility.  Strathallan College was a school for girls nearby.  Eventually, the two schools merged and began a co-education program.  Alumni from all founding organizations attended the centennial celebration in 2001.\n\n===Timeline===\n\n*1901 \u2013 Highfield School for Boys founded with premises on Aberdeen Avenue between Bay Street South and Ravenscliffe Avenue\n*1920 \u2013 Hillcrest School was founded on the northwest corner of Main and Queen Streets, as a replacement for the previous school that burned down two years prior.\n*1923 \u2013 Strathallan School founded with premises on 15 Robinson Street in Hamilton.\n*1929 \u2013 '''Hill'''crest School and High'''field''' School were merged into '''Hillfield School''', with new premises on Main Street West in Hamilton.\n*A memorial plaque was unveiled as a list of honour ''In proud memory of Boys of Highfield School who gave their lives in the Great War'' <ref>http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=8252{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} War Memorial plaque</ref>\n*mid-50s \u2013 25 Robinson Street was purchased to augment the facilities.\n*1959 \u2013 The Hillfield School program was extended through Grade 13 and the school was renamed Hillfield College.\n*1961 \u2013 Strathallan School was renamed Strathallan College.\n*1962 \u2013 The two colleges, now named Hillfield-Strathallan Colleges, were put under a single Board of Governors, which ran the colleges in co-ordinated but separate manner during a transition period.

The academic program runs from Montessori Toddler and Pre-Kindergarten to Grade 12.  The current Head of College is Marc Ayotte.\n\nHillfield Strathallan College is divided into four schools: Montessori, Junior, Middle, and Senior School.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Highfield School (playing hockey) Hamilton.jpg|thumb|Postcard of Highfield School, circa 1910]]\nFounded in 1901 as '''Highfield School for Boys''', this school was the first private residential and day school for boys in the city of Hamilton.   It was a [[University-preparatory school|prep school]] for boys planning to enter the [[Royal Military College of Canada]].  Many graduates played key roles in the Canadian military.  A series of name changes, reconstructions, new construction, and amalgamations with other institutions have since occurred, resulting in a single modern co-educational facility.  Strathallan College was a school for girls nearby.  Eventually, the two schools merged and began a co-education program.  Alumni from all founding organizations attended the centennial celebration in 2001.\n\n===Timeline===\n\n*1901 \u2013 Highfield School for Boys founded with premises on Aberdeen Avenue between Bay Street South and Ravenscliffe Avenue\n*1920 \u2013 Hillcrest School was founded on the northwest corner of Main and Queen Streets, as a replacement for the previous school that burned down two years prior.\n*1923 \u2013 Strathallan School founded with premises on 15 Robinson Street in Hamilton.\n*1929 \u2013 '''Hill'''crest School and High'''field''' School were merged into '''Hillfield School''', with new premises on Main Street West in Hamilton.\n*A memorial plaque was unveiled as a list of honour ''In proud memory of Boys of Highfield School who gave their lives in the Great War'' <ref>http://www.cmp-cpm.forces.gc.ca/dhh-dhp/nic-inm/sm-rm/mdsr-rdr-eng.asp?PID=8252{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} War Memorial plaque</ref>\n*mid-50s \u2013 25 Robinson Street was purchased to augment the facilities.\n*1959 \u2013 The Hillfield School program was extended through Grade 13 and the school was renamed Hillfield College.\n*1961 \u2013 Strathallan School was renamed Strathallan College.\n*1962 \u2013 The two colleges, now named Hillfield-Strathallan Colleges, were put under a single Board of Governors, which ran the colleges in co-ordinated but separate manner during a transition period.
