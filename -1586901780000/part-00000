{"title_page": "Logos and uniforms of the New York Jets", "text_new": "[[Image:New York Jets logo.svg|thumb|300px|New York Jets primary logo, 2019\u2013present.]]\n\nThe [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s [[New York Jets]] began play in 1960 as the Titans of New York, a charter member of the [[American Football League]] (AFL). When the Titans became the Jets in 1963 the team colors changed from navy blue and gold to green and white, which they have remained ever since, although the franchise has used different shades of green and has at times used black as a third/trim color. For most of their history, the Jets had white helmets with green striping and logos, green and white jerseys with opposite-colored sleeves and shoulder stripes, and white pants with two green stripes down each side. The team switched to green helmets and a simpler design in 1978, replacing the football-shaped logo with a modernized wordmark, then in 1990 added black trim and green pants. In 1998 the team reverted to its \"classic\" look, with an updated version of the prior logo, and replaced the traditional kelly green with a darker hunter green. \n\nThe Jets' current uniforms have been in use since 2019; the colors are now a medium green that the franchise calls \"Gotham Green,\" white, and black. The primary logo is a green football-shaped oval outlined in white, oriented horizontally, with the word \"JETS\" in thick, sans-serif italics positioned just below the horizontal axis with \"NEW YORK\" above it in smaller letters, and a miniature football graphic at bottom center partially covering the lower portion of the \"E\" and \"T\". \n\nThe primary uniform consists of green jerseys with white numerals and white jerseys with green numerals, green and white pants, and green socks. The numerals are in a new sans-serif block-style font and have thin black outlines, with \"NEW YORK\" in thick sans-serif italics above the numerals on the front, TV numerals on the upper shoulders, and the player's name in sans-serif block letters on the back, in either green or white. The jerseys have opposite-colored horizontal stripes around the shoulders that taper toward the collar, and the pants have an opposite-colored stripe on each side that tapers toward the lower thigh.\n\nThe helmet is a deep metallic emerald green shell with a black facemask; the decal on each side is a secondary logo, consisting of the primary logo's \"JETS\" wordmark and football graphic in white. \n\nThe team also has a black alternate uniform with white numerals outlined in green, green stripes, and black socks.\n\n==History of the Jets' logos and uniforms==\n===1960\u20131962: Titans of New York===\n[[File:DarrelleRevis.JPG|thumb|left|Cornerback [[Darrelle Revis]] wearing the New York Titans throwback uniform in 2008.

The pants were white with two parallel green stripes on each side, and the socks were green above the ankle with two parallel white stripes around the calf. The new helmets were white with a single green stripe down the center; the logo decal on each side was a silhouette of a jet airplane in green, with the nose pointed toward the front of the helmet and the word \"JETS\" in thick white sans-serif italics along the fuselage. In 1964, the single green stripe became two parallel stripes, and the jet-plane decals were replaced with a white football shape outlined in green, with the word \"JETS\" in green sans-serif italics in front of \"NY\" in green outline serif lettering, and a miniature football at bottom center. The decals were difficult to see from a distance (or on television), so the colors were reversed and the decals enlarged in 1965.\n\nThis design remained largely unchanged through 1977, apart from some variations to the numeral and lettering typefaces, the angle of the helmet decals, and adjustments to the shoulder and sleeve striping due to changes in NFL jersey tailoring and materials.<ref name=\"C185\"/> The white stripes on the socks were eliminated in 1975. Also, for at least one game in 1971 the Jets used a variation of their white jerseys that had no green stripes on the shoulders above the green sleeves.\n\n===1978\u20131997: Green helmets and modern logo===\n[[Image:New York Jets Logo 1978-1997.png|thumb|left|300px|1978\u201397 Jets wordmark and primary logo.

Note the green helmet, wordmark decal and modified shoulder/sleeve design.]]\nThe Jets' first major design change was made for the 1978 season. The kelly green and white color scheme was retained; the new helmets were solid green with white facemasks, and a stylized \"JETS\" wordmark in white on each side. The mark featured angular lettering and a silhouette of a modern jet airplane extending horizontally to the right from the top of the \"J\" above the \"ETS\". The jerseys featured large TV numerals on the shoulders and two thick parallel stripes on the sleeves, while the pants had a single green stripe from hip to knee on each side.<ref name=\"C185\"/> The team used both serif and sans-serif lettering for player names on the back of the jerseys in 1978 and 1979, then sans-serif only beginning in 1980. From 1985-89, the Jets wore their white jerseys at home as well as on the road; the green jerseys appeared only on rare occasions in road games when the host team wore white.\n  \nIn 1990, the Jets modified this design by adding thin black outlines to the numerals, lettering, stripes and helmet decals, and changing the facemasks from white to black.<ref name=\"C185\"/> The team reverted to using the green jersey as its primary home uniform, reintroduced the white stripes on the socks, and added a set of green pants to be worn with the white jerseys along with white socks that had two parallel green stripes around the calf. In 1995, player names on the backs of the jerseys were changed from black-outlined sans-serif lettering to one-color serif lettering. The team occasionally wore white pants and standard socks with the white jerseys in 1995 and 1996, then did so for all games in 1997. \n\n===1998\u20132018: Retro update===\n[[Image:Jets 2011.jpg|thumb|300px|This photo from 2011 shows the 1998\u20132018 Jets uniform, which was generally consistent during that time with some variations in tailoring and coloration.

Their team colors are \"Gotham Green, Spotlight White and Stealth Black.\"}}</ref> The new design replaced the dark hunter green with a medium green that the team calls \"Gotham Green,\" and again added black to the traditional green-and-white color scheme. The primary logo was modified to be more football-shaped, with the \"JETS\" wordmark adjusted to make the \"J\" the same height as the other letters and moved slightly downward, the redesigned football graphic partially covering the lower portion of the letters \"E\" and \"T\". The serif outline \"NY\" behind the \"JETS\" wordmark was eliminated, and replaced with \"NEW YORK\" centered above it in smaller sans-serif italics.\n\nThe helmet was changed to a deep metallic emerald green shell with a black facemask, no striping, and a secondary logo on each side consisting of the \"JETS\" wordmark and football graphic from the primary logo. The green and white primary jerseys have numerals with thin black outlines in a new sans-serif block-style font, with single horizontal stripes around the shoulders tapering toward the collar, a \"NEW YORK\" wordmark above the numerals on the front, and the player's name in sans-serif block letters on the back. The TV numerals were shifted from the sleeves to the upper shoulders. The jerseys are paired with either green or white pants, with a tapered stripe on each side from hip to lower thigh, and green or white socks.\n\nThe Jets also introduced a black alternate uniform, with white numerals outlined in green, green striping, and black socks.\n\n==Throwbacks and special uniforms==\nIn [[1993 New York Jets season|1993]] the Jets became the first NFL team to wear a [[Throwback uniform|\"throwback\"]] uniform, for a home game against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] celebrating the 25th anniversary of the [[1968 New York Jets season|1968 championship team]].

When the Titans became the Jets in 1963 the team colors changed from navy blue and gold to green and white, which they have remained ever since, although the franchise has used different shades of green and has at times used black as a third/trim color. For most of their history, the Jets had white helmets with green striping and logos, green and white jerseys with opposite-colored sleeves and shoulder stripes, and white pants with two green stripes down each side. The team switched to green helmets and a simpler design in 1978, replacing the football-shaped logo with a modernized wordmark, then in 1990 added black trim and green pants. In 1998 the team reverted to its \"classic\" look, with an updated version of the prior logo, and replaced the traditional kelly green with a darker hunter green. \n\nThe Jets' current uniforms have been in use since 2019; the colors are now a medium green that the franchise calls \"Gotham Green,\" white, and black. The primary logo is a green football-shaped oval outlined in white, oriented horizontally, with the word \"JETS\" in thick, sans-serif italics positioned just below the horizontal axis with \"NEW YORK\" above it in smaller letters, and a miniature football graphic at bottom center partially covering the lower portion of the \"E\" and \"T\". \n\nThe primary uniform consists of green jerseys with white numerals and white jerseys with green numerals, green and white pants, and green socks. The numerals are in a new sans-serif block-style font and have thin black outlines, with \"NEW YORK\" in thick sans-serif italics above the numerals on the front, TV numerals on the upper shoulders, and the player's name in sans-serif block letters on the back, in either green or white. The jerseys have opposite-colored horizontal stripes around the shoulders that taper toward the collar, and the pants have an opposite-colored stripe on each side that tapers toward the lower thigh.\n\nThe helmet is a deep metallic emerald green shell with a black facemask; the decal on each side is a secondary logo, consisting of the primary logo's \"JETS\" wordmark and football graphic in white. \n\nThe team also has a black alternate uniform with white numerals outlined in green, green stripes, and black socks.\n\n==History of the Jets' logos and uniforms==\n===1960\u20131962: Titans of New York===\n[[File:DarrelleRevis.JPG|thumb|left|Cornerback [[Darrelle Revis]] wearing the New York Titans throwback uniform in 2008.

The pants were white with two parallel green stripes on each side, and the socks were green above the ankle with two parallel white stripes around the calf. The new helmets were white with a single green stripe down the center; the logo decal on each side was a silhouette of a jet airplane in green, with the nose pointed toward the front of the helmet and the word \"JETS\" in thick white sans-serif italics along the fuselage. In 1964, the single green stripe became two parallel stripes, and the jet-plane decals were replaced with a white football shape outlined in green, with the word \"JETS\" in green sans-serif italics in front of \"NY\" in green outline serif lettering, and a miniature football at bottom center. The decals were difficult to see from a distance (or on television), so the colors were reversed and the decals enlarged in 1965.\n\nThis design remained largely unchanged through 1977, apart from some variations to the numeral and lettering typefaces, the angle of the helmet decals, and adjustments to the shoulder and sleeve striping due to changes in NFL jersey tailoring and materials.<ref name=\"C185\"/> The white stripes on the socks were eliminated in 1975.

Note the green helmet, wordmark decal and modified shoulder/sleeve design.]]\nThe Jets' first major design change was made for the 1978 season. The kelly green and white color scheme was retained; the new helmets were solid green with white facemasks, and a stylized \"JETS\" wordmark in white on each side. The mark featured angular lettering and a silhouette of a modern jet airplane extending horizontally to the right from the top of the \"J\" above the \"ETS\". The jerseys featured large TV numerals on the shoulders and two thick parallel stripes on the sleeves, while the pants had a single green stripe from hip to knee on each side.<ref name=\"C185\"/> The team used both serif and sans-serif lettering for player names on the back of the jerseys in 1978 and 1979, then sans-serif only beginning in 1980. From 1985-89, the Jets wore their white jerseys at home as well as on the road; the green jerseys appeared only on rare occasions in road games when the host team wore white.\n  \nIn 1990, the Jets modified this design by adding thin black outlines to the numerals, lettering, stripes and helmet decals, and changing the facemasks from white to black.<ref name=\"C185\"/> The team reverted to using the green jersey as its primary home uniform, reintroduced the white stripes on the socks, and added a set of green pants to be worn with the white jerseys along with white socks that had two parallel green stripes around the calf. In 1995, player names on the backs of the jerseys were changed from black-outlined sans-serif lettering to one-color serif lettering. The team occasionally wore white pants and standard socks with the white jerseys in 1995 and 1996, then did so for all games in 1997. \n\n===1998\u20132018: Retro update===\n[[Image:Jets 2011.jpg|thumb|300px|This photo from 2011 shows the 1998\u20132018 Jets uniform, which was generally consistent during that time with some variations in tailoring and coloration.

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting, the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;... I did most of it.\" When a [[sniper]] fired at one of his officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=568}} When the commander of US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] was killed in action {{convert|150|mi|km|disp=flip}} inside Germany on 30&nbsp;March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45&nbsp;Germans were executed after surrendering.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|pp=581\u2013582}} An artillery officer wrote home in April \"we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=598}} At least one British battalion refused to take [[Waffen-SS]] prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS \"truculence\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=499}} A British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: \"At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British pilot wrote: \"It seemed a stupid time to die.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British [[corporal]] spoke for many when he wrote \"Why don't the silly bastards give up?\"{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}} The historian [[Max Hastings]] wrote \"The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=491}}\n\n===Battle for S\u00f6gel===\n[[File:Moncel and Vokes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=Major-General Christopher Vokes in discussion with Brigadier Robert Moncel standing in a street in S\u00f6gel on 10&nbsp;April 1945|{{center|Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]] (right) with Brigadier [[Robert Moncel]] at S\u00f6gel on 10 April 1945.}}]]\nIn early April 1945 the 4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of [[II&nbsp;Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of the Allied crossing of the [[Rhine]] in [[Operation Plunder]]. On 4&nbsp;April, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], part of the [[10th&nbsp;Canadian Infantry Brigade]], one of two [[brigades]] in the division,{{#tag:ref|The other battalions in the brigade were: [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]]; and [[The Algonquin Regiment]].{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}\n\nThe division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to S\u00f6gel, which the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of [[Lake Superior Regiment|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]]{{#tag:ref|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) was the infantry part of [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]] which also included: 21st Armoured Regiment ([[The Governor General's Foot Guards]]); 22nd&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]]); and 28th&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The British Columbia Regiment]]).{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} captured on 9&nbsp;April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \"The Sod of S\u00f6gel\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives. Accordingly, as a [[reprisal]] and a warning, several houses in the centre of S\u00f6gel were ordered destroyed by the engineers to provide rubble.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}}}}\n\n==Battle for Friesoythe==\n\nThe Canadian advance continued across the [[Westphalian Lowland]], reaching the outskirts of Friesoythe, a strategic crossroads, on 13&nbsp;April. As it was early spring, the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} This made Friesoythe, {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} west of [[Oldenburg]], on the River [[Soeste]], a potential bottleneck. If the Germans were to hold it, the bulk of the Canadians would be unable to continue their advance.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}} Most of the population of 4,000 had evacuated to the countryside on 11\u201312 April.{{#tag:ref|The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on 11&nbsp; April. If the District Court ceased to function on 11&nbsp;April 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between 11&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;April. This was clearly a German initiative.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|pp=165, 189}}{{sfn|Brockhaus|1996|p=730}}|group=Note}} Several hundred paratroopers from Battalion Raabe of the German [[7th Parachute Division (Germany)|7th&nbsp;Parachute Division]] and anti-tank guns defended the town.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}}{{sfn|Sirluck|1945|}} The paratroopers repelled an attack by the Lake Superior Regiment, which suffered several killed and wounded; German casualties are unknown.{{sfn|Marsh|2015|}}\n\nVokes ordered the resumption of the attack by the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), commanded by [[Lieutenant-colonel (Canada)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Frederick Wigle. The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30. A firefight broke out, resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers. A rumour circulated that a local civilian had shot Wigle.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}}{{sfn|A&SHC archive|1945}}{{sfn|Fraser|1996|p=431}}\n\n===Destruction of Friesoythe===\nVokes was furious when he heard of Wigle's death. He wrote in his autobiography that \"a first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back\". Vokes wrote, \"I summoned my {{Abbr|GSO1|general staff officer}}... 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town. Tell 'em we're going to level the fucking place. Get the people the hell out of their houses first.{{'\"}}{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Vokes|1985|pages=194\u2013195}} Vokes's [[Staff_(military)#British_and_Commonwealth_staff|GSO1 (head of the operations staff)]], Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie Robinson, obeyed but convinced him to not put this order in writing or issue a proclamation to the local civilians.{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=259, 295}} Hastings writes that the earlier incident at S\u00f6gel contributed to Vokes's fury.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}}\n\nThe Argylls had spontaneously begun to burn Friesoythe in reprisal for the death of their commander.{{sfn|Fraser|1996|pp=435\u2013437}} After Vokes had issued his order, the town was systematically set on fire with [[flamethrowers]] mounted on [[Universal Carrier|Wasp Carriers]]. In the side streets, soldiers threw petrol containers into buildings and ignited them with [[White phosphorus munitions|phosphorus grenades]]. The attack continued for over eight hours and Friesoythe was almost totally destroyed.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} As the commanding officer of the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, [[The Algonquin Regiment]] later wrote, \"the raging Highlanders cleared the remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries, we venture to say\".{{sfn|Cassidy|1948|p=307}} The war diary of the 4th&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Brigade records, \"when darkness fell Friesoythe was a reasonable facsimile of Dante's Inferno\".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}\n\nThe Canadian official history states that Friesoythe \"was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal\".{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=722}} The rubble was used to reinforce the local roads for the division's tanks and heavy transport, which had been unable to move up due to the main roads near the town being badly cratered, and the smaller roads being inadequate to stand their weight.{{sfn|Rogers|1989|p=259}}{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p=16}}\n\n===Civilian casualties and damage===\nDuring the fighting around Friesoythe and its aftermath, ten civilians from the town and another ten from the surrounding villages were killed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} There were reports of civilians lying dead in the streets.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} According to one German assessment, 85\u201390 per cent of the town was destroyed during the reprisal.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|p=189}} The {{Lang|de|[[Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die]]}} estimates the destruction to have been as high as 90 per cent.

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting, the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;... I did most of it.\" When a [[sniper]] fired at one of his officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=568}} When the commander of US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] was killed in action {{convert|150|mi|km|disp=flip}} inside Germany on 30&nbsp;March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45&nbsp;Germans were executed after surrendering.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|pp=581\u2013582}} An artillery officer wrote home in April \"we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=598}} At least one British battalion refused to take [[Waffen-SS]] prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS \"truculence\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=499}} A British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: \"At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British pilot wrote: \"It seemed a stupid time to die.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British [[corporal]] spoke for many when he wrote \"Why don't the silly bastards give up?\"{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}} The historian [[Max Hastings]] wrote \"The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=491}}\n\n===Battle for S\u00f6gel===\n[[File:Moncel and Vokes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=Major-General Christopher Vokes in discussion with Brigadier Robert Moncel standing in a street in S\u00f6gel on 10&nbsp;April 1945|{{center|Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]] (right) with Brigadier [[Robert Moncel]] at S\u00f6gel on 10 April 1945.}}]]\nIn early April 1945 the 4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of [[II&nbsp;Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of the Allied crossing of the [[Rhine]] in [[Operation Plunder]]. On 4&nbsp;April, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], part of the [[10th&nbsp;Canadian Infantry Brigade]], one of two [[brigades]] in the division,{{#tag:ref|The other battalions in the brigade were: [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]]; and [[The Algonquin Regiment]].{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}\n\nThe division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to S\u00f6gel, which the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of [[Lake Superior Regiment|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]]{{#tag:ref|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) was the infantry part of [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]] which also included: 21st Armoured Regiment ([[The Governor General's Foot Guards]]); 22nd&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]]); and 28th&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The British Columbia Regiment]]).{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} captured on 9&nbsp;April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \"The Sod of S\u00f6gel\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives. Accordingly, as a [[reprisal]] and a warning, several houses in the centre of S\u00f6gel were ordered destroyed by the engineers to provide rubble.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}}}}\n\n==Battle for Friesoythe==\n\nThe Canadian advance continued across the [[Westphalian Lowland]], reaching the outskirts of Friesoythe, a strategic crossroads, on 13&nbsp;April. As it was early spring, the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} This made Friesoythe, {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} west of [[Oldenburg]], on the River [[Soeste]], a potential bottleneck.

Jikki sang many songs under her husband's direction that are still played by radio stations. A. M. Raja and Jikki have sung for live programmes in other countries such as U. S.

Once when she sang five songs for a Tamil film, she asked the producer Valampuri Somanathan to reduce her remuneration because he had given her the opportunity to sing so many songs in a single movie, such was her dedication for singing.<ref name=hindu />\n\n==Death==\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nShe had been suffering from breast cancer and had surgery, but the cancer spread to her kidneys and eventually liver. Several attempts were made to save her life by her close friend and singer [[Jamuna Rani]] which were supported by donations through musical nights and medical and financial support from the governments of [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Andhra Pradesh]].\n\nThe then Tamil Nadu chief minister [[J.Jayalalitha]] and the Andhra Pradesh chief minister [[N. Chandrababu Naidu]] had granted Jikki 100,000 rupees from the Dr. MGR trust and 200,000 rupees respectively after hearing of her illness and her difficulty in meeting the treatment expenses.\n\nShe died on 16 August 2004 in [[Chennai]].<ref name=hindu />\n\n==Awards and honours==\nShe was honoured with \"[[Ugadi Puraskaram]]\" by [[Madras Telugu Academy]] and Government of Tamil Nadu awarded her

V. Venkatraman]]. The song was the super hit \"Arul Thaarum Deva Maathaavey Aadhiyey Inba Jothi\" for Kumari Rajamani who acted as the young girl growing into the young woman, [[M. V. Rajamma]] the heroine taking over the song with P. A. Periyanayaki singing as the scene advanced in time.

M. Rajah]], in 1950 when he was introduced in the Tamil film ''[[Samsaram (1950 film)|Samsaram]]'' as a new playback singer by Gemini's [[S. S. Vasan]].

She also sang Sinhalese songs as well at that stage since the Sinhalese films were produced in Madras during those years.<ref name=hindu />\n\nTogether with [[P. Leela]], she reigned supreme in the South Indian film world in the early part of the 1950s, till [[P.Susheela]] took over the center stage from late 1950s.

In order to attract industry and residents to Atlantis the government introduced various incentives to attract manufacturing firms via a system of relocation tax credit. In its heyday in the early to mid-1980s there were approximately 50 industrialists in Atlantis employing people drawn from nearly 8 000 households. These industries included large manufacturing concerns such as [[Tedelex]] and [[Atlantis Diesel Engines]].\n\nManufacturing activities in Atlantis declined with the termination of the incentive programmes and the defence manufacturing contracts from the mid-1980s. The withdrawal of incentives significantly reduced the attractiveness of the area and while Atlantis has since been through a series of mini economic booms and busts the trend declined in the economy of the area.\n \nCurrently, only about 3% of the original companies still have business in Atlantis but numerous new factories and businesses have started to operate in Atlantis. Over the past three years over R1bn has been invested into Atlantis by large multinationals. [[Hisense]] opened a factory in the town in June 2013[2] injecting ZAR 350 million into the first phase of the Atlantis plant, creating 300 production positions and accompanied by a skills-transfer programme led by technicians and engineers from China.<ref name=\"Hisense opens new headquarters in Cape Town, strengthens SA ties\">{{Citation|last=Walker|first=Andy|title=Hisense opens new headquarters in Cape Town, strengthens SA ties|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/technology/2015/06/04/hisense-opens-new-headquarters-in-cape-town-strengthens-sa-ties|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOver R600m has been invested by the green manufacturing industry, for the manufacture of wind towers, wind tower internals and solar panels and the like. The investment is the result of cooperation between the City of Cape Town, the [[Western Cape Provincial Government]], the [[South African Department of Trade and Industry]] and [[GreenCape]].{{cn|date=April 2017}} In 2013, the City of Cape Town in cooperation with the Western Cape Provincial Government declared Atlantis as a priority area for economic development, establishing a Greentech hub for manufacturing of components for the renewable energy and other green industries. An application has also been submitted for the Atlantis Industrial Area to be declared a [[Special Economic Zone]] with the focus on green technology.

In order to attract industry and residents to Atlantis the government introduced various incentives to attract manufacturing firms via a system of relocation tax credit. In its heyday in the early to mid-1980s there were approximately 50 industrialists in Atlantis employing people drawn from nearly 8 000 households. These industries included large manufacturing concerns such as [[Tedelex]] and [[Atlantis Diesel Engines]].\n\nManufacturing activities in Atlantis declined with the termination of the incentive programmes and the defence manufacturing contracts from the mid-1980s. The withdrawal of incentives significantly reduced the attractiveness of the area and while Atlantis has since been through a series of mini economic booms and busts the trend declined in the economy of the area.\n \nCurrently, only about 3% of the original companies still have business in Atlantis but numerous new factories and businesses have started to operate in Atlantis. Over the past three years over R1bn has been invested into Atlantis by large multinationals. [[Hisense]] opened a factory in the town in June 2013[2] injecting ZAR 350 million into the first phase of the Atlantis plant, creating 300 production positions and accompanied by a skills-transfer programme led by technicians and engineers from China.<ref name=\"Hisense opens new headquarters in Cape Town, strengthens SA ties\">{{Citation|last=Walker|first=Andy|title=Hisense opens new headquarters in Cape Town, strengthens SA ties|url=http://www.bdlive.co.za/business/technology/2015/06/04/hisense-opens-new-headquarters-in-cape-town-strengthens-sa-ties|accessdate=14 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nOver R600m has been invested by the green manufacturing industry, for the manufacture of wind towers, wind tower internals and solar panels and the like. The investment is the result of cooperation between the City of Cape Town, the [[Western Cape Provincial Government]], the [[South African Department of Trade and Industry]] and [[GreenCape]].{{cn|date=April 2017}} In 2013, the City of Cape Town in cooperation with the Western Cape Provincial Government declared Atlantis as a priority area for economic development, establishing a Greentech hub for manufacturing of components for the renewable energy and other green industries. An application has also been submitted for the Atlantis Industrial Area to be declared a [[Special Economic Zone]] with the focus on green technology. The SEZ status will provide investors a range of incentives, including the benefits of co-loation, and access to established markets.\n\n'''There have been a range of other interventions to revitalize the local economy:'''\n\n* Upgrading of infrastructure such as the electricity supply, improved public transport system (MyCiti Bus System), installation of a fiber optic network to improve the broad band utilization and load shedding curtailment agreements.\n* A special package of investment incentives for Atlantis, which comprises fast-tracking of building plan approval and land use applications, the waiver of building plan scrutiny fees, reduced electricity tariffs for large electricity users, partial waiver of development contributions, as well as the establishment of an Investment Facilitation Office in Atlantis.
