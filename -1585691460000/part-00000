{"title_page": "Thistle Chapel", "text_new": "[[File:Thistle Chapel West.jpg|thumb|250px|The interior of the Thistle Chapel, looking west]]\nThe '''Thistle Chapel''', located in [[St Giles%27 Cathedral]], [[Edinburgh]], is the chapel of the [[Order of the Thistle]].\n\nAt the foundation of the [[Order of the Thistle]] in 1687, [[James II of England|James VII]] ordered [[Holyrood Abbey]] be fitted out as a chapel for the Knights. At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within [[St Giles%27 Cathedral]]. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork.  [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Holyrood Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|300px|The interior of Holyrood Abbey as the chapel of the Order of the Thistle]]\n===Holyrood Abbey===\n\nOn 29 May 1687, [[James II of England|James VII]] founded the [[Order of the Thistle]] and issued a warrant to designate [[Holyrood Abbey]] the chapel of the new order. This change of purpose necessitated the eventual removal of the Abbey's [[Church of Scotland]] congregation to the [[Canongate Kirk]].<ref name=Burnett9>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 9.</ref>\n\nIn the seventeen months after the publication of the warrant, [[William Bruce (architect)|William Bruce]] oversaw the transformation of the Abbey: an altar and black and white marble floor were added and classical stalls were shipped from London. The Order of the Thistle never met in its new chapel: on 10 December 1688, in the wake of [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]], a mob from Edinburgh destroyed the furnishings.<ref name=Burnett9/><ref name=BurnettHodgson6>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2000, p. 6.</ref>\n\n===Proposals for a new chapel===\n\nAlthough the order was revived in 1703 by [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], no chapel was designated. In 1728, the antiquarian William Douglas suggested the ruins of St Rule's Church in the grounds of [[St Andrews Cathedral]] be restored as a chapel for the order.<ref name=Burnett9/>\nProposals to locate the chapel of the Order in St Giles' go back to 1872, when Secretary of the Order corresponded with the committee for the then-ongoing restoration of the church. In 1879 and 1882, Lindsay Mackersy, session clerk of the High Kirk, and the [[Session (Presbyterianism)|kirk session]]  proposed the south transept of St Giles' as a chapel for the Order. None of these proposals proved practical.<ref name=BurnettHodgson6/><ref>Marshall 2009, pp. 128-129.</ref><ref name=Burnett910>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 9-10.</ref>\n\nIn 1836, [[James Gillespie Graham]] and [[Augustus Pugin]] had drawn up plans to restore Holyrood Abbey as the chapel of the Order. Although Graham and Pugin's plans were not acted upon at the time, the same ambition was advanced in 1905, when [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] set up a fund of \u00a340,000 to restore Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle.<ref name=Burnett910/> On investigation by [[MacGibbon and Ross|Thomas Ross]], the restoration of Holyrood Abbey was found to be impossible.<ref name=BurnettHodgson6/><ref name=Burnett10>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 10.</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nUpon the Earl's death in 1906, the fund reverted to his sons, who offered \u00a322,000 and an endowment of \u00a32,000 to construct a new chapel.<ref name=Burnett10/><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 19.</ref> [[Edward VII]] appointed [[William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch]]; [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]]; [[John David Melville, 12th Earl of Leven]]; and [[Schomberg Kerr McDonnell]] as trustees with [[MacGibbon and Ross|Thomas Ross]] as architectural consultant. The King instructed to the Trustees to write to the kirk session of St. Giles' with the suggestion that a new chapel for the Order be housed in the Cathedral; on 12 March 1909, the Cathedral authorities gratefully accepted this offer. The Trustees appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The King approved Lorimer's plans and the first building contract was signed on 24 August 1909 with the foundation stone being laid on 6 November that year.<ref name=Burnett10/><ref>Matthew 1988, pp. 19-21.</ref><ref>Marshall 2009, p. 147.</ref>\n\nThe Chapel was completed by the autumn of 1910 in time for the first St Andrew's Day gathering of the Knights. The Chapel was formally opened amidst much ceremony on 19 July 1911 by [[George V]].<ref >Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 10-11.</ref> At the opening, police hid in the boiler room beneath the Chapel to guard against the threat of vandalism by [[suffragette]]s. At the end of the ceremony, the king received the Chapel's craftspeople and Lorimer was shortly afterwards knighted for his work.<ref name=Burnett11>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 11.</ref><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 21.</ref>\n\nThe Trustees insisted that \"the Thistle Chapel is a national thing\" and that, as such, preference should be shown to Scottish artisans.<ref name=Cumming39>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 39.</ref> In line with the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]'s emphasis on craftsmanship and collaboration, Lorimer had already assembled a largely Edinburgh-based team of artisans. Of the major contributors to the Chapel, only [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who designed the heraldic stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied decorative metalwork \u2013 were based outside Scotland.<ref name=Boreham16>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 16.</ref><ref>Carruthers 2013, pp. 277-278.</ref> The speed with which the Chapel was completed is, in large part, due to the skill of this team of craftspeople.<ref name=Burnett11/>\n\n===Subsequent history===\nThe former boiler room in the [[undercroft]] of the Chapel was redeveloped in 1982 by [[Bernard Feilden]] and Simpson & Brown.<ref name=Boreham23>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 23.</ref> Between 1987 and 2019, a cafe occupied the space immediately below the Chapel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/lifestyle/last-supper-edinburghs-st-giles-kirk-cafe-closes-after-30-years-638803|title='Last supper at Edinburgh's St Giles as kirk cafe closes after 30 years'|website=edinburghnews.scotsman.com|access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref> \n\nOver four months in 2006, a major cleaning and preservation operation was undertaken by the firm of Charles Taylor: this was the first thorough maintenance project in the Chapel's history.<ref>Marshall 2009, p. 190.</ref>\n\nThe Thistle Chapel was temporarily closed to visitors from February 2015 after a number of valuable items were stolen. The Chapel re-opened to visitors the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-edinburgh-east-fife-35422624|title='Theft-hit Thistle Chapel set to reopen in St Giles' Cathedral'|website=bbc.co.uk|access-date=23 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\nThe Thistle Chapel is simple in form: the Chapel itself consists of three bays and an [[Apse|apsidal]] east end with neither [[aisle]]s nor [[transept]]s. Beneath the Chapel is an [[undercroft]] and adjoining the Chapel is the ante-chapel with arches opening into the Preston Aisle and south choir aisle of the Cathedral and an external east door and steps providing access to [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh|Parliament Square]].\n\nThe chapel sits in a constrained site: on the edge of St Giles' Cathedral at its north and west and constricted by [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh|Parliament Square]] to its south and east; the kirk session of St Giles' Cathedral also required the Chapel should not interfere with services in the Cathedral or block light from the church.<ref name=Savage85>Savage 1980, p. 85.</ref> To create an impression of grandeur, Lorimer designed the Chapel to be unusually tall: the interior of the Chapel, while only 5.5 meters (18 feet) wide and 11.5 meters (36 feet) long, is 13 meters (42 feet) tall.<ref name=GMW118>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 118.</ref><ref name=Boreham20>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 20.</ref>\n\nAt the time of the commission, [[Robert Lorimer]], a former pupil of [[Robert Rowand Anderson]] and [[George Frederick Bodley]], was roughly half-way through his architectural career; though his only major ecclesiastical commission had been [[St Peter%27s Church, Edinburgh|St Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Morningside]].<ref name=Carruthers195>Carruthers 2013, p. 195.</ref> [[John Fraser Matthew]], Lorimer's future partner, assisted Lorimer in the design of the Chapel.<ref name=matthew1078>Matthew 1988, pp. 107-108.</ref><ref name=marshall148>Marshall 2009, p. 148.</ref> Lorimer's design takes inspiration from late 15th century Gothic architecture and, in its form and in its use of [[Tracery#Curvilinear_(flowing)_tracery|curvilinear tracery]], displays the influence of [[George Frederick Bodley]].<ref name=GMW107>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 107.</ref><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 20.</ref><ref name=Gordon30>Gordon 1959, p. 30.</ref><ref name=Savage85/>\n\nThe Chapel is constructed of sandstone from Cullalo in [[Fife]]. The same stone was employed by [[William Burn]] as [[ashlar]] to face the exterior of St Giles' during the restoration of 1829-33 and by [[Robert Reid (architect)|Robert Reid]] for the construction of the Law Courts on the opposite side of [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh|Parliament Square]]. The exterior of the Thistle Chapel therefore appears consistent with St Giles' while complementing  other buildings on Parliament Square.<ref name=marshall148/><ref name=matthew25>Matthew 1988, p. 25.</ref> [[Christopher Hussey]] argued Lorimer was successful in creating a chapel that \"harmonises perfectly with the Cathedral structure as a whole, but fearlessly proclaims its individuality.\"<ref name=Hussey80>Hussey 1931, p. 80.</ref>\n\n===Exterior===\nOn its exterior, the Chapel's base is emphasised by multiple horizontal [[Molding (decorative)|moulded]] [[Course (architecture)|course]], from which rise [[gablet roof|gableted]] [[buttress]]es; the buttresses terminate at the [[cornice]] of the [[Battlement|castellated]] [[parapet]]. The parapet conceals the flat, asphalt-covered concrete roof.<ref name=Boreham22>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 22.</ref> According to [[Christopher Hussey]], the \"pronounced batter of the buttresses\" creates \"an illusion of height and massiveness without\".<ref name=Hussey82>Hussey 1931, p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe buttresses divided the exterior into [[Bay (architecture)| bays]]: between each bay, the [[pedestal|plinth]], pierced by [[dormer]]-like ventilation holes (now glazed), slopes steeply to a sheer wall surface below a [[tracery|traceried]] [[lancet window]]. This sloping plinth was likely inspired by chapels at the east end of [[Chartres Cathedral]].<ref name=GMW107/><ref name=Carruthers195/> On the cornice above each window, a demi-angel bears a shield while below each window is the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and [[coronet]] of each Knight at the time of Chapel's construction corresponding to the arms depicted in the window.<ref name=GMW107/><ref name=Boreham22/> The [[Tracery#Curvilinear_(flowing)_tracery|curvilinear tracery]] of these windows evokes the surviving medieval tracery of St Giles'.<ref name=Hussey82/> At the east end, the parapet rises to accommodate a canopied niche, in which stands a statue of Saint Andrew.<ref name=GMW108>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 108.</ref>\n\nAt the west end, an octagonal [[turret]], capped with a [[Spire|spirelet]], stands in the south corner: this contains a spiral staircase, which leads to the roof.<ref name=Boreham22/> The west window is in the form of an [[oriel window|oriel]] and the west [[gable]] is [[stepped gable|crow-stepped]].<ref name=GMW108/>\n\nBetween the south wall of Saint Giles and the north side of the Chapel, a wide flight of steps rises to the east door, which leads to the ante-chapel. The round-arched doorway dates to the 15th century and originally stood at the south entrance to St Giles'. At the restoration of 1829-1833, [[William Burn]] reincorporated the doorway as part of an internal partition wall. When the Cathedral's partition walls were demolished during the restoration of 1871-1883, [[William Hay (architect)|William Hay]] reconstructed the door at the royal entrance at the east end of the church. The royal entrance was constructed during the Burn restoration and consisted of a chamber accessed by a flight of steps. During the construction of the Thistle Chapel, the royal entrance was demolished and replaced by the ante-chapel while the doorway was retained and reincorporated as the entrance to the ante-chapel.<ref name=GMW108/><ref name=R33>RCAHMS 1951, p. 33.</ref> Above the door rests a heavy heraldic [[frieze]] under an uninterrupted parapet.<ref name=GMW108/>\n\n===Interior===\n====Ante-chapel====\nThe ante-chapel is 7.6 meters (25 feet) long and 4.3 meters (14 feet) wide; it consists of two bays: in the west end and north west bay stand arches opening into St Giles' Cathedral, the external doorway occupies the eastern wall, and in the south west bay, a [[Foil (architecture)|cusped]] [[Four-centred arch|Tudor arch]] with angels on the cusps frames both the off-centre door to the Chapel and an inscription and heraldic [[relief]] in memory of [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]]. On the walls of the two eastern bays are inscribed the names of the Sovereigns and Knights from the foundation of the order in 1687 to the construction of the Chapel in 1909.<ref name=GMW1178>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, pp. 117-118.</ref><ref name=Savage85/><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 31.</ref> Around the east door stands an interior glass porch added in 1983 by Simpson and Brown.<ref name=Boreham23/>\n\nThe ceiling of the ante-chapel consists of a shallow [[lierne (vault)|lierne]] vault, heavy with foliate [[boss (architecture)|bosses]]; the central bosses depict [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and the [[Lion Rampant]]. There are 57 bosses and over 70 tons of stone in the ante-chapel ceiling.<ref name=Boreham33>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 33.</ref><ref name=Nicol24>Nicol 1998, p. 24.</ref>\n\nThe preconditions for the design of the Chapel required the ante-chapel to be low in order to prevent the obstruction of light from the windows of the Cathedral. Lorimer took advantage of this requirement by creating a close, sombre ante-chapel to emphasise, by contrast, the soaring proportions of the Chapel.<ref name=Boreham22/><ref>Nicol 1998, p. 10.</ref><ref>Hussey 1931, pp. 81-82.</ref>\n====Chapel====\nThe interior of the Chapel consists of three bays, an [[Apse|apsidal]] east end and a flat west end. Above the line of the stalls rise pointed windows; the single-light east window is flanked by angels. At the west end, a single [[Oriel window|oriel]] is framed by a [[Foil (architecture)|cusped]] [[lancet window|lancet]]. In the north-west two bays [[Tracery#Blind_and_open_tracery|blind tracery]] imitates the form of the windows and frames reliefs of the arms of [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|the Duke of Argyll]], [[Douglas Graham, 5th Duke of Montrose|the Duke of Montrose]], [[James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford|the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres]], and [[William Hay, 10th Marquess of Tweeddale|the Marquess of Tweeddale]].<ref name=Boreham23/><ref name=Boreham32>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 32.</ref>\n\nA shallow [[lierne (vault)|lierne]]-vaulted ceiling crowns the soaring interior of the Chapel. While the ceiling's height contrasts with the ceiling of the ante-chapel, its design is similar with large [[boss (architecture)|bosses]] dominating the ceiling. At the key-stone of each bay rests a demi-angel playing a different musical instrument. These musical angels were likely inspired by similar examples at [[Melrose Abbey]] and [[Rosslyn Chapel]].<ref name=Boreham32/> Between foliate [[Boss (architecture)|bosses]] \u2013 many of which depict national flowers of the countries of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] \u2013 a stage of bosses take the form of angels bearing the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheons]] of the eight Knights at the time of the Order\u2019s foundation and the six Knights added by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. The massive central bosses depict, from west to east, the [[Royal arms of Scotland]], [[Saint Giles]], the star of the Order of the Thistle, [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]], and [[Pelican#Christianity|the Pelican in her piety]].<ref name=Boreham32/><ref name=Hussey83>Hussey 1931, p. 83.</ref> Lorimer believed the art of vaulting reached its zenith in the [[English_Gothic_architecture#Perpendicular_Gothic|Perpendicular period]] and designed the vault in that style; at the same time, he employed large, robust bosses to evoke Scottish medieval architecture.<ref name=Hussey83/> Likewise, Lorimer's preference for heraldic angels and foliate bosses may have been inspired by similar stonework in the adjoining Preston Aisle of St Giles'.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 31-32.</ref> There are 98 bosses over 200 tons of sandstone in the Chapel ceiling; the larger bosses weigh over a ton each.<ref name=Boreham32/><ref name=Nicol24/><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 33.</ref>\n\n==Stonework==\nThe contract for stonework went to A. Colville & Co., whose yard was at [[Haymarket, Edinburgh|Haymarket]]. The carvings were done by Jospeh Hayes \u2013 with whom Lorimer had already collaborated \u2013 and his men, initially overseen by the foreman Thomas Somerville, who died during the construction. Over 1000 tons of stone was sculpted at the yard then transported over a mile by horse and cart to St Giles\u2019, where some final work was done as the stones were put in place.<ref name=Boreham31>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 31.</ref> Although Hayes and his men displayed independence in developing designs, Lorimer claimed ultimate authorship, insisting the masons \u201cget their cure from him\u201d.<ref name=Savage86>Savage 1980, p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe most detailed carving was done by \u201cthe Greek\u201d, whose name is not otherwise known. Among the other members of Hayes\u2019 team was [[Alexander Carrick]], who became a noted sculptor in his own right. [[Louis Deuchars]] created plaster models from which Hayes and his men worked.<ref name=Boreham31/> Heraldic devices were emblazoned by Alfred Nixon of Moxon & Carfare.<ref name=Boreham33/>\n\nThe floor of the Chapel is [[Ailsa Craig]] [[granite]] with panels of [[Iona]] [[marble]]. This was laid by Allan & Sons of [[Piershill]]. On 4 July 1962, a memorial floor plaque to [[George VI]], designed by [[Esm\u00e9 Gordon]], was unveiled by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]]. The plaque was made by Stewart McGlashan & Sons of [[Canonmills]] and consists of a panel of granite with a [[bronze]] border and lettering; the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]] are formed by inlaid pieces of marble.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 37.</ref><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 46.</ref>\nIn 1927, [[Pilkington Jackson]] carved the names of the Knights and Sovereigns of the Order of the Thistle from 1687 to 1909 in the walls of the ante-chapel.<ref name=Boreham33/>\n==Woodwork==\nThe contract for the oak interior woodwork was given to the company of Nathaniel Grieve of Washinton Lane, [[Dalry, Edinburgh|Dalry]]. Grieve\u2019s workmen executed the wood panelling and foliate borders. The most detailed woodwork was carved by the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]]-based brothers, William and Alexander Clow, mostly from designs by [[Louis Deuchars]].<ref name=matthew1078/><ref name=marshall148/><ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 45.</ref> The Clow borthers worked almost exclusively for Lorimer.<ref>Savage 1980, p. 86-87.</ref>\n\nLorimer based the design of the Knights\u2019 stalls on those at [[St George%27s Chapel, Windsor]]. Each stall is flanked by an animal on the arm-rest: some of these were based on animals that appear in the arms of the Knights and were carved by the Clow brothers from rough sketches by Lorimer. Each arm-rest bears a twisting pillar that support a canopy over the stall; on each of the cusps of these canopies is an angel with twin angels above the cusps of the Sovereign\u2019s stall, between the canopies are angels playing musical instruments. Deuchars designed each angel to be unique in appearance.<ref name=Boreham4549>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 45-49.</ref>\n\nAbove each canopy are three canopied niches. The niches of the Sovereign\u2019s stall contains sculptures of [[Saint Mungo]], [[Saint Margaret of Scotland]], and [[Saint Columba]]. Above the niches of each stall are tall, [[crocket|crocketed]] [[spire]]s surmounted by the [[coronet]], [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of each Knight.<ref name=Boreham4549/> A decorative sword stands in line with each spire: these were sculpted by Beveridge of Scott Morton & Co. and painted by Moxon & Carfrae.<ref name=Boreham51>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe Sovereign\u2019s stall at the centre of the western end is especially intricate: its spire is 10 meters (33 feet) tall while the two stalls on either side of it \u2013 which are reserved for royal Knights \u2013 descend in height to the Knights\u2019 stalls, which are 7.6 meters (25 feet) tall.<ref name=Savage86/> The book rest in front of the Sovereign\u2019s stall bears a large panel with the full achievement of the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]]; on the ends are the escutcheons of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and [[James II of England|James VII]].<ref>Gordon 1959, p. 28.</ref>\nThe [[Dado (architecture)|dado]] of the [[Apse|apsidal]] east end is panelled and surmounted by a continuous canopy of [[ogee]] arches below a pierced [[parapet]]. The panelling of the central section above the holy table is the most detailed and contains a sculpture of an allegorical winged figure defeating a dragon which represents evil.<ref name=Boreham49>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 49.</ref> This may represent [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret of Antioch]].<ref name=Matthew103>Matthew 1988, p. 103.</ref>\n\nMoxon & Carfrae of [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]] painted and stained the wood; the company subsequently held the contract to maintain the woodwork.<ref name=Boreham51/>\n===Furniture===\nA number of pieces of free-standing wooden furniture were added at the time of the Chapel\u2019s construction: these are the Dean\u2019s chair and book rest and the [[lectern]] and reader\u2019s seat. A [[credence table]] table, designed by Lorimer and carved by Nathaniel Grieve, was added in 1920; this stands in the north alcove of the apse.<ref name=Boreham51/> The table was produced to coincide with [[Graham baronets|Sir John Hatt Noble Graham\u2019s]] donation of a silver [[chalice]] and [[paten]] from the collection [[Ferdinand II of Portugal]].<ref name=Burnett69>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 69.</ref> Nathaniel Grieve also provided an attendant\u2019s seat and desk for the ante-chapel in 1927.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 52.</ref> Scott Morton & Co. provided eight oak stools in 1934.<ref name=Burnett69/>\n\nAs a memorial to [[George V]], a communion table with a short [[retable]] was commissioned from Scott Morton & Co. and designed by [[John Fraser Matthew]]. The front of the table shows the [[Lamb of God]] and the retable bears emblems of each person of the [[Trinity]]. The table replaced the chair of investiture at the east end of the Chapel. The unveiling of the table by [[George VI]] was intended for autumn 1939; however, the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] meant this was delayed until July 1943.<ref>Matthew 1988, pp. 44, 46.</ref><ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 52.</ref>\n===Crests===\nAtop the spire above each Knight\u2019s seat is a sculpted [[coronet]] and [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] and the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the incumbent Knight. Whenever a Knight dies and another Knight is appointed in his/her place, the deceased Knight\u2019s crest is replaced with that of their successor.<ref>Matthew 1988, pp. 37-38, 43.</ref>\n\nBetween the construction of the Chapel and the firm\u2019s liquidation in 1966, the crests were carved by the foreman carver of Scott Morton & Co. of Edinburgh. Moxon & Crafrae originally coloured the crests but by the time of Scott Morton & Co.\u2019s dissolution, this was done by A.C. Wood & Son. Whytock and Reid then held the contract to carve the crests until 1983; since then, the work has been done by John Donaldson of Livingston.<ref name=Boreham51/><ref name=Burnett11/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jdonaldsoncarver.co.uk/heraldic.html|title='Heraldic: a history in solid form\u2019|website=jdonaldsoncarver.co.uk|access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Stained Glass==\nThe Trustees encouraged [[Robert Lorimer]] to employ a Scottish artist for the Chapel\u2019s stained glass; but Lorimer favoured the London-based stained glass designer, [[Louis Davis]]. As a compromise, Davis was commissioned to design seven windows to show the [[Coat of arms|arms]] of the Knights at the time of the Chapel\u2019s construction while the Scottish artist, Douglas Strachan, was commissioned to design the east window, depicting [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]].<ref name=Cumming39/><ref name=matthew1078/><ref name=marshall148/>\n\nEach heraldic window is split into two main lights by a central [[mullion]] with a coat of arms in each light. Lorimer insisted the arms be framed by clear glass to allow light into the Chapel.<ref>Savage 1980, p. 87.</ref> For the clear glass, Davis, in common with other stained glass artists of the Arts and Crafts movement, preferred imperfect \u2018brown\u2019 glass to entirely transparent \u2018factory\u2019 glass.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 39-42.</ref> In the top light of each window is a [[zodiac]] sign: these were designed by Davis\u2019 frequent collaborator, [[Karl Parsons]].<ref name=Cumming42>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 42.</ref>\n\nGoing clockwise the north side, the arms depicted are as follows: [[Lawrence Dundas, 1st Marquess of Zetland|the Marquess of Zetland]] and [[Charles Gore Hay, 20th Earl of Erroll|the Earl of Erroll]]; [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|the Marquess of Aberdeen]] and [[Gavin Hamilton, 2nd Baron Hamilton of Dalzell|Lord Hamilton of Dalzell]]; [[Henry John Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe|the Duke of Roxburghe]] and [[George Baillie-Hamilton-Arden, 11th Earl of Haddington|the Earl of Haddington]]; [[Alexander Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Lord Balfour of Burleigh]] and [[Charles Douglas-Home, 12th Earl of Home|the Earl of Home]]; [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|the Earl of Rosebery]] and [[Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife|the Duke of Fife]]; and [[William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch|the Duke of Buccleuch]] and [[John Stewart-Murray, 7th Duke of Atholl|the Duke of Atholl]]. The single-light west window, also by Davis, shows the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]].<ref name=Cumming42/>\n\nStrachan\u2019s single-light east window depicts [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] above the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]] and beneath two angles who bear [[Saltire|his cross]] and [[Crown_of_Immortality#Crown_of_martyrdom|martyr\u2019s crown]]. Unusually, Andrew is depicted in his career as a fisherman rather than at his martyrdom; as described by Elizabeth Cumming: \u201cStrachan\u2019s figure holds a natural pose, and presents Andrew as a rugged, working fisherman, his net firmly held in his arms\u201d.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 43.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, small stained glass windows replaced the ventilation grilles in the former boiler room below the Chapel; these were designed by Christian Shaw and depict the days of creation.<ref name=GMW118/><ref>Nicol 1998, p. 49.</ref>\n==Metalwork==\nThe wrought-iron gates of the ante-chapel and the iron components of the Chapel's doors were forged by Thomas Hadden and his workshop at [[Roseburn]]. Hadden based the design of the gates on medieval [[rood screen]]s. Hadden had previously collaborated with Lorimer on [[Earlshall Castle]] and [[Ardkinglas]].<ref>Matthew 1988, p. 29.</ref><ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 61-62</ref>\n\nHadden's forge also contributed the bronze curtain rails at the east end and the [[helmet (heraldry)|helms]] atop each Knight's stall. The [[coronets]] below the helms were made by T.K. Ebbutt of Hanover Street in the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] and painted by Moxon & Carfrae.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 62.</ref><ref name=Boreham67>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 67.</ref> Ebbutt also made ceremonial keys for the Chapel, which show [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] on the bow.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 66-67.</ref>\n\nPendant electric lamps were produced by the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] and based on models by [[Louis Deuchars]]. These consist of angels bearing torches above a pendant showing [[Pelican#Christianity|the Pelican in her piety]]. During the remodelling of the east end in 1939, a new lamp was supplied by Charles Henshaw of Edinburgh. Over the years, the pendants went missing and one lamp was stolen; in 2006, Powderhall Bronze of Edinburgh manufactured replacements. The Bromsgrove Guild also produced the handles and keyhole [[Escutcheon (furniture)|escutcheon]] for the Chapel door.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 65.</ref>\n\nAlongside the communion table unveiled in 1943, a silvered bronze cross was added at the east end. Designed by [[John Fraser Matthew]], the cross features square [[Vitreous enamel|enamelled]] panels at each end, showing the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]]: these panels were designed by [[Morris Meredith Williams]] and enamelled by Harold Conrad William Soper of London.<ref name=Boreham67/>\nArchitectural metalwork by other firms includes door locks and hinges by Low & Methven of [[Lothian Road]] and external lead piping by W.

As senior Knights died and new Knights were appointed, the Knights moved up stalls in order of seniority and their stall plate moved with them: this has resulted in a concentration of the original plates at the western end of the Chapel. Since the 1920s, individual Knights' stall plates have remained on the same stalls, regardless of seniority.<ref name=Burnett810>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2001, pp. 8-10.</ref>\n\nThe earliest stall plates in the Chapel are the work of [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]]. At the time of the Chapel's construction, Traquair was well-established in Scotland's [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] scene.<ref name=Burnett8/> Despite his being close friends with Traquair, [[Robert Lorimer]] initially desired Harold Conrad William Soper of London to produce the enamel stall plates; however, [[Sir Herbert Maxwell, 7th Baronet|Herbert Maxwell]], on behalf of the Trustees, recommend Lorimer engage Traquair as an Edinburgh-based artist.<ref>Savage 1980, p. 88.</ref> According to [[Charles Burnett (officer of arms)|Charles Burnett]], Traquair's stall plates are \"quite unlike any chivalric stall plates seen before\". Working at her home studio in [[Colinton]], Traquair used the [[champlev\u00e9]] technique, setting [[vitreous enamel]] over foil to create shimmering, jewel-like surfaces.<ref name=Burnett810>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2001, pp. 8-10.</ref><ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 58-59.</ref>\n[[James Balfour Paul]], [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], preferred the \"cut-out\" style of stall plate used for the earliest Garter plates at Windsor: this showed the arms without any background or frame and has been followed since 1911, giving a unique consistency to the Thistle stall plates. Paul also ordered that, in complex cases of [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartering]], only the first quarter be shown.<ref name=Burnett8>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2001, p. 8.</ref><ref>Roads in Blair et al. 2009, p. 29.</ref>\n\nTraquair produced the nineteen stall plates required for the Chapel in 1911. After 1911, the stall plates were produced by Elizabeth Kirkwood, who was influenced by Traquair's technique and who also introduced modelling to the [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] and [[mantling]] of the arms to give them a three-dimensional effect.<ref name=Burnett10/> Since 1963, the arms have been produced by A.

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within [[St Giles%27 Cathedral]]. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork.  [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Holyrood Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|300px|The interior of Holyrood Abbey as the chapel of the Order of the Thistle]]\n===Holyrood Abbey===\n\nOn 29 May 1687, [[James II of England|James VII]] founded the [[Order of the Thistle]] and issued a warrant to designate [[Holyrood Abbey]] the chapel of the new order. This change of purpose necessitated the eventual removal of the Abbey's [[Church of Scotland]] congregation to the [[Canongate Kirk]].<ref name=Burnett9>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 9.</ref>\n\nIn the seventeen months after the publication of the warrant, [[William Bruce (architect)|William Bruce]] oversaw the transformation of the Abbey: an altar and black and white marble floor were added and classical stalls were shipped from London. The Order of the Thistle never met in its new chapel: on 10 December 1688, in the wake of [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]], a mob from Edinburgh destroyed the furnishings.<ref name=Burnett9/><ref name=BurnettHodgson6>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2000, p. 6.</ref>\n\n===Proposals for a new chapel===\n\nAlthough the order was revived in 1703 by [[Anne of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], no chapel was designated. In 1728, the antiquarian William Douglas suggested the ruins of St Rule's Church in the grounds of [[St Andrews Cathedral]] be restored as a chapel for the order.<ref name=Burnett9/>\nProposals to locate the chapel of the Order in St Giles' go back to 1872, when Secretary of the Order corresponded with the committee for the then-ongoing restoration of the church. In 1879 and 1882, Lindsay Mackersy, session clerk of the High Kirk, and the [[Session (Presbyterianism)|kirk session]]  proposed the south transept of St Giles' as a chapel for the Order. None of these proposals proved practical.<ref name=BurnettHodgson6/><ref>Marshall 2009, pp. 128-129.</ref><ref name=Burnett910>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 9-10.</ref>\n\nIn 1836, [[James Gillespie Graham]] and [[Augustus Pugin]] had drawn up plans to restore Holyrood Abbey as the chapel of the Order. Although Graham and Pugin's plans were not acted upon at the time, the same ambition was advanced in 1905, when [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] set up a fund of \u00a340,000 to restore Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle.<ref name=Burnett910/> On investigation by [[MacGibbon and Ross|Thomas Ross]], the restoration of Holyrood Abbey was found to be impossible.<ref name=BurnettHodgson6/><ref name=Burnett10>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 10.</ref>\n\n===Construction===\nUpon the Earl's death in 1906, the fund reverted to his sons, who offered \u00a322,000 and an endowment of \u00a32,000 to construct a new chapel.<ref name=Burnett10/><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 19.</ref> [[Edward VII]] appointed [[William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch]]; [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery]]; [[John David Melville, 12th Earl of Leven]]; and [[Schomberg Kerr McDonnell]] as trustees with [[MacGibbon and Ross|Thomas Ross]] as architectural consultant. The King instructed to the Trustees to write to the kirk session of St. Giles' with the suggestion that a new chapel for the Order be housed in the Cathedral; on 12 March 1909, the Cathedral authorities gratefully accepted this offer. The Trustees appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The King approved Lorimer's plans and the first building contract was signed on 24 August 1909 with the foundation stone being laid on 6 November that year.<ref name=Burnett10/><ref>Matthew 1988, pp. 19-21.</ref><ref>Marshall 2009, p. 147.</ref>\n\nThe Chapel was completed by the autumn of 1910 in time for the first St Andrew's Day gathering of the Knights. The Chapel was formally opened amidst much ceremony on 19 July 1911 by [[George V]].<ref >Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 10-11.</ref> At the opening, police hid in the boiler room beneath the Chapel to guard against the threat of vandalism by [[suffragette]]s. At the end of the ceremony, the king received the Chapel's craftspeople and Lorimer was shortly afterwards knighted for his work.<ref name=Burnett11>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 11.</ref><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 21.</ref>\n\nThe Trustees insisted that \"the Thistle Chapel is a national thing\" and that, as such, preference should be shown to Scottish artisans.<ref name=Cumming39>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 39.</ref> In line with the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]'s emphasis on craftsmanship and collaboration, Lorimer had already assembled a largely Edinburgh-based team of artisans. Of the major contributors to the Chapel, only [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who designed the heraldic stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied decorative metalwork \u2013 were based outside Scotland.<ref name=Boreham16>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 16.</ref><ref>Carruthers 2013, pp. 277-278.</ref> The speed with which the Chapel was completed is, in large part, due to the skill of this team of craftspeople.<ref name=Burnett11/>\n\n===Subsequent history===\nThe former boiler room in the [[undercroft]] of the Chapel was redeveloped in 1982 by [[Bernard Feilden]] and Simpson & Brown.<ref name=Boreham23>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 23.</ref> Between 1987 and 2019, a cafe occupied the space immediately below the Chapel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/lifestyle/last-supper-edinburghs-st-giles-kirk-cafe-closes-after-30-years-638803|title='Last supper at Edinburgh's St Giles as kirk cafe closes after 30 years'|website=edinburghnews.scotsman.com|access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref> \n\nOver four months in 2006, a major cleaning and preservation operation was undertaken by the firm of Charles Taylor: this was the first thorough maintenance project in the Chapel's history.<ref>Marshall 2009, p. 190.</ref>\n\nThe Thistle Chapel was temporarily closed to visitors from February 2015 after a number of valuable items were stolen.

Beneath the Chapel is an [[undercroft]] and adjoining the Chapel is the ante-chapel with arches opening into the Preston Aisle and south choir aisle of the Cathedral and an external east door and steps providing access to [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh|Parliament Square]].\n\nThe chapel sits in a constrained site: on the edge of St Giles' Cathedral at its north and west and constricted by [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh|Parliament Square]] to its south and east; the kirk session of St Giles' Cathedral also required the Chapel should not interfere with services in the Cathedral or block light from the church.<ref name=Savage85>Savage 1980, p. 85.</ref> To create an impression of grandeur, Lorimer designed the Chapel to be unusually tall: the interior of the Chapel, while only 5.5 meters (18 feet) wide and 11.5 meters (36 feet) long, is 13 meters (42 feet) tall.<ref name=GMW118>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 118.</ref><ref name=Boreham20>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 20.</ref>\n\nAt the time of the commission, [[Robert Lorimer]], a former pupil of [[Robert Rowand Anderson]] and [[George Frederick Bodley]], was roughly half-way through his architectural career; though his only major ecclesiastical commission had been [[St Peter%27s Church, Edinburgh|St Peter's Roman Catholic Church, Morningside]].<ref name=Carruthers195>Carruthers 2013, p. 195.</ref> [[John Fraser Matthew]], Lorimer's future partner, assisted Lorimer in the design of the Chapel.<ref name=matthew1078>Matthew 1988, pp. 107-108.</ref><ref name=marshall148>Marshall 2009, p. 148.</ref> Lorimer's design takes inspiration from late 15th century Gothic architecture and, in its form and in its use of [[Tracery#Curvilinear_(flowing)_tracery|curvilinear tracery]], displays the influence of [[George Frederick Bodley]].<ref name=GMW107>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 107.</ref><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 20.</ref><ref name=Gordon30>Gordon 1959, p. 30.</ref><ref name=Savage85/>\n\nThe Chapel is constructed of sandstone from Cullalo in [[Fife]]. The same stone was employed by [[William Burn]] as [[ashlar]] to face the exterior of St Giles' during the restoration of 1829-33 and by [[Robert Reid (architect)|Robert Reid]] for the construction of the Law Courts on the opposite side of [[Parliament Square, Edinburgh|Parliament Square]]. The exterior of the Thistle Chapel therefore appears consistent with St Giles' while complementing  other buildings on Parliament Square.<ref name=marshall148/><ref name=matthew25>Matthew 1988, p. 25.</ref> [[Christopher Hussey]] argued Lorimer was successful in creating a chapel that \"harmonises perfectly with the Cathedral structure as a whole, but fearlessly proclaims its individuality.\"<ref name=Hussey80>Hussey 1931, p. 80.</ref>\n\n===Exterior===\nOn its exterior, the Chapel's base is emphasised by multiple horizontal [[Molding (decorative)|moulded]] [[Course (architecture)|course]], from which rise [[gablet roof|gableted]] [[buttress]]es; the buttresses terminate at the [[cornice]] of the [[Battlement|castellated]] [[parapet]]. The parapet conceals the flat, asphalt-covered concrete roof.<ref name=Boreham22>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 22.</ref> According to [[Christopher Hussey]], the \"pronounced batter of the buttresses\" creates \"an illusion of height and massiveness without\".<ref name=Hussey82>Hussey 1931, p. 82.</ref>\n\nThe buttresses divided the exterior into [[Bay (architecture)| bays]]: between each bay, the [[pedestal|plinth]], pierced by [[dormer]]-like ventilation holes (now glazed), slopes steeply to a sheer wall surface below a [[tracery|traceried]] [[lancet window]]. This sloping plinth was likely inspired by chapels at the east end of [[Chartres Cathedral]].<ref name=GMW107/><ref name=Carruthers195/> On the cornice above each window, a demi-angel bears a shield while below each window is the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] and [[coronet]] of each Knight at the time of Chapel's construction corresponding to the arms depicted in the window.<ref name=GMW107/><ref name=Boreham22/> The [[Tracery#Curvilinear_(flowing)_tracery|curvilinear tracery]] of these windows evokes the surviving medieval tracery of St Giles'.<ref name=Hussey82/> At the east end, the parapet rises to accommodate a canopied niche, in which stands a statue of Saint Andrew.<ref name=GMW108>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 108.</ref>\n\nAt the west end, an octagonal [[turret]], capped with a [[Spire|spirelet]], stands in the south corner: this contains a spiral staircase, which leads to the roof.<ref name=Boreham22/> The west window is in the form of an [[oriel window|oriel]] and the west [[gable]] is [[stepped gable|crow-stepped]].<ref name=GMW108/>\n\nBetween the south wall of Saint Giles and the north side of the Chapel, a wide flight of steps rises to the east door, which leads to the ante-chapel. The round-arched doorway dates to the 15th century and originally stood at the south entrance to St Giles'. At the restoration of 1829-1833, [[William Burn]] reincorporated the doorway as part of an internal partition wall. When the Cathedral's partition walls were demolished during the restoration of 1871-1883, [[William Hay (architect)|William Hay]] reconstructed the door at the royal entrance at the east end of the church. The royal entrance was constructed during the Burn restoration and consisted of a chamber accessed by a flight of steps. During the construction of the Thistle Chapel, the royal entrance was demolished and replaced by the ante-chapel while the doorway was retained and reincorporated as the entrance to the ante-chapel.<ref name=GMW108/><ref name=R33>RCAHMS 1951, p. 33.</ref> Above the door rests a heavy heraldic [[frieze]] under an uninterrupted parapet.<ref name=GMW108/>\n\n===Interior===\n====Ante-chapel====\nThe ante-chapel is 7.6 meters (25 feet) long and 4.3 meters (14 feet) wide; it consists of two bays: in the west end and north west bay stand arches opening into St Giles' Cathedral, the external doorway occupies the eastern wall, and in the south west bay, a [[Foil (architecture)|cusped]] [[Four-centred arch|Tudor arch]] with angels on the cusps frames both the off-centre door to the Chapel and an inscription and heraldic [[relief]] in memory of [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]]. On the walls of the two eastern bays are inscribed the names of the Sovereigns and Knights from the foundation of the order in 1687 to the construction of the Chapel in 1909.<ref name=GMW1178>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, pp. 117-118.</ref><ref name=Savage85/><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 31.</ref> Around the east door stands an interior glass porch added in 1983 by Simpson and Brown.<ref name=Boreham23/>\n\nThe ceiling of the ante-chapel consists of a shallow [[lierne (vault)|lierne]] vault, heavy with foliate [[boss (architecture)|bosses]]; the central bosses depict [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] and the [[Lion Rampant]]. There are 57 bosses and over 70 tons of stone in the ante-chapel ceiling.<ref name=Boreham33>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 33.</ref><ref name=Nicol24>Nicol 1998, p. 24.</ref>\n\nThe preconditions for the design of the Chapel required the ante-chapel to be low in order to prevent the obstruction of light from the windows of the Cathedral. Lorimer took advantage of this requirement by creating a close, sombre ante-chapel to emphasise, by contrast, the soaring proportions of the Chapel.<ref name=Boreham22/><ref>Nicol 1998, p. 10.</ref><ref>Hussey 1931, pp. 81-82.</ref>\n====Chapel====\nThe interior of the Chapel consists of three bays, an [[Apse|apsidal]] east end and a flat west end. Above the line of the stalls rise pointed windows; the single-light east window is flanked by angels. At the west end, a single [[Oriel window|oriel]] is framed by a [[Foil (architecture)|cusped]] [[lancet window|lancet]]. In the north-west two bays [[Tracery#Blind_and_open_tracery|blind tracery]] imitates the form of the windows and frames reliefs of the arms of [[John Campbell, 9th Duke of Argyll|the Duke of Argyll]], [[Douglas Graham, 5th Duke of Montrose|the Duke of Montrose]], [[James Lindsay, 26th Earl of Crawford|the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres]], and [[William Hay, 10th Marquess of Tweeddale|the Marquess of Tweeddale]].<ref name=Boreham23/><ref name=Boreham32>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 32.</ref>\n\nA shallow [[lierne (vault)|lierne]]-vaulted ceiling crowns the soaring interior of the Chapel. While the ceiling's height contrasts with the ceiling of the ante-chapel, its design is similar with large [[boss (architecture)|bosses]] dominating the ceiling. At the key-stone of each bay rests a demi-angel playing a different musical instrument. These musical angels were likely inspired by similar examples at [[Melrose Abbey]] and [[Rosslyn Chapel]].<ref name=Boreham32/> Between foliate [[Boss (architecture)|bosses]] \u2013 many of which depict national flowers of the countries of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] \u2013 a stage of bosses take the form of angels bearing the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheons]] of the eight Knights at the time of the Order\u2019s foundation and the six Knights added by [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. The massive central bosses depict, from west to east, the [[Royal arms of Scotland]], [[Saint Giles]], the star of the Order of the Thistle, [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]], and [[Pelican#Christianity|the Pelican in her piety]].<ref name=Boreham32/><ref name=Hussey83>Hussey 1931, p. 83.</ref> Lorimer believed the art of vaulting reached its zenith in the [[English_Gothic_architecture#Perpendicular_Gothic|Perpendicular period]] and designed the vault in that style; at the same time, he employed large, robust bosses to evoke Scottish medieval architecture.<ref name=Hussey83/> Likewise, Lorimer's preference for heraldic angels and foliate bosses may have been inspired by similar stonework in the adjoining Preston Aisle of St Giles'.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 31-32.</ref> There are 98 bosses over 200 tons of sandstone in the Chapel ceiling; the larger bosses weigh over a ton each.<ref name=Boreham32/><ref name=Nicol24/><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 33.</ref>\n\n==Stonework==\nThe contract for stonework went to A. Colville & Co., whose yard was at [[Haymarket, Edinburgh|Haymarket]]. The carvings were done by Jospeh Hayes \u2013 with whom Lorimer had already collaborated \u2013 and his men, initially overseen by the foreman Thomas Somerville, who died during the construction. Over 1000 tons of stone was sculpted at the yard then transported over a mile by horse and cart to St Giles\u2019, where some final work was done as the stones were put in place.<ref name=Boreham31>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 31.</ref> Although Hayes and his men displayed independence in developing designs, Lorimer claimed ultimate authorship, insisting the masons \u201cget their cure from him\u201d.<ref name=Savage86>Savage 1980, p. 86.</ref>\n\nThe most detailed carving was done by \u201cthe Greek\u201d, whose name is not otherwise known. Among the other members of Hayes\u2019 team was [[Alexander Carrick]], who became a noted sculptor in his own right. [[Louis Deuchars]] created plaster models from which Hayes and his men worked.<ref name=Boreham31/> Heraldic devices were emblazoned by Alfred Nixon of Moxon & Carfare.<ref name=Boreham33/>\n\nThe floor of the Chapel is [[Ailsa Craig]] [[granite]] with panels of [[Iona]] [[marble]]. This was laid by Allan & Sons of [[Piershill]]. On 4 July 1962, a memorial floor plaque to [[George VI]], designed by [[Esm\u00e9 Gordon]], was unveiled by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]]. The plaque was made by Stewart McGlashan & Sons of [[Canonmills]] and consists of a panel of granite with a [[bronze]] border and lettering; the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]] are formed by inlaid pieces of marble.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 37.</ref><ref>Matthew 1988, p. 46.</ref>\nIn 1927, [[Pilkington Jackson]] carved the names of the Knights and Sovereigns of the Order of the Thistle from 1687 to 1909 in the walls of the ante-chapel.<ref name=Boreham33/>\n==Woodwork==\nThe contract for the oak interior woodwork was given to the company of Nathaniel Grieve of Washinton Lane, [[Dalry, Edinburgh|Dalry]]. Grieve\u2019s workmen executed the wood panelling and foliate borders. The most detailed woodwork was carved by the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]]-based brothers, William and Alexander Clow, mostly from designs by [[Louis Deuchars]].<ref name=matthew1078/><ref name=marshall148/><ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 45.</ref> The Clow borthers worked almost exclusively for Lorimer.<ref>Savage 1980, p. 86-87.</ref>\n\nLorimer based the design of the Knights\u2019 stalls on those at [[St George%27s Chapel, Windsor]]. Each stall is flanked by an animal on the arm-rest: some of these were based on animals that appear in the arms of the Knights and were carved by the Clow brothers from rough sketches by Lorimer. Each arm-rest bears a twisting pillar that support a canopy over the stall; on each of the cusps of these canopies is an angel with twin angels above the cusps of the Sovereign\u2019s stall, between the canopies are angels playing musical instruments. Deuchars designed each angel to be unique in appearance.<ref name=Boreham4549>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 45-49.</ref>\n\nAbove each canopy are three canopied niches. The niches of the Sovereign\u2019s stall contains sculptures of [[Saint Mungo]], [[Saint Margaret of Scotland]], and [[Saint Columba]]. Above the niches of each stall are tall, [[crocket|crocketed]] [[spire]]s surmounted by the [[coronet]], [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] and [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of each Knight.<ref name=Boreham4549/> A decorative sword stands in line with each spire: these were sculpted by Beveridge of Scott Morton & Co. and painted by Moxon & Carfrae.<ref name=Boreham51>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe Sovereign\u2019s stall at the centre of the western end is especially intricate: its spire is 10 meters (33 feet) tall while the two stalls on either side of it \u2013 which are reserved for royal Knights \u2013 descend in height to the Knights\u2019 stalls, which are 7.6 meters (25 feet) tall.<ref name=Savage86/> The book rest in front of the Sovereign\u2019s stall bears a large panel with the full achievement of the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]]; on the ends are the escutcheons of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] and [[James II of England|James VII]].<ref>Gordon 1959, p. 28.</ref>\nThe [[Dado (architecture)|dado]] of the [[Apse|apsidal]] east end is panelled and surmounted by a continuous canopy of [[ogee]] arches below a pierced [[parapet]]. The panelling of the central section above the holy table is the most detailed and contains a sculpture of an allegorical winged figure defeating a dragon which represents evil.<ref name=Boreham49>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 49.</ref> This may represent [[Margaret the Virgin|Saint Margaret of Antioch]].<ref name=Matthew103>Matthew 1988, p. 103.</ref>\n\nMoxon & Carfrae of [[George Street, Edinburgh|George Street]] painted and stained the wood; the company subsequently held the contract to maintain the woodwork.<ref name=Boreham51/>\n===Furniture===\nA number of pieces of free-standing wooden furniture were added at the time of the Chapel\u2019s construction: these are the Dean\u2019s chair and book rest and the [[lectern]] and reader\u2019s seat. A [[credence table]] table, designed by Lorimer and carved by Nathaniel Grieve, was added in 1920; this stands in the north alcove of the apse.<ref name=Boreham51/> The table was produced to coincide with [[Graham baronets|Sir John Hatt Noble Graham\u2019s]] donation of a silver [[chalice]] and [[paten]] from the collection [[Ferdinand II of Portugal]].<ref name=Burnett69>Burnett in Blair et al. 2009, p. 69.</ref> Nathaniel Grieve also provided an attendant\u2019s seat and desk for the ante-chapel in 1927.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 52.</ref> Scott Morton & Co. provided eight oak stools in 1934.<ref name=Burnett69/>\n\nAs a memorial to [[George V]], a communion table with a short [[retable]] was commissioned from Scott Morton & Co. and designed by [[John Fraser Matthew]]. The front of the table shows the [[Lamb of God]] and the retable bears emblems of each person of the [[Trinity]]. The table replaced the chair of investiture at the east end of the Chapel. The unveiling of the table by [[George VI]] was intended for autumn 1939; however, the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] meant this was delayed until July 1943.<ref>Matthew 1988, pp. 44, 46.</ref><ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 52.</ref>\n===Crests===\nAtop the spire above each Knight\u2019s seat is a sculpted [[coronet]] and [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] and the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of the incumbent Knight. Whenever a Knight dies and another Knight is appointed in his/her place, the deceased Knight\u2019s crest is replaced with that of their successor.<ref>Matthew 1988, pp. 37-38, 43.</ref>\n\nBetween the construction of the Chapel and the firm\u2019s liquidation in 1966, the crests were carved by the foreman carver of Scott Morton & Co. of Edinburgh. Moxon & Crafrae originally coloured the crests but by the time of Scott Morton & Co.\u2019s dissolution, this was done by A.C. Wood & Son. Whytock and Reid then held the contract to carve the crests until 1983; since then, the work has been done by John Donaldson of Livingston.<ref name=Boreham51/><ref name=Burnett11/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jdonaldsoncarver.co.uk/heraldic.html|title='Heraldic: a history in solid form\u2019|website=jdonaldsoncarver.co.uk|access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Stained Glass==\nThe Trustees encouraged [[Robert Lorimer]] to employ a Scottish artist for the Chapel\u2019s stained glass; but Lorimer favoured the London-based stained glass designer, [[Louis Davis]]. As a compromise, Davis was commissioned to design seven windows to show the [[Coat of arms|arms]] of the Knights at the time of the Chapel\u2019s construction while the Scottish artist, Douglas Strachan, was commissioned to design the east window, depicting [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]].<ref name=Cumming39/><ref name=matthew1078/><ref name=marshall148/>\n\nEach heraldic window is split into two main lights by a central [[mullion]] with a coat of arms in each light. Lorimer insisted the arms be framed by clear glass to allow light into the Chapel.<ref>Savage 1980, p. 87.</ref> For the clear glass, Davis, in common with other stained glass artists of the Arts and Crafts movement, preferred imperfect \u2018brown\u2019 glass to entirely transparent \u2018factory\u2019 glass.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 39-42.</ref> In the top light of each window is a [[zodiac]] sign: these were designed by Davis\u2019 frequent collaborator, [[Karl Parsons]].<ref name=Cumming42>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 42.</ref>\n\nGoing clockwise the north side, the arms depicted are as follows: [[Lawrence Dundas, 1st Marquess of Zetland|the Marquess of Zetland]] and [[Charles Gore Hay, 20th Earl of Erroll|the Earl of Erroll]]; [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|the Marquess of Aberdeen]] and [[Gavin Hamilton, 2nd Baron Hamilton of Dalzell|Lord Hamilton of Dalzell]]; [[Henry John Innes-Ker, 8th Duke of Roxburghe|the Duke of Roxburghe]] and [[George Baillie-Hamilton-Arden, 11th Earl of Haddington|the Earl of Haddington]]; [[Alexander Bruce, 6th Lord Balfour of Burleigh|Lord Balfour of Burleigh]] and [[Charles Douglas-Home, 12th Earl of Home|the Earl of Home]]; [[Archibald Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|the Earl of Rosebery]] and [[Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife|the Duke of Fife]]; and [[William Montagu Douglas Scott, 6th Duke of Buccleuch|the Duke of Buccleuch]] and [[John Stewart-Murray, 7th Duke of Atholl|the Duke of Atholl]]. The single-light west window, also by Davis, shows the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]].<ref name=Cumming42/>\n\nStrachan\u2019s single-light east window depicts [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] above the [[Royal Arms of Scotland]] and beneath two angles who bear [[Saltire|his cross]] and [[Crown_of_Immortality#Crown_of_martyrdom|martyr\u2019s crown]]. Unusually, Andrew is depicted in his career as a fisherman rather than at his martyrdom; as described by Elizabeth Cumming: \u201cStrachan\u2019s figure holds a natural pose, and presents Andrew as a rugged, working fisherman, his net firmly held in his arms\u201d.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 43.</ref>\n\nIn 1982, small stained glass windows replaced the ventilation grilles in the former boiler room below the Chapel; these were designed by Christian Shaw and depict the days of creation.<ref name=GMW118/><ref>Nicol 1998, p. 49.</ref>\n==Metalwork==\nThe wrought-iron gates of the ante-chapel and the iron components of the Chapel's doors were forged by Thomas Hadden and his workshop at [[Roseburn]]. Hadden based the design of the gates on medieval [[rood screen]]s. Hadden had previously collaborated with Lorimer on [[Earlshall Castle]] and [[Ardkinglas]].<ref>Matthew 1988, p. 29.</ref><ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 61-62</ref>\n\nHadden's forge also contributed the bronze curtain rails at the east end and the [[helmet (heraldry)|helms]] atop each Knight's stall. The [[coronets]] below the helms were made by T.K. Ebbutt of Hanover Street in the [[New Town, Edinburgh|New Town]] and painted by Moxon & Carfrae.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 62.</ref><ref name=Boreham67>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 67.</ref> Ebbutt also made ceremonial keys for the Chapel, which show [[Andrew the Apostle|Saint Andrew]] on the bow.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 66-67.</ref>\n\nPendant electric lamps were produced by the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] and based on models by [[Louis Deuchars]]. These consist of angels bearing torches above a pendant showing [[Pelican#Christianity|the Pelican in her piety]]. During the remodelling of the east end in 1939, a new lamp was supplied by Charles Henshaw of Edinburgh. Over the years, the pendants went missing and one lamp was stolen; in 2006, Powderhall Bronze of Edinburgh manufactured replacements. The Bromsgrove Guild also produced the handles and keyhole [[Escutcheon (furniture)|escutcheon]] for the Chapel door.<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 65.</ref>\n\nAlongside the communion table unveiled in 1943, a silvered bronze cross was added at the east end. Designed by [[John Fraser Matthew]], the cross features square [[Vitreous enamel|enamelled]] panels at each end, showing the symbols of the [[Four Evangelists]]: these panels were designed by [[Morris Meredith Williams]] and enamelled by Harold Conrad William Soper of London.<ref name=Boreham67/>\nArchitectural metalwork by other firms includes door locks and hinges by Low & Methven of [[Lothian Road]] and external lead piping by W. Dodds & Sons of [[West Kilburn]].<ref name=Cumming63>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 63.</ref>\n\n==Stall Plates==\n[[File:Thistle Chapel Stall Plates.jpg|thumb|180px|Stall plates by Phoebe Anna Traquair]] The [[Coat of arms|arms]] of each Knight are represented by plate fixed to the back panel of the Knight's stall.<ref name=matthew1078/> At the death of one Knight, the deceased Knight's plate is retained and a new plate added when a new Knight is appointed.<ref name=marshall148/> This practice is well-established in the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Order of chivalry|orders of chivalry]], similar plaques have been installed for [[Order of the Garter|Knights of the Garter]]at [[St George%27s Chapel, Windsor Castle]] since the 15th century.<ref name=Burnett7>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2001, p. 7.</ref>\n\nInitially, the Knights were seated by date of installation, with the most senior being closest to the Sovereign and royal Knights. As senior Knights died and new Knights were appointed, the Knights moved up stalls in order of seniority and their stall plate moved with them: this has resulted in a concentration of the original plates at the western end of the Chapel. Since the 1920s, individual Knights' stall plates have remained on the same stalls, regardless of seniority.<ref name=Burnett810>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2001, pp. 8-10.</ref>\n\nThe earliest stall plates in the Chapel are the work of [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]]. At the time of the Chapel's construction, Traquair was well-established in Scotland's [[Arts and Crafts movement|Arts and Crafts]] scene.<ref name=Burnett8/> Despite his being close friends with Traquair, [[Robert Lorimer]] initially desired Harold Conrad William Soper of London to produce the enamel stall plates; however, [[Sir Herbert Maxwell, 7th Baronet|Herbert Maxwell]], on behalf of the Trustees, recommend Lorimer engage Traquair as an Edinburgh-based artist.<ref>Savage 1980, p. 88.</ref> According to [[Charles Burnett (officer of arms)|Charles Burnett]], Traquair's stall plates are \"quite unlike any chivalric stall plates seen before\". Working at her home studio in [[Colinton]], Traquair used the [[champlev\u00e9]] technique, setting [[vitreous enamel]] over foil to create shimmering, jewel-like surfaces.<ref name=Burnett810>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2001, pp. 8-10.</ref><ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 58-59.</ref>\n[[James Balfour Paul]], [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]], preferred the \"cut-out\" style of stall plate used for the earliest Garter plates at Windsor: this showed the arms without any background or frame and has been followed since 1911, giving a unique consistency to the Thistle stall plates. Paul also ordered that, in complex cases of [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartering]], only the first quarter be shown.<ref name=Burnett8>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2001, p. 8.</ref><ref>Roads in Blair et al. 2009, p. 29.</ref>\n\nTraquair produced the nineteen stall plates required for the Chapel in 1911. After 1911, the stall plates were produced by Elizabeth Kirkwood, who was influenced by Traquair's technique and who also introduced modelling to the [[Helmet (heraldry)|helm]] and [[mantling]] of the arms to give them a three-dimensional effect.<ref name=Burnett10/> Since 1963, the arms have been produced by A. Kirkwood & Son of Edinburgh; since 1990, [[resin]] has been used instead of enamel.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 59.</ref> The stall plates of [[John Crichton-Stuart, 4th Marquess of Bute|the Marquess of Bute]] (1922) and [[David Lindsay, 28th Earl of Crawford|the Earl of Crawford and Balcarres]] (1955) are the work of Harold Conrad William Soper of London.<ref name=Burnett11/>\n\nAll heraldic details in the chapel were based on drawings by John Sutherland, who produced designs for stall plates until 1928. Since then, the stall plates have usually been designed by the incumbent Herald Painter to the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]].<ref>Burnett in Burnett and Hodgson 2001, pp. 7-10.</ref><ref>Roads in Blair et al. 2009, pp. 28-29.</ref>\n\n==Textiles==\n[[File:Edinburgh - St Giles&#039; Cathedral - 20140421140529.jpg|thumb|Knights' banners in the Preston Aisle of St Giles' Cathedral]]\nAt the Chapel's construction, Nell Kay Drew of Edinburgh produced [[mantling]] to hang from the helms atop each Knight's stall. The mantling above the Knights' stalls is [[damask]] with [[cloth of gold]] mantling above the royal stalls.<ref>Cumming in Blair et al. 2009, p. 63.</ref> Whytock & Reid of Edinburgh supplied two sets of [[brocade]] curtains for the east end: one set, in green, is for everyday use and the other, in red, is for use during the services of the Order.<ref name=Boreham67/>\n\nIn 1935, Captain William Dunn donated an old Spanish altar cloth to the [[Dean of the Thistle]], [[Charles Warr]]; this cloth is the property of the Order and is held in the custody of St Giles'.<ref name=Burnett69/>\n\nAt the opening in 1911, no satisfactory way was found in which to hang the Knights' [[banner]]s inside the Chapel.

Ranald MacInnes, Miles Glendinning, and Aonghus MacKechnie identify the Thistle Chapel as \"the most emphatic example of the nationalist trend in church architecture\". MacInnes, Glendinning, and MacKechnie contrast the Chapel's \"ecclesiastical lavishness\" and \"[[Rosslyn Chapel|Rosslyn]]-like elaboration\" with [[John James Burnet]]'s \"simpler evocation of archaic monumentality\" and [[Ramsay Traquair]] and [[Reginald Fairlie]]'s revival of the neo-[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] trend in 15th century Scottish church architecture.<ref name=MGM372>MacInnes, Glendinning, MacKechnie 1996, p. 372.</ref><ref name=MGM89>MacInnes, Glendinning, MacKechnie 1999, p. 89.</ref>\n\nAlongside its importance as a Gothic building, the Thistle Chapel is, in Louise Boreham's words, \"an exquisite jewel of the entire [[Arts and Crafts movement]].\"<ref>Boreham in Blair et al. 2009, p. 16.</ref> Commentators including Annette Carruthers; MacInnes, Glendinning, and MacKechnie; Savage; and the authors of the [[Pevsner Architectural Guides|Buildings of Scotland series]] note that the overall effect of the Thistle Chapel is achieved, not solely through Lorimer's design, but through \"Traditionalist crafts collaboration\": the essence of the Arts and Crafts movement.<ref name=Carruthers195/><ref name=Savage86/><ref name=MGM372/><ref name=GMW117>Gifford, McWilliam, Walker 1984, p. 117.</ref>\n\nA number of commentators also recognise the national and political significance of the Chapel.

The proposal elicited support from [[Bengali Hindu]] leaders [[Sarat Chandra Bose]] of the [[Indian National Congress]], Kiran Shankar Roy (Leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party in the Bengal Assembly), and Satya Ranjan Bakshi.<ref>http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=United_Independent_Bengal_Movement</ref> Prominent [[Bengali Muslims]] in support of Suhrawardy included Bengal Finance Minister Mohammad Ali Chaudhury, Bengal Revenue Minister Fazlur Rahman, Tippera politician Ashrafuddin Chowdhury, and [[Abul Hashim]] (Secretary of the [[Bengal Provincial Muslim League]]).<ref>http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=United_Independent_Bengal_Movement</ref> For a while, the proposal was subject to significant negotiations. \n[[File:\u09b6\u09b0\u09ce\u099a\u09a8\u09cd\u09a6\u09cd\u09b0 \u09ac\u09b8\u09c1' \u09b0 \u09ae\u09c2\u09b0\u09cd\u09a4\u09bf.jpg|thumb|Statue of Sarat Chandra Bose in Calcutta.

[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], leader of the Muslim League, was also open to the idea of an independent Bengal. The [[Governor of Bengal]] Sir [[Frederick Burrows]] was also a staunch opponent of partition and supported the scheme.<ref>''The Transfer of Power in India'' By [[V.P.

The plan was based on a confessionalist structure with power-sharing between Hindus and Muslims. It mirrored some of the confessionalist practices adopted in [[Greater Lebanon|French Lebanon]] in 1926, where the positions of President and Prime Minister rotated among Muslims and Christians. \n\nHowever, the Congress Party backtracked in its openness to the idea. On 27 May 1947, Congress leader [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] formally stated that his party would \"agree to Bengal remaining united only if it remains in the [[India]]n Union\".<ref>https://scroll.in/article/907754/why-did-british-prime-minister-attlee-think-bengal-was-going-to-be-an-independent-country-in-1947</ref> Congress President [[J.

In reply to the plea made by Ashrafuddin Chowdhury, Kripalani stated \"All that the Congress seeks to do today is to rescue as many areas as possible from the threatened domination of the League and Pakistan. It wants to save as much territory for a Free Indian Union as is possible under the circumstances.

British commercial interests in Bengal required safeguards. The [[United States government]] was also briefed on the possibility of three countries emerging out of partition, including Pakistan, India, and Bengal. On 2 June 1947, [[British Prime Minister]] [[Clement Attlee]] informed the [[US Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] [[Lewis Williams Douglas]] that there was a \"distinct possibility Bengal might decide against partition and against joining either Hindustan or Pakistan\".<ref>https://www.dawn.com/news/1453994/uk-pm-attlee-believed-bengal-may-opt-to-be-a-separate-country</ref> Douglas cabled the [[US State Department]] about the meeting.<ref>https://www.dawn.com/news/1453994/uk-pm-attlee-believed-bengal-may-opt-to-be-a-separate-country</ref>\n\nOn 3 June 1947, [[Viceroy of India]] [[Earl Mountbatten]] outlined the framework principles of partition, including that in principle the partition of British India was accepted by the British Government; successor governments would be given [[dominion]] status; autonomy and sovereignty will be given to the new countries; each country will make its own constitution; [[princely states]] were given the right to either join Pakistan or India; and that [[British India|Provinces]] can become a separate nation other than Pakistan or India. There appeared to be some popular momentum towards the concept of United Bengal. On 6 June 1947, the [[Sylhet referendum]] was held. Voters in the Sylhet division in Assam Province voted by a majority to bifurcate Sylhet from Assam and merge into Bengal. \n\nOn 20 June 1947, the [[Bengal Legislative Assembly]] met to vote on the partition of Bengal. At the preliminary joint session, the assembly decided by 120 votes to 90 that it should remain united if it joined the [[Constituent Assembly of Pakistan]]. Later, a separate meeting of legislators from West Bengal decided by 58 votes to 21 that the province should be partitioned and that West Bengal should join the [[Constituent Assembly of India]]. In another separate meeting of legislators from East Bengal, it was decided by 106 votes to 35 that the province should not be partitioned and 107 votes to 34 that East Bengal should join Pakistan in the event of partition.<ref>Mukherjee, Soumyendra Nath (1987).

However, since the Partition of Bengal in 1947, the region's politics have veered away from any semblance of pan-Bengali nationalism. It also became complicated with [[India]]n support for [[East Pakistan]]'s liberation as [[Bangladesh]] in 1971. Given the close [[Bangladesh-India relations]], any notion of a pan-Bengali state is considered unrealistic. The pioneer of the United Bengal proposal, Suhrawardy, went on to become a leading statesman of [[Pakistan]]. Suhrawardy died in [[Beirut]] in 1963 in a country with a confessionalist system.  In his memoirs, [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], the founder of Bangladesh and a protege of Suhrawardy, remarked \"The Bengalis has initially failed to appreciate a leader of Mr. Suhrawardy\u2019s stature.

He was an integral part of the team that won back-to-back promotions to the (old) Second Division in the late 1980s (also lifting the [[Football League Trophy|Associate Members' Cup]]). He remained a vital player in the team as they twice failed in the play-offs, as they tried to break into the [[Premier League]] during the 1990s. He eventually left the club in 1997 to join [[Tranmere Rovers]], after making a total of 451 appearances for the Midlanders.\n\nHe played three seasons in the second flight at [[Prenton Park]], helping the club to the [[2000 Football League Cup Final|League Cup final]] in 2000 (although he was an unused substitute at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]]) before leaving on a free transfer to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. His time in Wales was injury-ravaged, as he tore his stomach muscles in only his second game, and damaged his ankle ligaments in his comeback game.\n\nThese setbacks and the arrival of [[Alan Cork]] as manager, saw Thompson being loaned out to League Two [[Shrewsbury Town]] in January 2002. He made the move permanent in the close season, but his only full season with the club saw them lose their league state for the first time, during another injury plagued season for the defender. After being released, he moved to non-league [[Hednesford Town]] but managed only one appearance before injury forced him to retire in 2003.\n\nSince retiring from playing, he has completed a sports science degree at [[Wolverhampton University]] and gained a UEFA B coaching licence.
