LD<sub>50</sub> figures are frequently used as a general indicator of a substance's [[acute toxicity]].  A lower LD<sub>50</sub> is indicative of increased toxicity.\n\nThe test was created by J.W. Trevan in 1927.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/ld50.html|title=What is a LD50 and LC50?|work=OSH Answers Fact Sheets|publisher=Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety}}</ref> The term '''semilethal dose''' is occasionally used in the same sense, in particular with translations of foreign language text, but can also refer to a sublethal dose. LD<sub>50</sub> is usually determined by tests on animals such as [[Laboratory mouse|laboratory mice]].

Stating it this way allows the relative toxicity of different substances to be compared, and normalizes for the variation in the size of the animals exposed (although toxicity does not always scale simply with body mass). For substances in the environment, such as poisonous vapors or substances in water that are toxic to fish, the concentration in the environment (per cubic metre or per litre) is used, giving a value of LC<sub>50</sub>. But in this case, the exposure time is important (see below).\n\nThe choice of 50% lethality as a benchmark avoids the potential for ambiguity of making measurements in the extremes and reduces the amount of testing required. However, this also means that LD<sub>50</sub> is not the lethal dose for all subjects; some may be killed by much less, while others survive doses far higher than the LD<sub>50</sub>. Measures such as \"LD<sub>1</sub>\" and \"LD<sub>99</sub>\" (dosage required to kill 1% or 99%, respectively, of the test population) are occasionally used for specific purposes.<ref>{{cite web|editor=Doris V. Sweet|date=July 1997|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-119-a.pdf|title=Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS\u00ae) / Comprehensive Guide to the RTECS\u00ae|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516165953/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-119-a.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-16 |id=DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 97-119}}</ref>\n\nLethal dosage often varies depending on the method of [[Drug administration|administration]]; for instance, many substances are less toxic when administered orally than when [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] administered. For this reason, LD<sub>50</sub> figures are often qualified with the mode of administration, e.g., \"LD<sub>50</sub> i.v.\"\n\nThe related quantities LD<sub>50</sub>/30 or LD<sub>50</sub>/60 are used to refer to a dose that without treatment will be lethal to 50% of the population within (respectively) 30 or 60 days. These measures are used more commonly within [[Radiation Health Physics]], as survival beyond 60 days usually results in recovery.\n\nA comparable measurement is LCt<sub>50</sub>, which relates to lethal dosage from exposure, where C is concentration and t is time. It is often expressed in terms of mg-min/m<sup>3</sup>. ICt<span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><sub>50</sub></span> is the dose that will cause incapacitation rather than death. These measures are commonly used to indicate the comparative efficacy of [[chemical warfare]] agents, and dosages are typically qualified by rates of breathing (e.g., resting = 10&nbsp;l/min) for inhalation, or degree of clothing for skin penetration.  The concept of Ct was first proposed by [[Fritz Haber]] and is sometimes referred to as [[Haber's Law]], which assumes that exposure to 1 minute of 100&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> is equivalent to 10 minutes of 10&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> (1 \u00d7 100 = 100, as does 10 \u00d7 10 = 100).\n\nSome chemicals, such as [[hydrogen cyanide]], are rapidly detoxified by the human body, and do not follow Haber's Law.  So, in these cases, the lethal concentration may be given simply as LC<sub>50</sub> and qualified by a duration of exposure (e.g., 10 minutes). The [[Material Safety Data Sheet]]s for toxic substances frequently use this form of the term even if the substance does follow Haber's Law.\n\nFor disease-causing organisms, there is also a measure known as the median infective dose and dosage. The median infective dose (ID<sub>50</sub>) is the number of organisms received by a person or test animal qualified by the route of administration (e.g., 1,200 org/man per oral). Because of the difficulties in counting actual organisms in a dose, infective doses may be expressed in terms of biological assay, such as the number of LD<sub>50</sub>'s to some test animal. In [[biological warfare]] infective dosage is the number of infective doses per cubic metre of air times the number of minutes of exposure (e.g., ICt<sub>50</sub> is 100 medium doses - min/m<sup>3</sup>).\n\n== Limitation ==\nAs a measure of toxicity, LD<sub>50</sub> is somewhat unreliable and results may vary greatly between testing facilities due to factors such as the genetic characteristics of the sample population, animal species tested, environmental factors and mode of administration.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ernest Hodgson (2004). ''A Textbook of Modern Toxicology''. Wiley-Interscience (3rd ed.).{{page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere can be wide variability between species as well; what is relatively safe for rats may very well be extremely toxic for humans (''[[cf.]]'' [[paracetamol toxicity]]), and vice versa. For example, chocolate, comparatively harmless to humans, is known to be [[Health effects of chocolate#Other animals|toxic to many animals]]. When used to test [[venom]] from venomous creatures, such as [[snake]]s, LD<sub>50</sub> results may be misleading due to the physiological differences between mice, rats, and humans. Many [[venomous snake]]s are specialized predators on mice, and their venom may be adapted specifically to incapacitate mice; and [[mongoose]]s may be exceptionally resistant. While most [[mammal]]s have a very similar physiology, LD<sub>50</sub> results may or may not have equal bearing upon every mammal species, such as humans, etc.\n\n== Examples ==\nNote: Comparing substances (especially drugs) to each other by LD<sub>50</sub> can be misleading in many cases due (in part) to differences in [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|effective dose]] (ED<sub>50</sub>).  Therefore, it is more useful to compare such substances by [[therapeutic index]], which is simply the ratio of LD<sub>50</sub> to ED<sub>50</sub>.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe following examples are listed in reference to LD<sub>50</sub> values, in descending order, and accompanied by LC<sub>50</sub> values, {bracketed}, when appropriate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Stating it this way allows the relative toxicity of different substances to be compared, and normalizes for the variation in the size of the animals exposed (although toxicity does not always scale simply with body mass). For substances in the environment, such as poisonous vapors or substances in water that are toxic to fish, the concentration in the environment (per cubic metre or per litre) is used, giving a value of LC<sub>50</sub>. But in this case, the exposure time is important (see below).\n\nThe choice of 50% lethality as a benchmark avoids the potential for ambiguity of making measurements in the extremes and reduces the amount of testing required. However, this also means that LD<sub>50</sub> is not the lethal dose for all subjects; some may be killed by much less, while others survive doses far higher than the LD<sub>50</sub>. Measures such as \"LD<sub>1</sub>\" and \"LD<sub>99</sub>\" (dosage required to kill 1% or 99%, respectively, of the test population) are occasionally used for specific purposes.<ref>{{cite web|editor=Doris V. Sweet|date=July 1997|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-119-a.pdf|title=Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS\u00ae) / Comprehensive Guide to the RTECS\u00ae|publisher=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516165953/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/97-119-a.pdf|archive-date=2013-05-16 |id=DHHS (NIOSH) Publication No. 97-119}}</ref>\n\nLethal dosage often varies depending on the method of [[Drug administration|administration]]; for instance, many substances are less toxic when administered orally than when [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]] administered. For this reason, LD<sub>50</sub> figures are often qualified with the mode of administration, e.g., \"LD<sub>50</sub> i.v.\"\n\nThe related quantities LD<sub>50</sub>/30 or LD<sub>50</sub>/60 are used to refer to a dose that without treatment will be lethal to 50% of the population within (respectively) 30 or 60 days. These measures are used more commonly within [[Radiation Health Physics]], as survival beyond 60 days usually results in recovery.\n\nA comparable measurement is LCt<sub>50</sub>, which relates to lethal dosage from exposure, where C is concentration and t is time. It is often expressed in terms of mg-min/m<sup>3</sup>. ICt<span style=\"font-size:100%;\"><sub>50</sub></span> is the dose that will cause incapacitation rather than death. These measures are commonly used to indicate the comparative efficacy of [[chemical warfare]] agents, and dosages are typically qualified by rates of breathing (e.g., resting = 10&nbsp;l/min) for inhalation, or degree of clothing for skin penetration.  The concept of Ct was first proposed by [[Fritz Haber]] and is sometimes referred to as [[Haber's Law]], which assumes that exposure to 1 minute of 100&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> is equivalent to 10 minutes of 10&nbsp;mg/m<sup>3</sup> (1 \u00d7 100 = 100, as does 10 \u00d7 10 = 100).\n\nSome chemicals, such as [[hydrogen cyanide]], are rapidly detoxified by the human body, and do not follow Haber's Law.  So, in these cases, the lethal concentration may be given simply as LC<sub>50</sub> and qualified by a duration of exposure (e.g., 10 minutes). The [[Material Safety Data Sheet]]s for toxic substances frequently use this form of the term even if the substance does follow Haber's Law.\n\nFor disease-causing organisms, there is also a measure known as the median infective dose and dosage. The median infective dose (ID<sub>50</sub>) is the number of organisms received by a person or test animal qualified by the route of administration (e.g., 1,200 org/man per oral). Because of the difficulties in counting actual organisms in a dose, infective doses may be expressed in terms of biological assay, such as the number of LD<sub>50</sub>'s to some test animal. In [[biological warfare]] infective dosage is the number of infective doses per cubic metre of air times the number of minutes of exposure (e.g., ICt<sub>50</sub> is 100 medium doses - min/m<sup>3</sup>).\n\n== Limitation ==\nAs a measure of toxicity, LD<sub>50</sub> is somewhat unreliable and results may vary greatly between testing facilities due to factors such as the genetic characteristics of the sample population, animal species tested, environmental factors and mode of administration.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Ernest Hodgson (2004). ''A Textbook of Modern Toxicology''. Wiley-Interscience (3rd ed.).{{page needed|date=January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThere can be wide variability between species as well; what is relatively safe for rats may very well be extremely toxic for humans (''[[cf.]]'' [[paracetamol toxicity]]), and vice versa. For example, chocolate, comparatively harmless to humans, is known to be [[Health effects of chocolate#Other animals|toxic to many animals]]. When used to test [[venom]] from venomous creatures, such as [[snake]]s, LD<sub>50</sub> results may be misleading due to the physiological differences between mice, rats, and humans. Many [[venomous snake]]s are specialized predators on mice, and their venom may be adapted specifically to incapacitate mice; and [[mongoose]]s may be exceptionally resistant. While most [[mammal]]s have a very similar physiology, LD<sub>50</sub> results may or may not have equal bearing upon every mammal species, such as humans, etc.\n\n== Examples ==\nNote: Comparing substances (especially drugs) to each other by LD<sub>50</sub> can be misleading in many cases due (in part) to differences in [[Effective dose (pharmacology)|effective dose]] (ED<sub>50</sub>).  Therefore, it is more useful to compare such substances by [[therapeutic index]], which is simply the ratio of LD<sub>50</sub> to ED<sub>50</sub>.{{fact|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe following examples are listed in reference to LD<sub>50</sub> values, in descending order, and accompanied by LC<sub>50</sub> values, {bracketed}, when appropriate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Drummer Ashton Irwin explained: \"As far as [[acoustics|sonic]] inspirations go, we always try to incorporate some of what everyone is actually listening to so it's a more genuine and influenced record that we can speak on.\" The album contains a \"lighter\" sound in comparison to the band's previous work. Rhythm guitarist Luke Hemmings said he felt like the [[Youngblood (5 Seconds of Summer album)|last album]] was \"pretty heavy and dark [...] Whereas this one has that side of it with the lighter side of life and moving forward rather than being stuck in one place\".<ref name=\"Herald & Review\">{{Cite web|url=https://herald-review.com/people/seconds-of-summer-inspired-by-industrial-music-on-new-album/article_1d9b84ed-b3e0-523e-b7c0-6a03c68ae855.html|title=5 Seconds of Summer inspired by industrial music on new album CALM|work=[[Herald & Review]]|date=23 March 2020|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref> The band's bassist Calum Hood said most of the credit is owed to vocalist Luke Hemmings, whose lyrics, Hood said, \"tell the tale of a man who has matured over the years and who has really honed in on his craft\". Hood, however, noted:\u00a0\"I think everyone had something to say with this album, in terms of their coming of age - in really reflecting on the people who we were and how things shaped us, and who we want to become in the future.\" He futher described the album as \"pretty chaotic at times\".<ref name=\"ABC\">{{Cite web|url=http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2020/3/30/with-new-album-c-a-l-m-5-seconds-of-summer-says-they-werent.html|title=With new album 'C A L M,' 5 Seconds of Summer says they \"weren't afraid of pushing the\u00a0boundaries\"|website=[[ABC News Radio]]|last=Dresdale|first=Andrea|date=30 March 2020|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and composition==\nAmelia Parreira of ''Riff'' magazine summarized the album, saying 5 Seconds of Summer bring forth\u00a0a \"new musical density and electrifying nuance on\u00a0''Calm'', with a misleading name for a body of work that is anything but sonically mellow\". \nThe album's opening track, the \"groovy, anthemic\" \"Red Desert\" hinges on psychedelia, with the \"gospel-like vocals\" of Luke Hemmings. The song contains light bass vibration from bassist Calum Hood. The song's theme is about \"contentment and falling in love\", which Parreira noted sets the album's tone. Track 2, \"No Shame\" features a \"retro [[1980s in music|'80s pop]] vibe\", layered with \"explosive instrumentals over meaningful lyrics and raw stories\". Hemmings delivers high notes on the song. \"Old Me\", lyrically reflects on past mistakes, and is a high-energy \"dance anthem\". [[Easier (5 Seconds of Summer song)|\"Easier\"]], released as the album's lead single, has a conversational tone, with \"mellow\" electro instrumentation. Second single [[Teeth (5 Seconds of Summer song)|\"Teeth\"]], is a [[grunge|grungy]], rock-tinged song, with an energetic, catchy chorus. Wildflower\", similarly to \"No Shame\", is reminiscent of '80s pop, consisting of a \"[[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]]-like vocal chant before a rise in bass and [[synth-pop|synth]] undertones set a romantic tone on the verses\". \"Best Years\" move at a slower pace, albeit containing a \"danceable vibe\". The piano-led \"Lover of Mine\" features intertwining guitar strumming patterns and \"powerful vocal styles\". \"Thin White Lies\" is an \"angst-ridden\" dance-esque track, with \"strong electric beats\". The album concludes with the slow-burner \"Lonely Heart\" and the self-reflcetive \"High\", both ballads, with slightly energetic production, marking a \"calm end\" to the album.\n\nSources:<ref name=\"Riff Mag\">{{Cite web|url=https://riffmagazine.com/album-reviews/5-seconds-of-summer-5sos-calm/|title=Album review: 5 Seconds of Summer bring high energy to 'CALM'|work=Riff magazine|last=Parreria|first=Amelia|date=27 March 2020|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Gigwise\" />\n\n==Singles==\nThe album's lead single, \"[[Easier (5 Seconds of Summer song)|Easier]]\", was released via [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] on 23 May 2019.

Drummer Ashton Irwin explained: \"As far as [[acoustics|sonic]] inspirations go, we always try to incorporate some of what everyone is actually listening to so it's a more genuine and influenced record that we can speak on.\" The album contains a \"lighter\" sound in comparison to the band's previous work. Rhythm guitarist Luke Hemmings said he felt like the [[Youngblood (5 Seconds of Summer album)|last album]] was \"pretty heavy and dark [...] Whereas this one has that side of it with the lighter side of life and moving forward rather than being stuck in one place\".<ref name=\"Herald & Review\">{{Cite web|url=https://herald-review.com/people/seconds-of-summer-inspired-by-industrial-music-on-new-album/article_1d9b84ed-b3e0-523e-b7c0-6a03c68ae855.html|title=5 Seconds of Summer inspired by industrial music on new album CALM|work=[[Herald & Review]]|date=23 March 2020|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref> The band's bassist Calum Hood said most of the credit is owed to vocalist Luke Hemmings, whose lyrics, Hood said, \"tell the tale of a man who has matured over the years and who has really honed in on his craft\". Hood, however, noted:\u00a0\"I think everyone had something to say with this album, in terms of their coming of age - in really reflecting on the people who we were and how things shaped us, and who we want to become in the future.\" He futher described the album as \"pretty chaotic at times\".<ref name=\"ABC\">{{Cite web|url=http://abcnewsradioonline.com/music-news/2020/3/30/with-new-album-c-a-l-m-5-seconds-of-summer-says-they-werent.html|title=With new album 'C A L M,' 5 Seconds of Summer says they \"weren't afraid of pushing the\u00a0boundaries\"|website=[[ABC News Radio]]|last=Dresdale|first=Andrea|date=30 March 2020|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Music and composition==\nAmelia Parreira of ''Riff'' magazine summarized the album, saying 5 Seconds of Summer bring forth\u00a0a \"new musical density and electrifying nuance on\u00a0''Calm'', with a misleading name for a body of work that is anything but sonically mellow\". \nThe album's opening track, the \"groovy, anthemic\" \"Red Desert\" hinges on psychedelia, with the \"gospel-like vocals\" of Luke Hemmings. The song contains light bass vibration from bassist Calum Hood. The song's theme is about \"contentment and falling in love\", which Parreira noted sets the album's tone. Track 2, \"No Shame\" features a \"retro [[1980s in music|'80s pop]] vibe\", layered with \"explosive instrumentals over meaningful lyrics and raw stories\". Hemmings delivers high notes on the song. \"Old Me\", lyrically reflects on past mistakes, and is a high-energy \"dance anthem\". [[Easier (5 Seconds of Summer song)|\"Easier\"]], released as the album's lead single, has a conversational tone, with \"mellow\" electro instrumentation. Second single [[Teeth (5 Seconds of Summer song)|\"Teeth\"]], is a [[grunge|grungy]], rock-tinged song, with an energetic, catchy chorus. Wildflower\", similarly to \"No Shame\", is reminiscent of '80s pop, consisting of a \"[[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]]-like vocal chant before a rise in bass and [[synth-pop|synth]] undertones set a romantic tone on the verses\". \"Best Years\" move at a slower pace, albeit containing a \"danceable vibe\". The piano-led \"Lover of Mine\" features intertwining guitar strumming patterns and \"powerful vocal styles\". \"Thin White Lies\" is an \"angst-ridden\" dance-esque track, with \"strong electric beats\". The album concludes with the slow-burner \"Lonely Heart\" and the self-reflcetive \"High\", both ballads, with slightly energetic production, marking a \"calm end\" to the album.\n\nSources:<ref name=\"Riff Mag\">{{Cite web|url=https://riffmagazine.com/album-reviews/5-seconds-of-summer-5sos-calm/|title=Album review: 5 Seconds of Summer bring high energy to 'CALM'|work=Riff magazine|last=Parreria|first=Amelia|date=27 March 2020|accessdate=31 March 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"Gigwise\" />\n\n==Singles==\nThe album's lead single, \"[[Easier (5 Seconds of Summer song)|Easier]]\", was released via [[Interscope Records|Interscope]] on 23 May 2019.

In 2017, Lenovo acquired [[Fujitsu]]'s personal computer business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/11995/lenovo-to-acquire-controlling-stake-of-fujitsus-pc-business|title=Lenovo to Acquire Controlling Stake of Fujitsu's PC Business|first=Anton|last=Shilov|website=www.anandtech.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fujitsu-strategy-idUSKBN18X13P|title=Fujitsu to reach agreement \"soon\" on integrating PC business with Lenovo|date=6 June 2017|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref>\n\nLenovo is listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index]], often referred to as \"[[Red Chip]]s\".\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early Years===\n[[Liu Chuanzhi]] along with a group of ten [[engineer]]s (all in their middle age) founded Lenovo on 1 November 1984 in Beijing with 200,000 yuan. The Chinese government approved Lenovo's incorporation on the same day. Ji\u01ce X\u00f9f\u00fa (\u8d3e\u7eed\u798f), one of the founders of Lenovo, indicates the first meeting in preparation for starting the company was held on 17 October of the same year. Eleven people, the entirety of the initial staff, attended. Each of the founders was a member of the Institute of Computing Technology attached to the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. The 200,000 yuan used as start-up capital was approved by Z\u0113ng M\u00e0och\u00e1o (\u66fe\u8302\u671d). The name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company.<ref name=book1/>\n\nTheir first significant effort, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon started developing a circuit board that would allow IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters. This product was Lenovo's first major success. Lenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" The fact that its staff had little business experience compounded Lenovo's early difficulties. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market\", Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting\u2014but also very dangerous\", said Liu. In 1990, Lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name.<ref name=\"chief\">{{cite news |title=China's High-Tech Hero |author=Dickie, Mure |newspaper=Chief Executive |date=1 January 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1988, Lenovo placed its first recruitment advertisement. The ad was placed on the front page of the ''China Youth News''. Such ads were quite rare in China then. Out of the 500 respondents, 280 were selected to take a written employment exam. 120 of these candidates were interviewed in person. Although interviewers initially only had authority to hire 16 people, 58 were given offers. The new staff included 18 people with graduate degrees, 37 with undergraduate degrees, and three students with no university-level education. Their average age was 26. [[Yang Yuanqing]], the current CEO of Lenovo, was among that group.<ref name=book1/>\n\nLiu Chuanzhi received government permission to form a subsidiary in Hong Kong and to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong, furthered his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. To save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. To keep up appearances, they rented hotel rooms for meetings.<ref name=book1/>\n\n===IPO, second offerings, and bond sales===\nLenovo became publicly traded after a 1994 Hong Kong listing that raised nearly US$30 million. Prior to its IPO, many analysts were optimistic about Lenovo. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital.<ref name=book1/>\n\nWhen Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock, he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"<ref name=book1/>\n\nTo fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about US$212 million.<ref name=book1/>\n\n[[Mary Ma]], Lenovo's chief financial officer from 1990 to 2007, was in charge of investor relations. Under her leadership, Lenovo successfully integrated Western-style accountability into its corporate culture. Lenovo's emphasis on transparency earned it a reputation for the best corporate governance among mainland Chinese firms. All major issues regarding its board, management, major share transfers, and mergers and acquisitions were fairly and accurately reported. While Hong Kong-listed firms were only required to issue financial reports twice per year, Lenovo followed the international norm of issuing quarterly reports. Lenovo created an audit committee and a compensation committee with non-management directors. The company started roadshows twice per year to meet institutional investors. Ma organized the first-ever investor relations conference held in Mainland China. The conference was held in Beijing in 2002 and televised on CCTV. Liu and Ma co-hosted the conference and both gave speeches on corporate governance.<ref name=book1/>\n\n[[File:Lenovo logo (English).svg|thumb|Former Lenovo logo, used from 2003 until 2015]]\nIn May 2015, Lenovo revealed a new logo at Lenovo Tech World in Beijing, with the slogan \"Innovation Never Stands Still\" ({{zh|c=\u521b\u65b0\u65e0\u6b62\u5883}}). Lenovo's new logo, created by Saatchi, New York, can be changed by its advertising agencies and sales partners, within restrictions, to fit the context. It has a lounging \"e\" and is surrounded by a box that can be changed to use a relevant scene, solid color, or photograph. Lenovo's Chief Marketing Officer David Roman said, \"When we first started looking at it, it wasn't about just a change in typography or the look of the logo. We asked 'If we really are a net-driven, customer-centric company, what should the logo look like?' We came up with the idea of a digital logo first \u2026 designed to be used on the internet and adaptable to context.\"<ref name=\"AALogo\">{{cite news |last=Snyder Bulik |first=Beth |date=28 May 2015 |title=Worldwide PC Leader Lenovo Rebrands For Post-PC World\n|url=http://adage.com/article/digital/lenovo-rebrands-logo-renewed-post-pc-push/298773/ |newspaper=Advertising Age |location=United States |access-date=8 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn early June 2015, Lenovo announced plans to sell up to US$650 million in five-year bonds denominated in Chinese yuan. The bonds will be sold in Hong Kong with coupon ranging from 4.95% to 5.05%. This is only the second sale of bonds in Lenovo's history.

It had a pastel-colored, shell-shaped case and a seven-port USB hub under its screen. As of 2000, the Tianxi was the best-selling computer in Chinese history. It sold more than 1,000,000 units in 2000 alone.<ref name=\"Tianxi\">{{cite news |last=Sima |first=Katherine |date=19 December 2005 |title=Lenovo's design strategy drives success |url=http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20051219/NEWS/312199974/lenovo-s-design-strategy-drives-success |newspaper=Plastics News |location=United States |access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships===\nLenovo works to integrate the management of each newly acquired company into its larger culture.

Lenovo Chief Technology Officer George He said that vertical integration is having an important role in product development. He stated, \"If you look at the industry trends, most innovations for\" PCs, smartphones, tablets and smart TVs are related to innovation of key components\u2014display, battery and storage.

Lenovo responded by reducing the number of KPIs from 150 to 5, offering intensive training to managers, and working to create a global Lenovo culture. Lenovo also doubled-down on vertical integration and manufacturing near target markets in order to cut costs at time when its competitors were making increased use of outsourcing off-shoring.

Some people have said we are a state-owned enterprise. It's 100% not true. In 1984 the Chinese Academy of Sciences only invested $25,000 in our company. The purpose of the Chinese Academy of Sciences to invest in this company was that they wanted to commercialize their research results. The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a pure research entity in China, owned by the government. From this point, you could say we're different from state-owned enterprises. Secondly, after this investment, this company is run totally by the founders and management team. The government has never been involved in our daily operation, in important decisions, strategic direction, nomination of the CEO and top executives and financial management. Everything is done by our management team.\"<ref name=\"state\">{{cite news |title=Q&A; Chinese Computer Giant Showcases Capitalist Credentials; Chairman of Lenovo, which acquired IBM's PC unit, says the firm has few government ties |author= |url= |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=4 May 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2006, the U.S. State Department was harshly criticized for purchasing 16,000 computers from Lenovo. Critics argued that Lenovo was controlled by the Chinese government and a potential vehicle for espionage against the United States. Yang spoke out forcefully and publicly to defend Lenovo. He said, \"We are not a government-controlled company.\" He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China's transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four state-owned enterprises that dominated the Chinese computer market. Those firms had the full backing of the state while Lenovo received no special treatment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2006-04-19/lenovos-foreign-affairs|title=Lenovo's Foreign Affairs|first=Steve|last=Hamm|date=20 April 2006|url-access=subscription }}</ref> The State Department deal went through. Yang worried that fears about Lenovo's supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an ongoing issue in the United States. Yang worked to ease worries by communicating directly with Congress.\n\nYang dramatically increased his ownership stake by acquiring 797 million shares in 2011. As of June 2011, Yang owned an 8 percent stake in Lenovo. He previously owned only 70 million shares. In a statement, Yang said, \"While the transaction is a personal financial matter, I want to be very clear that my decision to make this investment is based on my strong belief in the company's very bright future. Our culture is built on commitment and ownership&nbsp;\u2013 we do what we say, and we own what we do.

While Lenovo was founded using seed capital from the state-owned [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]], Lenovo is run as a private enterprise with little or no interference by the state. Lenovo's senior executives, including many non-Chinese, rotate between two head offices, one in Beijing and the other in Morrisville, North Carolina, and Lenovo's research and development center in Japan. Two foreigners have previously served as Lenovo's CEO.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\nEnglish is Lenovo's official language. Lenovo's CEO, Yang Yuanqing, initially did not understand English well, but relocated his family to Morrisville to improve his language skills and learn American ways. One American Lenovo executive interviewed by ''The Economist'' praised Yang for his efforts to make Lenovo a friendly place for foreigners to work. He said that Yang had created a \"performance culture\" in place of the traditional Chinese work style of \"waiting to see what the emperor wants\".<ref name=Econ1/>\n\n===Leadership===\n\n====Yang Yuanqing====\n[[File:Yang Yuanqing.jpeg|thumb|Yang Yuanqing, Lenovo's Chairman and CEO]]\n{{Main|Yang Yuanqing}}\nYang Yuanqing is the chairman and chief executive officer of Lenovo. One of his major achievements was leading Lenovo to become the best-selling personal computer brand in China since 1997. In 2001, ''[[Business Week]]'' named him one of Asia's rising stars in business.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/380f96ea-f3f0-11dd-9c4b-0000779fd2ac.html |title=Lenovo chief replaced in reshuffle |date=6 February 2009 |work=[[Financial Times]]|first=Kathrin|last=Hille|accessdate=8 February 2009}}</ref> Yang was president and CEO of Lenovo until 2004, when Lenovo closed its acquisition of IBM's PC division, after which Yang was succeeded as Lenovo CEO by IBM's [[Steve Ward (businessman)|Stephen M. Ward, Jr.]] Ward was succeeded by [[Bill Amelio]] on 20 December 2005. In February 2009, Yang replaced Amelio as CEO and has served in that capacity ever since. Yang was chairman of Lenovo's board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO.\n\nIn 2012, Yang received a $3 million bonus as a reward for record profits, which he in turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo's employees. According to Lenovo spokesman, Jeffrey Shafer, Yang felt that it would be the right thing to, \"redirect [the money] to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done.\" Shafer also said that Yang, who owns about eight percent of Lenovo's stock, \"felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company.\"<ref name=\"Bonus\">{{cite news |title=CEO of Lenovo Gives $3 Million in Bonuses to Employees |first=Lyneka |last=Little |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/07/ceo-of-lenovo-gives-3-million-in-bonuses-to-employees/ |newspaper=ABC News |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of 2,000 yuan or about US$314.

Liu was trained as an engineer at a military college and later went on to work at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. Like many young people during the Cultural Revolution, Liu was denounced and sent to the countryside where he worked as a laborer on a rice farm. Liu claims [[Hewlett-Packard]] as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with ''[[The Economist]]'' he stated that \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{cite news |title=Face value: Legend in the making |author= |url=http://www.economist.com/node/780748 |newspaper=The Economist |date=15 September 2001 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref> In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"<ref name=\"chief\"/>\n\n====Board of directors====\nIn early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo founder [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] to its board. Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Jerry's appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo's reputation as a transparent international company.\" Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm [[ARM Holdings|ARM]], was also appointed to Lenovo's board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, \"We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era.\"\n\n==Marketing and sponsorships==\n\n===Emerging markets===\nIn 2009, Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to divide countries into emerging markets and mature markets. Lenovo then developed a different set of strategies for each category. Lenovo's competitors have widely adopted the same approach<ref name=\"People\"/>\n\nIn 2012, Lenovo made a major effort to expand its market share in developing economies such as Brazil and India through acquisitions and increased budgets for marketing and advertising. While Lenovo has not revealed its total spending on marketing, it did increase marketing and advertising expenditures by $248 million in the fiscal year ending in 2012.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\n====China====\n[[File:A Lenovo Store in China.jpg|thumb|upright|A Lenovo Store in China]]\nIn China, Lenovo has a vast distribution network designed to make sure that there is at least one shop selling Lenovo computers within 50 kilometers of nearly all consumers. Lenovo has also developed close relationships with its Chinese distributors, who are granted exclusive territories and only carry Lenovo products.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\nAs of July 2013, Lenovo believes that urbanization initiatives being pushed by Premier [[Li Keqiang]] will allow it to sustain sales growth in China for the foreseeable future. Speaking at Lenovo's annual general meeting in Hong Kong in 2013, Yang Yuanqing said: \"I believe urbanisation will help us further increase the overall [domestic] PC market.\" Yang also stressed the opportunity presented by the China's relatively low penetration rate of personal computers. Lenovo previously benefited from the Chinese government's rural subsidies, part of a wider economic stimulus initiative, designed to increase purchases of appliances and electronics. That program, which Lenovo joined in 2004, ended in 2011. Lenovo enjoys consistent price premiums over its traditional competitors in rural markets and a stronger local sales and service presence.<ref name=\"FT2\">{{cite web |last=Hille |first=Kathrin |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/da66ab1e-e9fe-11e2-b2f4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Yk2jG67n |title=Lenovo optimistic about China's economy |publisher=FT.com |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}</ref>\n\n====India====\nLenovo has gained significant market share in India through bulk orders to large companies and government agencies. For example, the government of [[Tamil Nadu]] ordered a million laptops from Lenovo in 2012 and single-handedly made the firm a market leader. Lenovo distributes most of the personal computers it sells in India through five national distributors such as [[Ingram Micro]] and Redington.<ref name=\"India6\"/>\n\nGiven that most smartphones and tablets are sold to individuals Lenovo is pursuing a different strategy making use of many small state-centric distributors. Amar Babu, Lenovo's managing director for India, said, \"To reach out to small towns and the hinterland, we have tied up with 40 regional distributors. We want our distributors to be exclusive to us. We will, in turn, ensure they have exclusive rights to distribute Lenovo products in their catchment area.\"<ref name=\"India6\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-03-26/news/38040354_1_million-smartphones-lenovo-india-amar-babu |work=The Times Of India |title=Can Lenovo protect its leadership in PCs & gain share in mobile, tablet businesses in India? |date=26 March 2013}}</ref> As of 2013, Lenovo had about 6,000 retailers selling smartphones and tablets in India. In February 2013, Lenovo established a relationship with Reliance Communications to sell smartphones. The smartphones carried by Reliance have dual-SIM capability and support both GSM and CDMA. Babu claims that the relative under penetration of smartphones in India represents an opportunity for Lenovo.<ref name=\"India6\"/>\n\nLenovo has assembled a team of senior managers familiar with the Indian market, launched mobile phones at all price points there, and worked on branding to build market share. As of February 2014, Lenovo claims that its sales of smartphones in India have been increasing 100% per quarter while the market is only growing 15-20% over the same period. Lenovo did marketing tests of its smartphones in November 2012 in [[Gujarat]] and some southern cities, where Lenovo already had a strong presence. Lenovo's strategy has been to create awareness, maintain a broad selection of phones at all price points, and develop distribution networks. Lenovo partnered with two national distributors and over 100 local distributors. As of February 2014, more than 7,000 retail outlets in India sold Lenovo smartphones. Lenovo has also partnered with HCL in order to set up 250 service centres in 110 cities.<ref name=\"India1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/lenovo-creates-a-big-mobile-buzz/1228658?rheditorpick|title=Lenovo creates a big mobile buzz|first=Sudhir|last=Chowdhary|work=The Financial Express}}</ref>\n\nIn India, Lenovo grants distributors exclusive territories but allows them to sell computers from other companies. Lenovo uses its close relationships with distributors to gain [[market intelligence]] and speed up product development.\n\nLenovo reported a year-on-year increase of about 951% in tablet sales in India for the first quarter of 2014.

West Africa followed when Lenovo set-up a Nigerian legal office and then expanded to Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana.\n\nAccording to Lenovo's general manager for Africa, Graham Braum, Lenovo's strategy is to put \"great emphasis on products that sell well in Africa\" and roll out \"products alongside different African governments' rolling out of wireless technology\". Products such as the Lenovo Yoga series are popular in Africa because of their long battery life, as many areas have unreliable electrical supply.

The campaign was Lenovo's first to go global, except for its domestic market in China, where it retained its existing \"Imagine\" ([[Pinyin]]: ''lian xiang'') slogan. The campaign did not reach China because \"do\" carries connotations of manual labor in the country, an image that Lenovo did not want attached to their brand.<ref name=fc>{{cite news |last=Salter|first=Chuck|title=Protect and Attack: Lenovo's New Strategy|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1793529/protect-and-attack-lenovos-new-strategy|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=Fast Company|date=22 November 2011}}</ref> \"For Those Who Do\" was designed to appeal to young consumers in the 18- to 25-year-old demographic by stressing its utility to creative individuals that Lenovo's advertising refers to as \"doers\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Vega|first=Tanzina|title=Lenovo Aims a Campaign at the Apple Crowd|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/business/media/29adco.html?_r=0|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=28 April 2011}}</ref> One of Lenovo's operational centers is located in North Carolina, United States.

Lenovo said that this sponsorship would boost its efforts to market to the key 18- to 35-year-old male demographic.\n\nThe NFL has been a Lenovo customer since 2007 and the sponsorship resulted from that relationship.

Lenovo worked with three agencies on Goodweird: London-based DLKW Low, We Are Social, and Blast Radius. Goodweird is part of Lenovo's wider strategy to appeal to millennials with an emphasis on design trendsetters. A portion of the funding for Goodweird is being directed to prominent [[YouTubers]] and Viners.

This process occurs even on clean installations of Windows. It was found that this program had been automatically installed using a new feature in [[Windows 8]], [[Features new to Windows 8#Windows Platform Binary Table|Windows Platform Binary Table]], which allows executable files to be stored within UEFI firmware for execution on startup, and is meant to \"allow critical software to persist even when the operating system has changed or been reinstalled in a 'clean' configuration\"; specifically, anti-theft security software. The software was discontinued after it was found that aspects of the software had security vulnerabilities, and did not comply with revised guidelines for appropriate usage of WPBT.

This was discovered by Computerworld writer Michael Horowitz, who had purchased several Think systems with the Customer Feedback program installed, which seemed to log usage data and metrics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2984889/windows-pcs/lenovo-collects-usage-data-on-thinkpad-thinkcentre-and-thinkstation-pcs.html|title=Lenovo collects usage data on ThinkPad, ThinkCentre and ThinkStation PCs|first=Michael|last=Horowitz|date=22 September 2015|work=Computerworld}}</ref> Further analysis by Horowitz revealed however that this was mostly harmless, as it was only logging the usage of some pre-installed Lenovo programs, and not the usage in general, and only if the user allowed the data to be collected. Horowitz also criticized other media for quoting his original article and saying that Lenovo preinstalled spyware, as he himself never used that term in this case and he also said that he does not consider the software he found to be spyware.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2995012/windows-pcs/trusting-lenovo.html|title=Trusting Lenovo|first=Michael|last=Horowitz|date=20 October 2015|work=Computerworld}}</ref>\n\n=== Lenovo Accelerator ===\n\nAs of June 2016, a Duo Labs report stated that Lenovo was still installing bloatware, some of which leads to security vulnerabilities as soon as the user turns on their new PC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/au/news/unbox-your-laptop-security-risks-duo-labs-acer-asus-dell-hp-lenovo/|title=Unbox your laptop, and say hello to security risks|access-date=2016-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://duo.com/assets/pdf/out-of-box-exploitation_oem-updaters.pdf|title=ut-of-Box Exploitation \u2014 A Security Analysis of OEM Updaters|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Lenovo advised users to remove the offending app, \"Lenovo Accelerator\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/lenovo-accelerator-danger|title=Lenovo Urges Windows 10 Users to Uninstall Dangerous Utility|access-date=2016-09-26}}</ref> According to Lenovo, the app, designed to \"speed up the loading\" of Lenovo applications, created a [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] security vulnerability.\n\n=== Foldable Moto Razr video plagiarism ===\nIn 2019 Lenovo was caught passing off enthusiast Waqar Khan's Foldable Moto Razr concept video as its own concept video in a presentation to the technology press. Khan asserted that he had never given Lenovo permission to use his video. While most of the watermarks had been removed the watermark \"Concept by @WaqarKahnHD\" was still visible in some segments of the video.

The company designs, develops, manufactures, and sells [[personal computer]]s, [[tablet computer]]s, [[Lenovo smartphones|smartphones]], [[workstation]]s, [[server (computing)|servers]], [[electronic storage]] devices, IT management software, and [[smart TV|smart televisions]]. Lenovo is the [[market share of personal computer vendors|world's largest personal computer vendor]] by unit sales, as of March 2019. It markets the [[ThinkPad]] and [[ThinkBook]] business lines of notebook computers; [[IdeaPad]], [[Lenovo Yoga|Yoga]], and Legion consumer lines of notebook laptops; and the [[IdeaCentre]] and [[ThinkCentre]] lines of desktops.\n\nLenovo has operations in more than 60 countries and sells its products in around 160 countries. Lenovo's principal facilities are in Beijing and [[Morrisville, North Carolina|Morrisville]] ([[North Carolina]], U.S.), with research centers in Beijing, [[Shanghai]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Xiamen]], [[Chengdu]], [[Nanjing]], [[Wuhan]], [[Yamato, Kanagawa|Yamato]] ([[Kanagawa Prefecture]], Japan), and Morrisville. It also has a joint venture with [[NEC]], Lenovo NEC Holdings, which produces personal computers for the Japanese market.\n\nLenovo was founded in Beijing in November 1984 as '''Legend''' and was incorporated in [[Hong Kong]] in 1988. Lenovo acquired [[IBM]]'s personal computer business in 2005 and agreed to acquire its Intel-based server business in 2014. Lenovo entered the smartphone market in 2012 and as of 2014 was the largest vendor of smartphones in Mainland China. In 2014, Lenovo acquired the mobile phone handset maker [[Motorola Mobility]] from [[Google]]. In 2017, Lenovo acquired [[Fujitsu]]'s personal computer business.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anandtech.com/show/11995/lenovo-to-acquire-controlling-stake-of-fujitsus-pc-business|title=Lenovo to Acquire Controlling Stake of Fujitsu's PC Business|first=Anton|last=Shilov|website=www.anandtech.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-fujitsu-strategy-idUSKBN18X13P|title=Fujitsu to reach agreement \"soon\" on integrating PC business with Lenovo|date=6 June 2017|via=www.reuters.com}}</ref>\n\nLenovo is listed on the [[Hong Kong Stock Exchange]] and is a constituent of the [[Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index]], often referred to as \"[[Red Chip]]s\".\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early Years===\n[[Liu Chuanzhi]] along with a group of ten [[engineer]]s (all in their middle age) founded Lenovo on 1 November 1984 in Beijing with 200,000 yuan. The Chinese government approved Lenovo's incorporation on the same day. Ji\u01ce X\u00f9f\u00fa (\u8d3e\u7eed\u798f), one of the founders of Lenovo, indicates the first meeting in preparation for starting the company was held on 17 October of the same year. Eleven people, the entirety of the initial staff, attended. Each of the founders was a member of the Institute of Computing Technology attached to the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. The 200,000 yuan used as start-up capital was approved by Z\u0113ng M\u00e0och\u00e1o (\u66fe\u8302\u671d). The name for the company agreed upon at this meeting was the Chinese Academy of Sciences Computer Technology Research Institute New Technology Development Company.<ref name=book1/>\n\nTheir first significant effort, an attempt to import televisions, failed. The group rebuilt itself within a year by conducting quality checks on computers for new buyers. Lenovo soon started developing a circuit board that would allow IBM-compatible personal computers to process Chinese characters. This product was Lenovo's first major success. Lenovo also tried and failed to market a digital watch. Liu said, \"Our management team often differed on which commercial road to travel. This led to big discussions, especially between the engineering chief and myself. He felt that if the quality of the product was good, then it would sell itself. But I knew this was not true, that marketing and other factors were part of the eventual success of a product.\" The fact that its staff had little business experience compounded Lenovo's early difficulties. \"We were mainly scientists and didn't understand the market\", Liu said. \"We just learned by trial-and-error, which was very interesting\u2014but also very dangerous\", said Liu. In 1990, Lenovo started to manufacture and market computers using its own brand name.<ref name=\"chief\">{{cite news |title=China's High-Tech Hero |author=Dickie, Mure |newspaper=Chief Executive |date=1 January 2005}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1988, Lenovo placed its first recruitment advertisement. The ad was placed on the front page of the ''China Youth News''. Such ads were quite rare in China then. Out of the 500 respondents, 280 were selected to take a written employment exam. 120 of these candidates were interviewed in person. Although interviewers initially only had authority to hire 16 people, 58 were given offers. The new staff included 18 people with graduate degrees, 37 with undergraduate degrees, and three students with no university-level education. Their average age was 26. [[Yang Yuanqing]], the current CEO of Lenovo, was among that group.<ref name=book1/>\n\nLiu Chuanzhi received government permission to form a subsidiary in Hong Kong and to move there along with five other employees. Liu's father, already in Hong Kong, furthered his son's ambitions through mentoring and facilitating loans. Liu moved to Hong Kong in 1988. To save money during this period, Liu and his co-workers walked instead of taking public transportation. To keep up appearances, they rented hotel rooms for meetings.<ref name=book1/>\n\n===IPO, second offerings, and bond sales===\nLenovo became publicly traded after a 1994 Hong Kong listing that raised nearly US$30 million. Prior to its IPO, many analysts were optimistic about Lenovo. The company was praised for its good management, strong brand recognition, and growth potential. Analysts also worried about Lenovo's profitability. Lenovo's IPO was massively over-subscribed. On its first day of trading, the company's stock price hit a high of HK$2.07 and closed at HK$2.00. Proceeds from the offering were used to finance sales offices in Europe, North America and Australia, to expand and improve production and research and development, and to increase working capital.<ref name=book1/>\n\nWhen Lenovo was first listed, its managers thought the only purpose of going public was to raise capital. They had little understanding of the rules and responsibilities that went along with running a public company. Before Lenovo conducted its first secondary offering in 1997, Liu proudly announced the company's intent to mainland newspapers only to have its stock halted for two days by regulators to punish his statement. This occurred several times until Liu learned that he had to choose his words carefully in public. The first time Liu traveled to Europe on a \"roadshow\" to discuss his company's stock, he was shocked by the skeptical questions he was subjected to and felt offended. Liu later came to understand that he was accountable to shareholders. He said, \"Before I only had one boss, but CAS never asked me anything. I relied on my own initiative to do things. We began to think about issues of credibility. Legend began to learn how to become a truly international company.\"<ref name=book1/>\n\nTo fund its continued growth, Lenovo issued a secondary offering of 50 million shares on the Hong Kong market in March 2000 and raised about US$212 million.<ref name=book1/>\n\n[[Mary Ma]], Lenovo's chief financial officer from 1990 to 2007, was in charge of investor relations. Under her leadership, Lenovo successfully integrated Western-style accountability into its corporate culture. Lenovo's emphasis on transparency earned it a reputation for the best corporate governance among mainland Chinese firms. All major issues regarding its board, management, major share transfers, and mergers and acquisitions were fairly and accurately reported. While Hong Kong-listed firms were only required to issue financial reports twice per year, Lenovo followed the international norm of issuing quarterly reports. Lenovo created an audit committee and a compensation committee with non-management directors. The company started roadshows twice per year to meet institutional investors. Ma organized the first-ever investor relations conference held in Mainland China. The conference was held in Beijing in 2002 and televised on CCTV. Liu and Ma co-hosted the conference and both gave speeches on corporate governance.<ref name=book1/>\n\n[[File:Lenovo logo (English).svg|thumb|Former Lenovo logo, used from 2003 until 2015]]\nIn May 2015, Lenovo revealed a new logo at Lenovo Tech World in Beijing, with the slogan \"Innovation Never Stands Still\" ({{zh|c=\u521b\u65b0\u65e0\u6b62\u5883}}). Lenovo's new logo, created by Saatchi, New York, can be changed by its advertising agencies and sales partners, within restrictions, to fit the context. It has a lounging \"e\" and is surrounded by a box that can be changed to use a relevant scene, solid color, or photograph. Lenovo's Chief Marketing Officer David Roman said, \"When we first started looking at it, it wasn't about just a change in typography or the look of the logo. We asked 'If we really are a net-driven, customer-centric company, what should the logo look like?' We came up with the idea of a digital logo first \u2026 designed to be used on the internet and adaptable to context.\"<ref name=\"AALogo\">{{cite news |last=Snyder Bulik |first=Beth |date=28 May 2015 |title=Worldwide PC Leader Lenovo Rebrands For Post-PC World\n|url=http://adage.com/article/digital/lenovo-rebrands-logo-renewed-post-pc-push/298773/ |newspaper=Advertising Age |location=United States |access-date=8 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn early June 2015, Lenovo announced plans to sell up to US$650 million in five-year bonds denominated in Chinese yuan. The bonds will be sold in Hong Kong with coupon ranging from 4.95% to 5.05%. This is only the second sale of bonds in Lenovo's history.

It had a pastel-colored, shell-shaped case and a seven-port USB hub under its screen. As of 2000, the Tianxi was the best-selling computer in Chinese history. It sold more than 1,000,000 units in 2000 alone.<ref name=\"Tianxi\">{{cite news |last=Sima |first=Katherine |date=19 December 2005 |title=Lenovo's design strategy drives success |url=http://www.plasticsnews.com/article/20051219/NEWS/312199974/lenovo-s-design-strategy-drives-success |newspaper=Plastics News |location=United States |access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Mergers, acquisitions, and partnerships===\nLenovo works to integrate the management of each newly acquired company into its larger culture.

Lenovo Chief Technology Officer George He said that vertical integration is having an important role in product development.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences is a pure research entity in China, owned by the government. From this point, you could say we're different from state-owned enterprises.

He said, \"We are not a government-controlled company.\" He pointed out that Lenovo pioneered China's transition to a market economy and that in the early 1990s had fought and beaten four state-owned enterprises that dominated the Chinese computer market.

Yang worried that fears about Lenovo's supposed connections to the Chinese government would be an ongoing issue in the United States.

As of June 2011, Yang owned an 8 percent stake in Lenovo. He previously owned only 70 million shares.

Yang was chairman of Lenovo's board from 2004 to 2008, and returned as chairman in 2012 alongside his role as CEO.\n\nIn 2012, Yang received a $3 million bonus as a reward for record profits, which he in turn redistributed to about 10,000 of Lenovo's employees. According to Lenovo spokesman, Jeffrey Shafer, Yang felt that it would be the right thing to, \"redirect [the money] to the employees as a real tangible gesture for what they done.\" Shafer also said that Yang, who owns about eight percent of Lenovo's stock, \"felt that he was rewarded well simply as the owner of the company.\"<ref name=\"Bonus\">{{cite news |title=CEO of Lenovo Gives $3 Million in Bonuses to Employees |first=Lyneka |last=Little |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/business/2012/07/ceo-of-lenovo-gives-3-million-in-bonuses-to-employees/ |newspaper=ABC News |date=23 July 2012 |accessdate=3 August 2012}}</ref> The bonuses were mostly distributed among staff working in positions such as production and reception who received an average of 2,000 yuan or about US$314.

Liu was trained as an engineer at a military college and later went on to work at the [[Chinese Academy of Sciences]]. Like many young people during the Cultural Revolution, Liu was denounced and sent to the countryside where he worked as a laborer on a rice farm. Liu claims [[Hewlett-Packard]] as a key source of inspiration. In an interview with ''[[The Economist]]'' he stated that \"Our earliest and best teacher was Hewlett-Packard.\" For more than ten years, Lenovo was Hewlett-Packard's distributor in China.<ref name=\"Economist\">{{cite news |title=Face value: Legend in the making |author= |url=http://www.economist.com/node/780748 |newspaper=The Economist |date=15 September 2001 |accessdate=6 February 2013}}</ref> In reference to Lenovo's later acquisition of IBM's personal computer unit Liu said, \"I remember the first time I took part in a meeting of IBM agents. I was wearing an old business suit of my father's and I sat in the back row. Even in my dreams, I never imagined that one day we could buy the IBM PC business. It was unthinkable. Impossible.\"<ref name=\"chief\"/>\n\n====Board of directors====\nIn early 2013, Lenovo announced the addition of Yahoo founder [[Jerry Yang (entrepreneur)|Jerry Yang]] to its board. Lenovo's CEO Yang Yuanqing said, \"Jerry's appointment as an observer to our board furthers Lenovo's reputation as a transparent international company.\" Just prior to the appointment of Jerry Yang, Tudor Brown, the founder of British semiconductor design firm [[ARM Holdings|ARM]], was also appointed to Lenovo's board. Speaking of both men Yang Yuanqing said, \"We believe that they will add a great deal to our strategic thinking, long-term direction and, ultimately, our ability to achieve our aspirations in the PC plus era.\"\n\n==Marketing and sponsorships==\n\n===Emerging markets===\nIn 2009, Lenovo became the first personal computer manufacturer to divide countries into emerging markets and mature markets. Lenovo then developed a different set of strategies for each category. Lenovo's competitors have widely adopted the same approach<ref name=\"People\"/>\n\nIn 2012, Lenovo made a major effort to expand its market share in developing economies such as Brazil and India through acquisitions and increased budgets for marketing and advertising. While Lenovo has not revealed its total spending on marketing, it did increase marketing and advertising expenditures by $248 million in the fiscal year ending in 2012.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\n====China====\n[[File:A Lenovo Store in China.jpg|thumb|upright|A Lenovo Store in China]]\nIn China, Lenovo has a vast distribution network designed to make sure that there is at least one shop selling Lenovo computers within 50 kilometers of nearly all consumers. Lenovo has also developed close relationships with its Chinese distributors, who are granted exclusive territories and only carry Lenovo products.<ref name=Econ1/>\n\nAs of July 2013, Lenovo believes that urbanization initiatives being pushed by Premier [[Li Keqiang]] will allow it to sustain sales growth in China for the foreseeable future. Speaking at Lenovo's annual general meeting in Hong Kong in 2013, Yang Yuanqing said: \"I believe urbanisation will help us further increase the overall [domestic] PC market.\" Yang also stressed the opportunity presented by the China's relatively low penetration rate of personal computers. Lenovo previously benefited from the Chinese government's rural subsidies, part of a wider economic stimulus initiative, designed to increase purchases of appliances and electronics. That program, which Lenovo joined in 2004, ended in 2011. Lenovo enjoys consistent price premiums over its traditional competitors in rural markets and a stronger local sales and service presence.<ref name=\"FT2\">{{cite web |last=Hille |first=Kathrin |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/da66ab1e-e9fe-11e2-b2f4-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2Yk2jG67n |title=Lenovo optimistic about China's economy |publisher=FT.com |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}</ref>\n\n====India====\nLenovo has gained significant market share in India through bulk orders to large companies and government agencies. For example, the government of [[Tamil Nadu]] ordered a million laptops from Lenovo in 2012 and single-handedly made the firm a market leader. Lenovo distributes most of the personal computers it sells in India through five national distributors such as [[Ingram Micro]] and Redington.<ref name=\"India6\"/>\n\nGiven that most smartphones and tablets are sold to individuals Lenovo is pursuing a different strategy making use of many small state-centric distributors. Amar Babu, Lenovo's managing director for India, said, \"To reach out to small towns and the hinterland, we have tied up with 40 regional distributors. We want our distributors to be exclusive to us. We will, in turn, ensure they have exclusive rights to distribute Lenovo products in their catchment area.\"<ref name=\"India6\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-03-26/news/38040354_1_million-smartphones-lenovo-india-amar-babu |work=The Times Of India |title=Can Lenovo protect its leadership in PCs & gain share in mobile, tablet businesses in India? |date=26 March 2013}}</ref> As of 2013, Lenovo had about 6,000 retailers selling smartphones and tablets in India. In February 2013, Lenovo established a relationship with Reliance Communications to sell smartphones. The smartphones carried by Reliance have dual-SIM capability and support both GSM and CDMA. Babu claims that the relative under penetration of smartphones in India represents an opportunity for Lenovo.<ref name=\"India6\"/>\n\nLenovo has assembled a team of senior managers familiar with the Indian market, launched mobile phones at all price points there, and worked on branding to build market share. As of February 2014, Lenovo claims that its sales of smartphones in India have been increasing 100% per quarter while the market is only growing 15-20% over the same period. Lenovo did marketing tests of its smartphones in November 2012 in [[Gujarat]] and some southern cities, where Lenovo already had a strong presence. Lenovo's strategy has been to create awareness, maintain a broad selection of phones at all price points, and develop distribution networks. Lenovo partnered with two national distributors and over 100 local distributors. As of February 2014, more than 7,000 retail outlets in India sold Lenovo smartphones. Lenovo has also partnered with HCL in order to set up 250 service centres in 110 cities.<ref name=\"India1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/lenovo-creates-a-big-mobile-buzz/1228658?rheditorpick|title=Lenovo creates a big mobile buzz|first=Sudhir|last=Chowdhary|work=The Financial Express}}</ref>\n\nIn India, Lenovo grants distributors exclusive territories but allows them to sell computers from other companies. Lenovo uses its close relationships with distributors to gain [[market intelligence]] and speed up product development.\n\nLenovo reported a year-on-year increase of about 951% in tablet sales in India for the first quarter of 2014. Canalys, a market research firm, said Lenovo took market share away from Apple and Samsung in the country.<ref name=\"IndiaGrowth\">{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/item/36827-the-tech-business-week-len|title=The tech business week: Lenovo to double Irish workforce, Duolog opens Texas offices|work=Silicon Republic}}</ref>\n\n====Africa====\nLenovo first started doing business in [[South Africa]], establishing a sales office, and then expanded to East African markets such as Kenya, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Rwanda. West Africa followed when Lenovo set-up a Nigerian legal office and then expanded to Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Botswana.\n\nAccording to Lenovo's general manager for Africa, Graham Braum, Lenovo's strategy is to put \"great emphasis on products that sell well in Africa\" and roll out \"products alongside different African governments' rolling out of wireless technology\". Products such as the Lenovo Yoga series are popular in Africa because of their long battery life, as many areas have unreliable electrical supply. Other popular products include the Lenovo netbooks, which were introduced in 2008.<ref name=dexing>{{cite news |last=Dexing |first=Qin |date=2015-02-13 |title=Lenovo Expands to Africa |url=http://www.ecns.cn/business/2015/02-13/154889.shtml |newspaper=ECNS.com |access-date=2015-03-09}}</ref>\n\nLenovo picked Nigeria in 2013 to release its smartphone because unlike South Africa and other African countries, there is no requirement to partner with a local telecom firm to sell its phones.<ref name=\"Africa1\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-09/lenovo-will-debut-first-africa-smartphone-in-nigeria-by-year-end.html |work=Bloomberg |first=Chris |last=Spillane |title=Lenovo Plans to Debut Africa Smartphone in Nigeria This Year |date=10 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the long term, according to Braum, \"Lenovo in Africa will focus on continuing to consistently supply personal computer products and allow this market to grow, while moving into new territory such as mobile and enterprise.\"<ref name=dexing/>\n\n===United States===\nIn the United States, Lenovo began the \"For Those Who Do\" marketing campaign in 2010, created by the ad agency [[Saatchi & Saatchi]]. The campaign was Lenovo's first to go global, except for its domestic market in China, where it retained its existing \"Imagine\" ([[Pinyin]]: ''lian xiang'') slogan. The campaign did not reach China because \"do\" carries connotations of manual labor in the country, an image that Lenovo did not want attached to their brand.<ref name=fc>{{cite news |last=Salter|first=Chuck|title=Protect and Attack: Lenovo's New Strategy|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1793529/protect-and-attack-lenovos-new-strategy|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=Fast Company|date=22 November 2011}}</ref> \"For Those Who Do\" was designed to appeal to young consumers in the 18- to 25-year-old demographic by stressing its utility to creative individuals that Lenovo's advertising refers to as \"doers\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Vega|first=Tanzina|title=Lenovo Aims a Campaign at the Apple Crowd|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/29/business/media/29adco.html?_r=0|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=28 April 2011}}</ref> One of Lenovo's operational centers is located in North Carolina, United States.

Kutcher announced Lenovo's Yoga Tablet at a media event the same month; he flew to China to meet with Lenovo executives shortly thereafter. David Roman, Lenovo's chief marketing officer, said, \"His partnership goes beyond traditional bounds by deeply integrating him into our organization as a product engineer. Ashton will help us break new ground by challenging assumptions, bringing a new perspective and contributing his technical expertise to Yoga Tablet and other devices.\" Kutcher co-founded [[A-Grade Investments]], an investor in [[Airbnb]], [[Foursquare City Guide|Foursquare]], [[Spotify]], [[Path (social network)|Path]], [[Uber]], and other technology firms.

Lenovo will receive advertising space in NFL venues and events and be allowed to use the NFL logo on its products and ads. Lenovo said that this sponsorship would boost its efforts to market to the key 18- to 35-year-old male demographic.\n\nThe NFL has been a Lenovo customer since 2007 and the sponsorship resulted from that relationship. NFL stars [[Jerry Rice]], [[DeAngelo Williams]], and [[Torry Holt]] were on hand for the announcement and a celebration with 1,500 Lenovo employees.

The film depicted a mysterious young woman using the IdeaPad Yoga 13 to stay one-step-ahead of her evil pursuers. [[Martin Campbell]], who previously worked on action movies and James Bond films such as GoldenEye and the remake of Casino Royale, shot this film. Lenovo was the first Chinese company to make use of such marketing techniques.<ref name=\"Big1\"/>\n\n===Tech World===\nIn May 2015, Lenovo hosted its first ever \"Tech World\" conference in Beijing. The CEOs of [[Intel]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Baidu]] delivered keynote addresses along with Lenovo CEO Yang Yuanqing. Lenovo also used Tech World to announce a refresh of its corporate logo and visual identity. The shift in Lenovo's visual presentation was accompanied by changes in Lenovo's business model.

Goodweird is designed to convey the idea that designs that seem strange initially often become familiar and widely accepted. The Goodweird campaign includes a video with famous images of early attempts to fly with the aid of homemade wings and a bicycle that transitions to a modern-day shot of a man soaring across mountains in a wingsuit before transitioning again to a shot of the [[Stealth Bomber]]. Lenovo worked with three agencies on Goodweird: London-based DLKW Low, We Are Social, and Blast Radius. Goodweird is part of Lenovo's wider strategy to appeal to millennials with an emphasis on design trendsetters. A portion of the funding for Goodweird is being directed to prominent [[YouTubers]] and Viners.

This was discovered by Computerworld writer Michael Horowitz, who had purchased several Think systems with the Customer Feedback program installed, which seemed to log usage data and metrics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2984889/windows-pcs/lenovo-collects-usage-data-on-thinkpad-thinkcentre-and-thinkstation-pcs.html|title=Lenovo collects usage data on ThinkPad, ThinkCentre and ThinkStation PCs|first=Michael|last=Horowitz|date=22 September 2015|work=Computerworld}}</ref> Further analysis by Horowitz revealed however that this was mostly harmless, as it was only logging the usage of some pre-installed Lenovo programs, and not the usage in general, and only if the user allowed the data to be collected. Horowitz also criticized other media for quoting his original article and saying that Lenovo preinstalled spyware, as he himself never used that term in this case and he also said that he does not consider the software he found to be spyware.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/2995012/windows-pcs/trusting-lenovo.html|title=Trusting Lenovo|first=Michael|last=Horowitz|date=20 October 2015|work=Computerworld}}</ref>\n\n=== Lenovo Accelerator ===\n\nAs of June 2016, a Duo Labs report stated that Lenovo was still installing bloatware, some of which leads to security vulnerabilities as soon as the user turns on their new PC.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/au/news/unbox-your-laptop-security-risks-duo-labs-acer-asus-dell-hp-lenovo/|title=Unbox your laptop, and say hello to security risks|access-date=2016-09-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://duo.com/assets/pdf/out-of-box-exploitation_oem-updaters.pdf|title=ut-of-Box Exploitation \u2014 A Security Analysis of OEM Updaters|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> Lenovo advised users to remove the offending app, \"Lenovo Accelerator\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/lenovo-accelerator-danger|title=Lenovo Urges Windows 10 Users to Uninstall Dangerous Utility|access-date=2016-09-26}}</ref> According to Lenovo, the app, designed to \"speed up the loading\" of Lenovo applications, created a [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]] security vulnerability.\n\n=== Foldable Moto Razr video plagiarism ===\nIn 2019 Lenovo was caught passing off enthusiast Waqar Khan's Foldable Moto Razr concept video as its own concept video in a presentation to the technology press.

It is the largest party represented in the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] and coexists ''[[de jure]]'' with two other legal parties making up the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland]]. However, these minor parties are completely subservient to the WPK,{{sfn|Cha|Hwang|2009|p=214}} and must accept the WPK's \"[[vanguard party|leading role]]\" as a condition of their existence.\n\nWPK was founded in 1949 with the merger of the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] and the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]]. The WPK also controls the [[Korean People's Army]]. WPK (and all of the other parties in the DPRK) remains illegal in [[South Korea]] under South Korea's own [[National Security Act (South Korea)|National Security Act]] and is sanctioned by [[Australia]], the [[European Union]], the [[United Nations]] and the [[United States]].<ref>[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/16/executive-order-blocking-property-government-north-korea-and-workers Executive Order -- Blocking Property of the Government of North Korea and the Workers' Party of Korea, and Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to North Korea]</ref>\n\nThe WPK is organized according to the [[Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System|Monolithic Ideological System]] and the [[Great Leader (concept)|Great Leader]], a system and theory conceived by [[Kim Yong-ju]] and [[Kim Jong-il]]. The highest body of the WPK is formally the Congress, but in practice a Congress occurs infrequently. Between 1980 and 2016, there were no congresses held. Although the WPK is organizationally similar to [[Communist party|communist parties]], in practice it is far less institutionalized and informal politics plays a larger role than usual. Institutions such as the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Committee]], the [[Executive Policy Bureau of the Workers' Party of Korea|Executive Policy Bureau]], the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Military Commission]] (CMC), the [[Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Politburo]] and the Politburo's [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Presidium]] have much less power than that formally bestowed on them by [[Charter of the Workers' Party of Korea|the party's charter]], which is little more than a nominal document. [[Kim Jong-un]] is the current WPK leader, serving as [[Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea|Chairman]] and CMC chairman.\n\nThe WPK is committed to ''[[Juche]]'', an ideology which has been described as a combination of [[collectivism]] and [[Korean nationalism|nationalism]]; and at the 4th Conference (held in 2012), the party charter was amended to state that [[Kimilsungism\u2013Kimjongilism]] was \"the only guiding idea of the party\". At the 3rd Conference (held in 2010), the WPK removed a sentence from the preamble which expressed the party's commitment \"to building a [[pure communism|communist society]]\", replacing it with a new adherence to ''[[Songun]]'', the [[Militarism|\"military-first\" policies]] developed by Kim Jong-il. The 2009 revision had already removed all references to communism. Party ideology has recently focused on perceived [[Imperialism|imperialist]] enemies of the party and state; and on legitimizing the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]]'s dominance of the political system. Before the rise of ''Juche'' and later ''Songun'', the party was committed to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist thought]] as well, with its importance becoming greatly diminished over time.\n\nThe party's emblem is an adaptation of the communist [[hammer and sickle]], with a traditional [[Korean calligraphy]] brush. The symbols represent the industrial workers (hammer), peasants (sickle) and intelligentsia (ink brush).\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Workers' Party of Korea}}\n{{Infobox Korean name\n|title      = '''Workers' Party of Korea'''\n|image      = Workers' Party of Korea.svg\n|caption    = \"Workers' Party of Korea\" in [[Hancha]] (top) and [[Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl]] (bottom) scripts\n|context    = north\n|hangul     = {{linktext|\uc870\uc120|\ub85c\ub3d9|\ub2f9}}, {{linktext|\ubd81\ud55c|\ub178\ub3d9|\ub2f9}}\n|hanja      = {{linktext|lang=ko-Hant|\u671d\u9bae|\u52de\u52d5|\u9ee8}}, {{linktext|lang=ko-Hant|\u5317\u97d3|\u52de\u52d5|\u9ee8}}\n|mr         = Chos\u014fn Rodongdang, Bukhan Nodongdang\n|rr         = Joseon Rodongdang, Pukhan Nodongdang\n|tablewidth = 288\n|fontcolor  = #FFFF00\n|color      = {{Workers' Party of Korea/meta/color}}\n}}\n\n===Founding and early years (1945\u20131953)===\nOn 13 October 1945, the {{ill|North Korean Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea|ko|\ubd81\uc870\uc120\uacf5\uc0b0\ub2f9}} (NKB\u2013CPK) was established,{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=20}} with [[Kim Yong-bom]] its first chairman.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=21}} However, the NKB\u2013CPK remained subordinate to the [[Communist Party of Korea|CPK]] Central Committee (headquartered in Seoul and headed by [[Pak Hon-yong]]).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=22}} Two months later, at the 3rd Plenum of the NKB, Kim Yong-bom was replaced by [[Kim Il-sung]] (an event probably orchestrated by the Soviet Union).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=21\u201322}} In spring 1946 the North Korean Bureau became the [[Communist Party of North Korea]], with Kim Il-sung its elected chairman.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=28\u201329}} On 22 July 1946 Soviet authorities in North Korea established the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland|United Democratic National Front]], a [[popular front]] led by the Communist Party of North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=29}} The Communist Party of North Korea soon merged with the [[New People's Party of Korea]], a party primarily composed of communists from China.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=29}} On 28 July 1946 a special commission of the two parties ratified the merger, and it became official the following day.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=31}} One month later (28\u201330 August 1946) the party held its [[1st Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea|founding congress]], establishing the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] (WPNK).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=31}} The congress elected former leader of the New People's Party of Korea [[Kim Tu-bong]] as the first WPNK chairman, with Kim Il-sung its appointed deputy chairman.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=31}} However, despite his formal downgrade in the party's hierarchy Kim Il-sung remained its leader.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n[[File:Kim Il-sung and Pak Hon-yong, Baik Namun in Pyungyang.jpg|thumb|[[Kim Il-sung]] (left) with [[Pak Hon-yong]] in [[Pyongyang]], 1948]]\nParty control increased throughout the country after the congress.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=33\u201340}} From 27\u201330 March 1948, the WPNK convened its [[2nd Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea|2nd Congress]].{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=40}} While Kim Tu-bong was still the party's formal head, Kim Il-sung presented the main report to the congress.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=42}} In it he claimed that North Korea was \"a base of democracy\", in contrast to South Korea (which was, he believed, dictatorial).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=42}} On 28 April 1948 a special session of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] approved the constitution (proposed and written by WPNK cadres), which led to the official establishment of an independent North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=44}} It did not call for the establishment of an independent North Korea, but for a unified (communist) Korea; the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) would be Seoul, not Pyongyang.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=45}} Kim Il-sung was the appointed head of government of the new state, with Kim Tu-bong heading the legislative branch.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=47}} A year later on 30 June 1949, the Workers' Party of Korea was created with the merger of the WPNK and the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/event/nkorea_nuclear/general_03c.htm|title=KBS WORLD Radio|work=kbs.co.kr}}</ref>\n\nKim Il-sung was not the most ardent supporter of a military reunification of Korea; that role was played by the South Korean communists, headed by Pak Hon-yong.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=60}} After several meetings with [[Joseph Stalin]] (the [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|leader of the Soviet Union]]), North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950\u2014and thus began the [[Korean War]].{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=61}} With American intervention in the war the DPRK nearly collapsed, but it was saved by Chinese intervention in the conflict.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=61}} The war had the effect of weakening Soviet influence over Kim Il-sung and the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}} Around this time, the main fault lines in early WPK politics were created. Four factions formed: domestic (a group of WPK cadres who had remained in Korea during Japanese rule), Soviet Koreans (Koreans sent from the Soviet Union), Yanan (Koreans from China) and guerrillas (Kim Il-sung's personal faction).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}} However, Kim would be unable to further strengthen his position until the end of the war.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}}\n\n===Kim Il-sung's consolidation of power (1953\u20131980)===\n[[File:Mosaic Depicting Kim Il Sungs Homecoming, Pyongyang, North Korea (2907648510).jpg|thumb|left|Propaganda mosaic commemorating the triumphant homecoming of Kim Il-sung after he liberated Korea from Japan]]\nRelations worsened between the WPK and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) when Stalin's successor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], began pursuing a policy of [[de-Stalinization]].{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} During the [[Sino\u2013Soviet conflict]], an ideological conflict between the CPSU and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), Kim Il-sung maneuvered between the two socialist superpowers; by doing so, he weakened their influence on the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} By 1962 Kim Il-sung and the WPK favored the CPC over the CPSU in the ideological struggle, and \"for a few years North Korea almost unconditionally supported the Chinese position on all important issues.\"{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} The primary conflict between the WPK and the CPSU during this period was that Kim Il-sung did not support the denunciation of [[Stalinism]] (including Stalin's [[cult of personality]]), the creation of a [[collective leadership]] and the theory of [[peaceful coexistence]] between the capitalist and socialist worlds.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} Kim Il-sung believed peaceful coexistence synonymous with capitulation, and knew that de-Stalinization in North Korea would effectively end his unlimited power over the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} The result of the souring of relations between the CPSU and the WPK was that the Soviet Union discontinued aid to North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} As a result, several industries were on the brink of disaster; China was unwilling to increase aid to North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} [[Mao Zedong]] began the [[Cultural Revolution]] shortly thereafter, an event criticized by the WPK as \"left-wing opportunism\" and a manifestation of the \"[[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] theory of a [[permanent revolution]].\"{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} Relations towards the CPSU and the CPC stabilized during the 1960s, with the WPK making it clear it would remain neutral in the Sino\u2013Soviet conflict,{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} thus resulting in the 1966 launch of the ''Juche'' program aimed at national self-determination at all levels. This, in turn, strengthened Kim Il-Sung's position in the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}}\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, Kim Il-sung's cult of personality reached new heights.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=70}} It had been no greater than Stalin's or Mao's until 1972, when [[Day of the Sun|his birthday]] on April 15 became the country's main [[Public holidays in North Korea|public holiday]] and statues of him began to be built nationwide.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=70}} Kim became known as \"Great Leader\", the \"Sun of the Nation\", \"The Iron All-Victorious General\" and \"Marshal of the All-Mighty Republic\" in WPK and state publications; official propaganda stated that \"burning loyalty to the leader\" was one of the main characteristics of any Korean.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=70}}\n\nKim Il-sung and his guerilla faction had purged the WPK of its opposing factions during the 1950s and the 1960s, to the dismay of both the CPC and the CPSU.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}} The domestic faction was the first to go (in 1953\u201355), followed by the Yan'an faction in 1957\u201358 and the Soviet Koreans (along with anyone else deemed unfaithful to the WPK leadership) in the 1957\u201362 purge.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=62\u201363}} According to historian [[Andrei Lankov]], \"Kim Il-sung had become not only supreme, but also the omnipotent ruler of North Korea\u2014no longer merely 'first amongst equals', as had been the case in the late 1940s\".{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=63}} After purging his WPK opposition, Kim Il-sung consolidated his power base with [[nepotism]] and hereditary succession in the Kim family and the guerilla faction.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=72}} Beginning in the late 1980s, \"a high (and increasing) proportion of North Korean high officials have been sons of high officials.\"{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=72}} Since the 1960s, Kim Il-sung had appointed family members to positions of power.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}} By the early 1990s, a number of leading national offices were held by people in his family: [[Kang Song-san]] ([[Premier of North Korea|Premier]] of the [[Government of North Korea|Administrative Council]] and member of the WPK Secretariat), [[Pak Song-chol]] ([[Vice President of North Korea|Vice President]]), [[Hwang Jang-yop]] and [[Kim Chung-rin]] (members of the WPK Secretariat), [[Kim Yong-sun]] (Head of the [[International Department of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK International Department]] and member of the WPK Secretariat), [[Kang Hui-won]] (Secretary of the [[Pyongyang Municipal Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Pyongyang Municipal Committee]] and Deputy Premier of the Administrative Council), [[Kim Tal-hyon]] ([[Ministry of Foreign Trade (North Korea)|Minister of Foreign Trade]]), [[Kim Chan-ju]] ([[Ministry of Agriculture (North Korea)|Minister of Agriculture]] and Deputy Chairman of the Administrative Council) and [[Yang Hyong-sop]] (President of the [[Academy of Social Sciences (North Korea)|Academy of Social Sciences]] and chairman of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}} These individuals were appointed solely because of their ties to the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]], and presumably retain their positions as long as the Kim family controls the WPK and the country.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}} The reason for Kim's support of nepotism (his own and that of the guerrilla faction) can be explained by the fact that he did not want the [[nomenklatura|party bureaucracy]] to threaten his\u2014and his son's\u2014rule as it did in other socialist states.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}}\n\nIt was first generally believed by foreign observers that Kim Il-sung was planning for his brother, [[Kim Yong-ju]], to succeed him.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} Kim Yong-ju's authority gradually increased, until he became co-chairman of the North\u2013South Coordination Committee.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} From late 1972 to the [[6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea|6th WPK Congress]], Kim Yong-ju became an increasingly remote figure in the regime.

Although the WPK claims to be [[socialist patriotism|socialist-patriotic]],{{sfn|Suh|1988|p=309}} some analysts claim its socialist patriotism would be more similar to [[bourgeois nationalism]]; the chief difference is that socialist patriotism is nationalism in a [[socialist state]].{{sfn|Suh|1988|pp=309\u2013310}} ''Juche'' developed as a reaction to foreign occupation, involvement and influence (primarily by the Chinese and Soviets) in North Korean affairs, and may be described \"as a normal and healthy reaction of the Korean people to the deprivation they suffered under foreign domination.\"{{sfn|Suh|1988|p=310}} However, there is nothing uniquely Marxist or Leninist in this reaction; the primary reason for its description as \"communist\" is that it occurred in a self-proclaimed socialist state.{{sfn|Suh|1988|p=310}} The WPK (and the North Korean leadership in general) have not explained in detail how their policies are Marxist, Leninist or communist; ''Juche'' is defined as \"Korean\", and the others as \"foreign\".{{sfn|Suh|1988|pp=310\u2013313}}\n\n====Basic tenets====\n{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=ivory|quote=You requested me to give a detailed explanation of the Juche idea.

he believed it would threaten the country's ability to develop socialism, which only a state with a strong, independent economy could do.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} ''Charip'' emphasizes an independent national economy based on [[heavy industry]]; this sector, in theory, would then drive the rest of the economy.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} Kim Jong-il said:{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}\n<blockquote>Building an independent national economy means building an economy which is free from dependence on others and which stands on its own feet, an economy which serves one\u2019s own people and develops on the strength of the resources of one\u2019s own country and by the efforts of one\u2019s people.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}</blockquote>\n\nKim Il-sung considered military independence (''chawi'') crucial.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}} Acknowledging that North Korea might need military support in a war against [[imperialism|imperialist enemies]], he emphasized a domestic response and summed up the party's (and state's) attitude towards military confrontation: \"We do not want war, nor are we afraid of it, nor do we beg peace from the imperialists.\"{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}\n\nAccording to ''Juche'', because of his [[consciousness]] man has ultimate control over himself and the ability to change the world.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=109}} This differs from classical Marxism, which believes that humans depend on their [[relations of production|relationship]] to the [[means of production]] more than on themselves.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=111}} The ''Juche'' view of a revolution led by a Great Leader, rather than a group of knowledgeable revolutionaries, is a break from [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] concept of a [[vanguard party]].{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=111}}\n\n===Nationalism===\n[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] did not clarify the difference between state and law, focusing on class divisions within nations.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=139}} They argued that nation and law (as it existed then) would be overthrown and replaced by [[proletariat|proletarian rule]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=139}} This was the mainstream view of Soviet theoreticians during the 1920s; however, with Stalin at the helm in 1929 it was under attack.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} He criticized [[Nikolai Bukharin]]'s position that the proletariat was hostile to the [[Marx's theory of the state|inclinations of the state]], arguing that since the state (the Soviet Union) was in transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]] the relationship between the state and the proletariat was harmonious.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} By 1936, Stalin argued that the state would still exist if the Soviet Union reached the [[pure communism|communist mode of production]] if the socialist world was encircled by capitalist forces.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} Kim Il-sung took this position to its logical conclusion, arguing that the state would exist after North Korea reached the communist mode of production until a future [[world revolution]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} As long as capitalism survived, even if the socialist world predominated, North Korea could still be threatened by the restoration of capitalism.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}}\n\nThe revival of the term \"state\" in the Soviet Union under Stalin led to the revival of \"nation\" in North Korea under Kim Il-sung.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} Despite official assertions that the Soviet Union was based on \"class\" rather than \"state\", the latter was revived during the 1930s.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} In 1955 Kim Il-sung expressed a similar view in his speech, \"On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work\":{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} <blockquote>What we are doing now is not a revolution in some foreign country but our Korean revolution. Therefore, every ideological action must benefit the Korean revolution. To fulfill the Korean revolution, one should be perfectly cognizant of the history of our national struggle, of Korea's geography, and our customs.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}}</blockquote>\nFrom then on, he and the WPK stressed the roles of \"revolutionary tradition\" and Korea's cultural tradition in its revolution.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} At party meetings, members and cadres learned about North Korea's national prestige and its coming rejuvenation.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} Traditional customs were revived, to showcase Korean-ness.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} By 1965, Kim Il-sung claimed that if communists continued opposing [[Individualism|individuality]] and [[sovereign state|sovereignty]], the movement would be threatened by [[dogmatism]] and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} He criticized those communists who, he believed, subscribed to \"national [[nihilism]] by praising all things foreign and vilifying all things national\" and tried to impose foreign models on their own country.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} By the 1960s, ''Juche'' was a full-fledged ideology calling for a distinct path for North Korean socialist construction and non-interference in its affairs; however, a decade later it was defined as a system whose \"fundamental principle was the realization of sovereignty\".{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}}\n\nAlthough WPK theoreticians were initially hostile towards the terms \"nation\" and \"nationalism\" because of the influence of the Stalinist definition of \"state\", by the 1970s their definition was changed from [[Marxism and the National Question|\"a stable, historically formed community of people based on common language, territory, economic life, and culture\"]] to include \"shared bloodline\".{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} During the 1980s a common economic life was removed from the definition, with shared bloodline receiving increased emphasis.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} With a democratic transition in South Korea and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the WPK revised the meaning of nationalism.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} Previously defined in Stalinist terms as a bourgeois weapon to exploit the workers, nationalism changed from a [[reactionary]] to a [[progressivism|progressive]] idea.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} Kim Il-sung differentiated \"nationalism\" from what he called \"genuine nationalism\"; while genuine nationalism was a progressive idea, nationalism remained reactionary:{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}}\n<blockquote>True nationalism (genuine nationalism) is similar to [[patriotism]]. Only a genuine patriot can become a devoted and true [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]]. In this sense, when I say communist, at the same time, I mean nationalist and internationalist.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}}</blockquote>\n\n====Allegations of xenophobia====\nDuring the 1960s the WPK began forcing ethnic Koreans to divorce their European spouses (who were primarily from the [[Eastern Bloc]]), with a high-ranking WPK official calling the marriages \"a crime against the Korean race\" and [[Eastern Bloc]] embassies in the country beginning to accuse the regime of [[fascism]].{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} In May 1963, a Soviet diplomat described Kim Il-sung's political circle as a \"political [[Gestapo]]\".{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} Similar remarks were made by other Eastern Bloc officials in North Korea, with the East German ambassador calling the policy \"Goebbelsian\" (a reference to [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|minister of propaganda]]).{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} Although this was said during a [[nadir]] in relations between North Korea and the Eastern Bloc, it illustrated a perception of racism in Kim Il-sung's policies.{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}}\n\nIn his book ''[[The Cleanest Race]]'' (2010), [[Brian Reynolds Myers]] dismisses the idea that ''Juche'' is North Korea's leading ideology. He views its public exaltation as designed to deceive foreigners; it exists to be praised rather than followed.<ref name=\"Rank\">{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/LD10Dg02.html |title=Lifting the cloak on North Korean secrecy: ''The Cleanest Race, How North Koreans See Themselves'' by B R Myers |first=Michael |last=Rank |date=10 April 2012 |accessdate=13 December 2012 |publisher=Asia Times}}</ref> Myers writes that ''Juche'' is a sham ideology, developed to extol Kim Il-sung as a political thinker comparable to [[Mao Zedong]].<ref name=\"3quarksdaily\">{{cite web |url=http://www.3quarksdaily.com/3quarksdaily/2010/04/immersion-in-propaganda-racebased-nationalism-and-the-unfigureoutable-vortex-of-juche-thought-colin-.html |title=Immersion in propaganda, race-based nationalism and the un-figure-outable vortex of Juche Thought: Colin Marshall talks to B.R.

However, these minor parties are completely subservient to the WPK,{{sfn|Cha|Hwang|2009|p=214}} and must accept the WPK's \"[[vanguard party|leading role]]\" as a condition of their existence.\n\nWPK was founded in 1949 with the merger of the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] and the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]]. The WPK also controls the [[Korean People's Army]]. WPK (and all of the other parties in the DPRK) remains illegal in [[South Korea]] under South Korea's own [[National Security Act (South Korea)|National Security Act]] and is sanctioned by [[Australia]], the [[European Union]], the [[United Nations]] and the [[United States]].<ref>[https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/03/16/executive-order-blocking-property-government-north-korea-and-workers Executive Order -- Blocking Property of the Government of North Korea and the Workers' Party of Korea, and Prohibiting Certain Transactions with Respect to North Korea]</ref>\n\nThe WPK is organized according to the [[Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System|Monolithic Ideological System]] and the [[Great Leader (concept)|Great Leader]], a system and theory conceived by [[Kim Yong-ju]] and [[Kim Jong-il]]. The highest body of the WPK is formally the Congress, but in practice a Congress occurs infrequently. Between 1980 and 2016, there were no congresses held. Although the WPK is organizationally similar to [[Communist party|communist parties]], in practice it is far less institutionalized and informal politics plays a larger role than usual. Institutions such as the [[Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Committee]], the [[Executive Policy Bureau of the Workers' Party of Korea|Executive Policy Bureau]], the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea|Central Military Commission]] (CMC), the [[Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Politburo]] and the Politburo's [[Presidium of the Politburo of the Workers' Party of Korea|Presidium]] have much less power than that formally bestowed on them by [[Charter of the Workers' Party of Korea|the party's charter]], which is little more than a nominal document. [[Kim Jong-un]] is the current WPK leader, serving as [[Chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea|Chairman]] and CMC chairman.\n\nThe WPK is committed to ''[[Juche]]'', an ideology which has been described as a combination of [[collectivism]] and [[Korean nationalism|nationalism]]; and at the 4th Conference (held in 2012), the party charter was amended to state that [[Kimilsungism\u2013Kimjongilism]] was \"the only guiding idea of the party\". At the 3rd Conference (held in 2010), the WPK removed a sentence from the preamble which expressed the party's commitment \"to building a [[pure communism|communist society]]\", replacing it with a new adherence to ''[[Songun]]'', the [[Militarism|\"military-first\" policies]] developed by Kim Jong-il. The 2009 revision had already removed all references to communism. Party ideology has recently focused on perceived [[Imperialism|imperialist]] enemies of the party and state; and on legitimizing the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]]'s dominance of the political system. Before the rise of ''Juche'' and later ''Songun'', the party was committed to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist\u2013Leninist thought]] as well, with its importance becoming greatly diminished over time.\n\nThe party's emblem is an adaptation of the communist [[hammer and sickle]], with a traditional [[Korean calligraphy]] brush. The symbols represent the industrial workers (hammer), peasants (sickle) and intelligentsia (ink brush).\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of the Workers' Party of Korea}}\n{{Infobox Korean name\n|title      = '''Workers' Party of Korea'''\n|image      = Workers' Party of Korea.svg\n|caption    = \"Workers' Party of Korea\" in [[Hancha]] (top) and [[Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl]] (bottom) scripts\n|context    = north\n|hangul     = {{linktext|\uc870\uc120|\ub85c\ub3d9|\ub2f9}}, {{linktext|\ubd81\ud55c|\ub178\ub3d9|\ub2f9}}\n|hanja      = {{linktext|lang=ko-Hant|\u671d\u9bae|\u52de\u52d5|\u9ee8}}, {{linktext|lang=ko-Hant|\u5317\u97d3|\u52de\u52d5|\u9ee8}}\n|mr         = Chos\u014fn Rodongdang, Bukhan Nodongdang\n|rr         = Joseon Rodongdang, Pukhan Nodongdang\n|tablewidth = 288\n|fontcolor  = #FFFF00\n|color      = {{Workers' Party of Korea/meta/color}}\n}}\n\n===Founding and early years (1945\u20131953)===\nOn 13 October 1945, the {{ill|North Korean Bureau of the Communist Party of Korea|ko|\ubd81\uc870\uc120\uacf5\uc0b0\ub2f9}} (NKB\u2013CPK) was established,{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=20}} with [[Kim Yong-bom]] its first chairman.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=21}} However, the NKB\u2013CPK remained subordinate to the [[Communist Party of Korea|CPK]] Central Committee (headquartered in Seoul and headed by [[Pak Hon-yong]]).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=22}} Two months later, at the 3rd Plenum of the NKB, Kim Yong-bom was replaced by [[Kim Il-sung]] (an event probably orchestrated by the Soviet Union).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=21\u201322}} In spring 1946 the North Korean Bureau became the [[Communist Party of North Korea]], with Kim Il-sung its elected chairman.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=28\u201329}} On 22 July 1946 Soviet authorities in North Korea established the [[Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland|United Democratic National Front]], a [[popular front]] led by the Communist Party of North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=29}} The Communist Party of North Korea soon merged with the [[New People's Party of Korea]], a party primarily composed of communists from China.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=29}} On 28 July 1946 a special commission of the two parties ratified the merger, and it became official the following day.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=31}} One month later (28\u201330 August 1946) the party held its [[1st Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea|founding congress]], establishing the [[Workers' Party of North Korea]] (WPNK).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=31}} The congress elected former leader of the New People's Party of Korea [[Kim Tu-bong]] as the first WPNK chairman, with Kim Il-sung its appointed deputy chairman.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=31}} However, despite his formal downgrade in the party's hierarchy Kim Il-sung remained its leader.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n[[File:Kim Il-sung and Pak Hon-yong, Baik Namun in Pyungyang.jpg|thumb|[[Kim Il-sung]] (left) with [[Pak Hon-yong]] in [[Pyongyang]], 1948]]\nParty control increased throughout the country after the congress.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=33\u201340}} From 27\u201330 March 1948, the WPNK convened its [[2nd Congress of the Workers' Party of North Korea|2nd Congress]].{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=40}} While Kim Tu-bong was still the party's formal head, Kim Il-sung presented the main report to the congress.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=42}} In it he claimed that North Korea was \"a base of democracy\", in contrast to South Korea (which was, he believed, dictatorial).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=42}} On 28 April 1948 a special session of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]] approved the constitution (proposed and written by WPNK cadres), which led to the official establishment of an independent North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=44}} It did not call for the establishment of an independent North Korea, but for a unified (communist) Korea; the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) would be Seoul, not Pyongyang.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=45}} Kim Il-sung was the appointed head of government of the new state, with Kim Tu-bong heading the legislative branch.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=47}} A year later on 30 June 1949, the Workers' Party of Korea was created with the merger of the WPNK and the [[Workers' Party of South Korea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/event/nkorea_nuclear/general_03c.htm|title=KBS WORLD Radio|work=kbs.co.kr}}</ref>\n\nKim Il-sung was not the most ardent supporter of a military reunification of Korea; that role was played by the South Korean communists, headed by Pak Hon-yong.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=60}} After several meetings with [[Joseph Stalin]] (the [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|leader of the Soviet Union]]), North Korea invaded South Korea on 25 June 1950\u2014and thus began the [[Korean War]].{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=61}} With American intervention in the war the DPRK nearly collapsed, but it was saved by Chinese intervention in the conflict.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=61}} The war had the effect of weakening Soviet influence over Kim Il-sung and the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}} Around this time, the main fault lines in early WPK politics were created. Four factions formed: domestic (a group of WPK cadres who had remained in Korea during Japanese rule), Soviet Koreans (Koreans sent from the Soviet Union), Yanan (Koreans from China) and guerrillas (Kim Il-sung's personal faction).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}} However, Kim would be unable to further strengthen his position until the end of the war.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}}\n\n===Kim Il-sung's consolidation of power (1953\u20131980)===\n[[File:Mosaic Depicting Kim Il Sungs Homecoming, Pyongyang, North Korea (2907648510).jpg|thumb|left|Propaganda mosaic commemorating the triumphant homecoming of Kim Il-sung after he liberated Korea from Japan]]\nRelations worsened between the WPK and the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) when Stalin's successor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], began pursuing a policy of [[de-Stalinization]].{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} During the [[Sino\u2013Soviet conflict]], an ideological conflict between the CPSU and the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), Kim Il-sung maneuvered between the two socialist superpowers; by doing so, he weakened their influence on the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} By 1962 Kim Il-sung and the WPK favored the CPC over the CPSU in the ideological struggle, and \"for a few years North Korea almost unconditionally supported the Chinese position on all important issues.\"{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} The primary conflict between the WPK and the CPSU during this period was that Kim Il-sung did not support the denunciation of [[Stalinism]] (including Stalin's [[cult of personality]]), the creation of a [[collective leadership]] and the theory of [[peaceful coexistence]] between the capitalist and socialist worlds.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} Kim Il-sung believed peaceful coexistence synonymous with capitulation, and knew that de-Stalinization in North Korea would effectively end his unlimited power over the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=65}} The result of the souring of relations between the CPSU and the WPK was that the Soviet Union discontinued aid to North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} As a result, several industries were on the brink of disaster; China was unwilling to increase aid to North Korea.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} [[Mao Zedong]] began the [[Cultural Revolution]] shortly thereafter, an event criticized by the WPK as \"left-wing opportunism\" and a manifestation of the \"[[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]] theory of a [[permanent revolution]].\"{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} Relations towards the CPSU and the CPC stabilized during the 1960s, with the WPK making it clear it would remain neutral in the Sino\u2013Soviet conflict,{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}} thus resulting in the 1966 launch of the ''Juche'' program aimed at national self-determination at all levels. This, in turn, strengthened Kim Il-Sung's position in the WPK.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=66}}\n\nBeginning in the 1960s, Kim Il-sung's cult of personality reached new heights.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=70}} It had been no greater than Stalin's or Mao's until 1972, when [[Day of the Sun|his birthday]] on April 15 became the country's main [[Public holidays in North Korea|public holiday]] and statues of him began to be built nationwide.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=70}} Kim became known as \"Great Leader\", the \"Sun of the Nation\", \"The Iron All-Victorious General\" and \"Marshal of the All-Mighty Republic\" in WPK and state publications; official propaganda stated that \"burning loyalty to the leader\" was one of the main characteristics of any Korean.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=70}}\n\nKim Il-sung and his guerilla faction had purged the WPK of its opposing factions during the 1950s and the 1960s, to the dismay of both the CPC and the CPSU.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=62}} The domestic faction was the first to go (in 1953\u201355), followed by the Yan'an faction in 1957\u201358 and the Soviet Koreans (along with anyone else deemed unfaithful to the WPK leadership) in the 1957\u201362 purge.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|pp=62\u201363}} According to historian [[Andrei Lankov]], \"Kim Il-sung had become not only supreme, but also the omnipotent ruler of North Korea\u2014no longer merely 'first amongst equals', as had been the case in the late 1940s\".{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=63}} After purging his WPK opposition, Kim Il-sung consolidated his power base with [[nepotism]] and hereditary succession in the Kim family and the guerilla faction.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=72}} Beginning in the late 1980s, \"a high (and increasing) proportion of North Korean high officials have been sons of high officials.\"{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=72}} Since the 1960s, Kim Il-sung had appointed family members to positions of power.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}} By the early 1990s, a number of leading national offices were held by people in his family: [[Kang Song-san]] ([[Premier of North Korea|Premier]] of the [[Government of North Korea|Administrative Council]] and member of the WPK Secretariat), [[Pak Song-chol]] ([[Vice President of North Korea|Vice President]]), [[Hwang Jang-yop]] and [[Kim Chung-rin]] (members of the WPK Secretariat), [[Kim Yong-sun]] (Head of the [[International Department of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK International Department]] and member of the WPK Secretariat), [[Kang Hui-won]] (Secretary of the [[Pyongyang Municipal Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Pyongyang Municipal Committee]] and Deputy Premier of the Administrative Council), [[Kim Tal-hyon]] ([[Ministry of Foreign Trade (North Korea)|Minister of Foreign Trade]]), [[Kim Chan-ju]] ([[Ministry of Agriculture (North Korea)|Minister of Agriculture]] and Deputy Chairman of the Administrative Council) and [[Yang Hyong-sop]] (President of the [[Academy of Social Sciences (North Korea)|Academy of Social Sciences]] and chairman of the [[Supreme People's Assembly]]).{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}} These individuals were appointed solely because of their ties to the [[Kim dynasty (North Korea)|Kim family]], and presumably retain their positions as long as the Kim family controls the WPK and the country.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}} The reason for Kim's support of nepotism (his own and that of the guerrilla faction) can be explained by the fact that he did not want the [[nomenklatura|party bureaucracy]] to threaten his\u2014and his son's\u2014rule as it did in other socialist states.{{sfn|Lankov|2002|p=73}}\n\nIt was first generally believed by foreign observers that Kim Il-sung was planning for his brother, [[Kim Yong-ju]], to succeed him.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} Kim Yong-ju's authority gradually increased, until he became co-chairman of the North\u2013South Coordination Committee.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} From late 1972 to the [[6th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea|6th WPK Congress]], Kim Yong-ju became an increasingly remote figure in the regime. At the 6th Congress he lost his Politburo and Central Committee seats,{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} and rumors that Kim Il-sung had begun grooming Kim Jong-il in 1966 were confirmed.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} From 1974 to the 6th Congress, Kim Jong-il (called the \"Party centre\" by North Korean media) was the second most powerful man in North Korea.{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=442}} His selection was criticized, with his father accused of creating a dynasty or turning North Korea into a [[Feudalism|feudal state]].{{sfn|Lee|1982|p=434}}\n\n===Kim Jong-il's apprenticeship and rule (1980\u20132011)===\n[[File:Kim Jong il Portrait.jpg|thumb|Although [[Kim Jong-il]] headed the WPK with no pretense of following the party charter, it was revitalized at the 3rd Conference at the end of his rule]]\nWith Kim Jong-il's official appointment as [[heir apparent]] at the 6th Congress, power became more centralized in the Kim family.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|p=105}} WPK officials began to speak openly about his succession, and beginning in 1981 he began to participate in (and lead) tours.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|p=105}} In 1982 he was made a [[Hero of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] and wrote ''[[On the Juche Idea]]''.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|p=105}} While foreign observers believed that Kim Jong-il's appointment would increase participation by the younger generation, in ''On the Juche Idea'' he made it clear that his leadership would not mark the beginning of a new generation of leaders.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|pp=105\u2013106}} The WPK could not address the crisis facing Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il's leadership at home and abroad, in part because of the [[gerontocracy]] at the highest level of the WPK and the state.{{sfn|Buzo|1999|p=106}}\n\nWith the death of [[O Jin-u]] on 25 February 1995, Kim Jong-il became the sole remaining living member of the Presidium (the highest body of the WPK when the Politburo and the Central Committee are not in session).{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=7}} While no member list of the [[Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea|WPK Central Military Commission]] (CMC, the highest party organ on military affairs) was published from 1993 to 2010, there were clear signs of movement in the military hierarchy during 1995.{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=8}} For the WPK's 50th anniversary, Kim Jong-il initiated a reshuffling of the CMC (and the military leadership in general) to appease the old guard and younger officials.{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=8}} He did not reshuffle the WPK Central Committee or the government, however, and during the 1990s the changes to its membership were caused mostly by its members [[Death by natural causes|dying of natural causes]].{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=11}}\n\nBeginning in 1995, Kim Jong-il favored the military over the WPK and the state.{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=11}} Problems began to mount as an [[economic crisis]], coupled with a [[North Korean famine|famine]] in which at least half a million people died, weakened his control of the country.{{sfn|Gause|2011|pp=11\u201313}} Instead of recommending structural reforms Kim began to criticize the WPK's lack of control over the economy, lambasting its local and provincial branches for their inability to implement central-level instructions.{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=13}} At a speech celebrating the 50th anniversary of [[Kim Il-sung University]], he said: \"The reason why people are loyal to the instructions of the Central Committee is not because of party organizations and workers, but because of my authority.\"{{sfn|Gause|2011|p=13}} Kim Jong-il said that his father had told him to avoid economics, claiming that it was better left to experts.

Although the WPK claims to be [[socialist patriotism|socialist-patriotic]],{{sfn|Suh|1988|p=309}} some analysts claim its socialist patriotism would be more similar to [[bourgeois nationalism]]; the chief difference is that socialist patriotism is nationalism in a [[socialist state]].{{sfn|Suh|1988|pp=309\u2013310}} ''Juche'' developed as a reaction to foreign occupation, involvement and influence (primarily by the Chinese and Soviets) in North Korean affairs, and may be described \"as a normal and healthy reaction of the Korean people to the deprivation they suffered under foreign domination.\"{{sfn|Suh|1988|p=310}} However, there is nothing uniquely Marxist or Leninist in this reaction; the primary reason for its description as \"communist\" is that it occurred in a self-proclaimed socialist state.{{sfn|Suh|1988|p=310}} The WPK (and the North Korean leadership in general) have not explained in detail how their policies are Marxist, Leninist or communist; ''Juche'' is defined as \"Korean\", and the others as \"foreign\".{{sfn|Suh|1988|pp=310\u2013313}}\n\n====Basic tenets====\n{{quote box|width=25em|align=right|bgcolor=ivory|quote=You requested me to give a detailed explanation of the Juche idea.

he believed it would threaten the country's ability to develop socialism, which only a state with a strong, independent economy could do.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} ''Charip'' emphasizes an independent national economy based on [[heavy industry]]; this sector, in theory, would then drive the rest of the economy.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=106}} Kim Jong-il said:{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}\n<blockquote>Building an independent national economy means building an economy which is free from dependence on others and which stands on its own feet, an economy which serves one\u2019s own people and develops on the strength of the resources of one\u2019s own country and by the efforts of one\u2019s people.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}</blockquote>\n\nKim Il-sung considered military independence (''chawi'') crucial.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}} Acknowledging that North Korea might need military support in a war against [[imperialism|imperialist enemies]], he emphasized a domestic response and summed up the party's (and state's) attitude towards military confrontation: \"We do not want war, nor are we afraid of it, nor do we beg peace from the imperialists.\"{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=107}}\n\nAccording to ''Juche'', because of his [[consciousness]] man has ultimate control over himself and the ability to change the world.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=109}} This differs from classical Marxism, which believes that humans depend on their [[relations of production|relationship]] to the [[means of production]] more than on themselves.{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=111}} The ''Juche'' view of a revolution led by a Great Leader, rather than a group of knowledgeable revolutionaries, is a break from [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] concept of a [[vanguard party]].{{sfn|Lee|2003|p=111}}\n\n===Nationalism===\n[[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] did not clarify the difference between state and law, focusing on class divisions within nations.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=139}} They argued that nation and law (as it existed then) would be overthrown and replaced by [[proletariat|proletarian rule]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=139}} This was the mainstream view of Soviet theoreticians during the 1920s; however, with Stalin at the helm in 1929 it was under attack.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} He criticized [[Nikolai Bukharin]]'s position that the proletariat was hostile to the [[Marx's theory of the state|inclinations of the state]], arguing that since the state (the Soviet Union) was in transition from [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalism]] to [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialism]] the relationship between the state and the proletariat was harmonious.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} By 1936, Stalin argued that the state would still exist if the Soviet Union reached the [[pure communism|communist mode of production]] if the socialist world was encircled by capitalist forces.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} Kim Il-sung took this position to its logical conclusion, arguing that the state would exist after North Korea reached the communist mode of production until a future [[world revolution]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=140}} As long as capitalism survived, even if the socialist world predominated, North Korea could still be threatened by the restoration of capitalism.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}}\n\nThe revival of the term \"state\" in the Soviet Union under Stalin led to the revival of \"nation\" in North Korea under Kim Il-sung.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} Despite official assertions that the Soviet Union was based on \"class\" rather than \"state\", the latter was revived during the 1930s.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} In 1955 Kim Il-sung expressed a similar view in his speech, \"On Eliminating Dogmatism and Formalism and Establishing Juche in Ideological Work\":{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} <blockquote>What we are doing now is not a revolution in some foreign country but our Korean revolution. Therefore, every ideological action must benefit the Korean revolution. To fulfill the Korean revolution, one should be perfectly cognizant of the history of our national struggle, of Korea's geography, and our customs.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}}</blockquote>\nFrom then on, he and the WPK stressed the roles of \"revolutionary tradition\" and Korea's cultural tradition in its revolution.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} At party meetings, members and cadres learned about North Korea's national prestige and its coming rejuvenation.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} Traditional customs were revived, to showcase Korean-ness.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=141}} By 1965, Kim Il-sung claimed that if communists continued opposing [[Individualism|individuality]] and [[sovereign state|sovereignty]], the movement would be threatened by [[dogmatism]] and [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]].{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} He criticized those communists who, he believed, subscribed to \"national [[nihilism]] by praising all things foreign and vilifying all things national\" and tried to impose foreign models on their own country.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} By the 1960s, ''Juche'' was a full-fledged ideology calling for a distinct path for North Korean socialist construction and non-interference in its affairs; however, a decade later it was defined as a system whose \"fundamental principle was the realization of sovereignty\".{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}}\n\nAlthough WPK theoreticians were initially hostile towards the terms \"nation\" and \"nationalism\" because of the influence of the Stalinist definition of \"state\", by the 1970s their definition was changed from [[Marxism and the National Question|\"a stable, historically formed community of people based on common language, territory, economic life, and culture\"]] to include \"shared bloodline\".{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=142}} During the 1980s a common economic life was removed from the definition, with shared bloodline receiving increased emphasis.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} With a democratic transition in South Korea and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the WPK revised the meaning of nationalism.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} Previously defined in Stalinist terms as a bourgeois weapon to exploit the workers, nationalism changed from a [[reactionary]] to a [[progressivism|progressive]] idea.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}} Kim Il-sung differentiated \"nationalism\" from what he called \"genuine nationalism\"; while genuine nationalism was a progressive idea, nationalism remained reactionary:{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}}\n<blockquote>True nationalism (genuine nationalism) is similar to [[patriotism]]. Only a genuine patriot can become a devoted and true [[Proletarian internationalism|internationalist]]. In this sense, when I say communist, at the same time, I mean nationalist and internationalist.{{sfn|Cheong|2000|p=143}}</blockquote>\n\n====Allegations of xenophobia====\nDuring the 1960s the WPK began forcing ethnic Koreans to divorce their European spouses (who were primarily from the [[Eastern Bloc]]), with a high-ranking WPK official calling the marriages \"a crime against the Korean race\" and [[Eastern Bloc]] embassies in the country beginning to accuse the regime of [[fascism]].{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} In May 1963, a Soviet diplomat described Kim Il-sung's political circle as a \"political [[Gestapo]]\".{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} Similar remarks were made by other Eastern Bloc officials in North Korea, with the East German ambassador calling the policy \"Goebbelsian\" (a reference to [[Joseph Goebbels]], [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|minister of propaganda]]).{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}} Although this was said during a [[nadir]] in relations between North Korea and the Eastern Bloc, it illustrated a perception of racism in Kim Il-sung's policies.{{sfn|Becker|2005|p=66}}\n\nIn his book ''[[The Cleanest Race]]'' (2010), [[Brian Reynolds Myers]] dismisses the idea that ''Juche'' is North Korea's leading ideology.

Although he studied psychology at the university, his passion was Art. He learned the theory and practice of music with masters like Mehrtash. He also studied acting and directing for four years with Mostafa Oskouei and later became his assistant.\n\n== Career==\nHe started his acting career by playing small roles in plays produced and directed by Oskouei. He directed the play ''Sisyphe et la mort'' written by Robert Merle in 1973. The next year his short film ''Papoli Jan'' won the first prize of the ABU Asian Film Festival. In 1975 he took an adaptation of Dostoevsky's ''Crime and Punishment'' to the stage. His first work as a director on Television was ''The Elevator'' (1983), written by Hossein Panahi. Playing the role of Amir Nejati, caught in the governmental bureaucracy, in this piece brought Najafian fame and for many years people recalled him by that name. In the sixties he and Panahi collaborated in writing and directing many tele-theaters such as ''Flower and Spring'' (1984),''Two Ducks in the Mist'' (1985), ''American Style'' (1986), ''Like a Smile'' (1991). He was one of the writers of one of the most popular television series in Iran ''Ziba Barbershop'' (1994) directed by Marzieh boroumand. He adapted [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]]'s short stories for tele-theater in 1989 and directed them for channel 2.\n\nHe has worked as an actor with directors such as Behrouz Afkhami in ''Mirza Kuchak Khan'' (1983), and Davood Mirbagheri in ''The Wolves'' (1985) and ''Ra'na'' (1986). He worked later with Mirbagheri on stage where he performed in one of the lead roles in ''Loveville'' (\u0639\u0634\u0642 \u0622\u0628\u0627\u062f) (1996) which is among the most commercially successful plays in Iran.\n\nIn 1988 Najafian worked as the assistant to the director Saeid Ebrahimifar in the critically acclaimed movie ''Fire and Reed'' (\u0646\u0627\u0631 \u0648 \u0646\u06cc).
