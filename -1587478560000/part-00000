It extends from the northern border of the prefecture with [[Nagano Prefecture]] to the south until it almost reaches the prefecture's southern border. It is narrow along its east-west axis. The city bisects the K\u014dfu Basin and is 250 to 300 meters above sea level. K\u014dfu is surrounded by mountains on all sides. Three quarters of K\u014dfu's territory is a part of [[Mount Kinpu]] in the north. Much of the northern portion of the city is within the [[Chichibu-Tama-Kai National Park]]. [[Mt. Fuji]] is visible in the distance from K\u014dfu to the south.\n\n=== Surrounding municipalities ===\n* [[Yamanashi Prefecture]]\n** [[Kai, Yamanashi|Kai]]\n**[[Yamanashi, Yamanashi|Yamanashi]]\n**[[Fuefuki]]\n**[[Hokuto, Yamanashi|Hokuto]]\n**[[Ch\u016b\u014d, Yamanashi|Ch\u016b\u014d]]\n**[[Sh\u014dwa, Yamanashi|Sh\u014dwa]]\n**[[Fujikawaguchiko, Yamanashi|Fujikawaguchiko]]\n**[[Ichikawamisato, Yamanashi|Ichikawamisato]]\n**[[Minobu, Yamanashi|Minobu]]\n* [[Nagano Prefecture]]\n** [[Kawakami, Nagano|Kawakami]]\n\n==Demographics==\nPer Japanese census data,<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/php/japan-yamanashi.php K\u014dfu population statistics]</ref> the population of K\u014dfu has remained relatively stable over the past 40 years.\n\n{{Historical populations\n| 1940 | 102,419\n| 1950 | 121,645\n| 1960 | 160,963\n| 1970 | 182,669\n| 1980 | 199,262\n| 1990 | 200,626\n| 2000 | 196,154\n| 2010 | 198,992\n|align       = none\n| footnote = \n}}\n\n{{Wide image|Kofu Basin panorama from Mt Atago Nov. 2013.jpg|1500px|An overview at Kofu city from Mount Atago.

continuous settlement through the [[J\u014dmon period|J\u014dmon]], [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] and [[Kofun period]]s. During the [[Nara period]], the [[provincial temple]] of Kai Province was established in what is now K\u014dfu, indicating that the Nara period provincial capital was located nearby, as the name of the city implies. During the [[Heian period]], a branch of the [[Minamoto clan]], the \u201cKai-Genji\u201d ruled over vast ''[[sh\u014den]]'' estates, and developed  a military force noted for its use of [[cavalry]]. By the [[Muromachi period]], a branch of the Kai-Genji, the [[Takeda clan]] came to dominate the area, and built a castle in what is now part of K\u014dfu.\n\nUnder the rule of [[Takeda Nobutora]], K\u014dfu was rebuilt as a [[castle town]] starting in 1519, and remained the capital of the Takeda clan under [[Takeda Shingen]] and his son [[Takeda Katsuyori]]. \nDuring the [[Edo period]], Kai Province was ''[[tenry\u014d]]'' territory ruled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, and [[K\u014dfu Castle]] remained its administrative center. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], with the establishment of the modern municipalities system, the town of K\u014dfu was proclaimed on July 1, 1889.\n\n[[File:Flood disaster of 1907 of Kofu-City.jpg|thumb|left|1907 K\u014dfu Flood]]\n\nThe city experienced a major flood disaster in 1907 (\u660e\u6cbb40\u5e74\u306e\u5927\u6c34\u5bb3) caused by heavy rain in a typhoon from the night of August 21, 1907 and by  deforestation which was accelerated in Yamanashi Prefecture, due to the need for wood for fuel of the steam engines of the growing industrial policy of the Fujimura Prefectural Government. A police officer inspected the stricken area from August 23 to October 10 1907. Patrol diaries of Masaki Tsukasa Kasaburo said \"This heavy rainfall causes rivers to run down, landslides and levee failures, bridge piers destruction, etc., resulting in the destruction of homes and villages, village isolation, runoff and runoff, and traffic disruptions caused serious damage.<ref>Iwami Ryotaro \"Water Damage and Flood Control\" \"Great Water Damage\" \"The History of Yamanashi Prefecture History Series 5 Modern 1\" Yamanashi Prefecture, 2005</ref> 233 people died, 5757 houses were run out, 650 hectares of lands have been buried or run down, 3353 landslides, collapse and damage distance of about 140 kilometers of levees, runoff and burial of roads, the damage distance was about 500 kilometers, 393 telephone poles collapsed.

continuous settlement through the [[J\u014dmon period|J\u014dmon]], [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]] and [[Kofun period]]s. During the [[Nara period]], the [[provincial temple]] of Kai Province was established in what is now K\u014dfu, indicating that the Nara period provincial capital was located nearby, as the name of the city implies. During the [[Heian period]], a branch of the [[Minamoto clan]], the \u201cKai-Genji\u201d ruled over vast ''[[sh\u014den]]'' estates, and developed  a military force noted for its use of [[cavalry]]. By the [[Muromachi period]], a branch of the Kai-Genji, the [[Takeda clan]] came to dominate the area, and built a castle in what is now part of K\u014dfu.\n\nUnder the rule of [[Takeda Nobutora]], K\u014dfu was rebuilt as a [[castle town]] starting in 1519, and remained the capital of the Takeda clan under [[Takeda Shingen]] and his son [[Takeda Katsuyori]]. \nDuring the [[Edo period]], Kai Province was ''[[tenry\u014d]]'' territory ruled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, and [[K\u014dfu Castle]] remained its administrative center. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], with the establishment of the modern municipalities system, the town of K\u014dfu was proclaimed on July 1, 1889.\n\n[[File:Flood disaster of 1907 of Kofu-City.jpg|thumb|left|1907 K\u014dfu Flood]]\n\nThe city experienced a major flood disaster in 1907 (\u660e\u6cbb40\u5e74\u306e\u5927\u6c34\u5bb3) caused by heavy rain in a typhoon from the night of August 21, 1907 and by  deforestation which was accelerated in Yamanashi Prefecture, due to the need for wood for fuel of the steam engines of the growing industrial policy of the Fujimura Prefectural Government. A police officer inspected the stricken area from August 23 to October 10 1907.

The first incident occurred in February 1920 when Mexican bandits robbed and killed the two owners of the Ruby Mercantile. A second attack happened in April 1921 when Mexican bandits robbed and killed the store's owners. Two of the bandits were arrested for the crime, but they briefly escaped custody in July 1922 after killing another two men, which led to the largest manhunt in the history of the Southwest.<ref>{{cite book|title=Ghost Towns of Arizona|first=James E|last=Sherman|author2=Barbara H.

Ruby was very small and its one general store was the sole business other than mining. The store was called the Ruby Mercantile, built sometime in the late 1880s, and it also served as the post office when it opened in 1912. In 1914, the mercantile was purchased by Philip C. Clarke, who later built a larger store a short distance from the original. The second building was an adobe structure, the remains of which have been preserved.<ref name=p1/>\n\nThe [[Mexican Revolution]] erupted in 1910, and the town's proximity to the international border meant that it was harassed by bandits and rebels on many occasions. Rebels loyal to [[Pancho Villa]] were active throughout the Mexican territory opposite the Arizona border. The area was one of the hardest hit during the civil war, which fueled the lawlessness. By 1920, the town was declining, but it was still considered quite dangerous; the inhabitants were instructed to be heavily armed at all times. Clarke felt that the area was so dangerous that he kept either a pistol or a rifle in each room of his house and the store.<ref name=p1/>\n\n==Murders==\n[[File:Ruby AZ.jpg|200px|thumb|Ruby in 1990; the remains of the mercantile can be seen at the far right]]\n\n;February 27, 1920\nIn February 1920, Clarke sold the mercantile to John and Alexander Frazer before moving his family to the nearby settlement of Oro Blanco. \nEleven days after closing the deal with Clarke, on February 27, 1920, the Frazer brothers were both shot during a robbery of the store.<ref name=\"Dolan, Samuel K. 2016\">Dolan, Samuel K. ''Cowboys and Gangsters: Stories of an Untamed Southwest'' (TwoDot Books, 2016) {{ISBN|978-1-4422-4669-0}}.</ref> Alexander was found lying on the floor near the [[cash register]]. He had been shot twice; one bullet wound was found in Alexander's head and the second in his back. John was found nearby. He was still alive, but unconscious, having been hit in the left eye by one bullet. He died five hours later without regaining consciousness. An investigation by police found that the bandits, later identified as Ezequiel Lara and Manuel Garcia, had robbed the place and cut the wires for the town's only telephone, which was located in the store. The police discovered two sets of footprints and also learned from the townspeople that two unknown Mexicans had been seen in the area. A local rancher reported that two of his best horses and eight of his cattle had been stolen at or near the same date, making the police assume the incidents were related. The [[Nogales, Arizona|Nogales]] [[newspaper]] ''Weekly Oasis'' said that the \n<blockquote>tragedy is nothing new over there. In the wild and rugged region south from the [[Atascosa Mountains]] and the Bear Valley region, there has been always a harbor for a bunch of desperate characters, whose depredations have been felt by American cattlemen and ranchers through many years.</blockquote>\nA posse led by Sheriff Raymond Earhardt was sent south along the bandit's trail, but they failed to catch up with the suspects.<ref name=\"Dolan, Samuel K. 2016\"/> Months passed, during which time very little progress was made in the investigation. Finally, in October 1920, Garcia was killed during a gunfight with Pima County deputy sheriffs near Twin Buttes. Lara was eventually arrested in Mexico and jailed for crimes south of the border, but was never called to answer for his role in the Fraser killings.<ref name=\"Dolan, Samuel K. 2016\"/>\n\n;August 26, 1921\nThe second incident occurred in August 1921 following the transfer of the mercantile's ownership to a Mr. and Mrs. Frank Pearson, who lived in the store with their three daughters.<ref name=\"Dolan, Samuel K. 2016\"/> Although Mr. Pearson was told about the previous killings and the situation on the border, he felt that a second attack on the store was unlikely to happen. However, on the morning of April 26, Frank and his wife Myrtle took a horseback ride into the surrounding hills and while doing so they spotted a group of seven Mexicans riding towards the town. The two thought that the Mexicans would likely want to visit the mercantile so they rode back to service them. When the Mexicans entered the store they asked for [[tobacco]], but as soon as Mr. Pearson turned around to get it the bandits drew their pistols and fired into his back. Pearson was mortally wounded by two bullets, but he managed to grab his pistol under the counter and fire three shots wildly before dying.<ref name=p2>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-ruby2.html |title=Ruby, Arizona - A Ghost Town Filled With Mining and Murder |publisher=Legends of America |page=2}}</ref>\n\nAfter that the murderers turned their attention to Myrtle, who had five gold teeth. First, one bandit shot Myrtle in the neck to stop her from screaming and then he knocked out her gold teeth with his pistol. She was then shot a second time in the head and killed. Frank's daughter Elizabeth was also grazed in the arm, but other than that the three young girls were left unharmed. The Mexicans left after they emptied the safe and destroyed the telephone. They then rode out of town yelling and firing their guns in the air. When the Mexicans were gone the Pearson girls fled eight miles away to the nearest neighbor. This time when authorities were called for and [[ambulance]] was sent from Nogales, which tended to Elizabeth's wounds. Meanwhile, a large posse of citizens and lawmen began searching the surrounding desert. A [[United States Army]] [[biplane]] from the [[garrison]] at Nogales was also dispatched to participate in the search and it became the first aircraft to be used for a manhunt in the history of Arizona. A [[US$|$]]5,000 bounty, dead or alive, was also authorized for each of the seven Mexicans, partly due to the fact that the gang was suspected of being responsible for the first robbery.\n\n;July 13, 1922\nA few months later, after the manhunt had ended unsuccessfully, the authorities received news that two men in a [[Sonora, Mexico|Sonora]] [[cantina]] had bragged about being responsible for robbing the Ruby Mercantile. American police investigated the claim, but it wasn't until April 1922 that any arrests were made. By chance, an Arizona [[deputy sheriff]] overheard a conversation between the [[bartender]] and a customer at a cantina in Sasabe, Sonora; the bartender was trying to sell five gold teeth he had acquired sometime earlier by an outlaw named Manuel Martinez. When the deputy saw the teeth, he was sure they belonged to Myrtle so he bought them and took them back to the United States. Martinez was known for associating with a Mexican named Placidio Silvas, who lived near Oro Blanco, so the two were arrested and put on trial for murder in May 1922. Both were found guilty of murder by the court of [[Santa Cruz County, Arizona|Santa Cruz County]]. Martinez was sentenced to be hanged and Silvas received a life sentence to be served at the [[Arizona State Prison Complex \u2013 Florence|state prison]] in [[Florence, Arizona|Florence]]. However, on July 13, while they were being transported in a police car, the two prisoners managed to break free after Sheriff George White wrecked the car he and deputy L.A. Smith were transporting the prisoners in.<ref>[https://www.odmp.org/officer/14073-sheriff-george-james-white ODMP memorial for White and Smith]</ref> The police car was found later that day, rolled into a ditch near Continental, with the bodies of White and Smith nearby. White was killed at the scene, but Smith was still alive and taken to a hospital, where he died of his wounds.<ref name=\"Dolan, Samuel K. 2016\"/><ref name=p3>{{cite web |url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-ruby3.html |title=Ruby, Arizona - A Ghost Town Filled With Mining and Murder |publisher=Legends of America |page=3}}</ref>\n\nThe men who found White and Smith trailed the outlaws across the [[Santa Rita Mountains]], but they lost track of them near Ruby due to a [[Arizona Monsoon|monsoon]]. The Arizona public was shocked about this latest double homicide so over 700 volunteers from [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima]], [[Pinal County, Arizona|Pinal]], [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise]] and Santa Cruz counties formed posses for the largest manhunt in the history of the Southwest. Initially, Martinez and Silvas evaded the search parties, but, six days after escaping, search dogs uncovered a blood stained file, which put the posses back on the bandits' trail. That same day, Martinez and Silvas were found hiding under some brush in the [[Tumacacori National Forest|Tumacacori Mountains]], about seventy miles from the site where the two had escaped custody. The two Mexicans were re-tried in court and found guilty again, but the Mexican [[consul (representative)|consul]] appealed the court's decision and obtained a [[writ]], which delayed the case. Finally, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] intervened and the matter was settled. Martinez was sentenced to death and executed by hanging on August 10, 1923. Silvas was put into prison at Florence, but he later escaped in 1928, never to be seen again.<ref name=p3/>\n\n==Further reading==\nThe Ruby Murders have been covered by a number of historians, including Al Ring, Bob Ring and Talia Cahoon in their 2005 history of Ruby, ''Ruby Arizona: Mining, Mayhem and Murder.''<ref>Ring, Al, Ring, Bob, Cahoon, Talia, ''Ruby, Arizona: Mining, Mayhem and Murder'' (US Press and Graphics, 2005) {{ISBN|0974805955}}</ref> Samuel K.

Smith were transporting the prisoners in.<ref>[https://www.odmp.org/officer/14073-sheriff-george-james-white ODMP memorial for White and Smith]</ref> The police car was found later that day, rolled into a ditch near Continental, with the bodies of White and Smith nearby.

The Arizona public was shocked about this latest double homicide so over 700 volunteers from [[Pima County, Arizona|Pima]], [[Pinal County, Arizona|Pinal]], [[Cochise County, Arizona|Cochise]] and Santa Cruz counties formed posses for the largest manhunt in the history of the Southwest. Initially, Martinez and Silvas evaded the search parties, but, six days after escaping, search dogs uncovered a blood stained file, which put the posses back on the bandits' trail. That same day, Martinez and Silvas were found hiding under some brush in the [[Tumacacori National Forest|Tumacacori Mountains]], about seventy miles from the site where the two had escaped custody. The two Mexicans were re-tried in court and found guilty again, but the Mexican [[consul (representative)|consul]] appealed the court's decision and obtained a [[writ]], which delayed the case. Finally, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] intervened and the matter was settled. Martinez was sentenced to death and executed by hanging on August 10, 1923. Silvas was put into prison at Florence, but he later escaped in 1928, never to be seen again.<ref name=p3/>\n\n==Further reading==\nThe Ruby Murders have been covered by a number of historians, including Al Ring, Bob Ring and Talia Cahoon in their 2005 history of Ruby, ''Ruby Arizona: Mining, Mayhem and Murder.''<ref>Ring, Al, Ring, Bob, Cahoon, Talia, ''Ruby, Arizona: Mining, Mayhem and Murder'' (US Press and Graphics, 2005) {{ISBN|0974805955}}</ref> Samuel K.

The new Katangese state did not enjoy full support throughout the province and was constantly plagued by ethnic strife in its northernmost region. It was dissolved in 1963 following an invasion by [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) forces, and reintegrated with the rest of the country as [[Katanga Province]].\n\nThe Katangese secession was made with the support of [[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga]], a [[Belgium|Belgian]] mining company, and a large contingent of Belgian military advisers.<ref name=Mockler>{{cite book|last=Mockler|first=Antony|title=The New Mercenaries: The History of the Hired Soldier from the Congo to the Seychelles|date=1987|pages=37\u201355|publisher=Paragon House Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-913729-72-8}}</ref> A paramilitary force designated the [[Katangese Gendarmerie|Katanga Gendarmerie]], raised by the Tshombe government, was initially organised and trained by Belgium and subsequently, mercenaries of various nationalities.<ref>For more on the Gendarmerie, see Jules G\u00e9rard-Libois, 'Katanga Secession,' University of Wisconsin Press, 1966, 114\u2013115, 155\u2013174.</ref>\n\n==Congo Crisis==\n{{main|Congo Crisis}}\n{{further|Katangese Gendarmerie}}\n\n===The initial secession===\n[[File:UMHK 1917.jpg|thumb|A {{lang|fr|[[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut-Katanga]]}} (UMHK) copper mine, pictured in 1917. Katanga's mineral wealth played an important part in the secession.]]\n\nIn 1906, the ''[[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga]]'' (UMHK) company was founded and was granted the exclusive rights to mine copper in Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=2}} The principle shareholders in the ''Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut-Katanga'' were ''Comit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cial de Katanga'', the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale'' and the British Tanganyika Concessions Limited.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=2}} In turn, the largest shareholder in the ''Comit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cial de Katanga'' was the Belgian state.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=2}} As 33.7% of the revenue of the Congo came from the sale of the copper mined in Katanga, ownership of the company was an important consideration for the leaders the Congolese Independence movement while the Belgian government was most reluctant to give up its share in the UMHK, and did not finally do so until 1967.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=2}} In January 1959, it was announced that Beligum would grant independence to the Congo in June 1960. Starting in March 1960, the UMHK began to financially support CONAKAT and bribed the party leader, [[Mo\u00efse Tshombe]], into advocating policies that were favorable to the company.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=4}}  \n\nWhen the [[Belgian Congo]] received independence from Belgium on 30 June 1960, it was already wracked by ethnic factionalism and political tension. A coalition of CONAKAT politicians and Belgian settlers had made an attempt shortly before that date to issue their own declaration of independence in Katanga, but the Belgian government opposed their plans. CONAKAT was especially concerned that the emerging Congolese government under prime minister [[Patrice Lumumba]] would dismiss its members from their positions in the Katangese provincial government and replace them with his supporters.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=140}} \n\nOn the evening of 11 July, CONAKAT leader [[Mo\u00efse Tshombe]], accusing the central government of communist leanings and dictatorial rule, announced that Katanga was seceding from the Congo. To assist him, the UMKH gave Tshombe an advance of 1, 250 million Belgian fraces.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=4}} Tshombe's first act was to ask the Belgian Prime Minister, [[Gaston Eyskens]], for help.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=2}}  When the newly appointed commander of the \u00c9lisabethville military garrison arrived in the city, Katangese authorities immediately detained and expelled him. He flew to [[Kananga|Luluabourg]] and informed Lumumba and President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] of the secession. The two decided to fly to Katanga to examine the situation themselves.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=99}} Katangese Minister of Interior Munongo denied them permission to land at the airport and radioed that while Kasa-Vubu could visit Katanga if he wished, Lumumba was not allowed to enter the territory. Infuriated, the President and Prime Minister returned to Luluabourg.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=100}} Tshombe immediately appointed his own commander, a Colonel Norbert Muke of the Force Publique, to form a new military force, the Katanga Gendarmerie.<ref name=Mockler/> The gendarmerie was staffed with Belgian officers who were, in effect, seconded to Tshombe as military advisers.<ref name=Mockler/> On 16 July 1960, Eyskens extended ''de facto'' recognition to Katanga and on 22 July created the ''Mission Technique Belge'' (Mistebe) to assist Katanga with arms and advisers.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=2-3}} \n\nTshombe and CONAKAT argued that the secession was the result of indigenous nationalist sentiment. However, the [[Luba people|Baluba]] population of the northern districts of the province were actively opposed to independence, and even the population in the south, while generally more sympathetic to Tshombe, was never directly consulted on the matter. Katanga was also home to a disproportionately large white community of Belgian descent, as well as many Belgian expatriates who had invested heavily in the province.<ref name=\"lefever1965\">{{cite book |editor1-first=Ernest W. |editor1-last=Lefever |title=Crisis in Congo: A United Nations Force in Action |date=1965 |edition=1st |publisher=Brookings Institution |location=Washington DC |isbn=0-8157-5198-2}}</ref> For the most part, Katanga's white residents openly backed the secession. Unlike Lumumba, Tshombe had openly courted them, likely because he believed they possessed much needed technical skills, and their exodus would prove catastrophic to the Katangese economy.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/>\n\nWithin the Belgian government, King [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin]] was very supportive of Katanga and used all the power of the court to pressure the government into extending diplomatic recognition to Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} The Foreign Minister, [[Pierre Wigny]], knowing that the United States was opposed to breaking up the Congo, was against recognizing Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} Wigny feared a repeat of the Suez crisis of 1956 when Britain, France and Israel were all humiliated when\u00a0the United States opposed their attack on Egypt with the Congo playing the role of Egypt and Belgium the role of the nations that attacked Egypt. For the same reasons, the Belgian representative at NATO, Andr\u00e9 de Staercke, was opposed to a venture that was likely to anger the United States.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} Henri Crene, the Belgian consul in \u00c9lisabethville\u00a0was a fierce supporter of Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} [[Harold Charles d'Aspremont Lynden]], the right-hand man to Eyskens and his most influential adviser was likewise an adamant supporter of Katanga, seeing a chance for Belgium to hold onto the most valuable part of the Congo.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} Between the pressure from his Foreign Minister to not recognize Katanga vs. the pressure from the King to recognize Katanga left Eyskens torn and confused.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} Through unwilling to recognize Katanga out of the fear of the American reaction, the prime minister did accede to pressure from Baudouin and d'Aspremont Lynden to support Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}}  \u00a0\n\nWithin a week of Katanga's unilateral declaration of independence, Lumumba sent a telegram to the Secretary-General of the UN, insisting that something be done about \"Belgium's military aggression\" in his country and its overt backing of Katangese secession.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Lumumba requested \"urgent military assistance\" due to his government's inability to maintain order in the massive country.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Among UN member states, sentiments towards Katanga were generally mixed. [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] remained neutral, the latter quietly hostile towards the very idea of peacekeeping in Congo. The British initially provided general assistance to the UN troops who were eventually dispatched, but refused to cooperate with subsequent efforts to deal with Tshombe's rebellious regime. [[Portugal]] and the [[Union of South Africa]] were openly hostile towards the operation from its conception, and maintained consistent opposition against any interference with the Katanga state.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/>\n\nGerald-Libois writes: '..during the entire month of August, a ..race against the clock took place with the objective of building a more or less efficient Katangese gendarmery before the eventual withdrawal of the Belgian troops. The commander of the new gendarmery, Major Cr\u00e8vecoeur, called for former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]'' who had left the Congo after the July troubles or were in Katanga.'<ref>Gerald-Libois, 'Katanga Secession,' 1966, 114.</ref> The numbers of the new force were originally fixed at 1,500 volunteers from 16 to 21 years of age recruited from 'safe' ethnic groups. Almost all the aircraft of the Force Publique had been transferred to [[Kamina]],{{clarify|date=February 2017}} then requisitioned by Katanga.   \u00a0\n\n===Deployment of United Nations troops===\n{{Campaignbox Conflicts in Congo}}\nOn 14 July 1960, in response to requests by Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba|Lumumba]], the [[UN Security Council]] adopted Resolution 143. This called upon [[Belgium]] to remove its military personnel from the Congo and for the UN to provide 'military assistance' to the Congolese forces to allow them 'to meet fully their tasks'. Lumumba demanded that Belgium remove its troops immediately, threatening to seek help from the [[Soviet Union]] if they did not leave within two days. The UN reacted quickly and established [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC). The first UN troops arrived the next day but there was instant disagreement between Lumumba and the UN over the new force's mandate. Because the Congolese army had been in disarray, Lumumba wanted to use the UN peacekeepers to subdue Katanga by force.<ref name=\"paper\">{{cite web | title = The UN in the Congo | url = http://lugh.incore.ulst.ac.uk/home/publication/occasional/kyle.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050418125629/http://lugh.incore.ulst.ac.uk/home/publication/occasional/kyle.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = April 18, 2005 | publisher = Keith Kyle | access-date = September 12, 2006 }}</ref> Referring to the resolution, Lumumba wrote to UN Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]], \u2018From these texts it is clear that, contrary to your personal interpretation, the UN force may be used to subdue the rebel government of Katanga.\u2019 ONUC refused. To Hammarskj\u00f6ld, the secession of Katanga was an internal Congolese matter and the UN was forbidden to intervene by Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.\n\nDisagreements over what the UN force could and could not do continued throughout its deployment, despite the passage of two further Security Council resolutions. Passed on 22 July, Security Council Resolution 145 affirmed that Congo should be a [[unitary state]] and strengthened the call for Belgium to withdraw its forces. On 9 August, Security Council Resolution 146 mentioned Katanga for the first time, and explicitly allowed UN forces to enter Katanga whilst forbidding their use to 'intervene in or influence the outcome of any internal conflict.'<ref name=\"resolutions60\">{{cite web | title =Security Council Resolutions 1960 | url = https://www.un.org/documents/sc/res/1960/scres60.htm |publisher = United nations| accessdate = September 20, 2006 }}</ref> Unhappy with Eyskens's ambivalent policy, King Baudouin tried to replace him at the beginning of August with [[Paul Van Zeeland]] with a mandate to recognize Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} The King's maneuver failed when the man he designated to serve as Foreign Minister in the new government, Paul-Henri Spaak, declined to take part.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}}\n\nA subject of much controversy was Belgium's involvement with Katanga. Brussels had neither inspired nor engineered [[Moise Tshombe]]'s scheme of Katangese secession, but provided technical, financial, and military aid in order to keep Katanga stable in terms of public order and domestic security. The Belgians went on to advise the ONUC force against unnecessary interventions against the state, as it would only \"risk increasing the confusion.\" At the same time, [[Pierre Wigny]], the Foreign Minister, informed the [[United States]], [[France]], and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that his government was opposed to Tshombe's intrigues and was concerned that long-term separation would compromise Congo's economic vitality.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> The government of Katanga had attached to it 1, 133 Belgian technicians in charge of the civil service, 114 Belgian Army officers and 117 Belgian Army NCOs commanding the ''Force Publique'' and 58 Belgian civil servants in charge of the ministries.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} Between 4-8 August 1960, Pierre Kauch of the National Bank of Belgium visited Katanga on behalf of the Belgian government with the aim of establishing a central bank for Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=6}} Upon his return to Brussels, Kauch reported that Katanga was close to chaos and everything would depend upon the \"watchfulness\" of d'Aspremont Lynden, who had taken charge of relations with Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=7}}   Despite the fact that most of Belgium's military personnel were withdrawn from Katanga in September 1960, over two hundred stayed on, making horizontal career shifts into roles as paid [[mercenaries]] serving with the nation's Gendarmes. As late as 1963, several of these soldiers of fortune were still at large, having shed their military uniforms for civilian dress. Other notable Belgian nationals who stayed on included political advisers and some diplomatic ministers. Upon the arrival of United Nations forces in the Congo, they were opposed to allowing ONUC freedom of movement in Katanga and insisted upon obstructing the peacekeeping effort.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> This view was generally strengthened with President Tshombe himself as time advanced, especially with increasingly vocal demands from [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] that the UN use their military advantage to forcibly remove his regime from power. The Security Council, however, only reaffirmed that the ONUC would not be party to any internal disputes but would enter Katanga to assist with keeping the peace. The first such personnel, largely [[Swedish army|Swedish forces]], entered [[Lubumbashi|\u00c9lisabethville]], the Katangese capital city, on 12 August 1960.\n\nAll of this only frustrated the Congolese government, which, on 27 August, launched a poorly organized, ill-fated, incursion into Katanga with [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] soldiers trucked into the province on a motley assortment of Soviet military vehicles. This incident would only lead to the further deterioration of relations between the two governments; sporadic clashes would continue for the next two years.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> On 8 November, an [[Irish Army]] platoon, sent to repair a bridge in [[Niemba]], was [[Niemba Ambush|ambushed]] and nine of its men killed by [[Baluba]] tribesmen.<ref name = ss>\"Letters from Niemba: Irish troops in the Congo, 1960\", ''History Ireland'', Issue 6 (Nov/Dec 2010), Volume 18.</ref>\n\n===Foreign Relations===\nOn 3 October 1960, Katanga opened up an unrecognized diplomatic mission in New York with the aim of lobbying both for the recognition by the United States and to gain admission to the United Nations.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 212-213</ref> The head of the mission was [[Michel Struelens]], an \"urbane and soft-spoken\" Belgian who had previously been in charge of promoting tourism to Belgian Congo.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 213</ref> As the United States did not have diplomatic relations with Katanga, Struelens traveled to New York from Brussels on a Belgian passport.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 213</ref> The fact that Katanga was represented by a white man from Belgium was often used to attack Katanga as a sham.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 210</ref> Struelens told a journalist that his mission was \"to tell the Katanga story in the Western Hemisphere, based on the belief that Katanga is the only barrier against communist influence in the Congo\".<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 214</ref> \n\nThough the United States refused to recognize Katanga, Struelens was able to persuade much of the American right to support Katanga.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 215</ref> One of Struelens's allies were the ultra-right-wing [[Liberty Lobby]], which in a pamphlet declared:  \"Each new demand, no matter how extreme, has been fulfilled by the groggy demoralized Western nations.

It mostly functioned as a recruitment office for foreign mercenaries, although such activities were illegal in France. A considerable amount of French mercenaries were recruited to fight in Katanga, including [[Roger Faulques]], [[Roger Trinquier]], and [[Edgard Tup\u00ebt-Thom\u00e9]].\n\nIn [[Brussels]], a mission was headed by [[Jacques Masangu]]. Just like the Paris mission, it recruited mercenaries to go fight for the Katangese cause.\n\n===Further conflicts===\n[[File:Stamp Katanga 1961 fair 50c.jpg|right|120px|thumb|A Katangese postage stamp issued in 1961. Although Katanga was not a member of the [[Universal Postal Union]], its stamps were tolerated on international mail.]]\nOnly shortly afterwards, Patrice Lumumba was replaced in a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by [[Joseph Mobutu]]. On 17 January 1961 Mobutu sent Lumumba to [[\u00c9lisabethville]] where he was [[torture]]d and executed shortly after arrival.<ref>Kanza, Thomas. (1979) ''The Rise and Fall of Patrice Lumumba'', Schenkman</ref>\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council]] met in the wake of Lumumba's death in a highly emotional atmosphere charged with anti-colonial feeling and rhetoric. On 21 February 1961, the Council adopted resolution 161, which authorised 'all appropriate measures' to 'prevent the occurrence of [[civil war]] in the Congo, including '... the use of force, if necessary, in the last resort'. This resolution demanded the expulsion from the Congo of all Belgian troops and foreign mercenaries but did not explicitly mandate the UN to conduct offensive operations. However, it was ultimately interpreted by the local UN forces to justify military operations in ending the secession of Katanga. Despite the resolution, during the next six months, the UN undertook no major military operations, concentrating instead on facilitating several rounds of political negotiations. However, many sources on location claimed that UN personnel initiated and maintained a high degree of violence and were both overtly and indirectly responsible for hundreds if not even thousands of civilian deaths.\n\nFrom late 1960 onwards, Katanga was characterised by a series of clashes between pro-Tshombe loyalists and Baluba tribesmen, whose political leaders were nominally allied to Leopoldville and opposed Katangese secession. Smaller battles were fought against ANC units attacking from other provinces, as well.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Sparsely deployed and on many occasions even outgunned by both sides, UN forces had an almost hopeless task of attempting to prevent outright civil war. Anticipating the need for continued ONUC presence in the state, the Security Council authorized an increased presence in \u00c9lisabethville. By mid-1961, however, presidential security forces had killed almost 7,000 Balubas. Factional strife also began to engulf the struggling regime. Increased numbers of peacekeepers only enraged the Baluba people, who viewed the United Nations as an unwanted intruder and began attacking both Katangese and UN soldiers with little discrimination.\n\n===Mercenary warfare===\n[[File:Katangese gendarme.jpg|thumb|Katangese gendarme in 1961.]]\nIn February 1961, attempting to bolster his position in Katanga, Moise Tshombe began importing more foreign mercenaries from neighboring states to assist his Gendarmes. The \"Mercenary Problem\", as the international community termed it, was a major concern of the ONUC. The Katangese Army was already staffed by Belgian officers, and white volunteers of Belgian extraction constituted about 117 men under Tshombe's direction. Although from January to February 1961, gestures were made to remove these 'illegal combatants' from the Congo, their places were quickly taken by a sizable force of nearly 500 British, Rhodesian, French, and South African irregulars. Many of them were given command assignments in the Gendarmes, while others formed a pro-Tshombe unit known as the \"International Company\", composed chiefly of [[white South African]] fighters.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/>\n\nEspecially notable among the French mercenaries were professional career soldiers who had fought in the [[Algerian War]]. Several were the heads of a para commando training program in Katanga. On March 30, one of the first public reports mentioning large contingents of foreign soldiers claimed that the mercenaries in Katanga included \"Belgians, Italians, and 100 South Africans\".<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Serious fighting soon broke out as President Tshombe began to incite both Katangese civilians and white mercenaries to attack UN forces after the ONUC dispatched elements of the nearly 5,000 man-strong [[99th Indian Infantry Brigade]] into the capital. On 5 April 1961, the Secretary-General criticised Belgian mercenaries for their service in Katanga and condemned Tshombe for turning the Katangese public against the United Nations Force. Hostilities broke out again three days later, when Belgian and South African Gendarmes assaulted Kabalo, a Baluba town in northern Katanga, and engaged the Ethiopian peacekeepers stationed there. In the battle that followed, at least 30 mercenaries were disarmed and captured. It was not until 30 April that the State of Katanga agreed to cease hostilities against the ONUC.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/>\n\n===Later developments===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\nIn June, President Tshombe was arrested after attending the Coquilhatville Conference of Congo Leaders, the day he was about to board a plane back to his country. He was held under house arrest and charged with inciting revolt against the Congolese government, the illegal seizure of arms and aircraft, and printing counterfeit money by issuing a Katangese currency. Tshombe subsequently signed a pledge to reunite Katanga with the rest of the nation, and was released accordingly.<ref name=\"TshomeBio\">{{cite web | title =Mo\u00efse Kapenda Tshombe Biography | url = http://www.bookrags.com/biography/moise-kapenda-tshombe/ |publisher = BookRags, Inc. | accessdate = June 29, 2011 }}</ref> However, by August it was clear he had no intention of implementing this agreement. Tshombe openly declared in a speech that month that he would defend Katanga's rights as a sovereign state and would do everything to maintain this status quo even in the face of all opposition.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[File:Swedish troops detain white Katangese sniper.jpg|thumb|Swedish troops detain white Katangese mercenary.]]\nIn August and September, the UN conducted two operations to arrest and repatriate mercenary soldiers and the Belgian political advisers from Katanga by military force, deeming that such foreigners were the backbone behind the regime. The first operation was carried out by Indian UNF troops, who began rounding up mercenaries at 5 am, culminating in the bloodless capture of nearly 400 men. Not a single shot had been fired.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Although Belgium's consul in Katanga was ordered to deport the remaining Belgian nationals, including political advisers, he countered that he could only exercise legal authority over those who were official staff affiliated with his nation's government or military.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAltogether, about 300 of those captured were expelled from Congo, although several of the mercenaries later returned. White Katangese especially resented this action by the UN. Tshombe was taken by surprise, and tensions escalated rapidly. On 11 September, the UNF further demanded that all foreigners serving as police officers in Katanga be expelled, but the president did not comply. Any chances of negotiation for the peaceful removal of remaining foreign players was quickly crushed by the revelation that some UN personnel had been planning to aid in a conspiracy to remove Tshombe from power, seize the radio station in \u00c9lisabethville, and apprehend his Gendarmes. The Katangese quickly unearthed the plot, and when Tshombe confronted the UN with his charges it was revealed, much to the latter's embarrassment, that these allegations were based on fairly solid evidence. If such an incident had been allowed to take place, it would clearly have been considered a violation of the ONUC's vows to remain neutral in internal issues besides taking proper action to prevent a major conflict.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> The following day, hostilities reopened after 155 Irish soldiers protecting civilians in [[Siege of Jadotville|Jadotville were surrounded]] by a superior force of Gendarmes, including many Europeans. Despite suffering several attacks launched by [[Katangese Air Force|Katanga's mercenary-piloted Air Force]] in support of the Gendarme unit, the troopers refused to surrender and during the ensuing fighting inflicted heavy casualties on the attacking forces.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/><ref name=\"war\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873396-1,00.html War in Katanga] ''[[TIME]]'', Sep. 22, 1961</ref> The outnumbered Irish company was eventually forced to surrender. They were held as prisoners of war for approximately one month.\n\nNo longer able to take the increasing violence in Katanga, the ONUC commanders finally agreed to a new plan which would remove the Katangese government from power. It called for UNF troops to apprehend mercenaries, seize post offices and radio stations in \u00c9lisabethville, and send a representative from the central Congolese government to take command. This attempt was not at all bloodless and was resisted by the Gendarmes and their mercenary allies. The initial UN initiative to take over the post offices was efficiently repulsed. Later that day, Katangese soldiers launched a coordinated attack on ONUC forces. An eight-day battle was waged in the city, resulting in the deaths of 11 UN personnel. One company of Irish troops, at [[Siege of Jadotville|Jadotville, were captured]]. Tshombe's army enjoyed unchallenged air power, and the tiny Katangese Air Force carried out successful strafing and bombing runs on UN positions entrenched in Jadotville, \u00c9lisabethville, and Kamina.<ref>[[United States Army]] (1965) ''U.S. Army Area Handbook (Congo-Leopoldville)'', United States Army</ref>\n\n[[File:Katangese gendarme with Swedish ONUC prisoners.jpg|thumb|Katangese gendarme guards with Swedish ONUC soldiers taken prisoner.]]\nThe dismal failure of the UNF could also be attributed to inferior equipment. While the Gendarmes were armed with automatic rifles, heavy machine guns, mortars, and [[M8 Greyhound|Greyhound]] [[Armored car (military)|armored cars]], the vast majority of UN troopers used antiquated rifles and civilian vehicles plated with only makeshift protection. During the fighting, the Katangese authorities offered a conditional ceasefire, which was immediately rejected by the ONUC. Eventually, it became clear that any objective to depose Moise Tshombe had failed. The British, Belgian, and French governments became especially critical of 'peacekeeping operations' in Congo which would involve such interference in domestic affairs.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> They called for an immediate ceasefire. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, protested that more force should have been used to subdue Katanga and initiate an immediate reunification with the Mobutu government.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn the course of the limited peace negotiations which ensued, UN Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]] and 15 others were killed [[1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash|in a plane crash]] near [[Ndola]], [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]), under questionable circumstances.

However, this remained an agreement on paper only. The Katangese government insisted that should the plan in full be honored by Leopoldville, Tshombe be entitled to aid in drafting a new Congolese constitution and elect his own representatives to Parliament. However, both sides began to express reservations about the terms less than a week later. The president wished that his agreement should be ratified by his national assembly before it could be considered binding; this misunderstanding quickly led to a collapse in relations with Congolese government of Prime Minister [[Cyrille Adoula]]. The frustrated United Nations went on to adopt a new plan, one that called for the adoption of a federal constitution in Congo within thirty days, an end to the illegal Katangese rebellion, the unification of currency, and the sharing of mining revenues on a fifty-fifty split between Katanga and the central government.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> U Thant, who was the chief architect of this proposal, also demanded that Tshombe unconditionally release all of his political prisoners. Belgium and the United States, hoping that the latter would have a positive role in reforming a unified Congo, endorsed the plan. While Cyrille Adoula immediately accepted this compromise, Moise Tshombe stipulated conditions. A series of discussions hosted by the UN followed although it failed to yield tangible results. Thant, who had become increasingly incensed by what he regarded as the Katangese state stalling for time, imposed economic sanctions. This, however, only succeeded in destroying the last hopes the Secretary-General had for a peaceful integration. On December 19, an exasperated Tshombe withdrew from ongoing negotiations in protest.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe new administration of John F. Kennedy had decided that the Adoula government represented the best hope of stability in the Congo, all more so as Adoula professed to be a firm anti-Communist.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 216</ref> As Katanga happened to possess most of the Congo's mineral wealth, it was realized that Adoula government could not economically function if Katanga were allowed to secede, causing Kennedy to come down on the side of Congolese unity.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 216</ref> In New York Struelens called a press conference to say: \"When the UN says it has committed no atrocities in Katanga, I distribute pictures of atrocities and so give proof of the bloody mess of the UN in Katanga\".<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 216</ref> In response, the Kennedy administration cancelled Struelens's visa with the intention of expelling him, but backed down after Katanga's friends in Congress raised a media uproar.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 218</ref> To win the propaganda war, Kennedy commissioned the Undersecretary of State [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]] to make a case to the media that Katanga was unworthy of American support.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 218-219</ref> In a speech that was later published as a pamphlet published by the State Department, Ball argued that the majority of the people in Katanga did not support the Tshombe regime and noting the way that Belgian officials had all the real power in Katanga argued that Katanga  like Manchukuo was an artificial state created as a clock for imperialism of others.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 219</ref> \u00a0  \u00a0\n[[File:Hospital bombarded by the UN.jpg|thumb|Red Cross hospital bombarded by UN forces during Operation Unokat, 1962.]]\n\n===Final days===\nAs 1962 drew to a close, the United Nations gradually increased its operational strength in Katanga, with Thant considering ever more seriously the option of forcibly ending Tshombe's secession. As UNF forces continued to be harassed by Gendarmerie, the political stalemate rapidly escalated into outright military tension. When the Katangese populace celebrated the anniversary of their independence, for example, UN officials blocked the roads into \u00c9lisabethville, fearful of the 2,000-strong \"honour guard\" that was scheduled to march in upcoming parades. Several thousand civilian residents promptly demonstrated against this unilateral action.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Two months later, the local authorities impounded several railroad cars bearing equipment and supplies for use in ONUC operations and a number of Gurkha peacekeepers were wounded by unmarked land mines on the Katangese border.\n\nA subsequent report compiled by the [[Brookings Institution]] indicated that the Katangese regime was purchasing new military aircraft and increasing the size of its army, reporting that they now had at their disposal \"40,000 troops and Gendarmerie, at least 400 mercenaries and at least 20 planes.\" These figures were exaggerated.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> The Secretary-General's office responded by increasing trade sanctions, but several member states, the United Kingdom in particular, continued to oppose the use of embargoes to force a political solution.\n\nOn 20 December, the [[United States Department of State|American State Department]] announced it would be sending a US military mission to Katanga, a move that was severely criticised by white and black Katangese alike. At least a hundred local students, many of them European, subsequently protested at the United States consulate. The Congolese government and the Eastern Bloc also voiced their dissent.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> But it soon became apparent that Katanga's bid for international recognition was doomed; skyrocketing pressure for direct action, growing American interests, the militant mood of the UNF commanders, and Belgium's pledge to cease supporting a rebel government all suggested that soon the United Nations would take more forceful measures against Moise Tshombe in the near future.\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 24 December 1962, United Nations forces and Katangese Gendarmes clashed near a UNF observation post near \u00c9lisabethville. A helicopter was subsequently shot down, and President Tshombe expressed regrets over what initially appeared to be a misunderstanding, promising to call off his forces. But by 27 December, the firing on both sides had not ceased; UN officers notified the National Assembly that they would take all necessary action in self-defense unless a ceasefire was observed immediately.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> [[Operation Grandslam|Operation ''Grandslam'']] was launched the following day and peacekeepers marched on \u00c9lisabethville to neutralize the Gendarmes.\n\n[[File:Swedish troops in Kaminaville.jpg|thumb|Swedish troops clear Kaminaville of Katangese resistance, 31 December 1962.]]\nWithin three days, \u00c9lisabethville was under UN control. A number of Gendarmes were either captured or forced to withdraw further west. The foreign mercenaries scattered. Fighter aircraft conducted over seventy sorties against the Katangese Air Force; all but two jets were destroyed on the ground.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Tshombe escaped his capital but threatened to launch a counteroffensive unless the UNF restrained itself and called off its attack. A truce was observed until January 1, but, in a controversial act of defiance, UN personnel explicitly ignored their orders from New York and assaulted [[Jadotville]]. Katangese forces demolished the bridges over the [[Lufira River]] to prevent them from proceeding, but the latter was able to cross using debris, despite light resistance and sporadic sniper fire.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> It was later suggested that this was due to the slow state of communications then plaguing ONUC in Katanga and the Congo at large.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> The subsequent capture of Jadotville prevented Tshombe's loyalists from making a stand there, as had been feared.\n\nAfter the fall of Jadotville, several controversial incidents occurred involving UN forces and innocent civilians. Two Belgian women in a car were killed at a road checkpoint after being fired upon by its Indian guards. There were other civilian casualties, including two more unidentified Europeans, who died as a result of actions taken by the UNF. Following these incidents, U Thant suspended further military operations while Belgian and British officials opened up discussions with Tshombe and attempted to talk him into capitulating. It became clear that he was running desperately short of time. On 11 January, peacekeepers entered [[Sakania]], near the Rhodesian border. The Katangese Gendarmes had already been routed and failed to pose a serious threat. Remaining mercenaries, mostly Frenchmen and South Africans, were unable to provide any effective leadership. They ignored instructions to follow a \"scorched earth\" policy and fled the country by way of [[Angola]].<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/>\n\nOn 15 January, Moise Tshombe conceded defeat and allowed UN officials into [[Kolwezi]] on 21 January, his last stronghold.{{sfn|James|1996|p=193}} Land mines and demolitions were to be removed, and all armed loyalists directed to surrender their weapons. Tshombe reportedly claimed in a final address to his supporters: \"For the last two and a half years you have twice fought heroically against the enemy. Now their superiority has become overwhelming.\"{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=38}}{{sfn|Daniel|Hayes|2016|pp=215\u2013216}}{{sfn|Vaqu\u00e9|1989}}\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe Congolese government took immediate steps to reintegrate Katanga with the rest of the country. Gendarmes were absorbed into the national military, and [[Joseph Ileo]], former Prime Minister, was appointed Resident Minister of the new province. The United Nations provided assistance in reuniting divided economic and administrative divisions. On 29 January, the Secretary-General's office stated that most UN action in the former state would be limited to economics and that a substantially reduced force would be maintained to keep order.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Denmark, Ghana, and the Philippines each pledged to dispatch more personnel. U Thant also called for a slow reduction of military presence, in case a second secession was attempted by fanatics or diehards. Although he defended the use of force taken by ONUC in ousting Tshombe, he also commented regarding the final campaign, \"For a peace force, even a little fighting is too much, and only a few casualties are too many.\"<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/>\n\nIn July 1964, Moise Tshombe returned from exile to become Prime Minister of Congo at the head of a coalition government, succeeding Cyrille Adoula. He was dismissed from his position in October 1965.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [[Front for the National Liberation of the Congo]]\n* [[Siege of Jadotville]]\n* [[South Kasai]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Boehme |first1=Olivier |last2= |first2= |date=2005 |title=The Involvement of the Belgian Central Bank in the Katanga Secession, 1960-1963 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4617603 |journal=African Economic History |volume=33 |issue= |pages=1-29 |doi= |access-date=19 April 2020}}\n* [[Conor Cruise O'Brien|Cruise O'Brien, Conor]] (1962) ''To Katanga and Back'', London, Hutchinson.\n* {{cite book|last1 = Daniel|first1 = Donald C.|last2= Hayes|first2 = Bradd C.|title = Beyond Traditional Peacekeeping|page     = 320|year      = 2016|publisher = [[Springer Publishing|Springer]]|isbn  = 978-1-349-23855-2|url = {{google books|jKO-DAAAQBAJ|plainurl=y}}|ref = harv}}\n* Devlin, L.

The new Katangese state did not enjoy full support throughout the province and was constantly plagued by ethnic strife in its northernmost region. It was dissolved in 1963 following an invasion by [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC) forces, and reintegrated with the rest of the country as [[Katanga Province]].\n\nThe Katangese secession was made with the support of [[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga]], a [[Belgium|Belgian]] mining company, and a large contingent of Belgian military advisers.<ref name=Mockler>{{cite book|last=Mockler|first=Antony|title=The New Mercenaries: The History of the Hired Soldier from the Congo to the Seychelles|date=1987|pages=37\u201355|publisher=Paragon House Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-913729-72-8}}</ref> A paramilitary force designated the [[Katangese Gendarmerie|Katanga Gendarmerie]], raised by the Tshombe government, was initially organised and trained by Belgium and subsequently, mercenaries of various nationalities.<ref>For more on the Gendarmerie, see Jules G\u00e9rard-Libois, 'Katanga Secession,' University of Wisconsin Press, 1966, 114\u2013115, 155\u2013174.</ref>\n\n==Congo Crisis==\n{{main|Congo Crisis}}\n{{further|Katangese Gendarmerie}}\n\n===The initial secession===\n[[File:UMHK 1917.jpg|thumb|A {{lang|fr|[[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut-Katanga]]}} (UMHK) copper mine, pictured in 1917. Katanga's mineral wealth played an important part in the secession.]]\n\nIn 1906, the ''[[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga]]'' (UMHK) company was founded and was granted the exclusive rights to mine copper in Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=2}} The principle shareholders in the ''Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut-Katanga'' were ''Comit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cial de Katanga'', the ''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale'' and the British Tanganyika Concessions Limited.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=2}} In turn, the largest shareholder in the ''Comit\u00e9 Sp\u00e9cial de Katanga'' was the Belgian state.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=2}} As 33.7% of the revenue of the Congo came from the sale of the copper mined in Katanga, ownership of the company was an important consideration for the leaders the Congolese Independence movement while the Belgian government was most reluctant to give up its share in the UMHK, and did not finally do so until 1967.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=2}} In January 1959, it was announced that Beligum would grant independence to the Congo in June 1960. Starting in March 1960, the UMHK began to financially support CONAKAT and bribed the party leader, [[Mo\u00efse Tshombe]], into advocating policies that were favorable to the company.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=4}}  \n\nWhen the [[Belgian Congo]] received independence from Belgium on 30 June 1960, it was already wracked by ethnic factionalism and political tension. A coalition of CONAKAT politicians and Belgian settlers had made an attempt shortly before that date to issue their own declaration of independence in Katanga, but the Belgian government opposed their plans. CONAKAT was especially concerned that the emerging Congolese government under prime minister [[Patrice Lumumba]] would dismiss its members from their positions in the Katangese provincial government and replace them with his supporters.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=140}} \n\nOn the evening of 11 July, CONAKAT leader [[Mo\u00efse Tshombe]], accusing the central government of communist leanings and dictatorial rule, announced that Katanga was seceding from the Congo. To assist him, the UMKH gave Tshombe an advance of 1, 250 million Belgian fraces.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=4}} Tshombe's first act was to ask the Belgian Prime Minister, [[Gaston Eyskens]], for help.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=2}}  When the newly appointed commander of the \u00c9lisabethville military garrison arrived in the city, Katangese authorities immediately detained and expelled him. He flew to [[Kananga|Luluabourg]] and informed Lumumba and President [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] of the secession. The two decided to fly to Katanga to examine the situation themselves.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=99}} Katangese Minister of Interior Munongo denied them permission to land at the airport and radioed that while Kasa-Vubu could visit Katanga if he wished, Lumumba was not allowed to enter the territory. Infuriated, the President and Prime Minister returned to Luluabourg.{{sfn|Hoskyns|1965|p=100}} Tshombe immediately appointed his own commander, a Colonel Norbert Muke of the Force Publique, to form a new military force, the Katanga Gendarmerie.<ref name=Mockler/> The gendarmerie was staffed with Belgian officers who were, in effect, seconded to Tshombe as military advisers.<ref name=Mockler/> On 16 July 1960, Eyskens extended ''de facto'' recognition to Katanga and on 22 July created the ''Mission Technique Belge'' (Mistebe) to assist Katanga with arms and advisers.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=2-3}} \n\nTshombe and CONAKAT argued that the secession was the result of indigenous nationalist sentiment. However, the [[Luba people|Baluba]] population of the northern districts of the province were actively opposed to independence, and even the population in the south, while generally more sympathetic to Tshombe, was never directly consulted on the matter. Katanga was also home to a disproportionately large white community of Belgian descent, as well as many Belgian expatriates who had invested heavily in the province.<ref name=\"lefever1965\">{{cite book |editor1-first=Ernest W. |editor1-last=Lefever |title=Crisis in Congo: A United Nations Force in Action |date=1965 |edition=1st |publisher=Brookings Institution |location=Washington DC |isbn=0-8157-5198-2}}</ref> For the most part, Katanga's white residents openly backed the secession. Unlike Lumumba, Tshombe had openly courted them, likely because he believed they possessed much needed technical skills, and their exodus would prove catastrophic to the Katangese economy.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/>\n\nWithin the Belgian government, King [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin]] was very supportive of Katanga and used all the power of the court to pressure the government into extending diplomatic recognition to Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} The Foreign Minister, [[Pierre Wigny]], knowing that the United States was opposed to breaking up the Congo, was against recognizing Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} Wigny feared a repeat of the Suez crisis of 1956 when Britain, France and Israel were all humiliated when\u00a0the United States opposed their attack on Egypt with the Congo playing the role of Egypt and Belgium the role of the nations that attacked Egypt. For the same reasons, the Belgian representative at NATO, Andr\u00e9 de Staercke, was opposed to a venture that was likely to anger the United States.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} Henri Crene, the Belgian consul in \u00c9lisabethville\u00a0was a fierce supporter of Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} [[Harold Charles d'Aspremont Lynden]], the right-hand man to Eyskens and his most influential adviser was likewise an adamant supporter of Katanga, seeing a chance for Belgium to hold onto the most valuable part of the Congo.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} Between the pressure from his Foreign Minister to not recognize Katanga vs. the pressure from the King to recognize Katanga left Eyskens torn and confused.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} Through unwilling to recognize Katanga out of the fear of the American reaction, the prime minister did accede to pressure from Baudouin and d'Aspremont Lynden to support Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}}  \u00a0\n\nWithin a week of Katanga's unilateral declaration of independence, Lumumba sent a telegram to the Secretary-General of the UN, insisting that something be done about \"Belgium's military aggression\" in his country and its overt backing of Katangese secession.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Lumumba requested \"urgent military assistance\" due to his government's inability to maintain order in the massive country.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Among UN member states, sentiments towards Katanga were generally mixed. [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[France]] remained neutral, the latter quietly hostile towards the very idea of peacekeeping in Congo. The British initially provided general assistance to the UN troops who were eventually dispatched, but refused to cooperate with subsequent efforts to deal with Tshombe's rebellious regime. [[Portugal]] and the [[Union of South Africa]] were openly hostile towards the operation from its conception, and maintained consistent opposition against any interference with the Katanga state.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/>\n\nGerald-Libois writes: '..during the entire month of August, a ..race against the clock took place with the objective of building a more or less efficient Katangese gendarmery before the eventual withdrawal of the Belgian troops. The commander of the new gendarmery, Major Cr\u00e8vecoeur, called for former officers of the ''[[Force Publique]]'' who had left the Congo after the July troubles or were in Katanga.'<ref>Gerald-Libois, 'Katanga Secession,' 1966, 114.</ref> The numbers of the new force were originally fixed at 1,500 volunteers from 16 to 21 years of age recruited from 'safe' ethnic groups. Almost all the aircraft of the Force Publique had been transferred to [[Kamina]],{{clarify|date=February 2017}} then requisitioned by Katanga.   \u00a0\n\n===Deployment of United Nations troops===\n{{Campaignbox Conflicts in Congo}}\nOn 14 July 1960, in response to requests by Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba|Lumumba]], the [[UN Security Council]] adopted Resolution 143. This called upon [[Belgium]] to remove its military personnel from the Congo and for the UN to provide 'military assistance' to the Congolese forces to allow them 'to meet fully their tasks'. Lumumba demanded that Belgium remove its troops immediately, threatening to seek help from the [[Soviet Union]] if they did not leave within two days. The UN reacted quickly and established [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] (ONUC). The first UN troops arrived the next day but there was instant disagreement between Lumumba and the UN over the new force's mandate. Because the Congolese army had been in disarray, Lumumba wanted to use the UN peacekeepers to subdue Katanga by force.<ref name=\"paper\">{{cite web | title = The UN in the Congo | url = http://lugh.incore.ulst.ac.uk/home/publication/occasional/kyle.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050418125629/http://lugh.incore.ulst.ac.uk/home/publication/occasional/kyle.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = April 18, 2005 | publisher = Keith Kyle | access-date = September 12, 2006 }}</ref> Referring to the resolution, Lumumba wrote to UN Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]], \u2018From these texts it is clear that, contrary to your personal interpretation, the UN force may be used to subdue the rebel government of Katanga.\u2019 ONUC refused. To Hammarskj\u00f6ld, the secession of Katanga was an internal Congolese matter and the UN was forbidden to intervene by Article 2 of the United Nations Charter.\n\nDisagreements over what the UN force could and could not do continued throughout its deployment, despite the passage of two further Security Council resolutions. Passed on 22 July, Security Council Resolution 145 affirmed that Congo should be a [[unitary state]] and strengthened the call for Belgium to withdraw its forces. On 9 August, Security Council Resolution 146 mentioned Katanga for the first time, and explicitly allowed UN forces to enter Katanga whilst forbidding their use to 'intervene in or influence the outcome of any internal conflict.'<ref name=\"resolutions60\">{{cite web | title =Security Council Resolutions 1960 | url = https://www.un.org/documents/sc/res/1960/scres60.htm |publisher = United nations| accessdate = September 20, 2006 }}</ref> Unhappy with Eyskens's ambivalent policy, King Baudouin tried to replace him at the beginning of August with [[Paul Van Zeeland]] with a mandate to recognize Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} The King's maneuver failed when the man he designated to serve as Foreign Minister in the new government, Paul-Henri Spaak, declined to take part.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}}\n\nA subject of much controversy was Belgium's involvement with Katanga. Brussels had neither inspired nor engineered [[Moise Tshombe]]'s scheme of Katangese secession, but provided technical, financial, and military aid in order to keep Katanga stable in terms of public order and domestic security. The Belgians went on to advise the ONUC force against unnecessary interventions against the state, as it would only \"risk increasing the confusion.\" At the same time, [[Pierre Wigny]], the Foreign Minister, informed the [[United States]], [[France]], and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] that his government was opposed to Tshombe's intrigues and was concerned that long-term separation would compromise Congo's economic vitality.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> The government of Katanga had attached to it 1, 133 Belgian technicians in charge of the civil service, 114 Belgian Army officers and 117 Belgian Army NCOs commanding the ''Force Publique'' and 58 Belgian civil servants in charge of the ministries.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=3}} Between 4-8 August 1960, Pierre Kauch of the National Bank of Belgium visited Katanga on behalf of the Belgian government with the aim of establishing a central bank for Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=6}} Upon his return to Brussels, Kauch reported that Katanga was close to chaos and everything would depend upon the \"watchfulness\" of d'Aspremont Lynden, who had taken charge of relations with Katanga.{{sfn|Boehme|2005|=7}}   Despite the fact that most of Belgium's military personnel were withdrawn from Katanga in September 1960, over two hundred stayed on, making horizontal career shifts into roles as paid [[mercenaries]] serving with the nation's Gendarmes. As late as 1963, several of these soldiers of fortune were still at large, having shed their military uniforms for civilian dress. Other notable Belgian nationals who stayed on included political advisers and some diplomatic ministers. Upon the arrival of United Nations forces in the Congo, they were opposed to allowing ONUC freedom of movement in Katanga and insisted upon obstructing the peacekeeping effort.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> This view was generally strengthened with President Tshombe himself as time advanced, especially with increasingly vocal demands from [[Kinshasa|L\u00e9opoldville]] that the UN use their military advantage to forcibly remove his regime from power. The Security Council, however, only reaffirmed that the ONUC would not be party to any internal disputes but would enter Katanga to assist with keeping the peace. The first such personnel, largely [[Swedish army|Swedish forces]], entered [[Lubumbashi|\u00c9lisabethville]], the Katangese capital city, on 12 August 1960.\n\nAll of this only frustrated the Congolese government, which, on 27 August, launched a poorly organized, ill-fated, incursion into Katanga with [[Arm\u00e9e Nationale Congolaise]] soldiers trucked into the province on a motley assortment of Soviet military vehicles. This incident would only lead to the further deterioration of relations between the two governments; sporadic clashes would continue for the next two years.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> On 8 November, an [[Irish Army]] platoon, sent to repair a bridge in [[Niemba]], was [[Niemba Ambush|ambushed]] and nine of its men killed by [[Baluba]] tribesmen.<ref name = ss>\"Letters from Niemba: Irish troops in the Congo, 1960\", ''History Ireland'', Issue 6 (Nov/Dec 2010), Volume 18.</ref>\n\n===Foreign Relations===\nOn 3 October 1960, Katanga opened up an unrecognized diplomatic mission in New York with the aim of lobbying both for the recognition by the United States and to gain admission to the United Nations.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 212-213</ref> The head of the mission was Michel Struelens, an \"urbane and soft-spoken\" Belgian who had previously been in charge of promoting tourism to Belgian Congo.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 213</ref> As the United States did not have diplomatic relations with Katanga, Struelens traveled to New York from Brussels on a Belgian passport.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 213</ref> The fact that Katanga was represented by a white man from Belgium was often used to attack Katanga as a sham.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 210</ref> Struelens told a journalist that his mission was \"to tell the Katanga story in the Western Hemisphere, based on the belief that Katanga is the only barrier against communist influence in the Congo\".<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 214</ref> \n\nThough the United States refused to recognize Katanga, Struelens was able to persuade much of the American right to support Katanga.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 215</ref> One of Struelens's allies were the ultra-right-wing [[Liberty Lobby]], which in a pamphlet declared:  \"Each new demand, no matter how extreme, has been fulfilled by the groggy demoralized Western nations.

It mostly functioned as a recruitment office for foreign mercenaries, although such activities were illegal in France. A considerable amount of French mercenaries were recruited to fight in Katanga, including [[Roger Faulques]], [[Roger Trinquier]], and [[Edgard Tup\u00ebt-Thom\u00e9]].\n\nIn [[Brussels]], a mission was headed by [[Jacques Masangu]]. Just like the Paris mission, it recruited mercenaries to go fight for the Katangese cause.\n\n===Further conflicts===\n[[File:Stamp Katanga 1961 fair 50c.jpg|right|120px|thumb|A Katangese postage stamp issued in 1961. Although Katanga was not a member of the [[Universal Postal Union]], its stamps were tolerated on international mail.]]\nOnly shortly afterwards, Patrice Lumumba was replaced in a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by [[Joseph Mobutu]]. On 17 January 1961 Mobutu sent Lumumba to [[\u00c9lisabethville]] where he was [[torture]]d and executed shortly after arrival.<ref>Kanza, Thomas. (1979) ''The Rise and Fall of Patrice Lumumba'', Schenkman</ref>\n\nThe [[United Nations Security Council]] met in the wake of Lumumba's death in a highly emotional atmosphere charged with anti-colonial feeling and rhetoric. On 21 February 1961, the Council adopted resolution 161, which authorised 'all appropriate measures' to 'prevent the occurrence of [[civil war]] in the Congo, including '... the use of force, if necessary, in the last resort'. This resolution demanded the expulsion from the Congo of all Belgian troops and foreign mercenaries but did not explicitly mandate the UN to conduct offensive operations. However, it was ultimately interpreted by the local UN forces to justify military operations in ending the secession of Katanga. Despite the resolution, during the next six months, the UN undertook no major military operations, concentrating instead on facilitating several rounds of political negotiations. However, many sources on location claimed that UN personnel initiated and maintained a high degree of violence and were both overtly and indirectly responsible for hundreds if not even thousands of civilian deaths.\n\nFrom late 1960 onwards, Katanga was characterised by a series of clashes between pro-Tshombe loyalists and Baluba tribesmen, whose political leaders were nominally allied to Leopoldville and opposed Katangese secession. Smaller battles were fought against ANC units attacking from other provinces, as well.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Sparsely deployed and on many occasions even outgunned by both sides, UN forces had an almost hopeless task of attempting to prevent outright civil war. Anticipating the need for continued ONUC presence in the state, the Security Council authorized an increased presence in \u00c9lisabethville. By mid-1961, however, presidential security forces had killed almost 7,000 Balubas. Factional strife also began to engulf the struggling regime. Increased numbers of peacekeepers only enraged the Baluba people, who viewed the United Nations as an unwanted intruder and began attacking both Katangese and UN soldiers with little discrimination.\n\n===Mercenary warfare===\n[[File:Katangese gendarme.jpg|thumb|Katangese gendarme in 1961.]]\nIn February 1961, attempting to bolster his position in Katanga, Moise Tshombe began importing more foreign mercenaries from neighboring states to assist his Gendarmes. The \"Mercenary Problem\", as the international community termed it, was a major concern of the ONUC. The Katangese Army was already staffed by Belgian officers, and white volunteers of Belgian extraction constituted about 117 men under Tshombe's direction. Although from January to February 1961, gestures were made to remove these 'illegal combatants' from the Congo, their places were quickly taken by a sizable force of nearly 500 British, Rhodesian, French, and South African irregulars. Many of them were given command assignments in the Gendarmes, while others formed a pro-Tshombe unit known as the \"International Company\", composed chiefly of [[white South African]] fighters.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/>\n\nEspecially notable among the French mercenaries were professional career soldiers who had fought in the [[Algerian War]]. Several were the heads of a para commando training program in Katanga. On March 30, one of the first public reports mentioning large contingents of foreign soldiers claimed that the mercenaries in Katanga included \"Belgians, Italians, and 100 South Africans\".<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Serious fighting soon broke out as President Tshombe began to incite both Katangese civilians and white mercenaries to attack UN forces after the ONUC dispatched elements of the nearly 5,000 man-strong [[99th Indian Infantry Brigade]] into the capital. On 5 April 1961, the Secretary-General criticised Belgian mercenaries for their service in Katanga and condemned Tshombe for turning the Katangese public against the United Nations Force. Hostilities broke out again three days later, when Belgian and South African Gendarmes assaulted Kabalo, a Baluba town in northern Katanga, and engaged the Ethiopian peacekeepers stationed there. In the battle that followed, at least 30 mercenaries were disarmed and captured. It was not until 30 April that the State of Katanga agreed to cease hostilities against the ONUC.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/>\n\n===Later developments===\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\nIn June, President Tshombe was arrested after attending the Coquilhatville Conference of Congo Leaders, the day he was about to board a plane back to his country. He was held under house arrest and charged with inciting revolt against the Congolese government, the illegal seizure of arms and aircraft, and printing counterfeit money by issuing a Katangese currency. Tshombe subsequently signed a pledge to reunite Katanga with the rest of the nation, and was released accordingly.<ref name=\"TshomeBio\">{{cite web | title =Mo\u00efse Kapenda Tshombe Biography | url = http://www.bookrags.com/biography/moise-kapenda-tshombe/ |publisher = BookRags, Inc. | accessdate = June 29, 2011 }}</ref> However, by August it was clear he had no intention of implementing this agreement. Tshombe openly declared in a speech that month that he would defend Katanga's rights as a sovereign state and would do everything to maintain this status quo even in the face of all opposition.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\n[[File:Swedish troops detain white Katangese sniper.jpg|thumb|Swedish troops detain white Katangese mercenary.]]\nIn August and September, the UN conducted two operations to arrest and repatriate mercenary soldiers and the Belgian political advisers from Katanga by military force, deeming that such foreigners were the backbone behind the regime. The first operation was carried out by Indian UNF troops, who began rounding up mercenaries at 5 am, culminating in the bloodless capture of nearly 400 men. Not a single shot had been fired.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Although Belgium's consul in Katanga was ordered to deport the remaining Belgian nationals, including political advisers, he countered that he could only exercise legal authority over those who were official staff affiliated with his nation's government or military.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nAltogether, about 300 of those captured were expelled from Congo, although several of the mercenaries later returned. White Katangese especially resented this action by the UN. Tshombe was taken by surprise, and tensions escalated rapidly. On 11 September, the UNF further demanded that all foreigners serving as police officers in Katanga be expelled, but the president did not comply. Any chances of negotiation for the peaceful removal of remaining foreign players was quickly crushed by the revelation that some UN personnel had been planning to aid in a conspiracy to remove Tshombe from power, seize the radio station in \u00c9lisabethville, and apprehend his Gendarmes. The Katangese quickly unearthed the plot, and when Tshombe confronted the UN with his charges it was revealed, much to the latter's embarrassment, that these allegations were based on fairly solid evidence. If such an incident had been allowed to take place, it would clearly have been considered a violation of the ONUC's vows to remain neutral in internal issues besides taking proper action to prevent a major conflict.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> The following day, hostilities reopened after 155 Irish soldiers protecting civilians in [[Siege of Jadotville|Jadotville were surrounded]] by a superior force of Gendarmes, including many Europeans. Despite suffering several attacks launched by [[Katangese Air Force|Katanga's mercenary-piloted Air Force]] in support of the Gendarme unit, the troopers refused to surrender and during the ensuing fighting inflicted heavy casualties on the attacking forces.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/><ref name=\"war\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873396-1,00.html War in Katanga] ''[[TIME]]'', Sep. 22, 1961</ref> The outnumbered Irish company was eventually forced to surrender. They were held as prisoners of war for approximately one month.\n\nNo longer able to take the increasing violence in Katanga, the ONUC commanders finally agreed to a new plan which would remove the Katangese government from power. It called for UNF troops to apprehend mercenaries, seize post offices and radio stations in \u00c9lisabethville, and send a representative from the central Congolese government to take command. This attempt was not at all bloodless and was resisted by the Gendarmes and their mercenary allies. The initial UN initiative to take over the post offices was efficiently repulsed. Later that day, Katangese soldiers launched a coordinated attack on ONUC forces. An eight-day battle was waged in the city, resulting in the deaths of 11 UN personnel. One company of Irish troops, at [[Siege of Jadotville|Jadotville, were captured]]. Tshombe's army enjoyed unchallenged air power, and the tiny Katangese Air Force carried out successful strafing and bombing runs on UN positions entrenched in Jadotville, \u00c9lisabethville, and Kamina.<ref>[[United States Army]] (1965) ''U.S. Army Area Handbook (Congo-Leopoldville)'', United States Army</ref>\n\n[[File:Katangese gendarme with Swedish ONUC prisoners.jpg|thumb|Katangese gendarme guards with Swedish ONUC soldiers taken prisoner.]]\nThe dismal failure of the UNF could also be attributed to inferior equipment. While the Gendarmes were armed with automatic rifles, heavy machine guns, mortars, and [[M8 Greyhound|Greyhound]] [[Armored car (military)|armored cars]], the vast majority of UN troopers used antiquated rifles and civilian vehicles plated with only makeshift protection. During the fighting, the Katangese authorities offered a conditional ceasefire, which was immediately rejected by the ONUC. Eventually, it became clear that any objective to depose Moise Tshombe had failed. The British, Belgian, and French governments became especially critical of 'peacekeeping operations' in Congo which would involve such interference in domestic affairs.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> They called for an immediate ceasefire. The Soviet Union, on the other hand, protested that more force should have been used to subdue Katanga and initiate an immediate reunification with the Mobutu government.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nIn the course of the limited peace negotiations which ensued, UN Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld]] and 15 others were killed [[1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash|in a plane crash]] near [[Ndola]], [[Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]), under questionable circumstances.

However, this remained an agreement on paper only. The Katangese government insisted that should the plan in full be honored by Leopoldville, Tshombe be entitled to aid in drafting a new Congolese constitution and elect his own representatives to Parliament. However, both sides began to express reservations about the terms less than a week later. The president wished that his agreement should be ratified by his national assembly before it could be considered binding; this misunderstanding quickly led to a collapse in relations with Congolese government of Prime Minister [[Cyrille Adoula]]. The frustrated United Nations went on to adopt a new plan, one that called for the adoption of a federal constitution in Congo within thirty days, an end to the illegal Katangese rebellion, the unification of currency, and the sharing of mining revenues on a fifty-fifty split between Katanga and the central government.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> U Thant, who was the chief architect of this proposal, also demanded that Tshombe unconditionally release all of his political prisoners. Belgium and the United States, hoping that the latter would have a positive role in reforming a unified Congo, endorsed the plan. While Cyrille Adoula immediately accepted this compromise, Moise Tshombe stipulated conditions. A series of discussions hosted by the UN followed although it failed to yield tangible results. Thant, who had become increasingly incensed by what he regarded as the Katangese state stalling for time, imposed economic sanctions. This, however, only succeeded in destroying the last hopes the Secretary-General had for a peaceful integration. On December 19, an exasperated Tshombe withdrew from ongoing negotiations in protest.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe new administration of John F. Kennedy had decided that the Adoula government represented the best hope of stability in the Congo, all more so as Adoula professed to be a firm anti-Communist.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 216</ref> As Katanga happened to possess most of the Congo's mineral wealth, it was realized that Adoula government could not economically function if Katanga were allowed to secede, causing Kennedy to come down on the side of Congolese unity.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 216</ref> In New York Struelens called a press conference to say: \"When the UN says it has committed no atrocities in Katanga, I distribute pictures of atrocities and so give proof of the bloody mess of the UN in Katanga\".<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 216</ref> In response, the Kennedy administration cancelled Struelens's visa with the intention of expelling him, but backed down after Katanga's friends in Congress raised a media uproar.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 218</ref> To win the propaganda war, Kennedy commissioned the Undersecretary of State [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]] to make a case to the media that Katanga was unworthy of American support.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 218-219</ref> In a speech that was later published as a pamphlet published by the State Department, Ball argued that the majority of the people in Katanga did not support the Tshombe regime and noting the way that Belgian officials had all the real power in Katanga argued that Katanga  like Manchukuo was an artificial state created as a clock for imperialism of others.<ref>Brownell, Josiah \"Diplomatic Lepers:  The Katangan and Rhodesian Foreign Missions in the United States and the Politics of Nonrecognition\", ''The International Journal of African Historical Studies'', Issue 2 (Spring 2014) Volume 47 p. 219</ref> \u00a0  \u00a0\n[[File:Hospital bombarded by the UN.jpg|thumb|Red Cross hospital bombarded by UN forces during Operation Unokat, 1962.]]\n\n===Final days===\nAs 1962 drew to a close, the United Nations gradually increased its operational strength in Katanga, with Thant considering ever more seriously the option of forcibly ending Tshombe's secession. As UNF forces continued to be harassed by Gendarmerie, the political stalemate rapidly escalated into outright military tension. When the Katangese populace celebrated the anniversary of their independence, for example, UN officials blocked the roads into \u00c9lisabethville, fearful of the 2,000-strong \"honour guard\" that was scheduled to march in upcoming parades. Several thousand civilian residents promptly demonstrated against this unilateral action.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Two months later, the local authorities impounded several railroad cars bearing equipment and supplies for use in ONUC operations and a number of Gurkha peacekeepers were wounded by unmarked land mines on the Katangese border.\n\nA subsequent report compiled by the [[Brookings Institution]] indicated that the Katangese regime was purchasing new military aircraft and increasing the size of its army, reporting that they now had at their disposal \"40,000 troops and Gendarmerie, at least 400 mercenaries and at least 20 planes.\" These figures were exaggerated.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> The Secretary-General's office responded by increasing trade sanctions, but several member states, the United Kingdom in particular, continued to oppose the use of embargoes to force a political solution.\n\nOn 20 December, the [[United States Department of State|American State Department]] announced it would be sending a US military mission to Katanga, a move that was severely criticised by white and black Katangese alike. At least a hundred local students, many of them European, subsequently protested at the United States consulate. The Congolese government and the Eastern Bloc also voiced their dissent.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> But it soon became apparent that Katanga's bid for international recognition was doomed; skyrocketing pressure for direct action, growing American interests, the militant mood of the UNF commanders, and Belgium's pledge to cease supporting a rebel government all suggested that soon the United Nations would take more forceful measures against Moise Tshombe in the near future.\n\n===Surrender===\nOn 24 December 1962, United Nations forces and Katangese Gendarmes clashed near a UNF observation post near \u00c9lisabethville. A helicopter was subsequently shot down, and President Tshombe expressed regrets over what initially appeared to be a misunderstanding, promising to call off his forces. But by 27 December, the firing on both sides had not ceased; UN officers notified the National Assembly that they would take all necessary action in self-defense unless a ceasefire was observed immediately.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> [[Operation Grandslam|Operation ''Grandslam'']] was launched the following day and peacekeepers marched on \u00c9lisabethville to neutralize the Gendarmes.\n\n[[File:Swedish troops in Kaminaville.jpg|thumb|Swedish troops clear Kaminaville of Katangese resistance, 31 December 1962.]]\nWithin three days, \u00c9lisabethville was under UN control. A number of Gendarmes were either captured or forced to withdraw further west. The foreign mercenaries scattered. Fighter aircraft conducted over seventy sorties against the Katangese Air Force; all but two jets were destroyed on the ground.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Tshombe escaped his capital but threatened to launch a counteroffensive unless the UNF restrained itself and called off its attack. A truce was observed until January 1, but, in a controversial act of defiance, UN personnel explicitly ignored their orders from New York and assaulted [[Jadotville]]. Katangese forces demolished the bridges over the [[Lufira River]] to prevent them from proceeding, but the latter was able to cross using debris, despite light resistance and sporadic sniper fire.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> It was later suggested that this was due to the slow state of communications then plaguing ONUC in Katanga and the Congo at large.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> The subsequent capture of Jadotville prevented Tshombe's loyalists from making a stand there, as had been feared.\n\nAfter the fall of Jadotville, several controversial incidents occurred involving UN forces and innocent civilians. Two Belgian women in a car were killed at a road checkpoint after being fired upon by its Indian guards. There were other civilian casualties, including two more unidentified Europeans, who died as a result of actions taken by the UNF. Following these incidents, U Thant suspended further military operations while Belgian and British officials opened up discussions with Tshombe and attempted to talk him into capitulating. It became clear that he was running desperately short of time. On 11 January, peacekeepers entered [[Sakania]], near the Rhodesian border. The Katangese Gendarmes had already been routed and failed to pose a serious threat. Remaining mercenaries, mostly Frenchmen and South Africans, were unable to provide any effective leadership. They ignored instructions to follow a \"scorched earth\" policy and fled the country by way of [[Angola]].<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/>\n\nOn 15 January, Moise Tshombe conceded defeat and allowed UN officials into [[Kolwezi]] on 21 January, his last stronghold.{{sfn|James|1996|p=193}} Land mines and demolitions were to be removed, and all armed loyalists directed to surrender their weapons. Tshombe reportedly claimed in a final address to his supporters: \"For the last two and a half years you have twice fought heroically against the enemy. Now their superiority has become overwhelming.\"{{sfn|Mockaitis|1999|p=38}}{{sfn|Daniel|Hayes|2016|pp=215\u2013216}}{{sfn|Vaqu\u00e9|1989}}\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe Congolese government took immediate steps to reintegrate Katanga with the rest of the country. Gendarmes were absorbed into the national military, and [[Joseph Ileo]], former Prime Minister, was appointed Resident Minister of the new province. The United Nations provided assistance in reuniting divided economic and administrative divisions. On 29 January, the Secretary-General's office stated that most UN action in the former state would be limited to economics and that a substantially reduced force would be maintained to keep order.<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/> Denmark, Ghana, and the Philippines each pledged to dispatch more personnel. U Thant also called for a slow reduction of military presence, in case a second secession was attempted by fanatics or diehards. Although he defended the use of force taken by ONUC in ousting Tshombe, he also commented regarding the final campaign, \"For a peace force, even a little fighting is too much, and only a few casualties are too many.\"<ref name=\"lefever1965\"/>\n\nIn July 1964, Moise Tshombe returned from exile to become Prime Minister of Congo at the head of a coalition government, succeeding Cyrille Adoula. He was dismissed from his position in October 1965.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Commons category}}\n* [[Front for the National Liberation of the Congo]]\n* [[Siege of Jadotville]]\n* [[South Kasai]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal |last1=Boehme |first1=Olivier |last2= |first2= |date=2005 |title=The Involvement of the Belgian Central Bank in the Katanga Secession, 1960-1963 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4617603 |journal=African Economic History |volume=33 |issue= |pages=1-29 |doi= |access-date=19 April 2020}}\n* [[Conor Cruise O'Brien|Cruise O'Brien, Conor]] (1962) ''To Katanga and Back'', London, Hutchinson.\n* {{cite book|last1 = Daniel|first1 = Donald C.|last2= Hayes|first2 = Bradd C.|title = Beyond Traditional Peacekeeping|page     = 320|year      = 2016|publisher = [[Springer Publishing|Springer]]|isbn  = 978-1-349-23855-2|url = {{google books|jKO-DAAAQBAJ|plainurl=y}}|ref = harv}}\n* Devlin, L.
