He is the bassist of [[post-hardcore]] band [[Quicksand (band)|Quicksand]], which originated in New York City in 1990. In 1995, Quicksand disbanded, although they reunited again in 1997 to tour with [[Deftones]]. After this tour, the band desired to write a follow-up to their second album ''[[Manic Compression (album)|Manic Compression]]'', although tensions between bandmates caused the band to split up again, until June 2012 when another reunion was announced. Vega began playing for [[Deftones]], replacing [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] after Cheng was involved in a car accident which caused him to enter a semi-conscious state in November 2008 and led to his eventual death on April 13, 2013. He has appeared on three albums with Deftones: ''[[Diamond Eyes]]'' (2010), ''[[Koi No Yokan]]'' (2012) and ''[[Gore (album)|Gore]]'' (2016).\n\n==Biography==\nIn 1988 he became the bass player for a New York hardcore band Collapse which released a demo and contributed a track on the 1988 New Breed cassette compilation released by Freddy Alva of Wardance records. In 1989 Sergio Vega replaces Alan Peters (ex-Agnostic Front bassist) in the New York hardcore band Absolution... In 1990, Sergio Vega was instrumental in forming the new post-hardcore band Quicksand; at the time Vega was a prominent bassist of the [[genre]]. Quicksand released their debut album, ''[[Slip (album)|Slip]]'', on February 9, 1993. On January 1, 1995, Quicksand released their second album, ''Manic Compression''. Later that year, Quicksand disbanded, and Sergio Vega began to DJ around New York City and Japan. The band reunited briefly in 1997 and toured with Deftones the next year. After this tour, the band desired to write a followup to ''Manic Compression'', although tensions between bandmates caused the band to split up permanently. In 1999, when Deftones bassist [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] was unable to perform onstage during a Deftones tour due to a toe surgery, Vega filled in for him on bass.<ref>{{cite web| title = Deftones Bassist Drops Out of Sabbath Tour| work = [[MTV]] | date = January 27, 1999| url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1426008/19990127/black_sabbath.jhtml| accessdate = April 15, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his career with Quicksand and Deftones, Vega has released solo material.

Vega played in Chi's place at [[Bamboozle Left#2009|Bamboozle Left]] with Deftones, and continued to fill in for him as Cheng's condition remained the same. When his accident occurred, Deftones had just finished writing and recording songs for what was to be their sixth studio-album, ''[[Eros (Deftones album)|Eros]]'', although they decided to shelve the album indefinitely. This decision was made due to Cheng's condition, and also was a creative decision, as the band stated that they didn't feel that ''Eros'' \"best encompassed who they were currently as people or as musicians\". Deftones began writing a new album from scratch in June 2009 with Vega on bass. The album, titled ''[[Diamond Eyes]]'', was released on May 4, 2010. In November 2012 the group released their second album with Vega, named ''[[Koi No Yokan]]''. According to Deftones frontman [[Chino Moreno]], Vega made a bigger contribution to ''Koi No Yokan'' than he did to ''Diamond Eyes''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gary Graff|title=Deftones Racing Through Next Album, Hoping for October Release| work=[[Billboard.com]]|date=July 2, 2012|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/482268/deftones-racing-through-next-album-hoping-for-october-release|accessdate= September 19, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2012, Sergio and Quicksand would secretly reunite to play a surprise set at Revelation Records' 25th anniversary show. This performance was followed by an appearance on the Jimmy Fallon Show as well as two sold out headlining shows at The Bowery Ballroom and The Music Hall of Williamsburg in August 2012. Quicksand would later act as one of the headliners at California's FYF set. In January 2013, Quicksand embarked on their first tour since the late 1990s.

For his first two albums after joining Deftones, Vega used [[Fender Jaguar Bass]]es exclusively (tuned CGCF, C#G#C#F#, Drop D, or standard E, depending on the song). For his third album with the band, ''[[Gore (album)|Gore]]'', Vega used a [[Fender Bass VI]] on several tracks such as \"Hearts/Wires\".

After the [[Third Partition of Poland]] in 1795, it became a Kingdom under Habsburg rule. In 1804 it became a crownland of the [[Austrian Empire]]. From 1867 it was a [[Poles|Polish]]-administered autonomous crownland under [[Cisleithania|Cisleithanian]] [[Austria-Hungary]], until its dissolution in 1918. The country was carved from the entire south-western part of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Among the many ceremonial titles of the princes of Hungary was \"ruler of Galicia and Lodomeria\". Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Austrian Empire ceded portions of Galicia to the [[Russian Empire]], [[West Galicia]] and Tarnopol District.\n\nThe name \"Galicia\" is the Latinized form of [[Principality of Halych|Halych]], a principality of the medieval [[Ruthenia]]. \"[[Lodomeria]]\", is also a [[Latinized name|Latinized form]] of [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]] that was founded in the 10th century by [[Vladimir the Great]] and until the [[partitions of Poland]] was known simply as Volodymyr ({{lang-pl|W\u0142odzimierz}}). King of Galicia and Lodomeria was a medieval title which the King of Hungary ([[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]]) adopted during his conquest of the region in the 12th century.\n\nThis historical region in [[Eastern Europe]] is divided today between [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]]. The nucleus of historic [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] consists of the modern [[Lviv Oblast|Lviv]], [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]], and [[Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast|Ivano-Frankivsk]] regions of [[western Ukraine]].\n\n==Ceremonial name==\nThe name of the Kingdom in its ceremonial form, in {{lang-en|Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria and the Grand Duchy of Krak\u00f3w with the Duchies of Auschwitz and Zator}}, existed in all languages spoken there including {{lang-de|K\u00f6nigreich Galizien und Lodomerien mit dem Gro\u00dfherzogtum Krakau und den Herzogt\u00fcmern Auschwitz und Zator}}; {{lang-pl|Kr\u00f3lestwo Galicji i Lodomerii wraz z Wielkim Ksi\u0119stwem Krakowskim i Ksi\u0119stwem O\u015bwi\u0119cimia i Zatoru}}; {{lang-uk|\u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e \u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0442\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0456\u0457 \u0437 \u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438\u043c \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u0456\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u043c \u041a\u0440\u0430\u043a\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0456 \u043a\u043d\u044f\u0437\u0456\u0432\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\u043c\u0438 \u041e\u0441\u0432\u0435\u043d\u0446\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0456 \u0417\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0443}}, transliterated: ''Korolivstvo Halychyny i Lodomeri\u00ef z velykym knyazivstvom Krakivskym i knyazivstvamy Osventsyma i Zatoru'', and {{lang-hu|Gal\u00edcia \u00e9s Lodom\u00e9ria kir\u00e1lys\u00e1ga Krakk\u00f3 nagyhercegs\u00e9g\u00e9vel \u00e9s Auschwitz \u00e9s Zator hercegs\u00e9ggel}}.\n\n===Other names===\n* Galician Ruthenia ({{lang-ru|\u0413\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c}}, Galitskaya Rus),<ref>Grot, K.

As such, the [[Austria]]n region of [[Poland]] and what was later to become [[Ukraine]] was known as the Kingdom of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Lodomeria]] to underline the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] claims to the country. However, after the [[Third Partition of Poland]], a large portion of the ethnically Polish lands to the west ([[West Galicia|New or West Galicia]]) was also added to the province, which changed the geographical reference of the term ''Galicia''. Lviv ([[Lemberg]]) served as capital of Austrian Galicia, which was dominated by the Polish aristocracy, despite the fact that the population of the eastern half of the province was mostly [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], or \"[[Ruthenia]]n\", as they were known at the time. In addition to the Polish aristocracy and gentry who inhabited almost all parts of Galicia, and the Ruthenians in the east, there existed a large Jewish population, also more heavily concentrated in the eastern parts of the province.\n\nDuring the first decades of Austrian rule, Galicia was firmly governed from [[Vienna]], and many significant reforms were carried out by a bureaucracy staffed largely by Germans and Czechs. The aristocracy was guaranteed its rights, but these rights were considerably circumscribed. The former serfs were no longer mere chattel, but became subjects of law and were granted certain personal freedoms, such as the right to marry without the lord's permission. Their labour obligations were defined and limited, and they could bypass the lords and appeal to the imperial courts for justice. The Eastern Rite \"Uniate\" Church, which primarily served the Ruthenians, was renamed the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic Church]] to bring it onto a par with the Roman Catholic Church; it was given seminaries, and eventually, a Metropolitan. Although unpopular with the aristocracy, among the common folk, Polish and Ukrainian/Ruthenian alike, these reforms created a reservoir of good will toward the emperor which lasted almost to the end of Austrian rule. At the same time, however, the Austrian Empire extracted from Galicia considerable wealth{{Citation needed|reason=Significant transfer payments(less taxes raised compared to expendature) in the Kingdom. -Page 160.

The large city of [[Krak\u00f3w]] and surrounding territory, formerly also part of New or West Galicia, became the semi-autonomous [[Free City of Krak\u00f3w]] unter supervision of the three powers sharing rule over Poland (i. e., Austria, Russia and Prussia).\n[[File:Map of the Kingdom of Galicia, 1914.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Physical map of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, 1849\u20131918]]\n\nThe 1820s and 1830s were a period of bureaucratic rule overseen from Vienna. Most administrative positions were filled by German-speakers, including German-speaking Czechs, although some of their children were already becoming Polonized. After the failure of the November insurrection in Russian Poland in 1830\u201331, in which a few thousand Galician volunteers participated, many Polish refugees arrived in Galicia. The latter 1830s were rife with Polish conspiratorial organizations whose work culminated in the [[Krak\u00f3w Uprising|unsuccessful Galician insurrection of 1846]], which was easily put down by the Austrians with the help of a Galician peasantry that remained loyal to the emperor. The insurrection occurred in the western, Polish-populated part of Galicia. Polish manorial gentry supported or were sympathetic to barely concealed plans for an [[Greater Poland Uprising (1846)|uprising to establish an independent Polish state]], but peasants on the manorial estates of western Galicia, reduced to misery by poor harvests, saw little advantage for themselves in a free Poland and seized the opportunity to rise against the institution of [[serfdom]], [[Galician slaughter|killing many of the estate owners]]. With the collapse of the uprising for a free Poland, the city of [[Krak\u00f3w]] lost its semi-autonomy and was integrated into the Austrian Empire under the title of a Grand Duchy, and for practical purposes was made part of Galicia by the Austrian authorities.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = H.M.

A circle of activists, primarily Greek Catholic seminarians, affected by the romantic movement in Europe and the example of fellow Slavs elsewhere, especially in eastern Ukraine under the Russians, began to turn their attention to the common folk and their language. In 1837, the so-called Ruthenian Triad led by [[Markiian Shashkevych]], published ''The Nymph of the Dniester'', a collection of folksongs and other materials in the common Ruthenian tongue. Alarmed by such democratism, the Austrian authorities and the Greek Catholic Metropolitan banned the book.\n\nIn 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutionary actions broke out in Vienna and other parts of the Austrian Empire]]. In Lemberg, a Polish National Council, and then later, a Ukrainian, or Ruthenian Supreme Council were formed. Even before Vienna had acted, the remnants of serfdom were abolished by the Governor, Franz Stadion, in an attempt to thwart the revolutionaries. Moreover, Polish demands for Galician automomy were countered by Ruthenian demands for national equality and for a partition of the province into an Eastern, Ruthenian part, and a Western, Polish part. Eventually, Lemberg was bombarded by imperial troops and the revolution put down completely.\n\nA decade of renewed absolutism followed, but to placate the Poles, Count [[Agenor Go\u0142uchowski (father)|Agenor Goluchowski]], a conservative representative of the eastern Galician aristocracy, the so-called Podolians, was appointed Viceroy. He began to Polonize the local administration and managed to have Ruthenian ideas of partitioning the province shelved. He was unsuccessful, however, in forcing the Greek Catholic Church to shift to the use of the western or Gregorian calendar, or among Ruthenians generally, to replace the Cyrillic alphabet with the Latin alphabet.\n\n===Constitutional experiments===\n{{See also|Diet of Galicia}}\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|250px|[[Galician slaughter]] (''Polish'' \"Rze\u017a galicyjska\") by [[Jan Lewicki]] (1795\u20131871)]]\n\nIn 1859, following Austro-Hungarian military defeat in Italy, the Empire entered a period of constitutional experiments. In 1860, the [[Vienna]] Government, influenced by [[Agenor Go\u0142uchowski (father)|Agenor Goluchowski]], issued its October Diploma, which envisioned a conservative federalization of the empire, but a negative reaction in the German-speaking lands led to changes in government and the issuing of the February Patent which watered down this de-centralization. Nevertheless, by 1861, Galicia was granted a Legislative Assembly or ''[[Galicia Diet]]''. Although at first pro-Habsburg Ukrainian and Polish peasant representation was considerable in this body (about half the assembly), and the pressing social and Ukrainian questions were discussed, administrative pressures limited the effectiveness of both peasant and Ukrainian representatives and the ''[[Diet of Galicia]]'' (Polish ''Sejm'') became dominated by the Polish aristocracy and gentry, who favoured further [[autonomous entity|autonomy]]. This same year, disturbances broke out in Russian Poland and to some extent spilled over into Galicia. The Sejm ceased to sit.\n\nBy 1863, open revolt broke out in Russian Poland and from 1864 to 1865 the Austro-Hungarian government declared a State of Siege in Galicia, temporarily suspending civil liberties.\n\nThe year 1865 brought a return to federal ideas along the lines suggested by [[Agenor Go\u0142uchowski (father)|Agenor Goluchowski]] and negotiations on autonomy between the Polish aristocracy and Vienna began once again.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Ruthenians]] felt more and more abandoned by Vienna and among the \"Old Ruthenians\" grouped around the Greek Catholic Cathedral of Saint George, there occurred a turn towards Russia. The more extreme supporters of this orientation came to be known as \"[[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophiles]]\". At the same time, influenced by the [[Ukrainian language]] poetry of the eastern Ukrainian writer, [[Taras Shevchenko]], a Ukrainophile movement arose which published literature in the Ukrainian/Ruthenian vernacular and eventually established a network of reading halls. Supporters of this orientation came to be known as \"Populists\", and later, simply as \"Ukrainians\". Almost all [[Ruthenians]], however, still hoped for national equality and for an administrative division of Galicia along ethnic lines.\n\n===Galician autonomy===\n[[File:Sejm Galicyjski.jpg|thumb|260px|The Galician Sejm (parliament) in Lemberg (modern Lviv)]]\n\nIn 1866, following the [[Battle of Sadova]] and the Austrian defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]], the Austro-Hungarian empire began to experience increased internal problems. In an effort to shore up support for the monarchy, Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] began negotiations for a compromise with the [[Magyars|Magyar]] nobility to ensure their support. Some members of the government, such as the Austro-Hungarian prime minister [[Richard von Belcredi|Count Belcredi]], advised the Emperor to make a more comprehensive constitutional deal with all of the nationalities that would have created a federal structure. Belcredi worried that an accommodation with the Magyar interests would alienate the other nationalities. However, Franz Joseph was unable to ignore the power of the Magyar nobility, and they would not accept anything less than dualism between themselves and the traditional Austrian \u00e9lites.\n\nFinally, after the so-called [[Ausgleich]] of February 1867, the Austrian Empire was reformed into a dualist [[Austria-Hungary]]. Although the Polish and Czech plans for their parts of the monarchy to be included in the federal structure failed, a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. Representatives of the Polish aristocracy and [[intelligentsia]] addressed the Emperor asking for greater autonomy for Galicia. Their demands were not accepted outright, but over the course of the next several years a number of significant concessions were made toward the establishment of Galician autonomy.\n\nFrom 1873, Galicia was ''de facto'' an autonomous province of [[Austria-Hungary]] with [[Polish language|Polish]] and, to a much lesser degree, Ukrainian or [[Ruthenia]]n, as official languages. The [[Germanisation]] had been halted and the [[censorship]] lifted as well. Galicia was subject to the [[Cisleithania|Austrian part]] of the Dual Monarchy, but the [[Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galician Sejm]] and provincial administration had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs.\n\nThese changes were supported by many Polish intellectuals. In 1869 a group of young conservative publicists in Krak\u00f3w, including [[J\u00f3zef Szujski]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Tarnowski]], [[Stanislaw Kozmian|Stanis\u0142aw Ko\u017amian]] and [[Ludwik Wodzicki]], published a series of satirical pamphlets entitled ''Teka Sta\u0144czyka'' (''[[Sta\u0144czyk|Sta\u0144czyk's]] Portfolio''). Only five years after the tragic end of the [[January Uprising]], the pamphlets ridiculed the idea of armed [[List of Polish uprisings|national uprisings]] and suggested compromise with Poland's enemies, especially the [[Austrian Empire]], concentration on economic growth, and acceptance of the [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] offered by Vienna. This political grouping came to be known as the Stanczyks or Krak\u00f3w Conservatives. Together with the eastern Galician conservative Polish landowners and aristocracy called the \"Podolians\", they gained a political ascendency in Galicia which lasted to 1914. This shift in power from [[Vienna]] to the Polish landowning class was not welcomed by the Ruthenians, who became more sharply divided into [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophiles]], who looked to Russia for salvation, and [[Ukrainians]] who stressed their connections to the common people.\n\nBoth [[Vienna]] and the Poles saw treason among the Russophiles and a series of political trials eventually discredited them. Meanwhile, by 1890, an agreement was worked out between the Poles and the \"Populist\" Ruthenians or [[Ukrainians]] which saw the partial Ukrainianization of the school system in eastern Galicia and other concessions to Ukrainian culture. Thereafter, the Ukrainian national movement spread rapidly among the Ruthenian peasantry and, despite repeated setbacks, by the early years of the twentieth century this movement had almost completely replaced other Ruthenian groups as the main rival for power with the Poles. Throughout this period, the Ukrainians never gave up the traditional Ruthenian demands for national equality and for partition of the province into a western, Polish half, and an eastern, Ukrainian half.\n\n{{Polish statehood}}\n{{Ukrainian statehood}}\n\n===The Great Economic Emigration===\nBeginning in the 1880s, a mass [[emigration]] of the Galician peasantry occurred. The emigration started as a seasonal one to Germany (newly unified and economically dynamic) and then later became a Trans-Atlantic one with large-scale emigration to the [[United States]], [[Brazil]], and [[Canada]].\n\nCaused by the [[Poverty in Austrian Galicia|backward economic condition of Galicia]] where rural poverty was widespread, the emigration began in the western, Polish populated part of Galicia and quickly shifted east to the Ukrainian inhabited parts. Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, and Germans all participated in this mass movement of countryfolk and villagers. Poles migrated principally to New England and the midwestern states of the United States, but also to Brazil and elsewhere; Ruthenians/Ukrainians migrated to Brazil, Canada, and the United States, with a very intense emigration from Western [[Podolia]] to Western [[Canada]]; and Jews emigrated both directly to the New World and also indirectly via other parts of Austria-Hungary.\n\nA total of several hundred thousand people were involved in this Great Economic Emigration which grew steadily more intense until the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914. The war put a temporary halt to the emigration which never again reached the same proportions.\n\nThe Great Economic Emigration, especially the emigration to Brazil, the \"Brazilian Fever\" as it was called at the time, was described in contemporary literary works by the Polish poet [[Maria Konopnicka]], the Ukrainian writer [[Ivan Franko]], and many others. Some states in [[South Region, Brazil|south of Brazil]] have a large percentage of their population formed by direct descendants of these Ruthenians/Ukrainians immigrants.\n\nWhen it comes to the social relations, most especially between peasants and landlords, the area was the most backwards in the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. When the lot of the peasants under the [[Prussian partition]] was made better by laws and in the [[Russian partition]] by the majority of the Polish landlords de facto abolishing serfdom in exchange for the peasants sending their children to free-of-charge (secret with respect to the Polish language) schools training them to be Poles and nobility adopted all free peasants to prevent the steady rising in power and influence, Russian-Jewish merchant households from forcing them into serfdom, the Galician peasantry was always living at the verge of starvation. This led the Polish peasants to call the area \"Krolestwo Goloty i Glodomerji\" i.e. \"The Kingdom of Bareness and Starvation\". Since country to the Russian Tsar Alexander II, whom had officially banned serfdom and liberated the serfs in the empire by the 1870s and enacted legislation to protect the serfs, the possibility remained and was the case within Galicia that the serfs and monied city denizens could be coerced or forced through predatory practices back into serfdom by the affluent merchant class and local nobility, which remained the case for many years until the start of World War I.\n\nAt the same time as these emigrations in the 1890s, many Polish and Ukrainian liberals saw Galicia as a Galician Piedmont, both a Polish Piedmont and a Ukrainian Piedmont. Because Italians had started their liberation from Austrian rule in the Italian Piedmont, these Ukrainian and Polish nationalists felt that the liberation of their two countries would begin in Galicia.\n\nDespite nearly 750,000 persons emigrating across the Atlantic from 1880 to 1914, Galicia's population increased by 45% between 1869 and 1910.<ref name=AustriaOil>{{cite web|last=Frank |first=Allison |title=Galician California, Galician Hell: The Peril and Promise of Oil Production in Austria-Hungary |url=http://ostaustria.org/bridges-magazine/volume-10-june-29-2006/item/1172-galician-california-galician-hell-the-peril-and-promise-of-oil-production-in-austria-hungary |publisher=Office of Science and Technology Austria (OSTA) |location=Washington, D.C. |date=June 29, 2006 |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509183618/http://ostaustria.org/bridges-magazine/volume-10-june-29-2006/item/1172-galician-california-galician-hell-the-peril-and-promise-of-oil-production-in-austria-hungary |archivedate=May 9, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===First World War and Polish-Ukrainian conflict===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]] Galicia saw heavy fighting between the forces of Russia and the [[Central Powers]]. The Russian forces overran most of the region in 1914 after defeating the Austro-Hungarian army in a chaotic frontier [[Eastern Front (WWI)|battle]] in the opening months of the war. They were in turn pushed out in the spring and summer of 1915 by a [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive|combined German and Austro-Hungarian offensive]].\n\n[[File:Szturm Twierdzy Przemysl A. Ritter von Meissl.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The [[Siege of Przemy\u015bl]] in 1915]]\n\nIn 1918, Western Galicia became a part of the restored [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]], which absorbed the [[Lemko Republic|Lemko-Rusyn Republic]]. The local Ukrainian population briefly declared the independence of Eastern Galicia as the \"[[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]\". During the [[Polish-Soviet War]] the Soviets tried to establish the [[puppet-state]] of the [[Galician SSR]] in East Galicia, the government of which after couple of months was liquidated.\n\nThe fate of Galicia was settled by the [[Peace of Riga]] on March 18, 1921, attributing Galicia to the [[Second Polish Republic]]. Although never accepted as legitimate by some Ukrainians, it was internationally recognized with significant French support on May 15, 1923.<ref>French: ''Les Alli\u00e9s reconnaissent \u00e0 la Pologne la possession de la Galicie'', Chronologie des civilisations, Jean Delorme, Paris, 1956.</ref> The French support for Polish rule of ethnically Ukrainian eastern Galicia and its oil resources in the Borys\u0142aw-Drohobycz basin were rewarded by Warsaw allowing significant French investment to pour into the Polish oil industry.<ref name=AustriaOil/> The Poles had convinced the French that since less than 25% of the ethnic Ukrainians were literate before the Great War and Ukrainians were novices in governing themselves, only the Poles, not the Ukrainians, would be able to administer eastern Galicia and its precious oil assets.<ref name=AustriaOil/>\n\nThe Ukrainians of the former eastern Galicia and the neighbouring province of [[Volhynia]] made up about 12% of the population of the [[Second Polish Republic]], and were its largest minority. As Polish government policies were unfriendly towards minorities, tensions between the Polish government and the Ukrainian population grew, eventually giving the rise to the militant underground [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{Main article|Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria}}\nSoon the newly acquired Polish territories (see [[First Partition of Poland]]) which were known as Kreise (Voivodeship in Poland) were restructured in November 1773 into 59 Kreisdistriktes (Land districts), while kreises were abolished. Some former voivodeships were incorporated completely, while most of them only partially. Among them were the former voivodeships of Belz, Red-Ruthenian, Cracow, Lublin, Sandomierz, and Podolie. Also during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u201374)|Russo-Turkish War]] in 1769, the northwestern territory of [[Moldavia]] (renamed [[Bukovina]]) was occupied by the [[Russian Empire]] which [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca|ceded]] it in 1774 to the [[Austrian Empire]] as a \"token of appreciation\".\n\n===Major cities and towns===\n====Administrative division====\nThe Kingdom was split into numerous counties (powiat) which in 1914 were about 75.<ref>[http://www.ukrstor.com/ukrstor/galicia540_30.jpg Map of the Kingdom with its county division (Lenius, Brian. \"Genealogical Gazetteer of Galicia\" 2nd ed.

There were nearly 19,000 noble families with 95,000 members (about 3% of the population). The \"non-free\" accounted for 1.86 million, more than 70% of the population. A small number were full farmers, but by far the overwhelming number (84%) had only smallholdings or no possessions.\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0442\u044f 1.jpg|thumb|People of East Galicia]]\n[[File:Zarubezhnaia Rus.jpg|thumb|Map of a region where Ruthenians lived in the [[Austrian Empire]] \u2013 Galicia and Hungarian Rus' ([[Carpathian Ruthenia]]) \u2013 by [[Dmitry Vergun]]]]\n\nNo country of the Austrian monarchy had such a varied ethnic mix as Galicia: [[Poles]], [[Ruthenians]], [[Germans]] ([[Galician Germans]]), [[Armenia]]ns, [[Galician Jews|Jews]], [[Hungarians]], [[Romani people]], [[Lipovans|Lipowaner]], etc. The Poles were mainly in the west, with the Ruthenians (Ukrainians) predominant in the eastern region (\"Ruthenia\"). \n\nThe Jews of Galicia had immigrated in the Middle Ages from Germany and mostly spoke [[Yiddish]] as their first language. German-speaking people were more commonly referred to as \"Saxons\" or \"Swabians\", even though most of them did not come from [[Saxony]] or [[Swabia]] (cf. [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and [[Danube Swabians]]). There were also some [[Mennonite]]s who mostly came originally from [[Switzerland]], but spoke a dialect of [[Palatine German language|Palatine German]] which is close to [[Pennsylvania German]].\n\nWith inhabitants who had a clear difference in language such as with the Saxons or the Roma identification was less problematic, but widespread multilingualness blurred the borders again. \n\nIt is however possible to make a clear distinction in religious denominations: the majority of the Poles were [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin Catholics]], while the Ruthenians were mostly [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholics]]. The Jews, who represented the third largest religious group, were mostly traditional in their religious observance which later developed into [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\nThe average life expectancy was 27 years for men and 28.5 years for women, as compared to 33 and 37 in [[Bohemia]], 39 and 41 in [[France]] and 40 and 42 in [[England]]. Also the quality of life was much lower.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} The yearly consumption of meat did not exceed {{convert|10|kg|0|abbr=on}} per capita, as compared to {{convert|24|kg|0|abbr=on}} in Hungary and 33 in Germany. This was mostly due to much lower average income.\n\nIn 1888 Galicia extended over {{convert|78550|km\u00b2|0|abbr=out}} and had a population of about 6.4 million people, including 4.8 million peasants (75% of the whole population). The population density, at 81 people per square kilometre, was higher than that of France (71 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>) or Germany. The population rose to 7.3 million in 1900 and to 8 million in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|title=Austria-Hungary: historical demographical data of the administrative division prior to 1918|url=http://www.populstat.info/Europe/austriop.htm|website=Populstat|accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Religions demographics<br />(per the December 1910 census)\n|-\n!

Its level of development was comparable to or higher than that of Russia and the Balkans, but well behind Western Europe.\n\nThe first detailed description of the economic situation of the region was prepared by Stanislaw Szczepanowski (1846\u20131900), a Polish lawyer, economist and chemist who in 1873 published the first version of his report titled ''N\u0119dza galicyjska w cyfrach'' (''The Galician Poverty in Numbers''). Based on his own experience as a worker in the [[India Office]], as well as his work on development of the oil industry in the region of [[Borys\u0142aw, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship|Borys\u0142aw]] and the official census data published by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] government, he described Galicia as one of the poorest regions in Europe.\n\nStatistics indicate the Galicia and Lodomeria was poorer than areas west of it. The average income per capita did not exceed 53 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|Rhine guilders]] (RG), as compared to 91 RG in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], 100 in Hungary and more than 450 RG in England at that time. Also the taxes were relatively high and equalled to 9 Rhine guilders a year (c. 17% of yearly income), as compared to 5% in Prussia and 10% in England. Also the percentage of people with higher income was much lower than in other parts of the Monarchy and Europe: the luxury tax, paid by people whose yearly income exceeded 600 RG, was paid by 8 people in every 1,000 inhabitants, as compared to 28 in Bohemia and 99 in [[Lower Austria]]. Despite high taxation, the national debt of the Galician government exceeded 300 million RG at all times, that is approximately 60 RG per capita.\n\nAll in all, the region was used by the Austro-Hungarian government mostly as a reservoir of cheap workforce and recruits for the army,{{citation needed|date=August 2007}} as well as a buffer zone against Russia. It was not until early in the 20th century that heavy industry started to be developed, which would be comparable to much of Russia and the Balkans. Even then it was mostly connected to war production. The biggest state investments in the region were the railways and the fortresses in [[Przemy\u015bl, Poland|Przemy\u015bl]], Krak\u00f3w and other cities. Industrial development was mostly connected to the private oil industry started by [[Ignacy Lukasiewicz|Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] and to the [[Wieliczka salt mine]]s, operational since at least the [[Middle Ages]].\n\n===Industry===\nIn 1880, industry in Galicia was at a low level. In 1857 Galicia had 102,189 persons or 2.2% of the population worked in industry. By 1870 that number had risen to 179,626, or 3.3% of the population.\n\n===Oil and natural gas industry===\n{{See also|The Petroleum Trail}}\n[[File:Galicia 1897 1.jpg|thumb|330px|Rail lines of Galicia before 1897]]\nNear [[Drohobych]] and [[Boryslav]] in Galicia, significant oil reserves were [https://web.archive.org/web/20161006104622/http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/drohobycz/maps/Map_oilfields.asp discovered and developed] during the mid 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref name=DrohobychOil>{{cite web | last1 = Schatzker | first1 = Valerie | last2 = Erdheim | first2 = Claudia | last3 = Sharontitle | first3 = Alexander | title = Petroleum in Galicia | url = http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/drohobycz/history/petroleum.asp | publisher = Drohobycz Administrative District: History | accessdate = April 20, 2016 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160410201456/http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/drohobycz/history/petroleum.asp | archivedate = April 10, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=CarpathianOil>{{cite book | last1= Golonka | first1 = Jan | last2 = Picha | first2 = Frank J. | title = The Carpathians and Their Foreland: Geology and Hydrocarbon Resources | publisher = American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) | date = 2006 | isbn = 9780891813651}}</ref> The first European attempt to drill for oil was in [[B\u00f3brka, Krosno County|B\u00f3brka]] in western Galicia in 1854.<ref name=DrohobychOil/><ref name=CarpathianOil/> By 1867, a well at [[Kl\u0119czany, Nowy S\u0105cz County|Kleczany]], in Western Galicia, was drilled using steam to about 200 meters.<ref name=DrohobychOil/><ref name=CarpathianOil/> On December 31, 1872, a [[Galician Transversal Railway|railway line]] linking Borys\u0142aw (now Boryslav) with the nearby city of Drohobycz (now Drohobych) was opened.

After the [[Third Partition of Poland]] in 1795, it became a Kingdom under Habsburg rule. In 1804 it became a crownland of the [[Austrian Empire]]. From 1867 it was a [[Poles|Polish]]-administered autonomous crownland under [[Cisleithania|Cisleithanian]] [[Austria-Hungary]], until its dissolution in 1918. The country was carved from the entire south-western part of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Among the many ceremonial titles of the princes of Hungary was \"ruler of Galicia and Lodomeria\". Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Austrian Empire ceded portions of Galicia to the [[Russian Empire]], [[West Galicia]] and Tarnopol District.\n\nThe name \"Galicia\" is the Latinized form of [[Principality of Halych|Halych]], a principality of the medieval [[Ruthenia]]. \"[[Lodomeria]]\", is also a [[Latinized name|Latinized form]] of [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]] that was founded in the 10th century by [[Vladimir the Great]] and until the [[partitions of Poland]] was known simply as Volodymyr ({{lang-pl|W\u0142odzimierz}}). King of Galicia and Lodomeria was a medieval title which the King of Hungary ([[Andrew II of Hungary|Andrew II]]) adopted during his conquest of the region in the 12th century.\n\nThis historical region in [[Eastern Europe]] is divided today between [[Poland]] and [[Ukraine]].

As such, the [[Austria]]n region of [[Poland]] and what was later to become [[Ukraine]] was known as the Kingdom of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Lodomeria]] to underline the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] claims to the country. However, after the [[Third Partition of Poland]], a large portion of the ethnically Polish lands to the west ([[West Galicia|New or West Galicia]]) was also added to the province, which changed the geographical reference of the term ''Galicia''. Lviv ([[Lemberg]]) served as capital of Austrian Galicia, which was dominated by the Polish aristocracy, despite the fact that the population of the eastern half of the province was mostly [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]], or \"[[Ruthenia]]n\", as they were known at the time. In addition to the Polish aristocracy and gentry who inhabited almost all parts of Galicia, and the Ruthenians in the east, there existed a large Jewish population, also more heavily concentrated in the eastern parts of the province.\n\nDuring the first decades of Austrian rule, Galicia was firmly governed from [[Vienna]], and many significant reforms were carried out by a bureaucracy staffed largely by Germans and Czechs. The aristocracy was guaranteed its rights, but these rights were considerably circumscribed. The former serfs were no longer mere chattel, but became subjects of law and were granted certain personal freedoms, such as the right to marry without the lord's permission. Their labour obligations were defined and limited, and they could bypass the lords and appeal to the imperial courts for justice. The Eastern Rite \"Uniate\" Church, which primarily served the Ruthenians, was renamed the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic Church]] to bring it onto a par with the Roman Catholic Church; it was given seminaries, and eventually, a Metropolitan. Although unpopular with the aristocracy, among the common folk, Polish and Ukrainian/Ruthenian alike, these reforms created a reservoir of good will toward the emperor which lasted almost to the end of Austrian rule. At the same time, however, the Austrian Empire extracted from Galicia considerable wealth{{Citation needed|reason=Significant transfer payments(less taxes raised compared to expendature) in the Kingdom. -Page 160.

The large city of [[Krak\u00f3w]] and surrounding territory, formerly also part of New or West Galicia, became the semi-autonomous [[Free City of Krak\u00f3w]] unter supervision of the three powers sharing rule over Poland (i. e., Austria, Russia and Prussia).\n[[File:Map of the Kingdom of Galicia, 1914.jpg|400px|right|thumb|Physical map of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, 1849\u20131918]]\n\nThe 1820s and 1830s were a period of bureaucratic rule overseen from Vienna. Most administrative positions were filled by German-speakers, including German-speaking Czechs, although some of their children were already becoming Polonized. After the failure of the November insurrection in Russian Poland in 1830\u201331, in which a few thousand Galician volunteers participated, many Polish refugees arrived in Galicia. The latter 1830s were rife with Polish conspiratorial organizations whose work culminated in the [[Krak\u00f3w Uprising|unsuccessful Galician insurrection of 1846]], which was easily put down by the Austrians with the help of a Galician peasantry that remained loyal to the emperor. The insurrection occurred in the western, Polish-populated part of Galicia. Polish manorial gentry supported or were sympathetic to barely concealed plans for an [[Greater Poland Uprising (1846)|uprising to establish an independent Polish state]], but peasants on the manorial estates of western Galicia, reduced to misery by poor harvests, saw little advantage for themselves in a free Poland and seized the opportunity to rise against the institution of [[serfdom]], [[Galician slaughter|killing many of the estate owners]]. With the collapse of the uprising for a free Poland, the city of [[Krak\u00f3w]] lost its semi-autonomy and was integrated into the Austrian Empire under the title of a Grand Duchy, and for practical purposes was made part of Galicia by the Austrian authorities.<ref>{{Cite book\n| publisher = H.M.

A circle of activists, primarily Greek Catholic seminarians, affected by the romantic movement in Europe and the example of fellow Slavs elsewhere, especially in eastern Ukraine under the Russians, began to turn their attention to the common folk and their language. In 1837, the so-called Ruthenian Triad led by [[Markiian Shashkevych]], published ''The Nymph of the Dniester'', a collection of folksongs and other materials in the common Ruthenian tongue. Alarmed by such democratism, the Austrian authorities and the Greek Catholic Metropolitan banned the book.\n\nIn 1848, [[Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire|revolutionary actions broke out in Vienna and other parts of the Austrian Empire]]. In Lemberg, a Polish National Council, and then later, a Ukrainian, or Ruthenian Supreme Council were formed. Even before Vienna had acted, the remnants of serfdom were abolished by the Governor, Franz Stadion, in an attempt to thwart the revolutionaries. Moreover, Polish demands for Galician automomy were countered by Ruthenian demands for national equality and for a partition of the province into an Eastern, Ruthenian part, and a Western, Polish part. Eventually, Lemberg was bombarded by imperial troops and the revolution put down completely.\n\nA decade of renewed absolutism followed, but to placate the Poles, Count [[Agenor Go\u0142uchowski (father)|Agenor Goluchowski]], a conservative representative of the eastern Galician aristocracy, the so-called Podolians, was appointed Viceroy. He began to Polonize the local administration and managed to have Ruthenian ideas of partitioning the province shelved. He was unsuccessful, however, in forcing the Greek Catholic Church to shift to the use of the western or Gregorian calendar, or among Ruthenians generally, to replace the Cyrillic alphabet with the Latin alphabet.\n\n===Constitutional experiments===\n{{See also|Diet of Galicia}}\n[[File:Galician slaughter in 1846.PNG|thumb|250px|[[Galician slaughter]] (''Polish'' \"Rze\u017a galicyjska\") by [[Jan Lewicki]] (1795\u20131871)]]\n\nIn 1859, following Austro-Hungarian military defeat in Italy, the Empire entered a period of constitutional experiments. In 1860, the [[Vienna]] Government, influenced by [[Agenor Go\u0142uchowski (father)|Agenor Goluchowski]], issued its October Diploma, which envisioned a conservative federalization of the empire, but a negative reaction in the German-speaking lands led to changes in government and the issuing of the February Patent which watered down this de-centralization. Nevertheless, by 1861, Galicia was granted a Legislative Assembly or ''[[Galicia Diet]]''. Although at first pro-Habsburg Ukrainian and Polish peasant representation was considerable in this body (about half the assembly), and the pressing social and Ukrainian questions were discussed, administrative pressures limited the effectiveness of both peasant and Ukrainian representatives and the ''[[Diet of Galicia]]'' (Polish ''Sejm'') became dominated by the Polish aristocracy and gentry, who favoured further [[autonomous entity|autonomy]]. This same year, disturbances broke out in Russian Poland and to some extent spilled over into Galicia. The Sejm ceased to sit.\n\nBy 1863, open revolt broke out in Russian Poland and from 1864 to 1865 the Austro-Hungarian government declared a State of Siege in Galicia, temporarily suspending civil liberties.\n\nThe year 1865 brought a return to federal ideas along the lines suggested by [[Agenor Go\u0142uchowski (father)|Agenor Goluchowski]] and negotiations on autonomy between the Polish aristocracy and Vienna began once again.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Ruthenians]] felt more and more abandoned by Vienna and among the \"Old Ruthenians\" grouped around the Greek Catholic Cathedral of Saint George, there occurred a turn towards Russia. The more extreme supporters of this orientation came to be known as \"[[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophiles]]\". At the same time, influenced by the [[Ukrainian language]] poetry of the eastern Ukrainian writer, [[Taras Shevchenko]], a Ukrainophile movement arose which published literature in the Ukrainian/Ruthenian vernacular and eventually established a network of reading halls. Supporters of this orientation came to be known as \"Populists\", and later, simply as \"Ukrainians\". Almost all [[Ruthenians]], however, still hoped for national equality and for an administrative division of Galicia along ethnic lines.\n\n===Galician autonomy===\n[[File:Sejm Galicyjski.jpg|thumb|260px|The Galician Sejm (parliament) in Lemberg (modern Lviv)]]\n\nIn 1866, following the [[Battle of Sadova]] and the Austrian defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]], the Austro-Hungarian empire began to experience increased internal problems. In an effort to shore up support for the monarchy, Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] began negotiations for a compromise with the [[Magyars|Magyar]] nobility to ensure their support. Some members of the government, such as the Austro-Hungarian prime minister [[Richard von Belcredi|Count Belcredi]], advised the Emperor to make a more comprehensive constitutional deal with all of the nationalities that would have created a federal structure. Belcredi worried that an accommodation with the Magyar interests would alienate the other nationalities. However, Franz Joseph was unable to ignore the power of the Magyar nobility, and they would not accept anything less than dualism between themselves and the traditional Austrian \u00e9lites.\n\nFinally, after the so-called [[Ausgleich]] of February 1867, the Austrian Empire was reformed into a dualist [[Austria-Hungary]]. Although the Polish and Czech plans for their parts of the monarchy to be included in the federal structure failed, a slow yet steady process of liberalisation of Austrian rule in Galicia started. Representatives of the Polish aristocracy and [[intelligentsia]] addressed the Emperor asking for greater autonomy for Galicia. Their demands were not accepted outright, but over the course of the next several years a number of significant concessions were made toward the establishment of Galician autonomy.\n\nFrom 1873, Galicia was ''de facto'' an autonomous province of [[Austria-Hungary]] with [[Polish language|Polish]] and, to a much lesser degree, Ukrainian or [[Ruthenia]]n, as official languages. The [[Germanisation]] had been halted and the [[censorship]] lifted as well. Galicia was subject to the [[Cisleithania|Austrian part]] of the Dual Monarchy, but the [[Diet of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galician Sejm]] and provincial administration had extensive privileges and prerogatives, especially in education, culture, and local affairs.\n\nThese changes were supported by many Polish intellectuals. In 1869 a group of young conservative publicists in Krak\u00f3w, including [[J\u00f3zef Szujski]], [[Stanis\u0142aw Tarnowski]], [[Stanislaw Kozmian|Stanis\u0142aw Ko\u017amian]] and [[Ludwik Wodzicki]], published a series of satirical pamphlets entitled ''Teka Sta\u0144czyka'' (''[[Sta\u0144czyk|Sta\u0144czyk's]] Portfolio''). Only five years after the tragic end of the [[January Uprising]], the pamphlets ridiculed the idea of armed [[List of Polish uprisings|national uprisings]] and suggested compromise with Poland's enemies, especially the [[Austrian Empire]], concentration on economic growth, and acceptance of the [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] offered by Vienna. This political grouping came to be known as the Stanczyks or Krak\u00f3w Conservatives. Together with the eastern Galician conservative Polish landowners and aristocracy called the \"Podolians\", they gained a political ascendency in Galicia which lasted to 1914. This shift in power from [[Vienna]] to the Polish landowning class was not welcomed by the Ruthenians, who became more sharply divided into [[Ukrainian Russophiles|Russophiles]], who looked to Russia for salvation, and [[Ukrainians]] who stressed their connections to the common people.\n\nBoth [[Vienna]] and the Poles saw treason among the Russophiles and a series of political trials eventually discredited them. Meanwhile, by 1890, an agreement was worked out between the Poles and the \"Populist\" Ruthenians or [[Ukrainians]] which saw the partial Ukrainianization of the school system in eastern Galicia and other concessions to Ukrainian culture. Thereafter, the Ukrainian national movement spread rapidly among the Ruthenian peasantry and, despite repeated setbacks, by the early years of the twentieth century this movement had almost completely replaced other Ruthenian groups as the main rival for power with the Poles. Throughout this period, the Ukrainians never gave up the traditional Ruthenian demands for national equality and for partition of the province into a western, Polish half, and an eastern, Ukrainian half.\n\n{{Polish statehood}}\n{{Ukrainian statehood}}\n\n===The Great Economic Emigration===\nBeginning in the 1880s, a mass [[emigration]] of the Galician peasantry occurred. The emigration started as a seasonal one to Germany (newly unified and economically dynamic) and then later became a Trans-Atlantic one with large-scale emigration to the [[United States]], [[Brazil]], and [[Canada]].\n\nCaused by the [[Poverty in Austrian Galicia|backward economic condition of Galicia]] where rural poverty was widespread, the emigration began in the western, Polish populated part of Galicia and quickly shifted east to the Ukrainian inhabited parts. Poles, Ukrainians, Jews, and Germans all participated in this mass movement of countryfolk and villagers. Poles migrated principally to New England and the midwestern states of the United States, but also to Brazil and elsewhere; Ruthenians/Ukrainians migrated to Brazil, Canada, and the United States, with a very intense emigration from Western [[Podolia]] to Western [[Canada]]; and Jews emigrated both directly to the New World and also indirectly via other parts of Austria-Hungary.\n\nA total of several hundred thousand people were involved in this Great Economic Emigration which grew steadily more intense until the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914. The war put a temporary halt to the emigration which never again reached the same proportions.\n\nThe Great Economic Emigration, especially the emigration to Brazil, the \"Brazilian Fever\" as it was called at the time, was described in contemporary literary works by the Polish poet [[Maria Konopnicka]], the Ukrainian writer [[Ivan Franko]], and many others. Some states in [[South Region, Brazil|south of Brazil]] have a large percentage of their population formed by direct descendants of these Ruthenians/Ukrainians immigrants.\n\nWhen it comes to the social relations, most especially between peasants and landlords, the area was the most backwards in the former [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. When the lot of the peasants under the [[Prussian partition]] was made better by laws and in the [[Russian partition]] by the majority of the Polish landlords de facto abolishing serfdom in exchange for the peasants sending their children to free-of-charge (secret with respect to the Polish language) schools training them to be Poles and nobility adopted all free peasants to prevent the steady rising in power and influence, Russian-Jewish merchant households from forcing them into serfdom, the Galician peasantry was always living at the verge of starvation. This led the Polish peasants to call the area \"Krolestwo Goloty i Glodomerji\" i.e. \"The Kingdom of Bareness and Starvation\". Since country to the Russian Tsar Alexander II, whom had officially banned serfdom and liberated the serfs in the empire by the 1870s and enacted legislation to protect the serfs, the possibility remained and was the case within Galicia that the serfs and monied city denizens could be coerced or forced through predatory practices back into serfdom by the affluent merchant class and local nobility, which remained the case for many years until the start of World War I.\n\nAt the same time as these emigrations in the 1890s, many Polish and Ukrainian liberals saw Galicia as a Galician Piedmont, both a Polish Piedmont and a Ukrainian Piedmont. Because Italians had started their liberation from Austrian rule in the Italian Piedmont, these Ukrainian and Polish nationalists felt that the liberation of their two countries would begin in Galicia.\n\nDespite nearly 750,000 persons emigrating across the Atlantic from 1880 to 1914, Galicia's population increased by 45% between 1869 and 1910.<ref name=AustriaOil>{{cite web|last=Frank |first=Allison |title=Galician California, Galician Hell: The Peril and Promise of Oil Production in Austria-Hungary |url=http://ostaustria.org/bridges-magazine/volume-10-june-29-2006/item/1172-galician-california-galician-hell-the-peril-and-promise-of-oil-production-in-austria-hungary |publisher=Office of Science and Technology Austria (OSTA) |location=Washington, D.C. |date=June 29, 2006 |accessdate=April 20, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160509183618/http://ostaustria.org/bridges-magazine/volume-10-june-29-2006/item/1172-galician-california-galician-hell-the-peril-and-promise-of-oil-production-in-austria-hungary |archivedate=May 9, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===First World War and Polish-Ukrainian conflict===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]] Galicia saw heavy fighting between the forces of Russia and the [[Central Powers]]. The Russian forces overran most of the region in 1914 after defeating the Austro-Hungarian army in a chaotic frontier [[Eastern Front (WWI)|battle]] in the opening months of the war. They were in turn pushed out in the spring and summer of 1915 by a [[Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive|combined German and Austro-Hungarian offensive]].\n\n[[File:Szturm Twierdzy Przemysl A. Ritter von Meissl.jpg|thumb|left|230px|The [[Siege of Przemy\u015bl]] in 1915]]\n\nIn 1918, Western Galicia became a part of the restored [[Second Polish Republic|Republic of Poland]], which absorbed the [[Lemko Republic|Lemko-Rusyn Republic]]. The local Ukrainian population briefly declared the independence of Eastern Galicia as the \"[[West Ukrainian People's Republic]]\". During the [[Polish-Soviet War]] the Soviets tried to establish the [[puppet-state]] of the [[Galician SSR]] in East Galicia, the government of which after couple of months was liquidated.\n\nThe fate of Galicia was settled by the [[Peace of Riga]] on March 18, 1921, attributing Galicia to the [[Second Polish Republic]]. Although never accepted as legitimate by some Ukrainians, it was internationally recognized with significant French support on May 15, 1923.<ref>French: ''Les Alli\u00e9s reconnaissent \u00e0 la Pologne la possession de la Galicie'', Chronologie des civilisations, Jean Delorme, Paris, 1956.</ref> The French support for Polish rule of ethnically Ukrainian eastern Galicia and its oil resources in the Borys\u0142aw-Drohobycz basin were rewarded by Warsaw allowing significant French investment to pour into the Polish oil industry.<ref name=AustriaOil/> The Poles had convinced the French that since less than 25% of the ethnic Ukrainians were literate before the Great War and Ukrainians were novices in governing themselves, only the Poles, not the Ukrainians, would be able to administer eastern Galicia and its precious oil assets.<ref name=AustriaOil/>\n\nThe Ukrainians of the former eastern Galicia and the neighbouring province of [[Volhynia]] made up about 12% of the population of the [[Second Polish Republic]], and were its largest minority. As Polish government policies were unfriendly towards minorities, tensions between the Polish government and the Ukrainian population grew, eventually giving the rise to the militant underground [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{Main article|Subdivisions of the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria}}\nSoon the newly acquired Polish territories (see [[First Partition of Poland]]) which were known as Kreise (Voivodeship in Poland) were restructured in November 1773 into 59 Kreisdistriktes (Land districts), while kreises were abolished. Some former voivodeships were incorporated completely, while most of them only partially. Among them were the former voivodeships of Belz, Red-Ruthenian, Cracow, Lublin, Sandomierz, and Podolie. Also during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768\u201374)|Russo-Turkish War]] in 1769, the northwestern territory of [[Moldavia]] (renamed [[Bukovina]]) was occupied by the [[Russian Empire]] which [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca|ceded]] it in 1774 to the [[Austrian Empire]] as a \"token of appreciation\".\n\n===Major cities and towns===\n====Administrative division====\nThe Kingdom was split into numerous counties (powiat) which in 1914 were about 75.<ref>[http://www.ukrstor.com/ukrstor/galicia540_30.jpg Map of the Kingdom with its county division (Lenius, Brian. \"Genealogical Gazetteer of Galicia\" 2nd ed.

A small number were full farmers, but by far the overwhelming number (84%) had only smallholdings or no possessions.\n[[File:\u041f\u043e\u043a\u0443\u0442\u0442\u044f 1.jpg|thumb|People of East Galicia]]\n[[File:Zarubezhnaia Rus.jpg|thumb|Map of a region where Russians lived in the [[Austrian Empire]] \u2013 Galicia and Hungarian Russia ([[Carpathian Ruthenia]]) \u2013 by [[Dmitry Vergun]]]]\n\nNo country of the Austrian monarchy had such a varied ethnic mix as Galicia: [[Poles]], [[Ruthenians]], [[Germans]] ([[Galician Germans]]), [[Armenia]]ns, [[Galician Jews|Jews]], [[Hungarians]], [[Romani people]], [[Lipovans|Lipowaner]], etc. The Poles were mainly in the west, with the Ruthenians (Ukrainians) predominant in the eastern region (\"Ruthenia\"). \n\nThe Jews of Galicia had immigrated in the Middle Ages from Germany and mostly spoke [[Yiddish]] as their first language. German-speaking people were more commonly referred to as \"Saxons\" or \"Swabians\", even though most of them did not come from [[Saxony]] or [[Swabia]] (cf. [[Transylvanian Saxons]] and [[Danube Swabians]]). There were also some [[Mennonite]]s who mostly came originally from [[Switzerland]], but spoke a dialect of [[Palatine German language|Palatine German]] which is close to [[Pennsylvania German]].\n\nWith inhabitants who had a clear difference in language such as with the Saxons or the Roma identification was less problematic, but widespread multilingualness blurred the borders again. \n\nIt is however possible to make a clear distinction in religious denominations: the majority of the Poles were [[Roman Catholic Church|Latin Catholics]], while the Ruthenians were mostly [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholics]]. The Jews, who represented the third largest religious group, were mostly traditional in their religious observance which later developed into [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\nThe average life expectancy was 27 years for men and 28.5 years for women, as compared to 33 and 37 in [[Bohemia]], 39 and 41 in [[France]] and 40 and 42 in [[England]]. Also the quality of life was much lower.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} The yearly consumption of meat did not exceed {{convert|10|kg|0|abbr=on}} per capita, as compared to {{convert|24|kg|0|abbr=on}} in Hungary and 33 in Germany. This was mostly due to much lower average income.\n\nIn 1888 Galicia extended over {{convert|78550|km\u00b2|0|abbr=out}} and had a population of about 6.4 million people, including 4.8 million peasants (75% of the whole population). The population density, at 81 people per square kilometre, was higher than that of France (71 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>) or Germany. The population rose to 7.3 million in 1900 and to 8 million in 1910.<ref>{{cite web|title=Austria-Hungary: historical demographical data of the administrative division prior to 1918|url=http://www.populstat.info/Europe/austriop.htm|website=Populstat|accessdate=17 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Religions demographics<br />(per the December 1910 census)\n|-\n!

Its level of development was comparable to or higher than that of Russia and the Balkans, but well behind Western Europe.\n\nThe first detailed description of the economic situation of the region was prepared by Stanislaw Szczepanowski (1846\u20131900), a Polish lawyer, economist and chemist who in 1873 published the first version of his report titled ''N\u0119dza galicyjska w cyfrach'' (''The Galician Poverty in Numbers''). Based on his own experience as a worker in the [[India Office]], as well as his work on development of the oil industry in the region of [[Borys\u0142aw, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship|Borys\u0142aw]] and the official census data published by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] government, he described Galicia as one of the poorest regions in Europe.\n\nStatistics indicate the Galicia and Lodomeria was poorer than areas west of it. The average income per capita did not exceed 53 [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|Rhine guilders]] (RG), as compared to 91 RG in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], 100 in Hungary and more than 450 RG in England at that time. Also the taxes were relatively high and equalled to 9 Rhine guilders a year (c. 17% of yearly income), as compared to 5% in Prussia and 10% in England. Also the percentage of people with higher income was much lower than in other parts of the Monarchy and Europe: the luxury tax, paid by people whose yearly income exceeded 600 RG, was paid by 8 people in every 1,000 inhabitants, as compared to 28 in Bohemia and 99 in [[Lower Austria]]. Despite high taxation, the national debt of the Galician government exceeded 300 million RG at all times, that is approximately 60 RG per capita.\n\nAll in all, the region was used by the Austro-Hungarian government mostly as a reservoir of cheap workforce and recruits for the army,{{citation needed|date=August 2007}} as well as a buffer zone against Russia. It was not until early in the 20th century that heavy industry started to be developed, which would be comparable to much of Russia and the Balkans. Even then it was mostly connected to war production. The biggest state investments in the region were the railways and the fortresses in [[Przemy\u015bl, Poland|Przemy\u015bl]], Krak\u00f3w and other cities. Industrial development was mostly connected to the private oil industry started by [[Ignacy Lukasiewicz|Ignacy \u0141ukasiewicz]] and to the [[Wieliczka salt mine]]s, operational since at least the [[Middle Ages]].\n\n===Industry===\nIn 1880, industry in Galicia was at a low level. In 1857 Galicia had 102,189 persons or 2.2% of the population worked in industry. By 1870 that number had risen to 179,626, or 3.3% of the population.\n\n===Oil and natural gas industry===\n{{See also|The Petroleum Trail}}\n[[File:Galicia 1897 1.jpg|thumb|330px|Rail lines of Galicia before 1897]]\nNear [[Drohobych]] and [[Boryslav]] in Galicia, significant oil reserves were [https://web.archive.org/web/20161006104622/http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/drohobycz/maps/Map_oilfields.asp discovered and developed] during the mid 19th and early 20th centuries.<ref name=DrohobychOil>{{cite web | last1 = Schatzker | first1 = Valerie | last2 = Erdheim | first2 = Claudia | last3 = Sharontitle | first3 = Alexander | title = Petroleum in Galicia | url = http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/drohobycz/history/petroleum.asp | publisher = Drohobycz Administrative District: History | accessdate = April 20, 2016 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160410201456/http://kehilalinks.jewishgen.org/drohobycz/history/petroleum.asp | archivedate = April 10, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=CarpathianOil>{{cite book | last1= Golonka | first1 = Jan | last2 = Picha | first2 = Frank J. | title = The Carpathians and Their Foreland: Geology and Hydrocarbon Resources | publisher = American Association of Petroleum Geologists (AAPG) | date = 2006 | isbn = 9780891813651}}</ref> The first European attempt to drill for oil was in [[B\u00f3brka, Krosno County|B\u00f3brka]] in western Galicia in 1854.<ref name=DrohobychOil/><ref name=CarpathianOil/> By 1867, a well at [[Kl\u0119czany, Nowy S\u0105cz County|Kleczany]], in Western Galicia, was drilled using steam to about 200 meters.<ref name=DrohobychOil/><ref name=CarpathianOil/> On December 31, 1872, a [[Galician Transversal Railway|railway line]] linking Borys\u0142aw (now Boryslav) with the nearby city of Drohobycz (now Drohobych) was opened.

He sat out his entire fifth season, in [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301]], due to rehabilitation from off-season surgery on his right knee. After seven seasons with the Nets, Kittles was traded to the Clippers in a salary purge. After one injury-riddled year with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]], Kittles retired from the NBA. Kittles completed an MBA at Villanova University's School of Business.<ref name=\"Princeton\" />\n\nHe holds the Villanova University record for most points scored, with 2,243, was inducted into the team's Hall of Fame and had his #30 retired by the school. <ref>https://villanova.com/sports/2018/6/18/trads-13-retired-players-html.aspx</ref> Kittles is a member of [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] fraternity.\n\n\n==High School career==\n\nST. AUGUSTINE HIGH SCHOOL - New Orleans, LA.\nKittles was one of the most heralded basketball talents to ever come out of New Orleans. He led St. Augustine to a 66-5 record in his final two seasons while earning first-team all-metro and all-state honors for coach Bernard Griffith. As a junior, Kittles led the Purple Knights to the 1991 state finals. As a senior he averaged 22.5 ppg for St. Aug as they notched a 32-3 record and cruised to a 67-50 victory over John Ehret in the 1992 Class 5A state championship game. <ref>https://allstatesugarbowl.org/classic/kerry-kittles-hall-of-fame</ref> He was named Louisiana Mr. Basketball of 1992. <ref>https://vault.si.com/vault/1995/10/24/kerry-kittles</ref>\n\nKittles surprised Louisiana basketball fans by going out of state, accepting Rollie Massimino's offer to play at Villanova. \"I picked Villanova because it fit all of my criteria,\" he said. \"It was a smaller institution, it was a Catholic school, its basketball games were on television and I had the opportunity to play. But the biggest factor was its graduation rate.\"<ref>http://www.hoyabasketball.com/features/40for40/k_kittles.htm</ref>\n\nHowever Villanova had to re-confirm Kittles on his commitment to the program once coach Rollie Massimino left for UNLV before his freshman year.
