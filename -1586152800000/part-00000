He is currently signed to [[WWE]].\n\nFoley worked for many wrestling promotions, including the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW), [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA), and [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA), as well as numerous promotions in [[Japan]]. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest wrestlers in the history of WWE,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifetimetv.co.uk/biography/biography-mick-foley|title=Mick Foley: Biography|publisher=[[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]]|access-date=September 7, 2016|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918224058/http://www.lifetimetv.co.uk/biography/biography-mick-foley|archivedate=September 18, 2015}}</ref> and participated in the main event of [[WrestleMania]] in [[WrestleMania XV|1999]] and [[WrestleMania 2000|2000]] (as a [[Referee (professional wrestling)#Special referees|special guest referee]] in the former). He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] class of [[WWE Hall of Fame (2013)|2013]].\n\nFoley has wrestled under his real name and various personas. His main persona during his time in WCW and ECW from 1991 to 1996 was '''Cactus Jack''', a bloodthirsty and uncompromisingly physical brawler from [[Truth or Consequences, New Mexico]] who wore cowboy boots and often wrestled with sharp and/or solid metallic objects, such as barbed wire, thumbtacks, or metal trashcans. When Foley got to the WWF in 1996, he debuted the persona known as '''Mankind''', a masked, mentally deranged loner who stuffed a smelly gym sock in his opponents' mouths and spent his spare time dwelling in boiler rooms; and later Foley debuted '''Dude Love''', a relaxed, fun-loving, jive-talking, tie-dyed shirt-wearing hippie. These personas were known as the \"Three Faces of Foley\", and Cactus Jack made his debut in the WWF in 1997. He is a four-time [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]] (three [[WWE Championship|WWF Championships]] and one [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]]), an 11-time [[World tag team championship|world tag team champion]] (eight [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championships]], two [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]]s and one [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]]), a one-time [[TNA King of the Mountain Championship|TNA Legends Champion]], and the inaugural [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Champion]]. Foley's dedicated and physical style of wrestling led him to often participate in violent and brutal matches that involved him taking dangerous bumps and putting his body through a considerable physical toll, and would sometimes cause him or his opponents to bleed copiously, earning him the moniker \"The Hardcore Legend\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/mick-foleys-12-wildest-matches|title=Dirty dozen: Mick Foley's 12 wildest ngmatches|website=WWE.com}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nMichael Francis Foley<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://stars.ign.com/objects/142/14208780_biography.html|title=Mick Foley Biography|accessdate=May 20, 2008 |publisher=[[IGN]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904210033/http://stars.ign.com/objects/142/14208780_biography.html|archivedate=September 4, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/mick-foley.html|title=Mick Foley's profile|accessdate=April 14, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> was born in [[Bloomington, Indiana]],<ref name=\"IGN\"/> on June 7, 1965.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/><ref name=\"IGN\"/> He is of Irish descent,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pscp.tv/JOEdotie/1zqJVRoaBMDJB?t=120|title=JOE.ie @JOEdotie|first=Twitter|last=Inc|website=Periscope}}</ref> and has an older brother named John. Shortly after his birth, he moved with his family to the [[Long Island]] town of [[Setauket-East Setauket, New York|East Setauket, New York]] about 40 miles east of [[New York City]], where he attended [[Ward Melville High School]]. At school, he [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestled]] and played [[lacrosse]],<ref name=\"IGN\"/><ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 11\u201312, 19</ref> and was a classmate and wrestling teammate of actor [[Kevin James]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hobotrashcan.com/interviews/mickfoley3.php|title=One on One with Mick Foley (2007)|first=Joel|last= Murphy|publisher=HoboTrashcan.com| accessdate=March 30, 2007|date=March 2007}}</ref> While a student at [[State University of New York at Cortland]], Foley hitchhiked to [[Madison Square Garden]] to see his favorite wrestler, [[Jimmy Snuka]], in a steel cage match against [[Don Muraco]].<ref name=WWEProfileMickFoley>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wwealumni/mickfoley|title=Mick Foley |publisher=WWE Alumni profile, [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=October 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name=mf34/> He has said that Snuka's flying body splash from the top of the cage inspired him to pursue a career in pro wrestling.<ref name=WWEProfileMickFoley/><ref name=mf34>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 33\u201334</ref> He had a seat close to the front row and is visible on the video of the event.<ref name=mf34/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://s271.photobucket.com/user/jklmn_2008/media/FoleyMSG.jpg.html|title=Photo by Alec Settee|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n=== Training and early career (1983\u20131991) ===\n[[File:Mick Foley.jpg|thumb|upright|Foley as Cactus Jack]]\nMick Foley formally trained at [[Dominic DeNucci]]'s wrestling school in [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]], driving several hours weekly from his college campus in [[Cortland, New York]], and debuted in 1983.<ref name=\"HAND\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Foley|first1=Mick|title=Mick Foley - 30 YEARS AGO TODAY: MY FIRST MATCH EVER...|url=https://www.facebook.com/RealMickFoley/photos/a.150133228350157.28288.126269440736536/1326472897382845/?type=3&permPage=1|website=facebook.com|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}</ref> In addition to appearing on DeNucci's cards, Foley and several other students also took part in some [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#squash|squash]] matches as [[Job (professional wrestling)#jobbers|jobbers]] for [[WWE|WWF]] TV tapings of ''[[Prime Time Wrestling]]'' and ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'', where Foley wrestled under the names Jack Foley and Nick Foley. In one of these matches (the very first episode of Superstars), Foley and [[Les Thornton]] (another jobber) faced the [[British Bulldogs]], during which the [[Dynamite Kid]] (who had a long earned reputation as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#stiff|stiff]] worker in the ring) clotheslined Foley with such force that he was unable to eat solid food for several weeks.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 82\u201385</ref> During these squash matches, Foley also faced other top-level talent at the time, such as [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules Hernandez]]. His run would not last long, as he had not signed a contract with the promotion at the time. During this run, he was also billed from different hometowns and at different weights.\n\nAfter several years of wrestling in the [[independent circuit]], Foley began receiving offers from various regional promotions, including [[Bill Watts]]' [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF).<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 91\u201393</ref> He joined the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]-based [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA) as Cactus Jack Manson, where he teamed with Gary Young as part of the [[Stud Stable]].<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 117</ref> Cactus and Young briefly held the CWA tag titles in late 1988.<ref name=SlamFoleyBio>{{cite web|last=Milner|first=John|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/foley.html|title=Mick Foley Profile|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=March 20, 2006|date=November 18, 2004}}</ref> On November 20, Foley left CWA for Texas-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]].\n\nIn [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW), Cactus Jack, billed as Cactus Jack Manson, was a major part of [[Skandor Akbar]]'s stable. (The addition of \"Manson\" to Foley's name, due to its implied connection to [[Charles Manson]], made him uncomfortable.)<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 131, 146</ref> Foley also won several titles, including the company's light heavyweight and tag team titles before leaving the company, losing his last match to [[Eric Embry]] in nine seconds. He then briefly competed in Alabama's Continental Wrestling Federation before completing a brief stint with [[World Championship Wrestling]]. For much of his time there, he would team with jobbers.  When the jobber would lose the match for the team, Cactus Jack would attack his partner, throw them out of the ring, and deliver his infamous ring apron flying elbow drop onto the concrete floor. One notable occasion he did this was in [[Gainesville, Georgia]] against the rising tag team of brothers [[Rick Steiner|Rick]] and [[Scott Steiner]]- two of the stiffest workers in wrestling at the time. Cactus was partnered with a one-time jobber named Rick Fargo, and after taking brutal bumps from both Steiner brothers and losing the match, Cactus then began fighting with Fargo, and then jumped nearly 12 feet off the apron to elbow Fargo in the abdomen, per Kevin Sullivan\u2019s instructions. Lead WCW booker [[Ric Flair]], Sullivan and other WCW executives were impressed with this to the point that they offered Foley a contract, and Foley finally found some financial stability after years of hardship. His biggest match at the time was a few weeks later against [[Mil M\u00e1scaras]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout]]'', where he took a particularly brutal bump backwards off the 3-foot high apron and landed on the concrete floor, with his head and back taking the impact.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 169</ref> It was during this period that Foley was involved in a car accident that resulted in the loss of his two front teeth, adding to the distinctive look for which he is famous.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 164\u2013166</ref> Following the short stint with WCW, Foley then signed with [[Herb Abrams]]'s [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]].<ref name=SlamFoleyBio/><ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 183</ref> In UWF, Foley teamed with [[Bob Orton, Jr.|Bob Orton]] to feud with [[Don Muraco]], [[Sunny Beach (wrestler)|Sunny Beach]], and [[Brian Blair]].\n\nHe soon left UWF for [[Professional wrestling promotion|Tri-State Wrestling]] (a forerunner to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]),<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 192</ref> whose high-impact and violent wrestling style fit Foley well. On one night, known as Tri-State's Summer Sizzler 1991, Cactus Jack and [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]] had three matches in one night: Cactus won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]], lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Stretcher match]], and then fought to a double [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#steel Cage match|Steel Cage match]].<ref name=mf194>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 194\u2013195</ref> These matches caught the attention of [[World Championship Wrestling]] promoters, in large part due to widespread photo circulation. In 1991, after a brief stint working in the [[Global Wrestling Federation]], Foley joined WCW full-time.<ref name=SlamFoleyBio/><ref name=mf194/>\n\n=== World Championship Wrestling===\n==== Early years (1991\u20131993) ====\nOn September 5, 1991, Cactus Jack debuted as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and attacked [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 201</ref> After feuds with [[Van Hammer]] and [[Abdullah the Butcher]], Cactus Jack faced Sting, then WCW World Heavyweight Champion, in a non-title Falls Count Anywhere match at [[Beach Blast (1992)|Beach Blast]] in 1992, which Sting won.<ref name=mf223>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 223</ref> For a long time, Foley considered this the best match he ever worked.<ref name=mf223/> Unlike Jack's first stint in WCW, where his personality was quieter, he was now outwardly maniacal; laughing hysterically, shrieking into the air while choking his opponents and yelling his signature catchphrase \"Bang-Bang!\".\n\nAfter spending a year and a half with WCW as a heel, Cactus Jack transitioned into a fan favorite after engaging in a feud with Paul Orndorff, Harley Race and Big Van Vader. Jack and Orndorff wrestled each other in a match for a spot on WCW World Heavyweight Champion Vader's team at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXII]]''. After the match, Race and Orndorff beat up Jack. At the following Clash of Champions event, Cactus Jack helped Sting's team win the match. He engaged in a feud with Orndorff, winning a falls-count-anywhere match against Orndorff at [[SuperBrawl III]]. He then moved on to face Big Van Vader.\n\n==== Feud with Vader (1993\u20131994) ====\nCactus Jack wrestled [[Big Van Vader]] on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out, but being severely beaten in the process. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot to sell a storyline injury. Harley Race removed the protective mats at ringside and Vader [[powerbomb]]ed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 243\u2013244</ref> While Foley was away, WCW ran an [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a [[Farce|farcical]] comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia.<ref name=mf248>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 248\u2013250</ref> Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignettes]] that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in ''Have a Nice Day'' that they were the brainchild of WCW executives who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved. The angle was awarded \"Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic\" by the esteemed [[Dave Meltzer|Wrestling Newsletter Observer]].<ref name=mf248/>\n\nIn one of WCW's most brutal matches of all time, Cactus faced Vader in a [[professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Texas Death match]] at [[Halloween Havoc (1993)|Halloween Havoc]].<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 256</ref> Race won the match for Vader by using a stun gun on Cactus, knocking him out. The level of violence involved in this feud caused WCW to refuse to book Cactus Jack against Vader on a pay-per-view again. On March 16, 1994, during a WCW European tour, Foley and Big Van Vader had one of the most infamous matches in wrestling history in [[Munich]], Germany. Foley began a hangman\u2014a planned move where a wrestler's head is tangled between the top two ring ropes. Neither wrestler was aware that the ring ropes had been drawn extra tight before the event, and Foley was barely able to move. When Foley finally freed himself from the ropes and fell out of the ring, his ears were badly split at the back. When Foley re-entered the ring the two wrestlers began trading blows. During this time, Vader reached up and grabbed Foley's right ear, and ripped it off. The two men continued wrestling as the referee picked up the ear and gave it to the ring announcer. Vader claimed for years after that the ear had come off during the botched Hangman maneuver, however in a WWE Network video, Vader admits that after seeing footage that he had indeed removed Foley's ear. Cactus Jack and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] were scheduled to win the tag team titles at [[Slamboree (1994)|Slamboree]] in 1994.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 272</ref> Foley had to choose between reattaching his ear or wrestling in the pay-per-view and winning the titles. Foley chose to wrestle and won his only championship in WCW. Later on, Foley was frustrated by WCW and the company\u2019s new head [[Eric Bischoff]]\u2019s reluctance to work a storyline with Vader around losing his ear.\n\nWCW also shared a brief co-promotion with ECW during this time in which Foley represented WCW on ECW television as the WCW Tag Team champion, facing [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] at [[Hostile City Showdown]] on June 24, 1994. During a promo, Foley spat on his Tag Team title belt and threw it to the ground to appeal to the hardcore fans who frowned upon the mainstream promotions.\n\n=== NWA Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994\u20131996) ===\nCactus Jack's first appearance for the NWA-affiliated [[Eastern Championship Wrestling]] came on the May 31, 1994 episode, with Cactus revealed as Sabu's opponent for June 24 at the ECW Arena in Philadelphia. After being part of a talent exchange between ECW & WCW, Foley brought his WCW tag team title belt and spit on it for a recorded ECW tv segment. Foley continued with ECW and began a feud with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]. Foley then began working the ECW tag team division on teams with [[Terry Funk]], [[Mikey Whipwreck]], and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]]. He had two [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]] reigns with Whipwreck while in ECW.<ref name=ECWtag>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ecw/ecw-t.html|title=ECW World Tag Team Title history with his son alex foley|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter the stints in Smokey Mountain Wrestling and Japan noted below, Foley then returned to ECW to have a series of violent encounters with the Sandman, while challenging him and claiming that he had never been beaten in a falls count anywhere match. He then started to team with [[Tommy Dreamer]]. According to Heyman, Hardcore style differentiated Foley from other traditional wrestlers, so in ECW, Foley was right at home. After seeing a sign in the audience one night that said \"Cane Dewey\" a reference to Foley's real-life son, Foley began a [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] where he criticized hardcore wrestling and sought to renounce his status as a hardcore wrestling icon and used a very technical, slow wrestling as a way to punish the audience.<ref name=\"MondayNightWars\" >{{cite DVD|title=Monday Night War S01 E05:Have a Nice Day!|publisher=WWE|}}</ref> He said that he was on a mission to save his partner from making the mistake of trying to please bloodthirsty fans. The mismatched partnership lasted until August 5, 1995, when Cactus turned on Dreamer when they were teaming with [[The Pitbulls]] against Raven, [[Stevie Richards]] and [[The Dudley Brothers]] ([[Dudley Dudley (wrestler)|Dudley Dudley]] and [[Big Dick Dudley]]).  Cactus Jack DDT'ed his partner and joined Raven's Nest, as he wished to serve [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]'s \"higher purpose\". He remained one of Raven's top henchmen for the remainder of his time in ECW. On August 28, Cactus beat the previously undefeated [[911 (wrestler)|911]]. As part of Foley's heel [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], he began praising WWF and WCW on ECW television, which angered ECW fans. Their anger intensified once word began to spread that Foley was leaving to join the WWF (In ''Have a Nice Day'', Foley recounted an incident where he asked an ECW roadie to sell T-shirts for him at an event held in a Queens, New York venue where he had been popular even as a heel; the man came back after being spat upon numerous times by angry fans, who made him fear for his life<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', '''p.??'''</ref>). Even when he tried to give sincere good-byes to the fans, Cactus Jack was met with chants of \"You sold out\" by the ECW fanbase everywhere he went. Cactus was booked to face WWF hater [[Shane Douglas]], who won after he handcuffed Cactus and then hit him with no less than '''''ten''''' consecutive plastic chair shots and when he put Jack into a [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|figure four leglock]], this allowed Mikey Whipwreck to get into the arena and land one last very hard chair shot to Cactus's face, knocking him unconscious. Foley's last ECW match was against Whipwreck on March 9, 1996, and he recounts that he was not looking forward to it due to the increasingly hostile reactions he got even when he wasn't in character. The ECW fans, who knew that this was Foley's last match, finally returned his affection. They cheered him throughout the match and chanted, \"Please don't go!\". After the match, Foley told the audience that their reaction made everything worthwhile and made his exit by dancing with [[Stevie Richards]] and [[The Blue Meanie]] to [[Frank Sinatra]]'s song \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\". Foley has said that this exit was his favorite moment in wrestling.<ref name=SlamFoleyBio/><ref>Mick Foley, ''Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses: A Life in Wrestling''</ref>\n\n=== Smoky Mountain Wrestling and Japan (1994\u20131996)===\nAt the tail end of 1994, Foley joined [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW) as Cactus Jack, causing [[Balls Mahoney|Boo Bradley]] to lose the [[SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship]]. He often teamed with [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]] to feud with Bradley and [[Chris Candido]]. Cactus Jack then began a crusade to rid Bradley of his valet [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Tamara Fytch]]. He ignited a feud between Candido and Bradley when he accused Candido of having sexual relations with Fytch. (Ironically, Candido and Fytch were a couple in real life). Cactus Jack left SMW before the feud was resolved.\n\nIn 1995, Foley went to Japan and wrestled in [[International Wrestling Association of Japan]] (IWA Japan), where he engaged in feuds with Terry Funk and Shoji Nakamaki. During his brief stint in Japan Foley had the nickname \"Tsunami Stopper.\" Foley, however, soon returned to ECW to feud with [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]]. Funk returned to team up with Sandman, and during a particularly violent spot, the pair hit Cactus with a [[Shinai|kendo stick]] forty-six times in a barbed wire rope match. Cactus Jack then defeated Funk at Hostile City Showdown 1995. Later, he fought Sandman for the ECW championship. During the match, Cactus Jack knocked Sandman unconscious and was declared the winner. Referee [[Bill Alfonso]], however, reversed his decision because the title cannot change hands by knockout.\n\nReturning to the IWA, Cactus Jack began a feud with [[Michael Kirchner|Leatherface]], whom he had betrayed during a tag team match. Foley also continued to wrestle in independent circuits, winning championships on the Ozark Mountain and [[Steel City Wrestling|Steel City]] circuits. On August 20, 1995, IWA organized a [[IWA Kawasaki Dream#1995 King of the Death Match Tournament|King of the Death Match]] tournament at their [[IWA Kawasaki Dream|Kawasaki Dream]] event, which featured some of the bloodiest, most violent and most brutal matches of Foley's career. Each level of the tournament featured a new and deadly [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]: Cactus Jack's first-round during the day was a barbed-wire baseball bat, thumbtack deathmatch, in which he defeated Terry Gordy; the second round was a barbed-wire board, bed of nails match where Cactus Jack defeated Shoji Nakamaki. The final, at night against Terry Funk, was a barbed-wire rope, barbed-wire and [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] board, time-bomb deathmatch, which Cactus Jack won with help from [[Tiger Jeet Singh]]. After the match, both men were covered in blood, ravaged by flesh cuts from the wire and burned by the C4 explosions. Foley later said that he only received $300 for the entire night,<ref>''Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses: A Life in Wrestling'' DVD</ref> but in 2010 he wrote that, \"looking back that match in Honjo is probably the performance I'm proudest of.\"<ref name=\"Slate\" /> After the tournament, Foley's right arm had second-degree burns from the C-4 explosions from the match with Funk and his arm smelt of explosive chemicals. After a 14-hour flight from [[Tokyo]]'s [[Narita Airport]] to [[JFK Airport]] his father picked him up from the airport to take him back to his Long Island home, and immediately smelt something unusual. When Foley got home, his father and wife kept asking him about the awful smell, but he would not say anything, not wanting them to worry. After his father left, his wife persisted, so he revealed the burns to her. Later on, he teamed with [[Tracy Smothers]] for a quick run with the IWA tag team titles.\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation/WWF===\n==== Three faces of Foley (1996\u20131998) ====\nIn 1996, at the persistence of [[Jim Ross]], whom Foley had known in his days in WCW, WWF head [[Vince McMahon]] brought on Foley, and he signed a contract with WWF and this time, the WWF did not use Foley as \"[[Job (professional wrestling)|enhancement talent]]\". McMahon was not a fan of Cactus Jack and wanted to cover up Foley's face, so he was shown several designs for a new heel character- a man with a leather mask and chains, called '''Mason the Mutilator'''. However, WWF decided that it was too dark and only left the mask, and although interested in the concept of the character, Foley did not like the name, so he came up with the name '''Mankind''', which company head [[Vince McMahon]] liked and approved.<ref name=\"FoleyDVD\">{{cite AV media|date=May 3, 2013|title=Mick Foley: For All Mankind|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}</ref> Foley arrived in the WWF in 1996 debuting a [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that was perhaps his most famous personality: Mankind was a mentally deranged schizophrenic who constantly squealed (even throughout his matches), shrieked ''\"Mommy!\"'', spoke to a rat named George, enjoyed pain, physically abused himself (such as by pulling out his hair) and wore a mask; Mankind's finishing move was the [[professional wrestling hold#mandible claw|Mandible Claw]] nerve hold, which involved sticking his ring and middle fingers in his opponent's mouth. His catchphrase was \"Have a nice day!\" and he lived in [[Mechanical room|boiler rooms]]; hence, his specialty match, the [[Professional wrestling match types#Boiler Room Brawl|Boiler Room Brawl]].<ref name=\"IGN\"/> This specific match was a chaotic, dangerous and sometimes violent match that took place inside an arena's mechanical/boiler room, with all sorts of exposed metal piping with large bolts, concrete flooring and solid electrical equipment everywhere, and it was a no disqualification match, so foreign objects were allowed, and the match's objective was to escape the boiler room first.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://wrestlingnews.co/columns/who-really-gets-credit-for-creating-the-boiler-room-brawl/ |title = Who really gets credit for creating the Boiler Room Brawl?|date = August 15, 2017 |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn the April 1, 1996, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' in [[San Bernardino, California]], the day after [[WrestleMania XII]], Mankind debuted on TV and defeated [[Hardcore Holly|Bob \u201cSpark Plug\u201d Holly]], quickly moving into a feud with [[The Undertaker]]. The creatively inclined and dedicated Foley initially would prepare for playing Mankind by researching the character, often spending the night in the respective arena's boiler room and sometimes under the wrestling ring for the first few months, but after that he could get into character almost instantly. The two then began interfering in the other's matches until they were booked in the first-ever Boiler Room Brawl, and in addition to escaping the arena's boiler room, the combatant also had to reach the ring and take the urn from Paul Bearer. After 30 minutes of brawling in the boiler room, the backstage corridors and the entrance ramp, and both men taking some bumps involving metal trash cans, tables, ladders, metal poles, hot coffee and the exposed concrete floor, The Undertaker appeared to have won, but Paul Bearer refused to hand him the urn, allowing Mankind to win, thus (for the time being) ending the relationship between Paul and The Undertaker. While Mankind was managed by Paul Bearer, he referred to him as \"Uncle Paul\". Mankind then became the number one contender to face the then WWF Champion [[Shawn Michaels]] at [[In Your House 10: Mind Games|In Your House: Mind Games]]. Michaels won by disqualification via interference by [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] and The Undertaker.\n\nThe Mankind and Undertaker rivalry continued with the first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Buried Alive match|Buried Alive match]] at [[In Your House 11: Buried Alive|In Your House: Buried Alive]]. Undertaker won the match, but Paul Bearer, the [[Terry Gordy|Executioner]], Mankind and other heels attacked The Undertaker and buried him alive. Afterward, The Undertaker challenged Mankind to a match at [[Survivor Series (1996)|Survivor Series]], which the Undertaker won. The feud continued after another match at [[In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker|In Your House: Revenge of the Taker]] for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which Undertaker had won at [[WrestleMania 13]]. Undertaker won the match and Bearer took a leave of absence, continuing the feud. [[Jim Ross]] then began conducting a series of interviews with Mankind. During the interviews, Ross brought up the topic of Foley's home videos and the hippie-inspired character he played in them, Dude Love, as well as his tormented journey in wrestling. The interviews also affected the fans, who began cheering Mankind, turning him into a face.\n\nAround this time, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and Shawn Michaels won the WWF Tag Team Championships from [[Owen Hart]] and [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]], but Michaels was injured and could no longer compete. Mankind tried to replace him, but Austin said he wanted \"nothing to do with a freak\" and resigned himself to facing Hart and the Bulldog alone the next week. Halfway into the match, however, Foley debuted a new persona known as Dude Love, who helped Austin take the victory, becoming the new Tag Team Champions.<ref name=\"Worldtag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwe/wwf-t.html|title=WWWF/WWF/WWE World Tag Team Title history|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com}}</ref> Austin and Foley vacated their tag team titles when Austin suffered a neck injury in a match at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. Dude Love feuded with [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]], as the two competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]]. One of Foley's most memorable vignettes aired before the match began, in which Dude Love and Mankind discussed who should wrestle the upcoming match. Eventually, \"they\" decided that it should be Cactus Jack, and Foley's old character made his WWF debut. Cactus Jack won the match with a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] through a table. Shortly thereafter, ECW's [[Terry Funk]] joined the WWF as Chainsaw Charlie. At the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998 Royal Rumble]], Foley participated under all three personas, Cactus Jack (1st entry), Mankind (16th), and Dude Love (28th). Charlie and Jack defeated [[the New Age Outlaws]] at [[WrestleMania XIV]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#dumpster match|Dumpster match]] to win the tag team titles (which was originally supposed to be a barbed-wire rope match- but this very often violent and bloody match was scrapped due to the high profile appearance of [[Mike Tyson]] taking part at the event). The next night, however, [[Vince McMahon]] stripped them of the belts and scheduled a rematch in a steel cage, which the Outlaws won with help from their new allies, [[D-Generation X]]. On April 6, 1998, Foley turned heel when Cactus Jack explained the fans would not see him anymore because they did not appreciate him and only cared about Stone Cold Steve Austin. [[Vince McMahon]] explained to Austin the next week that he would face a \"mystery\" opponent at [[Unforgiven: In Your House|Unforgiven]]. That opponent turned out to be Dude Love, who won the match by disqualification, meaning that Austin retained the title. McMahon, displeased with the outcome, required Foley to prove he deserved another shot at Austin's title with a number one contenders match against his former partner, Terry Funk. The match was both the WWF's first-ever \"[[Hardcore wrestling|Hardcore match]]\" and the first time that Foley wrestled under his name. Foley won, and after the match, a proud McMahon came out to Dude Love's music and presented Foley with the Dude Love costume. At [[Over the Edge: In Your House|Over the Edge]], Dude Love took on Austin for the title. McMahon designated his subordinates [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] as the timekeeper and ring announcer, and made himself the special referee. The Undertaker, however, came to ringside to ensure McMahon called the match fairly, and with his presence, Dude Love lost the match and was \"fired\" by McMahon on the June 1 episode of ''Raw''.\n\nOn that same episode of ''Raw'', Foley reverted to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked shirt with a loose necktie and resumed his feud with The Undertaker. At [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]] in Pittsburgh\u2019s [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] on June 28, the two performed in the [[the Undertaker vs. Mankind|third]] [[Hell in a Cell match]], which became one of most notable matches in professional wrestling history. Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential [[Bump (professional wrestling)|bumps]]- the first being tossed off the top of the 16 foot high Cell by The Undertaker, crashing through the wooden Spanish announcer's table and landing on the arena's concrete floor. Barely five minutes after the first bump Foley, with a separated shoulder climbed back up to the top of the Cell after Terry Funk and others tried to stop him, and the second bump, which was an unplanned botch- The Undertaker Chokeslammed Foley, and the fenced panel Foley landed on broke and gave way, so Foley fell 13 feet and landed on the ring mat. Mankind lost the match to conclude their storyline.\n\n==== WWF Champion (1998\u20132000) ====\n{{main|The Rock 'n' Sock Connection}}\nAlthough conventional wisdom holds that the Hell in a Cell match was responsible for Foley's rise to main event status, live television crowds did not initially get behind Mankind because of the match.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Following a couple of months of teaming with [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] who together won the WWF Tag Team Championship on two separate occasions and various feuds with Kane, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Undertaker, Foley decided that crowds might respond better if Mankind were more of a comedy character, and so he abandoned the tortured soul characteristics and became more of a goofy, broken down oaf. He began the transition into this character following [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]] in 1998 after Kane turned on him and the two lost the tag team championships.\n\nThe following month, Foley began an angle with Vince McMahon, with Mankind trying to be a friend to the hated Mr. McMahon. On the October 5 episode of ''Raw'', while McMahon was in a hospital nursing wounds suffered at the hands of The Undertaker and Kane, Mankind arrived with a female clown called Yurple in an attempt to cheer him up. Having succeeded only in irritating McMahon, Mankind then took a sock off his foot to create a sock puppet named '''\"Mr. Socko\"'''. Intended to be a one-time joke, Socko became an overnight sensation. Mankind began putting the sock on his hand before applying his finisher, the [[professional wrestling hold#mandible claw|Mandible Claw]], stuffing a smelly sock in the mouths of opposing wrestlers. The sweat sock became massively popular with the fans, mainly because it was marketed (mostly by [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry \"The King\" Lawler]] during the events) as being a dirty, smelly, sweaty, repulsive, and vile sock. McMahon manipulated Mankind, who saw the WWF owner as a father figure, into doing his bidding. McMahon created the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Championship]] and awarded it to Mankind, making him the first-ever champion of the hardcore division. Mankind was then pushed as the favorite to win the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]] at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], as McMahon appeared to be manipulating the tournament so that Mankind would win. He and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] both reached the finals, where McMahon turned on Mankind. As The Rock placed Mankind in the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]], McMahon ordered the timekeeper to ring the bell even though Mankind did not submit, a reference to the [[Montreal Screwjob]] from the year before. As a result of Survivor Series, Mankind officially turned face, while The Rock turned heel and became the crown jewel in McMahon's new [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]] faction.\n\nAfter weeks of trying to get his hands on McMahon's new faction, the [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]], Mankind received a title shot against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. Mankind won the match by using his mandible claw hold (with the 'Mr. Socko' prop on his hand) and the referee declared The Rock had become unresponsive. But McMahon overruled the title change because Mankind didn't keep his pre-match promise to make The Rock submit. After several weeks of going after the Corporation, Mankind defeated The Rock to win his first WWF Championship on December 29 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. The taped show was broadcast on January 4, 1999, so that is the date WWE recognizes as beginning the title run. Having title changes on broadcast television rather than pay-per-view was uncommon in professional wrestling, but because of the [[Monday Night Wars#1997\u20131999: Attitude Era|Monday Night Wars]], TV ratings became more important. The head of rival promotion WCW [[Eric Bischoff]], attempting to take advantage of the fact that their show ''Monday Nitro'' aired live while Mankind's title victory was taped the week before, had announcer [[Tony Schiavone]] reveal the ending of the Mankind-Rock match before it aired. He then added sarcastically, \"That'll put a lot of butts in the seats.\" The move backfired for WCW, as [[Nielsen ratings]] showed that Raw won the ratings battle that night, despite the [[The Fingerpoke of Doom|Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash main event]] which led to the reformation of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. Foley said that the ratings indicate that large numbers of viewers switched from ''Nitro'' to ''Raw'' to see him win the title and took great personal pride from this.\n\nMankind lost the WWF Championship to The Rock in an [[\"I Quit\" match]] at [[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]] at the [[Arrowhead Pond]] in [[Anaheim, California]] near [[Los Angeles]], in what is regarded as one of the company's most brutal matches. During the match, Foley took several violent and dangerous bumps from [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] all over the arena, including repeated steel chair shots to the head and a fall from the stands onto solid electrical objects, which sparked upon impact. Although steel chair shots to the head were commonplace in the Attitude Era, the most a wrestler would take in a single ten-minute match was two, or sometimes three, with their hands in front of their head to ease the blow and lessen a chance of a concussion- but Foley had taken '''''eleven''''' in the span of two and a half minutes- all unprotected because he had been handcuffed just before The Rock began his repeated onslaught. Foley was originally supposed to take five chair shots to the head with the final match-ending shot being two-thirds up the entrance ramp, but after the fifth shot, Foley was still at ringside, and even after Foley signaled to The Rock to hit him in the back, The Rock decided to keep to the match's brutal tone based on Foley's previous calling of similar shots on the spot, and he hit Foley six more times in the head until they got to the two-thirds mark. This match is featured in Barry Blaustein's documentary ''[[Beyond the Mat]]'', which shows the impact the match had on Foley, his family and even the rest of the audience at ringside, and at one point Foley's five-year-old daughter Noelle cried and screamed in horror, believing her father was dying as The Rock pummeled Foley with repeated chair shots. The match got to a point that people sitting in the front of the audience screamed and signalled at the referee and The Rock to stop the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadspin.com/twenty-years-ago-the-rock-beat-mick-foley-about-the-he-1832057103|title=Twenty Years Ago, The Rock Beat Mick Foley About The Head And It Was Fucked Up|accessdate=August 9, 2019 |author=David Bixenspan |url-status=live}}</ref> The match ended after Mankind lost consciousness, and The Rock's allies played a recording of Mankind saying \"I Quit\" from an earlier interview he did with Shane McMahon. \n\nMankind won the title back in a rematch on Halftime Heat, which aired during halftime of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], in the WWF's first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Empty Arena match|Empty Arena match]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]] on January 31. After 20 minutes of brawling in the ring, the empty grandstands, a kitchen, the arena's hallways, an office, and the catering hall, Mankind used a [[forklift]] to pin The Rock in a basement loading area. The two then competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types|Last Man Standing match]] at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]], which ended without a winner, meaning that Mankind retained the title. The next night, Mr. McMahon booked a ladder match for the championship, which The Rock won with help from [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]]. Mankind would go on to [[WrestleMania XV|WrestleMania]] to defeat The Big Show and again at [[Backlash (1999)|Backlash]] a month later in a violent and brutal Boiler Room Brawl (the first in the WWF since July 1996), where the objective of the match had been simplified from the 1996 match to just escape the boiler room. Shortly after Big Show would team with Mankind, Test and Shamrock to take on the Corporation at Over The Edge. Later in the year, Foley and The Rock patched up their friendship and teamed up to form a comedy team called [[the Rock 'n' Sock Connection]], becoming one of the most popular teams during that time. The pair won the tag team titles on three occasions. One notable match was a Buried Alive match that pitted the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Sock Connection against The Undertaker and The Big Show, who were out for revenge after losing the tag titles one week earlier. This match included a spot where The Big Show tossed Mankind off the stage, landing hard on the dirt and falling into the grave- Mankind traveled nearly 25 feet in total. Foley then helped ''Raw'' achieve its highest [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] ever with a segment featuring himself (as Mankind) and The Rock. The \"This Is Your Life\" segment aired on September 27, 1999, and received an 8.4 rating, with Yurple the Clown making another appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/990927.html |title=Slashwrestling Raw report \u2013 with ratings |accessdate=January 13, 2007 |author=Christopher Robin Zimmerman |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102112807/http://slashwrestling.com/raw/990927.html |archivedate=November 2, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn August 1999, Foley returned after a three-month absence recovering from knee surgery to resume his feud with [[Triple H]], who had kayfabe injured Foley's left knee with his sledgehammer. On an episode of ''Raw'', Mankind drew with Triple H in a match for the number one contender for the WWF Championship, which resulted in a Triple Threat match between Steve Austin, Triple H and Mankind at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] for the title. Foley won the WWF Championship for the third time at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], pinning the reigning champion Austin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/aug23_fol.html|last=Powell|first=John|title=Mick Foley New Champion at SummerSlam!|publisher=SLAM!

The next night on ''Raw'', Triple H defeated Mankind to win his first WWF championship. A feud then developed between Mankind and the McMahon-Helmsley regime, led by Triple H. This included Triple H defeating Mankind in another Boiler Room Brawl on the September 23 edition of ''Smackdown!'', as part of a five-match \u201cgauntlet\u201c challenge set upon Triple H by Vince McMahon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWXn5CtCYOk&t=1s|title=Triple H vs Mankind (Boiler Room Brawl) - Sept 23, 1999|accessdate=June 30, 2019 |author=WWE}}</ref>\n\nMankind continued his feud with Triple H when he was supposed to have the last Boiler Room Brawl match with \"[[Santa Claus]]\".

Foley then reverted to his Cactus Jack persona in January 2000 and faced Triple H for the WWF Championship at [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]] in a [[Hardcore wrestling|Street Fight]]. Cactus used a 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire, and thumbtacks- trademark weapons from his pre-WWF days, but Triple H won the match after delivering two pedigrees, the second slamming Cactus face-first onto a pile of tacks. This feud culminated with a rematch at [[No Way Out (2000)|No Way Out]] in a Hell in a Cell match, where stipulations held that Cactus Jack could not use foreign metallic objects he used in the Royal Rumble, and if he did not win the title, Foley had to retire from wrestling. During the match, they had made their way onto the top of the cell and Foley was preparing to Piledrive Triple H onto a barbed wire 2x4 on fire, but Triple H reversed it into a backdrop, causing the cage to give way, Foley fell through the canvas.

Foley has said that he intended for his Commissioner Foley character to be a \"role model for nerds,\" cracking lame jokes and making no attempt to appear tough or scary. He also had a knack during this time to have no one spot for his office; rather, Mick would have an office in all sorts of odd places (for example, closets). Foley turned getting [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#pop|cheap pops]] into something of a catchphrase, as he shamelessly declared at each WWF show that he was thrilled to be \"right here in (whatever city in which he was performing (e.g., New York))!\" punctuated with an intentionally cheesy thumbs-up gesture. During this time, Commissioner Foley engaged in rivalries with [[Kurt Angle]], [[Edge and Christian]], and Vince McMahon without actually wrestling them. He left the position in December 2000 after being \"fired\" onscreen by McMahon during which he received a brutal beat down.\n\nFoley made a surprise return on the ''Raw'' just before [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] and announced that he would be the [[referee (professional wrestling)#Special referee|special guest referee]] in the match between Mr. McMahon and his son Shane at WrestleMania. After WrestleMania, Foley made sporadic appearances on WWF programming throughout the middle of the year, at one point introducing Minnesota Governor [[Jesse Ventura]] during a taping of ''Raw'' in the state as a foil to Mr. McMahon, as well as serving as the guest referee for the Earl Hebner versus Nick Patrick Referee match and a tag-team bra and panties match between WWF wrestlers [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] & [[Trish Stratus]] vs WCW stars [[Stacy Keibler]] & [[Torrie Wilson]] at the [[WWF Invasion]] pay-per-view. Foley returned as commissioner in October 2001, near the end of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] angle. During this brief tenure, Foley had the opportunity to [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] on the WWF's direction and how dissatisfied he was with it. Saying that there were far too many championships in the company, he booked unification matches before the final pay-per-view of the storyline, [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]]. After Survivor Series, he ended his commissionership at Vince McMahon's request and left the company.\n\n=== Independent circuit (2003\u20132005) ===\nDuring his absences from WWE, Foley made frequent appearances on the [[independent circuit]] from 2003 to 2005, primarily in non-wrestling roles, either as a referee, manager, or special guest.\n\nHis first independent circuit appearance was on December 12, 2003 for International Wrestling Cartel, where he was the special guest referee for a match between [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and [[Jerry Lawler]].\n\nFoley did not appear on the independent circuit again until May 2004, when he appeared for the Japanese promotion [[HUSTLE]] and returned to the ring to face [[Toshiaki Kawada]] for the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]], but ended up losing.\n\nOn September 11, 2004, Foley made his debut for [[Ring of Honor]] and cut a promo, praising ROH and referring to it as \"Ring of Hardcore\", thus establishing himself as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]. On October 3, Foley refereed a match between Jerry Lawler and [[Slyck Wagner Brown]] for the New England Wrestling promotion. On October 15, Foley returned to ROH where he confronted [[Ricky Steamboat]], who claimed that traditional wrestling was better than hardcore wrestling. The next day, both Foley and Steamboat cut promos on each other, leading to a match between two teams of wrestlers handpicked by both men, with [[Nigel McGuiness]] and [[Chad Collyer]] representing Steamboat and [[Dan Maff]] and [[B.J. Whitmer]] representing Foley, which was won by McGuiness and Collyer. On November 6, Foley teased a heel turn when he called [[ROH World Championship|ROH Champion]] [[Samoa Joe]] \"softcore\". On November 20, Foley made a surprise appearance for New York Wrestling Connection, making a run-in during [[Mikey Whipwreck]] and Ken Scampi's match against Mayhem and Tony Burma, where he helped Whipwreck and Scampi win.\n\nFoley made an appearance on the [[A Night of Appreciation for Sabu|Night of Appreciation for Sabu]], where he refereed the match between [[Shane Douglas]] and Raven, where Sabu himself interfered in the match and helped Douglas win.\n\nFoley returned to ROH on December 26 at ROH's Final Battle event and had his final confrontation with Ricky Steamboat, where the two made peace. On January 15, 2005, Foley turned heel after he was confronted by Samoa Joe and hit Joe over the head with a steel chair. One week later, Foley appeared with [[Border City Wrestling]] to referee the match between [[Alex Shelley]] and [[Chris Sabin]] for the BCW Television Championship, which Sabin won.\n\nFoley refereed the main event of the first [[WrestleReunion]] show, which saw Dusty Rhodes, [[Goldust|Dustin Rhodes]], and [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]] battle [[Abdullah the Butcher]], [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], and [[CM Punk]].\n\nOn February 19, Foley resumed his feud with Samoa Joe in ROH, teasing a return to the ring but instead choosing [[Vordell Walker]] to fight Joe. After Joe defeated Walker, Foley introduced his \"backup plan\" New Cactus Jack to fight Joe in a second match, which Joe won as well.\n\nOn February 26, Foley appeared with Frank Goodman's USA Xtreme promotion, cutting a promo saying that there was no need to wait until June for an ECW reunion (referring to the upcoming [[Hardcore Homecoming]] show being put together by Shane Douglas), and brought out [[Axl Rotten]], Shane Douglas, [[Chris Candido]], [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Tammy Sytch]], [[Balls Mahoney]], [[Al Snow]], [[Justin Credible]], [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], Terry Funk and Sabu, much to the excitement of the crowd, who began an \"E-C-Dub!\" chant. But then Raven came out and cut a promo saying that he had only ever been the one true star of ECW and everyone else had just been a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]], leading to a match between Raven and Balls Mahoney later in the night, which Raven won by DQ when he threw fire in Mahoney's eyes. After this, Foley and several of the other ECW alumni came to the ring and attacked Raven.\n\nOn April 2, Foley appeared with [[Harley Race]]'s [[World League Wrestling]] to referee a match between [[William Mueller|Trevor Rhodes]] and Brandon Bishop, which was ruled a No-Contest. After the match, Rhodes, Bishop, and Johnny Gold all attacked Foley until Terry Funk and Harley Race ran in and fought the three wrestlers off. Afterwards, Foley left the arena with Funk and Race.\n\nOn April 30, Foley refereed a match at a Northeast Wrestling show between Jerry Lawler and [[King Kong Bundy]], which Lawler won.\n\nOn May 7, Foley made a return to the ring at the Mark Curtis Memorial Show, where he was victorious in a tag team match with Shane Douglas against Al Snow and [[D'Lo Brown]], which also featured [[Dominic DeNucci]] (Foley and Douglas' trainer) in his and Douglas' corner.\n\nThe main event of the ECW reunion show Hardcore Homecoming was Terry Funk against Sabu and Shane Douglas in a Triple Threat Elimination No Ropes Barbed Wire Match. During the middle of the match, [[Bill Alfonso]], who was in Sabu's corner, began pulling Shane Douglas into the wire, which led to [[Francine Fournier|Francine]], who was in Douglas' corner, attacking Alfonso. Using this as a distraction, Douglas brought a ladder into the ring when suddenly the lights in the arena went out. When they came back on, Foley was in the ring, as Cactus Jack, wearing a referee shirt. Foley pulled out a barbed-wire wrapped Mr. Socko and applied the Mandible Claw on Douglas, then DDT'd Douglas onto a steel chair. Terry Funk then crawled onto Douglas and eliminated him when Foley made the 3-count. After that, Funk targeted Sabu, throwing him into the barbed wire, then setting up a table and putting Sabu on it. Funk then climbed up the ladder, but before he got far, it collapsed from under his weight, sending him crashing through the table. Sabu then recovered, gave Funk an Arabian Facebuster off a chair, and pinned Funk to win the match. After the match ended, all four of them were greeted with chants of \"Terry!\" and \"Sabu!\" and \"Foley!\" and \"Thank You Shane!\" and of course \"E-C-Dub! E-C-Dub!\". The entire locker room emptied moments later and celebrated with Funk, Sabu, Foley, and Douglas in the ring to continued \"E-C-Dub\" chants.\n\nOn July 8, Foley returned to ROH as a face, confronting ROH Champion CM Punk, who had turned heel and mocked ROH and the championship after he had signed with WWE and threatened to take the title with him to WWE. Foley acted as a direct line to Vince McMahon, attempting to convince Punk to defend his title one last time on McMahon's orders before he departed from ROH.\n\nOn August 13, Foley made an appearance with Ballpark Brawl to make fun of [[Matthew Kaye|Matt Striker]], who had been doing an impersonation of The Rock. Later in the event, Foley refereed the Canes, Tables, and Chairs match between Sandman and Sabu, which Sandman won. After the match, Foley celebrated with Sandman by drinking beer with him in the middle of the ring.\n\nOn August 20, Foley returned to ROH again, as a face, to rescue [[Jade Chung]] from [[Prince Nana]]. Foley was then attacked from behind by Alex Shelley and [[The Embassy (professional wrestling)|The Embassy]] until [[Austin Aries]] and [[Roderick Strong]] chased them off. One week later, Foley returned to the ring for the second WrestleReunion show to team with Terry Funk and [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] in a losing effort against the [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|Midnight Express]] ([[Stan Lane]], [[Bobby Eaton]], and [[Dennis Condrey]].)\n\nFoley made his final regular appearance with ROH on September 17, when he was in [[A.J. Styles]]' corner in a match against Embassy member [[Jimmy Rave]], which Styles won. Afterwards, Foley put over ROH huge saying he enjoyed being on ROH shows and would speak highly of it.\n\nFoley made his final major independent circuit appearance on the Tribute to ''Starrcade'' show on November 19 as the referee for the match between Dustin Rhodes and Terry Funk, which ended in a No-Contest.\n\n=== Return to WWE ===\n====Various feuds (2003&ndash;2006)====\nFoley returned in June 2003 to referee the [[Hell in a Cell]] match between Triple H and [[Kevin Nash]] at Bad Blood. On June 23, during a ''Raw'' broadcast in [[Madison Square Garden]], he was honored for his achievements in the ring and presented with the retired [[WWE Hardcore Championship]] belt. The evening ended with Foley taking a beating and kicked down a flight of stairs by [[Randy Orton]] and [[Ric Flair]]. In December 2003, Foley returned to replace Steve Austin as co-general manager of ''Raw''. He soon grew tired of the day-to-day travel and left his full-time duties to write and spend time with his family. In the storyline, Foley was afraid to wrestle a match with Intercontinental Champion [[Randy Orton]] on the December 15 episode of ''Raw'' and walked out of the match rather than face him, the result of the match was ruled a draw. After Foley walked backstage, Orton confronted him asking why he walked out of the match, calling him a coward in the process, before spitting in his face. Foley walked out of the arena afterwards.\n\nIn 2004, Foley returned briefly to wrestling, competing in the [[Royal Rumble]] and eliminating both Orton and himself with his trademark Cactus Jack clothesline. He and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] reunited as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection and lost a handicap match to [[Evolution (professional wrestling)|Evolution]] at [[WrestleMania XX]]. Foley and Orton continued to feud, culminating in a [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore match]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] at [[Backlash (2004)|Backlash]], where a thumbtack-covered Orton defeated Foley, as his Cactus Jack persona, to retain the title after hitting Foley with his signature move, the ''RKO'' onto a barbed wire covered baseball bat. Foley regards this match as possibly the best of his career.<ref>Foley, Mick. The Hardcore Diaries (p.260)</ref>\n\nFoley appeared as a color commentator at WWE's [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]], which aired on June 12, 2005, and subsequently renewed his contract with WWE. Foley returned in 2005 in a match where fans were able to vote on which persona he would appear as\u2014Mankind, Dude Love, or Cactus Jack\u2014against [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]] at [[Taboo Tuesday (2005)|Taboo Tuesday]]. The fans voted for Mankind, who went on to win the match- this was the last time Foley ever wrestled as Mankind. On the February 16, 2006, ''Raw'', Foley returned to referee the WWE Championship match between [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[John Cena]]. After Cena won, Edge attacked Foley, and the following week, Foley challenged Edge to a match at [[WrestleMania 22]]. In the intensely brutal match, the heavily bloodied and thumbtack-covered Edge defeated Foley after spearing him through a flaming table, where both performers suffered second-degree burns after anti-flame material was not applied to the flaming table, at their own request.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt54lUPqWEk|title=Bruce Prichard shoots on Edge vs Mick Foley at Wrestlemania|accessdate=July 31, 2019|date=December 27, 2018}}</ref> In the weeks after the match, an \"impressed\" Foley turned heel and allied himself with Edge against the newly rejuvenated [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]]. At [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|ECW One Night Stand]], Foley, Edge and [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] defeated Terry Funk, [[Tommy Dreamer]] and [[Beulah McGillicutty]] in a violent and brutal tag-team hardcore match, which included a spot where Funk hit Foley with a barbed wire 2x4 plank lit on fire, and the flame latched onto Foley, and he then fell onto a plywood board covered in more barbed wire.\n\nFoley then engaged in a storyline rivalry with [[Ric Flair]], inspired by real-life animosity between the two. In ''Have a Nice Day!'', Foley wrote that Flair was \"every bit as bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it.\" In response, Flair wrote in his autobiography that Foley was \"a glorified stuntman\" and that he was able to climb the ladder in the WWF only because he was friends with the bookers. The two had a backstage confrontation at a ''Raw'' event in December 2004 in [[Huntsville]], [[Alabama]], but Foley has said that they have largely reconciled.<ref name=SlamFoleyRicFlair>{{cite web|last=Baines|first=Tim|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/06/27/516827.html|title= Ric Flair Critical of Mick Foley in New Book|publisher=SLAM!

The result was a Two-out-of-Three Falls match at [[Vengeance (2006)|Vengeance]], where Flair beat Foley in two straight falls. The two then wrestled in an intensely brutal and bloody [[\"I Quit\" match|\"I Quit\" hardcore match]] at [[SummerSlam (2006)|SummerSlam]] in which Flair, who was covered in blood, thumbtacks and cuts from barbed wire won the match when he forced Foley to quit by threatening [[Melina Perez|Melina]] with a barbed-wire bat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060827/ai_n16698659|title=Flair and Foley put on great show|publisher=Chicago Sun Times|accessdate=June 11, 2007|date=August 27, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071209071650/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20060827/ai_n16698659 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 9, 2007}}</ref> On the August 21 episode of ''Raw'', Foley kissed [[Vince McMahon]]'s buttocks as part of McMahon's \"[[Vince McMahon#The Invasion and brand extension (2001\u20132005)|Kiss My Ass Club]]\" [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] after he threatened to fire Melina. Shortly thereafter, she betrayed Foley and announced that he was fired.\n\n====Sporadic appearances and SmackDown color commentator (2007&ndash;2008)====\nSeven months later, Foley made his return to ''Raw'' as a face on March 5, 2007, with the storyline being that he tricked McMahon into giving him his job back. At [[Vengeance: Night of Champions|Vengeance]], Foley wrestled in a WWE Championship Challenge match involving WWE Champion [[John Cena]], [[Randy Orton]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|King Booker]], and [[Bobby Lashley]]. Cena retained by pinning Foley. A month later, Foley made an appearance on ''Raw'' as the special guest referee for a match between [[Jonathan Coachman]] and Mr. McMahon's storyline illegitimate son [[Hornswoggle]]. Foley then made an appearance on ''SmackDown'' the same week, where he defeated Coachman with Hornswoggle as the special guest referee. On the January 7, 2008 episode of ''Raw'', Foley and his tag team partner Hornswoggle qualified for the [[Royal Rumble (2008)|Royal Rumble]] by defeating [[The Highlanders (professional wrestling)|The Highlanders]], but Foley was eliminated by Triple H during the Royal Rumble match.\n\nFoley debuted as a color commentator for SmackDown alongside [[Michael Cole (wrestling)|Michael Cole]] at [[Backlash (2008)|Backlash]] in 2008, replacing [[Jonathan Coachman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/exclusives/foleybacklash|title=Foley joins Smackdown! broadcast team|accessdate=April 27, 2008|date=April 27, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080430135314/http://www.wwe.com/shows/backlash/exclusives/foleybacklash <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = April 30, 2008}}</ref> On the edition of August 1 of ''SmackDown'', Foley was [[kayfabe]] attacked by Edge during Edge's promo for his [[SummerSlam (2008)|SummerSlam]] match against [[The Undertaker]]. Foley sat out the August 8 ''SmackDown'' to sell his recovery from the injuries. Tazz filled in for Foley as a color commentator on ''SmackDown'', while Raw wrestler [[Matt Striker]] filled in for Tazz on ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]''. Foley told Long Island Press pro wrestling columnist Josh Stewart in August 2008 that \"creatively, the announcing job wasn't working out too well\". He expanded with Dave Meltzer on the Observer radio show that the environment was creatively frustrating. Foley allowed his contract with WWE to expire on September 1, 2008, and quietly left the company.\n\n=== Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ===\n==== Championship reigns (2008\u20132009) ====\n[[File:TNA Bound to Glory IV (93 of 136).jpg|thumb|right|Foley at [[Bound for Glory IV]]]]\nOn September 3, 2008, Foley's agency, Gillespie Talent, issued a press release that stated Foley had signed a short-term deal with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA).

Two weeks later, Foley made his full television debut in a promo making comments about the [[List of WWE personnel|WWE roster]], Vince McMahon and [[Kurt Angle]]. At [[Bound for Glory IV]], he was the special guest enforcer for Jarrett and Angle's match. Later, on ''Impact!'', Foley said goodbye, but was then approached by Jeff Jarrett with a new offer; he later indicated that they had come to terms on a new contract and would make a major announcement the next week. On the October 23 episode of ''Impact!'', Foley announced that he was now co-owner of TNA along with Jarrett, just after Kurt Angle headbutted him.\n\nOn November 27, Thanksgiving Day, TNA presented the Turkey Bowl. [[Alex Shelley]] ended up being pinned by [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]], and Foley handed Rhino the check. Afterwards, the defeated Shelley had to put on a Turkey Suit in compliance with the match rules, albeit with much refusal. However, Shelley \"[[Finger (gesture)|flipped off]]\" Foley and proceeded to beat him up. In the aftermath, Mick mentioned that Shelley is lucky he still has his job. [[The Main Event Mafia]]'s [[Kevin Nash]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and [[Scott Steiner]] were going to take on [[D-Von Dudley|Brother Devon]], [[A.J. Styles]], and Mick Foley in his debut matchup at [[Genesis (2009)|Genesis]]. Nash, however, suffered a legitimate staph infection and missed Genesis. He was replaced by [[Monty Sopp|Cute Kip]]. Foley got the pin when he hit Scott Steiner with a double arm DDT onto a chair.\n\nOn April 19, 2009 at [[Lockdown (2009)|Lockdown]], he defeated [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] to win the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]] for his first-ever championship in TNA, and his fourth World title overall. Mick did not lose the championship, but Sting became the new leader of the Main Event Mafia by pinning Kurt Angle at [[Sacrifice (2009)|Sacrifice]]. Foley had also stated on ''[[TNA Impact!|Impact!]]'' tapings that if he retained the TNA World Heavyweight Title at the [[King of the Mountain match]] at [[Slammiversary (2009)|Slammiversary]], he would only put the title up in a match once a year. However, he lost the title to Kurt Angle in the King of The Mountain match at Slammiversary. He received a rematch at [[Victory Road (2009)|Victory Road]], commenting he had only submitted once in his career (to Terry Funk, in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Spinning toe hold|spinning toe hold]]) and swore he'd never do it again. He lost the match when Angle forced him to submit again with the [[ankle lock]].\n\nOn July 30, 2009, the 200th episode of ''Impact!'', Foley won the [[TNA Global Championship|TNA Legends Championship]] by pinning champion Kevin Nash in a tag team match where Nash teamed with Angle and Foley with [[Bobby Lashley]]. At [[Hard Justice (2009)|Hard Justice]], Nash defeated Foley to regain the title, following interference from [[Tracy Brookshaw|Traci Brooks]].\n\n==== Various storylines (2009\u20132011) ====\nOn the edition of September 24 of ''Impact!'' Foley turned [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]]  when he attacked [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]] during and after a [[TNA World Tag Team Championship]] match against Booker T and Scott Steiner.

In 2015, Foley appeared at [[SummerSlam (2015)|SummerSlam]], where he kicked off the event with host [[Jon Stewart]]. Foley returned to ''Raw'' on March 14, 2016 in a backstage segment with Dean Ambrose, in which he gave him a pep talk for his upcoming [[WrestleMania 32]] match against [[Brock Lesnar]] and a passing of the torch in the form of his iconic barbed wire baseball bat, \"Barbie\". On April 3, 2016 at [[WrestleMania 32]], Foley returned in-ring alongside [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] in a post-match interruption where the trio of Hall of Famers took on [[The League of Nations (professional wrestling)|The League of Nations]] after they had defeated [[The New Day (wrestling)|The New Day]] and proclaimed \"No three people can ever defeat us.\" Foley brought out Mr. Socko and executed the Mandible Claw two times during the fight, once on [[Sheamus]] and once on [[Wade Barrett|King Barrett]].

Foley has since unveiled new titles exclusive to the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw brand]], while also making fair decisions to favor the faces and occasionally disagreeing with Stephanie McMahon. One of Foley's first decisions as Raw General Manager was pitting the feuding [[Sheamus]] and [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] against one another in a Best of 7 series. Going into [[WWE Clash of Champions|Clash of Champions]] the duo were tied 3-3. At Clash of Champions, both men would be counted out resulting in a draw and the best of seven series being declared a draw. On the next night's episode of ''Raw'' Foley who had promised the victor a championship opportunity would put the two in a tag team. They would later lose to The New Day in a WWE Tag Team Championship match before going on to capture the RAW Tag Team Championships against the New Day at the Roadblock: End of the Line pay-per-view. On the November 21 episode of ''Raw'', Foley would place [[Sami Zayn]] in a match against [[Braun Strowman]] after Zayn failed to defeat [[The Miz]] at [[Survivor Series (2016)|Survivor Series]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] to bring the title to ''Raw''. During the match, Foley would order the match to be stopped, deeming Zayn unable to continue. The following week on ''Raw'', Zayn would demand a rematch against Strowman, but Foley would decline, telling Zayn he could not beat him, making Zayn storm off in anger. On the December 12 episode of ''Raw'', Zayn would once again ask for a rematch with Strowman but was once again rejected by Foley. Zayn would then tell Foley he was pondering going to ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' because Foley did not believe in him. Later that night, after Zayn defeated [[Jinder Mahal]], Foley would tell him he has arranged a trade with ''SmackDown'' for him in exchange for [[Eva Marie]]. Zayn would angrily refuse the trade and once again demanded a rematch with Strowman. Foley would yield, giving Zayn his match with Strowman at [[Roadblock: End of the Line]] with a ten-minute time limit.\n\nOn the March 13, 2017 episode of ''Raw'', Stephanie McMahon forced Foley to fire a member of the ''Raw'' roster by the end of the night. Foley chose to fire Stephanie McMahon herself, which prompted [[Triple H]] to come out and confront Foley. After being insulted and ordered to leave the ring, Foley instead attacked Triple H, stuffing a sock in Triple H's mouth via ''Mr. Socko'' before being low blowed by McMahon. [[Seth Rollins]] would then come out to aid Foley, only to be attacked by Triple H. On the March 20 episode of ''Raw'', Stephanie McMahon would fire Foley for his actions the previous week. A few weeks later Foley made an appearance at the WWE Hall of Fame [[WWE Hall of Fame (2017)|class of 2017]] ceremony.\n\n====Return to Raw (2018\u2013present)====\nOn the September 10, 2018 episode of ''Raw''.

He was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] class of [[WWE Hall of Fame (2013)|2013]].\n\nFoley has wrestled under his real name and various personas. His main persona during his time in WCW and ECW from 1991 to 1996 was '''Cactus Jack''', a bloodthirsty and uncompromisingly physical brawler from [[Truth or Consequences, New Mexico]] who wore cowboy boots and often wrestled with sharp and/or solid metallic objects, such as barbed wire, thumbtacks, or metal trashcans. When Foley got to the WWF in 1996, he debuted the persona known as '''Mankind''', a masked, mentally deranged loner who stuffed a smelly gym sock in his opponents' mouths and spent his spare time dwelling in boiler rooms; and later Foley debuted '''Dude Love''', a relaxed, fun-loving, jive-talking, tie-dyed shirt-wearing hippie. These personas were known as the \"Three Faces of Foley\", and Cactus Jack made his debut in the WWF in 1997. He is a four-time [[Professional wrestling championship#World championships|world champion]] (three [[WWE Championship|WWF Championships]] and one [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]]), an 11-time [[World tag team championship|world tag team champion]] (eight [[World Tag Team Championship (WWE)|WWF Tag Team Championships]], two [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]]s and one [[WCW World Tag Team Championship]]), a one-time [[TNA King of the Mountain Championship|TNA Legends Champion]], and the inaugural [[WWE Hardcore Championship|WWF Hardcore Champion]]. Foley's dedicated and physical style of wrestling led him to often participate in violent and brutal matches that involved him taking dangerous bumps and putting his body through a considerable physical toll, and would sometimes cause him or his opponents to bleed copiously, earning him the moniker \"The Hardcore Legend\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/mick-foleys-12-wildest-matches|title=Dirty dozen: Mick Foley's 12 wildest ngmatches|website=WWE.com}}</ref>\n\n== Early life ==\nMichael Francis Foley<ref name=\"IGN\">{{cite web|url=http://stars.ign.com/objects/142/14208780_biography.html|title=Mick Foley Biography|accessdate=May 20, 2008 |publisher=[[IGN]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904210033/http://stars.ign.com/objects/142/14208780_biography.html|archivedate=September 4, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/m/mick-foley.html|title=Mick Foley's profile|accessdate=April 14, 2008|publisher=Online World of Wrestling}}</ref> was born in [[Bloomington, Indiana]],<ref name=\"IGN\"/> on June 7, 1965.<ref name=\"OWOW\"/><ref name=\"IGN\"/> He is of Irish descent,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pscp.tv/JOEdotie/1zqJVRoaBMDJB?t=120|title=JOE.ie @JOEdotie|first=Twitter|last=Inc|website=Periscope}}</ref> and has an older brother named John. Shortly after his birth, he moved with his family to the [[Long Island]] town of [[Setauket-East Setauket, New York|East Setauket, New York]] about 40 miles east of [[New York City]], where he attended [[Ward Melville High School]]. At school, he [[Scholastic wrestling|wrestled]] and played [[lacrosse]],<ref name=\"IGN\"/><ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 11\u201312, 19</ref> and was a classmate and wrestling teammate of actor [[Kevin James]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hobotrashcan.com/interviews/mickfoley3.php|title=One on One with Mick Foley (2007)|first=Joel|last= Murphy|publisher=HoboTrashcan.com| accessdate=March 30, 2007|date=March 2007}}</ref> While a student at [[State University of New York at Cortland]], Foley hitchhiked to [[Madison Square Garden]] to see his favorite wrestler, [[Jimmy Snuka]], in a steel cage match against [[Don Muraco]].<ref name=WWEProfileMickFoley>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/wwealumni/mickfoley|title=Mick Foley |publisher=WWE Alumni profile, [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]|accessdate=October 1, 2010}}</ref><ref name=mf34/> He has said that Snuka's flying body splash from the top of the cage inspired him to pursue a career in pro wrestling.<ref name=WWEProfileMickFoley/><ref name=mf34>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 33\u201334</ref> He had a seat close to the front row and is visible on the video of the event.<ref name=mf34/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://s271.photobucket.com/user/jklmn_2008/media/FoleyMSG.jpg.html|title=Photo by Alec Settee|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n== Professional wrestling career ==\n=== Training and early career (1983\u20131991) ===\n[[File:Mick Foley.jpg|thumb|upright|Foley as Cactus Jack]]\nMick Foley formally trained at [[Dominic DeNucci]]'s wrestling school in [[Freedom, Pennsylvania]], driving several hours weekly from his college campus in [[Cortland, New York]], and debuted in 1983.<ref name=\"HAND\"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Foley|first1=Mick|title=Mick Foley - 30 YEARS AGO TODAY: MY FIRST MATCH EVER...|url=https://www.facebook.com/RealMickFoley/photos/a.150133228350157.28288.126269440736536/1326472897382845/?type=3&permPage=1|website=facebook.com|accessdate=July 6, 2016}}</ref> In addition to appearing on DeNucci's cards, Foley and several other students also took part in some [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#squash|squash]] matches as [[Job (professional wrestling)#jobbers|jobbers]] for [[WWE|WWF]] TV tapings of ''[[Prime Time Wrestling]]'' and ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars of Wrestling]]'', where Foley wrestled under the names Jack Foley and Nick Foley. In one of these matches (the very first episode of Superstars), Foley and [[Les Thornton]] (another jobber) faced the [[British Bulldogs]], during which the [[Dynamite Kid]] (who had a long earned reputation as a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#stiff|stiff]] worker in the ring) clotheslined Foley with such force that he was unable to eat solid food for several weeks.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 82\u201385</ref> During these squash matches, Foley also faced other top-level talent at the time, such as [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules Hernandez]]. His run would not last long, as he had not signed a contract with the promotion at the time. During this run, he was also billed from different hometowns and at different weights.\n\nAfter several years of wrestling in the [[independent circuit]], Foley began receiving offers from various regional promotions, including [[Bill Watts]]' [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Bill Watts)|Universal Wrestling Federation]] (UWF).<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 91\u201393</ref> He joined the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]-based [[Continental Wrestling Association]] (CWA) as Cactus Jack Manson, where he teamed with Gary Young as part of the [[Stud Stable]].<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 117</ref> Cactus and Young briefly held the CWA tag titles in late 1988.<ref name=SlamFoleyBio>{{cite web|last=Milner|first=John|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Bios/foley.html|title=Mick Foley Profile|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=March 20, 2006|date=November 18, 2004}}</ref> On November 20, Foley left CWA for Texas-based [[World Class Championship Wrestling]].\n\nIn [[World Class Championship Wrestling]] (WCCW), Cactus Jack, billed as Cactus Jack Manson, was a major part of [[Skandor Akbar]]'s stable. (The addition of \"Manson\" to Foley's name, due to its implied connection to [[Charles Manson]], made him uncomfortable.)<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 131, 146</ref> Foley also won several titles, including the company's light heavyweight and tag team titles before leaving the company, losing his last match to [[Eric Embry]] in nine seconds. He then briefly competed in Alabama's Continental Wrestling Federation before completing a brief stint with [[World Championship Wrestling]]. For much of his time there, he would team with jobbers.  When the jobber would lose the match for the team, Cactus Jack would attack his partner, throw them out of the ring, and deliver his infamous ring apron flying elbow drop onto the concrete floor. One notable occasion he did this was in [[Gainesville, Georgia]] against the rising tag team of brothers [[Rick Steiner|Rick]] and [[Scott Steiner]]- two of the stiffest workers in wrestling at the time. Cactus was partnered with a one-time jobber named Rick Fargo, and after taking brutal bumps from both Steiner brothers and losing the match, Cactus then began fighting with Fargo, and then jumped nearly 12 feet off the apron to elbow Fargo in the abdomen, per Kevin Sullivan\u2019s instructions. Lead WCW booker [[Ric Flair]], Sullivan and other WCW executives were impressed with this to the point that they offered Foley a contract, and Foley finally found some financial stability after years of hardship. His biggest match at the time was a few weeks later against [[Mil M\u00e1scaras]] at ''[[Clash of the Champions X: Texas Shootout]]'', where he took a particularly brutal bump backwards off the 3-foot high apron and landed on the concrete floor, with his head and back taking the impact.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 169</ref> It was during this period that Foley was involved in a car accident that resulted in the loss of his two front teeth, adding to the distinctive look for which he is famous.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 164\u2013166</ref> Following the short stint with WCW, Foley then signed with [[Herb Abrams]]'s [[Universal Wrestling Federation (Herb Abrams)|Universal Wrestling Federation]].<ref name=SlamFoleyBio/><ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 183</ref> In UWF, Foley teamed with [[Bob Orton, Jr.|Bob Orton]] to feud with [[Don Muraco]], [[Sunny Beach (wrestler)|Sunny Beach]], and [[Brian Blair]].\n\nHe soon left UWF for [[Professional wrestling promotion|Tri-State Wrestling]] (a forerunner to [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]]),<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 192</ref> whose high-impact and violent wrestling style fit Foley well. On one night, known as Tri-State's Summer Sizzler 1991, Cactus Jack and [[Eddie Gilbert (wrestler)|Eddie Gilbert]] had three matches in one night: Cactus won a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]], lost a [[Professional wrestling match types#Container-based variations|Stretcher match]], and then fought to a double [[Professional wrestling#Disqualification|disqualification]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#steel Cage match|Steel Cage match]].<ref name=mf194>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 194\u2013195</ref> These matches caught the attention of [[World Championship Wrestling]] promoters, in large part due to widespread photo circulation. In 1991, after a brief stint working in the [[Global Wrestling Federation]], Foley joined WCW full-time.<ref name=SlamFoleyBio/><ref name=mf194/>\n\n=== World Championship Wrestling===\n==== Early years (1991\u20131993) ====\nOn September 5, 1991, Cactus Jack debuted as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] and attacked [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]].<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 201</ref> After feuds with [[Van Hammer]] and [[Abdullah the Butcher]], Cactus Jack faced Sting, then WCW World Heavyweight Champion, in a non-title Falls Count Anywhere match at [[Beach Blast (1992)|Beach Blast]] in 1992, which Sting won.<ref name=mf223>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 223</ref> For a long time, Foley considered this the best match he ever worked.<ref name=mf223/> Unlike Jack's first stint in WCW, where his personality was quieter, he was now outwardly maniacal; laughing hysterically, shrieking into the air while choking his opponents and yelling his signature catchphrase \"Bang-Bang!\".\n\nAfter spending a year and a half with WCW as a heel, Cactus Jack transitioned into a fan favorite after engaging in a feud with Paul Orndorff, Harley Race and Big Van Vader. Jack and Orndorff wrestled each other in a match for a spot on WCW World Heavyweight Champion Vader's team at ''[[Clash of the Champions XXII]]''. After the match, Race and Orndorff beat up Jack. At the following Clash of Champions event, Cactus Jack helped Sting's team win the match. He engaged in a feud with Orndorff, winning a falls-count-anywhere match against Orndorff at [[SuperBrawl III]]. He then moved on to face Big Van Vader.\n\n==== Feud with Vader (1993\u20131994) ====\nCactus Jack wrestled [[Big Van Vader]] on April 6, 1993, winning by count-out, but being severely beaten in the process. As a result, in the rematch with Vader on April 24, the two executed a dangerous spot to sell a storyline injury. Harley Race removed the protective mats at ringside and Vader [[powerbomb]]ed Cactus onto the exposed concrete floor, causing a legitimate concussion and causing Foley to temporarily lose sensation in his left foot.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 243\u2013244</ref> While Foley was away, WCW ran an [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]] where Cactus Jack's absence was explained with a [[Farce|farcical]] comedy storyline in which he went crazy, was institutionalized, escaped, and developed amnesia.<ref name=mf248>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', pp. 248\u2013250</ref> Foley had wanted the injury storyline to be very serious and generate genuine sympathy for him before his return. The comedy [[glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignettes]] that WCW produced instead were so bad that Foley jokes in ''Have a Nice Day'' that they were the brainchild of WCW executives who regarded a surefire moneymaking feud as a problem that needed to be solved. The angle was awarded \"Most Disgusting Promotional Tactic\" by the esteemed [[Dave Meltzer|Wrestling Newsletter Observer]].<ref name=mf248/>\n\nIn one of WCW's most brutal matches of all time, Cactus faced Vader in a [[professional wrestling match types#Last Man Standing match|Texas Death match]] at [[Halloween Havoc (1993)|Halloween Havoc]].<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 256</ref> Race won the match for Vader by using a stun gun on Cactus, knocking him out. The level of violence involved in this feud caused WCW to refuse to book Cactus Jack against Vader on a pay-per-view again. On March 16, 1994, during a WCW European tour, Foley and Big Van Vader had one of the most infamous matches in wrestling history in [[Munich]], Germany. Foley began a hangman\u2014a planned move where a wrestler's head is tangled between the top two ring ropes. Neither wrestler was aware that the ring ropes had been drawn extra tight before the event, and Foley was barely able to move. When Foley finally freed himself from the ropes and fell out of the ring, his ears were badly split at the back. When Foley re-entered the ring the two wrestlers began trading blows. During this time, Vader reached up and grabbed Foley's right ear, and ripped it off. The two men continued wrestling as the referee picked up the ear and gave it to the ring announcer. Vader claimed for years after that the ear had come off during the botched Hangman maneuver, however in a WWE Network video, Vader admits that after seeing footage that he had indeed removed Foley's ear. Cactus Jack and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] were scheduled to win the tag team titles at [[Slamboree (1994)|Slamboree]] in 1994.<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', p. 272</ref> Foley had to choose between reattaching his ear or wrestling in the pay-per-view and winning the titles. Foley chose to wrestle and won his only championship in WCW. Later on, Foley was frustrated by WCW and the company\u2019s new head [[Eric Bischoff]]\u2019s reluctance to work a storyline with Vader around losing his ear.\n\nWCW also shared a brief co-promotion with ECW during this time in which Foley represented WCW on ECW television as the WCW Tag Team champion, facing [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]] at [[Hostile City Showdown]] on June 24, 1994. During a promo, Foley spat on his Tag Team title belt and threw it to the ground to appeal to the hardcore fans who frowned upon the mainstream promotions.\n\n=== NWA Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994\u20131996) ===\nCactus Jack's first appearance for the NWA-affiliated [[Eastern Championship Wrestling]] came on the May 31, 1994 episode, with Cactus revealed as Sabu's opponent for June 24 at the ECW Arena in Philadelphia. After being part of a talent exchange between ECW & WCW, Foley brought his WCW tag team title belt and spit on it for a recorded ECW tv segment. Foley continued with ECW and began a feud with [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]]. Foley then began working the ECW tag team division on teams with [[Terry Funk]], [[Mikey Whipwreck]], and [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]]. He had two [[ECW World Tag Team Championship]] reigns with Whipwreck while in ECW.<ref name=ECWtag>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/us/ecw/ecw-t.html|title=ECW World Tag Team Title history with his son alex foley|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com}}</ref>\n\nAfter the stints in Smokey Mountain Wrestling and Japan noted below, Foley then returned to ECW to have a series of violent encounters with the Sandman, while challenging him and claiming that he had never been beaten in a falls count anywhere match. He then started to team with [[Tommy Dreamer]]. According to Heyman, Hardcore style differentiated Foley from other traditional wrestlers, so in ECW, Foley was right at home. After seeing a sign in the audience one night that said \"Cane Dewey\" a reference to Foley's real-life son, Foley began a [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] where he criticized hardcore wrestling and sought to renounce his status as a hardcore wrestling icon and used a very technical, slow wrestling as a way to punish the audience.<ref name=\"MondayNightWars\" >{{cite DVD|title=Monday Night War S01 E05:Have a Nice Day!|publisher=WWE|}}</ref> He said that he was on a mission to save his partner from making the mistake of trying to please bloodthirsty fans. The mismatched partnership lasted until August 5, 1995, when Cactus turned on Dreamer when they were teaming with [[The Pitbulls]] against Raven, [[Stevie Richards]] and [[The Dudley Brothers]] ([[Dudley Dudley (wrestler)|Dudley Dudley]] and [[Big Dick Dudley]]).  Cactus Jack DDT'ed his partner and joined Raven's Nest, as he wished to serve [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]]'s \"higher purpose\". He remained one of Raven's top henchmen for the remainder of his time in ECW. On August 28, Cactus beat the previously undefeated [[911 (wrestler)|911]]. As part of Foley's heel [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]], he began praising WWF and WCW on ECW television, which angered ECW fans. Their anger intensified once word began to spread that Foley was leaving to join the WWF (In ''Have a Nice Day'', Foley recounted an incident where he asked an ECW roadie to sell T-shirts for him at an event held in a Queens, New York venue where he had been popular even as a heel; the man came back after being spat upon numerous times by angry fans, who made him fear for his life<ref>Foley, ''Have A Nice Day!'', '''p.??'''</ref>). Even when he tried to give sincere good-byes to the fans, Cactus Jack was met with chants of \"You sold out\" by the ECW fanbase everywhere he went. Cactus was booked to face WWF hater [[Shane Douglas]], who won after he handcuffed Cactus and then hit him with no less than '''''ten''''' consecutive plastic chair shots and when he put Jack into a [[Professional wrestling holds#Figure four leglock|figure four leglock]], this allowed Mikey Whipwreck to get into the arena and land one last very hard chair shot to Cactus's face, knocking him unconscious. Foley's last ECW match was against Whipwreck on March 9, 1996, and he recounts that he was not looking forward to it due to the increasingly hostile reactions he got even when he wasn't in character. The ECW fans, who knew that this was Foley's last match, finally returned his affection. They cheered him throughout the match and chanted, \"Please don't go!\". After the match, Foley told the audience that their reaction made everything worthwhile and made his exit by dancing with [[Stevie Richards]] and [[The Blue Meanie]] to [[Frank Sinatra]]'s song \"[[Theme from New York, New York|New York, New York]]\". Foley has said that this exit was his favorite moment in wrestling.<ref name=SlamFoleyBio/><ref>Mick Foley, ''Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses: A Life in Wrestling''</ref>\n\n=== Smoky Mountain Wrestling and Japan (1994\u20131996)===\nAt the tail end of 1994, Foley joined [[Smoky Mountain Wrestling]] (SMW) as Cactus Jack, causing [[Balls Mahoney|Boo Bradley]] to lose the [[SMW Beat the Champ Television Championship]]. He often teamed with [[Brian Lee (wrestler)|Brian Lee]] to feud with Bradley and [[Chris Candido]]. Cactus Jack then began a crusade to rid Bradley of his valet [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Tamara Fytch]]. He ignited a feud between Candido and Bradley when he accused Candido of having sexual relations with Fytch. (Ironically, Candido and Fytch were a couple in real life). Cactus Jack left SMW before the feud was resolved.\n\nIn 1995, Foley went to Japan and wrestled in [[International Wrestling Association of Japan]] (IWA Japan), where he engaged in feuds with Terry Funk and Shoji Nakamaki. During his brief stint in Japan Foley had the nickname \"Tsunami Stopper.\" Foley, however, soon returned to ECW to feud with [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]]. Funk returned to team up with Sandman, and during a particularly violent spot, the pair hit Cactus with a [[Shinai|kendo stick]] forty-six times in a barbed wire rope match. Cactus Jack then defeated Funk at Hostile City Showdown 1995. Later, he fought Sandman for the ECW championship. During the match, Cactus Jack knocked Sandman unconscious and was declared the winner. Referee [[Bill Alfonso]], however, reversed his decision because the title cannot change hands by knockout.\n\nReturning to the IWA, Cactus Jack began a feud with [[Michael Kirchner|Leatherface]], whom he had betrayed during a tag team match. Foley also continued to wrestle in independent circuits, winning championships on the Ozark Mountain and [[Steel City Wrestling|Steel City]] circuits. On August 20, 1995, IWA organized a [[IWA Kawasaki Dream#1995 King of the Death Match Tournament|King of the Death Match]] tournament at their [[IWA Kawasaki Dream|Kawasaki Dream]] event, which featured some of the bloodiest, most violent and most brutal matches of Foley's career. Each level of the tournament featured a new and deadly [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]]: Cactus Jack's first-round during the day was a barbed-wire baseball bat, thumbtack deathmatch, in which he defeated Terry Gordy; the second round was a barbed-wire board, bed of nails match where Cactus Jack defeated Shoji Nakamaki. The final, at night against Terry Funk, was a barbed-wire rope, barbed-wire and [[C-4 (explosive)|C4]] board, time-bomb deathmatch, which Cactus Jack won with help from [[Tiger Jeet Singh]]. After the match, both men were covered in blood, ravaged by flesh cuts from the wire and burned by the C4 explosions. Foley later said that he only received $300 for the entire night,<ref>''Mick Foley's Greatest Hits and Misses: A Life in Wrestling'' DVD</ref> but in 2010 he wrote that, \"looking back that match in Honjo is probably the performance I'm proudest of.\"<ref name=\"Slate\" /> After the tournament, Foley's right arm had second-degree burns from the C-4 explosions from the match with Funk and his arm smelt of explosive chemicals. After a 14-hour flight from [[Tokyo]]'s [[Narita Airport]] to [[JFK Airport]] his father picked him up from the airport to take him back to his Long Island home, and immediately smelt something unusual. When Foley got home, his father and wife kept asking him about the awful smell, but he would not say anything, not wanting them to worry. After his father left, his wife persisted, so he revealed the burns to her. Later on, he teamed with [[Tracy Smothers]] for a quick run with the IWA tag team titles.\n\n=== World Wrestling Federation/WWF===\n==== Three faces of Foley (1996\u20131998) ====\nIn 1996, at the persistence of [[Jim Ross]], whom Foley had known in his days in WCW, WWF head [[Vince McMahon]] brought on Foley, and he signed a contract with WWF and this time, the WWF did not use Foley as \"[[Job (professional wrestling)|enhancement talent]]\". McMahon was not a fan of Cactus Jack and wanted to cover up Foley's face, so he was shown several designs for a new heel character- a man with a leather mask and chains, called '''Mason the Mutilator'''. However, WWF decided that it was too dark and only left the mask, and although interested in the concept of the character, Foley did not like the name, so he came up with the name '''Mankind''', which company head [[Vince McMahon]] liked and approved.<ref name=\"FoleyDVD\">{{cite AV media|date=May 3, 2013|title=Mick Foley: For All Mankind|medium=DVD|publisher=[[WWE Home Video]]}}</ref> Foley arrived in the WWF in 1996 debuting a [[gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that was perhaps his most famous personality: Mankind was a mentally deranged schizophrenic who constantly squealed (even throughout his matches), shrieked ''\"Mommy!\"'', spoke to a rat named George, enjoyed pain, physically abused himself (such as by pulling out his hair) and wore a mask; Mankind's finishing move was the [[professional wrestling hold#mandible claw|Mandible Claw]] nerve hold, which involved sticking his ring and middle fingers in his opponent's mouth. His catchphrase was \"Have a nice day!\" and he lived in [[Mechanical room|boiler rooms]]; hence, his specialty match, the [[Professional wrestling match types#Boiler Room Brawl|Boiler Room Brawl]].<ref name=\"IGN\"/> This specific match was a chaotic, dangerous and sometimes violent match that took place inside an arena's mechanical/boiler room, with all sorts of exposed metal piping with large bolts, concrete flooring and solid electrical equipment everywhere, and it was a no disqualification match, so foreign objects were allowed, and the match's objective was to escape the boiler room first.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://wrestlingnews.co/columns/who-really-gets-credit-for-creating-the-boiler-room-brawl/ |title = Who really gets credit for creating the Boiler Room Brawl?|date = August 15, 2017 |accessdate=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\nOn the April 1, 1996, episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' in [[San Bernardino, California]], the day after [[WrestleMania XII]], Mankind debuted on TV and defeated [[Hardcore Holly|Bob \u201cSpark Plug\u201d Holly]], quickly moving into a feud with [[The Undertaker]]. The creatively inclined and dedicated Foley initially would prepare for playing Mankind by researching the character, often spending the night in the respective arena's boiler room and sometimes under the wrestling ring for the first few months, but after that he could get into character almost instantly. The two then began interfering in the other's matches until they were booked in the first-ever Boiler Room Brawl, and in addition to escaping the arena's boiler room, the combatant also had to reach the ring and take the urn from Paul Bearer. After 30 minutes of brawling in the boiler room, the backstage corridors and the entrance ramp, and both men taking some bumps involving metal trash cans, tables, ladders, metal poles, hot coffee and the exposed concrete floor, The Undertaker appeared to have won, but Paul Bearer refused to hand him the urn, allowing Mankind to win, thus (for the time being) ending the relationship between Paul and The Undertaker. While Mankind was managed by Paul Bearer, he referred to him as \"Uncle Paul\". Mankind then became the number one contender to face the then WWF Champion [[Shawn Michaels]] at [[In Your House 10: Mind Games|In Your House: Mind Games]]. Michaels won by disqualification via interference by [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] and The Undertaker.\n\nThe Mankind and Undertaker rivalry continued with the first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Buried Alive match|Buried Alive match]] at [[In Your House 11: Buried Alive|In Your House: Buried Alive]]. Undertaker won the match, but Paul Bearer, the [[Terry Gordy|Executioner]], Mankind and other heels attacked The Undertaker and buried him alive. Afterward, The Undertaker challenged Mankind to a match at [[Survivor Series (1996)|Survivor Series]], which the Undertaker won. The feud continued after another match at [[In Your House 14: Revenge of the 'Taker|In Your House: Revenge of the Taker]] for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which Undertaker had won at [[WrestleMania 13]]. Undertaker won the match and Bearer took a leave of absence, continuing the feud. [[Jim Ross]] then began conducting a series of interviews with Mankind. During the interviews, Ross brought up the topic of Foley's home videos and the hippie-inspired character he played in them, Dude Love, as well as his tormented journey in wrestling. The interviews also affected the fans, who began cheering Mankind, turning him into a face.\n\nAround this time, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] and Shawn Michaels won the WWF Tag Team Championships from [[Owen Hart]] and [[Davey Boy Smith|The British Bulldog]], but Michaels was injured and could no longer compete. Mankind tried to replace him, but Austin said he wanted \"nothing to do with a freak\" and resigned himself to facing Hart and the Bulldog alone the next week. Halfway into the match, however, Foley debuted a new persona known as Dude Love, who helped Austin take the victory, becoming the new Tag Team Champions.<ref name=\"Worldtag\">{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestling-titles.com/wwe/wwf-t.html|title=WWWF/WWF/WWE World Tag Team Title history|publisher=Wrestling-titles.com}}</ref> Austin and Foley vacated their tag team titles when Austin suffered a neck injury in a match at [[SummerSlam (1997)|SummerSlam]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]. Dude Love feuded with [[Triple H|Hunter Hearst Helmsley]], as the two competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Falls Count Anywhere match|Falls Count Anywhere match]]. One of Foley's most memorable vignettes aired before the match began, in which Dude Love and Mankind discussed who should wrestle the upcoming match. Eventually, \"they\" decided that it should be Cactus Jack, and Foley's old character made his WWF debut. Cactus Jack won the match with a [[Piledriver (professional wrestling)|piledriver]] through a table. Shortly thereafter, ECW's [[Terry Funk]] joined the WWF as Chainsaw Charlie. At the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|1998 Royal Rumble]], Foley participated under all three personas, Cactus Jack (1st entry), Mankind (16th), and Dude Love (28th). Charlie and Jack defeated [[the New Age Outlaws]] at [[WrestleMania XIV]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#dumpster match|Dumpster match]] to win the tag team titles (which was originally supposed to be a barbed-wire rope match- but this very often violent and bloody match was scrapped due to the high profile appearance of [[Mike Tyson]] taking part at the event). The next night, however, [[Vince McMahon]] stripped them of the belts and scheduled a rematch in a steel cage, which the Outlaws won with help from their new allies, [[D-Generation X]]. On April 6, 1998, Foley turned heel when Cactus Jack explained the fans would not see him anymore because they did not appreciate him and only cared about Stone Cold Steve Austin. [[Vince McMahon]] explained to Austin the next week that he would face a \"mystery\" opponent at [[Unforgiven: In Your House|Unforgiven]]. That opponent turned out to be Dude Love, who won the match by disqualification, meaning that Austin retained the title. McMahon, displeased with the outcome, required Foley to prove he deserved another shot at Austin's title with a number one contenders match against his former partner, Terry Funk. The match was both the WWF's first-ever \"[[Hardcore wrestling|Hardcore match]]\" and the first time that Foley wrestled under his name. Foley won, and after the match, a proud McMahon came out to Dude Love's music and presented Foley with the Dude Love costume. At [[Over the Edge: In Your House|Over the Edge]], Dude Love took on Austin for the title. McMahon designated his subordinates [[Gerald Brisco]] and [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] as the timekeeper and ring announcer, and made himself the special referee. The Undertaker, however, came to ringside to ensure McMahon called the match fairly, and with his presence, Dude Love lost the match and was \"fired\" by McMahon on the June 1 episode of ''Raw''.\n\nOn that same episode of ''Raw'', Foley reverted to his Mankind character, who began wearing an untucked shirt with a loose necktie and resumed his feud with The Undertaker. At [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]] in Pittsburgh\u2019s [[Civic Arena (Pittsburgh)|Civic Arena]] on June 28, the two performed in the [[the Undertaker vs. Mankind|third]] [[Hell in a Cell match]], which became one of most notable matches in professional wrestling history. Foley received numerous injuries and took two dangerous and highly influential [[Bump (professional wrestling)|bumps]]- the first being tossed off the top of the 16 foot high Cell by The Undertaker, crashing through the wooden Spanish announcer's table and landing on the arena's concrete floor. Barely five minutes after the first bump Foley, with a separated shoulder climbed back up to the top of the Cell after Terry Funk and others tried to stop him, and the second bump, which was an unplanned botch- The Undertaker Chokeslammed Foley, and the fenced panel Foley landed on broke and gave way, so Foley fell 13 feet and landed on the ring mat. Mankind lost the match to conclude their storyline.\n\n==== WWF Champion (1998\u20132000) ====\n{{main|The Rock 'n' Sock Connection}}\nAlthough conventional wisdom holds that the Hell in a Cell match was responsible for Foley's rise to main event status, live television crowds did not initially get behind Mankind because of the match.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Following a couple of months of teaming with [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] who together won the WWF Tag Team Championship on two separate occasions and various feuds with Kane, Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Undertaker, Foley decided that crowds might respond better if Mankind were more of a comedy character, and so he abandoned the tortured soul characteristics and became more of a goofy, broken down oaf. He began the transition into this character following [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]] in 1998 after Kane turned on him and the two lost the tag team championships.\n\nThe following month, Foley began an angle with Vince McMahon, with Mankind trying to be a friend to the hated Mr. McMahon. On the October 5 episode of ''Raw'', while McMahon was in a hospital nursing wounds suffered at the hands of The Undertaker and Kane, Mankind arrived with a female clown called Yurple in an attempt to cheer him up. Having succeeded only in irritating McMahon, Mankind then took a sock off his foot to create a sock puppet named '''\"Mr. Socko\"'''. Intended to be a one-time joke, Socko became an overnight sensation. Mankind began putting the sock on his hand before applying his finisher, the [[professional wrestling hold#mandible claw|Mandible Claw]], stuffing a smelly sock in the mouths of opposing wrestlers. The sweat sock became massively popular with the fans, mainly because it was marketed (mostly by [[Jerry Lawler|Jerry \"The King\" Lawler]] during the events) as being a dirty, smelly, sweaty, repulsive, and vile sock. McMahon manipulated Mankind, who saw the WWF owner as a father figure, into doing his bidding. McMahon created the [[WWE Hardcore Championship|Hardcore Championship]] and awarded it to Mankind, making him the first-ever champion of the hardcore division. Mankind was then pushed as the favorite to win the [[WWE World Championship|WWF Championship]] at [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], as McMahon appeared to be manipulating the tournament so that Mankind would win. He and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] both reached the finals, where McMahon turned on Mankind. As The Rock placed Mankind in the [[Sharpshooter (professional wrestling)|Sharpshooter]], McMahon ordered the timekeeper to ring the bell even though Mankind did not submit, a reference to the [[Montreal Screwjob]] from the year before. As a result of Survivor Series, Mankind officially turned face, while The Rock turned heel and became the crown jewel in McMahon's new [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]] faction.\n\nAfter weeks of trying to get his hands on McMahon's new faction, the [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|Corporation]], Mankind received a title shot against [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. Mankind won the match by using his mandible claw hold (with the 'Mr. Socko' prop on his hand) and the referee declared The Rock had become unresponsive. But McMahon overruled the title change because Mankind didn't keep his pre-match promise to make The Rock submit. After several weeks of going after the Corporation, Mankind defeated The Rock to win his first WWF Championship on December 29 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. The taped show was broadcast on January 4, 1999, so that is the date WWE recognizes as beginning the title run. Having title changes on broadcast television rather than pay-per-view was uncommon in professional wrestling, but because of the [[Monday Night Wars#1997\u20131999: Attitude Era|Monday Night Wars]], TV ratings became more important. The head of rival promotion WCW [[Eric Bischoff]], attempting to take advantage of the fact that their show ''Monday Nitro'' aired live while Mankind's title victory was taped the week before, had announcer [[Tony Schiavone]] reveal the ending of the Mankind-Rock match before it aired. He then added sarcastically, \"That'll put a lot of butts in the seats.\" The move backfired for WCW, as [[Nielsen ratings]] showed that Raw won the ratings battle that night, despite the [[The Fingerpoke of Doom|Hulk Hogan vs. Kevin Nash main event]] which led to the reformation of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]]. Foley said that the ratings indicate that large numbers of viewers switched from ''Nitro'' to ''Raw'' to see him win the title and took great personal pride from this.\n\nMankind lost the WWF Championship to The Rock in an [[\"I Quit\" match]] at [[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]] at the [[Arrowhead Pond]] in [[Anaheim, California]] near [[Los Angeles]], in what is regarded as one of the company's most brutal matches. During the match, Foley took several violent and dangerous bumps from [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] all over the arena, including repeated steel chair shots to the head and a fall from the stands onto solid electrical objects, which sparked upon impact. Although steel chair shots to the head were commonplace in the Attitude Era, the most a wrestler would take in a single ten-minute match was two, or sometimes three, with their hands in front of their head to ease the blow and lessen a chance of a concussion- but Foley had taken '''''eleven''''' in the span of two and a half minutes- all unprotected because he had been handcuffed just before The Rock began his repeated onslaught. Foley was originally supposed to take five chair shots to the head with the final match-ending shot being two-thirds up the entrance ramp, but after the fifth shot, Foley was still at ringside, and even after Foley signaled to The Rock to hit him in the back, The Rock decided to keep to the match's brutal tone based on Foley's previous calling of similar shots on the spot, and he hit Foley six more times in the head until they got to the two-thirds mark. This match is featured in Barry Blaustein's documentary ''[[Beyond the Mat]]'', which shows the impact the match had on Foley, his family and even the rest of the audience at ringside, and at one point Foley's five-year-old daughter Noelle cried and screamed in horror, believing her father was dying as The Rock pummeled Foley with repeated chair shots. The match got to a point that people sitting in the front of the audience screamed and signalled at the referee and The Rock to stop the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadspin.com/twenty-years-ago-the-rock-beat-mick-foley-about-the-he-1832057103|title=Twenty Years Ago, The Rock Beat Mick Foley About The Head And It Was Fucked Up|accessdate=August 9, 2019 |author=David Bixenspan |url-status=live}}</ref> The match ended after Mankind lost consciousness, and The Rock's allies played a recording of Mankind saying \"I Quit\" from an earlier interview he did with Shane McMahon. \n\nMankind won the title back in a rematch on Halftime Heat, which aired during halftime of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], in the WWF's first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Empty Arena match|Empty Arena match]] in [[Tucson, Arizona]] on January 31. After 20 minutes of brawling in the ring, the empty grandstands, a kitchen, the arena's hallways, an office, and the catering hall, Mankind used a [[forklift]] to pin The Rock in a basement loading area. The two then competed in a [[Professional wrestling match types|Last Man Standing match]] at [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre: In Your House|St. Valentine's Day Massacre]], which ended without a winner, meaning that Mankind retained the title. The next night, Mr. McMahon booked a ladder match for the championship, which The Rock won with help from [[Paul Wight|The Big Show]]. Mankind would go on to [[WrestleMania XV|WrestleMania]] to defeat The Big Show and again at [[Backlash (1999)|Backlash]] a month later in a violent and brutal Boiler Room Brawl (the first in the WWF since July 1996), where the objective of the match had been simplified from the 1996 match to just escape the boiler room. Shortly after Big Show would team with Mankind, Test and Shamrock to take on the Corporation at Over The Edge. Later in the year, Foley and The Rock patched up their friendship and teamed up to form a comedy team called [[the Rock 'n' Sock Connection]], becoming one of the most popular teams during that time. The pair won the tag team titles on three occasions. One notable match was a Buried Alive match that pitted the Rock \u2018n\u2019 Sock Connection against The Undertaker and The Big Show, who were out for revenge after losing the tag titles one week earlier. This match included a spot where The Big Show tossed Mankind off the stage, landing hard on the dirt and falling into the grave- Mankind traveled nearly 25 feet in total. Foley then helped ''Raw'' achieve its highest [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] ever with a segment featuring himself (as Mankind) and The Rock. The \"This Is Your Life\" segment aired on September 27, 1999, and received an 8.4 rating, with Yurple the Clown making another appearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashwrestling.com/raw/990927.html |title=Slashwrestling Raw report \u2013 with ratings |accessdate=January 13, 2007 |author=Christopher Robin Zimmerman |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102112807/http://slashwrestling.com/raw/990927.html |archivedate=November 2, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn August 1999, Foley returned after a three-month absence recovering from knee surgery to resume his feud with [[Triple H]], who had kayfabe injured Foley's left knee with his sledgehammer. On an episode of ''Raw'', Mankind drew with Triple H in a match for the number one contender for the WWF Championship, which resulted in a Triple Threat match between Steve Austin, Triple H and Mankind at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]] for the title. Foley won the WWF Championship for the third time at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], pinning the reigning champion Austin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamWrestlingArchive/aug23_fol.html|last=Powell|first=John|title=Mick Foley New Champion at SummerSlam!|publisher=SLAM!

The next night on ''Raw'', Triple H defeated Mankind to win his first WWF championship. A feud then developed between Mankind and the McMahon-Helmsley regime, led by Triple H. This included Triple H defeating Mankind in another Boiler Room Brawl on the September 23 edition of ''Smackdown!'', as part of a five-match \u201cgauntlet\u201c challenge set upon Triple H by Vince McMahon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWXn5CtCYOk&t=1s|title=Triple H vs Mankind (Boiler Room Brawl) - Sept 23, 1999|accessdate=June 30, 2019 |author=WWE}}</ref>\n\nMankind continued his feud with Triple H when he was supposed to have the last Boiler Room Brawl match with \"[[Santa Claus]]\".

Foley then reverted to his Cactus Jack persona in January 2000 and faced Triple H for the WWF Championship at [[Royal Rumble (2000)|Royal Rumble]] in a [[Hardcore wrestling|Street Fight]]. Cactus used a 2x4 wrapped in barbed wire, and thumbtacks- trademark weapons from his pre-WWF days, but Triple H won the match after delivering two pedigrees, the second slamming Cactus face-first onto a pile of tacks. This feud culminated with a rematch at [[No Way Out (2000)|No Way Out]] in a Hell in a Cell match, where stipulations held that Cactus Jack could not use foreign metallic objects he used in the Royal Rumble, and if he did not win the title, Foley had to retire from wrestling. During the match, they had made their way onto the top of the cell and Foley was preparing to Piledrive Triple H onto a barbed wire 2x4 on fire, but Triple H reversed it into a backdrop, causing the cage to give way, Foley fell through the canvas.

Foley has said that he intended for his Commissioner Foley character to be a \"role model for nerds,\" cracking lame jokes and making no attempt to appear tough or scary. He also had a knack during this time to have no one spot for his office; rather, Mick would have an office in all sorts of odd places (for example, closets). Foley turned getting [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#pop|cheap pops]] into something of a catchphrase, as he shamelessly declared at each WWF show that he was thrilled to be \"right here in (whatever city in which he was performing (e.g., New York))!\" punctuated with an intentionally cheesy thumbs-up gesture. During this time, Commissioner Foley engaged in rivalries with [[Kurt Angle]], [[Edge and Christian]], and Vince McMahon without actually wrestling them. He left the position in December 2000 after being \"fired\" onscreen by McMahon during which he received a brutal beat down.\n\nFoley made a surprise return on the ''Raw'' just before [[WrestleMania X-Seven]] and announced that he would be the [[referee (professional wrestling)#Special referee|special guest referee]] in the match between Mr. McMahon and his son Shane at WrestleMania. After WrestleMania, Foley made sporadic appearances on WWF programming throughout the middle of the year, at one point introducing Minnesota Governor [[Jesse Ventura]] during a taping of ''Raw'' in the state as a foil to Mr. McMahon, as well as serving as the guest referee for the Earl Hebner versus Nick Patrick Referee match and a tag-team bra and panties match between WWF wrestlers [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] & [[Trish Stratus]] vs WCW stars [[Stacy Keibler]] & [[Torrie Wilson]] at the [[WWF Invasion]] pay-per-view. Foley returned as commissioner in October 2001, near the end of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] angle. During this brief tenure, Foley had the opportunity to [[Shoot (professional wrestling)|shoot]] on the WWF's direction and how dissatisfied he was with it. Saying that there were far too many championships in the company, he booked unification matches before the final pay-per-view of the storyline, [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]]. After Survivor Series, he ended his commissionership at Vince McMahon's request and left the company.\n\n=== Independent circuit (2003\u20132005) ===\nDuring his absences from WWE, Foley made frequent appearances on the [[independent circuit]] from 2003 to 2005, primarily in non-wrestling roles, either as a referee, manager, or special guest.\n\nHis first independent circuit appearance was on December 12, 2003 for International Wrestling Cartel, where he was the special guest referee for a match between [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] and [[Jerry Lawler]].\n\nFoley did not appear on the independent circuit again until May 2004, when he appeared for the Japanese promotion [[HUSTLE]] and returned to the ring to face [[Toshiaki Kawada]] for the [[Triple Crown Heavyweight Championship]], but ended up losing.\n\nOn September 11, 2004, Foley made his debut for [[Ring of Honor]] and cut a promo, praising ROH and referring to it as \"Ring of Hardcore\", thus establishing himself as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]]. On October 3, Foley refereed a match between Jerry Lawler and [[Slyck Wagner Brown]] for the New England Wrestling promotion. On October 15, Foley returned to ROH where he confronted [[Ricky Steamboat]], who claimed that traditional wrestling was better than hardcore wrestling. The next day, both Foley and Steamboat cut promos on each other, leading to a match between two teams of wrestlers handpicked by both men, with [[Nigel McGuiness]] and [[Chad Collyer]] representing Steamboat and [[Dan Maff]] and [[B.J. Whitmer]] representing Foley, which was won by McGuiness and Collyer. On November 6, Foley teased a heel turn when he called [[ROH World Championship|ROH Champion]] [[Samoa Joe]] \"softcore\". On November 20, Foley made a surprise appearance for New York Wrestling Connection, making a run-in during [[Mikey Whipwreck]] and Ken Scampi's match against Mayhem and Tony Burma, where he helped Whipwreck and Scampi win.\n\nFoley made an appearance on the [[A Night of Appreciation for Sabu|Night of Appreciation for Sabu]], where he refereed the match between [[Shane Douglas]] and Raven, where Sabu himself interfered in the match and helped Douglas win.\n\nFoley returned to ROH on December 26 at ROH's Final Battle event and had his final confrontation with Ricky Steamboat, where the two made peace. On January 15, 2005, Foley turned heel after he was confronted by Samoa Joe and hit Joe over the head with a steel chair. One week later, Foley appeared with [[Border City Wrestling]] to referee the match between [[Alex Shelley]] and [[Chris Sabin]] for the BCW Television Championship, which Sabin won.\n\nFoley refereed the main event of the first [[WrestleReunion]] show, which saw Dusty Rhodes, [[Goldust|Dustin Rhodes]], and [[Mike Graham (wrestler)|Mike Graham]] battle [[Abdullah the Butcher]], [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]], and [[CM Punk]].\n\nOn February 19, Foley resumed his feud with Samoa Joe in ROH, teasing a return to the ring but instead choosing [[Vordell Walker]] to fight Joe. After Joe defeated Walker, Foley introduced his \"backup plan\" New Cactus Jack to fight Joe in a second match, which Joe won as well.\n\nOn February 26, Foley appeared with Frank Goodman's USA Xtreme promotion, cutting a promo saying that there was no need to wait until June for an ECW reunion (referring to the upcoming [[Hardcore Homecoming]] show being put together by Shane Douglas), and brought out [[Axl Rotten]], Shane Douglas, [[Chris Candido]], [[Tammy Lynn Sytch|Tammy Sytch]], [[Balls Mahoney]], [[Al Snow]], [[Justin Credible]], [[The Sandman (wrestler)|The Sandman]], Terry Funk and Sabu, much to the excitement of the crowd, who began an \"E-C-Dub!\" chant. But then Raven came out and cut a promo saying that he had only ever been the one true star of ECW and everyone else had just been a [[Job (professional wrestling)|jobber]], leading to a match between Raven and Balls Mahoney later in the night, which Raven won by DQ when he threw fire in Mahoney's eyes. After this, Foley and several of the other ECW alumni came to the ring and attacked Raven.\n\nOn April 2, Foley appeared with [[Harley Race]]'s [[World League Wrestling]] to referee a match between [[William Mueller|Trevor Rhodes]] and Brandon Bishop, which was ruled a No-Contest. After the match, Rhodes, Bishop, and Johnny Gold all attacked Foley until Terry Funk and Harley Race ran in and fought the three wrestlers off. Afterwards, Foley left the arena with Funk and Race.\n\nOn April 30, Foley refereed a match at a Northeast Wrestling show between Jerry Lawler and [[King Kong Bundy]], which Lawler won.\n\nOn May 7, Foley made a return to the ring at the Mark Curtis Memorial Show, where he was victorious in a tag team match with Shane Douglas against Al Snow and [[D'Lo Brown]], which also featured [[Dominic DeNucci]] (Foley and Douglas' trainer) in his and Douglas' corner.\n\nThe main event of the ECW reunion show Hardcore Homecoming was Terry Funk against Sabu and Shane Douglas in a Triple Threat Elimination No Ropes Barbed Wire Match. During the middle of the match, [[Bill Alfonso]], who was in Sabu's corner, began pulling Shane Douglas into the wire, which led to [[Francine Fournier|Francine]], who was in Douglas' corner, attacking Alfonso. Using this as a distraction, Douglas brought a ladder into the ring when suddenly the lights in the arena went out. When they came back on, Foley was in the ring, as Cactus Jack, wearing a referee shirt. Foley pulled out a barbed-wire wrapped Mr. Socko and applied the Mandible Claw on Douglas, then DDT'd Douglas onto a steel chair. Terry Funk then crawled onto Douglas and eliminated him when Foley made the 3-count. After that, Funk targeted Sabu, throwing him into the barbed wire, then setting up a table and putting Sabu on it. Funk then climbed up the ladder, but before he got far, it collapsed from under his weight, sending him crashing through the table. Sabu then recovered, gave Funk an Arabian Facebuster off a chair, and pinned Funk to win the match. After the match ended, all four of them were greeted with chants of \"Terry!\" and \"Sabu!\" and \"Foley!\" and \"Thank You Shane!\" and of course \"E-C-Dub! E-C-Dub!\". The entire locker room emptied moments later and celebrated with Funk, Sabu, Foley, and Douglas in the ring to continued \"E-C-Dub\" chants.\n\nOn July 8, Foley returned to ROH as a face, confronting ROH Champion CM Punk, who had turned heel and mocked ROH and the championship after he had signed with WWE and threatened to take the title with him to WWE. Foley acted as a direct line to Vince McMahon, attempting to convince Punk to defend his title one last time on McMahon's orders before he departed from ROH.\n\nOn August 13, Foley made an appearance with Ballpark Brawl to make fun of [[Matthew Kaye|Matt Striker]], who had been doing an impersonation of The Rock. Later in the event, Foley refereed the Canes, Tables, and Chairs match between Sandman and Sabu, which Sandman won. After the match, Foley celebrated with Sandman by drinking beer with him in the middle of the ring.\n\nOn August 20, Foley returned to ROH again, as a face, to rescue [[Jade Chung]] from [[Prince Nana]]. Foley was then attacked from behind by Alex Shelley and [[The Embassy (professional wrestling)|The Embassy]] until [[Austin Aries]] and [[Roderick Strong]] chased them off. One week later, Foley returned to the ring for the second WrestleReunion show to team with Terry Funk and [[Dory Funk, Jr.]] in a losing effort against the [[The Midnight Express (professional wrestling)|Midnight Express]] ([[Stan Lane]], [[Bobby Eaton]], and [[Dennis Condrey]].)\n\nFoley made his final regular appearance with ROH on September 17, when he was in [[A.J. Styles]]' corner in a match against Embassy member [[Jimmy Rave]], which Styles won. Afterwards, Foley put over ROH huge saying he enjoyed being on ROH shows and would speak highly of it.\n\nFoley made his final major independent circuit appearance on the Tribute to ''Starrcade'' show on November 19 as the referee for the match between Dustin Rhodes and Terry Funk, which ended in a No-Contest.\n\n=== Return to WWE ===\n====Various feuds (2003&ndash;2006)====\nFoley returned in June 2003 to referee the [[Hell in a Cell]] match between Triple H and [[Kevin Nash]] at Bad Blood. On June 23, during a ''Raw'' broadcast in [[Madison Square Garden]], he was honored for his achievements in the ring and presented with the retired [[WWE Hardcore Championship]] belt. The evening ended with Foley taking a beating and kicked down a flight of stairs by [[Randy Orton]] and [[Ric Flair]]. In December 2003, Foley returned to replace Steve Austin as co-general manager of ''Raw''. He soon grew tired of the day-to-day travel and left his full-time duties to write and spend time with his family. In the storyline, Foley was afraid to wrestle a match with Intercontinental Champion [[Randy Orton]] on the December 15 episode of ''Raw'' and walked out of the match rather than face him, the result of the match was ruled a draw. After Foley walked backstage, Orton confronted him asking why he walked out of the match, calling him a coward in the process, before spitting in his face. Foley walked out of the arena afterwards.\n\nIn 2004, Foley returned briefly to wrestling, competing in the [[Royal Rumble]] and eliminating both Orton and himself with his trademark Cactus Jack clothesline. He and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]] reunited as the Rock 'n' Sock Connection and lost a handicap match to [[Evolution (professional wrestling)|Evolution]] at [[WrestleMania XX]]. Foley and Orton continued to feud, culminating in a [[Hardcore wrestling|hardcore match]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] at [[Backlash (2004)|Backlash]], where a thumbtack-covered Orton defeated Foley, as his Cactus Jack persona, to retain the title after hitting Foley with his signature move, the ''RKO'' onto a barbed wire covered baseball bat. Foley regards this match as possibly the best of his career.<ref>Foley, Mick. The Hardcore Diaries (p.260)</ref>\n\nFoley appeared as a color commentator at WWE's [[ECW One Night Stand (2005)|ECW One Night Stand]], which aired on June 12, 2005, and subsequently renewed his contract with WWE. Foley returned in 2005 in a match where fans were able to vote on which persona he would appear as\u2014Mankind, Dude Love, or Cactus Jack\u2014against [[Carly Col\u00f3n|Carlito]] at [[Taboo Tuesday (2005)|Taboo Tuesday]]. The fans voted for Mankind, who went on to win the match- this was the last time Foley ever wrestled as Mankind. On the February 16, 2006, ''Raw'', Foley returned to referee the WWE Championship match between [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[John Cena]]. After Cena won, Edge attacked Foley, and the following week, Foley challenged Edge to a match at [[WrestleMania 22]]. In the intensely brutal match, the heavily bloodied and thumbtack-covered Edge defeated Foley after spearing him through a flaming table, where both performers suffered second-degree burns after anti-flame material was not applied to the flaming table, at their own request.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dt54lUPqWEk|title=Bruce Prichard shoots on Edge vs Mick Foley at Wrestlemania|accessdate=July 31, 2019|date=December 27, 2018}}</ref> In the weeks after the match, an \"impressed\" Foley turned heel and allied himself with Edge against the newly rejuvenated [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]]. At [[ECW One Night Stand (2006)|ECW One Night Stand]], Foley, Edge and [[Lita (wrestler)|Lita]] defeated Terry Funk, [[Tommy Dreamer]] and [[Beulah McGillicutty]] in a violent and brutal tag-team hardcore match, which included a spot where Funk hit Foley with a barbed wire 2x4 plank lit on fire, and the flame latched onto Foley, and he then fell onto a plywood board covered in more barbed wire.\n\nFoley then engaged in a storyline rivalry with [[Ric Flair]], inspired by real-life animosity between the two. In ''Have a Nice Day!'', Foley wrote that Flair was \"every bit as bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it.\" In response, Flair wrote in his autobiography that Foley was \"a glorified stuntman\" and that he was able to climb the ladder in the WWF only because he was friends with the bookers. The two had a backstage confrontation at a ''Raw'' event in December 2004 in [[Huntsville]], [[Alabama]], but Foley has said that they have largely reconciled.<ref name=SlamFoleyRicFlair>{{cite web|last=Baines|first=Tim|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2004/06/27/516827.html|title= Ric Flair Critical of Mick Foley in New Book|publisher=SLAM!

Tazz filled in for Foley as a color commentator on ''SmackDown'', while Raw wrestler [[Matt Striker]] filled in for Tazz on ''[[ECW (WWE)|ECW]]''. Foley told Long Island Press pro wrestling columnist Josh Stewart in August 2008 that \"creatively, the announcing job wasn't working out too well\".

Two weeks later, Foley made his full television debut in a promo making comments about the [[List of WWE personnel|WWE roster]], Vince McMahon and [[Kurt Angle]]. At [[Bound for Glory IV]], he was the special guest enforcer for Jarrett and Angle's match. Later, on ''Impact!'', Foley said goodbye, but was then approached by Jeff Jarrett with a new offer; he later indicated that they had come to terms on a new contract and would make a major announcement the next week. On the October 23 episode of ''Impact!'', Foley announced that he was now co-owner of TNA along with Jarrett, just after Kurt Angle headbutted him.\n\nOn November 27, Thanksgiving Day, TNA presented the Turkey Bowl. [[Alex Shelley]] ended up being pinned by [[Rhino (wrestler)|Rhino]], and Foley handed Rhino the check. Afterwards, the defeated Shelley had to put on a Turkey Suit in compliance with the match rules, albeit with much refusal. However, Shelley \"[[Finger (gesture)|flipped off]]\" Foley and proceeded to beat him up. In the aftermath, Mick mentioned that Shelley is lucky he still has his job. [[The Main Event Mafia]]'s [[Kevin Nash]], [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]], and [[Scott Steiner]] were going to take on [[D-Von Dudley|Brother Devon]], [[A.J. Styles]], and Mick Foley in his debut matchup at [[Genesis (2009)|Genesis]]. Nash, however, suffered a legitimate staph infection and missed Genesis. He was replaced by [[Monty Sopp|Cute Kip]]. Foley got the pin when he hit Scott Steiner with a double arm DDT onto a chair.\n\nOn April 19, 2009 at [[Lockdown (2009)|Lockdown]], he defeated [[Sting (wrestler)|Sting]] to win the [[TNA World Heavyweight Championship]] for his first-ever championship in TNA, and his fourth World title overall. Mick did not lose the championship, but Sting became the new leader of the Main Event Mafia by pinning Kurt Angle at [[Sacrifice (2009)|Sacrifice]]. Foley had also stated on ''[[TNA Impact!|Impact!]]'' tapings that if he retained the TNA World Heavyweight Title at the [[King of the Mountain match]] at [[Slammiversary (2009)|Slammiversary]], he would only put the title up in a match once a year. However, he lost the title to Kurt Angle in the King of The Mountain match at Slammiversary. He received a rematch at [[Victory Road (2009)|Victory Road]], commenting he had only submitted once in his career (to Terry Funk, in a [[Professional wrestling holds#Spinning toe hold|spinning toe hold]]) and swore he'd never do it again. He lost the match when Angle forced him to submit again with the [[ankle lock]].\n\nOn July 30, 2009, the 200th episode of ''Impact!'', Foley won the [[TNA Global Championship|TNA Legends Championship]] by pinning champion Kevin Nash in a tag team match where Nash teamed with Angle and Foley with [[Bobby Lashley]]. At [[Hard Justice (2009)|Hard Justice]], Nash defeated Foley to regain the title, following interference from [[Tracy Brookshaw|Traci Brooks]].\n\n==== Various storylines (2009\u20132011) ====\nOn the edition of September 24 of ''Impact!''

In 2015, Foley appeared at [[SummerSlam (2015)|SummerSlam]], where he kicked off the event with host [[Jon Stewart]]. Foley returned to ''Raw'' on March 14, 2016 in a backstage segment with Dean Ambrose, in which he gave him a pep talk for his upcoming [[WrestleMania 32]] match against [[Brock Lesnar]] and a passing of the torch in the form of his iconic barbed wire baseball bat, \"Barbie\". On April 3, 2016 at [[WrestleMania 32]], Foley returned in-ring alongside [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] in a post-match interruption where the trio of Hall of Famers took on [[The League of Nations (professional wrestling)|The League of Nations]] after they had defeated [[The New Day (wrestling)|The New Day]] and proclaimed \"No three people can ever defeat us.\" Foley brought out Mr. Socko and executed the Mandible Claw two times during the fight, once on [[Sheamus]] and once on [[Wade Barrett|King Barrett]].

Foley has since unveiled new titles exclusive to the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw brand]], while also making fair decisions to favor the faces and occasionally disagreeing with Stephanie McMahon. One of Foley's first decisions as Raw General Manager was pitting the feuding [[Sheamus]] and [[Cesaro (wrestler)|Cesaro]] against one another in a Best of 7 series. Going into [[WWE Clash of Champions|Clash of Champions]] the duo were tied 3-3. At Clash of Champions, both men would be counted out resulting in a draw and the best of seven series being declared a draw.

On the November 21 episode of ''Raw'', Foley would place [[Sami Zayn]] in a match against [[Braun Strowman]] after Zayn failed to defeat [[The Miz]] at [[Survivor Series (2016)|Survivor Series]] for the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] to bring the title to ''Raw''. During the match, Foley would order the match to be stopped, deeming Zayn unable to continue. The following week on ''Raw'', Zayn would demand a rematch against Strowman, but Foley would decline, telling Zayn he could not beat him, making Zayn storm off in anger. On the December 12 episode of ''Raw'', Zayn would once again ask for a rematch with Strowman but was once again rejected by Foley. Zayn would then tell Foley he was pondering going to ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]'' because Foley did not believe in him. Later that night, after Zayn defeated [[Jinder Mahal]], Foley would tell him he has arranged a trade with ''SmackDown'' for him in exchange for [[Eva Marie]]. Zayn would angrily refuse the trade and once again demanded a rematch with Strowman. Foley would yield, giving Zayn his match with Strowman at [[Roadblock: End of the Line]] with a ten-minute time limit.\n\nOn the March 13, 2017 episode of ''Raw'', Stephanie McMahon forced Foley to fire a member of the ''Raw'' roster by the end of the night. Foley chose to fire Stephanie McMahon herself, which prompted [[Triple H]] to come out and confront Foley. After being insulted and ordered to leave the ring, Foley instead attacked Triple H, stuffing a sock in Triple H's mouth via ''Mr. Socko'' before being low blowed by McMahon. [[Seth Rollins]] would then come out to aid Foley, only to be attacked by Triple H. On the March 20 episode of ''Raw'', Stephanie McMahon would fire Foley for his actions the previous week. A few weeks later Foley made an appearance at the WWE Hall of Fame [[WWE Hall of Fame (2017)|class of 2017]] ceremony.\n\n====Return to Raw (2018\u2013present)====\nOn the September 10, 2018 episode of ''Raw''.

{"title_page": "Overlapping markup", "text_new": "In [[markup language]]s and the [[digital humanities]], '''overlap''' occurs when a document has two or more structures that interact in a non-[[hierarchical]] manner.\nA document with overlapping markup cannot be represented as a [[tree (graph)|tree]].\nThis is also known as '''concurrent markup'''.\nOverlap happens, for instance, in [[poetry]], where there may be a [[meter (poetry)|metrical]] structure of [[foot (prosody)|feet]] and lines; a linguistic structure of sentences and quotations; and a physical structure of volumes and pages and editorial annotations.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Frankenstein.1831.inside-cover.jpg|thumb|right|The structural differences between multiple editions of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' have been analysed with overlapping techniques.{{sfn|Piez|2014}}]]\n\nThe problem of non-hierarchical structures in documents has been recognised since 1988; resolving it against the dominant paradigm of text as a single hierarchy (an ''ordered hierarchy of content objects'' or ''OHCO'') was initially thought to be merely a technical issue, but has, in fact, proven much more difficult.{{sfn|Renear|Mylonas|Durand|1993}}\nIn 2008, [[Jeni Tennison]] identified markup overlap as \"the main remaining problem area for markup technologists\".{{sfn|Tennison|2008}}\nMarkup overlap continues to be a primary issue in the digital study of theological texts in 2019, and is a major reason for the field retaining specialised markup formats&mdash;the [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] and the [[Theological Markup Language]]&mdash;rather than the inter-operable [[Text Encoding Initiative]]-based formats common to the rest of the [[digital humanities]].{{sfn|MoChridhe|2019}}\n\n== Properties and types ==\n\nA distinction exists between schemes that allow non-contiguous overlap, and those that allow only contiguous overlap. Often, 'markup overlap' strictly means the latter.\nContiguous overlap can always be represented as a linear document with milestones (typically co-indexed start- and end-markers), without the need for fragmenting a (logical) component into multiple physical ones. Non-contiguous overlap may require document fragmentation. Another distinction in overlapping markup schemes is whether elements can overlap with other elements of the same kind (''self-overlap'').{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\nA scheme may have a ''privileged'' hierarchy.\nSome [[XML]]-based schemes, for example, represent one hierarchy directly in the XML document tree, and represent other, overlapping, structures by another means;\nthese are said to be ''non-privileged''.\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012}} identifies a tripartite classification of instances of overlap: 1. \"Variation of content and structure\", 2. \"Overlay of multiple  perspectives or markup sets\", and 3. \"Overlap of individual start and end tags within a single markup perspective\";\nadditionally, some apparent instances of overlap are in fact schema definition problems, which can be resolved hierarchically.\nHe contends that type 1 is best resolved by a system of multiple documents external to the markup, but types 2 and 3 require dealing with internally.\n\n== Approaches and implementations ==\n\n{{harvtxt|DeRose|2004|loc=Evaluation criteria}} identifies several criteria for judging solutions to the overlap problem: \n* readability and maintainability, \n* tool support and compatibility with XML, \n* possible validation schemes, and \n* ease of processing.\n\n[[Tag soup]] is, strictly speaking, not overlapping markup\u2014it is malformed [[HTML]], which is a non-overlapping language, and may be ill-defined.\nSome [[web browsers]] attempted to represent overlapping start and end tags with non-hierarchical [[Document Object Model]]s (DOM), but this was not standardised across all browsers and was incompatible with the innately hierarchical nature of the DOM.{{sfn|Hickson|2002}}{{sfn|Sivonen|2003}}\n[[HTML5]] defines how processors should deal with such mis-nested markup in the HTML syntax and turn it into a single hierarchy.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#an-introduction-to-error-handling-and-strange-cases-in-the-parser \u00a7 8.2.8 An introduction to error handling and strange cases in the parser]}}\nWith [[XHTML]] and [[SGML]]-based HTML, however, mis-nested markup is a strict error and makes processing by standards-compliant systems impossible.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.1. Non-SGML Notations}}\nThe HTML standard defines a [[paragraph]] concept which can cause overlap with other elements and can be non-contiguous.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#paragraphs \u00a7 3.2.5.4 Paragraphs]}}\n\n[[SGML]], which early versions of HTML were based on, has a feature called CONCUR that allows multiple independent hierarchies to co-exist without privileging any.\n[[Document type definition|DTD]] validation is only defined for each individual hierarchy with CONCUR. Validation across hierarchies is not defined by the standard. CONCUR cannot support self-overlap, and it interacts poorly with some of SGML's abbreviatory features.\nThis feature has been poorly supported by tools and has seen very little actual use;\nusing CONCUR to represent document overlap was not a recommended use case, according to a commentary by the standard's editor.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.2. CONCUR}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=SGML CONCUR}}\n\n=== Within hierarchical languages ===\n\nThere are several approaches to representing overlap in a non-overlapping language.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\nThe [[Text Encoding Initiative]], as an XML-based markup scheme, cannot directly represent overlapping markup.\nAll four of the below approaches are suggested.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc = [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html \u00a7 20 Non-hierarchical Structures]}}\nThe [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] is another XML-based scheme, designed to mark up the [[Bible]].\nIt uses empty milestone elements to encode non-privileged components.{{sfn|Durusau|2006}}\n\nTo illustrate these approaches, marking up the sentences and lines of a fragment of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] will be used as a running example. Where there is a privileged hierarchy, the lines will be used.\n\n==== Multiple documents ====\n''Multiple documents'' can each provide different internally consistent hierarchies. The advantage of this approach is that each document is simple and can be processed with existing tools, but requires maintenance of redundant content and it can be difficult to cross-reference between different views.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHME \u00a7 20.1 Multiple Encodings of the Same Information]}} With multiple documents, the overlap can be analysed with [[data comparison]] and [[delta encoding]] techniques, and, in an XML context, specific XML tree differencing algorithms are available.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009}}{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.5 Variation}} recommends this approach for encoding multiple variants of a single text and to accept the duplication of the parts which do not vary, rather than attempting to create a structure that represents all of the variation present;\nfurther, he suggests that this alignment be performed automatically, and that misalignment is rare in practice.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.1 Automating Variation}}\n\nExample, with lines marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</line>\n  <line>So much for that.\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</line>\n</source>\n\nWith sentences marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <sentence>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,\n  Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence>\n  <sentence>So much for that.</sentence><sentence>\u2014The silent hours steal on,\n  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence>\n</source>\n\n==== Milestones ====\n''Milestones'' are empty elements that mark the beginning and end of a component. These can be used to embed a non-privileged structure within a hierarchical language, and can only represent contiguous overlap. Existing tools will also not understand the meaning of the milestone elements and so cannot easily process or validate the non-privileged structure.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHBM \u00a7 20.2 Boundary Marking with Empty Elements]}}{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.4. Milestones}} The markup being near the content is an advantage for maintainability and readability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=TEI-style milestones}} [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]] {{harv|DeRose|2004}} is an example of such an approach.\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence-start />I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.<sentence-end /></line>\n  <line><sentence-start />So much for that.<sentence-end /><sentence-start />\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.<sentence-end /></line>\n</source>\n\n[[Punctuation]] and [[Space (punctuation)|spaces]] have been identified as a type of milestone-style 'crypto-overlap' or 'pseudo-markup', as the boundaries of words, clauses, sentences and the like do not necessarily align with the formal markup boundaries hierarchically.{{sfn|Birnbaum|Thorsen|2015}}{{sfn|Haentjens Dekker|Birnbaum|2017}}\n\n==== Joins ====\n''Joins'' are pointers within a privileged hierarchy to other components of the privileged hierarchy, which may be used to reconstruct a non-privileged component akin to following a [[linked list]]. A single non-privileged element is ''segmented'' into several ''partial'' elements within the privileged hierarchy; the partial elements themselves do not represent a single unit in the non-privileged hierarchy, which can be misleading and make processing difficult.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHVE \u00a7 20.3 Fragmentation and Reconstitution of Virtual Elements]}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Segmentation}} While this approach can support some discontiguous structures, it is not able to re-order elements.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.5. Fragmentation}} A slightly different approach can, however, express re-ordering by expressing the join away from the content, at the cost of directness and maintainability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Joins}}\n\nJoin-based representations can introduce the possibility of cycles between elements; detecting and rejecting these adds complexity to implementations.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.4 Interlinking}}\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"a\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence id=\"b\">So much for that.</sentence><sentence id=\"c\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"c\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence></line>\n</source>\n\n==== Stand-off markup ====\n''Stand-off markup'' is similar to using joins, except that there is no privileged hierarchy: each part of the document is given a label (or might be referred to by an offset), and the document is constructed by pointing to the content from markup that 'stands off' from the content (possibly in an entirely different file), and might contain no content itself. The TEI guidelines identify the unity of the elements as a primary advantage of stand-off markup over joins, in addition to the ability to produce and distribute the annotations separately from the text, possibly even by different authors applying markup to a read-only document,{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc= [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHSO \u00a7 20.4 Stand-off Markup]}} allowing collaborative approaches to markup by a [[wikt:divide and conquer|divide and conquer]] strategy.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.2 Markup Outside the Text}}\n\nIt has been claimed that separating markup and text can result in overall simplification and increased maintainability,{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019|loc=Conclusion}} and by 2017, ``[t]he current state of the art to (...) linguistically annotated data [was] to use a graph-based representation serialized as standoff XML as a pivot format\u00b4\u00b4<ref name=\"habla-99\">{{cite journal |last1=Ide |first1=Nancy |last2=Chiarcos |first2=Christian |last3=Stede |first3=Manfred |last4=Cassidy |first4=Steve |title=Designing Annotation Schemes: From Model to Representation |journal=Nancy Ide & James Pustejowsky (eds.), Handbook of Linguistic Annotation |date=2017 |page=99 |pages=|url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9789402408799 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht}}</ref> \n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <span id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</span>\n  <span id=\"b\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</span>\n  <span id=\"c\">So much for that.</span><span id=\"d\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</span>\n  <span id=\"e\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</span>\n  ...\n  <line contents=\"a\" />\n  <line contents=\"b\" />\n  <line contents=\"c d\" />\n  <line contents=\"e\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"a b\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"c\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"d e\" />\n</source>\n\nStandoff formalisms have been the basis for an ISO standard for linguistic annotation <ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/37326.html</ref>, they have been successfully applied for developing corpus management systems,<ref name=\"habla-p99\">{{cite journal |last1=Chiarcos |first1=Christian |last2=Dipper |first2=Stefanie |last3=G\u00f6tze |first3=Michael |last4=Leser |first4=Ulf |last5=L\u00fcdeling |first5=Anke |last6=Ritz |first6=Julia |last7=Stede |first7=Manfred |title=A flexible framework for integrating annotations from different tools and tagsets |journal=Traitement Automatique des Languages |date=2008 |volume=49 |issue=2 |page=271-293 |url=https://www.atala.org/content/flexible-framework-integrating-annotations-different-tools-and-tag-sets}}</ref> and (as of April 2020) they are actively being developed in the TEI.<ref>https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1745</ref> \n\nA disadvantage of standoff is that validation is very challenging.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.6. Standoff Markup}} \nStandoff formalisms are not natively supported by database management systems, so that (by 2017) it was suggested to ``use ... standoff XML as a pivot format (...) and relational data bases for querying.\u00b4\u00b4<ref name=\"habla-99\"/> In practical applications, this requires complicated architectures and/or labor-intense transformation between pivot format and internal representation. As a result, maintenance is problematic.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|log=Standoff markup}} This has been a motivation to develop corpus management systems on the basis of graph data bases and for using established graph-based formalisms as pivot formats.\n\n=== New languages ===\n\nAnother approach is to design an entirely new markup language.\nThese forego the tool support in existing languages for a less complicated semantic model and more convenient syntax.\n\n* [[LMNL]] is a non-hierarchical markup language first described in 2002 by [[Jeni Tennison]] and [[Wendell Piez]], annotating ranges of a document with properties and allowing self-overlap. [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]], which originally stood for 'Canonical LMNL In XML', provides a method for representing any LMNL document in a milestone-style XML document.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=CLIX and LMNL}} It also has another XML serialisation, xLMNL.{{sfn|Piez|2012}}\n* [[MECS]] was developed by the [[University of Bergen]]'s [[Wittgenstein Archive]]. However, it had several problems: it allowed some non-sensical documents of overlapping elements, it could not support self-overlap, and it did not have the capacity to define a DTD-like grammar.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.7. MECS}} The theory of [[General Ordered-Descendant Directed Acyclic Graph]]s (GODDAGs), while not strictly a markup language itself, is a general data model for non-hierarchical markup. ''Restricted GODDAGs'' were designed specifically to match the semantics of MECS; general GODDAGs may be non-contiguous and need a more powerful language.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000}} [[TexMECS]] is a successor to MECS, which has a formal grammar and is designed to represent every GODDAG and nothing that is not a GODDAG.{{sfn|Huitfeldt|Sperberg-McQueen|2003}}\n* [[XCONCUR]] (previously MuLaX) is a melding-together of XML and SGML's CONCUR, and also contains a validation language, XCONCUR-CL, and a [[Simple API for XML|SAX]]-like API.{{sfn|Hilbert|Schonefeld|Witt|2005}}{{sfn|Witt|Schonefeld|Rehm|Khoo|2007}}{{sfn|Schonefeld|2008}}\n* Marinelli, Vitali and Zacchiroli provide algorithms to convert between restricted GODDAGs, ECLIX, LMNL, parallel documents in XML, contiguous stand-off markup and TexMECS.{{sfn|Marinelli|Vitali|Zacchiroli|2008}}\n\n=== Graph-based formalisms ===\n\nRather than grounding markup information in a tree, standoff XML employs a data model based on directed graphs.{{sfn|Ide|Suderman|2007}}\nAs an alternative to traditional markup, such graph-based data models can be represented with formalisms originally developed for generalised directed [[multigraph]]s, most notably the [[Resource Description Framework|Resource Description Framework (RDF)]].{{sfn|Cassidy|2010|log=cassidy}}{{sfn|Chiarcos|2012|log=POWLA}}\nEARMARK is an early [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] representation that encompasses GODDAGs.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\n\nRDF provides different linearisations, including an XML format that can be modeled to mirror conventional standoff XML, and a linearization that lets RDF be expressed in XML attributes ([[RDFa]]). But while it is semantically equivalent to standoff XML, it does not require special-purpose technology for storing, parsing and querying. Multiple interlinked RDF files representing a document or a corpus may constitute an example of [[Linguistic Linked Open Data]].\n\nEggert & Schmidt describe encoding a corpus (the [[Charles Harpur Critical Archive]]) using 'multi-version documents' (MVD) to represent the variant versions of documents and as a means of indicating additions, deletions and revisions using a tactical combination of multiple documents and stand-off ranges within an underlying graph-based model.

'''overlap''' occurs when a document has two or more structures that interact in a non-[[hierarchical]] manner.\nA document with overlapping markup cannot be represented as a [[tree (graph)|tree]].\nThis is also known as '''concurrent markup'''.\nOverlap happens, for instance, in [[poetry]], where there may be a [[meter (poetry)|metrical]] structure of [[foot (prosody)|feet]] and lines; a linguistic structure of sentences and quotations; and a physical structure of volumes and pages and editorial annotations.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Frankenstein.1831.inside-cover.jpg|thumb|right|The structural differences between multiple editions of ''[[Frankenstein]]'' have been analysed with overlapping techniques.{{sfn|Piez|2014}}]]\n\nThe problem of non-hierarchical structures in documents has been recognised since 1988; resolving it against the dominant paradigm of text as a single hierarchy (an ''ordered hierarchy of content objects'' or ''OHCO'') was initially thought to be merely a technical issue, but has, in fact, proven much more difficult.{{sfn|Renear|Mylonas|Durand|1993}}\nIn 2008, [[Jeni Tennison]] identified markup overlap as \"the main remaining problem area for markup technologists\".{{sfn|Tennison|2008}}\nMarkup overlap continues to be a primary issue in the digital study of theological texts in 2019, and is a major reason for the field retaining specialised markup formats&mdash;the [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] and the [[Theological Markup Language]]&mdash;rather than the inter-operable [[Text Encoding Initiative]]-based formats common to the rest of the [[digital humanities]].{{sfn|MoChridhe|2019}}\n\n== Properties and types ==\n\nA distinction exists between schemes that allow non-contiguous overlap, and those that allow only contiguous overlap. Often, 'markup overlap' strictly means the latter.\nContiguous overlap can always be represented as a linear document with milestones (typically co-indexed start- and end-markers), without the need for fragmenting a (logical) component into multiple physical ones. Non-contiguous overlap may require document fragmentation. Another distinction in overlapping markup schemes is whether elements can overlap with other elements of the same kind (''self-overlap'').{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=The problem types}}\n\nA scheme may have a ''privileged'' hierarchy.\nSome [[XML]]-based schemes, for example, represent one hierarchy directly in the XML document tree, and represent other, overlapping, structures by another means;\nthese are said to be ''non-privileged''.\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012}} identifies a tripartite classification of instances of overlap: 1. \"Variation of content and structure\", 2. \"Overlay of multiple  perspectives or markup sets\", and 3. \"Overlap of individual start and end tags within a single markup perspective\";\nadditionally, some apparent instances of overlap are in fact schema definition problems, which can be resolved hierarchically.\nHe contends that type 1 is best resolved by a system of multiple documents external to the markup, but types 2 and 3 require dealing with internally.\n\n== Approaches and implementations ==\n\n{{harvtxt|DeRose|2004|loc=Evaluation criteria}} identifies several criteria for judging solutions to the overlap problem: \n* readability and maintainability, \n* tool support and compatibility with XML, \n* possible validation schemes, and \n* ease of processing.\n\n[[Tag soup]] is, strictly speaking, not overlapping markup\u2014it is malformed [[HTML]], which is a non-overlapping language, and may be ill-defined.\nSome [[web browsers]] attempted to represent overlapping start and end tags with non-hierarchical [[Document Object Model]]s (DOM), but this was not standardised across all browsers and was incompatible with the innately hierarchical nature of the DOM.{{sfn|Hickson|2002}}{{sfn|Sivonen|2003}}\n[[HTML5]] defines how processors should deal with such mis-nested markup in the HTML syntax and turn it into a single hierarchy.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#an-introduction-to-error-handling-and-strange-cases-in-the-parser \u00a7 8.2.8 An introduction to error handling and strange cases in the parser]}}\nWith [[XHTML]] and [[SGML]]-based HTML, however, mis-nested markup is a strict error and makes processing by standards-compliant systems impossible.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.1. Non-SGML Notations}}\nThe HTML standard defines a [[paragraph]] concept which can cause overlap with other elements and can be non-contiguous.{{sfn|HTML|loc = [https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/dom.html#paragraphs \u00a7 3.2.5.4 Paragraphs]}}\n\n[[SGML]], which early versions of HTML were based on, has a feature called CONCUR that allows multiple independent hierarchies to co-exist without privileging any.\n[[Document type definition|DTD]] validation is only defined for each individual hierarchy with CONCUR. Validation across hierarchies is not defined by the standard. CONCUR cannot support self-overlap, and it interacts poorly with some of SGML's abbreviatory features.\nThis feature has been poorly supported by tools and has seen very little actual use;\nusing CONCUR to represent document overlap was not a recommended use case, according to a commentary by the standard's editor.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.2. CONCUR}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=SGML CONCUR}}\n\n=== Within hierarchical languages ===\n\nThere are several approaches to representing overlap in a non-overlapping language.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\nThe [[Text Encoding Initiative]], as an XML-based markup scheme, cannot directly represent overlapping markup.\nAll four of the below approaches are suggested.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc = [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html \u00a7 20 Non-hierarchical Structures]}}\nThe [[Open Scripture Information Standard]] is another XML-based scheme, designed to mark up the [[Bible]].\nIt uses empty milestone elements to encode non-privileged components.{{sfn|Durusau|2006}}\n\nTo illustrate these approaches, marking up the sentences and lines of a fragment of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] will be used as a running example. Where there is a privileged hierarchy, the lines will be used.\n\n==== Multiple documents ====\n''Multiple documents'' can each provide different internally consistent hierarchies. The advantage of this approach is that each document is simple and can be processed with existing tools, but requires maintenance of redundant content and it can be difficult to cross-reference between different views.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHME \u00a7 20.1 Multiple Encodings of the Same Information]}} With multiple documents, the overlap can be analysed with [[data comparison]] and [[delta encoding]] techniques, and, in an XML context, specific XML tree differencing algorithms are available.{{sfn|Schmidt|2009}}{{sfn|La Fontaine|2016}}\n\n{{harvtxt|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.5 Variation}} recommends this approach for encoding multiple variants of a single text and to accept the duplication of the parts which do not vary, rather than attempting to create a structure that represents all of the variation present;\nfurther, he suggests that this alignment be performed automatically, and that misalignment is rare in practice.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.1 Automating Variation}}\n\nExample, with lines marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</line>\n  <line>So much for that.\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</line>\n</source>\n\nWith sentences marked up:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <sentence>I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,\n  Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence>\n  <sentence>So much for that.</sentence><sentence>\u2014The silent hours steal on,\n  And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence>\n</source>\n\n==== Milestones ====\n''Milestones'' are empty elements that mark the beginning and end of a component. These can be used to embed a non-privileged structure within a hierarchical language, and can only represent contiguous overlap. Existing tools will also not understand the meaning of the milestone elements and so cannot easily process or validate the non-privileged structure.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHBM \u00a7 20.2 Boundary Marking with Empty Elements]}}{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.4. Milestones}} The markup being near the content is an advantage for maintainability and readability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=TEI-style milestones}} [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]] {{harv|DeRose|2004}} is an example of such an approach.\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence-start />I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</line>\n  <line>Who prays continually for Richmond's good.<sentence-end /></line>\n  <line><sentence-start />So much for that.<sentence-end /><sentence-start />\u2014The silent hours steal on,</line>\n  <line>And flaky darkness breaks within the east.<sentence-end /></line>\n</source>\n\n[[Punctuation]] and [[Space (punctuation)|spaces]] have been identified as a type of milestone-style 'crypto-overlap' or 'pseudo-markup', as the boundaries of words, clauses, sentences and the like do not necessarily align with the formal markup boundaries hierarchically.{{sfn|Birnbaum|Thorsen|2015}}{{sfn|Haentjens Dekker|Birnbaum|2017}}\n\n==== Joins ====\n''Joins'' are pointers within a privileged hierarchy to other components of the privileged hierarchy, which may be used to reconstruct a non-privileged component akin to following a [[linked list]]. A single non-privileged element is ''segmented'' into several ''partial'' elements within the privileged hierarchy; the partial elements themselves do not represent a single unit in the non-privileged hierarchy, which can be misleading and make processing difficult.{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc=[https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHVE \u00a7 20.3 Fragmentation and Reconstitution of Virtual Elements]}}{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Segmentation}} While this approach can support some discontiguous structures, it is not able to re-order elements.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.5. Fragmentation}} A slightly different approach can, however, express re-ordering by expressing the join away from the content, at the cost of directness and maintainability.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=Joins}}\n\nJoin-based representations can introduce the possibility of cycles between elements; detecting and rejecting these adds complexity to implementations.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=3.4 Interlinking}}\n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <line><sentence id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"a\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence id=\"b\">So much for that.</sentence><sentence id=\"c\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</sentence></line>\n  <line><sentence continues=\"c\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</sentence></line>\n</source>\n\n==== Stand-off markup ====\n''Stand-off markup'' is similar to using joins, except that there is no privileged hierarchy: each part of the document is given a label (or might be referred to by an offset), and the document is constructed by pointing to the content from markup that 'stands off' from the content (possibly in an entirely different file), and might contain no content itself. The TEI guidelines identify the unity of the elements as a primary advantage of stand-off markup over joins, in addition to the ability to produce and distribute the annotations separately from the text, possibly even by different authors applying markup to a read-only document,{{sfn|Text Encoding Initiative|loc= [https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/NH.html#NHSO \u00a7 20.4 Stand-off Markup]}} allowing collaborative approaches to markup by a [[wikt:divide and conquer|divide and conquer]] strategy.{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|loc=4.2 Markup Outside the Text}}\n\nIt has been claimed that separating markup and text can result in overall simplification and increased maintainability,{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019|loc=Conclusion}} and by 2017, ``[t]he current state of the art to (...) linguistically annotated data [was] to use a graph-based representation serialized as standoff XML as a pivot format\u00b4\u00b4<ref name=\"habla-99\">{{cite journal |last1=Ide |first1=Nancy |last2=Chiarcos |first2=Christian |last3=Stede |first3=Manfred |last4=Cassidy |first4=Steve |title=Designing Annotation Schemes: From Model to Representation |journal=Nancy Ide & James Pustejowsky (eds.), Handbook of Linguistic Annotation |date=2017 |page=99 |pages=|url=https://www.springer.com/de/book/9789402408799 |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht}}</ref> \n\nExample:\n<source lang=xml>\n  <span id=\"a\">I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother,</span>\n  <span id=\"b\">Who prays continually for Richmond's good.</span>\n  <span id=\"c\">So much for that.</span><span id=\"d\">\u2014The silent hours steal on,</span>\n  <span id=\"e\">And flaky darkness breaks within the east.</span>\n  ...\n  <line contents=\"a\" />\n  <line contents=\"b\" />\n  <line contents=\"c d\" />\n  <line contents=\"e\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"a b\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"c\" />\n  <sentence contents=\"d e\" />\n</source>\n\nStandoff formalisms have been the basis for an ISO standard for linguistic annotation <ref>https://www.iso.org/standard/37326.html</ref>, they have been successfully applied for developing corpus management systems,<ref name=\"habla-p99\">{{cite journal |last1=Chiarcos |first1=Christian |last2=Dipper |first2=Stefanie |last3=G\u00f6tze |first3=Michael |last4=Leser |first4=Ulf |last5=L\u00fcdeling |first5=Anke |last6=Ritz |first6=Julia |last7=Stede |first7=Manfred |title=A flexible framework for integrating annotations from different tools and tagsets |journal=Traitement Automatique des Languages |date=2008 |volume=49 |issue=2 |page=271-293 |url=https://www.atala.org/content/flexible-framework-integrating-annotations-different-tools-and-tag-sets}}</ref> and (as of April 2020) they are actively being developed in the TEI.<ref>https://github.com/TEIC/TEI/issues/1745</ref> \n\nA disadvantage of standoff is that validation is very challenging.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.6. Standoff Markup}} \nStandoff formalisms are not natively supported by database management systems, so that (by 2017) it was suggested to ``use ... standoff XML as a pivot format (...) and relational data bases for querying.\u00b4\u00b4<ref name=\"habla-99\"/> In practical applications, this requires complicated architectures and/or labor-intense transformation between pivot format and internal representation. As a result, maintenance is problematic.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|log=Standoff markup}} This has been a motivation to develop corpus management systems on the basis of graph data bases and for using established graph-based formalisms as pivot formats.\n\n=== New languages ===\n\nAnother approach is to design an entirely new markup language.\nThese forego the tool support in existing languages for a less complicated semantic model and more convenient syntax.\n\n* [[LMNL]] is a non-hierarchical markup language first described in 2002 by [[Jeni Tennison]] and [[Wendell Piez]], annotating ranges of a document with properties and allowing self-overlap. [[CLIX (markup)|CLIX]], which originally stood for 'Canonical LMNL In XML', provides a method for representing any LMNL document in a milestone-style XML document.{{sfn|DeRose|2004|loc=CLIX and LMNL}} It also has another XML serialisation, xLMNL.{{sfn|Piez|2012}}\n* [[MECS]] was developed by the [[University of Bergen]]'s [[Wittgenstein Archive]]. However, it had several problems: it allowed some non-sensical documents of overlapping elements, it could not support self-overlap, and it did not have the capacity to define a DTD-like grammar.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000|loc=2.7. MECS}} The theory of [[General Ordered-Descendant Directed Acyclic Graph]]s (GODDAGs), while not strictly a markup language itself, is a general data model for non-hierarchical markup. ''Restricted GODDAGs'' were designed specifically to match the semantics of MECS; general GODDAGs may be non-contiguous and need a more powerful language.{{sfn|Sperberg-McQueen|Huitfeldt|2000}} [[TexMECS]] is a successor to MECS, which has a formal grammar and is designed to represent every GODDAG and nothing that is not a GODDAG.{{sfn|Huitfeldt|Sperberg-McQueen|2003}}\n* [[XCONCUR]] (previously MuLaX) is a melding-together of XML and SGML's CONCUR, and also contains a validation language, XCONCUR-CL, and a [[Simple API for XML|SAX]]-like API.{{sfn|Hilbert|Schonefeld|Witt|2005}}{{sfn|Witt|Schonefeld|Rehm|Khoo|2007}}{{sfn|Schonefeld|2008}}\n* Marinelli, Vitali and Zacchiroli provide algorithms to convert between restricted GODDAGs, ECLIX, LMNL, parallel documents in XML, contiguous stand-off markup and TexMECS.{{sfn|Marinelli|Vitali|Zacchiroli|2008}}\n\n=== Graph-based formalisms ===\n\nRather than grounding markup information in a tree, standoff XML employs a data model based on directed graphs.{{sfn|Ide|Suderman|2007}}\nAs an alternative to traditional markup, such graph-based data models can be represented with formalisms originally developed for generalised directed [[multigraph]]s, most notably the [[Resource Description Framework|Resource Description Framework (RDF)]].{{sfn|Cassidy|2010|log=cassidy}}{{sfn|Chiarcos|2012|log=POWLA}}\nEARMARK is an early [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] representation that encompasses GODDAGs.{{sfn|Di Iorio|Peroni|Vitali|2009}}\n\nRDF provides different linearisations, including an XML format that can be modeled to mirror conventional standoff XML, and a linearization that lets RDF be expressed in XML attributes ([[RDFa]]). But while it is semantically equivalent to standoff XML, it does not require special-purpose technology for storing, parsing and querying. Multiple interlinked RDF files representing a document or a corpus may constitute an example of [[Linguistic Linked Open Data]].\n\nEggert & Schmidt describe encoding a corpus (the [[Charles Harpur Critical Archive]]) using 'multi-version documents' (MVD) to represent the variant versions of documents and as a means of indicating additions, deletions and revisions using a tactical combination of multiple documents and stand-off ranges within an underlying graph-based model. MVD is presented as an application file format, requiring specialised tools to view or edit.{{sfn|Eggert|Schmidt|2019}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{ cite conference\n

{"title_page": "Capital punishment in the Philippines", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2019}}\n'''Capital punishment in the [[Republic of the Philippines|Philippines]]''' has a varied history and is currently suspended as of 2006.  Capital punishment was legal after independence and increased in use under the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] regime.  After the fall of Marcos, there was a moratorium on capital punishment from 1987 to 1999, followed by a resumption in executions from 1999 to 2006, and followed - in turn - by a law ending the practice.\n\nFilipinos have mixed opinions about the [[death penalty]], with many opposing it on religious and humanitarian grounds, while advocates see it as a way of deterring crimes. Although the Philippines officially does not have capital punishment, extrajudicial killings are very common.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/world/asia/philippines-duterte-killings-un.html</ref>\n\n==Spanish and American periods==\n[[Image:Garrote Execution - 1901.png|thumb|A 1901 execution at the Old [[Bilibid Prison]], [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]]]\nDuring [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Spanish colonization of the Philippines|colonial rule]], the most common methods of execution were death by [[firing squad]] (especially for treason/military crimes, usually reserved for independence fighters) and [[garrotte]] (a notable case would be the [[Gomburza]]). [[Death by hanging]] was another popular method.\n\nA prominent example is the [[National hero of the Philippines|national hero]], [[Jos\u00e9 Rizal]], who was executed by firing squad on the morning of December 30, 1896, in the [[Rizal Park|park that now bears his name]].<ref>{{cite news |last=McLean |first=John |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/3337273.stm |title=Philippines 'restores' death penalty |work=BBC News |date=December 21, 2003 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1926, the [[electric chair]] ([[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]]: ''silla el\u00e9ctrica''; [[Filipino language|Filipino]]: ''silya el\u00e9ktrika'') was introduced by the [[United States]]' colonial [[Insular Government]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Galvin|first=Anthony|title=Old Sparky: The Electric Chair and the History of the Death Penalty|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZduLDAAAQBAJ|year=2016|publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Company, Incorporated|isbn=978-1-5107-1135-8|page=[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=ZduLDAAAQBAJ&pg=PT158&dq=%22in+1926,+the+US+authorities+introduced+the+electric+chair%22 15]}}</ref> making the Philippines the only other country to employ this method.

The new law (Republic Act 7659), drafted by Ramos, was passed in 1993, restoring capital punishment. This law provided the use of the electric chair until the [[gas chamber]] (chosen by the government to replace electrocution) could be used. In 1996, Republic Act 8177 was passed, prescribing the use of lethal injection as the method of carrying out capital punishment.\n\nExecutions resumed in 1999, starting with [[Leo Echegaray]], who was put to death by [[lethal injection]] under Ramos' successor, [[Joseph Estrada]], marking the first execution after the reinstatement of the death penalty. The next execution saw an embarrassing mishap when President Estrada decided to grant a last-minute reprieve, but failed to get through to the prison authorities in time to stop the execution. Following on a personal appeal by his spiritual advisor, Bishop Teodoro Bacani, Estrada called for a moratorium in 2000 to honor the [[Great Jubilee|bimillenial anniversary of Christ's birth]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act53/001/2000/en/ |title=Download Documents &#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2014 }}</ref> Executions were resumed a year later.\n\nEstrada's successor, [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]], was a vocal opponent of the death penalty and also approved a moratorium on the carrying out of capital punishment.

Because he was so fond of this extensive ceramics collection \u2014 which reached more than 5 thousands pieces in quantity \u2014 he refused to divide them up, so he left all the collection intact in the National Museum's custody. It is important to note that this collection that dated back from [[Han dynasty|Han]] (2nd century BC) to the time of [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (18th century) is the largest ceramic collection in Southeast Asia.<ref name=\"Potret-MNI\"/>{{rp|15}}\n\nAfter the year 2000, the ceramics collection increased significantly from the addition of ceramics objects retrieved from several sunken ships in Indonesian waters.

This temporary exhibition usually held for several weeks to a month, with specific focus of interest. For example, the specific exhibitions of \nIndonesian ancient empires; the [[Majapahit]] Exhibition in 2007<ref name=\"Tempo-Gedung Arca\"/>  and the [[Srivijaya]] Exhibition in 2017.<ref name= \"JP-Srivijaya\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/life/2017/11/04/sriwijaya-role-model-for-indonesian-development.html|title=Sriwijaya role model for Indonesian development|last=Partogi |first=Sebastian|work=The Jakarta Post|access-date=2017-11-29|language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe Majapahit Exhibition in 2007 was meant to revisit the archaeological aspect, cultural and historic legacy of Majapahit as the center of a great civilization in the archipelago.
