He was the first European to name [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]], calling it ''Lac du Saint Sacrement'' (Lake of the Blessed Sacrament). In 1646, Jogues was martyred by the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] at their village of [[Ossernenon]], north of the [[Mohawk River]].\n\nJogues, [[Jean de Br\u00e9beuf]] and [[Canadian Martyrs|six other martyred missionaries]], all Jesuit priests or laymen associated with them, were canonized by the [[Catholic Church]] in 1930<ref>[https://canadianmartyrs.org/resources/canadian-martyrs/ Lives of the Canadian martyrs]</ref>; they are known as \"The [[North American Martyrs]]\".

In 1624, at the age of seventeen, he entered the Jesuit [[novitiate]] at [[Rouen]] in Northern France. Here, his [[Master of novices|Master of Novices]] was [[Louis Lallemant]]. The Jesuit community had a strong missionary spirit, beginning in 1625 with their first mission to New France, including missionary pioneers, [[\u00c9nemond Mass\u00e9]], and later, [[Jean de Br\u00e9beuf]]. Lallement had two brothers and a nephew serving as missionaries in the colony of [[New France]].

Crawley & Co., Inc.]</ref>\n\nJogues professed simple vows in 1626, and went to study philosophy at the royal college of [[La Fl\u00e8che]]. In 1629, he taught humanities to boys in Rouen. In 1633, Jogues was sent to the [[Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand|Coll\u00e8ge de Clermont]] in [[Paris]] to pursue his studies in [[Theology]]. In 1636, he was ordained a priest at Clermont.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|title = Isaac Jogues 1607-1646|url = http://www.wyandot.org/jogues.htm|website = www.wyandot.org|access-date = 21 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Early missions ==\nIn 1636 missionary fathers Brebeuf, [[Charles Lallemant]] and Mass\u00e9 returned from New France. They told Jogues of the hardships, treacheries and tortures which ordinarily awaited missionaries in New France. Their accounts however, increased Jogues' desire to \"devote himself to labor there for the conversion and welfare of the natives\".<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title = Isaac Jogues: Missioner and Martyr|last = Scott|first = Martin|publisher = |year = 1928|isbn = |location = New York|page = 45}}</ref> Soon after Jogues was ordained, he accepted service in the missions and embarked to New France with several other missionaries, among them Charles Garnier. Jogues was assigned as a missionary to the Huron and Algonquian peoples; both were allies of the French in Quebec.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nJogues sailed from France on 8 April 1636, and eight weeks later his ship dropped anchor in the [[Chaleur Bay|Baie des Chaleurs]]. Jogues arrived in Quebec only several weeks later on 2 July. On arrival, Jogues wrote to his mother: \"I do not know it is to enter Heaven, but this I know-- that it would be difficult to experience in this world a joy more excessive and more overflowing than I felt in setting foot in the New World, and celebrating my first Mass on the day of Visitation\".{{sfn|Scott, p.52}}\n\nJogues joined Jean de Br\u00e9beuf, the Superior of the Jesuit Mission, at their settlement on Lake Huron, the village of St. Joseph (Ihonatiria), on 11 September. Upon his arrival, Jogues was stricken by fever. Soon thereafter, a similar epidemic broke out among other Jesuits and the native people of the village. Due to recurring epidemics, the Huron blamed the Black Coats, as they called the Jesuits, threatening to kill them all.{{sfn|Scott, p.61}} Father Brebeuf conciliated them and by the following year relations had improved as evidenced by one of his reports: \"We are gladly heard, and there is scarcely a village that has not invited us to go to it... And at last it is understood from our whole conduct that we have not come to buy skins or to carry on any traffic, but solely to teach them, and to procure them their souls' health.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFor six years Jogues lived in the village of St. Joseph and learned the ways and language of the Hurons. The missionaries \"accommodated themselves to the customs and food of the savages\" as much as possible to show the Indians that they intended to share their life. Gradually, the native people began to accept Jogues. This did not last long however, as there were some Indians who had been \"among the English and Dutch settlers to the south\" who spread reports that the missionaries brought \"calamity wherever they went and that they had in consequence been driven out of Europe\".{{sfn|Scott, p.64}}\n\nJogues traveled with Garnier to the Petun, a first nations band located in modern-day southern Ontario, who were also known as the Tobacco Nation for their chief commodity crop. The natives of the village were so uninviting to the missionaries that the Fathers thought it would be impossible to do any missionary work among them. The rumours that had encircled them spread to the village and quickly discovered that their cause was just as hopeless as in the former place.{{sfn|Scott, p.52}} They travelled from village to village, until after a couple of months they decided that they could not continue to do their missionary work. Their luck changed however, when in 1639, the new superior of the Jesuit Mission, Father [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalemant]], entrusted the building of Fort Sainte-Marie to Jogues.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn September 1641, Jogues and Charles Raymbaut went into the territory of the Sauteurs (Oijbwe). They were welcomed by some two thousand Indians upon their arrival. Jogues settled down to the duties of a resident missioner at St. Mary's for some time.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Capture by the Iroquois  ==\n[[Image:Mosaic in the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Mosaic of St. Isaac Jogues in the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis]]]]\nOn 3 August 1642, Jogues, [[Guillaume Couture]], [[Ren\u00e9 Goupil]], and a group of Christian Hurons were heading back from Quebec City when they were waylaid by a war party of the [[Mohawk Nation]], part of the Iroquois Confederacy. Jogues allegedly hid in reeds and bushes, but decided to leave his hiding place to join the prisoners so that he could comfort them and ensure that their faith in Christianity remained strong. Shortly thereafter, and in retaliation for comforting a tortured Frenchman, the Mohawk beat Jogues with sticks, tore out his fingernails, then gnawed the ends of his fingers until finger bones were visible.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|title = The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents Volume 31|url = http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_31.html|website = puffin.creighton.edu|access-date = 21 February 2016|date = 11 August 2014}}</ref> The war party then took their captives on a journey to a Mohawk village. There, the villagers marched them through a gauntlet, which consisted of rows of Iroquois armed with rods and sticks beating the prisoners walking in single-file. Afterwards, the Iroquois forced Jogues and the prisoners onto an elevated platform where they were mocked. A captive Algonquin woman then cut off Jogues' thumb. At night, the prisoners were tied spread-eagled in a cabin. Children threw burning coals onto their bodies. Three days later, Jogues and the prisoners were marched from one village to another, where the Iroquois flogged them in gauntlets, and jabbed sticks into their wounds and sores. At the third village, Jogues was hung from a wooden plank and nearly lost consciousness, until an Iroquois had pity on him and cut him free. Throughout his captivity, Jogues comforted, baptized, heard confession from, and absolved the other prisoners.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nHearing of their capture, [[Arent van Curler]], ''commis'' of [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaerswyck]], visited the \"first castle\" and attempted to ransom them, but without success as the Mohawk were not inclined to release them at that time. Van Curler was able to elicit a promise not to kill the captives. Instead of being put to death or integrated into a Mohawk family, Jogues remained a captive at large. Perpetually malnourished and inadequately dressed for the harsh winters, he spent his days gathering wood, praying, and proselytizing his captors.{{sfn|Scott, p.52}} Seeking solace in his faith, Jogues prayed so intensely that he had visions: in one, he suddenly appeared in a bookstore covered in crosses, and bought a book that reminded him that, to enter into Heaven, it was necessary to experience many tribulations.<ref name=\":2\" /> His captivity dragged on, lasting about a year, during which he experienced severe malnourishment and exposure to the cold. Some noteworthy incidents that occurred during this period were when he saved the life of a pregnant woman that had fallen into a deep, fast-flowing creek during the winter, and when he baptized the Iroquois man who had freed him from the wooden torture device.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Isaac Jogues NYC.jpg|thumb|right|250px|On a door to [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in New York City]]\n\nIn the autumn of 1643, the Mohawk were persuaded to bring the priest with them when they came to [[Beverwijck]] to trade. Once there, Van Curler helped Jogues to escape, hiding him his barn until a deal could be reached and the Frenchman put on a ship to take him downriver.<ref>[http://www.troyrecord.com/article/TR/20110706/NEWS/307069976 Denner, Diana. \"New interpretive sign to adorn Schuyler Flatts Park\", ''Troy Record'', July 6, 2011]</ref> Reformed minister [[Johannes Megapolensis]] accompanied him to [[New Amsterdam]], where Jogues stayed with the minister while waiting for a ship to take him France. Jogues was the first Catholic priest to visit Manhattan Island.<ref name=crawley/> From there, he sailed back to France.\n\n== Return to France ==\n[[Pope Urban VIII]] considered Jogues a \"living martyr,\" and gave him dispensation to say Mass with his mutilated hand. Under Church law of the time, the Blessed Sacrament could not be touched with any fingers but the thumb and forefinger. Jogues was unable to follow this law after the loss of two fingers while in Iroquois captivity, resulting in the requirement for dispensation by the Pope. Jogues visited his mother in [[Orl\u00e9ans]], but was eager to return to the missions. Jogues experienced regret over his time in captivity, and a longing for martyrdom that motivated his return to New France in 1644 after only a year and a half in France, first to Quebec, followed by a trip to Wendake.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Return to New France and death ==\nIn the spring of 1646, Jogues returned to Iroquois territory, along with [[Jean de Lalande]], to act as the French ambassador to the Mohawk. His ambassadorship was intended to maintain the tentative peace reached in 1645 between the Iroquois, and the French, the Huron and the Algonquin. This was done to ensure a safe passage for trade and travel.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nJogues and Lalande were met with hesitation upon their arrival, as some Mohawk regarded missionaries as evil practitioners of foreign magic. The Europeans transmitted European diseases, such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], that spread among Native Americans. These diseases resulted in high fatality rates among the Mohawk, who lacked immunity to the new diseases. When the Mohawk suffered yet another outbreak of infectious disease, and crop failure at [[Ossernenon]], they blamed these unfortunate events on Catholic paraphernalia left behind by the Jesuits, which the Mohawks perceived as magically harmful. Additionally, as a result of his previous experience on the territory, Jogues demonstrated an uncanny knowledge of the territory, which the Mohawks perceived as threatening.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = The Death and Afterlife of the North American Martyrs|last = Anderson|first = Emma|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|page = 25}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 October 1646, the Mohawks killed Jogues with a [[tomahawk]]; they killed LaLande the next day. They threw the missionaries' bodies into the [[Mohawk River]]. The killing seems to have been the work of an anti-French faction within the Mohawk community.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe story holds a curious double martyrdom of Jogues. Aboriginal allies of the French captured Jogues' killer in 1647 and condemned him to death.

He was the first European to name [[Lake George (New York)|Lake George]], calling it ''Lac du Saint Sacrement'' (Lake of the Blessed Sacrament). In 1646, Jogues was martyred by the [[Mohawk people|Mohawk]] at their village of [[Ossernenon]], north of the [[Mohawk River]].\n\nJogues, [[Jean de Br\u00e9beuf]] and [[Canadian Martyrs|six other martyred missionaries]], all Jesuit priests or laymen associated with them, were canonized by the Roman Catholic Church in 1930<ref>[https://canadianmartyrs.org/resources/canadian-martyrs/ Lives of the Canadian martyrs]</ref>; they are known as \"The [[North American Martyrs]]\". A shrine was built in their honor at [[Auriesville, New York]], at a site formerly believed to be that of the Mohawk village. Their feast day is celebrated on 19 October in the [[General Roman Calendar]], and on 26 September in Canada.\n\n==Early life and education==\nIsaac Jogues was born to Laurent Jogues and Fran\u00e7oise de Sainte-Mesmin on 10 January 1607. He was born in [[Orl\u00e9ans]], France, into a bourgeois family, where he was the fifth of nine children.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=O\u2019Neill |first1=Sean |title=Jogues, Isaac (1607-1646), Jesuit missionary and martyr {{!}} American National Biography |journal=www.anb.org |doi=10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.0101240 |url=https://www.anb.org/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.001.0001/anb-9780198606697-e-0101240 |language=en}}</ref><ref>[http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/jogues_isaac_1E.html Isaac Jogues] Dictionary of Canadian biography</ref> He was educated at home until the age of ten, at which point he began attending Jesuit schools. In 1624, at the age of seventeen, he entered the Jesuit [[novitiate]] at [[Rouen]] in Northern France. Here, his [[Master of novices|Master of Novices]] was [[Louis Lallemant]]. The Jesuit community had a strong missionary spirit, beginning in 1625 with their first mission to New France, including missionary pioneers, [[\u00c9nemond Mass\u00e9]], and later, [[Jean de Br\u00e9beuf]]. Lallement had two brothers and a nephew serving as missionaries in the colony of [[New France]]. These Jesuit missionaries inspired Jogues, and he aspired to follow in their footsteps.<ref name=crawley>[http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/JOGUES.htm \"St. Isaac Jogues - Martyr\", ''Lives of Saints'', John J. Crawley & Co., Inc.]</ref>\n\nJogues professed simple vows in 1626, and went to study philosophy at the royal college of [[La Fl\u00e8che]]. In 1629, he taught humanities to boys in Rouen. In 1633, Jogues was sent to the [[Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand|Coll\u00e8ge de Clermont]] in [[Paris]] to pursue his studies in [[Theology]]. In 1636, he was ordained a priest at Clermont.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|title = Isaac Jogues 1607-1646|url = http://www.wyandot.org/jogues.htm|website = www.wyandot.org|access-date = 21 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Early missions ==\nIn 1636 missionary fathers Brebeuf, [[Charles Lallemant]] and Mass\u00e9 returned from New France. They told Jogues of the hardships, treacheries and tortures which ordinarily awaited missionaries in New France. Their accounts however, increased Jogues' desire to \"devote himself to labor there for the conversion and welfare of the natives\".<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title = Isaac Jogues: Missioner and Martyr|last = Scott|first = Martin|publisher = |year = 1928|isbn = |location = New York|page = 45}}</ref> Soon after Jogues was ordained, he accepted service in the missions and embarked to New France with several other missionaries, among them Charles Garnier. Jogues was assigned as a missionary to the Huron and Algonquian peoples; both were allies of the French in Quebec.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nJogues sailed from France on 8 April 1636, and eight weeks later his ship dropped anchor in the [[Chaleur Bay|Baie des Chaleurs]]. Jogues arrived in Quebec only several weeks later on 2 July. On arrival, Jogues wrote to his mother: \"I do not know it is to enter Heaven, but this I know-- that it would be difficult to experience in this world a joy more excessive and more overflowing than I felt in setting foot in the New World, and celebrating my first Mass on the day of Visitation\".{{sfn|Scott, p.52}}\n\nJogues joined Jean de Br\u00e9beuf, the Superior of the Jesuit Mission, at their settlement on Lake Huron, the village of St. Joseph (Ihonatiria), on 11 September. Upon his arrival, Jogues was stricken by fever. Soon thereafter, a similar epidemic broke out among other Jesuits and the native people of the village. Due to recurring epidemics, the Huron blamed the Black Coats, as they called the Jesuits, threatening to kill them all.{{sfn|Scott, p.61}} Father Brebeuf conciliated them and by the following year relations had improved as evidenced by one of his reports: \"We are gladly heard, and there is scarcely a village that has not invited us to go to it... And at last it is understood from our whole conduct that we have not come to buy skins or to carry on any traffic, but solely to teach them, and to procure them their souls' health.\"<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nFor six years Jogues lived in the village of St. Joseph and learned the ways and language of the Hurons. The missionaries \"accommodated themselves to the customs and food of the savages\" as much as possible to show the Indians that they intended to share their life. Gradually, the native people began to accept Jogues. This did not last long however, as there were some Indians who had been \"among the English and Dutch settlers to the south\" who spread reports that the missionaries brought \"calamity wherever they went and that they had in consequence been driven out of Europe\".{{sfn|Scott, p.64}}\n\nJogues traveled with Garnier to the Petun, a first nations band located in modern-day southern Ontario, who were also known as the Tobacco Nation for their chief commodity crop. The natives of the village were so uninviting to the missionaries that the Fathers thought it would be impossible to do any missionary work among them. The rumours that had encircled them spread to the village and quickly discovered that their cause was just as hopeless as in the former place.{{sfn|Scott, p.52}} They travelled from village to village, until after a couple of months they decided that they could not continue to do their missionary work. Their luck changed however, when in 1639, the new superior of the Jesuit Mission, Father [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Lalemant]], entrusted the building of Fort Sainte-Marie to Jogues.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nIn September 1641, Jogues and Charles Raymbaut went into the territory of the Sauteurs (Oijbwe). They were welcomed by some two thousand Indians upon their arrival. Jogues settled down to the duties of a resident missioner at St. Mary's for some time.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n== Capture by the Iroquois  ==\n[[Image:Mosaic in the Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Mosaic of St. Isaac Jogues in the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis]]]]\nOn 3 August 1642, Jogues, [[Guillaume Couture]], [[Ren\u00e9 Goupil]], and a group of Christian Hurons were heading back from Quebec City when they were waylaid by a war party of the [[Mohawk Nation]], part of the Iroquois Confederacy. Jogues allegedly hid in reeds and bushes, but decided to leave his hiding place to join the prisoners so that he could comfort them and ensure that their faith in Christianity remained strong. Shortly thereafter, and in retaliation for comforting a tortured Frenchman, the Mohawk beat Jogues with sticks, tore out his fingernails, then gnawed the ends of his fingers until finger bones were visible.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|title = The Jesuit Relations and Allied Documents Volume 31|url = http://puffin.creighton.edu/jesuit/relations/relations_31.html|website = puffin.creighton.edu|access-date = 21 February 2016|date = 11 August 2014}}</ref> The war party then took their captives on a journey to a Mohawk village. There, the villagers marched them through a gauntlet, which consisted of rows of Iroquois armed with rods and sticks beating the prisoners walking in single-file. Afterwards, the Iroquois forced Jogues and the prisoners onto an elevated platform where they were mocked. A captive Algonquin woman then cut off Jogues' thumb. At night, the prisoners were tied spread-eagled in a cabin. Children threw burning coals onto their bodies. Three days later, Jogues and the prisoners were marched from one village to another, where the Iroquois flogged them in gauntlets, and jabbed sticks into their wounds and sores. At the third village, Jogues was hung from a wooden plank and nearly lost consciousness, until an Iroquois had pity on him and cut him free. Throughout his captivity, Jogues comforted, baptized, heard confession from, and absolved the other prisoners.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nHearing of their capture, [[Arent van Curler]], ''commis'' of [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaerswyck]], visited the \"first castle\" and attempted to ransom them, but without success as the Mohawk were not inclined to release them at that time. Van Curler was able to elicit a promise not to kill the captives. Instead of being put to death or integrated into a Mohawk family, Jogues remained a captive at large. Perpetually malnourished and inadequately dressed for the harsh winters, he spent his days gathering wood, praying, and proselytizing his captors.{{sfn|Scott, p.52}} Seeking solace in his faith, Jogues prayed so intensely that he had visions: in one, he suddenly appeared in a bookstore covered in crosses, and bought a book that reminded him that, to enter into Heaven, it was necessary to experience many tribulations.<ref name=\":2\" /> His captivity dragged on, lasting about a year, during which he experienced severe malnourishment and exposure to the cold. Some noteworthy incidents that occurred during this period were when he saved the life of a pregnant woman that had fallen into a deep, fast-flowing creek during the winter, and when he baptized the Iroquois man who had freed him from the wooden torture device.<ref name=\":2\" />\n[[File:Isaac Jogues NYC.jpg|thumb|right|250px|On a door to [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in New York City]]\n\nIn the autumn of 1643, the Mohawk were persuaded to bring the priest with them when they came to [[Beverwijck]] to trade. Once there, Van Curler helped Jogues to escape, hiding him his barn until a deal could be reached and the Frenchman put on a ship to take him downriver.<ref>[http://www.troyrecord.com/article/TR/20110706/NEWS/307069976 Denner, Diana. \"New interpretive sign to adorn Schuyler Flatts Park\", ''Troy Record'', July 6, 2011]</ref> Reformed minister [[Johannes Megapolensis]] accompanied him to [[New Amsterdam]], where Jogues stayed with the minister while waiting for a ship to take him France. Jogues was the first Catholic priest to visit Manhattan Island.<ref name=crawley/> From there, he sailed back to France.\n\n== Return to France ==\n[[Pope Urban VIII]] considered Jogues a \"living martyr,\" and gave him dispensation to say Mass with his mutilated hand. Under Church law of the time, the Blessed Sacrament could not be touched with any fingers but the thumb and forefinger. Jogues was unable to follow this law after the loss of two fingers while in Iroquois captivity, resulting in the requirement for dispensation by the Pope. Jogues visited his mother in [[Orl\u00e9ans]], but was eager to return to the missions. Jogues experienced regret over his time in captivity, and a longing for martyrdom that motivated his return to New France in 1644 after only a year and a half in France, first to Quebec, followed by a trip to Wendake.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Return to New France and death ==\nIn the spring of 1646, Jogues returned to Iroquois territory, along with [[Jean de Lalande]], to act as the French ambassador to the Mohawk. His ambassadorship was intended to maintain the tentative peace reached in 1645 between the Iroquois, and the French, the Huron and the Algonquin. This was done to ensure a safe passage for trade and travel.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nJogues and Lalande were met with hesitation upon their arrival, as some Mohawk regarded missionaries as evil practitioners of foreign magic. The Europeans transmitted European diseases, such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], that spread among Native Americans. These diseases resulted in high fatality rates among the Mohawk, who lacked immunity to the new diseases. When the Mohawk suffered yet another outbreak of infectious disease, and crop failure at [[Ossernenon]], they blamed these unfortunate events on Catholic paraphernalia left behind by the Jesuits, which the Mohawks perceived as magically harmful. Additionally, as a result of his previous experience on the territory, Jogues demonstrated an uncanny knowledge of the territory, which the Mohawks perceived as threatening.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title = The Death and Afterlife of the North American Martyrs|last = Anderson|first = Emma|publisher = Harvard University Press|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|page = 25}}</ref>\n\nOn 18 October 1646, the Mohawks killed Jogues with a [[tomahawk]]; they killed LaLande the next day. They threw the missionaries' bodies into the [[Mohawk River]]. The killing seems to have been the work of an anti-French faction within the Mohawk community.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe story holds a curious double martyrdom of Jogues. Aboriginal allies of the French captured Jogues' killer in 1647 and condemned him to death.

The then-President of Bangladesh Major General Ziaur Rahman created a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board]] under an army general to address the socio-economic needs of the region, but the entity proved unpopular and became a source of antagonism and mistrust among the local tribes against the government. The government failed to address the long-standing issue of the displacement of tribal people, numbering an estimated 100,000 caused by the construction of the [[Kaptai Dam]] by the then Pakistan government in 1962. Displaced tribesmen did not receive compensation and more than 40,000 Chakma tribals had fled to India. In the 1980s, the government began settling Bengalis in the region, causing the eviction of many tribesmen and a significant alteration of demographics. Having constituted only 11.6% of the regional population in 1974, the number of Bangalis grew by 1991 to constitute 48.5% of the regional population.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://unpo.org/article/19900|title=UNPO: Chittagong Hill Tracts: Local Human Rights Group Releases Report on Worrying Situation in Bangladesh|website=unpo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208231404/http://unpo.org/article/19900|archive-date=8 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/cht-struggle-for-peace-1013|title=CHT- Struggle for peace|date=2013-12-02|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171208174938/http://www.thedailystar.net/cht-struggle-for-peace-1013|archive-date=8 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nPeace negotiations were initiated after the restoration of democracy in Bangladesh in 1991, but little progress was made with the government of [[Prime Minister of Bangladesh|Prime Minister]] [[Begum Khaleda Zia]] and her [[Bangladesh Nationalist Party]].<ref name=\"CV3\">{{cite book |last=Majumder |first=Shantanu |year=2012 |chapter=Parbatya Chattagram Jana-Samhati Samiti |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Parbatya_Chattagram_Jana-Samhati_Samiti |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}</ref> Fresh rounds of talks began in 1996 with the newly elected prime minister [[Sheikh Hasina Wajed]] of the [[Awami League]].<ref name=\"CV3\"/> The [[Chattogram Hill Tracts Peace Accord]] was finalised and formally signed on 2 December 1997.<ref>[http://www.mochta.gov.bd/faq.php Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708205108/http://www.mochta.gov.bd/faq.php |date=8 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n=== Subsequent growth ===\n[[File:US Navy 071126-N-1831S-104 A member of the Bangladesh Army helps unload bags of purified water from a CH-46 Sea Knight assigned to the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge (LHD 3).jpg|thumb|Humanitarian operation after Cyclone Sidr 2.]]\nFollowing the 1975 coup, additional personnel were absorbed into the regular army when the martial law government abolished the [[Jatiyo Rakkhi Bahini]].

These force was organised in company groups attached to various regiments of Indian Army in direct support role.

As a result, in March 1971, Bengali soldiers in East Pakistan revolted and the Bangladesh Liberation War started. There was a Bangladesh Army Sector Commanders Conference during 11\u201317 July 1971. The conference was held three months after the oath of the newly formed Bangladesh Government at [[Meherpur District|Meherpur]], Kushtia. During this conference the structure and formation as well as resolving issues surrounding the organisation of the various sectors, strategy and reinforcements of the Bangladeshi forces was determined. It was of considerable historical importance from a tactical point of view, as it determined the command structure of the Bangladeshi forces throughout [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThis conference was presided over by the Bangladesh interim government in exile, headed by then Prime Minister [[Tajuddin Ahmed]] and Colonel (Retd.) [[M. A. G. Osmani]] was made the chairman of the ''Joint Chiefs of Staff'' of the Bangladesh Armed Forces. M. A. G. Osmani was reinstated into active duty from his retirement. Principal participants of this conference included: Squadron Leader [[M. Hamidullah Khan]], Major [[Ziaur Rahman]], Major [[Mohammad Abdul Jalil|Abdul Jalil]], Captain [[ATM Haider]], Lt. Col. [[MA Rab]] and Major [[Khaled Mosharraf]].\nAs a result of this meeting, Bangladesh was divided into [[List of sectors in Bangladesh Liberation War|eleven sectors]].<ref name=\":0\" /> These sectors were placed under the control of Sector Commanders, who would direct the guerilla war against [[Pakistan Armed Forces|Pakistani occupation forces]]. For better efficiency in military operations each of the sectors were also divided into a number of sub-sectors. As a point of note, the 10th Sector was under direct command of the Commander-in-Chief and included the Naval Commando Unit as a C-in-C's special force.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFollowing the conference a period of prolonged guerrilla warfare was launched by [[Bangladesh Forces]], which continued for a number of months. A further restructuring was undertaken and the Bangladesh Forces were organised into three brigade size combat groups:<ref name=\":0\" />\n* ''K Force'', under Major [[Khaled Mosharraf]], was created with 4th, 9th and 10th [[East Bengal Regiment]].\n* ''S Force'', under Major [[K M Shafiullah]], was created with 2nd and 11th [[East Bengal Regiment]].\n* ''Z Force'', under Major [[Ziaur Rahman]], was created with 1st, 3rd and 8th [[East Bengal Regiment]].\n\n=== Post 1971: The emergence of the Bangladesh Army ===\nDuring the sensitive and formative years after the end of the war, personnel of the [[Mukti Bahini]] were absorbed into different branches of Bangladesh Army.

The then-President of Bangladesh Major General Ziaur Rahman created a [[Chittagong Hill Tracts Development Board]] under an army general to address the socio-economic needs of the region, but the entity proved unpopular and became a source of antagonism and mistrust among the local tribes against the government. The government failed to address the long-standing issue of the displacement of tribal people, numbering an estimated 100,000 caused by the construction of the [[Kaptai Dam]] by the then Pakistan government in 1962. Displaced tribesmen did not receive compensation and more than 40,000 Chakma tribals had fled to India. In the 1980s, the government began settling Bengalis in the region, causing the eviction of many tribesmen and a significant alteration of demographics.

It is the eighth piece in the composer's [[Pr\u00e9ludes (Debussy)|first book of ''Pr\u00e9ludes'']], written between late 1909 and early 1910.  The title is in [[French language|French]] and translates roughly to \"The Girl with the [[Flax (color)|Flax]]en Hair\". The piece is 39 [[Bar (music)|measures]] long and takes approximately two and a half minutes to play.  It is in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[G-flat major|G{{music|b}} major]].\n\nThe piece, named after the eponymous poem by [[Leconte de Lisle]], is known for its musical simplicity, a divergence from Debussy's style at the time.  Completed in January 1910, it was published three months later and premiered in June of that same year.  The prelude is one of Debussy's most recorded pieces, both in its original version and in subsequent various arrangements.\n\n==Background and influence==\n{{multiple image\n| footer =  [[Claude Debussy]] ''(left)'' named this prelude after [[Leconte de Lisle]]'s ''(right)'' poem by the same name.\n| image1 = Claude Debussy ca 1908, foto av F\u00e9lix Nadar.jpg\n| alt1 = A man with a beard and moustache facing right wearing a black jacket and bow tie.\n| width1 = 174\n| image2 = Leconte Blanquer.JPG\n| alt2 = Coloured portrait of a man with long white hair balding in the middle in jacket facing forward.\n| width2 = 150\n}}\nThe title ''La fille aux cheveux de lin'' was inspired by [[Leconte de Lisle]]'s poem by the same name, one of his ''Chansons \u00e9cossaises'' (Scottish songs) from his 1852 collection ''Po\u00e8mes antiques'' (Ancient Poems).<ref name=Bruhn>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/imagesideasinmod00bruh|url-access=registration|quote=girl with the flaxen hair.|title=Images and Ideas in Modern French Piano Music: The Extra-musical Subtext in Piano Works by Ravel, Debussy, and Messiaen|publisher=Pendragon Press|date=January 1, 1997|last=Bruhn|first=Siglind|pages=[https://archive.org/details/imagesideasinmod00bruh/page/166 166]\u2013172}}</ref><ref name=Roberts>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEA0Bw2H69gC&pg=PA256&dq=girl+with+the+flaxen+hair|title=Images: The Piano Music of Claude Debussy|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|year=2001|last=Roberts|first=Paul|pages=242, 252, 256\u2013257}}</ref>  The image of a girl with flaxen-coloured hair has been utilized in [[fine art]] as a symbol of [[innocence]] and [[naivety]].<ref name=Bruhn/>  Musical writers have suggested that Debussy's successful portrayal of these emotions was tied in with the musical simplicity of the prelude\u2014specifically, the technical and harmonic elements.<ref name=Bruhn/><ref name=UFL>{{cite web|title=Recital Program|url=http://portfolios.music.ufl.edu/brevin/recitalprogram.pdf|first=Danielle|last=Kolb|work=UF School of Music|publisher=[[University of Florida]]|accessdate=August 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627040216/http://portfolios.music.ufl.edu/brevin/recitalprogram.pdf|archive-date=June 27, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>  His choice of simplicity for this piece was highly unusual, since it deviated from his style at the time and brought back the simple harmonies that he had utilized in his earlier musical compositions, which were more traditional.<ref name=Bruhn/><ref name=ivory>{{cite web|title=Debussy Pr\u00e9ludes Books I & II|url=http://www.ivoryclassics.com/releases/73004/pdf/booklet.pdf|date=2003|first=Christopher|last=Weiss|work=Ivory Classics|publisher=Ivory Classics Foundation|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDebussy had previously utilized the title for a ''[[m\u00e9lodie]]'' he wrote from 1882 to 1884.<ref name=early>{{cite journal|last=Briscoe|first=James R.|date=Autumn 1981|title=Debussy \"d'apr\u00e8s\" Debussy: The Further Resonance of Two Early \"M\u00e9lodies\"|journal=[[19th-Century Music]]|volume=5|issue=2|pages=110\u2013116|publisher=University of California Press|jstor=746401}} '''{{registration required}}'''</ref>  However, it does not feature any similarities to the 1910 prelude,<ref name=Roberts/> and merely has a \"distant familial relationship\" with the prelude at most according to James R.

It is the eighth piece in the composer's [[Pr\u00e9ludes (Debussy)|first book of ''Pr\u00e9ludes'']], written between late 1909 and early 1910.  The title is in [[French language|French]] and translates roughly to \"The Girl with the [[Flax (color)|Flax]]en Hair\". The piece is 39 [[Bar (music)|measures]] long and takes approximately two and a half minutes to play.  It is in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[G-flat major|G{{music|b}} major]].\n\nThe piece, named after the eponymous poem by [[Leconte de Lisle]], is known for its musical simplicity, a divergence from Debussy's style at the time.  Completed in January 1910, it was published three months later and premiered in June of that same year.  The prelude is one of Debussy's most recorded pieces, both in its original version and in subsequent various arrangements.\n\n==Background and influence==\n{{multiple image\n| footer =  [[Claude Debussy]] ''(left)'' named this prelude after [[Leconte de Lisle]]'s ''(right)'' poem by the same name.\n| image1 = Claude Debussy ca 1908, foto av F\u00e9lix Nadar.jpg\n| alt1 = A man with a beard and moustache facing right wearing a black jacket and bow tie.\n| width1 = 174\n| image2 = Leconte Blanquer.JPG\n| alt2 = Coloured portrait of a man with long white hair balding in the middle in jacket facing forward.\n| width2 = 150\n}}\nThe title ''La fille aux cheveux de lin'' was inspired by [[Leconte de Lisle]]'s poem by the same name, one of his ''Chansons \u00e9cossaises'' (Scottish songs) from his 1852 collection ''Po\u00e8mes antiques'' (Ancient Poems).<ref name=Bruhn>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/imagesideasinmod00bruh|url-access=registration|quote=girl with the flaxen hair.|title=Images and Ideas in Modern French Piano Music: The Extra-musical Subtext in Piano Works by Ravel, Debussy, and Messiaen|publisher=Pendragon Press|date=January 1, 1997|last=Bruhn|first=Siglind|pages=[https://archive.org/details/imagesideasinmod00bruh/page/166 166]\u2013172}}</ref><ref name=Roberts>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hEA0Bw2H69gC&pg=PA256&dq=girl+with+the+flaxen+hair|title=Images: The Piano Music of Claude Debussy|publisher=[[Hal Leonard Corporation]]|year=2001|last=Roberts|first=Paul|pages=242, 252, 256\u2013257}}</ref>  The image of a girl with flaxen-coloured hair has been utilized in [[fine art]] as a symbol of [[innocence]] and [[naivety]].<ref name=Bruhn/>  Musical writers have suggested that Debussy's successful portrayal of these emotions was tied in with the musical simplicity of the prelude\u2014specifically, the technical and harmonic elements.<ref name=Bruhn/><ref name=UFL>{{cite web|title=Recital Program|url=http://portfolios.music.ufl.edu/brevin/recitalprogram.pdf|first=Danielle|last=Kolb|work=UF School of Music|publisher=[[University of Florida]]|accessdate=August 29, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627040216/http://portfolios.music.ufl.edu/brevin/recitalprogram.pdf|archive-date=June 27, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>  His choice of simplicity for this piece was highly unusual, since it deviated from his style at the time and brought back the simple harmonies that he had utilized in his earlier musical compositions, which were more traditional.<ref name=Bruhn/><ref name=ivory>{{cite web|title=Debussy Pr\u00e9ludes Books I & II|url=http://www.ivoryclassics.com/releases/73004/pdf/booklet.pdf|date=2003|first=Christopher|last=Weiss|work=Ivory Classics|publisher=Ivory Classics Foundation|accessdate=August 29, 2012}}</ref>\n\nDebussy had previously utilized the title for a ''[[m\u00e9lodie]]'' he wrote from 1882 to 1884.<ref name=early>{{cite journal|last=Briscoe|first=James R.|date=Autumn 1981|title=Debussy \"d'apr\u00e8s\" Debussy: The Further Resonance of Two Early \"M\u00e9lodies\"|journal=[[19th-Century Music]]|volume=5|issue=2|pages=110\u2013116|publisher=University of California Press|jstor=746401}} '''{{registration required}}'''</ref>  However, it does not feature any similarities to the 1910 prelude,<ref name=Roberts/> and merely has a \"distant familial relationship\" with the prelude at most according to James R.

{"title_page": "Valency (linguistics)", "text_new": "{{Transitivity and Valency}}\n\n{{Short description|Number of arguments controlled by a linguistic predicate}}In [[linguistics]], '''valency''' or '''valence''' is the number of [[verb argument|arguments]] controlled by a [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]], [[Content word|content]] [[Verb|verbs]] being typical predicates. Valency is related, though not identical, to [[subcategorization]] and [[transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]], which count only [[object (grammar)|object]] arguments \u2013 valency counts all arguments, including the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. The linguistic meaning of valency derives from the definition of [[valency (chemistry)|valency]] in [[chemistry]]. The valency metaphor appeared first in linguistics in [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s essay \"The Logic of Relatives\" in 1897,<ref>Przepi\u00f3rkowski (2018) investigates the origins of the valency metaphor in linguistics. He points out that Peirce's use of the valency metaphor is overlooked, [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] being incorrectly credited with having introduced the notion into linguistics.</ref> and it then surfaced in the works of a number of linguists decades later in the late 1940s and 1950s.<ref>Przepi\u00f3rkowski (2018) documents that in addition to Peirce and Tesni\u00e8re, three other linguists employed the metaphor roughly around the same time as Tesni\u00e8re: the Soviet linguist Solomon Davidovi\u010d Kacnel\u2019son (1948), the Dutch linguist Albert Willem de Groot(1949), and the American linguist Charles Hockett (1958).</ref> [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] is credited most with having established the valency concept in linguistics.<ref>Tesni\u00e8re devotes a lengthy and detailed chapter to presenting and exploring the valency concept in his book ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de Syntaxe structurale'' (''Elements of Structural Syntax'') (1959).</ref> A major authority on the valency of the English verb is Allerton (1982), who made the important distinction between semantic and syntactic valency.\n\n==Types==\nThere are several types of valency: \n#impersonal    (=avalent) ''it rains''\n#intransitive  (monovalent/monadic) ''she sleeps''\n#transitive    (divalent/dyadic) ''she kicks the ball''\n#ditransitive  (trivalent/triadic) ''she gave him a book''\n#tritransitive (quadrivalent/quadradic) ''I bet her a dollar on a horse''\n\n*an [[impersonal verb]] has no determinate subject, e.g. ''It rains.'' (Though ''it'' is technically the subject of the verb in English, it is only a [[dummy pronoun|dummy subject]]; that is, a syntactic placeholder: it has no concrete referent. No other subject can replace ''it''. In many other languages, there would be no subject at all. In Spanish, for example, ''It is raining'' could be expressed as simply ''[[:wikt:llueve|llueve]]''.)\n*an [[intransitive]] verb takes one argument, e.g. ''He<sup>1</sup> sleeps.''\n*a [[transitive verb|transitive]] verb takes two, e.g. ''He<sup>1</sup> kicked the ball<sup>2</sup>.''\n*a [[ditransitive]] verb takes three, e.g. ''He<sup>1</sup> gave her<sup>2</sup> a flower<sup>3</sup>.''\n* There are a few verbs that take four arguments; they are [[tritransitive]]. Sometimes ''bet'' is considered to have four arguments in English, as in the examples ''I<sup>1</sup> bet him<sup>2</sup> five quid<sup>3</sup> on \u201dThe Daily Arabian\u201d<sup>4</sup>'' and ''I<sup>1</sup> bet you<sup>2</sup> two dollars<sup>3</sup> it will rain<sup>4</sup>.'' However, since the latter example can be restated as ''I<sup>1</sup> bet you<sup>2</sup> two dollars<sup>3</sup>'' without becoming ungrammatical, the verb ''bet'' is not considered to be a true tritransitive verb{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} (that is, the clause ''it will rain'' is an [[Adjunct_(grammar)|adjunct]], not an [[Argument_(linguistics)|argument]]). Languages that mark arguments morphologically can have true \"tritransitive\" verbs, such as the [[causative]] of a ditransitive verb in [[Abaza language|Abaza]] (which incorporates all four arguments in the sentence \"He couldn't make them give it back to her\" as pronominal prefixes on the verb).<ref>Dixon, R. M. W. (2000). A Typology of Causatives: Form, Syntax, and Meaning. In [[Robert M. W. Dixon|R. M. W. Dixon]] & [[Alexandra Aikhenvald|A. Y. Aikhenvald]] (Eds.), ''Changing Valency: Case Studies in Transitivity'' (pp. 30-41). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.</ref><sup>: p. 57</sup>\n\nThe term '''valence''' also refers to the syntactic category of these elements. Verbs show considerable variety in this respect. In the examples above, the arguments are [[noun phrase]]s (NPs). But arguments can in many cases be other categories, e.g.\n\n:'''Winning the prize''' made our training worthwhile. <small>\u2013 Subject is a non-finite verb phrase</small>\n:'''That he came late''' did not surprise us. <small>\u2013 Subject is a clause</small>\n:Sam persuaded us '''to contribute to the cause'''. <small>\u2013 Object is a non-finite verb phrase</small>\n:The president mentioned '''that she would veto this bill'''. <small>\u2013 Object is a clause</small>\n\nMany of these patterns can appear in a form rather different from the ones just shown above. For example, they can also be expressed using the passive voice:\n\n:Our training was made worthwhile (by winning the prize).\n:We were not surprised (by the fact that he came late).\n:We were persuaded to contribute (by Sam).\n:That she would veto this bill was mentioned (by the president).\n\nThe above examples show some of the most common valence patterns in English, but do not begin to exhaust them. Other linguists{{Who|date=May 2016}} have examined the patterns of more than three thousand verbs and placed them in one or more of several dozen groups.<ref>Concerning the valency patterns, see Levin (1993).</ref>\n\nThe verb requires all of its arguments in a well-formed sentence, although they can sometimes undergo valency reduction or expansion. For instance, ''to eat'' is naturally divalent, as in ''he eats an apple'', but may be reduced to monovalency in ''he eats''. This is called ''valency reduction''. In the southeastern United States, an emphatic trivalent form of ''eat'' is in use, as in ''I'll eat myself some supper''. Verbs that are usually monovalent, like ''sleep'', cannot take a direct object. However, there are cases where the valency of such verbs can be expanded, for instance in ''He sleeps the sleep of death.'' This is called ''valency expansion''. Verb valence can also be described in terms of syntactic versus [[Semantics|semantic]] criteria. The syntactic valency of a verb refers to the number of dependent arguments that the verb can have, while semantic valence describes the [[thematic relation]]s associated with a verb.\n\n==Compared with subcategorization==\nTesni\u00e8re 1959<ref>The quotation is from Tesni\u00e8re (1959/69:238).</ref> expresses the idea of valence as follows (translation from French):\n\n:\"One can therefore compare the verb to a sort of atom with bonds, susceptible to exercising attraction on a greater or lesser number of actants. For these actants, the verb has a greater or lesser number of bonds that maintain the actants as dependents. The number of bonds that a verb has constitutes what we will call the '''valence''' of the verb.\"\n\nTesni\u00e8re used the word ''actants'' to mean what are now widely called [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]]s (and sometimes [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]s). An important aspect of Tesni\u00e8re's understanding of valency was that the subject is an actant (=argument, complement) of the verb in the same manner that the object is.<ref>Tesni\u00e8re (1959/69:109) emphasizes that the subject is a complement just like the object in chapter 51, paragraph 109.</ref> The concept of [[subcategorization frame|subcategorization]], which is related to valency but associated more with [[phrase structure grammar]]s than with the [[dependency grammar]] that Tesni\u00e8re developed, did not originally view the subject as part of the subcategorization frame,<ref>Concerning an early and prominent account of subcategorization, see Chomsky (1965).</ref> although the more modern understanding of subcategorization seems to be almost synonymous with valency.\n\n==Changing valency==\nMost languages provide a means to change the valency of verbs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hovdhaugen, Even |first1=and Ulrike Mosel |title=Samoan Reference Grammar |date=1992 |publisher=Scandinavian University Press |location=Oslo |page=729}}</ref> There are two ways to change the valency of a verb: reducing and increasing.<ref name=DixAikh1997>[[R. M. W. Dixon|Dixon, R. M. W.]] & [[Alexandra Aikhenvald]] (1997). \"A Typology of Argument-Determined Constructions. pp 71\u2013112 of Bybee, Joan, John Haiman, & Sandra A. Thompson (eds.)(1997). ''Essays on Language Function and Language Type: Dedicated to T. Giv\u00f3n''. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.</ref>{{rp|72}}\n\nNote that for this section, the labels S, A, and P will be used. These are commonly used names (taken from [[morphosyntactic alignment]] theory) given to [[argument (linguistics)|arguments]] of a verb. S refers to the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of an [[intransitive verb]], A refers to the [[agent (grammar)|agent]] of a [[transitive verb]], and P refers to the [[patient (grammar)|patient]] of a [[transitive verb]]. (The patient is sometimes also called undergoer.)\n\nThese are '''core''' arguments of a verb:\n*''Lydia'' (S) ''is sleeping.''\n*''Don'' (A) ''is cooking dinner'' (P).\nNon-core (or peripheral) arguments are called [[Oblique argument|obliques]] and are typically optional:\n*''Lydia is sleeping '''on the couch'''.\n*''Don is cooking dinner '''for his mom'''.\n\n===Valency-reducing===\nReducing valency involves moving an argument from the core to oblique status. The [[passive voice]] and [[antipassive voice]] are prototypical valency reducing devices.<ref name=DixAikh1997/>{{rp|72}} This kind of derivation applies most to [[transitive verb|transitive]] clauses. Since there are two arguments in a transitive clause, A and P, there are two possibilities for reducing the valency:\n:1. A is removed from the core and becomes an oblique. The clause becomes intransitive since there's only one core argument, the original P, which has become S. This is exactly what the [[passive voice]] does.<ref name=DixAikh1997/>{{rp|73}} The semantics of this construction emphasizes the original P and downgrades the original A and is used to avoid mentioning A, draw attention to P or the result of the activity.<ref name=DixAikh1997/>{{rp|474}} \n:::(a) ''Don'' (A) ''is cooking dinner'' (P).\n:::(b) ''Dinner'' (S) '' is being cooked ''('''''by Don'''''). \n:2. P is moved from the core and becomes an oblique. Similarly, the clause becomes intransitive and the original A becomes S.<ref name=DixAikh1997/>{{rp|73}} The semantics of this construction emphasizes the original A and downgrades the original P and is used when the action includes a patient, but the patient is given little or no attention.<ref name=DixAikh1997/>{{rp|474}} These are difficult to convey in English. \n:::(a) ''Don'' (A) ''is crushing a soda can'' (P).\n:::(b) ''Don'' (S) ''is crushing.'' [with the implication that a soda can is being crushed].\n::Note that this is not the same as an [[ambitransitive verb]], which can be either intransitive or transitive (see criterion 4 below, which this does not meet).\n\nThere are some problems, however, with the terms ''passive'' and ''antipassive'' because they have been used to describe a wide range of behaviors across the world's languages. For example, when compared to a canonical European passive, the passive construction in other languages is justified in its name. However, when comparing passives across the world's languages, they do not share a single common feature.<ref name=Siewierska>Siewierska, Anna (1984). ''Passive: A Comparative Linguistic Analysis''. London: Croom Helm.</ref>{{rp|255}}\n\n[[R. M. W. Dixon]] has proposed four properties of passives and antipassives.<ref name=Ergativity>[[R. M. W. Dixon|Dixon, R.M.W.]] (1994). ''Ergativity''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>{{rp|146}}\n\n# They apply to underlying transitive clauses and form a derived intransitive.\n# The underlying P of the passive and A of the antipassive become S.\n# The underlying A of the passive and P of the antipassive go into the periphery and are marked by a non-core case/preposition/etc. These can be omitted, but there's always the option of including them.\n# There is some explicit marking of the construction.\nHe acknowledges that this excludes some constructions labeled as \"passive\" by some linguists.\n\nOther ways to reduce valency include the [[Reflexive verb|reflexives]], [[Reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocals]], [[Direct\u2013inverse language|inverse constructions]], [[Voice (grammar)#Middle|middle voice]], [[object demotion]], noun [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]], and object incorporation.<ref name=Morphosyntax>Payne, Thomas E.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>{{rp|196\u2013222}}\n\n===Valency-increasing===\nThis involves moving an argument from the periphery into the core. [[Applicative voice|Applicatives]] and [[causative]]s are prototypical valency increasing devices.<ref name=DixAikh1997/>{{rp|73}} \n\n==In syntactic theory==\nValence plays an important role in a number of the syntactic frameworks that have been developed in the last few decades. In [[generalized phrase structure grammar]] (GPSG),<ref>Concerning GPSG, see Gazdar et al. (1985).</ref> many of the phrase structure rules generate the class of verbs with a particular valence. For example, the following rule generates the class of transitive verbs:\n\n::VP \u2192 H NP [love]\n\nH stands for the [[Head (linguistics)|head]] of the VP, that is the part which shares the same category as the VP, in this case, the verb. Some linguists objected that there would be one such rule for every valence pattern. Such a list would miss the fact that all such rules have certain properties in common. Work in [[government and binding]] (GB)<ref>The classical work in GB is Chomsky (1981).</ref> takes the approach of generating all such structures with a single schema, called the [[X-bar theory|X-bar schema]]:<ref>A classic work establishing the X-bar schema is Jackendoff (1977).</ref>\n\n::X\u2032 \u2192 X, Y\u2033...\n\nX and Y can stand for a number of different lexical categories, and each instance of the symbol \u2032 stands for a bar. So A\u2032, for instance, would be a kind of AP (adjective phrase). Two bars, used here for the complements, is thought by some linguists to be a maximal projection of a lexical category. Such a schema is meant to be combined with specific lexical rules and the ''projection principle'' to distinguish the various patterns of specific verbs.\n\n[[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG)<ref>The classic work of HPSG is Pollard and Sag (1994).</ref> introduces a handful of such schemata which aim to subsume all such valence related rules as well as other rules not related to valence. A network is developed for information related to specific lexical items.

Valency is related, though not identical, to [[subcategorization]] and [[transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]], which count only [[object (grammar)|object]] arguments \u2013 valency counts all arguments, including the [[subject (grammar)|subject]]. The linguistic meaning of valency derives from the definition of [[valency (chemistry)|valency]] in [[chemistry]]. The valency metaphor appeared first in linguistics in [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]'s essay \"The Logic of Relatives\" in 1897,<ref>Przepi\u00f3rkowski (2018) investigates the origins of the valency metaphor in linguistics. He points out that Peirce's use of the valency metaphor is overlooked, [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] being incorrectly credited with having introduced the notion into linguistics.</ref> and it then surfaced in the works of a number of linguists decades later in the late 1940s and 1950s.<ref>Przepi\u00f3rkowski (2018) documents that in addition to Peirce and Tesni\u00e8re, three other linguists employed the metaphor roughly around the same time as Tesni\u00e8re: the Soviet linguist Solomon Davidovi\u010d Kacnel\u2019son (1948), the Dutch linguist Albert Willem de Groot(1949), and the American linguist Charles Hockett (1958).</ref> [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] is credited most with having established the valency concept in linguistics.<ref>Tesni\u00e8re devotes a lengthy and detailed chapter to presenting and exploring the valency concept in his book ''\u00c9l\u00e9ments de Syntaxe structurale'' (''Elements of Structural Syntax'') (1959).</ref> A major authority on the valency of the English verb is Allerton (1982), who made the important distinction between semantic and syntactic valency.\n\n==Types==\nThere are several types of valency: \n#impersonal    (=avalent) ''it rains''\n#intransitive  (monovalent/monadic) ''she sleeps''\n#transitive    (divalent/dyadic) ''she kicks the ball''\n#ditransitive  (trivalent/triadic) ''she gave him a book''\n#tritransitive (quadrivalent/quadradic) ''I bet her a dollar on a horse''\n\n*an [[impersonal verb]] has no determinate subject, e.g. ''It rains.'' (Though ''it'' is technically the subject of the verb in English, it is only a [[dummy pronoun|dummy subject]]; that is, a syntactic placeholder: it has no concrete referent. No other subject can replace ''it''. In many other languages, there would be no subject at all. In Spanish, for example, ''It is raining'' could be expressed as simply ''[[:wikt:llueve|llueve]]''.)\n*an [[intransitive]] verb takes one argument, e.g. ''He<sup>1</sup> sleeps.''\n*a [[transitive verb|transitive]] verb takes two, e.g. ''He<sup>1</sup> kicked the ball<sup>2</sup>.''\n*a [[ditransitive]] verb takes three, e.g. ''He<sup>1</sup> gave her<sup>2</sup> a flower<sup>3</sup>.''\n* There are a few verbs that take four arguments; they are [[tritransitive]]. Sometimes ''bet'' is considered to have four arguments in English, as in the examples ''I<sup>1</sup> bet him<sup>2</sup> five quid<sup>3</sup> on \u201dThe Daily Arabian\u201d<sup>4</sup>'' and ''I<sup>1</sup> bet you<sup>2</sup> two dollars<sup>3</sup> it will rain<sup>4</sup>.'' However, since the latter example can be restated as ''I<sup>1</sup> bet you<sup>2</sup> two dollars<sup>3</sup>'' without becoming ungrammatical, the verb ''bet'' is not considered to be a true tritransitive verb{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} (that is, the clause ''it will rain'' is an [[Adjunct_(grammar)|adjunct]], not an [[Argument_(linguistics)|argument]]). Languages that mark arguments morphologically can have true \"tritransitive\" verbs, such as the [[causative]] of a ditransitive verb in [[Abaza language|Abaza]] (which incorporates all four arguments in the sentence \"He couldn't make them give it back to her\" as pronominal prefixes on the verb).<ref>Dixon, R. M. W. (2000). A Typology of Causatives: Form, Syntax, and Meaning. In [[Robert M. W. Dixon|R. M. W. Dixon]] & [[Alexandra Aikhenvald|A. Y. Aikhenvald]] (Eds.), ''Changing Valency: Case Studies in Transitivity'' (pp. 30-41). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.</ref><sup>: p. 57</sup>\n\nThe term '''valence''' also refers to the syntactic category of these elements. Verbs show considerable variety in this respect. In the examples above, the arguments are [[noun phrase]]s (NPs). But arguments can in many cases be other categories, e.g.\n\n:'''Winning the prize''' made our training worthwhile. <small>\u2013 Subject is a non-finite verb phrase</small>\n:'''That he came late''' did not surprise us. <small>\u2013 Subject is a clause</small>\n:Sam persuaded us '''to contribute to the cause'''. <small>\u2013 Object is a non-finite verb phrase</small>\n:The president mentioned '''that she would veto this bill'''. <small>\u2013 Object is a clause</small>\n\nMany of these patterns can appear in a form rather different from the ones just shown above. For example, they can also be expressed using the passive voice:\n\n:Our training was made worthwhile (by winning the prize).\n:We were not surprised (by the fact that he came late).\n:We were persuaded to contribute (by Sam).\n:That she would veto this bill was mentioned (by the president).\n\nThe above examples show some of the most common valence patterns in English, but do not begin to exhaust them. Other linguists{{Who|date=May 2016}} have examined the patterns of more than three thousand verbs and placed them in one or more of several dozen groups.<ref>Concerning the valency patterns, see Levin (1993).</ref>\n\nThe verb requires all of its arguments in a well-formed sentence, although they can sometimes undergo valency reduction or expansion. For instance, ''to eat'' is naturally divalent, as in ''he eats an apple'', but may be reduced to monovalency in ''he eats''. This is called ''valency reduction''. In the southeastern United States, an emphatic trivalent form of ''eat'' is in use, as in ''I'll eat myself some supper''. Verbs that are usually monovalent, like ''sleep'', cannot take a direct object. However, there are cases where the valency of such verbs can be expanded, for instance in ''He sleeps the sleep of death.'' This is called ''valency expansion''. Verb valence can also be described in terms of syntactic versus [[Semantics|semantic]] criteria. The syntactic valency of a verb refers to the number of dependent arguments that the verb can have, while semantic valence describes the [[thematic relation]]s associated with a verb.\n\n==Compared with subcategorization==\nTesni\u00e8re 1959<ref>The quotation is from Tesni\u00e8re (1959/69:238).</ref> expresses the idea of valence as follows (translation from French):\n\n:\"One can therefore compare the verb to a sort of atom with bonds, susceptible to exercising attraction on a greater or lesser number of actants. For these actants, the verb has a greater or lesser number of bonds that maintain the actants as dependents. The number of bonds that a verb has constitutes what we will call the '''valence''' of the verb.\"\n\nTesni\u00e8re used the word ''actants'' to mean what are now widely called [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]]s (and sometimes [[Complement (linguistics)|complement]]s). An important aspect of Tesni\u00e8re's understanding of valency was that the subject is an actant (=argument, complement) of the verb in the same manner that the object is.<ref>Tesni\u00e8re (1959/69:109) emphasizes that the subject is a complement just like the object in chapter 51, paragraph 109.</ref> The concept of [[subcategorization frame|subcategorization]], which is related to valency but associated more with [[phrase structure grammar]]s than with the [[dependency grammar]] that Tesni\u00e8re developed, did not originally view the subject as part of the subcategorization frame,<ref>Concerning an early and prominent account of subcategorization, see Chomsky (1965).</ref> although the more modern understanding of subcategorization seems to be almost synonymous with valency.\n\n==Changing valency==\nMost languages provide a means to change the valency of verbs.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hovdhaugen, Even |first1=and Ulrike Mosel |title=Samoan Reference Grammar |date=1992 |publisher=Scandinavian University Press |location=Oslo |page=729}}</ref> There are two ways to change the valency of a verb: reducing and increasing.<ref name=DixAikh1997>[[R. M. W. Dixon|Dixon, R. M. W.]] & [[Alexandra Aikhenvald]] (1997). \"A Typology of Argument-Determined Constructions. pp 71\u2013112 of Bybee, Joan, John Haiman, & Sandra A. Thompson (eds.)(1997). ''Essays on Language Function and Language Type: Dedicated to T. Giv\u00f3n''. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.</ref>{{rp|72}}\n\nNote that for this section, the labels S, A, and P will be used. These are commonly used names (taken from [[morphosyntactic alignment]] theory) given to [[argument (linguistics)|arguments]] of a verb. S refers to the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of an [[intransitive verb]], A refers to the [[agent (grammar)|agent]] of a [[transitive verb]], and P refers to the [[patient (grammar)|patient]] of a [[transitive verb]]. (The patient is sometimes also called undergoer.)\n\nThese are '''core''' arguments of a verb:\n*''Lydia'' (S) ''is sleeping.''\n*''Don'' (A) ''is cooking dinner'' (P).\nNon-core (or peripheral) arguments are called [[Oblique argument|obliques]] and are typically optional:\n*''Lydia is sleeping '''on the couch'''.\n*''Don is cooking dinner '''for his mom'''.\n\n===Valency-reducing===\nReducing valency involves moving an argument from the core to oblique status. The [[passive voice]] and [[antipassive voice]] are prototypical valency reducing devices.<ref name=DixAikh1997/>{{rp|72}} This kind of derivation applies most to [[transitive verb|transitive]] clauses. Since there are two arguments in a transitive clause, A and P, there are two possibilities for reducing the valency:\n:1. A is removed from the core and becomes an oblique. The clause becomes intransitive since there's only one core argument, the original P, which has become S. This is exactly what the [[passive voice]] does.<ref name=DixAikh1997/>{{rp|73}} The semantics of this construction emphasizes the original P and downgrades the original A and is used to avoid mentioning A, draw attention to P or the result of the activity.<ref name=DixAikh1997/>{{rp|474}} \n:::(a) ''Don'' (A) ''is cooking dinner'' (P).\n:::(b) ''Dinner'' (S) '' is being cooked ''('''''by Don'''''). \n:2. P is moved from the core and becomes an oblique. Similarly, the clause becomes intransitive and the original A becomes S.<ref name=DixAikh1997/>{{rp|73}} The semantics of this construction emphasizes the original A and downgrades the original P and is used when the action includes a patient, but the patient is given little or no attention.<ref name=DixAikh1997/>{{rp|474}} These are difficult to convey in English. \n:::(a) ''Don'' (A) ''is crushing a soda can'' (P).\n:::(b) ''Don'' (S) ''is crushing.'' [with the implication that a soda can is being crushed].\n::Note that this is not the same as an [[ambitransitive verb]], which can be either intransitive or transitive (see criterion 4 below, which this does not meet).\n\nThere are some problems, however, with the terms ''passive'' and ''antipassive'' because they have been used to describe a wide range of behaviors across the world's languages. For example, when compared to a canonical European passive, the passive construction in other languages is justified in its name. However, when comparing passives across the world's languages, they do not share a single common feature.<ref name=Siewierska>Siewierska, Anna (1984). ''Passive: A Comparative Linguistic Analysis''. London: Croom Helm.</ref>{{rp|255}}\n\n[[R. M. W. Dixon]] has proposed four properties of passives and antipassives.<ref name=Ergativity>[[R. M. W. Dixon|Dixon, R.M.W.]] (1994). ''Ergativity''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>{{rp|146}}\n\n# They apply to underlying transitive clauses and form a derived intransitive.\n# The underlying P of the passive and A of the antipassive become S.\n# The underlying A of the passive and P of the antipassive go into the periphery and are marked by a non-core case/preposition/etc. These can be omitted, but there's always the option of including them.\n# There is some explicit marking of the construction.\nHe acknowledges that this excludes some constructions labeled as \"passive\" by some linguists.\n\nOther ways to reduce valency include the [[Reflexive verb|reflexives]], [[Reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocals]], [[Direct\u2013inverse language|inverse constructions]], [[Voice (grammar)#Middle|middle voice]], [[object demotion]], noun [[Incorporation (linguistics)|incorporation]], and object incorporation.<ref name=Morphosyntax>Payne, Thomas E.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.</ref>{{rp|196\u2013222}}\n\n===Valency-increasing===\nThis involves moving an argument from the periphery into the core. [[Applicative voice|Applicatives]] and [[causative]]s are prototypical valency increasing devices.<ref name=DixAikh1997/>{{rp|73}} \n\n==In syntactic theory==\nValence plays an important role in a number of the syntactic frameworks that have been developed in the last few decades. In [[generalized phrase structure grammar]] (GPSG),<ref>Concerning GPSG, see Gazdar et al. (1985).</ref> many of the phrase structure rules generate the class of verbs with a particular valence. For example, the following rule generates the class of transitive verbs:\n\n::VP \u2192 H NP [love]\n\nH stands for the [[Head (linguistics)|head]] of the VP, that is the part which shares the same category as the VP, in this case, the verb. Some linguists objected that there would be one such rule for every valence pattern. Such a list would miss the fact that all such rules have certain properties in common. Work in [[government and binding]] (GB)<ref>The classical work in GB is Chomsky (1981).</ref> takes the approach of generating all such structures with a single schema, called the [[X-bar theory|X-bar schema]]:<ref>A classic work establishing the X-bar schema is Jackendoff (1977).</ref>\n\n::X\u2032 \u2192 X, Y\u2033...\n\nX and Y can stand for a number of different lexical categories, and each instance of the symbol \u2032 stands for a bar. So A\u2032, for instance, would be a kind of AP (adjective phrase). Two bars, used here for the complements, is thought by some linguists to be a maximal projection of a lexical category. Such a schema is meant to be combined with specific lexical rules and the ''projection principle'' to distinguish the various patterns of specific verbs.\n\n[[Head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG)<ref>The classic work of HPSG is Pollard and Sag (1994).</ref> introduces a handful of such schemata which aim to subsume all such valence related rules as well as other rules not related to valence. A network is developed for information related to specific lexical items. The network and one of the schemata aims to subsume the large number of specific rules defining the valence of particular lexical items.\n\nNotice that the rule (VP \u2192 H NP [love]) and the schema (X\u2032 \u2192 X, Y\u2033...) deal only with non-subject complements. This is because all of the above syntactic frameworks use a totally separate rule (or schema) to introduce the subject. This is a major difference between them and Tesni\u00e8re's original understanding of valency, which included the subject, as mentioned above.\n\nOne of the most widely known versions of [[construction grammar]] (CxG)<ref>A seminal work for the development of CxG is Goldberg (1995).</ref> also treats the subject like other complements, but this may be because the emphasis is more on semantic roles and compatibility with work in [[cognitive science]] than on syntax.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Argument (linguistics)|Argument]]\n*[[Arity]]\n*[[Case grammar]]\n*[[Dependency grammar]]\n*[[Grammatical conjugation]]\n*[[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]]\n*[[Morphosyntactic alignment]]\n*[[Phrase structure grammar]]\n*[[Subcategorization]]\n*[[Transitivity (grammar)|Transitivity]]\n*[[Verb]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Allerton, D.

She was a member of a modest working-class family (her father was a quarry worker) that regularly practised the Catholic faith. She went to school in the village of Bamenohl. The terrible economic situation in the [[Weimar Republic]] meant that she had to go out to work in the clothing store Bischoff & Broegger in [[Finnentrop]], where she was popular amongst both fellow workers and customers\n\nMaria was thirty-three years old when she joined the Trinitarian Sisters of Valencia in [[M\u00f6tz]], [[Austria]]. She began the novitiate and was given the name Angela Maria of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The novitiate ended with the first profession of vows on August 16, 1934. Her final profession took place on September 28, 1938, the year Hitler annexed Austria.\n\nOn the morning of August 10, 1940, Sr Angela went to buy some milk. She happened to meet some women she knew at the dairy and, conversing with them, she related that  the Allies had sunk a German ship off Norway and many had died in that disaster. She ended saying ''Hitler is a calamity for Europe''.<ref>Anthony O. D'Errico, ''The Trinitarians'', Roma, 1997, 421.</ref> One of the women, a known Nazi sympathizer, related to her son, also a Nazi sympathizer, what she had heard from Sr. Angela. He reported the fact to the chief of the [[Gestapo]].\n\nThe Gestapo opened a file on Sr. Angela and arrested her on August 12, 1940. She was jailed for seventeen days in Innsbruck before becoming prisoner no. 4651 in the concentration camp of [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp|Ravensbr\u00fcck]] on August 31, 1940. There she was a light of hope and courage to her fellow inmates. She was frequently beaten by her captors but her contagious good humor was \"a ray of sunshine in deepest Hell\". Some prisoners who might have killed themselves were inspired by her, they said afterwards, even those who had no idea that she was a nun.<ref>Anthony O.

She was a member of a modest working-class family (her father was a quarry worker) that regularly practised the Catholic faith. She went to school in the village of Bamenohl. The terrible economic situation in the [[Weimar Republic]] meant that she had to go out to work in the clothing store Bischoff & Broegger in [[Finnentrop]], where she was popular amongst both fellow workers and customers\n\nMaria was thirty-three years old when she joined the Trinitarian Sisters of Valencia in [[M\u00f6tz]], [[Austria]]. She began the novitiate and was given the name Angela Maria of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. The novitiate ended with the first profession of vows on August 16, 1934. Her final profession took place on September 28, 1938, the year Hitler annexed Austria.\n\nOn the morning of August 10, 1940, Sr Angela went to buy some milk. She happened to meet some women she knew at the dairy and, conversing with them, she related that  the Allies had sunk a German ship off Norway and many had died in that disaster. She ended saying ''Hitler is a calamity for Europe''.<ref>Anthony O. D'Errico, ''The Trinitarians'', Roma, 1997, 421.</ref> One of the women, a known Nazi sympathizer, related to her son, also a Nazi sympathizer, what she had heard from Sr. Angela. He reported the fact to the chief of the [[Gestapo]].\n\nThe Gestapo opened a file on Sr. Angela and arrested her on August 12, 1940. She was jailed for seventeen days in Innsbruck before becoming prisoner no. 4651 in the concentration camp of [[Ravensbr\u00fcck concentration camp|Ravensbr\u00fcck]] on August 31, 1940. There she was a light of hope and courage to her fellow inmates. She was frequently beaten by her captors but her contagious good humor was \"a ray of sunshine in deepest Hell\". Some prisoners who might have killed themselves were inspired by her, they said afterwards, even those who had no idea that she was a nun.<ref>Anthony O. D'Errico, ''The Trinitarians'', Roma, 1997, 422-423.</ref>\n\nThe Nazis sent Sr. Angela to Auschwitz where she befriended a Jewish woman doctor from Slovakia, Margarita Schwalbova.

Recently [[Fitzherbert]] Ward was amalgamated with Ashhurst Ward.\n\nThe ward is predominantly rural, with most of the population living in Ashhurst, Aokautere and Linton. The area varies from the suburban to the foothills of the [[Tararua Ranges]] to the river valleys of the Manawatu and Pohangina Rivers.\n\nThe Saddle Road Bridge, which crosses this river, had to be recently replaced due to floods in 2004 when a flooded [[Pohangina River]] swept the bridge away.\nSaddle Road is the alternative route east when the [[Manawatu Gorge]] is closed.\n\nThere is an increasing amount of development in the area especially around [[Aokautere]] and Summerhill.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\nBecause of the higher ground on the south bank of the Manawatu, there are views of the [[Ruahine Ranges]] and the northern parts of the city.

Recently [[Fitzherbert]] Ward was amalgamated with Ashhurst Ward.\n\nThe ward is predominantly rural, with most of the population living in Ashhurst, Aokautere and Linton. The area varies from the suburban to the foothills of the [[Tararua Ranges]] to the river valleys of the Manawatu and Pohangina Rivers.\n\nThe Saddle Road Bridge, which crosses this river, had to be recently replaced due to floods in 2004 when a flooded [[Pohangina River]] swept the bridge away.\nSaddle Road is the alternative route east when the [[Manawatu Gorge]] is closed.\n\nThere is an increasing amount of development in the area especially around [[Aokautere]] and Summerhill.{{fact|date=December 2017}}\n\nBecause of the higher ground on the south bank of the Manawatu, there are views of the [[Ruahine Ranges]] and the northern parts of the city. On a clear day it is possible to see [[Mount Ruapehu|Ruapehu]], [[Ngauruhoe]] and [[Mount Taranaki|Taranaki]].\n\n{| class=\"infobox bordered\" align=left cellpadding=4 cellspacing=0 width=275 style=\"clear:right; margin: 0 0 1em 1em; background: #f9f9f9;  font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n|colspan=3 align=center bgcolor=\"#f9f9f9\"|<big>Wards of Palmerston North</big>\n|-\n!
