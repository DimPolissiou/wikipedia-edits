The adopted [[livery]] was mainly white, with the name of the airline written in blue on the forward [[fuselage]], the 'B' logo being heavily stylized in blue checks. The checker blue pattern was repeated on the aircraft [[Vertical stabilizer|tailfin]].\n\nIn 1999, airBaltic became a [[joint stock company]]; it was previously a [[limited liability company]].<ref name=\"Hist\">\"[http://www.airbaltic.com/public/company_history.html Company history].\" AirBaltic. Retrieved on 22 November 2011.</ref> All of their Saab 340s were replaced by Fokker 50s. By September, the airline had begun operating under the European Aviation Operating Standards, or JAR ops. Air Baltic welcomed the new millennium by introducing new uniforms and opening a cargo centre at Riga's airport.\n\nThe first [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-500]] joined the fleet in 2003, and on 1 June 2004, Air Baltic launched services from the Lithuanian capital, [[Vilnius]], initially to five destinations. In October 2004, Air Baltic was rebranded as '''AirBaltic'''. Their present livery consists of an all-white fuselage and [[lime (color)|lime]] tailfin. AirBaltic.com is displayed on the forward upper fuselage, and the word \"Baltic\" is repeated in blue on the lower part of the tailfin. In December 2006, the first Boeing 737-300 joined the fleet and was configured with [[winglet]]s.

Some of AirBaltic's products and services are still shared with SAS, including co-ordinated timetabling and shared airport lounges.

The checker blue pattern was repeated on the aircraft [[Vertical stabilizer|tailfin]].\n\nIn 1999, airBaltic became a [[joint stock company]]; it was previously a [[limited liability company]].<ref name=\"Hist\">\"[http://www.airbaltic.com/public/company_history.html Company history].\" AirBaltic. Retrieved on 22 November 2011.</ref> All of their Saab 340s were replaced by Fokker 50s. By September, the airline had begun operating under the European Aviation Operating Standards, or JAR ops. Air Baltic welcomed the new millennium by introducing new uniforms and opening a cargo centre at Riga's airport.\n\nThe first [[Boeing 737 Classic|Boeing 737-500]] joined the fleet in 2003, and on 1 June 2004, Air Baltic launched services from the Lithuanian capital, [[Vilnius]], initially to five destinations. In October 2004, Air Baltic was rebranded as '''AirBaltic'''. Their present livery consists of an all-white fuselage and [[lime (color)|lime]] tailfin. AirBaltic.com is displayed on the forward upper fuselage, and the word \"Baltic\" is repeated in blue on the lower part of the tailfin. In December 2006, the first Boeing 737-300 joined the fleet and was configured with [[winglet]]s. In July 2007, AirBaltic introduced an online check-in system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airbaltic.com/public/31274.html |title=airBaltic introduces Internet check-in for flights |publisher=Airbaltic.com |date=2007-07-31 |accessdate=2013-04-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703064929/http://www.airbaltic.com/public/31274.html |archivedate=2012-07-03 }}</ref> It was the first online check-in system in the Baltic states. In the spring of 2008, two long-haul [[Boeing 757]]s joined the existing AirBaltic fleet. On 10 March 2008, it was announced that in the next three years the airline would acquire new aircraft, experiencing the largest fleet expansion in the company's history. The new additions will be next generation [[De Havilland Canada Dash 8|De Havilland Dash 8-400]] aircraft.\n\nAirBaltic had strong links with SAS, which owned 47.2% of the airline, and operated frequent flights to SAS hubs in [[Copenhagen]], [[Oslo]] and [[Stockholm]]. Some of AirBaltic's products and services are still shared with SAS, including co-ordinated timetabling and shared airport lounges. AirBaltic is not a member of any [[airline alliance]] but does have codeshare agreements in place with several [[Star Alliance]] member airlines and others.\n\nAirBaltic had secondary hubs at [[Vilnius Airport]] and [[Tallinn Airport]].<ref name=\"Opening of base at Tallinn\">{{cite web |url=http://www.easier.com/68507-airbaltic-to-open-tallinn-base.html |title=Opening of Tallinn Base |accessdate= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |year= |month= |work= |publisher= }}</ref> The majority of the routes commenced from Tallinn were cancelled shortly after opening, leading to complaints from the Estonian Consumer Protection Department.<ref name=\"Consumer Protection Department Warning re AirBaltic\">{{cite web|url=http://bnn-news.com/estonians-warned-to-be-careful-with-airbaltic-5498|title=Estonians warned to be careful with ''airBaltic''|last=|first=|date=October 15, 2010|website=|publisher=Baltic News Network|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|accessdate=2013-04-20}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2009, SAS sold its entire stake in the company (47.2% of the airline) to Baltijas avi\u0101cijas sist\u0113mas Ltd (BAS) for 14 million lats.

Part of social anxiety is fear of being criticized by others, and in children, social anxiety causes extreme distress over everyday activities such as playing with other kids, reading in class, or speaking to adults. On the other hand, some children with social anxiety will [[Acting out|act out]] because of their fear. The problem with identifying social anxiety disorder in children is that it can be difficult to determine the difference between social anxiety and basic shyness.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Adalbjarnardottir |first1=Sigrun |date=December 1995 |title=How Schoolchildren Propose to Negotiate: The Role of Social Withdrawal, Social Anxiety, and Locus of Control |journal=Child Development |volume=66 |number=6 |pages=1739\u20131751 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1995.tb00962.x |pmid=8556896}}</ref>\n\n===Adults===\nIt can be easier to identify social anxiety within adults because they tend to shy away from any social situation and keep to themselves. Common adult forms of social anxiety include [[performance anxiety]], [[public speaking anxiety]], [[stage fright]], and [[timidness]]. All of these may also assume clinical forms, i.e., become [[anxiety disorder]]s (see below).<ref name=leitenberg>Harold Leitenberg (1990) \"Handbook of Social and Evaluation Anxiety\", {{ISBN|0-306-43438-5}}</ref>  \n\nCriteria that distinguish between [[Illness|clinical]] and nonclinical forms of social anxiety include the intensity and level of behavioral and psychosomatic disruption (discomfort) in addition to the anticipatory nature of the fear.<ref name=\"leitenberg\"/> Social anxieties may also be classified according to the broadness of triggering social situations. For example, [[fear of eating in public]] has a very narrow situational scope (eating in public), while [[shyness]] may have a wide scope (a person may be shy of doing many things in various circumstances).<ref name=\"leitenberg\"/> The clinical (disorder) forms are also divided into general social phobia (i.e., [[social anxiety disorder]]) and [[specific social phobia]].\n\n==Disorder==\n{{Main article|Social anxiety disorder}}\n<!--THIS IS A COPY OF THE LEAD OF THE SAD ARTICLE.

Social anxiety is strongly associated with self-perceived blushing, weakly associated with blushing as measured by physiological indices such as temperature and blood flow to the cheeks and forehead, and moderately associated with observed blushing. The relationship between physiological blushing and self-perceived blushing is small among those high in social anxiety, indicating that individuals with high social anxiety may overestimate their blushing.<ref name=\":0\" /> That social anxiety is associated most strongly with self-perceived blushing is also important for [[Cognition|cognitive]] models of blushing and social anxiety, indicating that socially anxious individuals use both internal cues and other types of information to draw conclusions about how they are coming across.<ref name=\":0\" /> Individuals with social anxiety might also refrain from making eye contact, or constantly fiddling with things during conversations or public speaking. \n\n== Attention bias ==\nIndividuals who tend to experience more social anxiety turn their [[attention]] away from threatening social information and toward themselves, prohibiting them from challenging negative expectations about others and maintaining high levels of social anxiety.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Social phobia: Diagnosis, assessment, and treatment|last=Clark|first=D.M.|last2=Wells|first2=A|publisher=Guilford Press|year=1995|isbn=|editor1=R.G.

One face has an emotional expression and the other has a neutral expression, and when the faces disappear, a probe appears in the location of one of the faces. This creates a congruent condition in which the probe appears in the same location as the emotional face, and an incongruent condition. Participants respond to the probe by pressing a button and differences in reaction times reveal attentional biases. This task has revealed mixed results, with some studies finding no differences between socially anxious individuals and controls, some studies finding avoidance of all faces, and others finding vigilance toward threat faces.<ref name=\":5\" /> There is some evidence that vigilance toward threat faces can be detected during short but not longer exposures to faces, indicating a possible initial hypervigilance followed by avoidance.<ref name=\":5\" /> The Face-in-the-crowd task shows that individuals with social anxiety are faster at detecting an angry face in a predominantly neutral or positive crowd or slower at detecting happy faces than a nonanxious person.<ref name=\":5\" /> Results overall using this task are mixed and this task may not be able to detect hypervigilance toward angry faces in social anxiety.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\nFocus on the [[self]] has been associated with increased social anxiety and [[negative affect]], however there are two types of self-focus: In public self focus, one shows concern for the impact of one's own actions on others and their impressions.

His video for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\" won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Music Video, Short Form]], and a record seven awards at [[1998 MTV Video Music Awards]], including the [[MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year|Video of the Year]].\n\nIn 2008 he won another Grammy Award, this time around for \"Best Long Form Music Video\" for another work with Madonna \u2013 directing \"The Confessions Tour\" DVD. In 2014 he won this Grammy Award again (that meanwhile changed the name to \"Best Music Film\"), this time for \"Live Kisses\" [[Paul McCartney]] concert film. Jonas \u00c5kerlund, [[David Mallet (director)|David Mallet]] and Bob Smeaton are the only directors to have won this award twice sharing the record for most wins in this category (check here all winners and nominees of [[Grammy Award for Best Music Film]]).\n\n==Career==\n\u00c5kerlund was a member of the Swedish [[black metal]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] from 1983 to 1984. He also directed Candlemass' first video \"Bewitched\". He first found fame as the main video director for [[Roxette]]. In 1997, he directed the acclaimed video for [[The Prodigy]]'s \"[[Smack My Bitch Up]]\", which sparked controversy due to its depiction of drug use, violence, and nudity. In 1998, he worked with [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] for the song \"[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]\", and has since worked with acts such as [[Metallica]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[U2]], [[Blink-182]], [[P!nk]], [[Rammstein]], [[Britney Spears]], and [[Lady Gaga]]. He directed the music video for the [[Smashing Pumpkins]]' \"Try, Try, Try\", from which a short film entitled ''Try'' was spawned. He was also the designer and photographer for the [[Roxette]] album ''[[Room Service (Roxette album)|Room Service]]'' in 2001. In 2002, his first full-length film, ''[[Spun]]'', debuted.\n\n\u00c5kerlund directed commercials for Swedish clothing retailer MQ and the re-imagining of the Devo song \"Watch Us Work It\" used in [[Dell Computers]] commercials. He is a long-time collaborator of Madonna, having worked on such music videos as \"Music\", \"American Life\" (which was pulled due to its graphic content and the [[Iraq War]]), and \"Jump\". He also directed her documentary film ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'' and her concert special ''[[The Confessions Tour (album)|The Confessions Tour: Live from London]]''. Among his more recent works were the controversial pornographic music video for [[Rammstein]]'s \"[[Pussy (Rammstein song)|Pussy]]\", the video for the song \"[[Telephone (song)|Telephone]]\" by [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Beyonc\u00e9]], \"[[Moves like Jagger]]\" by [[Maroon 5]] and [[Christina Aguilera]], and [[Duran Duran]]'s single \"Girl Panic!\".<ref name=\"MTV gaga\">{{cite

R\u00e2\u0219nov was mentioned for the first time in 1331 as ''Rosnou'' and again in 1388 as ''villa Rosarum''.<ref>http://www.siebenbuerger.de/ortschaften/rosenau/informationen/</ref> While the village was razed many times in its history by [[Tatars]], [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Vlachs|Wallachians]], the castle was conquered only once, in 1612 by [[Gabriel B\u00e1thory]].\n\nIn 2002, the R\u00e2\u0219nov Fortress and surroundings were used during the shooting of several scenes from the American film ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]''.\n\n==Myth==\nThere is a myth attached to [[R\u00e2\u0219nov Citadel]]. During a particularly long siege of the fortress, the citizens of R\u00e2\u0219nov were concerned about the lack of available fresh drinking water.  Two Turkish soldiers, having been captured earlier, were put to the task of digging a well in the centre of the fortress.  These two men were assured that they would be given their freedom once the well was completed.  According to local legend, it took them 17 years to finish the well, but they were still killed afterwards.

Two Turkish soldiers, having been captured earlier, were put to the task of digging a well in the centre of the fortress.  These two men were assured that they would be given their freedom once the well was completed.  According to local legend, it took them 17 years to finish the well, but they were still killed afterwards.

It was released on 27 March 2020 by [[Warner Records]], after leaking in its entirety two weeks before its original release date, 3 April 2020. Commencing work on the album in early 2018, Lipa enlisted writers and producers such as [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]], [[Stuart Price]], [[The Monsters and the Strangerz]] and others, in order to create a \"nostalgic\" [[Pop music|pop]] and [[disco]] album with influences from [[dance-pop]] and [[electronic music]], inspired by artists such as [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Moloko]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[Outkast]].\n\nThe album was preceded by three singles and one promotional single. \"[[Don't Start Now (Dua Lipa song)|Don't Start Now]]\" was released on 1 November 2019, as the album's [[lead single]], attaining both critical and commercial success. The song became her first top three entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The [[Future Nostalgia (song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single on 13 December 2019. \"[[Physical (Dua Lipa song)|Physical]]\" and \"[[Break My Heart (Dua Lipa song)|Break My Heart]]\" were released as the second and third singles, respectively. To promote the album, Lipa announced the [[Future Nostalgia Tour]], commencing in January 2021.\n\nUpon its release, ''Future Nostalgia'' received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised its cohesiveness and production.\n\n== Background and production ==\nAfter the release of ''[[Dua Lipa: The Complete Edition]]'' in October 2018, the expanded deluxe edition of her debut album, Lipa announced a new single titled \"[[Swan Song (song)|Swan Song]]\". On 24 January 2019, the song was released for the film ''[[Alita: Battle Angel]]'' (2019), and was met with moderate commercial success. In the same month, Lipa stated that she had been spending the past year in the writing process for an upcoming second studio album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dua-lipa-grammys-music-2019-779203/|title=Dua Lipa's New Rules for 2019|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|date=16 January 2019|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> Whilst discussing the sound of the album, Lipa commented that it would be a \"nostalgic\" pop record that \"feels like a dancercise class\".<ref name=\"bbc1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-48880735|title=Dua Lipa reveals nerves about new album|last=Savage|first=Mark|date=5 July 2019|website=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 December 2019}}</ref> On the development of ''Future Nostalgia'', Lipa stated:\n<blockquote>\nWhat I wanted to do with this album was to break out of my comfort zone and challenge myself to make music that felt like it could sit alongside some of my favourite classic pop songs, whilst still feeling fresh and uniquely mine.

It was released on 27 March 2020 by [[Warner Records]], after leaking in its entirety two weeks before its original release date, 3 April 2020. Commencing work on the album in early 2018, Lipa enlisted writers and producers such as [[Jeff Bhasker]], [[Ian Kirkpatrick (record producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]], [[Stuart Price]], [[The Monsters and the Strangerz]] and others, in order to create a \"nostalgic\" [[Pop music|pop]] and [[disco]] album with influences from [[dance-pop]] and [[electronic music]], inspired by artists such as [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Moloko]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and [[Outkast]].\n\nThe album was preceded by three singles and one promotional single. \"[[Don't Start Now (Dua Lipa song)|Don't Start Now]]\" was released on 1 November 2019, as the album's [[lead single]], attaining both critical and commercial success. The song became her first top three entry on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The [[Future Nostalgia (song)|title track]] was released as a promotional single on 13 December 2019. \"[[Physical (Dua Lipa song)|Physical]]\" and \"[[Break My Heart (Dua Lipa song)|Break My Heart]]\" were released as the second and third singles, respectively. To promote the album, Lipa announced the [[Future Nostalgia Tour]], commencing in January 2021.\n\nUpon its release, ''Future Nostalgia'' received widespread acclaim from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised its cohesiveness and production.\n\n== Background and production ==\nAfter the release of ''[[Dua Lipa: The Complete Edition]]'' in October 2018, the expanded deluxe edition of her debut album, Lipa announced a new single titled \"[[Swan Song (song)|Swan Song]]\".

The squadron was twice awarded the [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] for its combat actions.  Following [[V-E Day]], it returned to the United States and was inactivated.  The squadron was briefly active in the [[military reserve force|reserve]] in the late 1940s, but does not appear to have been fully manned or equipped.\n\nThe squadron was redesignated the '''562d Fighter-Bomber Squadron''' and activated in 1953.  It moved to Europe, but was inactivated in 1957, when it was replaced by another unit.   It was activated again as the '''562d Tactical Fighter Squadron''' in 1962.  It conducted frequent deployments, but focused on training pilots for operations in Southeast Asia.  Elements of the squadron participated in combat there, although the squadron remained in the United States.  From 1973, it conducted [[Wild Weasel]] training.  It deployed elements for [[Desert Storm]] before inactivating in 1992.\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\n====Initial training and deployment====\nThe 562d was first activated as the '''562d Bombardment Squadron''' at [[Gowen Field]], Idaho, one of the four original [[squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] of the [[388th Bombardment Group]], in December 1942.<ref name=562FTSfacts/><ref name=Maurer388BG>Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp. 275-276</ref>  The [[cadre (military)|cadre]] that formed at Gowen moved to [[Wendover Field]], Utah in February 1943, where the unit was fully manned and squadron training with [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] heavy bombers began.  Training continued until June 1943, when it deployed to England.  The air echelon ferried its B-17s to England via the northern ferry route, while the ground echelon departed for [[Camp Kilmer]], New Jersey, the port of embarkation, sailing in the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} on 1 July.<ref name=Freeman255>Freeman, p. 255</ref> \n\n====Combat in Europe====\n[[File:B-17F \"Tom Paine\" of the 388th Bomb Group, WW2.jpg|thumb|left|388th Group B-17 in England<ref group=note>Aircraft is Boeing B-17F-120-BO Flying Fortress, serial 42-30793, \"Tom Paine\".</ref>]]\nThe squadron assembled at [[RAF Knettishall]], its combat station, and flew its first combat mission on 17 July, when it attacked an aircraft factory in [[Amsterdam]].  The squadron primarily engaged in the [[strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|strategic bombing campaign against Germany]], attacking industrial sites, oil [[refineries]] and storage facilities, communications centers and naval targets on the European Continent.<ref name=Maurer388BG/>\n\nThe squadron was awarded a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] (DUC) for attacking an aircraft factory at [[Regensburg]], Germany, on 17 August 1943, withstanding heavy resistance to reach the target.  It was awarded a second DUC for three separate missions: an earlier attack on a tire and rubber factory in [[Hanover]], Germany on 26 July 1943 and two missions in 1944, one against synthetic oil refineries near [[Br\u00fcx]], Germany<ref group=note>Now Most, Czech Republic.</ref> on 12 May and at [[Ruhland]], Germany on 21 June. This last attack was on a shuttle bombing mission from England to Germany to [[Poltava]], USSR,<ref group=note>Now in the Ukraine.</ref> to [[Foggia]], Italy, and back to England.<ref name=Maurer388BG/>  Other strategic targets included aircraft factories at [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], [[Kassel]], and [[Reims]]; [[airfield]]s at [[Paris]], [[Berlin]] and in [[Bordeaux]]; naval installations at [[Emden]], [[Kiel]] and [[La Pallice]], chemical works in [[Ludwigshafen]]; [[ball bearing]] factories at [[Schweinfurt]] and rail [[marshalling yards]] in [[Bielefeld]], [[Brussels]], and [[Osnabruck]].<ref name=Maurer388BG/>\n\nThe squadron was occasionally diverted from the strategic campaign to perform [[air support]] and [[interdiction]] missions.  It attacked military installations in France in early 1944 to help prepare the way for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Normandy, and on [[D Day]] hit [[coastal defence and fortification|coastal defenses]], [[artillery batteries]] and transportation targets.  It attacked troop concentrations and supply depots.  In July 1944, it supported [[Operation Cobra]] at [[Saint Lo]] and the following month attacked targets in [[Caen]].  It struck military installations and airfields near [[Arnhem]] during [[Operation Market Garden]], the unsuccessful attempt to secure a bridgehead across the [[Rhine]] in the Netherlands.  It attacked transportation targets to support the final drive through Germany in early 1045.<ref name=Maurer388BG/>\n\n====Return and inactivation====\nThe squadron flew its last combat mission to the [[Landsberg Air Base|Landsberg Airfield]] near [[Munich]], on 21 April 1945.  After [[V-E Day]], the squadron flew missions to the Netherlands to drop food in flooded areas.  It then began redeploying to the United States.  Its aircraft left Knettishall between 9 June and 5 July 1945.  The ground echelon sailed again on the ''Queen Elizabeth'' on 5 August.  The squadron inactivated at [[Sioux Falls Army Air Field]], South Dakota on 28 August 1945.<ref name=562FTSfacts/><ref name=Maurer388BG/><ref name=Freeman255/><ref name=\"562 FTS Fact Sheet\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.randolph.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=5904 |title=Randolph Air Force Base Fact Sheets\": 562nd Flying Training Squadron|publisher=12th Flying Training Wing Public Affairs |access-date=3 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614000851/http://www.randolph.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=5904 |archive-date=14 June 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Air reserve===\nThe squadron was activated in the [[military reserve force|reserves]] at [[Orchard Place Airport]], Illinois on 12 June 1947 and assigned to the [[338th Bombardment Group]].

However, construction at Etain was not far enough advanced to permit it to accept fighter aircraft, and only the wing [[headquarters]] settled in to the base.<ref name=Ravenstein388TFW>Ravenstein, pp. 209-211</ref><ref>McAuliffe, p. 283</ref>  Instead, the squadron ferried their Sabres to [[Spangdahlem Air Base]], Germany, arriving the following month.<ref name=562FTSfacts/><ref>McAuliffe, p. 287</ref>\n\nLittle flying was done in the squadron's first winter in Europe due to weather.  It deployed to [[Wheelus Air Base]], Libya in April 1955, where it was able to train in gunnery and bombing for the first time since arriving in Europe.  The squadron rejoined the wing at its permanent base in France in September 1955.  Starting in November 1955, it began deployments to Detachment 1 of the 388th Wing at [[Hahn Air Base]], Germany to stand nuclear [[alert status|alert]].  The detachment moved to Spangdahlem in February 1956.<ref>McAuliffe, pp. 288, 290-291</ref>\n\nIn August 1956, the squadron began training to convert to the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]].  The conversion was completed by May 1957.<ref>McAuliffe, pp. 291-292</ref>  However, the squadron flew the \"Hun\" for less than a year.  On 10 December 1957, the [[49th Fighter-Bomber Wing]] moved from Japan on paper to replace the 388th Wing,  The 562d was inactivated and its mission, personnel and aircraft transferred to the [[8th Fighter-Bomber Squadron]].<ref name=562FTSfacts/><ref>Ravenstein, p. 80</ref><ref>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 47-48</ref>\n\n===F-105 fighter operations===\n[[File:F-105d-562tfs-thai.jpg|thumb|F-105Ds of the 562nd Tactical Fighter Squadron, deployed from McConnell AFB to Thailand in 1965]]\nThe squadron was redesignated the '''562d Tactical Fighter Squadron''', organized at [[McConnell Air Force Base]], Kansas in October 1962 and assigned to the [[388th Tactical Fighter Wing]].  In February 1964, the 388th was replaced at McConnell by the [[23d Tactical Fighter Wing]].<ref>Ravenstein, pp. 44, 210</ref>  The 561st was equipped with the [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief]].  The squadron conducted tactical operations and training in preparation for global deployment.  In Auust 1965, the 562nd deployed to [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base]], Thailand.  For the next five months, it participated in sustained combat operations in the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"562 FTS Fact Sheet\"/>  In November, the [[355th Tactical Fighter Wing]] replaced the [[6235th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at Takhli and the Air Force began to station permanent fighter squadrons there.  The squadron returned to McConnell in December, but earned an [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]] with [[Combat \"V\" Device]] during its combat tour in Thailand.<ref name=562FTSfacts/><ref>Ravenstein, p. 44</ref>  \n\nIn January 1966, the squadron focused on training replacement F-105 pilots for units in Southeast Asia.  It continued this mission until August 1970, when the need for \"Thud Drivers\" diminished with the withdrawal of the United States from Southeast Asia.  The squadron continued to fly the F-105 until inactivated in September 1972.<ref name=562FTSfacts/> \n\n===Wild Weasel operations===\n[[File:F-4g-george-1989.jpg|thumb|35th Wing F-4G at George AFB in 1989]]\nThe squadron was again activated on 31 October 1974 at [[George Air Force Base]], California and assigned to the [[35th Tactical Fighter Wing]].  It was once again equipped with F-105s, but now with the two seat F-105G equipped for the [[Wild Weasel]] mission.  The squadron upgraded to [[McDonnell F-4G Phantom II]]s in 1980, and starting the following year trained [[electronic warfare officer]]s in the Wild Weasel mission.  It continued in this role until inactivating in June 1992.\n30 June 1992, the 562nd was stationed  to fly the F-105 and then the [[McDonnell F-4G Phantom II]] aircraft conducting [[Wild Weasel]] missions.

It was part of the [[12th Flying Training Wing]] at [[Randolph Air Force Base]], Texas, where it operated the [[Boeing T-43 Bobcat]] conducting navigator training from 1993 until inactivatting on 19 November 2010.\n\nThe squadron was originally activated during [[World War II]] as the '''562d Bombardment Squadron'''.  After training in the United States, it deployed to the [[European Theater of Operations]], where it participated in the [[strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|strategic bombing campaign against Germany]].  The squadron was twice awarded the [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] for its combat actions.  Following [[V-E Day]], it returned to the United States and was inactivated.  The squadron was briefly active in the [[military reserve force|reserve]] in the late 1940s, but does not appear to have been fully manned or equipped.\n\nThe squadron was redesignated the '''562d Fighter-Bomber Squadron''' and activated in 1953.  It moved to Europe, but was inactivated in 1957, when it was replaced by another unit.   It was activated again as the '''562d Tactical Fighter Squadron''' in 1962.  It conducted frequent deployments, but focused on training pilots for operations in Southeast Asia.  Elements of the squadron participated in combat there, although the squadron remained in the United States.  From 1973, it conducted [[Wild Weasel]] training.  It deployed elements for [[Desert Storm]] before inactivating in 1992.\n\n==History==\n===World War II===\n====Initial training and deployment====\nThe 562d was first activated as the '''562d Bombardment Squadron''' at [[Gowen Field]], Idaho, one of the four original [[squadron (aviation)|squadrons]] of the [[388th Bombardment Group]], in December 1942.<ref name=562FTSfacts/><ref name=Maurer388BG>Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp. 275-276</ref>  The [[cadre (military)|cadre]] that formed at Gowen moved to [[Wendover Field]], Utah in February 1943, where the unit was fully manned and squadron training with [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] heavy bombers began.  Training continued until June 1943, when it deployed to England.  The air echelon ferried its B-17s to England via the northern ferry route, while the ground echelon departed for [[Camp Kilmer]], New Jersey, the port of embarkation, sailing in the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} on 1 July.<ref name=Freeman255>Freeman, p. 255</ref> \n\n====Combat in Europe====\n[[File:B-17F \"Tom Paine\" of the 388th Bomb Group, WW2.jpg|thumb|left|388th Group B-17 in England<ref group=note>Aircraft is Boeing B-17F-120-BO Flying Fortress, serial 42-30793, \"Tom Paine\".</ref>]]\nThe squadron assembled at [[RAF Knettishall]], its combat station, and flew its first combat mission on 17 July, when it attacked an aircraft factory in [[Amsterdam]].  The squadron primarily engaged in the [[strategic bombing during World War II#US bombing in Europe|strategic bombing campaign against Germany]], attacking industrial sites, oil [[refineries]] and storage facilities, communications centers and naval targets on the European Continent.<ref name=Maurer388BG/>\n\nThe squadron was awarded a [[Distinguished Unit Citation]] (DUC) for attacking an aircraft factory at [[Regensburg]], Germany, on 17 August 1943, withstanding heavy resistance to reach the target.  It was awarded a second DUC for three separate missions: an earlier attack on a tire and rubber factory in [[Hanover]], Germany on 26 July 1943 and two missions in 1944, one against synthetic oil refineries near [[Br\u00fcx]], Germany<ref group=note>Now Most, Czech Republic.</ref> on 12 May and at [[Ruhland]], Germany on 21 June. This last attack was on a shuttle bombing mission from England to Germany to [[Poltava]], USSR,<ref group=note>Now in the Ukraine.</ref> to [[Foggia]], Italy, and back to England.<ref name=Maurer388BG/>  Other strategic targets included aircraft factories at [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]], [[Kassel]], and [[Reims]]; [[airfield]]s at [[Paris]], [[Berlin]] and in [[Bordeaux]]; naval installations at [[Emden]], [[Kiel]] and [[La Pallice]], chemical works in [[Ludwigshafen]]; [[ball bearing]] factories at [[Schweinfurt]] and rail [[marshalling yards]] in [[Bielefeld]], [[Brussels]], and [[Osnabruck]].<ref name=Maurer388BG/>\n\nThe squadron was occasionally diverted from the strategic campaign to perform [[air support]] and [[interdiction]] missions.  It attacked military installations in France in early 1944 to help prepare the way for [[Operation Overlord]], the invasion of Normandy, and on [[D Day]] hit [[coastal defence and fortification|coastal defenses]], [[artillery batteries]] and transportation targets.  It attacked troop concentrations and supply depots.  In July 1944, it supported [[Operation Cobra]] at [[Saint Lo]] and the following month attacked targets in [[Caen]].  It struck military installations and airfields near [[Arnhem]] during [[Operation Market Garden]], the unsuccessful attempt to secure a bridgehead across the [[Rhine]] in the Netherlands.  It attacked transportation targets to support the final drive through Germany in early 1045.<ref name=Maurer388BG/>\n\n====Return and inactivation====\nThe squadron flew its last combat mission to the [[Landsberg Air Base|Landsberg Airfield]] near [[Munich]], on 21 April 1945.  After [[V-E Day]], the squadron flew missions to the Netherlands to drop food in flooded areas.  It then began redeploying to the United States.  Its aircraft left Knettishall between 9 June and 5 July 1945.  The ground echelon sailed again on the ''Queen Elizabeth'' on 5 August.  The squadron inactivated at [[Sioux Falls Army Air Field]], South Dakota on 28 August 1945.<ref name=562FTSfacts/><ref name=Maurer388BG/><ref name=Freeman255/><ref name=\"562 FTS Fact Sheet\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.randolph.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=5904 |title=Randolph Air Force Base Fact Sheets\": 562nd Flying Training Squadron|publisher=12th Flying Training Wing Public Affairs |access-date=3 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614000851/http://www.randolph.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=5904 |archive-date=14 June 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Air reserve===\nThe squadron was activated in the [[military reserve force|reserves]] at [[Orchard Place Airport]], Illinois on 12 June 1947 and assigned to the [[338th Bombardment Group]].    The squadron trained under the supervision of [[Air Defense Command]] (ADC)'s 141st AAF Base Unit (Reserve Training) (later the 2471st Air Force Reserve Flying Training Center), although it does not appear that it was fully manned or equipped.<ref name=562FTSfacts/><ref name=Maurer338BG>Maurer, ''Combat Units'', pp. 217\u2013218</ref>  Although nominally a bombardment unit, the squadron was equipped with [[North American AT-6 Texan]] and [[Beechcraft AT-11 Kansan]] trainers.<ref name=562FTSfacts/>\n\nIn July 1948 [[Continental Air Command]] (ConAC) assumed responsibility for managing reserve and [[Air National Guard]] units from ADC.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.airforcehistoryindex.org/data/000/896/983.xml |last1=|first1=|title=Abstract, Mission Project Closeup, Continental Air Command|date=27 December 1961|publisher=Air Force History Index|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}</ref>  In 1949, the 562nd began to fly a few [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]] and [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain]] troop carriers and [[Douglas B-26 Invader]] light bombers, but it was inactivated in June when ConAC reorganized its reserve units under the [[Hobson Plan|wing base organization]] system.

However, construction at Etain was not far enough advanced to permit it to accept fighter aircraft, and only the wing [[headquarters]] settled in to the base.<ref name=Ravenstein388TFW>Ravenstein, pp. 209-211</ref><ref>McAuliffe, p. 283</ref>  Instead, the squadron ferried their Sabres to [[Spangdahlem Air Base]], Germany, arriving the following month.<ref name=562FTSfacts/><ref>McAuliffe, p. 287</ref>\n\nLittle flying was done in the squadron's first winter in Europe due to weather.  It deployed to [[Wheelus Air Base]], Libya in April 1955, where it was able to train in gunnery and bombing for the first time since arriving in Europe.  The squadron rejoined the wing at its permanent base in France in September 1955.  Starting in November 1955, it began deployments to Detachment 1 of the 388th Wing at [[Hahn Air Base]], Germany to stand nuclear [[alert status|alert]].  The detachment moved to Spangdahlem in February 1956.<ref>McAuliffe, pp. 288, 290-291</ref>\n\nIn August 1956, the squadron began training to convert to the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]].  The conversion was completed by May 1957.<ref>McAuliffe, pp. 291-292</ref>  However, the squadron flew the \"Hun\" for less than a year.  On 10 December 1957, the [[49th Fighter-Bomber Wing]] moved from Japan on paper to replace the 388th Wing,  The 562d was inactivated and its mission, personnel and aircraft transferred to the [[8th Fighter-Bomber Squadron]].<ref name=562FTSfacts/><ref>Ravenstein, p. 80</ref><ref>Maurer, ''Combat Squadrons'', pp. 47-48</ref>\n\n===F-105 fighter operations===\n[[File:F-105d-562tfs-thai.jpg|thumb|F-105Ds of the 562nd Tactical Fighter Squadron, deployed from McConnell AFB to Thailand in 1965]]\nThe squadron was redesignated the '''562d Tactical Fighter Squadron''', organized at [[McConnell Air Force Base]], Kansas in October 1962 and assigned to the [[388th Tactical Fighter Wing]].  In February 1964, the 388th was replaced at McConnell by the [[23d Tactical Fighter Wing]].<ref>Ravenstein, pp. 44, 210</ref>  The 561st was equipped with the [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief]].  The squadron conducted tactical operations and training in preparation for global deployment.  In Auust 1965, the 562nd deployed to [[Takhli Royal Thai Air Force Base]], Thailand.  For the next five months, it participated in sustained combat operations in the [[Vietnam War]].<ref name=\"562 FTS Fact Sheet\"/>  In November, the [[355th Tactical Fighter Wing]] replaced the [[6235th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at Takhli and the Air Force began to station permanent fighter squadrons there.  The squadron returned to McConnell in December, but earned an [[Air Force Outstanding Unit Award]] with [[Combat \"V\" Device]] during its combat tour in Thailand.<ref name=562FTSfacts/><ref>Ravenstein, p. 44</ref>  \n\nIn January 1966, the squadron focused on training replacement F-105 pilots for units in Southeast Asia.  It continued this mission until August 1970, when the need for \"Thud Drivers\" diminished with the withdrawal of the United States from Southeast Asia.  The squadron continued to fly the F-105 until inactivated in September 1972.<ref name=562FTSfacts/> \n\n===Wild Weasel operations===\n[[File:F-4g-george-1989.jpg|thumb|35th Wing F-4G at George AFB in 1989]]\nThe squadron was again activated on 31 October 1974 at [[George Air Force Base]], California and assigned to to the [[35th Tactical Fighter Wing]].  It was once again equipped with F-105s, but now with the two seat F-105G equipped for the [[Wild Weasel]] mission.  The squadron upgraded to [[McDonnell F-4G Phantom II]]s in 1980, and starting the following year trained [[electronic warfare officer]]s in the Wild Weasel mission.  It continued in this role until inactivating in June 1992.\n30 June 1992, the 562nd was stationed  to fly the F-105 and then the [[McDonnell F-4G Phantom II]] aircraft conducting [[Wild Weasel]] missions.
