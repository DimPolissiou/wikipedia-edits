The American Association folded after that season, and the team was purchased by [[J. Earl Wagner]], who would own the team for the remainder of its existence.

In fact the Original Senators were the first of three teams, all called the Washington Senators, and were in the Capital continuously until the third Senators franchise left to become the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]]. The second had left the city in 1960 becoming the [[Minnesota Twins]] and were followed immediately by a new expansion team of the same name, ultimately leaving for Texas in 1971. Baseball returned to the Capital in 2005 when the [[Montreal Expos]] became the [[Washington Nationals]]. The \"Washington Senators\" name was still owned by the Texas Rangers, so organizers sought other options. Washington, D.C., mayor [[Anthony A. Williams]] supported the name \"Washington Grays,\" in honor of the Negro-league team the [[Homestead Grays]] (1929\u20131950), which had been based in [[Pittsburgh]], but played many of their home games in Washington.

During this time, [[Islam]] was introduced to the population. The [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] was an area much larger than today's Kosovo; it included all today's Kosovo territory, sections of the [[Sand\u017eak]] region cutting into present-day [[\u0160umadija and Western Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] along with the [[Kuk\u00ebs]] municipality, the surrounding region in present-day northern [[Albania]] and also parts of north-western North Macedonia with the city of [[Skopje]] (then \u00dcsk\u00fcp), as its capital. Between 1881 and 1912 (its final phase), it was internally expanded to include other regions of present-day North Macedonia, including larger urban settlements such as [[\u0160tip]] (''\u0130\u015ftip''), [[Kumanovo]] (''Kumanova'') and [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]] (''Kratova'').

The scholar Fredrick F. Anscombe shows that Prizren and [[Vu\u010ditrn]] (''Vul\u00e7itrin'') had no Serbian population in early 17th century. Prizren was inhabited by a mix of Catholic and Muslim Albanians, while Vu\u010ditrn had a mix of Albanian and Turkish speakers, followed by tiny a Serbian minority. [[Gjakova]] was founded by Albanians in the 16th century, and [[Pe\u0107]] (''\u0130pek'') had a continuous presence of the Albanian Kelmendi tribe. Central Kosovo was mixed, but large parts of the [[Drenica|Drenica Valley]] were ethnically Albanian.

[[Language policy]] was of utmost importance in communist Yugoslavia, which after World War II was reorganized as a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation of ethnolinguistically defined nations]], in emulation of the [[Korenizatsiya|interwar Soviet nationalities policy]]. For instance, in 1944, the [[Macedonian language]] was proclaimed for the sake of distancing former [[Vardar Banovina]], which was [[World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia|incorporated into wartime Bulgaria]], from [[Bulgarian language]] and culture. Likewise, in postwar Yugoslavia's [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], the local [[Albanian language]] was distanced from Albania's standard steeped in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], by basing it on the Kosovar dialect of [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]. As a result, a standard Kosovar language was formed. However, after the rapprochement between Albania and Yugoslavia at the turn of the 1970s, Belgrade adopted Albania's Tosk-based standard of the Albanian language, which ended the brief flourishing of the Gheg-based Kosovar language.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/29940833/The_Idea_of_a_Kosovan_Language_in_Yugoslavia_s_Language_Politics_pp_217-237_._International_Journal_of_the_Sociology_of_Language._Vol_242._DOI_10.1515_ijsl-2016-0040 Tomasz Kamusella. 2016.

As of the [[Constitution of Kosovo]], the judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest judicial authority, a [[Constitutional Court of Kosovo|Constitutional Court]], and an independent prosecutorial institution. All of them are administered by the [[Kosovo Judicial Council|Judicial Council]] located in [[Pristina]]. The [[Kosovo Police]] is the main state law enforcement agency in the nation. After the Independence of Kosovo in 2008, the force became the governmental agency. The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.\n\nThe [[Ahtisaari Plan]] envisaged two forms of international supervision of Kosovo after its independence such as the [[International Civilian Office]] (ICO), which would monitor the implementation of the Plan and would have a wide range of veto powers over legislative and executive actions, and the [[EULEX|European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo]] (EULEX), which would have the narrower mission of deploying police and civilian resources with the aim of developing the Kosovo Police and judicial systems but also with its own powers of arrest and prosecution.\nThe declaration of independence and subsequent Constitution granted these bodies the powers assigned to them by the Ahtisaari Plan. Since the Plan was not voted on by the UN Security Council, the ICO's legal status within Kosovo was dependent on the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation; it was supervised by an [[International Steering Group]] (ISG) composed of the main states which recognised Kosovo. It was never recognised by Serbia or other non-recognising states. EULEX was also initially opposed by Serbia, but its mandate and powers were accepted in late 2008 by Serbia and the UN Security Council as operating under the umbrella of the continuing UNMIK mandate, in a status-neutral way, but with its own operational independence. The ICO's existence terminated on 10 September 2012, after the ISG had determined that Kosovo had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the Ahtisaari Plan. EULEX continues its existence under both Kosovo and international law; in 2012 the Kosovo president formally requested a continuation of its mandate until 2014.\n{{Clear}}\n=== Minorities ===\n\nThe relations between [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanians]] and [[Kosovo Serbs|Kosovar Serbs]] have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Schabnel, Albrecht 2001.

The scholar Fredrick F. Anscombe shows that Prizren and [[Vu\u010ditrn]] (''Vul\u00e7itrin'') had no Serbian population in early 17th century. Prizren was inhabited by a mix of Catholic and Muslim Albanians, while Vu\u010ditrn had a mix of Albanian and Turkish speakers, followed by tiny a Serbian minority. [[Gjakova]] was founded by Albanians in the 16th century, and [[Pe\u0107]] (''\u0130pek'') had a continuous presence of the Albanian Kelmendi tribe. Central Kosovo was mixed, but large parts of the [[Drenica|Drenica Valley]] were ethnically Albanian.

[[Language policy]] was of utmost importance in communist Yugoslavia, which after World War II was reorganized as a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation of ethnolinguistically defined nations]], in emulation of the [[Korenizatsiya|interwar Soviet nationalities policy]]. For instance, in 1944, the [[Macedonian language]] was proclaimed for the sake of distancing former [[Vardar Banovina]], which was [[World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia|incorporated into wartime Bulgaria]], from [[Bulgarian language]] and culture. Likewise, in postwar Yugoslavia's [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], the local [[Albanian language]] was distanced from Albania's standard steeped in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], by basing it on the Kosovar dialect of [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]. As a result, a standard Kosovar language was formed. However, after the rapprochement between Albania and Yugoslavia at the turn of the 1970s, Belgrade adopted Albania's Tosk-based standard of the Albanian language, which ended the brief flourishing of the Gheg-based Kosovar language.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/29940833/The_Idea_of_a_Kosovan_Language_in_Yugoslavia_s_Language_Politics_pp_217-237_._International_Journal_of_the_Sociology_of_Language._Vol_242._DOI_10.1515_ijsl-2016-0040 Tomasz Kamusella. 2016.

The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.\n\nThe [[Ahtisaari Plan]] envisaged two forms of international supervision of Kosovo after its independence such as the [[International Civilian Office]] (ICO), which would monitor the implementation of the Plan and would have a wide range of veto powers over legislative and executive actions, and the [[EULEX|European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo]] (EULEX), which would have the narrower mission of deploying police and civilian resources with the aim of developing the Kosovo Police and judicial systems but also with its own powers of arrest and prosecution.\nThe declaration of independence and subsequent Constitution granted these bodies the powers assigned to them by the Ahtisaari Plan. Since the Plan was not voted on by the UN Security Council, the ICO's legal status within Kosovo was dependent on the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation; it was supervised by an [[International Steering Group]] (ISG) composed of the main states which recognised Kosovo. It was never recognised by Serbia or other non-recognising states. EULEX was also initially opposed by Serbia, but its mandate and powers were accepted in late 2008 by Serbia and the UN Security Council as operating under the umbrella of the continuing UNMIK mandate, in a status-neutral way, but with its own operational independence. The ICO's existence terminated on 10 September 2012, after the ISG had determined that Kosovo had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the Ahtisaari Plan. EULEX continues its existence under both Kosovo and international law; in 2012 the Kosovo president formally requested a continuation of its mandate until 2014.\n{{Clear}}\n=== Minorities ===\n\nThe relations between [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanians]] and [[Kosovo Serbs|Kosovar Serbs]] have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Schabnel, Albrecht 2001.

Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved. Kosovafilm was reestablished after [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] withdrawal from the region in June 1999 and has since been endeavoring to revive the film industry in Kosovo.\n\n[[File:Odissea Bekim Fehmiu.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bekim Fehmiu]] was the first Eastern European actor to star in [[Hollywood]] during the Cold War.]]\n\nThe International [[Dokufest|Documentary and Short Film Festival]] is the largest film event in Kosovo.

The term may also be applied to methods for catching other [[aquatic animal]]s such as [[mollusc]]s ([[shellfish]], [[squid]], [[octopus]]) and edible marine [[invertebrate]]s.\n\n[[Fishing]] techniques include [[Gathering seafood by hand|hand-gathering]], [[spearfishing]], [[Fish net|netting]], [[angling]] and [[Fish trap|trapping]]. [[Recreational fishing|Recreational]], [[Commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[Artisan fishing|artisanal]] fishers use different techniques, and also, sometimes, the same techniques. Recreational fishers fish for pleasure or sport, while commercial fishers fish for profit. Artisanal fishers use traditional, low-tech methods, for survival in [[developing countries]], and as a cultural heritage in other countries. Mostly, recreational fishers use angling methods and commercial fishers use netting methods.\n\nThere is an intricate link between various fishing techniques and knowledge about the fish and their behaviour including [[Fish migration|migration]], [[Forage fish|foraging]] and [[Marine biology#Oceanic habitats|habitat]]. The effective use of fishing techniques often depends on this additional knowledge.<ref>Keegan, William F (1986) [https://web.archive.org/web/20080703210618/http://www.arqueologiamendoza.com/wikisrc/images/b/b5/The_Optimal_Foraging_Analysis_of_Horticultural_Production.pdf ''The Optimal Foraging Analysis of Horticultural Production''] American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 88, No. 1., pp. 92-107.</ref> Which techniques are appropriate is dictated mainly by the target species and by its habitat.<ref>F.T.D.

Fishing tackle refers to the physical equipment that is used when fishing, whereas fishing techniques refers to the manner in which the tackle is used when fishing.\n\n==Hand-gathering==\n{{see also|Gathering seafood by hand}}\nIt is possible to harvest many sea foods with minimal equipment by using the hands. Gathering [[seafood]] by hand can be as easy as picking [[shellfish]] or [[kelp]] up off the [[beach]], or doing some digging for [[clam]]s or [[crab]]s. The earliest evidence for shellfish gathering dates back to a 300,000-year-old site in France called [[Terra Amata (archaeological site)|Terra Amata]]. This is a [[hominid]] site as [[Anatomically modern human|modern ''Homo sapiens'']] did not appear in Europe until around 50,000 years ago.<ref>Szabo</ref><ref>Szabo, Katherine [http://www.manandmollusc.net/history_food.html ''Prehistoric Shellfish gathering.'']</ref>\n\n[[File:Ama2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ama diver]] in Japan]]\n* [[Flounder tramping]] - Every August, the small [[Scotland|Scottish]] village of [[Palnackie]] hosts the world flounder tramping championships where flounder are captured by stepping on them.\n* [[Noodling]]: Practiced in the United States, mostly in the [[Southern United States|South]].

Gigging is popular in the [[Southern United States|American South]] and [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]].\n* [[Hawaiian sling]]s - have a sling separate from the spear, in the manner of an underwater bow and arrow.\n* [[Harpoon]]s - Spearfishing with barbed poles was widespread in [[palaeolithic]] times.<ref>Guthrie, Dale Guthrie (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3u6JNwMyMCEC&pg=PA298 ''The Nature of Paleolithic Art.''] Page 298.

With practice, divers are able to hold their breath for up to four minutes and sometimes longer. Of course, a diver with [[Scuba set|underwater breathing equipment]] can dive for much longer periods.\n* [[Trident]]s - are three-pronged spears. They are also called leisters or gigs. They are used for spear fishing and were formerly also a military weapon. They feature widely in early mythology and history.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Netting==\n{{Main|Fishing net}}\n\nFishing nets are [[mesh]]es usually formed by knotting a relatively thin thread. About 180 AD the Greek author [[Oppian]] wrote the ''Halieutica'', a didactic poem about fishing. He described various means of fishing including the use of nets cast from boats, scoop nets held open by a hoop, and various traps \"which work while their masters sleep\".\n\nNetting is the principal method of commercial fishing, though [[Longline fishing|longlining]], [[Troll (angling)|trolling]], [[Fishing dredge|dredging]] and [[Fish trap|traps]] are also used.\n\n[[File:Kerala fisherman.jpg|thumb|right|A fisherman casting a net in [[Kerala]], India]]\n[[File:Eilif Peterssen-Laksefiskeren (1889).jpg|thumb|right|Oil painting of gillnetting, ''The salmon fisher'' by Eilif Peterssen]]\n[[File:Fishing, C\u00e0 Mau.jpg|thumb|right|Fishing with nets in [[C\u00e0 Mau Province]], [[Vietnam]]]]\n\n* '''Artisanal techniques'''\n** [[Chinese fishing nets]] - are shore operated lift nets.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/geartype?fid=255 Shore operated stationary lift nets]</ref> Huge mechanical contrivances hold out horizontal nets with diameters of twenty metres or more. The nets are dipped into the water and raised again, but otherwise cannot be moved.\n** [[Lampuki netting|Lampuki nets]] - are an example of a traditional [[Artisan fishing|artisanal]] use of nets. Since [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], [[Malta|Maltese]] fishers have cut the larger, lower [[frond]]s from [[palm tree]]s which they then weave into large flat rafts. The rafts are pulled out to sea by a [[luzzu]], a small traditional [[fishing vessel|fishing boat]]. In the middle of the day, lampuki fish (the Maltese name for [[mahi-mahi]]) school underneath the rafts, seeking the shade, and are caught by the fishers using large mesh nets.\n* [[Cast net]]s - are round nets with small [[Fishing sinker|weights]] distributed around the edge. They are also called ''throw nets.'' The net is [[Casting (fishing)|caste]] or thrown by hand in such a manner that it spreads out on the water and sinks. Fish are caught as the net is hauled back in.<ref name=\"Dunbar\">Dunbar, Jeffery A (2001) [http://www.nccoastalfishing.com/index.htm?casting.htm~main ''Casting net''] NC Coastal fishing. Retrieved 25 August 2008.</ref> This simple device has been in use, with various modifications, for thousands of years.\n* [[Drift net]]s - are nets which are not anchored. They are usually gillnets, and are commonly used in the coastal waters of many countries. Their use on the [[high seas]] is prohibited, but still occurs.\n* [[Ghost net]]s -  are nets that have been lost at sea. They can be a menace to marine life for many years.\n* [[Gillnet]]s - catch fish which try to pass through by snagging on the gill covers. Trapped, the fish can neither advance through the net nor retreat.\n* [[Haaf net fishing|Haaf nets]] - mainly used in the [[Solway Firth]] forming part of the border between [[England]] and [[Scotland]]. Brought to [[Great Britain]] by the [[Vikings]] a thousand years ago, the technique involves the fisherman wading out to deep waters with a large rectangular net and waiting for [[salmon]] to swim into it. The fish is then scooped up by the raising of the net.\n* [[Hand net]]s - are small nets held open by a hoop. They have been used since antiquity. They are also called scoop nets, and are used for scooping up fish near the surface of the water. They may or may not have a handle\u2013if they have a long handle they are called ''dip nets''. When used by anglers to help land fish they are called ''landing nets''.<ref name=\"Fishing Tools - Landing Nets\">[http://www.abc-of-fishing.net/fishing-tools/landing-net.asp Fishing Tools - Landing Nets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915101844/http://www.abc-of-fishing.net/fishing-tools/landing-net.asp |date=2008-09-15 }}</ref> Because hand netting is not destructive to fish, hand nets are used for [[tag and release]], or capturing [[aquarium fish]].\n* [[Seine fishing|Seine nets]] - are large fishing nets that can be arranged in different ways. In [[purse seining]] fishing the net hangs vertically in the water by attaching weights along the bottom edge and floats along the top. [[Seine fishing#Danish seine|Danish seining]] is a method which has some similarities with [[trawling]]. A simple and commonly used fishing technique is beach seining, where the seine net is operated from the shore.\n* [[Surrounding net]]s -\n* [[Tangle net]]s - also known as ''tooth nets'', are similar to gillnets except they have a smaller mesh size designed to catch fish by the teeth or upper jaw bone instead of by the gills.<ref>[http://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/commercial/selective/methods.html Selective Fishing Methods] '' Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife''. Retrieved 13 November 2011.</ref>\n* [[Trawling|Trawl nets]] - are large nets, conical in shape, designed to be towed in the sea or along the sea bottom. The trawl is pulled through the water by one or more boats, called [[Commercial trawler|trawlers]]. The activity of pulling the trawl through the water is called trawling.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Angling==\n{{main|Angling}}\n[[File:Trolling for bluefish2.jpg|thumb|right|\"Trolling for blue fish\" [[lithograph]] by [[Currier & Ives]], 1866]]\n[[File:Jigging off Queenscliff Pier, Vic, jjron 5.12.2009.jpg|thumb|right|Fishermen using [[jiggerpole]]s for [[jigging]] from the [[Queenscliff, Victoria|Queenscliff]] pier]]\n'''Angling''' is a method of fishing by means of an \"angle\" ([[Fish hook|hook]]). The hook is usually attached to a [[fishing line|line]], and is sometimes weighed down by a [[fishing sinker|sinker]] so it sinks in the water. This is the classic \"hook, line and sinker\" arrangement, used in angling since prehistoric times. The hook is usually [[Fishing bait|baited]] with [[Fishing lure|lures]] or [[bait fish]].\n\nAdditional arrangements include the use of a [[fishing rod]], which can be fitted with a [[Fishing reel|reel]], and functions as a delivery mechanism for [[Casting (fishing)|casting]] the line. Other delivery methods for projecting the line include fishing kites and cannons, kontiki rafts and remote controlled devices. [[Float (fishing)|Float]]s can also be used to help set the line or function as [[bite indicator]]s.  The hook can be dressed with [[fishing lure|lure]]s or [[Fishing bait|bait]]. Angling is the principal method of [[sport fishing]], but [[Commercial fishing|commercial fisheries]] also use angling methods involving multiple hooks, such as [[Longline fishing|longlining]] or commercial [[Troll (angling)|trolling]].\n\n===Line fishing===\nLine fishing is fishing with a [[fishing line]]. A fishing line is any cord made for fishing. Important parameters of a fishing line are its length, material, and weight (thicker, sturdier lines are more visible to fish). Factors that may determine what line an angler chooses for a given fishing environment include breaking [[strength of materials|strength]], knot strength, UV resistance, castability, limpness, stretch, abrasion resistance, and visibility.\n\nModern fishing lines are usually made from artificial substances. The most common type is ''[[monofilament line|monofilament]]'', made of a single strand. There are also ''[[braided fishing line]]s'' and thermally fused [[Multifilament fishing line|''superlines'']].\n\n* [[Dropline|Droplining]] - a dropline consists of a long [[fishing line]] set vertically down into the water, with a series of [[Fish bait|baited]] [[Fishing hook|hooks]] Droplines have a [[Fishing sinker|weight]] at the bottom and a [[Fishing float|float]] at the top. They are not usually as long as longlines and have fewer hooks.\n* [[Handline fishing|Handlining]] - is fishing with a single fishing line, baited with [[Fishing lure|lures]] or [[bait fish]], which is held in the hands. Handlining can be done from boats or from the shore. It is used mainly to catch [[groundfish]] and [[squid]], but smaller [[pelagic fish]] can also be caught.\n* [[Jiggerpole]] -\n* [[Jigging]] - is the practice of fishing with a jig, a type of fishing lure. A jig consists of a lead sinker with a hook molded into it and usually covered by a soft body to attract fish. Jigs are intended to create a jerky, vertical motion, as opposed to spinnerbaits which move through the water horizontally.\n* [[Longline fishing|Longlining]] - is a commercial technique that uses a long heavy fishing line with a series of hundreds or even thousands of [[Fish bait|baited]] [[Fishing hook|hooks]] hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called \"snoods\". Longlines are usually operated from specialised boats called longliners. They use a special winch to haul in the line, and can operate in deeper waters targeting [[pelagic]] species such as [[swordfish]], [[tuna]], [[halibut]] and [[sablefish]].\n[[File:Slabbing jig fishing lure.jpg|thumb|right|Slab]]\n* Slabbing: is a [[bass fishing]] technique, that involves repetitively lifting and dropping a flat lure, usually made of 1 to 2.5 oz of lead painted to look like a [[baitfish]] (or heavy slabs of metal), through a [[Swarm|school]] of actively feeding fish that the angler has located on a [[fishfinder]]. Used on [[white bass|white]] and [[striped bass]] in the reservoirs of the southern USA.\n* [[Trolling (fishing)|Trolling]] - is fishing with one or more baited lines which are drawn through the water. This may be done by pulling the line behind a slow moving boat, or by slowly winding the line in when fishing from the land. Trolling is used to catch pelagic fish such as [[mackerel]] and [[King mackerel|kingfish]].\n{{externalimage\n|align=right\n|width=180px\n|image1=[http://www.afma.gov.au/information/students/methods/pelagic.htm Pelagic longline]\n|image2=[http://www.afma.gov.au/information/students/methods/droplines.htm Dropline]\n|image3=[http://www.whiskerkitty.com/images/TrotlineDraw.jpg Trotline for catfish]\n}}\n* [[Trotline|Trotlining]] - a trotline is like a dropline, except that a dropline has a series of hooks suspended vertically in the water, while a trotline has a series of hooks suspended horizontally in the water. Trotlines can be physically set in many ways, such as tying each end to something fixed, and adjusting the set of the rest of the line with [[Fishing sinker|weights]] and [[Fishing float|floats]]. They are used for catching crabs or fish, such as catfish, particularly across rivers.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Angling with a rod===\n[[File:Fishing off pier.jpg|thumb|right|Angling with a rod.]]\n[[File:MuriwaiExtremeFishing3b.jpg|thumb|right|Extreme rock fishing off [[Muriwai|Muriwai Beach]], New Zealand]]\n[[File:Float-tube-pikeangler.jpg|right|thumb|An angler in his float tube plays a hooked pike.]]\n[[Fishing rod]]s give more control of the fishing line. The rod is usually fitted with a [[fishing reel]] which functions as a mechanism for storing, retrieving and paying out the line. [[Float (fishing)|Float]]s may also be used, and can function as [[bite indicator]]s. The hook can be dressed with [[fishing lure|lure]]s or [[Fishing bait|bait]].\n* [[Bank fishing]] - fishing from [[river bank]]s and similar shorelines. Bank fishing is usually performed with a fishing rod and reel, although nets, traps, and spears can also be used. People who fish from a boat can sometimes access more areas in prime locations with greater ease than bank fishermen. However many people don't own boats and find fishing from the bank has its own advantages. Bank fishing has its own requirements, and many things come into play for success, such as local knowledge, water depth, bank structure, location, time of day, and the type of bait and lures.\n* [[Casting (fishing)|Casting]] - the act of throwing the fishing line out over the water using a flexible fishing rod. The usual technique is for the angler to quickly flick the rod from behind toward the water.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fly Fishing Saltwater Basics: Saltwater Basics|author=C. Boyd Pfeiffer|year= 1999|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=0-8117-2763-7}}</ref> Casting is also a sport adjunct to [[fishing]], much as [[shooting]] is to [[hunting]]. The sport is supervised by the International Casting Sport Federation, which sponsors tournaments and recognizes world records for accuracy and distance. Some variations of the technique exist, such as [[Surf fishing]], the [[Reach cast]], and [[Spey casting]].\n* [[Float tube]]s - small doughnut-shaped boats with an underwater seat in the \"hole\". Float tubes are used for fly fishing and enable the angler to reach deeper water without splashing and disturbing stillwater fish.\n* [[Fly fishing]] - the use of [[Artificial fly|artificial flies]] as lures. These are cast with specially constructed [[fishing rod|fly rod]]s and fly lines. The fly line (today, almost always coated with plastic) is heavy enough cast in order to send the fly to the target. Artificial flies vary dramatically in size, weight and colour. Fly fishing is a distinct and ancient angling method, most renowned as a method for catching [[trout]] and [[salmon]], but employed today for a wide variety of species including [[Esox|pike]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], [[panfish]], and [[carp]], as well as [[ocean|marine]] species, such as [[Red drum|redfish]], [[Common snook|snook]], [[tarpon]], [[bonefish]] and [[striped bass]]. There is a growing population of anglers whose aim is to catch as many different species as possible with the fly.\n* [[Tenkara fishing]] - Tenkara is a form of fly fishing that originated in Japan over 200 years ago. It was originally done with a bamboo pole between 12' and 20' with the line tied directly on the tip of the rod requiring no reel. Modern tenkara rods are usually made of graphite and are telescopic. Unlike western style fly fishing tenkara uses either a tapered line or a level line and forgoes the PVC coated fly fishing line. Typical target species include [[trout]] and [[char]] but most smaller freshwater species can be caught by this method.\n* [[Rock fishing]] - fishing from rocky outcrops into the sea. It is a popular pastime in Australia and New Zealand. It can be a dangerous pastime and claims many lives each year.\n*Pitch Fishing - also known as \u201cpitching\u201d or \u201cpitch fishing,\u201d is a technique designed to deliver the lure quietly and at a lesser distance over the water. A normal, overhand cast with the tip up causes the lure to fly higher and farther out over the water, landing in a loud splash. Pitch fishing involves sending the lure out a lower angle, and thus making a smaller splash, allowing the bait to slip into the water nearby to not scare the fish. This cast technique is achieved better with a tabiki rod.<ref>{{cite web | title=pitch fishing | year=2013 | author=j.WALKER Network | publisher=www.theoutdooractivity.com | url=http://www.theoutdooractivity.com/flip-pitch-bass-fishing-lures/ | accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref>\n* [[Surf fishing|Surfcasting]] - fishing from a [[shoreline]] using a rod to cast into the [[Ocean surface wave|surf]].  With few exceptions, surf fishing is done in [[Seawater|saltwater]], often from a [[beach]]. The basic idea of most surfcasting is to cast a [[Fishing bait|bait]] or [[Fishing lure|lure]] as far out into the water as is necessary to reach the target fish from the shore. This may or may not require long casting distances and muscular techniques. Basic surf fishing can be done with a [[Fishing rod#Surf rods|surfcasting rod]] between seven and twelve feet long, with an extended butt section, equipped with an appropriate spinning or conventional casting [[Fishing reel|reel]]. Dedicated surfcasters usually possess an array of terminal and other tackle, with rods and reels of different lengths and actions, and lures and baits of different weights and capabilities. Depending on fishing conditions and the fish they are targeting, such surfcasters tailor bait and terminal tackle to rod and reel and the size and species of the fish. Reels and other equipment need to be constructed so they resist the corrosive and abrasive effects of salt and sand.\n\n===Other angling===\n* [[Bottom fishing]] - is fishing the bottom of a body of water. In the United Kingdom it is called \"ledgering\". A common rig for fishing on the bottom is a weight tied to the end of the line, with a hook about an inch up line from the weight. The method can be used both with hand lines and rods. There are fishing rods specialized for bottom fishing, called \"donkas\". The weight is used to cast or throw the line an appropriate distance. Bottom fishing can be done both from boats and from the land. It targets [[groundfish]] such as [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]], [[bream]], [[catfish]], and [[crappie]].\n* [[Ice fishing]] - is the practice of catching fish with lines and hooks through an opening in the ice on a frozen body of water. It is practised by [[hunter-gatherer]]s such as the [[Inuit]] and by anglers in other cold or continental climates.\n* [[Kayak fishing]] - has a long history, and has gained popularity in recent times. Many of the techniques used are the same as those used on other fishing boats, apart from difference is in the set-up, how each piece of equipment is fitted to the kayak, and how each activity is carried out on such a small craft.\n* [[Kite fishing]] has long been used in China and by the people of [[New Guinea]] and other [[Pacific Islands]]. Kites can provide the fishermen access to waters that would otherwise be available only with boats. Similarly, for boat owners, kites provide a way to fish in areas where it is not safe to navigate such as shallows or coral reefs where fish may be plentiful. Kites can also be used for trolling a lure through the water. Suitable kites may be of very simple construction. Those of [[Tobi (island)|Tobi Island]] are a large leaf stiffened by the ribs of the fronds of the coconut palm. The fishing line may be made from coconut fibre and the lure made from spiders webs.<ref>[http://www.kitelife.com/kitelines/welcome.htm KiteLines Fall 1977 (Vol. 1 No. 3) Articles on Kite Fishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613191559/http://www.kitelife.com/kitelines/welcome.htm |date=2006-06-13 }}.</ref> Modern kitefishing is popular in New Zealand, where large delta kites of synthetic materials are used to fish from beaches,<ref>[http://www.fishingkites.co.nz/popup/kitedropper.htm Big Dropper Rigs]</ref> taking a line and hooks far out past the breakers. Kite fishing is also emerging in [[Melbourne]] where sled kites are becoming popular, both off beaches and off boats and in freshwater areas. The disabled community are increasingly using the kites for fishing as they allow mobility impaired people to cast the bait further out than they would otherwise be able to.\n* Kontiki Fishing - is the practice of using either a Kontiki sailing raft, or a modern motorised torpedo device to pull a longline (up to 25 hooks) from the beach up to two thousand metres offshore. This method of fishing is very popular on the surf beaches of New Zealand. The electric kontikis can also be used to pull surfcasting lines and baits offshore, before releasing them to fish. Modern electric kontikis use electric trolling motors, lithium batteries and GPS controlled autopilots, and electric winches are used to retrieve the line, hooks and kontiki back to shore.\n* [[Recreational boat fishing|Boat anglers]] - Fishing is usually done either from a boat or from a shoreline or river bank. When fishing from a boat, pretty much any fishing technique can be used, from nets to fish traps, but some form of angling is by far the most common. Compared to fishing from the land, fishing from a boat allows more access to different fishing grounds and different species of fish. Some [[Fishing tackle|tackle]] is specialised for boat anglers, such as [[Fishing rod#Sea rods|sea rods]].\n* [[Remote control fishing]] - Fishing can also be done using a [[radio-controlled boat|remote controlled boat]]. This type of fishing is commonly referred to as ''RC fishing''. The boat is usually one to three feet long and runs on a small DC battery. A [[radio transmitter]] controls the boat. The fisherman connects the fishing line/bait to the boat; drives it; navigating the water by manipulating the [[remote control]]ler.  The technique is growing in popularity.\n\n==Trapping==\n{{main|Fish trap}}\n[[File:\u0110\u00f3.jpg|thumb|Fishermen with traditional fish traps, [[H\u00e0 T\u00e2y]], [[Vietnam]]]]\n[[File:Wooden Fish Wheel.jpg|thumb|right|A typical wooden fish wheel]]\n[[File:Lobster pots at Beer, Devon.JPG|thumbnail|right|Lobster pots on the beach at [[Beer, Devon]]]]\nTraps are culturally almost universal and seem to have been independently invented many times. There are essentially two types of trap, a permanent or semi-permanent structure placed in a river or tidal area and pot-traps that are baited to attract prey and periodically lifted.\n\n* '''Artisanal techniques'''\n** Dam fishing - An [[Artisan fishing|artisanal]] technique called [[dam]] fishing is used by the [[Baka (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] pygmies. This involves the construction of a temporary dam resulting in a drop in the water levels downstream\u2014allowing fish to be easily collected.<ref>[http://www.pygmies.info/fishing.html Dam Fishing]{{Failed verification|date=November 2010}} Fishing techniques of the Baka.</ref>\n* Basket weir fish traps - were widely used in ancient times. They are shown in medieval illustrations and surviving examples have been found. Basket weirs are about 2 m long and comprise two wicker cones, one inside the other\u2014easy to get into and hard to get out.<ref>[http://www.le.ac.uk/ulas/annualreports/ar99-00/hemington/hemington.html Shooting and Fishing the Trent] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125083502/http://www.le.ac.uk/ulas/annualreports/ar99-00/hemington/hemington.html |date=2007-01-25 }}, ancient fish traps.</ref>\n* [[Fishing weir]] - In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], large fishing weir structures were constructed from wood posts and wattle fences. 'V' shaped structures in rivers could be as long as 60 metres and worked by directing fish towards fish traps or nets. Such fish traps were evidently controversial in medieval England. The [[Magna Carta]] includes a clause requiring that they be removed: ''\"All fish-weirs shall be removed from the Thames, the Medway, and throughout the whole of England, except on the sea coast\".''<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html The Text of Magna Carta], see paragraph 33.</ref>\n* [[Fish wheel]]s - operate alongside streams, much as a water-powered mill wheel. A wheel complete with baskets and paddles is attached to a floating dock. The wheel rotates due to the current of the stream. The baskets on the wheel capture fish travelling upstream and transfer them into a holding tank. When the holding tank is full, the fish are removed.\n* [[Lobster trap]]s - also called lobster pots, are traps used to catch lobsters. They resemble fish traps, yet are usually smaller and consist of several sections. Lobster traps are also used to catch other [[crustacean]]s, such as [[crab]]s and [[crayfish]]. They can be constructed in various shapes, but the design strategy is to make the entry into the trap much easier than exit. The pots are baited and lowered into the water and checked frequently. Historically lobster pots were constructed with wood or metal. Today most traps are made from checkered wire and mesh. It is common for the trap to be weighted down with bricks.  A bait bag is hung in the middle of the trap. In theory the lobster walks up the mesh and then falls into the wire trap. [[Bait fish|Bait]] varies from captain to captain but it is common to use herring. In commercial lobstering five to ten of these traps will be connected with line.  A buoy marks each end of the string of pots. Two buoys are important to make retrieval easier and so captains don't set their traps over each other. Each buoy is painted differently so the various captains can identify their traps.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Animals==\n[[File:Man with cormorant.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese man with fishing cormorant.]]\n* Cooperative human-dolphin fisheries date back to the [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] author and [[natural philosophy|natural philosopher]] [[Pliny the Elder]].<ref>M.B.

In Laguna, men stand in shallow waters of the lagoon, or sit in canoes, forming a line, and waiting for the dolphins to appear.  One or more resident dolphins drives fish towards the waiting fishermen.  Then at a critical moment when the dolphins are close enough to the fishermen, one dolphin emerges from the water for an average duration of 1.4 seconds,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://drnissani.net/mnissani/Dolphins/Dolphins_of_Laguna.htm|title=The Dolphins of Laguna|last=Dr. Moti Nissani|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> performing a unique sequence of movements not otherwise seen in the wild.

Fishermen use the natural fish-hunting instincts of the cormorants to catch fish, but a metal ring placed round the bird's neck prevents large, valuable fish from being swallowed. The fish are instead collected by the fisherman.<ref>[http://www.city.gifu.gifu.jp/kankou/08_eng_01.html Cormorant fishing: history and technique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428140739/http://www.city.gifu.gifu.jp/kankou/08_eng_01.html |date=2007-04-28 }}.</ref>\n* Frigatebirds fishing - The people of [[Nauru]] used trained [[Great Frigatebird|frigatebirds]] to fish on reefs.\n* [[Portuguese Water Dog]]s - Dating from the 16th century in Portugal, Portuguese Water Dogs were used by fishermen to send messages between boats, to retrieve fish and articles from the water, and to guard the fishing boats. [[Labrador Retriever]]s have been used by fishermen to assist in bringing nets to shore; the dog would grab the floating corks on the ends of the nets and pull them to shore.\n* Remora fishing - The practice of tethering a [[remora]], a sucking fish, to a fishing line and using the remora to capture sea turtles probably originated in the Indian Ocean.  The earliest surviving records of the practice are Peter Martyr d'Anghera's 1511 accounts of the second voyage of Columbus to the New World (1494).<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12425/12425-h/12425-h.htm De Orbe Novo, Volume 1, The Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera], Project Gutenberg.</ref> However, these accounts are probably apocryphal, and based on earlier, no longer extant accounts from the Indian Ocean region.\n\n==Other techniques==\n[[File:Jensens Crossing fish survey Dec07 012.jpg|thumb|right|Scientists carrying out a population and species survey using electrofishing equipment]]\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Miraculous Draught of Fishes (La p\u00eache miraculeuse) - James Tissot - overall.jpg|thumb|right|Christ catches fish using a [[Miraculous catch of fish|miracle technique]]]]\n[[File:A laksegiljer, Osterfjord, Norway.jpg|thumb|A laksegiljer in Osterfjord, Norway]]\n\n* '''Artisanal techniques'''\n* [[Basnig]] - a traditional method of fishing in the [[Philippines]] that combines the use of bag nets and attracting fish with high-powered lamps. Specialized outrigger boats known as ''[[basnigan]]'' are used.\n* [[Electrofishing]] - is another recently developed technique, primarily used in freshwater by [[Fisheries science|fisheries scientists]]. Electrofishing uses electricity to stun fish so they can be caught. It is commonly used in scientific surveys, sampling [[Population dynamics of fisheries|fish populations]] for abundance, density, and species composition. When performed correctly, electrofishing results in no permanent harm to fish, which return to their natural state a few minutes after being stunned.\n* [[Fish aggregating device]]s - are man-made objects used to attract [[pelagic fish]] such as [[marlin]], [[tuna]] and [[mahi-mahi]] (dolphin fish). They usually consist of [[buoy]]s or floats tethered to the ocean floor with concrete blocks.\n* [[Fishing dredge|Dredging]] - There are types of dredges used for collecting [[scallop]]s, [[oyster]]s or [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]]s from the seabed. They have the form of a scoop made of chain mesh and they are towed by a fishing boat. Dredging can be destructive to the seabed, because the marine life is unable to survive the weight of the dredge. It is extremely detrimental to [[coral]] beds since they take centuries to rebuild themselves. Unmonitored dredging can be compared to unmonitored forest clearing, where it can wipe out ecosystems. Nowadays, this method of fishing is often replaced by [[mariculture]] or by scuba diving.\n* [[Fishfinder|Fish finder]]s - are electronic [[sonar]] devices which indicate the presence of fish and fish schools. They are widely used by recreational fishermen. Commercially, they are used with other electronic locating and positioning devices.\n* [[Fishing light attractor]]s - use lights attached (above or underwater) to some structure to attract fish and [[bait fish]]. Fishing light attractor are operated every night. After a while,  fish discover the increased concentration of bait surrounding the light. Once located, the fish return regularly, and can be harvested.\n* [[Flosser|Flossing]] -\n* Harvesting machines - have recently been developed for commercial fishing. Harvesting machines use pumps to pump fish out of the sea. Dredges have also been mechanized so that they directly transfer mollusks to the surface as are dredged.\n* [[Payaos]] - a type of fish aggregating device used in [[Southeast Asia]], particularly in the [[Philippines]].  Payaos were traditionally bamboo rafts for [[handline]] fishing before World War II, but modern [[steel]] payaos use [[Fishing light attractor|fish lights]] and [[Fishfinder|fish location sonar]] to increase yields.  While payaos fishing is [[sustainability|sustainable]] on a small scale, the large scale, modern applications have been linked to adverse impacts on [[fish stocks]].\n* [[Shrimp baiting]] - is a method used by recreational fisherman for of catching [[shrimp]]. It uses a [[cast net]], [[Fishing bait|bait]] and long poles. The poles are used to mark a specific location and then bait is thrown in the water near the pole.  After several minutes the cast net is thrown as close to the bait as possible and shrimp are caught in the net.  In the 1980s the sport became popular in the south eastern coastal states of the USA.\n* Laksegiljer - small cabins standing on stilts where a fisherman sits. This method of fishing entails a net where the opening is controlled by a line tied to a rock. Under the cabin on the seabed is a white plank. When a salmon swim across the plank, the fisherman sees it and throws the rock into the water so the line closes the opening of the net, trapping the salmon. In [[Norway]] this method of fishing is banned, but in Osterfjord locals can obtain a special permit to use this method in order to maintain the old traditions.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Destructive techniques==\n[[Destructive fishing practices]] are practices that easily result in irreversible damage to aquatic habitats and ecosystems. Many fishing techniques can be destructive if used inappropriately, but some practices are particularly likely to result in irreversible damage. These practices are mostly, though not always, illegal. Where they are illegal, they are often inadequately enforced. Some examples are:\n\n=== Blast fishing ===\n{{Main|Blast fishing}}\n\nDynamite or [[blast fishing]] is done easily and cheaply with [[dynamite]] or [[Improvised explosive device|homemade bombs]] made from locally available materials. Fish are killed by the shock from the blast and are then skimmed from the surface or collected from the bottom. The explosions indiscriminately kill large numbers of fish and other marine organisms in the vicinity and can damage or destroy the physical environment. Explosions are particularly harmful to coral reefs.<ref>[http://stigmes.gr/br/brpages/articles/dinambr.htm Explosions In The Cretan Sea: The scourge of illegal fishing] -- fishing with explosives.</ref> Blast fishing is also illegal in many waterways around the world.\n\n=== Bottom trawling ===\n{{Main|Bottom trawling}}\n\n[[Bottom trawling]] is [[trawling]] (towing a '''trawl''', which is a [[fishing net]]) along the sea floor. It is also referred to as \"dragging\". The scientific community divides bottom trawling into [[Benthic zone|benthic]] trawling and [[Demersal zone|demersal]] trawling. Benthic trawling is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean and demersal trawling is towing a net just above the benthic zone. Bottom trawling targets both bottom-living fish ([[groundfish]]) and semi-pelagic species such as [[cod]], [[squid]], [[shrimp]], and [[Sebastes|rockfish]].\n\nBottom fishing has operated for over a century on heavily fished grounds such as the [[North Sea]] and [[Grand Banks]]. While [[overfishing]] has long been recognised as causing major ecological changes to the fish community on the Grand Banks, concern has been raised more recently about the damage which benthic trawling inflicts upon seabed communities.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Beam trawling on the North Sea\n |publisher   = Greenpeace\n |url         = http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/cbio/beam.html\n |accessdate  = 2009-01-12\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081210112607/http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/cbio/beam.html\n |archivedate = 2008-12-10\n}}\n</ref> A species of particular concern is the slow growing, deep water [[coral]] ''[[Lophelia pertusa]]''. This species is home to a diverse community of deep sea organisms, but is easily damaged by fishing gear. On 17 November 2004, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] urged nations to consider temporary bans on high seas bottom trawling.<ref>{{UN document |docid=A-59-PV.56 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim Report |session=59 |meeting=56 |page=4 |anchor=pg004-bk02 |date=17 November 2004 |speakername=Ms. Kimball | speakernation=International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources |accessdate=2009-05-09 }}</ref>\n\n=== Cyanide fishing ===\n{{Main|Cyanide fishing}}\n\n[[Cyanide fishing]] is a method of collecting live fish mainly for use in [[aquarium]]s, which involves spraying a [[sodium cyanide]] mixture into the desired fish's habitat in order to stun the fish. The practice hurts not only the target population, but also many other marine organisms, including [[coral]] and thus [[coral reef]]s.\n\nRecent studies have shown that the combination of cyanide use and stress of post capture handling results in mortality of up to 75% of the organisms within less than 48 hours of capture. With such high mortality numbers, a greater number of fish must be caught in order to offset post catch death.\n\n=== Muro-ami ===\n{{Main|Muro-ami}}\n\n[[Muro-ami]] is a destructive artisan fishing method employed on coral reefs in Southeast Asia. An encircling net is used with pounding devices, such as large stones fitted on ropes that are pounded onto the coral reefs. They can also consist of large heavy blocks of cement suspended above the sea by a crane fitted to the vessel. The pounding devices are repeatedly lowered into the area encircled by the net, smashing the coral into small fragments in order to scare the fish out of their coral refuges. The \"crushing\" effect on the coral heads has been described as having long-lasting and practically totally destructive effects.<ref>[[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/12353/en Destructive fishing practices]\n</ref>\n\n==History==\nAncient remains of [[spear]]s, [[fishing hook|hooks]] and [[fish net]] have been found in ruins of the [[Stone Age]]. The people of the early civilization drew pictures of nets and fishing lines in their arts (Parker 2002). Early hooks were made from the upper bills of [[eagle]]s and from bones, shells, horns and plant thorns. Spears were tipped with the same materials, or sometimes with flints. Lines and nets were made from leaves, plant stalk and cocoon silk. \nLiterature on the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] fishing practices is very scanty. Baines (1992) documented traditional fisheries in the [[Solomon Islands]]. Use of the herbal fish poisons in catching fishes from fresh water and sea documented from [[New Caledonia]] (Dahl 1985). John (1998) documented fishing techniques and overall life style of the Mukkuvar fishing Community of [[Kanyakumari]] district of [[Tamil Nadu]], India. \nTribal people using various plants for medicinal and various purposes (Rai et al. 2000; Singh et al. 1997; Lin 2005) extends the use notion for herbal fish stupefying plants. Use of the fish poisons is very old practice in the history of human kind. In 1212, King Frederick II prohibited the use of certain plant [[piscicide]]s, and by the 15th century similar laws had been decreed in other European countries as well (Wilhelm 1974). All over the globe, indigenous people use various fish poisons to kill the fishes, documented in America (Jeremy 2002) and among [[Tarahumara]] Indian (Gajdusek 1954).\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/1617/en Fishing gears and methods]\n* [[FAO]]: Fact Sheets: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/1617/en Fishing Technique]\n* [[FAO]]: Fact Sheets: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/search/en Fishing Gear type]\n* [[FAO]]: (1964) [https://archive.org/details/modernfishinggea034788mbp ''Modern Fishing Gear Of The World 2''] Fishing News Books.

The term may also be applied to methods for catching other [[aquatic animal]]s such as [[mollusc]]s ([[shellfish]], [[squid]], [[octopus]]) and edible marine [[invertebrate]]s.\n\n[[Fishing]] techniques include [[Gathering seafood by hand|hand-gathering]], [[spearfishing]], [[Fish net|netting]], [[angling]] and [[Fish trap|trapping]]. [[Recreational fishing|Recreational]], [[Commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[Artisan fishing|artisanal]] fishers use different techniques, and also, sometimes, the same techniques. Recreational fishers fish for pleasure or sport, while commercial fishers fish for profit. Artisanal fishers use traditional, low-tech methods, for survival in [[developing countries]], and as a cultural heritage in other countries. Mostly, recreational fishers use angling methods and commercial fishers use netting methods.\n\nThere is an intricate link between various fishing techniques and knowledge about the fish and their behaviour including [[Fish migration|migration]], [[Forage fish|foraging]] and [[Marine biology#Oceanic habitats|habitat]]. The effective use of fishing techniques often depends on this additional knowledge.<ref>Keegan, William F (1986) [https://web.archive.org/web/20080703210618/http://www.arqueologiamendoza.com/wikisrc/images/b/b5/The_Optimal_Foraging_Analysis_of_Horticultural_Production.pdf ''The Optimal Foraging Analysis of Horticultural Production''] American Anthropologist, New Series, Vol. 88, No. 1., pp. 92-107.</ref> Which techniques are appropriate is dictated mainly by the target species and by its habitat.<ref>F.T.D. Website (2013) [http://www.fishingtipsdepot.com Fishing Tips and Techniques] - Retrieved on 2013-24-07</ref>\n\nFishing techniques can be contrasted with [[fishing tackle]]. Fishing tackle refers to the physical equipment that is used when fishing, whereas fishing techniques refers to the manner in which the tackle is used when fishing.\n\n==Hand-gathering==\n{{see also|Gathering seafood by hand}}\nIt is possible to harvest many sea foods with minimal equipment by using the hands. Gathering [[seafood]] by hand can be as easy as picking [[shellfish]] or [[kelp]] up off the [[beach]], or doing some digging for [[clam]]s or [[crab]]s. The earliest evidence for shellfish gathering dates back to a 300,000-year-old site in France called [[Terra Amata (archaeological site)|Terra Amata]]. This is a [[hominid]] site as [[Anatomically modern human|modern ''Homo sapiens'']] did not appear in Europe until around 50,000 years ago.<ref>Szabo</ref><ref>Szabo, Katherine [http://www.manandmollusc.net/history_food.html ''Prehistoric Shellfish gathering.'']</ref>\n\n[[File:Ama2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ama diver]] in Japan]]\n* [[Flounder tramping]] - Every August, the small [[Scotland|Scottish]] village of [[Palnackie]] hosts the world flounder tramping championships where flounder are captured by stepping on them.\n* [[Noodling]]: Practiced in the United States, mostly in the [[Southern United States|South]].

They feature widely in early mythology and history.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Netting==\n{{Main|Fishing net}}\n\nFishing nets are [[mesh]]es usually formed by knotting a relatively thin thread. About 180 AD the Greek author [[Oppian]] wrote the ''Halieutica'', a didactic poem about fishing. He described various means of fishing including the use of nets cast from boats, scoop nets held open by a hoop, and various traps \"which work while their masters sleep\".\n\nNetting is the principal method of commercial fishing, though [[Longline fishing|longlining]], [[Troll (angling)|trolling]], [[Fishing dredge|dredging]] and [[Fish trap|traps]] are also used.\n\n[[File:Kerala fisherman.jpg|thumb|right|A fisherman casting a net in [[Kerala]], India]]\n[[File:Eilif Peterssen-Laksefiskeren (1889).jpg|thumb|right|Oil painting of gillnetting, ''The salmon fisher'' by Eilif Peterssen]]\n[[File:Fishing, C\u00e0 Mau.jpg|thumb|right|Fishing with nets in [[C\u00e0 Mau Province]], [[Vietnam]]]]\n\n* '''Artisanal techniques'''\n** [[Chinese fishing nets]] - are shore operated lift nets.<ref>[http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/geartype?fid=255 Shore operated stationary lift nets]</ref> Huge mechanical contrivances hold out horizontal nets with diameters of twenty metres or more.

Since [[Ancient Rome|Roman times]], [[Malta|Maltese]] fishers have cut the larger, lower [[frond]]s from [[palm tree]]s which they then weave into large flat rafts. The rafts are pulled out to sea by a [[luzzu]], a small traditional [[fishing vessel|fishing boat]]. In the middle of the day, lampuki fish (the Maltese name for [[mahi-mahi]]) school underneath the rafts, seeking the shade, and are caught by the fishers using large mesh nets.\n* [[Cast net]]s - are round nets with small [[Fishing sinker|weights]] distributed around the edge. They are also called ''throw nets.'' The net is [[Casting (fishing)|caste]] or thrown by hand in such a manner that it spreads out on the water and sinks. Fish are caught as the net is hauled back in.<ref name=\"Dunbar\">Dunbar, Jeffery A (2001) [http://www.nccoastalfishing.com/index.htm?casting.htm~main ''Casting net''] NC Coastal fishing.

They are usually gillnets, and are commonly used in the coastal waters of many countries. Their use on the [[high seas]] is prohibited, but still occurs.\n* [[Ghost net]]s -  are nets that have been lost at sea. They can be a menace to marine life for many years.\n* [[Gillnet]]s - catch fish which try to pass through by snagging on the gill covers. Trapped, the fish can neither advance through the net nor retreat.\n* [[Haaf net fishing|Haaf nets]] - mainly used in the [[Solway Firth]] forming part of the border between [[England]] and [[Scotland]]. Brought to [[Great Britain]] by the [[Vikings]] a thousand years ago, the technique involves the fisherman wading out to deep waters with a large rectangular net and waiting for [[salmon]] to swim into it. The fish is then scooped up by the raising of the net.\n* [[Hand net]]s - are small nets held open by a hoop. They have been used since antiquity. They are also called scoop nets, and are used for scooping up fish near the surface of the water. They may or may not have a handle\u2013if they have a long handle they are called ''dip nets''. When used by anglers to help land fish they are called ''landing nets''.<ref name=\"Fishing Tools - Landing Nets\">[http://www.abc-of-fishing.net/fishing-tools/landing-net.asp Fishing Tools - Landing Nets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915101844/http://www.abc-of-fishing.net/fishing-tools/landing-net.asp |date=2008-09-15 }}</ref> Because hand netting is not destructive to fish, hand nets are used for [[tag and release]], or capturing [[aquarium fish]].\n* [[Seine fishing|Seine nets]] - are large fishing nets that can be arranged in different ways. In [[purse seining]] fishing the net hangs vertically in the water by attaching weights along the bottom edge and floats along the top. [[Seine fishing#Danish seine|Danish seining]] is a method which has some similarities with [[trawling]]. A simple and commonly used fishing technique is beach seining, where the seine net is operated from the shore.\n* [[Surrounding net]]s -\n* [[Tangle net]]s - also known as ''tooth nets'', are similar to gillnets except they have a smaller mesh size designed to catch fish by the teeth or upper jaw bone instead of by the gills.<ref>[http://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/commercial/selective/methods.html Selective Fishing Methods] '' Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife''. Retrieved 13 November 2011.</ref>\n* [[Trawling|Trawl nets]] - are large nets, conical in shape, designed to be towed in the sea or along the sea bottom. The trawl is pulled through the water by one or more boats, called [[Commercial trawler|trawlers]]. The activity of pulling the trawl through the water is called trawling.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Angling==\n{{main|Angling}}\n[[File:Trolling for bluefish2.jpg|thumb|right|\"Trolling for blue fish\" [[lithograph]] by [[Currier & Ives]], 1866]]\n[[File:Jigging off Queenscliff Pier, Vic, jjron 5.12.2009.jpg|thumb|right|Fishermen using [[jiggerpole]]s for [[jigging]] from the [[Queenscliff, Victoria|Queenscliff]] pier]]\n'''Angling''' is a method of fishing by means of an \"angle\" ([[Fish hook|hook]]). The hook is usually attached to a [[fishing line|line]], and is sometimes weighed down by a [[fishing sinker|sinker]] so it sinks in the water. This is the classic \"hook, line and sinker\" arrangement, used in angling since prehistoric times. The hook is usually [[Fishing bait|baited]] with [[Fishing lure|lures]] or [[bait fish]].\n\nAdditional arrangements include the use of a [[fishing rod]], which can be fitted with a [[Fishing reel|reel]], and functions as a delivery mechanism for [[Casting (fishing)|casting]] the line. Other delivery methods for projecting the line include fishing kites and cannons, kontiki rafts and remote controlled devices. [[Float (fishing)|Float]]s can also be used to help set the line or function as [[bite indicator]]s.  The hook can be dressed with [[fishing lure|lure]]s or [[Fishing bait|bait]]. Angling is the principal method of [[sport fishing]], but [[Commercial fishing|commercial fisheries]] also use angling methods involving multiple hooks, such as [[Longline fishing|longlining]] or commercial [[Troll (angling)|trolling]].\n\n===Line fishing===\nLine fishing is fishing with a [[fishing line]]. A fishing line is any cord made for fishing. Important parameters of a fishing line are its length, material, and weight (thicker, sturdier lines are more visible to fish). Factors that may determine what line an angler chooses for a given fishing environment include breaking [[strength of materials|strength]], knot strength, UV resistance, castability, limpness, stretch, abrasion resistance, and visibility.\n\nModern fishing lines are usually made from artificial substances. The most common type is ''[[monofilament line|monofilament]]'', made of a single strand. There are also ''[[braided fishing line]]s'' and thermally fused [[Multifilament fishing line|''superlines'']].\n\n* [[Dropline|Droplining]] - a dropline consists of a long [[fishing line]] set vertically down into the water, with a series of [[Fish bait|baited]] [[Fishing hook|hooks]] Droplines have a [[Fishing sinker|weight]] at the bottom and a [[Fishing float|float]] at the top. They are not usually as long as longlines and have fewer hooks.\n* [[Handline fishing|Handlining]] - is fishing with a single fishing line, baited with [[Fishing lure|lures]] or [[bait fish]], which is held in the hands. Handlining can be done from boats or from the shore. It is used mainly to catch [[groundfish]] and [[squid]], but smaller [[pelagic fish]] can also be caught.\n* [[Jiggerpole]] -\n* [[Jigging]] - is the practice of fishing with a jig, a type of fishing lure. A jig consists of a lead sinker with a hook molded into it and usually covered by a soft body to attract fish. Jigs are intended to create a jerky, vertical motion, as opposed to spinnerbaits which move through the water horizontally.\n* [[Longline fishing|Longlining]] - is a commercial technique that uses a long heavy fishing line with a series of hundreds or even thousands of [[Fish bait|baited]] [[Fishing hook|hooks]] hanging from the main line by means of branch lines called \"snoods\". Longlines are usually operated from specialised boats called longliners. They use a special winch to haul in the line, and can operate in deeper waters targeting [[pelagic]] species such as [[swordfish]], [[tuna]], [[halibut]] and [[sablefish]].\n[[File:Slabbing jig fishing lure.jpg|thumb|right|Slab]]\n* Slabbing: is a [[bass fishing]] technique, that involves repetitively lifting and dropping a flat lure, usually made of 1 to 2.5 oz of lead painted to look like a [[baitfish]] (or heavy slabs of metal), through a [[Swarm|school]] of actively feeding fish that the angler has located on a [[fishfinder]]. Used on [[white bass|white]] and [[striped bass]] in the reservoirs of the southern USA.\n* [[Trolling (fishing)|Trolling]] - is fishing with one or more baited lines which are drawn through the water. This may be done by pulling the line behind a slow moving boat, or by slowly winding the line in when fishing from the land. Trolling is used to catch pelagic fish such as [[mackerel]] and [[King mackerel|kingfish]].\n{{externalimage\n|align=right\n|width=180px\n|image1=[http://www.afma.gov.au/information/students/methods/pelagic.htm Pelagic longline]\n|image2=[http://www.afma.gov.au/information/students/methods/droplines.htm Dropline]\n|image3=[http://www.whiskerkitty.com/images/TrotlineDraw.jpg Trotline for catfish]\n}}\n* [[Trotline|Trotlining]] - a trotline is like a dropline, except that a dropline has a series of hooks suspended vertically in the water, while a trotline has a series of hooks suspended horizontally in the water. Trotlines can be physically set in many ways, such as tying each end to something fixed, and adjusting the set of the rest of the line with [[Fishing sinker|weights]] and [[Fishing float|floats]]. They are used for catching crabs or fish, such as catfish, particularly across rivers.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n===Angling with a rod===\n[[File:Fishing off pier.jpg|thumb|right|Angling with a rod.]]\n[[File:MuriwaiExtremeFishing3b.jpg|thumb|right|Extreme rock fishing off [[Muriwai|Muriwai Beach]], New Zealand]]\n[[File:Float-tube-pikeangler.jpg|right|thumb|An angler in his float tube plays a hooked pike.]]\n[[Fishing rod]]s give more control of the fishing line. The rod is usually fitted with a [[fishing reel]] which functions as a mechanism for storing, retrieving and paying out the line. [[Float (fishing)|Float]]s may also be used, and can function as [[bite indicator]]s. The hook can be dressed with [[fishing lure|lure]]s or [[Fishing bait|bait]].\n* [[Bank fishing]] - fishing from [[river bank]]s and similar shorelines. Bank fishing is usually performed with a fishing rod and reel, although nets, traps, and spears can also be used. People who fish from a boat can sometimes access more areas in prime locations with greater ease than bank fishermen. However many people don't own boats and find fishing from the bank has its own advantages. Bank fishing has its own requirements, and many things come into play for success, such as local knowledge, water depth, bank structure, location, time of day, and the type of bait and lures.\n* [[Casting (fishing)|Casting]] - the act of throwing the fishing line out over the water using a flexible fishing rod. The usual technique is for the angler to quickly flick the rod from behind toward the water.<ref>{{cite book|title=Fly Fishing Saltwater Basics: Saltwater Basics|author=C. Boyd Pfeiffer|year= 1999|publisher=Stackpole Books|isbn=0-8117-2763-7}}</ref> Casting is also a sport adjunct to [[fishing]], much as [[shooting]] is to [[hunting]]. The sport is supervised by the International Casting Sport Federation, which sponsors tournaments and recognizes world records for accuracy and distance. Some variations of the technique exist, such as [[Surf fishing]], the [[Reach cast]], and [[Spey casting]].\n* [[Float tube]]s - small doughnut-shaped boats with an underwater seat in the \"hole\". Float tubes are used for fly fishing and enable the angler to reach deeper water without splashing and disturbing stillwater fish.\n* [[Fly fishing]] - the use of [[Artificial fly|artificial flies]] as lures. These are cast with specially constructed [[fishing rod|fly rod]]s and fly lines. The fly line (today, almost always coated with plastic) is heavy enough cast in order to send the fly to the target. Artificial flies vary dramatically in size, weight and colour. Fly fishing is a distinct and ancient angling method, most renowned as a method for catching [[trout]] and [[salmon]], but employed today for a wide variety of species including [[Esox|pike]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], [[panfish]], and [[carp]], as well as [[ocean|marine]] species, such as [[Red drum|redfish]], [[Common snook|snook]], [[tarpon]], [[bonefish]] and [[striped bass]]. There is a growing population of anglers whose aim is to catch as many different species as possible with the fly.\n* [[Tenkara fishing]] - Tenkara is a form of fly fishing that originated in Japan over 200 years ago. It was originally done with a bamboo pole between 12' and 20' with the line tied directly on the tip of the rod requiring no reel. Modern tenkara rods are usually made of graphite and are telescopic. Unlike western style fly fishing tenkara uses either a tapered line or a level line and forgoes the PVC coated fly fishing line. Typical target species include [[trout]] and [[char]] but most smaller freshwater species can be caught by this method.\n* [[Rock fishing]] - fishing from rocky outcrops into the sea. It is a popular pastime in Australia and New Zealand. It can be a dangerous pastime and claims many lives each year.\n*Pitch Fishing - also known as \u201cpitching\u201d or \u201cpitch fishing,\u201d is a technique designed to deliver the lure quietly and at a distance over the water.The lure will fly high and far out over the water, landing in a loud splash. Pitch fishing involves sending the lure out a lower angle, and thus making a smaller splash which will hopefully not scare the fish.<ref>{{cite web | title=pitch fishing | year=2013 | author=j.WALKER Network | publisher=www.theoutdooractivity.com | url=http://www.theoutdooractivity.com/flip-pitch-bass-fishing-lures/ | accessdate=2014-04-21}}</ref>\n* [[Surf fishing|Surfcasting]] - fishing from a [[shoreline]] using a rod to cast into the [[Ocean surface wave|surf]].  With few exceptions, surf fishing is done in [[Seawater|saltwater]], often from a [[beach]]. The basic idea of most surfcasting is to cast a [[Fishing bait|bait]] or [[Fishing lure|lure]] as far out into the water as is necessary to reach the target fish from the shore. This may or may not require long casting distances and muscular techniques. Basic surf fishing can be done with a [[Fishing rod#Surf rods|surfcasting rod]] between seven and twelve feet long, with an extended butt section, equipped with an appropriate spinning or conventional casting [[Fishing reel|reel]]. Dedicated surfcasters usually possess an array of terminal and other tackle, with rods and reels of different lengths and actions, and lures and baits of different weights and capabilities. Depending on fishing conditions and the fish they are targeting, such surfcasters tailor bait and terminal tackle to rod and reel and the size and species of the fish. Reels and other equipment need to be constructed so they resist the corrosive and abrasive effects of salt and sand.\n\n===Other angling===\n* [[Bottom fishing]] - is fishing the bottom of a body of water. In the United Kingdom it is called \"ledgering\". A common rig for fishing on the bottom is a weight tied to the end of the line, with a hook about an inch up line from the weight. The method can be used both with hand lines and rods. There are fishing rods specialized for bottom fishing, called \"donkas\". The weight is used to cast or throw the line an appropriate distance. Bottom fishing can be done both from boats and from the land. It targets [[groundfish]] such as [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]], [[bream]], [[catfish]], and [[crappie]].\n* [[Ice fishing]] - is the practice of catching fish with lines and hooks through an opening in the ice on a frozen body of water. It is practised by [[hunter-gatherer]]s such as the [[Inuit]] and by anglers in other cold or continental climates.\n* [[Kayak fishing]] - has a long history, and has gained popularity in recent times. Many of the techniques used are the same as those used on other fishing boats, apart from difference is in the set-up, how each piece of equipment is fitted to the kayak, and how each activity is carried out on such a small craft.\n* [[Kite fishing]] has long been used in China and by the people of [[New Guinea]] and other [[Pacific Islands]]. Kites can provide the fishermen access to waters that would otherwise be available only with boats. Similarly, for boat owners, kites provide a way to fish in areas where it is not safe to navigate such as shallows or coral reefs where fish may be plentiful. Kites can also be used for trolling a lure through the water. Suitable kites may be of very simple construction. Those of [[Tobi (island)|Tobi Island]] are a large leaf stiffened by the ribs of the fronds of the coconut palm. The fishing line may be made from coconut fibre and the lure made from spiders webs.<ref>[http://www.kitelife.com/kitelines/welcome.htm KiteLines Fall 1977 (Vol. 1 No. 3) Articles on Kite Fishing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613191559/http://www.kitelife.com/kitelines/welcome.htm |date=2006-06-13 }}.</ref> Modern kitefishing is popular in New Zealand, where large delta kites of synthetic materials are used to fish from beaches,<ref>[http://www.fishingkites.co.nz/popup/kitedropper.htm Big Dropper Rigs]</ref> taking a line and hooks far out past the breakers. Kite fishing is also emerging in [[Melbourne]] where sled kites are becoming popular, both off beaches and off boats and in freshwater areas. The disabled community are increasingly using the kites for fishing as they allow mobility impaired people to cast the bait further out than they would otherwise be able to.\n* Kontiki Fishing - is the practice of using either a Kontiki sailing raft, or a modern motorised torpedo device to pull a longline (up to 25 hooks) from the beach up to two thousand metres offshore. This method of fishing is very popular on the surf beaches of New Zealand. The electric kontikis can also be used to pull surfcasting lines and baits offshore, before releasing them to fish. Modern electric kontikis use electric trolling motors, lithium batteries and GPS controlled autopilots, and electric winches are used to retrieve the line, hooks and kontiki back to shore.\n* [[Recreational boat fishing|Boat anglers]] - Fishing is usually done either from a boat or from a shoreline or river bank. When fishing from a boat, pretty much any fishing technique can be used, from nets to fish traps, but some form of angling is by far the most common. Compared to fishing from the land, fishing from a boat allows more access to different fishing grounds and different species of fish. Some [[Fishing tackle|tackle]] is specialised for boat anglers, such as [[Fishing rod#Sea rods|sea rods]].\n* [[Remote control fishing]] - Fishing can also be done using a [[radio-controlled boat|remote controlled boat]]. This type of fishing is commonly referred to as ''RC fishing''. The boat is usually one to three feet long and runs on a small DC battery. A [[radio transmitter]] controls the boat. The fisherman connects the fishing line/bait to the boat; drives it; navigating the water by manipulating the [[remote control]]ler.  The technique is growing in popularity.\n\n==Trapping==\n{{main|Fish trap}}\n[[File:\u0110\u00f3.jpg|thumb|Fishermen with traditional fish traps, [[H\u00e0 T\u00e2y]], [[Vietnam]]]]\n[[File:Wooden Fish Wheel.jpg|thumb|right|A typical wooden fish wheel]]\n[[File:Lobster pots at Beer, Devon.JPG|thumbnail|right|Lobster pots on the beach at [[Beer, Devon]]]]\nTraps are culturally almost universal and seem to have been independently invented many times. There are essentially two types of trap, a permanent or semi-permanent structure placed in a river or tidal area and pot-traps that are baited to attract prey and periodically lifted.\n\n* '''Artisanal techniques'''\n** Dam fishing - An [[Artisan fishing|artisanal]] technique called [[dam]] fishing is used by the [[Baka (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] pygmies. This involves the construction of a temporary dam resulting in a drop in the water levels downstream\u2014allowing fish to be easily collected.<ref>[http://www.pygmies.info/fishing.html Dam Fishing]{{Failed verification|date=November 2010}} Fishing techniques of the Baka.</ref>\n* Basket weir fish traps - were widely used in ancient times. They are shown in medieval illustrations and surviving examples have been found. Basket weirs are about 2 m long and comprise two wicker cones, one inside the other\u2014easy to get into and hard to get out.<ref>[http://www.le.ac.uk/ulas/annualreports/ar99-00/hemington/hemington.html Shooting and Fishing the Trent] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125083502/http://www.le.ac.uk/ulas/annualreports/ar99-00/hemington/hemington.html |date=2007-01-25 }}, ancient fish traps.</ref>\n* [[Fishing weir]] - In [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]], large fishing weir structures were constructed from wood posts and wattle fences. 'V' shaped structures in rivers could be as long as 60 metres and worked by directing fish towards fish traps or nets. Such fish traps were evidently controversial in medieval England. The [[Magna Carta]] includes a clause requiring that they be removed: ''\"All fish-weirs shall be removed from the Thames, the Medway, and throughout the whole of England, except on the sea coast\".''<ref>[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/magnacarta.html The Text of Magna Carta], see paragraph 33.</ref>\n* [[Fish wheel]]s - operate alongside streams, much as a water-powered mill wheel. A wheel complete with baskets and paddles is attached to a floating dock. The wheel rotates due to the current of the stream. The baskets on the wheel capture fish travelling upstream and transfer them into a holding tank. When the holding tank is full, the fish are removed.\n* [[Lobster trap]]s - also called lobster pots, are traps used to catch lobsters. They resemble fish traps, yet are usually smaller and consist of several sections. Lobster traps are also used to catch other [[crustacean]]s, such as [[crab]]s and [[crayfish]]. They can be constructed in various shapes, but the design strategy is to make the entry into the trap much easier than exit. The pots are baited and lowered into the water and checked frequently. Historically lobster pots were constructed with wood or metal. Today most traps are made from checkered wire and mesh. It is common for the trap to be weighted down with bricks.  A bait bag is hung in the middle of the trap. In theory the lobster walks up the mesh and then falls into the wire trap. [[Bait fish|Bait]] varies from captain to captain but it is common to use herring. In commercial lobstering five to ten of these traps will be connected with line.  A buoy marks each end of the string of pots. Two buoys are important to make retrieval easier and so captains don't set their traps over each other. Each buoy is painted differently so the various captains can identify their traps.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Animals==\n[[File:Man with cormorant.jpg|thumb|right|Chinese man with fishing cormorant.]]\n* Cooperative human-dolphin fisheries date back to the [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] author and [[natural philosophy|natural philosopher]] [[Pliny the Elder]].<ref>M.B.

Fishermen use the natural fish-hunting instincts of the cormorants to catch fish, but a metal ring placed round the bird's neck prevents large, valuable fish from being swallowed. The fish are instead collected by the fisherman.<ref>[http://www.city.gifu.gifu.jp/kankou/08_eng_01.html Cormorant fishing: history and technique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428140739/http://www.city.gifu.gifu.jp/kankou/08_eng_01.html |date=2007-04-28 }}.</ref>\n* Frigatebirds fishing - The people of [[Nauru]] used trained [[Great Frigatebird|frigatebirds]] to fish on reefs.\n* [[Portuguese Water Dog]]s - Dating from the 16th century in Portugal, Portuguese Water Dogs were used by fishermen to send messages between boats, to retrieve fish and articles from the water, and to guard the fishing boats. [[Labrador Retriever]]s have been used by fishermen to assist in bringing nets to shore; the dog would grab the floating corks on the ends of the nets and pull them to shore.\n* Remora fishing - The practice of tethering a [[remora]], a sucking fish, to a fishing line and using the remora to capture sea turtles probably originated in the Indian Ocean.  The earliest surviving records of the practice are Peter Martyr d'Anghera's 1511 accounts of the second voyage of Columbus to the New World (1494).<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12425/12425-h/12425-h.htm De Orbe Novo, Volume 1, The Eight Decades of Peter Martyr D'Anghera], Project Gutenberg.</ref> However, these accounts are probably apocryphal, and based on earlier, no longer extant accounts from the Indian Ocean region.\n\n==Other techniques==\n[[File:Jensens Crossing fish survey Dec07 012.jpg|thumb|right|Scientists carrying out a population and species survey using electrofishing equipment]]\n[[File:Brooklyn Museum - The Miraculous Draught of Fishes (La p\u00eache miraculeuse) - James Tissot - overall.jpg|thumb|right|Christ catches fish using a [[Miraculous catch of fish|miracle technique]]]]\n[[File:A laksegiljer, Osterfjord, Norway.jpg|thumb|A laksegiljer in Osterfjord, Norway]]\n\n* '''Artisanal techniques'''\n* [[Basnig]] - a traditional method of fishing in the [[Philippines]] that combines the use of bag nets and attracting fish with high-powered lamps. Specialized outrigger boats known as ''[[basnigan]]'' are used.\n* [[Electrofishing]] - is another recently developed technique, primarily used in freshwater by [[Fisheries science|fisheries scientists]]. Electrofishing uses electricity to stun fish so they can be caught. It is commonly used in scientific surveys, sampling [[Population dynamics of fisheries|fish populations]] for abundance, density, and species composition. When performed correctly, electrofishing results in no permanent harm to fish, which return to their natural state a few minutes after being stunned.\n* [[Fish aggregating device]]s - are man-made objects used to attract [[pelagic fish]] such as [[marlin]], [[tuna]] and [[mahi-mahi]] (dolphin fish). They usually consist of [[buoy]]s or floats tethered to the ocean floor with concrete blocks.\n* [[Fishing dredge|Dredging]] - There are types of dredges used for collecting [[scallop]]s, [[oyster]]s or [[Holothuroidea|sea cucumber]]s from the seabed. They have the form of a scoop made of chain mesh and they are towed by a fishing boat. Dredging can be destructive to the seabed, because the marine life is unable to survive the weight of the dredge. It is extremely detrimental to [[coral]] beds since they take centuries to rebuild themselves. Unmonitored dredging can be compared to unmonitored forest clearing, where it can wipe out ecosystems. Nowadays, this method of fishing is often replaced by [[mariculture]] or by scuba diving.\n* [[Fishfinder|Fish finder]]s - are electronic [[sonar]] devices which indicate the presence of fish and fish schools. They are widely used by recreational fishermen. Commercially, they are used with other electronic locating and positioning devices.\n* [[Fishing light attractor]]s - use lights attached (above or underwater) to some structure to attract fish and [[bait fish]]. Fishing light attractor are operated every night. After a while,  fish discover the increased concentration of bait surrounding the light. Once located, the fish return regularly, and can be harvested.\n* [[Flosser|Flossing]] -\n* Harvesting machines - have recently been developed for commercial fishing. Harvesting machines use pumps to pump fish out of the sea. Dredges have also been mechanized so that they directly transfer mollusks to the surface as are dredged.\n* [[Payaos]] - a type of fish aggregating device used in [[Southeast Asia]], particularly in the [[Philippines]].  Payaos were traditionally bamboo rafts for [[handline]] fishing before World War II, but modern [[steel]] payaos use [[Fishing light attractor|fish lights]] and [[Fishfinder|fish location sonar]] to increase yields.  While payaos fishing is [[sustainability|sustainable]] on a small scale, the large scale, modern applications have been linked to adverse impacts on [[fish stocks]].\n* [[Shrimp baiting]] - is a method used by recreational fisherman for of catching [[shrimp]]. It uses a [[cast net]], [[Fishing bait|bait]] and long poles. The poles are used to mark a specific location and then bait is thrown in the water near the pole.  After several minutes the cast net is thrown as close to the bait as possible and shrimp are caught in the net.  In the 1980s the sport became popular in the south eastern coastal states of the USA.\n* Laksegiljer - small cabins standing on stilts where a fisherman sits. This method of fishing entails a net where the opening is controlled by a line tied to a rock. Under the cabin on the seabed is a white plank. When a salmon swim across the plank, the fisherman sees it and throws the rock into the water so the line closes the opening of the net, trapping the salmon. In [[Norway]] this method of fishing is banned, but in Osterfjord locals can obtain a special permit to use this method in order to maintain the old traditions.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==Destructive techniques==\n[[Destructive fishing practices]] are practices that easily result in irreversible damage to aquatic habitats and ecosystems. Many fishing techniques can be destructive if used inappropriately, but some practices are particularly likely to result in irreversible damage. These practices are mostly, though not always, illegal. Where they are illegal, they are often inadequately enforced. Some examples are:\n\n=== Blast fishing ===\n{{Main|Blast fishing}}\n\nDynamite or [[blast fishing]] is done easily and cheaply with [[dynamite]] or [[Improvised explosive device|homemade bombs]] made from locally available materials. Fish are killed by the shock from the blast and are then skimmed from the surface or collected from the bottom. The explosions indiscriminately kill large numbers of fish and other marine organisms in the vicinity and can damage or destroy the physical environment. Explosions are particularly harmful to coral reefs.<ref>[http://stigmes.gr/br/brpages/articles/dinambr.htm Explosions In The Cretan Sea: The scourge of illegal fishing] -- fishing with explosives.</ref> Blast fishing is also illegal in many waterways around the world.\n\n=== Bottom trawling ===\n{{Main|Bottom trawling}}\n\n[[Bottom trawling]] is [[trawling]] (towing a '''trawl''', which is a [[fishing net]]) along the sea floor. It is also referred to as \"dragging\". The scientific community divides bottom trawling into [[Benthic zone|benthic]] trawling and [[Demersal zone|demersal]] trawling. Benthic trawling is towing a net at the very bottom of the ocean and demersal trawling is towing a net just above the benthic zone. Bottom trawling targets both bottom-living fish ([[groundfish]]) and semi-pelagic species such as [[cod]], [[squid]], [[shrimp]], and [[Sebastes|rockfish]].\n\nBottom fishing has operated for over a century on heavily fished grounds such as the [[North Sea]] and [[Grand Banks]]. While [[overfishing]] has long been recognised as causing major ecological changes to the fish community on the Grand Banks, concern has been raised more recently about the damage which benthic trawling inflicts upon seabed communities.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title       = Beam trawling on the North Sea\n |publisher   = Greenpeace\n |url         = http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/cbio/beam.html\n |accessdate  = 2009-01-12\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20081210112607/http://archive.greenpeace.org/comms/cbio/beam.html\n |archivedate = 2008-12-10\n}}\n</ref> A species of particular concern is the slow growing, deep water [[coral]] ''[[Lophelia pertusa]]''. This species is home to a diverse community of deep sea organisms, but is easily damaged by fishing gear. On 17 November 2004, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] urged nations to consider temporary bans on high seas bottom trawling.<ref>{{UN document |docid=A-59-PV.56 |body=General Assembly |type=Verbatim Report |session=59 |meeting=56 |page=4 |anchor=pg004-bk02 |date=17 November 2004 |speakername=Ms. Kimball | speakernation=International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources |accessdate=2009-05-09 }}</ref>\n\n=== Cyanide fishing ===\n{{Main|Cyanide fishing}}\n\n[[Cyanide fishing]] is a method of collecting live fish mainly for use in [[aquarium]]s, which involves spraying a [[sodium cyanide]] mixture into the desired fish's habitat in order to stun the fish. The practice hurts not only the target population, but also many other marine organisms, including [[coral]] and thus [[coral reef]]s.\n\nRecent studies have shown that the combination of cyanide use and stress of post capture handling results in mortality of up to 75% of the organisms within less than 48 hours of capture. With such high mortality numbers, a greater number of fish must be caught in order to offset post catch death.\n\n=== Muro-ami ===\n{{Main|Muro-ami}}\n\n[[Muro-ami]] is a destructive artisan fishing method employed on coral reefs in Southeast Asia. An encircling net is used with pounding devices, such as large stones fitted on ropes that are pounded onto the coral reefs. They can also consist of large heavy blocks of cement suspended above the sea by a crane fitted to the vessel. The pounding devices are repeatedly lowered into the area encircled by the net, smashing the coral into small fragments in order to scare the fish out of their coral refuges. The \"crushing\" effect on the coral heads has been described as having long-lasting and practically totally destructive effects.<ref>[[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/12353/en Destructive fishing practices]\n</ref>\n\n==History==\nAncient remains of [[spear]]s, [[fishing hook|hooks]] and [[fish net]] have been found in ruins of the [[Stone Age]]. The people of the early civilization drew pictures of nets and fishing lines in their arts (Parker 2002). Early hooks were made from the upper bills of [[eagle]]s and from bones, shells, horns and plant thorns. Spears were tipped with the same materials, or sometimes with flints. Lines and nets were made from leaves, plant stalk and cocoon silk. \nLiterature on the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] fishing practices is very scanty. Baines (1992) documented traditional fisheries in the [[Solomon Islands]]. Use of the herbal fish poisons in catching fishes from fresh water and sea documented from [[New Caledonia]] (Dahl 1985). John (1998) documented fishing techniques and overall life style of the Mukkuvar fishing Community of [[Kanyakumari]] district of [[Tamil Nadu]], India. \nTribal people using various plants for medicinal and various purposes (Rai et al. 2000; Singh et al. 1997; Lin 2005) extends the use notion for herbal fish stupefying plants. Use of the fish poisons is very old practice in the history of human kind. In 1212, King Frederick II prohibited the use of certain plant [[piscicide]]s, and by the 15th century similar laws had been decreed in other European countries as well (Wilhelm 1974). All over the globe, indigenous people use various fish poisons to kill the fishes, documented in America (Jeremy 2002) and among [[Tarahumara]] Indian (Gajdusek 1954).\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [[FAO]]: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/1617/en Fishing gears and methods]\n* [[FAO]]: Fact Sheets: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/1617/en Fishing Technique]\n* [[FAO]]: Fact Sheets: [http://www.fao.org/fishery/geartype/search/en Fishing Gear type]\n* [[FAO]]: (1964) [https://archive.org/details/modernfishinggea034788mbp ''Modern Fishing Gear Of The World 2''] Fishing News Books.

He was wounded in September 1944, and was evacuated from the Netherlands to Pylewell Park, remaining there until the end of the war. In 1946, the couple moved to a former rectory outside [[Ahoghill]], County Antrim, Glebe House.<ref name=\"Lunney\" />\n\n==Life in Northern Ireland==\nO'Neill was a loyal supporter of her husband's political career in [[Northern Ireland]], from his first election to Stormont as an MP in 1946 to his time as Northern Ireland prime minister from 1963 to 1969. She accompanied him on visits to Great Britain, Europe and the United States. During the first official visit of a Northern Ireland prime minister to France in 1966, O'Neill stood in for her husband to make a speech at an official banquet when he was recalled to Belfast due to an emergency.<ref name=\"Lunney\" />\n\nShe dedicated most of her time to her children, Patrick and Penelope, and to creating a five acre garden at her home, as well as volunteering with local societies and horticultural groups. She served as chair of the Ballymena Horticultural Society, and was the first president of the [[Rose Society of Northern Ireland]] from 1968 to 1975. While chair of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] gardens committee, she made large contributions to the effort to restore the trust's garden at [[Rowallane Garden|Rowallane]], County Down and the development of more trust gardens in Ulster. From 1964, she was a judge of the International Rose Trials in Belfast. She wrote articles for numerous journals, including ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' and ''[[The Journal of Garden History]]'', on garden plants and historical gardens. For ''Recreating the period garden'' (1984) edited by Graham Thomas, O'Neill wrote a 27 page article on plants, and she also contributed to the ''Oxford companion to gardens'' (1986). Her opus was the posthumously published ''Peter Collinson and the eighteenth-century natural history exchange'' (2008), a history of the [[Quakers|Quaker]] merchant, [[Peter Collinson (botanist)|Peter Collinson]] based on 30 years of research by O'Neill.<ref name=\"Lunney\" /><ref name=\"Mulholland\" /><ref name=\"Telegraph\" />\n\n==Later life in Hampshire==\nAfter her husband was pushed out of office in April 1969, and due to the increasing hostility in Northern Ireland, the O'Neills returned to Lymington, to Lisle Court in the grounds of Pylewell Park.

She was involved in the creation of a historically accurate garden based on 17th century planting at [[Compton Garden]], at St Cross Hospital, Winchester while serving as vice-president of the Hampshire Gardens Trust in 1968. Throughout the 1980s, O'Neill made a number of trips to the United States, lecturing on plant and garden history. She accompanied [[Ghillean Prance]] on a plant collecting trip to the Amazon river at age 88. When visiting her son in Australia, she took arduous, long walks in the Australian bush to collect seeds and specimens. O'Neill was a fellow of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]], and served as vice-president of the [[Garden History Society]].

He was wounded in September 1944, and was evacuated from the Netherlands to Pylewell Park, remaining there until the end of the war. In 1946, the couple moved to a former rectory outside [[Ahoghill]], County Antrim, Glebe House.<ref name=\"Lunney\" />\n\n==Life in Northern Ireland==\nO'Neill was a loyal supporter of her husband's political career in [[Northern Ireland]], from his first election to Stormont as an MP in 1946 to his time as Northern Ireland prime minister from 1963 to 1969. She accompanied him on visits to Great Britain, Europe and the United States. During the first official visit of a Northern Ireland prime minister to France in 1966, O'Neill stood in for her husband to make a speech at an official banquet when he was recalled to Belfast due to an emergency.<ref name=\"Lunney\" />\n\nShe dedicated most of her time to her children, Patrick and Penelope, and to creating a five acre garden at her home, as well as volunteering with local societies and horticultural groups. She served as chair of the Ballymena Horticultural Society, and was the first president of the [[Rose Society of Northern Ireland]] from 1968 to 1975. While chair of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] gardens committee, she made large contributions to the effort to restore the trust's garden at [[Rowallane Garden|Rowallane]], County Down and the development of more trust gardens in Ulster. From 1964, she was a judge of the International Rose Trials in Belfast. She wrote articles for numerous journals, including ''[[Country Life (magazine)|Country Life]]'' and ''[[The Journal of Garden History]]'', on garden plants and historical gardens. For ''Recreating the period garden'' (1984) edited by Graham Thomas, O'Neill wrote a 27 page article on plants, and she also contributed to the ''Oxford companion to gardens'' (1986). Her opus was the posthumously published ''Peter Collinson and the eighteenth-century natural history exchange'' (2008), a history of the [[Quakers|Quaker]] merchant, [[Peter Collinson (botanist)|Peter Collinson]] based on 30 years of research by O'Neill.<ref name=\"Lunney\" /><ref name=\"Mulholland\" /><ref name=\"Telegraph\" />\n\n==Later life in Hampshire==\nAfter her husband was pushed out of office in April 1969, and due to the increasing hostility in Northern Ireland, the O'Neills returned to Lymington, to Lisle Court in the grounds of Pylewell Park. Here O'Neill developed another garden of note, famed internationally for its southern hemisphere trees and shrubs. She was involved in the creation of historically accurate garden based on 17th century planting at [[Compton Garden]], at St Cross Hospital, Winchester while serving as vice-president of the Hampshire Gardens Trust in 1968. Throughout the 1980s, O'Neill made a number of trips to the United States, lecturing on plant and garden history. She accompanied [[Ghillean Prance]] on a plant collecting trip to the Amazon river at age 88. When visiting her son in Australia, she took arduous, long walks in the Australian bush to collect seeds and specimens. O'Neill was a fellow of the [[Linnean Society of London|Linnean Society]], and served as vice-president of the [[Garden History Society]]. She was awarded the [[Royal Horticultural Society]]'s [[Veitch Memorial Medal]] in 2000 in recognition of her contribution to horticultural science and practice.<ref name=\"Lunney\" /><ref name=\"Mulholland\" />\n\nAfter the death of her husband in 1990, she was burgled several times with one burglar so impressed by her bravery he apologised to her and alerted the police on her behalf.

Fr\u00e9mont.  The [[Bear Flag Revolt]] and whatever remained of the \"California Republic\" ceased to exist on July 9 when U.S. Navy Lieutenant [[Joseph Warren Revere (general)|Joseph Revere]] raised the [[United States flag]] in front of the [[Sonoma Barracks]] and sent a second flag to be raised at [[Sutter's Fort]].<ref>Bancroft V: 185\u201386</ref>\n\n==Background of the Bear Flag Revolt==\n[[File:P\u00edo Pico cph.31737.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[P\u00edo Pico]] was territorial governor of Alta California south of [[San Luis Obispo]].]]\n\n===Alta California's Governance===\n\nBy 1845\u201346, Alta California had been largely neglected by [[Mexico]] for the twenty-five years since Mexican independence.  It had evolved into a semi-autonomous region with open discussions among [[Californio]]s about whether California should remain with Mexico; seek independence; or become annexed to the United Kingdom, France, or the United States. The 1845 removal of [[Manuel Micheltorena]], the latest governor to be sent by Mexico and forcefully ejected by the Californians, resulted in a divided government.  The region south of [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] was ruled by Governor [[P\u00edo Pico]] with his capital in ''The Town of Our Lady the Queen of Angels of the Porci\u00fancula River'', now known as  [[Los Angeles]].  The area to the north of the pueblo of [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] was under the control of Alta California's [[commander (rank)#Latin America|''Commandante'']] [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]] with headquarters near [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], the traditional capital and, significantly, the location of the [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|Customhouse]]. Pico and Castro disliked each other personally and soon began escalating disputes over control of the Customhouse income.<ref>Walker pp. 42\u201343</ref>\n\nDecrees issued by the central government in Mexico City were often acknowledged and supported with proclamations but ignored in practice.  By the end of 1845, when rumors of a military force being sent from Mexico proved to be false, rulings by the other district government were mostly ignored.<ref>Bancroft IV:540\u2013545</ref>\n\n===Texas, immigration and land===\n[[File:Polkpolk.jpg|175px|thumb|left|U.S. President [[James K. Polk]] favored expansionist policies that led to the annexation of Texas and California.]]\n\nThe relationship between the United States and Mexico had been deteriorating for some time.  The [[Republic of Texas]], which Mexico still considered to be its territory, had been admitted to statehood in 1845.<ref>Hague p 99</ref>  Mexico had earlier threatened war if this happened.<ref name=\"Walker p. 60\">Walker p. 60</ref>  [[James K. Polk]] was elected President of the United States in 1844, and considered his election a mandate for his expansionist policies.<ref>Walker p. 58</ref>\n\nMexican law had long allowed grants of land to [[naturalized]] Mexican citizens.  Obtaining Mexican citizenship was not difficult and many earlier American immigrants had gone through the process and obtained free grants of land.  That same year (1845) anticipation of war with the United States and the increasing number of immigrants reportedly coming from the United States resulted in orders from Mexico City denying immigrants from the United States entry into California.<ref>Hague p.118</ref>  The orders also required California's officials not to allow land grants, sales or even rental of land to non-citizen emigrants already in California.  All non-citizen immigrants, who had arrived without permission, were threatened with being forced out of California.<ref>Bancroft; IV:598\u2013608</ref>\n\nAlta California's Sub-Prefect [[Francisco Guerrero (politician)|Francisco Guerrero]] had written to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]] that:\n{{quote|a multitude of foreigners [having] come into California and bought fixed property [land], a right of [[Naturalization|naturalized foreigners]] only, he was under the necessity of notifying the authorities in each town to inform such purchasers that the transactions were invalid and they themselves subject to be expelled whenever the government might find it convenient.<ref name=\"Richman p 308\"/>}}\n\n[[File:Jose Castro.jpg|150px|thumb|right|California's ''Commandante General'' [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]] commanded Mexican military forces in Alta California.]]\n\nDuring November 1845, California's ''Commandante General'' Jos\u00e9 Castro met with representatives of the 1845 American immigrants at Sonoma and Sutter's Fort.  In his decree dated November 6 he wrote: \"Therefore conciliating my duty [to enforce the orders from Mexico] with of the sentiment of hospitality which distinguishes the Mexicans, and considering that most of said expedition is composed of families and industrious people, I have deemed it best to permit them, provisionally, to remain in the department\" with the conditions that they obey all laws, apply within three months for a license to settle, and promise to depart if that license was not granted.<ref>Bancroft IV: \npp. 606\u20137</ref>\n\n===Captain Fr\u00e9mont in California===\n[[File:John C.

Fr\u00e9mont]].]]\nA 62-man exploring and mapping expedition entered California in late 1845 under the command of U.S. Army Brevet Captain [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]]. Fr\u00e9mont was well known in the United States as an author and explorer. He was also the son-in-law of expansionist U.S. Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]]. Early in 1846 Fr\u00e9mont acted provocatively with California's ''Commandante General'' Jos\u00e9 Castro near the pueblo of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and then moved his group out of California into [[Oregon Country]]. He was followed into Oregon by U.S. Marine Lt [[Archibald H. Gillespie]] who had been sent from Washington with a secret message to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]] and instructions to share the message with Fr\u00e9mont. Gillespie also brought a packet of letters from Fr\u00e9mont's wife and father-in-law.<ref>Hague p. 128</ref>\n\nFr\u00e9mont's thoughts (as related in his book, written forty years later) after reading the message and letters were: \"I saw the way opening clear before me.  War with Mexico was inevitable; and a grand opportunity presented itself to realize in their fullest extent the far-sighted views of Senator Benton. I resolved to move forward on the opportunity and return forthwith to the [[Sacramento valley]] in order to bring to bear all the influence I could command.\"<ref>Fr\u00e9mont p. 490</ref>  Nevertheless, Fr\u00e9mont needed to be circumspect. As a military officer he could face [[court-martial]] for violating the [[Neutrality Act of 1794]] that made it illegal for an American to wage war against another country at peace with the United States. The next morning Gillespie and Fr\u00e9mont's group departed for California.  Fr\u00e9mont returned to the Sacramento Valley and set up camp near [[Sutter Buttes]].<ref>Harlow p. 85</ref>\n\n===USS ''Portsmouth'' in the San Francisco Bay===\n[[File:USS Portsmouth-Full Sail.jpg|150px|thumb|right|{{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}} supplied money, materiel, and supplies to the Bear Republic rebels.]]\n\nU.S. Consul [[Thomas O.

Sloat]] of U.S. Navy's [[Pacific Squadron]], for a warship to protect U.S. citizens and interests in [[Alta California]].  In response, the {{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}} arrived at [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] on April 22, 1846.   After receiving information about Fr\u00e9mont's returning to California, Consul Larkin and ''Portsmouth's'' captain [[John Berrien Montgomery]] decided the ship should move into the [[San Francisco Bay]]. She sailed from Monterey on June 1.<ref>Rogers ''Montgomery'' pp. 21\u201323</ref>\n\nLt. Gillespie, having returned from the [[Oregon Country]] and his meeting with Fr\u00e9mont on June 7, found ''Portsmouth'' moored at [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]].

Capt. Fremont invites every freeman in the valley to come to his camp at the Butts [sic], immediately; and he hopes to stay the enemy and put a stop to his\" \u2013 (Here the sheet was folded and worn in-two, and no more is found).<ref>Ide pp. 112\u20133</ref>  Ide and other settlers quickly traveled to Fr\u00e9mont's camp but were generally dissatisfied by the lack of a specific plan and their inability to obtain from Fr\u00e9mont any definite promise of aid.<ref>Bancroft V:104</ref>\n\n===Taking of government horses===\nSome of the group who had been meeting with Fr\u00e9mont departed from his camp and, on June 10, 1846, captured a herd of 170 Mexican government-owned horses being moved by ''[[Californio]]'' soldiers from San Rafael and Sonoma to the Californian ''Commandante General'', [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]], in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]].  It had been reported amongst the emigrants that the officer in charge of the herd had made statements threatening that the horses would be used by Castro to drive the foreigners out of California.  The captured horses were taken to Fr\u00e9mont's new camp at the junction of the Feather and Bear rivers.<ref>Bancroft V:101\u2013108</ref>\n\nThese men next determined to seize the ''pueblo'' of Sonoma to deny the ''Californios'' a rallying point north of [[San Francisco Bay]].<ref name=\"Bancroft V:109\">Bancroft V:109</ref>  Capturing both the arms and military materiel stored in the unmanned [[Presidio of Sonoma]] and Mexican Lieutenant Colonel [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]] would delay any military response from the ''Californios''.  The insurgent group was nominally led by Ezekiel \"Stuttering Zeke\" Merritt, whom Fr\u00e9mont described as his \"field-lieutenant\" and lauded for not questioning him.<ref>Fr\u00e9mont p. 509</ref><ref>CSMM</ref>\n\n===Capture of Sonoma===\n[[File:BearFlagMonument.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Bear Flag monument in [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] commemorating its capture by rebels]]\n\nHistorian George Tays has cautioned \"The description of the men, their actions just prior and subsequent to the taking of Sonoma, are as varied as the number of authors.  No two accounts agree, and it is impossible to determine the truth of their statements.\" <ref>Tays p.240 Note 1</ref> Historian H. H. Bancroft has written that Fr\u00e9mont \"instigated and planned\" the horse raid, and incited the American settlers indirectly and \"guardedly\" to revolt.<ref name=\"Walker p. 121\">Walker p. 121</ref>\n\nBefore dawn on Sunday, June 14, 1846, over 30 American insurgents arrived at the pueblo of Sonoma. They had traveled overnight from Napa Valley.  A majority of their number had started a couple of days earlier from Fremont's camp in the Sacramento valley but others had joined the group along the way. Meeting no resistance, they approached ''Comandante'' Vallejo's home and pounded on his door.  After a few minutes Vallejo opened the door dressed in his Mexican Army uniform.  Communication was not good until American [[Jacob P. Leese]] (Vallejo's brother-in-law) was summoned to translate.<ref>Harlow pp. 98\u201399</ref>\n\nVallejo then invited the [[Filibuster (military)|filibusters']] leaders into his home to negotiate terms.  Two other Californio officers and [[Jacob P. Leese|Leese]] joined the negotiations.  The insurgents waiting outside sent elected \"captains\" [[John Grigsby (soldier)|John Grigsby]] and [[William B. Ide|William Ide]] inside to speed the proceedings.  The effect of Vallejo's hospitality in the form of wine and brandy for the negotiators and someone else's barrel of ''[[aguardiente]]'' for those outside is debatable.  However, when the agreement was presented to those outside they refused to endorse it.  Rather than releasing the Mexican officers under parole they insisted they be held as hostages.  John Grigsby refused to remain as leader of the group, stating he had been deceived by Fr\u00e9mont.  William Ide gave an impassioned speech urging the rebels to stay in Sonoma and start a new republic.<ref>Walker pp. 125\u20136</ref>  Referring to the stolen horses Ide ended his oration with \"Choose ye this day what you will be!

Some young Californio ''vigilantes'' under Juan Padilla evaded the guards, aroused Vallejo and offered to help him escape.  Vallejo declined, wanting to avoid any bloodshed and anticipating that Fr\u00e9mont would release him on parole.<ref>Harlow p.101</ref>\n\nThe [[Sonoma Barracks]] became the headquarters for the remaining twenty-four rebels, who within a few days created their Bear Flag (see the \"Bear Flag\" section below). After the flag was raised [[Californio]]s called the insurgents ''Los Osos'' (The Bears) and \"Bear Flaggers\" because of their flag and in derision of their often scruffy appearance.  The rebels embraced the expression, and their uprising, which they originally called the ''Popular Movement'', became known as the ''Bear Flag Revolt''.<ref>SSHP p. 82</ref>  Henry L.

Ide wrote a proclamation announcing and explaining the reasons for the revolt during the night of June 14\u201315, 1846 (below).  There were additional copies and some more moderate versions (produced in both English and Spanish) distributed around northern California through June 18.<ref>Rogers, ''Ide'' p. 82, Appendix A</ref>\n{{Quotation\n|To all persons, citizens of Sonoma, requesting them to remain at peace, and to follow their rightful occupations without fear of molestation.\n\nThe Commander in Chief of the Troops assembled at the Fortress of Sonoma gives his inviolable pledge to all persons in California not found under arms that they shall not be disturbed in their persons, their property or social relations one to another by men under his command.\n\nHe also solemnly declares his object to be First, to defend himself and companions in arms who were invited to this country by a promise of Lands on which to settle themselves and families who were also promised a \"republican government,\" who, when having arrived in California were denied even the privilege of buying or renting Lands of their friends, who instead of being allowed to participate in or being protected by a \"Republican Government\" were oppressed by a \"Military Despotism,\" who were even threatened, by \"Proclamation\" from the Chief Officer of the aforesaid Despotism, with extermination if they would not depart out of the Country, leaving all of their property, their arms and beasts of burden, and thus deprived of the means of flight or defense. We were to be driven through deserts, inhabited by hostile Indians to certain destruction. To overthrow a Government which has seized upon the property of the Missions for its individual aggrandizement; which has ruined and shamefully oppressed the laboring people of California, by their enormous exactions on goods imported into this country; is the determined purpose of the brave men who are associated under his command.\n\nHe also solemnly declares his object in the Second place to be to invite all peaceable and good Citizens of California who are friendly to the maintenance of good order and equal rights (and I do hereby invite them to repair to my camp at Sonoma without delay) to assist us in establishing and perpetuating a \"Republican Government\" which shall secure to all: civil and religious liberty; which shall detect and punish crime; which shall encourage industry, virtue and literature; which shall leave unshackled by Fetters, Commerce, Agriculture, and Mechanism.\n\nHe further declares that he relies upon the rectitude of our intentions; the favor of Heaven and the bravery of those who are bound to and associated with him, by the principle of self preservation; by the love of truth; and by the hatred of tyranny for his hopes of success.\n\nHe further declares that he believes that a Government to be prosperous and happyfying [sic] in its tendency must originate with its people who are friendly to its existence. That its Citizens are its Guardians, its officers are its Servants, and its Glory their reward.  |William B. Ide|Head Quarters Sonoma|June 15, 1846\n}}\n\n===Need for gunpowder===\nA major problem for the Bears in Sonoma was the lack of sufficient [[gunpowder]] to defend against the expected Mexican attack.  William Todd was dispatched on Monday the fifteenth, with a letter<ref group=notes>{{cite web |url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/June%2015_1846%20William%20B%20Ide%20Letter%20to%20Stockton%20Montgomery.html |title=Ide's Letter |date= June 15, 1846}}</ref> to be delivered to the [[USS Portsmouth (1843)|USS ''Portsmouth'']] telling of the events in Sonoma and describing themselves as \"fellow country men\". Todd, having been instructed not to repeat any of the requests in the letter (refers to their need for gunpowder), disregarded that and voiced the request for gunpowder.  Captain Montgomery, while sympathetic, declined because of his country's neutrality.<ref>Bancroft V:156</ref>  Todd, Jos\u00e9 de Rosa (the messenger Vallejo sent to Montgomery), and U.S. Navy Lieutenant John S. Misroon returned to Sonoma in the Portsmouth's launch the morning of the 16th.  Misroon's mission was, without interfering with the revolt, to prevent violence to noncombatants.<ref>Harlow p. 104</ref>\n\nTodd was given a second assignment.  He was sent to Bodega Bay with an unnamed companion (sometimes called 'the Englishman') to obtain powder from American settlers in that area.<ref name=\"Walker p. 132\">Walker p. 132</ref>  On June 18, Bears Thomas Cowie and George Fowler were sent to ''Rancho Sotoyome'' (near current-day [[Healdsburg, California]]) to pick up a cache of gunpowder from Moses Carson, brother of Fr\u00e9mont's scout [[Kit Carson]].<ref>Bancroft pp. 155\u201359</ref>\n\n===Sutter's Fort===\n[[File:Sutter's Fort colored engraving 1849.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Sutter's Fort]] was one of two rebel strongholds, having been seized from John Sutter by John Fr\u00e9mont (c.  1849).]]\n\nFr\u00e9mont's \"field-lieutenant\" Merritt returned to Sacramento (known as New Helvetia at the time, so named by the Swiss John Sutter) on June 16 with his prisoners and recounted the events in Sonoma. Fr\u00e9mont either was fearful of going against the popular sentiment at Sonoma or saw the advantages of holding the ''Californio'' officers as hostages.  He also decided to imprison Governor Vallejo's brother-in-law, the American Jacob Leese, in [[Sutter's Fort]].<ref>Bancroft V:120\u201321</ref>  Fr\u00e9mont recounts in his memoirs, \"Affairs had now assumed a critical aspect and I presently saw that the time had come when it was unsafe to leave events to mature under unfriendly, or mistaken, direction \u2026 I knew the facts of the situation.

He issued two proclamations on June 17.  The first asked the citizens of California to come to the aid of their country.  The second promised protection for all foreigners not involved in the revolt.  A group of 50\u201360 militia under command of Captain [[Rancho Arroyo Seco (Torre)|Joaquin de la Torre]] traveled up to [[San Pablo, California|San Pablo]] and, by boat, westward across the [[San Francisco Bay]] to [[San Quentin, California|Point San Quentin]] on the 23rd.  Two additional divisions with a total of about 100 men arrived at San Pablo on June 27.<ref name=\"Bancroft V:132-136\">Bancroft V:132\u2013136</ref>\n\n===Battle of Ol\u00fampali===\nOn June 20 when the procurement parties failed to return as expected, Lieutenant Ford sent Sergeant Gibson with four men to ''Rancho Sotoyome''.  Gibson obtained the powder and on the way back fought with several Californians and captured one of them.  From the prisoner they learned that Cowie and Fowler had died.  There are [[Californio]] and ''Oso'' versions of what had happened.  Ford also learned that William Todd and his companion had been captured by the [[Californio]] irregulars led by Juan Padilla and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Carrillo.<ref name=\"Walker p. 132\"/>\n\nFord writes, in his biography, that before leaving Sonoma to search for the other two captives and Padilla's men, he sent a note to Ezekiel Merritt in Sacramento asking him to gather volunteers to help defend Sonoma.  Ide's version is that Ford wrote to Fr\u00e9mont saying that the Bears had lost confidence in Ide's leadership.  In either case, Ford then rode toward Santa Rosa with seventeen to nineteen Bears.  Not finding Padilla, the Bears headed toward one of his homes near [[Two Rock, California|Two Rock]].  The following morning the Bears captured three or four men near the [[Rancho Laguna de San Antonio]] and unexpectedly discovered what they assumed was Juan Padilla's group near the Indian rancho of [[Olumpali, California|Ol\u00fampali]].<ref name=\"Harlow p. 108-9\">Harlow pp. 108\u20139</ref>  Ford approached the adobe but more men appeared and others came \"pouring out of the adobe\".  Militiamen from south of the Bay, led by Mexican Captain Joaquin de la Torre, had joined with Padilla's irregulars and now numbered about seventy.  Ford's men positioned themselves in a grove of trees and opened fire when the enemy charged on horseback, killing one Californio and wounding another. During the ensuing [[Battle of Olompali|long-range battle]], William Todd and his companion escaped from the house where they were being held and ran to the Bears. The Californios disengaged from the long-range fighting after suffering a few wounded and returned to San Rafael.<ref>Rogers: Ide p.51</ref> A Californian militiaman reported that their muskets could not shoot as far as the rifles used by some Bears.<ref>Bancroft v:166 note 15</ref> This was the only battle fought during the Bear Flag Revolt.<ref>Walker pp. 132\u201335</ref>\n\nThe deaths of Cowie and Fowler, as well as the lethal battle, raised the anxiety of both the Californios, who left the area for safety, and the immigrants, who moved into Sonoma to be under the protection of the muskets and cannon that had been taken from the [[Sonoma Barracks]]. This increased the number in Sonoma to about two hundred.<ref name=\"Bancroft V:109\"/> Some immigrant families were housed in the Barracks, others in the homes of the Californios.<ref name=\"Harlow p. 108-9\"/><ref>Warner pp. 479\u2013482 Appendix VII</ref>\n\n===Fr\u00e9mont arrives to defend Sonoma===\n[[File:Historic American Buildings Survey George Gibbs Drawing of 1851 Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collection VIEW FROM WEST - Sonoma Plaza, Bear Flag Flagstaff, Sonoma, Sonoma County, CA HABS CAL,49-SONO,7-1.tif|300px|thumb|left|[[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] was a tiny Hispanic settlement in 1846, drawn here as it was in 1851.]]\n\nHaving learned of Ford's request for volunteers to defend Sonoma and hearing reports that General Castro was preparing an attack, Fr\u00e9mont left his camp near Sutter's Fort for Sonoma on June 23.  With him were ninety men \u2013 his own party plus trappers and settlers under Samuel J. Hensley.  Fr\u00e9mont would say in his memoirs that he wrote a letter of resignation from the Army and sent it to his father-in-law [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]] in case the government should wish to disavow his action.  They arrived at Sonoma in the early morning of the 25th and by noon were on their way to [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] accompanied by a contingent of Bears under Ford's command.  They arrived at the former San Rafael mission but the Californios had vanished.  The rebels set up camp in the old mission and sent out scouting parties.<ref>Harlow p, 108\u2013110</ref><ref>Walker pp. 134\u20135</ref>\n\nOn Sunday the 28th a small boat was spotted coming across the bay.  Kit Carson and some companions went to intercept it.  It held twin brothers Francisco and Ram\u00f3n de Haro, their uncle Jos\u00e9 de la Reyes Berreyesa, and an oarsman (probably one of the Castro brothers from San Pablo) \u2013 all unarmed.  The Haro brothers and Berreyesa were dropped off at the shoreline and started on foot for the mission.  All three were shot and killed.  Beyond that almost every fact is disputed.  Some say Fr\u00e9mont ordered the killings.  Others, that they were carrying secret messages from Castro to Torre.  Others that Carson committed the homicides as revenge for the deaths of Cowie and Fowler or they were shot by Fr\u00e9mont's Delaware Indians.  This incident became an issue in Fr\u00e9mont's later campaign for President.  Partisan eyewitnesses and newspapers related totally conflicting stories.<ref>Bancroft V:171\u20134</ref><ref>Harlow p.110</ref>\n\n===Captain de la Torre's ruse===\nLate the same afternoon as the killings a scouting party intercepted a letter indicating that Torre intended to attack Sonoma the following morning.  Fr\u00e9mont felt there was no choice but to return to defend Sonoma as quickly as possible.  The garrison there had found a similar letter and had all weapons loaded and at the ready before dawn the next day when Fr\u00e9mont and Ford's forces approached Sonoma \u2013 almost provoking firing by the garrison.  Fr\u00e9mont, understanding that he had been tricked, left again for San Rafael after a hasty breakfast.  He arrived back at the old mission within twenty-four hours of leaving but during that period Torre and his men had time to escape to San Pablo via boat.  Torre had successfully used the ruse not only to escape  but almost succeeded in provoking a 'friendly fire' incident among the insurgents.<ref>Bancroft V;174\u20136</ref>\n\nAfter reaching San Pablo, Torre reported that the combined rebel force was too strong to be attacked as planned.  All three of Castro's divisions then returned to the old headquarters near [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] where a council of war was held on June 30.  It was decided that the current plan must be abandoned and any new approach would require the cooperation of Pio Pico and his southern forces.  A messenger was sent to the Governor.  Meanwhile, the army moved southwards to [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan]] where General Castro was, on July 6, when he learned of the events in Monterey.<ref>Bancroft V:136</ref>\n\n===Actions in and around Yerba Buena===\nOn July 1, Fr\u00e9mont and twelve men convinced Captain William Phelps to ferry them in the ''Moscow'''s launch to the [[Fort Point, San Francisco|old Spanish fort]] at the entrance to the [[Golden Gate]].  They landed without resistance and spiked the ten old, abandoned cannon.  The next day [[Robert B. Semple]] led ten Bears in the launch to the pueblo of [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (the future San Francisco) to arrest the naturalized Englishman Robert Ridley who was captain of the port.  Ridley was sent to Sutter's Fort to be locked up with other prisoners.<ref>Harlow p. 111</ref>\n\n===Independence Day, 1846, in Sonoma===\n\nA great celebration was held on the [[Fourth of July]] beginning with readings of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in Sonoma's plaza.  There were also cannon salutes, the roasting of whole beeves, and the consumption of many foods and all manner of beverages.  Fr\u00e9mont and the contingent from San Rafael arrived in time for the [[fandango]] held in Salvador Vallejo's big adobe on the corner of the town square.<ref>Walker p. 138\u20139</ref>\n\n===Formation of the California Battalion===\n\nOn July 5, Fr\u00e9mont called a public meeting and proposed to the Bears that they unite with his party and form a single military unit.  He said that he would accept command if they would pledge obedience, proceed honorably, and not violate the chastity of women. A compact was drawn up which all volunteers of the [[California Battalion]] signed or made their marks.<ref>Bancroft V:178\u201380</ref> A majority of those present also agreed to officially date the era of independence not from the taking of Sonoma but from July 5 to allow Fr\u00e9mont to \"begin at the beginning\".<ref>Harlow p. 112</ref>\n\nThe next day Fr\u00e9mont, leaving the fifty men of Company B at the Barracks to defend Sonoma, left with the rest of the Battalion for Sutter's Fort. They took with them two of the captured Mexican field pieces, as well as muskets, a supply of ammunition, blankets, horses, and cattle.<ref>Bancroft V:184\u20135</ref>  The seven-ton ''Mermaid'' was used for transporting the cannon, arms, ammunition and saddles from Napa to Sutter's Fort.<ref>Rogers: Ide p. 56</ref>\n\n===U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps capture Monterey===\nWar against Mexico had already been declared by the United States Congress on May 13, 1846.  Because of the slow cross-continent communication of the time, no one in California knew that conclusively.  (Official notice of the war finally reached California on August 12, 1846.)<ref>Harlow p. 121</ref>  [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[John D. Sloat]], commanding the U.S. Navy's [[Pacific Squadron]], had been waiting in [[Monterey Bay]] since July 1 or 2 to obtain convincing proof of war.  Sloat was 65 years old and had requested to be relieved from his command the previous May.  He was also acutely aware of the 1842 [[Capture of Monterey]], when his predecessor, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]], thought war had been declared and captured the capital of Alta California, only to discover his error and abandon it the next day.  This resulted in diplomatic problems, and Jones was removed as commander of the Pacific Squadron.\n\nSloat had learned of Fr\u00e9mont's confrontation with the Californios on [[Fremont Peak (California)|Gavilan Peak]] and of his support for the Bears in Sonoma.  He was also aware of Lt. Gillespie's  tracking down of Fr\u00e9mont with letters and orders.  Sloat finally concluded on July 6 that he needed to act, saying to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin|Larkin]], \"I shall be blamed for doing too little or too much \u2013 I prefer the latter.\"<ref>Harlow p. 122</ref>  Early July 7, the [[frigate]] [[USS Savannah (1842)|USS ''Savannah'']] and the two [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]], [[USS Cyane (1837)|USS ''Cyane'']] and [[USS Levant (1837)|USS ''Levant'']] of the [[United States Navy]], captured [[Monterey, California]], and raised the flag of the United States.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/biographies/john_sloat.html \"Commodore John Sloat\"].

Montgomery]].  John E. wrote to his mother later in July that \"Cuffy came down growling\".  The following November, John and his older brother disappeared while traveling to Sacramento and were presumed deceased. Commander Montgomery kept the Bear Flag, had a copy made, and eventually both were delivered to the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]. In 1855 the Secretary sent both flags to the Senators from California who donated them to the Society of Pioneers in San Francisco.  The original Bear Flag was destroyed in the fires following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bear Flag Museum|title=History of the Bear Flag|url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}</ref> A replica, created in 1896 for the 50th Anniversary celebrations, is on display at the [[Sonoma Barracks]].\n\n==Bear Flag==\n{{main|Flag of California}}\n[[File:Original_Storm_bear_flag.jpeg|left|thumb|175px|The First [[Bear Flag]], by Peter Storm photographed ca 1870]]\n[[File:Original_Todd_bear_flag.jpg|left|thumb|175px|The original of Todd's [[Bear Flag]], photographed in 1890]]\n[[File:Flag of California.svg|right|thumb|175px|Modern flag of the State of California, for comparison]]\n\nThe most notable legacy of the \"California Republic\" was the adoption of its flag as the basis of the modern state [[Flag of California]].

Swift]], Peter Storm, and Henry L. Ford in an 1878 [http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/ToddinLAExpress1878.html newspaper article].   Todd painted the flag on domestic cotton cloth, roughly a yard and a half in length. It featured a red star based on the [[Flag of California#California Lone Star Flag|California Lone Star Flag]] that was flown during California's 1836 revolt led by [[Juan Bautista Alvarado|Juan Alvarado]] and [[Isaac Graham]].<ref name=\"flags over ca\">{{Cite book | title = Flags over California, A History and Guide| place = Sacramento | publisher = State of California, Military Department | year = 2002 | url = http://www.militarymuseum.org/Flags_Over_Ca.pdf}}</ref> The flag also featured an image of a grizzly bear [[Salient (heraldry)|salient]] or [[rampant]] (standing).

Fr\u00e9mont.  The [[Bear Flag Revolt]] and whatever remained of the \"California Republic\" ceased to exist on July 9 when U.S. Navy Lieutenant [[Joseph Warren Revere (general)|Joseph Revere]] raised the [[United States flag]] in front of the [[Sonoma Barracks]] and sent a second flag to be raised at [[Sutter's Fort]].<ref>Bancroft V: 185\u201386</ref>\n\n==Background of the Bear Flag Revolt==\n[[File:P\u00edo Pico cph.31737.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[P\u00edo Pico]] was territorial governor of Alta California south of [[San Luis Obispo]].]]\n\n===Alta California's Governance===\n\nBy 1845\u201346, Alta California had been largely neglected by [[Mexico]] for the twenty-five years since Mexican independence.  It had evolved into a semi-autonomous region with open discussions among [[Californio]]s about whether California should remain with Mexico; seek independence; or become annexed to the United Kingdom, France, or the United States. The 1845 removal of [[Manuel Micheltorena]], the latest governor to be sent by Mexico and forcefully ejected by the Californians, resulted in a divided government.  The region south of [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] was ruled by Governor [[P\u00edo Pico]] with his capital in ''The Town of Our Lady the Queen of Angels of the Porci\u00fancula River'', now known as  [[Los Angeles]].  The area to the north of the pueblo of [[San Luis Obispo, California|San Luis Obispo]] was under the control of Alta California's [[commander (rank)#Latin America|''Commandante'']] [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]] with headquarters near [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], the traditional capital and, significantly, the location of the [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|Customhouse]]. Pico and Castro disliked each other personally and soon began escalating disputes over control of the Customhouse income.<ref>Walker pp. 42\u201343</ref>\n\nDecrees issued by the central government in Mexico City were often acknowledged and supported with proclamations but ignored in practice.  By the end of 1845, when rumors of a military force being sent from Mexico proved to be false, rulings by the other district government were mostly ignored.<ref>Bancroft IV:540\u2013545</ref>\n\n===Texas, immigration and land===\n[[File:Polkpolk.jpg|175px|thumb|left|U.S. President [[James K. Polk]] favored expansionist policies that led to the annexation of Texas and California.]]\n\nThe relationship between the United States and Mexico had been deteriorating for some time.  The [[Republic of Texas]], which Mexico still considered to be its territory, had been admitted to statehood in 1845.<ref>Hague p 99</ref>  Mexico had earlier threatened war if this happened.<ref name=\"Walker p. 60\">Walker p. 60</ref>  [[James K. Polk]] was elected President of the United States in 1844, and considered his election a mandate for his expansionist policies.<ref>Walker p. 58</ref>\n\nMexican law had long allowed grants of land to [[naturalized]] Mexican citizens.  Obtaining Mexican citizenship was not difficult and many earlier American immigrants had gone through the process and obtained free grants of land.  That same year (1845) anticipation of war with the United States and the increasing number of immigrants reportedly coming from the United States resulted in orders from Mexico City denying immigrants from the United States entry into California.<ref>Hague p.118</ref>  The orders also required California's officials not to allow land grants, sales or even rental of land to non-citizen emigrants already in California.  All non-citizen immigrants, who had arrived without permission, were threatened with being forced out of California.<ref>Bancroft; IV:598\u2013608</ref>\n\nAlta California's Sub-Prefect [[Francisco Guerrero (politician)|Francisco Guerrero]] had written to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]] that:\n{{quote|a multitude of foreigners [having] come into California and bought fixed property [land], a right of [[Naturalization|naturalized foreigners]] only, he was under the necessity of notifying the authorities in each town to inform such purchasers that the transactions were invalid and they themselves subject to be expelled whenever the government might find it convenient.<ref name=\"Richman p 308\"/>}}\n\n[[File:Jose Castro.jpg|150px|thumb|right|California's ''Commandante General'' [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]] commanded Mexican military forces in Alta California.]]\n\nDuring November 1845, California's ''Commandante General'' Jos\u00e9 Castro met with representatives of the 1845 American immigrants at Sonoma and Sutter's Fort.  In his decree dated November 6 he wrote: \"Therefore conciliating my duty [to enforce the orders from Mexico] with of the sentiment of hospitality which distinguishes the Mexicans, and considering that most of said expedition is composed of families and industrious people, I have deemed it best to permit them, provisionally, to remain in the department\" with the conditions that they obey all laws, apply within three months for a license to settle, and promise to depart if that license was not granted.<ref>Bancroft IV: \npp. 606\u20137</ref>\n\n===Captain Fr\u00e9mont in California===\n[[File:John C. Fremont at National Portrait Gallery IMG 4410.JPG|175px|thumb|left|The rebellion was covertly encouraged by U.S. Army Brevet Captain [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]].]]\nA 62-man exploring and mapping expedition entered California in late 1845 under the command of U.S. Army Brevet Captain [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]]. Fr\u00e9mont was well known in the United States as an author and explorer. He was also the son-in-law of expansionist U.S. Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (senator)|Thomas Hart Benton]]. Early in 1846 Fr\u00e9mont acted provocatively with California's ''Commandante General'' Jos\u00e9 Castro near the pueblo of [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] and then moved his group out of California into [[Oregon Country]]. He was followed into Oregon by U.S. Marine Lt [[Archibald H. Gillespie]] who had been sent from Washington with a secret message to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]] and instructions to share the message with Fr\u00e9mont. Gillespie also brought a packet of letters from Fr\u00e9mont's wife and father-in-law.<ref>Hague p. 128</ref>\n\nFr\u00e9mont's thoughts (as related in his book, written forty years later) after reading the message and letters were: \"I saw the way opening clear before me.  War with Mexico was inevitable; and a grand opportunity presented itself to realize in their fullest extent the far-sighted views of Senator Benton. I resolved to move forward on the opportunity and return forthwith to the [[Sacramento valley]] in order to bring to bear all the influence I could command.\"<ref>Fr\u00e9mont p. 490</ref>  Nevertheless, Fr\u00e9mont needed to be circumspect. As a military officer he could face [[court-martial]] for violating the [[Neutrality Act of 1794]] that made it illegal for an American to wage war against another country at peace with the United States. The next morning Gillespie and Fr\u00e9mont's group departed for California.  Fr\u00e9mont returned to the Sacramento Valley and set up camp near [[Sutter Buttes]].<ref>Harlow p. 85</ref>\n\n===USS ''Portsmouth'' in the San Francisco Bay===\n[[File:USS Portsmouth-Full Sail.jpg|150px|thumb|right|{{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}} supplied money, materiel, and supplies to the Bear Republic rebels.]]\n\nU.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin]], concerned about the increasing possibility of war, sent a request to [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[John D. Sloat]] of U.S. Navy's [[Pacific Squadron]], for a warship to protect U.S. citizens and interests in [[Alta California]].  In response, the {{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}} arrived at [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] on April 22, 1846.   After receiving information about Fr\u00e9mont's returning to California, Consul Larkin and ''Portsmouth's'' captain [[John Berrien Montgomery]] decided the ship should move into the [[San Francisco Bay]]. She sailed from Monterey on June 1.<ref>Rogers ''Montgomery'' pp. 21\u201323</ref>\n\nLt. Gillespie, having returned from the [[Oregon Country]] and his meeting with Fr\u00e9mont on June 7, found ''Portsmouth'' moored at [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]]. He carried a request for money, materiel and supplies for Fr\u00e9mont's group.

Capt. Fremont invites every freeman in the valley to come to his camp at the Butts [sic], immediately; and he hopes to stay the enemy and put a stop to his\" \u2013 (Here the sheet was folded and worn in-two, and no more is found).<ref>Ide pp. 112\u20133</ref>  Ide and other settlers quickly traveled to Fr\u00e9mont's camp but were generally dissatisfied by the lack of a specific plan and their inability to obtain from Fr\u00e9mont any definite promise of aid.<ref>Bancroft V:104</ref>\n\n===Taking of government horses===\nSome of the group who had been meeting with Fr\u00e9mont departed from his camp and, on June 10, 1846, captured a herd of 170 Mexican government-owned horses being moved by ''[[Californio]]'' soldiers from San Rafael and Sonoma to the Californian ''Commandante General'', [[Jos\u00e9 Castro]], in [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]].  It had been reported amongst the emigrants that the officer in charge of the herd had made statements threatening that the horses would be used by Castro to drive the foreigners out of California.  The captured horses were taken to Fr\u00e9mont's new camp at the junction of the Feather and Bear rivers.<ref>Bancroft V:101\u2013108</ref>\n\nThese men next determined to seize the ''pueblo'' of Sonoma to deny the ''Californios'' a rallying point north of [[San Francisco Bay]].<ref name=\"Bancroft V:109\">Bancroft V:109</ref>  Capturing both the arms and military materiel stored in the unmanned [[Presidio of Sonoma]] and Mexican Lieutenant Colonel [[Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo]] would delay any military response from the ''Californios''.  The insurgent group was nominally led by Ezekiel \"Stuttering Zeke\" Merritt, whom Fr\u00e9mont described as his \"field-lieutenant\" and lauded for not questioning him.<ref>Fr\u00e9mont p. 509</ref><ref>CSMM</ref>\n\n===Capture of Sonoma===\n[[File:BearFlagMonument.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Bear Flag monument in [[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] commemorating its capture by rebels]]\n\nHistorian George Tays has cautioned \"The description of the men, their actions just prior and subsequent to the taking of Sonoma, are as varied as the number of authors.  No two accounts agree, and it is impossible to determine the truth of their statements.\" <ref>Tays p.240 Note 1</ref> Historian H. H. Bancroft has written that Fr\u00e9mont \"instigated and planned\" the horse raid, and incited the American settlers indirectly and \"guardedly\" to revolt.<ref name=\"Walker p. 121\">Walker p. 121</ref>\n\nBefore dawn on Sunday, June 14, 1846, over 30 American insurgents arrived at the pueblo of Sonoma. They had traveled overnight from Napa Valley.  A majority of their number had started a couple of days earlier from Fremont's camp in the Sacramento valley but others had joined the group along the way. Meeting no resistance, they approached ''Comandante'' Vallejo's home and pounded on his door.  After a few minutes Vallejo opened the door dressed in his Mexican Army uniform.  Communication was not good until American [[Jacob P. Leese]] (Vallejo's brother-in-law) was summoned to translate.<ref>Harlow pp. 98\u201399</ref>\n\nVallejo then invited the [[Filibuster (military)|filibusters']] leaders into his home to negotiate terms.  Two other Californio officers and [[Jacob P. Leese|Leese]] joined the negotiations.  The insurgents waiting outside sent elected \"captains\" [[John Grigsby (soldier)|John Grigsby]] and [[William B. Ide|William Ide]] inside to speed the proceedings.  The effect of Vallejo's hospitality in the form of wine and brandy for the negotiators and someone else's barrel of ''[[aguardiente]]'' for those outside is debatable.  However, when the agreement was presented to those outside they refused to endorse it.  Rather than releasing the Mexican officers under parole they insisted they be held as hostages.  John Grigsby refused to remain as leader of the group, stating he had been deceived by Fr\u00e9mont.  William Ide gave an impassioned speech urging the rebels to stay in Sonoma and start a new republic.<ref>Walker pp. 125\u20136</ref>  Referring to the stolen horses Ide ended his oration with \"Choose ye this day what you will be!  We are robbers, or we ''must'' be conquerors!\"<ref>Harlow p. 102</ref>\n\nAt that time, Vallejo and his three associates were placed on horseback and taken to Fr\u00e9mont accompanied by eight or nine of the insurgents who did not favor forming a new republic under the circumstances.<ref>Bancroft V:117</ref> That night they camped at the Vaca Rancho.  Some young Californio ''vigilantes'' under Juan Padilla evaded the guards, aroused Vallejo and offered to help him escape.  Vallejo declined, wanting to avoid any bloodshed and anticipating that Fr\u00e9mont would release him on parole.<ref>Harlow p.101</ref>\n\nThe [[Sonoma Barracks]] became the headquarters for the remaining twenty-four rebels, who within a few days created their Bear Flag (see the \"Bear Flag\" section below). After the flag was raised [[Californio]]s called the insurgents ''Los Osos'' (The Bears) and \"Bear Flaggers\" because of their flag and in derision of their often scruffy appearance.  The rebels embraced the expression, and their uprising, which they originally called the ''Popular Movement'', became known as the ''Bear Flag Revolt''.<ref>SSHP p. 82</ref>  Henry L. Ford was elected First Lieutenant of the company and obtained promises of obedience to orders.<ref name=\"Harlow p. 103\"/>  Samuel Kelsey was elected Second Lieutenant, Grandville P.

Ide wrote a proclamation announcing and explaining the reasons for the revolt during the night of June 14\u201315, 1846 (below).  There were additional copies and some more moderate versions (produced in both English and Spanish) distributed around northern California through June 18.<ref>Rogers, ''Ide'' p. 82, Appendix A</ref>\n{{Quotation\n|To all persons, citizens of Sonoma, requesting them to remain at peace, and to follow their rightful occupations without fear of molestation.\n\nThe Commander in Chief of the Troops assembled at the Fortress of Sonoma gives his inviolable pledge to all persons in California not found under arms that they shall not be disturbed in their persons, their property or social relations one to another by men under his command.\n\nHe also solemnly declares his object to be First, to defend himself and companions in arms who were invited to this country by a promise of Lands on which to settle themselves and families who were also promised a \"republican government,\" who, when having arrived in California were denied even the privilege of buying or renting Lands of their friends, who instead of being allowed to participate in or being protected by a \"Republican Government\" were oppressed by a \"Military Despotism,\" who were even threatened, by \"Proclamation\" from the Chief Officer of the aforesaid Despotism, with extermination if they would not depart out of the Country, leaving all of their property, their arms and beasts of burden, and thus deprived of the means of flight or defense. We were to be driven through deserts, inhabited by hostile Indians to certain destruction. To overthrow a Government which has seized upon the property of the Missions for its individual aggrandizement; which has ruined and shamefully oppressed the laboring people of California, by their enormous exactions on goods imported into this country; is the determined purpose of the brave men who are associated under his command.\n\nHe also solemnly declares his object in the Second place to be to invite all peaceable and good Citizens of California who are friendly to the maintenance of good order and equal rights (and I do hereby invite them to repair to my camp at Sonoma without delay) to assist us in establishing and perpetuating a \"Republican Government\" which shall secure to all: civil and religious liberty; which shall detect and punish crime; which shall encourage industry, virtue and literature; which shall leave unshackled by Fetters, Commerce, Agriculture, and Mechanism.\n\nHe further declares that he relies upon the rectitude of our intentions; the favor of Heaven and the bravery of those who are bound to and associated with him, by the principle of self preservation; by the love of truth; and by the hatred of tyranny for his hopes of success.\n\nHe further declares that he believes that a Government to be prosperous and happyfying [sic] in its tendency must originate with its people who are friendly to its existence. That its Citizens are its Guardians, its officers are its Servants, and its Glory their reward.  |William B. Ide|Head Quarters Sonoma|June 15, 1846\n}}\n\n===Need for gunpowder===\nA major problem for the Bears in Sonoma was the lack of sufficient [[gunpowder]] to defend against the expected Mexican attack.  William Todd was dispatched on Monday the fifteenth, with a letter<ref group=notes>{{cite web |url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/June%2015_1846%20William%20B%20Ide%20Letter%20to%20Stockton%20Montgomery.html |title=Ide's Letter |date= June 15, 1846}}</ref> to be delivered to the [[USS Portsmouth (1843)|USS ''Portsmouth'']] telling of the events in Sonoma and describing themselves as \"fellow country men\". Todd, having been instructed not to repeat any of the requests in the letter (refers to their need for gunpowder), disregarded that and voiced the request for gunpowder.  Captain Montgomery, while sympathetic, declined because of his country's neutrality.<ref>Bancroft V:156</ref>  Todd, Jos\u00e9 de Rosa (the messenger Vallejo sent to Montgomery), and U.S. Navy Lieutenant John S. Misroon returned to Sonoma in the Portsmouth's launch the morning of the 16th.  Misroon's mission was, without interfering with the revolt, to prevent violence to noncombatants.<ref>Harlow p. 104</ref>\n\nTodd was given a second assignment.  He was sent to Bodega Bay with an unnamed companion (sometimes called 'the Englishman') to obtain powder from American settlers in that area.<ref name=\"Walker p. 132\">Walker p. 132</ref>  On June 18, Bears Thomas Cowie and George Fowler were sent to ''Rancho Sotoyome'' (near current-day [[Healdsburg, California]]) to pick up a cache of gunpowder from Moses Carson, brother of Fr\u00e9mont's scout [[Kit Carson]].<ref>Bancroft pp. 155\u201359</ref>\n\n===Sutter's Fort===\n[[File:Sutter's Fort colored engraving 1849.jpg|250px|thumb|right|[[Sutter's Fort]] was one of two rebel strongholds, having been seized from John Sutter by John Fr\u00e9mont (c.  1849).]]\n\nFr\u00e9mont's \"field-lieutenant\" Merritt returned to Sacramento (known as New Helvetia at the time, so named by the Swiss John Sutter) on June 16 with his prisoners and recounted the events in Sonoma. Fr\u00e9mont either was fearful of going against the popular sentiment at Sonoma or saw the advantages of holding the ''Californio'' officers as hostages.  He also decided to imprison Governor Vallejo's brother-in-law, the American Jacob Leese, in [[Sutter's Fort]].<ref>Bancroft V:120\u201321</ref>  Fr\u00e9mont recounts in his memoirs, \"Affairs had now assumed a critical aspect and I presently saw that the time had come when it was unsafe to leave events to mature under unfriendly, or mistaken, direction \u2026 I knew the facts of the situation.

He issued two proclamations on June 17.  The first asked the citizens of California to come to the aid of their country.  The second promised protection for all foreigners not involved in the revolt.  A group of 50\u201360 militia under command of Captain [[Rancho Arroyo Seco (Torre)|Joaquin de la Torre]] traveled up to [[San Pablo, California|San Pablo]] and, by boat, westward across the [[San Francisco Bay]] to [[San Quentin, California|Point San Quentin]] on the 23rd.  Two additional divisions with a total of about 100 men arrived at San Pablo on June 27.<ref name=\"Bancroft V:132-136\">Bancroft V:132\u2013136</ref>\n\n===Battle of Ol\u00fampali===\nOn June 20 when the procurement parties failed to return as expected, Lieutenant Ford sent Sergeant Gibson with four men to ''Rancho Sotoyome''.  Gibson obtained the powder and on the way back fought with several Californians and captured one of them.  From the prisoner they learned that Cowie and Fowler had died.  There are [[Californio]] and ''Oso'' versions of what had happened.  Ford also learned that William Todd and his companion had been captured by the [[Californio]] irregulars led by Juan Padilla and Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Carrillo.<ref name=\"Walker p. 132\"/>\n\nFord writes, in his biography, that before leaving Sonoma to search for the other two captives and Padilla's men, he sent a note to Ezekiel Merritt in Sacramento asking him to gather volunteers to help defend Sonoma.  Ide's version is that Ford wrote to Fr\u00e9mont saying that the Bears had lost confidence in Ide's leadership.  In either case, Ford then rode toward Santa Rosa with seventeen to nineteen Bears.  Not finding Padilla, the Bears headed toward one of his homes near [[Two Rock, California|Two Rock]].  The following morning the Bears captured three or four men near the [[Rancho Laguna de San Antonio]] and unexpectedly discovered what they assumed was Juan Padilla's group near the Indian rancho of [[Olumpali, California|Ol\u00fampali]].<ref name=\"Harlow p. 108-9\">Harlow pp. 108\u20139</ref>  Ford approached the adobe but more men appeared and others came \"pouring out of the adobe\".  Militiamen from south of the Bay, led by Mexican Captain Joaquin de la Torre, had joined with Padilla's irregulars and now numbered about seventy.  Ford's men positioned themselves in a grove of trees and opened fire when the enemy charged on horseback, killing one Californio and wounding another. During the ensuing [[Battle of Olompali|long-range battle]], William Todd and his companion escaped from the house where they were being held and ran to the Bears. The Californios disengaged from the long-range fighting after suffering a few wounded and returned to San Rafael.<ref>Rogers: Ide p.51</ref> A Californian militiaman reported that their muskets could not shoot as far as the rifles used by some Bears.<ref>Bancroft v:166 note 15</ref> This was the only battle fought during the Bear Flag Revolt.<ref>Walker pp. 132\u201335</ref>\n\nThe deaths of Cowie and Fowler, as well as the lethal battle, raised the anxiety of both the Californios, who left the area for safety, and the immigrants, who moved into Sonoma to be under the protection of the muskets and cannon that had been taken from the [[Sonoma Barracks]]. This increased the number in Sonoma to about two hundred.<ref name=\"Bancroft V:109\"/> Some immigrant families were housed in the Barracks, others in the homes of the Californios.<ref name=\"Harlow p. 108-9\"/><ref>Warner pp. 479\u2013482 Appendix VII</ref>\n\n===Fr\u00e9mont arrives to defend Sonoma===\n[[File:Historic American Buildings Survey George Gibbs Drawing of 1851 Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collection VIEW FROM WEST - Sonoma Plaza, Bear Flag Flagstaff, Sonoma, Sonoma County, CA HABS CAL,49-SONO,7-1.tif|300px|thumb|left|[[Sonoma, California|Sonoma]] was a tiny Hispanic settlement in 1846, drawn here as it was in 1851.]]\n\nHaving learned of Ford's request for volunteers to defend Sonoma and hearing reports that General Castro was preparing an attack, Fr\u00e9mont left his camp near Sutter's Fort for Sonoma on June 23.  With him were ninety men \u2013 his own party plus trappers and settlers under Samuel J. Hensley.  Fr\u00e9mont would say in his memoirs that he wrote a letter of resignation from the Army and sent it to his father-in-law [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]] in case the government should wish to disavow his action.  They arrived at Sonoma in the early morning of the 25th and by noon were on their way to [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] accompanied by a contingent of Bears under Ford's command.  They arrived at the former San Rafael mission but the Californios had vanished.  The rebels set up camp in the old mission and sent out scouting parties.<ref>Harlow p, 108\u2013110</ref><ref>Walker pp. 134\u20135</ref>\n\nOn Sunday the 28th a small boat was spotted coming across the bay.  Kit Carson and some companions went to intercept it.  It held twin brothers Francisco and Ram\u00f3n de Haro, their uncle Jos\u00e9 de la Reyes Berreyesa, and an oarsman (probably one of the Castro brothers from San Pablo) \u2013 all unarmed.  The Haro brothers and Berreyesa were dropped off at the shoreline and started on foot for the mission.  All three were shot and killed.  Beyond that almost every fact is disputed.  Some say Fr\u00e9mont ordered the killings.  Others, that they were carrying secret messages from Castro to Torre.  Others that Carson committed the homicides as revenge for the deaths of Cowie and Fowler or they were shot by Fr\u00e9mont's Delaware Indians.  This incident became an issue in Fr\u00e9mont's later campaign for President.  Partisan eyewitnesses and newspapers related totally conflicting stories.<ref>Bancroft V:171\u20134</ref><ref>Harlow p.110</ref>\n\n===Captain de la Torre's ruse===\nLate the same afternoon as the killings a scouting party intercepted a letter indicating that Torre intended to attack Sonoma the following morning.  Fr\u00e9mont felt there was no choice but to return to defend Sonoma as quickly as possible.  The garrison there had found a similar letter and had all weapons loaded and at the ready before dawn the next day when Fr\u00e9mont and Ford's forces approached Sonoma \u2013 almost provoking firing by the garrison.  Fr\u00e9mont, understanding that he had been tricked, left again for San Rafael after a hasty breakfast.  He arrived back at the old mission within twenty-four hours of leaving but during that period Torre and his men had time to escape to San Pablo via boat.  Torre had successfully used the ruse not only to escape  but almost succeeded in provoking a 'friendly fire' incident among the insurgents.<ref>Bancroft V;174\u20136</ref>\n\nAfter reaching San Pablo, Torre reported that the combined rebel force was too strong to be attacked as planned.  All three of Castro's divisions then returned to the old headquarters near [[Santa Clara, California|Santa Clara]] where a council of war was held on June 30.  It was decided that the current plan must be abandoned and any new approach would require the cooperation of Pio Pico and his southern forces.  A messenger was sent to the Governor.  Meanwhile, the army moved southwards to [[San Juan Bautista, California|San Juan]] where General Castro was, on July 6, when he learned of the events in Monterey.<ref>Bancroft V:136</ref>\n\n===Actions in and around Yerba Buena===\nOn July 1, Fr\u00e9mont and twelve men convinced Captain William Phelps to ferry them in the ''Moscow'''s launch to the [[Fort Point, San Francisco|old Spanish fort]] at the entrance to the [[Golden Gate]].  They landed without resistance and spiked the ten old, abandoned cannon.  The next day [[Robert B. Semple]] led ten Bears in the launch to the pueblo of [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]] (the future San Francisco) to arrest the naturalized Englishman Robert Ridley who was captain of the port.  Ridley was sent to Sutter's Fort to be locked up with other prisoners.<ref>Harlow p. 111</ref>\n\n===Independence Day, 1846, in Sonoma===\n\nA great celebration was held on the [[Fourth of July]] beginning with readings of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] in Sonoma's plaza.  There were also cannon salutes, the roasting of whole beeves, and the consumption of many foods and all manner of beverages.  Fr\u00e9mont and the contingent from San Rafael arrived in time for the [[fandango]] held in Salvador Vallejo's big adobe on the corner of the town square.<ref>Walker p. 138\u20139</ref>\n\n===Formation of the California Battalion===\n\nOn July 5, Fr\u00e9mont called a public meeting and proposed to the Bears that they unite with his party and form a single military unit.  He said that he would accept command if they would pledge obedience, proceed honorably, and not violate the chastity of women. A compact was drawn up which all volunteers of the [[California Battalion]] signed or made their marks.<ref>Bancroft V:178\u201380</ref> A majority of those present also agreed to officially date the era of independence not from the taking of Sonoma but from July 5 to allow Fr\u00e9mont to \"begin at the beginning\".<ref>Harlow p. 112</ref>\n\nThe next day Fr\u00e9mont, leaving the fifty men of Company B at the Barracks to defend Sonoma, left with the rest of the Battalion for Sutter's Fort. They took with them two of the captured Mexican field pieces, as well as muskets, a supply of ammunition, blankets, horses, and cattle.<ref>Bancroft V:184\u20135</ref>  The seven-ton ''Mermaid'' was used for transporting the cannon, arms, ammunition and saddles from Napa to Sutter's Fort.<ref>Rogers: Ide p. 56</ref>\n\n===U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps capture Monterey===\nWar against Mexico had already been declared by the United States Congress on May 13, 1846.  Because of the slow cross-continent communication of the time, no one in California knew that conclusively.  (Official notice of the war finally reached California on August 12, 1846.)<ref>Harlow p. 121</ref>  [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[John D. Sloat]], commanding the U.S. Navy's [[Pacific Squadron]], had been waiting in [[Monterey Bay]] since July 1 or 2 to obtain convincing proof of war.  Sloat was 65 years old and had requested to be relieved from his command the previous May.  He was also acutely aware of the 1842 [[Capture of Monterey]], when his predecessor, [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Thomas ap Catesby Jones]], thought war had been declared and captured the capital of Alta California, only to discover his error and abandon it the next day.  This resulted in diplomatic problems, and Jones was removed as commander of the Pacific Squadron.\n\nSloat had learned of Fr\u00e9mont's confrontation with the Californios on [[Fremont Peak (California)|Gavilan Peak]] and of his support for the Bears in Sonoma.  He was also aware of Lt. Gillespie's  tracking down of Fr\u00e9mont with letters and orders.  Sloat finally concluded on July 6 that he needed to act, saying to U.S. Consul [[Thomas O. Larkin|Larkin]], \"I shall be blamed for doing too little or too much \u2013 I prefer the latter.\"<ref>Harlow p. 122</ref>  Early July 7, the [[frigate]] [[USS Savannah (1842)|USS ''Savannah'']] and the two [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]], [[USS Cyane (1837)|USS ''Cyane'']] and [[USS Levant (1837)|USS ''Levant'']] of the [[United States Navy]], captured [[Monterey, California]], and raised the flag of the United States.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/biographies/john_sloat.html \"Commodore John Sloat\"].

Montgomery]].  John E. wrote to his mother later in July that \"Cuffy came down growling\".  The following November, John and his older brother disappeared while traveling to Sacramento and were presumed deceased. Commander Montgomery kept the Bear Flag, had a copy made, and eventually both were delivered to the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]. In 1855 the Secretary sent both flags to the Senators from California who donated them to the Society of Pioneers in San Francisco.  The original Bear Flag was destroyed in the fires following the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bear Flag Museum|title=History of the Bear Flag|url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/|accessdate=May 18, 2014}}</ref> A replica, created in 1896 for the 50th Anniversary celebrations, is on display at the [[Sonoma Barracks]].\n\n==Bear Flag==\n{{main|Flag of California}}\n[[File:Original_Storm_bear_flag.jpeg|left|thumb|175px|The First [[Bear Flag]], by Peter Storm photographed ca 1870]]\n[[File:Original_Todd_bear_flag.jpg|left|thumb|175px|The original of Todd's [[Bear Flag]], photographed in 1890]]\n[[File:Flag of California.svg|right|thumb|175px|Modern flag of the State of California, for comparison]]\n\nThe most notable legacy of the \"California Republic\" was the adoption of its flag as the basis of the modern state [[Flag of California]].

Todd (1818\u20131879) wrote an account of the Bear Flag used at the storming of Sonoma, perhaps the first to be raised.<ref>[http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&d=LAH18780113.2.3&srpos=5&e=--1878---1879-187-en--20--1-byDA-txt-txIN-Bear+flag-------1 \"A Note from the Painter of the Original Bear Flag,\" Los Angeles Herald, Volume 9, Number 41, 13 January 1878].</ref> Soon after, his implementation became the basis for the first official State flag.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/JHusseyArticle.html |title=Bear Flag Museum| accessdate= June 13, 2008}}</ref>  Todd acknowledged the contributions of other ''Osos'' to the flag, including [[Granville P. Swift]], Peter Storm, and Henry L. Ford in an 1878 [http://www.bearflagmuseum.org/ToddinLAExpress1878.html newspaper article].   Todd painted the flag on domestic cotton cloth, roughly a yard and a half in length. It featured a red star based on the [[Flag of California#California Lone Star Flag|California Lone Star Flag]] that was flown during California's 1836 revolt led by [[Juan Bautista Alvarado|Juan Alvarado]] and [[Isaac Graham]].<ref name=\"flags over ca\">{{Cite book | title = Flags over California, A History and Guide| place = Sacramento | publisher = State of California, Military Department | year = 2002 | url = http://www.militarymuseum.org/Flags_Over_Ca.pdf}}</ref> The flag also featured an image of a grizzly bear [[Salient (heraldry)|salient]] or [[rampant]] (standing).
