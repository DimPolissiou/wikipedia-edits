When he was 14, he secured an apprenticeship with his uncle John Pegg, and spent five years as a cabinet maker.<ref name=\"aw_golden_age\" />\n\nCook was brought up as a strict [[Baptists|Baptist]]. In February 1826,  he became a Baptist missionary and toured the region as a village evangelist, distributing pamphlets and occasionally working as a cabinet maker to earn money.<ref name=\"aw_golden_age\"/>\n\nIn 1832, Cook moved to Adam and Eve Street in [[Market Harborough]]. Influenced by the local Baptist minister Francis Beardsall, he took the [[temperance movement|temperance]] pledge on New Year's Day in 1833.

Cromwell had hoped that the marriage would breathe fresh life into the Reformation in England, but Henry found his new bride unattractive and it turned into a disaster for Cromwell, ending in an annulment six months later.

It is believed that he was born at the top of Putney Hill, on the edge of [[Putney Heath]].  In 1878, his birthplace was still of note:\n<blockquote>The site of Cromwell's birthplace is still pointed out by tradition and is in some measure confirmed by the survey of Wimbledon Manor, quoted above, for it describes on that spot 'an ancient cottage called the smith's shop, lying west of the highway from Richmond to Wandsworth, being the sign of the Anchor'.

At the centre of the campaign to secure the annulment was the emerging doctrine of royal supremacy over the church. By the autumn of 1531, Cromwell had taken control of the supervision of the king's legal and parliamentary affairs, working closely with [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Thomas Audley]], and had joined the inner circle of the Council. By the following spring, he had begun to exert influence over elections to the House of Commons.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nThe third session of what is now known as the [[English Reformation Parliament|Reformation Parliament]] had been scheduled for October 1531, but was postponed until 15 January 1532 because of government indecision as to the best way to proceed. Cromwell now favoured the assertion of royal supremacy, and manipulated the Commons by resurrecting anti-clerical grievances expressed earlier in the session of 1529. On 18 March 1532, the Commons delivered a supplication to the king, denouncing clerical abuses and the power of the ecclesiastical courts, and describing Henry as \"the only head, sovereign lord, protector and defender\" of the Church. The clergy resisted the Act of 1529 where they were prevented from appealing to Church-established courts, or [[Ecclesiastical court]] to settle disputes. Instead they were forced to go through the public courts as lay people.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} The clergy capitulated when faced with the threat of parliamentary reprisal. On 14 May 1532, Parliament was [[prorogued]]. Two days later, [[Sir Thomas More]] resigned as [[Lord Chancellor]], realising that the battle to save the marriage was lost. More's resignation from the Council represented a triumph for Cromwell and the pro-Reformation faction at court.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nThe king's gratitude to Cromwell was expressed in a grant of the lordship of Romney{{clarify|date=April 2016}} in Newport, Wales, and appointment to three relatively minor offices: [[Master of the Jewel Office|Master of the Jewels]] on 14 April 1532, Clerk of the [[Hanaper]] on 16 July, and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] on 12 April 1533. None of these offices afforded much income, but the appointments were an indication of royal favour, and gave Cromwell a position in three major institutions of government: the royal household, the Chancery, and the Exchequer.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n[[File:Anneboleyn2.jpg|thumbnail|[[Anne Boleyn]]]]\n\nOn 26 January 1533, Audley was appointed Lord Chancellor, and <!--on the same day?-->Cromwell increased his control over the Commons through his management of by-elections. Henry and Anne married on 25 January 1533, after a secret marriage on 14 November 1532 that historians believe took place in Calais. On 23 May 1533, newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void; five days later, he declared Henry and Anne's marriage valid.\n\nThe parliamentary session began on 4 February, and Cromwell introduced a new bill restricting the right to make appeals to Rome. On 30 March, Cranmer was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury, and [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocation]] immediately declared the king's marriage to Catherine unlawful. In the first week of April 1533, Parliament passed Cromwell's bill into law, as the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals|Act in Restraint of Appeals]], ensuring that any verdict concerning the king's marriage could not be challenged in Rome. On 11 April, Archbishop Cranmer sent the King a pro forma challenge to the validity of his marriage to Catherine. A formal trial began on 10 May 1533 in Dunstable and on 23 May the Archbishop pronounced sentence, declaring the marriage illegal. Five days later he pronounced the King's marriage to Anne to be lawful, and on 1 June, she was crowned queen.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nIn December, the King authorised Cromwell to discredit the papacy and the Pope was attacked throughout the nation in sermons and pamphlets. In 1534 a new Parliament was summoned, again under Cromwell's supervision, to enact the legislation necessary to make a formal break of England's remaining ties with Rome. Archbishop Cranmer's sentence took statutory form as the Act of Succession, the Dispensations Act reiterated royal supremacy and the Act for the Submission of the Clergy incorporated into law the clergy's surrender in 1532. On 30 March 1534, Audley gave royal assent to the legislation in the presence of the King.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n==King's chief minister==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2014}}\nIn April 1534, Henry confirmed Cromwell as his principal secretary and chief minister, a position which he had held for some time in all but name. Cromwell immediately took steps to enforce the legislation just passed by Parliament. Before the members of both houses returned home on 30 March, they were required to swear an oath accepting the Act of Succession, and all the King's subjects were now required to swear to the legitimacy of the marriage and, by implication, to accept the King's new powers and the break from Rome. On 13 April, the London clergy accepted the oath. On the same day, the commissioners offered it to Sir Thomas More and [[John Fisher]], Bishop of Rochester, both of whom refused it. More was taken into custody on the same day and was moved to the Tower of London on 17 April. Fisher joined him there four days later.\n\nOn 18 April, an order was issued that all citizens of London were to swear. Similar orders were issued throughout the country. When Parliament reconvened in November, Cromwell brought in the most significant revision of the treason laws since 1352, making it treasonous to speak rebellious words against the Royal Family, to deny their titles, or to call the King a heretic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper. The Act of Supremacy also clarified the King's position as head of the church and the Act for Payment of First Fruits and Tenths substantially increased clerical taxes. Cromwell also strengthened his own control over the Church. On 21 January 1535, the King appointed him Royal Vicegerent and Vicar-General, and commissioned him to organise visitations of all the country's churches, monasteries, and clergy. In this capacity, Cromwell conducted a census in 1535 to enable the government to tax church property more effectively.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n===Fall of Anne Boleyn===\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Jane Seymour]] by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]\nThe final session of the Reformation Parliament began on 4 February 1536. By 18 March, an Act for the Suppression of the Lesser Monasteries, those with a gross income of less than \u00a3200 per annum, had passed both houses. This caused a clash with Anne Boleyn, formerly one of Cromwell's strongest allies, who wanted the proceeds of the dissolution used for educational and charitable purposes, not paid into the King's coffers.<ref>Eric Ives \"the Life and Death of Anne Boleyn\"</ref>\n\nAnne instructed her chaplains to preach against the Vicegerent, and in a blistering sermon on Passion Sunday, 2 April 1536, her [[almoner]], [[John Skip]], denounced Cromwell and his fellow Privy Councillors before the entire court. Skip's diatribe was intended to persuade courtiers and Privy Councillors to change the advice they had been giving the King and to reject the temptation of personal gain. Skip was called before the Council and accused of malice, slander, presumption, lack of charity, sedition, treason, disobedience to the gospel, attacking 'the great posts, pillars and columns sustaining and holding up the commonwealth' and inviting anarchy.{{sfn|Ives|2005|pp=307\u2013310}}{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=176\u2013179}}\n\nAnne, who had many enemies at court, had never been popular with the people and had so far failed to produce a male heir. The King was growing impatient, having become enamoured of the young [[Jane Seymour]] and encouraged by Anne's enemies, particularly Nicholas Carew and the Seymours. In circumstances that have divided historians, Anne was accused of adultery with [[Mark Smeaton]], a musician of the royal household, [[Henry Norris (courtier)|Henry Norris]], the King's groom of the stool and one of his closest friends, Sir [[Francis Weston]], [[William Brereton (groom)|William Brereton]] and her brother, [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford|Viscount Rochford]].{{sfn|Lipscomb|April 2013|pp=18\u201324}}{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=192\u2013205}} The Imperial Ambassador, [[Eustace Chapuys]], wrote to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] that: <blockquote>he himself [Cromwell] has been authorised and commissioned by the king to prosecute and bring to an end the mistress's trial, to do which he had taken considerable trouble...

The men were executed on 17 May 1536 and, on the same day, Cranmer declared Henry's marriage to Anne invalid, a ruling that illegitimised their daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]]. Two days later, Anne herself was executed. On 30 May, the King married Jane Seymour. On 8 June, a new Parliament passed the second Act of Succession, securing the rights of Queen Jane's heirs to the throne.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n===Baron Cromwell and Lord Privy Seal===\n[[File:Coat of arms of Sir Thomas Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell, KG.png|thumb|220px|Cromwell's arms as they were before his son's marriage to the queen's sister.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|pp=38\u20139, note 81}}]]\nCromwell's position was now stronger than ever. He succeeded Anne Boleyn's father, [[Thomas Boleyn, 1st Earl of Wiltshire]], as [[Lord Privy Seal]] on 2 July 1536, resigning the office of [[Master of the Rolls]], which he had held since 8 October 1534.

This resulted in the dispersal and destruction of many books deemed \"popish\" and \"superstitious\". This has been described as \"easily the greatest single disaster in English literary history\". [[Oxford University]] was left without a library collection until Sir Thomas Bodley's donation in 1602.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SochIc9cRGQC&pg=PT58|title=Mediaeval Education and the Reformation|author=John Lawson|date=15 April 2013|accessdate=17 November 2015|isbn=9781135031091}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1536, the first attempt was made to clarify religious doctrine after the break with Rome. Bishop [[Edward Foxe]] tabled proposals in Convocation, with strong backing from Cromwell and Cranmer, which the King later endorsed as the [[Ten Articles]] and which were printed in August 1536. Cromwell circulated injunctions for their enforcement that went beyond the Articles themselves, provoking opposition in September and October in [[Lincolnshire]] and then throughout the six northern counties. These widespread popular and clerical uprisings found support among the gentry and even the nobility; they were collectively known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The pilgrimage of grace and the politics of the 1530s|last=Hoyle, R.

One of the leaders of the rebellion was [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Darcy]], who gave Cromwell the prophetic warning (just prior to his execution) \"others that have been in such favour with kings as you now enjoy have come to the same fate you bring me to\".{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n[[File:Thomas Cromwell medal, 1538 side 2.png|thumbnail|right|Portrait medal made for Thomas Cromwell in 1538.

In February 1537, Cromwell convened a [[vicegerent]]ial [[synod]] of bishops and doctors. The synod was co-ordinated by Cranmer and Foxe, and they prepared a draft document by July: ''[[The Institution of a Christian Man]]'', more commonly known as the [[Bishops' Book]]. By October, it was in circulation, although the King had not yet given it his full assent. However, Cromwell's success in Church politics was offset by the fact that his political influence had been weakened by the emergence of a [[Privy Council]], a body of nobles and office-holders that first came together to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace. The King confirmed his support of Cromwell by appointing him to the [[Order of the Garter]] on 5 August 1537, but Cromwell was nonetheless forced to accept the existence of an executive body dominated by his conservative opponents.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nIn January 1538, Cromwell pursued an extensive campaign against what was termed \"idolatry\" by the followers of the old religion. Statues, [[rood screen]]s, and images were attacked, culminating in September with the dismantling of the shrine of St. [[Thomas Becket]] at Canterbury. Early in September, Cromwell also completed a new set of vicegerential injunctions declaring open war on \"pilgrimages, feigned relics or images, or any such superstitions\" and commanding that \"one book of the whole Bible in English\" be set up in every church. Moreover, following the \"voluntary\" surrender of the remaining smaller monasteries during the previous year, the larger monasteries were now also \"invited\" to surrender throughout 1538, a process legitimised in the 1539 session of Parliament and completed in the following year.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n====Resistance to further religious reform====\nThe King was becoming increasingly unhappy about the extent of religious changes, and the conservative faction was gaining strength at court. Cromwell took the initiative against his enemies. He imprisoned the [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], [[Sir Edward Neville]], and Sir [[Nicholas Carew (courtier)|Nicholas Carew]] on charges of treason in November 1538, using evidence acquired from [[Sir Geoffrey Pole]] under interrogation in the Tower. All were executed in the following months.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nOn 17 December 1538, the Inquisitor-General of France forbade the printing of [[Miles Coverdale]]'s [[Great Bible]]. Cromwell persuaded the King of France to release the unfinished books so that printing could continue in England. The first edition was finally available in April 1539. The publication of the Great Bible was one of Cromwell's principal achievements, the first authoritative version in English.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nThe King, however, continued to resist further Reformation measures. A Parliamentary committee was established to examine doctrine, and the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] presented six questions on 16 May 1539 for the House to consider, which were duly passed as the Act of [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]] shortly before the session ended on 28 June. The Six Articles reaffirmed a traditional view of the Mass, the Sacraments, and the priesthood.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n===Anne of Cleves===\n[[File:Anne of Cleves, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|''[[Anne of Cleves]]'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], c. 1539]]\n\nQueen Jane had died in 1537, less than two weeks after the birth of her only child, the future [[Edward VI]]. In early October 1539, the King finally accepted Cromwell's suggestion that he should marry [[Anne of Cleves]], the sister of [[William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke Wilhelm]] of [[United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Cleves]], partly on the basis of a portrait which [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] had painted of her. On 27 December, Anne of Cleves arrived at Dover. On New Year's Day 1540, the King met her at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] and was immediately repelled by her physically: \"I like her not!\" The wedding ceremony took place on 6 January at Greenwich, but the marriage was not consummated. Henry said that he found it impossible to enjoy conjugal relations with a woman whom he found so unattractive.{{sfn|Weir|1991|pp=377\u201378, 386\u201388, 395, 405, 410\u201311}}\n\n===Earl of Essex===\nOn 18 April 1540, Henry granted Cromwell the [[Earl of Essex|earldom of Essex]] and the senior Court office of [[Lord Great Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Despite these signs of royal favour, Cromwell's tenure as the King's chief minister was almost over. The King's anger at being forced to marry Anne of Cleves was the opportunity Cromwell's conservative opponents, most notably the Duke of Norfolk, needed to topple him.{{sfn|Weir|1991|pp=412, 418}}\n\n=== Downfall and execution===\nDuring 1536 Cromwell had proven himself an adept political survivor. However, the gradual slide towards Protestantism at home and the King's ill-starred marriage to [[Anne of Cleves]], which Cromwell engineered in January 1540, proved costly. Some historians believe that [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was partly responsible for Cromwell's downfall because he had provided a very flattering portrait of Anne which may have deceived the king. (The 65 \u00d7 48&nbsp;cm painting is now displayed at the [[Louvre]] in Paris.) When Henry finally met her, the king was reportedly shocked by her plain appearance.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Z15sBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&dq=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+downfall#v=onepage&q=cromwell+anne+of+cleves+downfall&f=false|title=England Under the Tudors|first=G.

In 1536, he established the [[Court of Augmentations]] to handle the massive windfall to the royal coffers from the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Two other important financial institutions, the [[Court of Wards and Liveries|Court of Wards]] and the [[Court of First Fruits and Tenths]], owed their existence to him, although they were not set up until after his death. He strengthened royal authority in the north of England, through reform of the [[Council of the North]], extended royal power and introduced Protestantism in Ireland, and was the architect of the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]], which promoted stability and gained acceptance for the royal supremacy in Wales. He also introduced important social and economic reforms in England in the 1530s, including action against [[enclosure]]s, the promotion of English cloth exports and the [[poor relief]] legislation of 1536.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n==Personal religious beliefs==\nAlthough Cromwell always maintained a primarily political outlook on general affairs, there is consensus among scholars that at least while he held power he was a Protestant, with a Lutheran mindset. For him, the [[Henrician Reformation]] was certainly more than a jurisdictional revolution masquerading in religious garb. For instance, in the mid-1530s, he promoted Protestant ideas to forge an alliance with German Lutheran states, but his support for the Protestant cause is too general to be accurately explained in narrow political terms.<ref>William Underwood, \"Thomas Cromwell and William Marshall's Protestant books\".

Phillips. He is depicted here as totally ruthless and unscrupulous.\n* Cromwell is the main antagonist in [[Robert Bolt]]'s play ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]'', in which he is portrayed as ruthlessly ambitious and jealous of Sir Thomas More's influence with the King. Cromwell was played by [[Andrew Keir]] when the play opened in London, and by [[Leo McKern]] on Broadway.\n* Cromwell was portrayed by John Dougall in [[Shakespeare's Globe]]'s production of ''[[Anne Boleyn (play)|Anne Boleyn]]'' by [[Howard Brenton]] in 2010, and Julius D'Silva in 2011.\n*Cromwell was portrayed in ''Henry VIII The Musical'', a youth production that premi\u00e8red in London in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Henry VIII The Musical|url=http://www.henryviiithemusical.com|publisher=Henryviiithemusical.com|accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref>\n*In 2014 the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] staged an adaptation by [[Mike Poulton]] of Dame [[Hilary Mantel]]'s first two Cromwell novels.

and statesman who served as chief minister to King [[Henry VIII of England]] from 1532 to 1540, when he was beheaded on orders of the king.\n\nCromwell was one of the strongest and most powerful proponents of the [[English Reformation]]. He helped to engineer an annulment of the king's marriage to [[Catherine of Aragon]] so that Henry could lawfully marry [[Anne Boleyn]]. Henry failed to obtain [[Pope Clement VII|the Pope]]'s approval for the [[annulment]] in 1534, so Parliament endorsed the king's claim to be [[Supreme Head of the Church of England]], giving him the authority to annul his own marriage. However, Cromwell subsequently charted an evangelical and reformist course for the [[Church of England]] from the unique posts of [[Vicegerent]] in Spirituals and [[vicar-general]].<ref name=\"Logan (1988)\">Logan argues that these titles refer to a single position. {{cite journal|author1=F.

Cromwell had hoped that the marriage would breathe fresh life into the Reformation in England, but Henry found his new bride unattractive and it turned into a disaster for Cromwell, ending in an annulment six months later. Cromwell was [[arraignment|arraigned]] under a [[bill of attainder]] and executed for [[treason]] and [[heresy]] on [[Tower Hill]] on 28 July 1540. The king later expressed regret at the loss of his chief minister.{{sfn|Hutchinson|2008|p=269}}\n\n==Early life==\nThomas Cromwell was born around 1485, in [[Putney]], [[Surrey]], the son of Walter Cromwell, a blacksmith, [[fulling|fuller]] and cloth merchant, and owner of both a [[inn|hostelry]] and a [[brewery]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Walter Cromwell is considered by some to be of [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|p=36}} Thomas's mother, Katherine Maverell, was the aunt of Nicholas Glossop of [[Wirksworth]] in Derbyshire. She lived in Putney in the house of a local attorney, John Welbeck, at the time of her marriage to Walter Cromwell in 1474.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nCromwell had two sisters: Katherine, married [[Morgan ap William|Morgan Williams]], a Welsh lawyer; the younger, Elizabeth, married a farmer, William Wellyfed.{{sfn|Gerhold|2017|p=26: Which sister was the elder is unknown}}  Katherine and Morgan's son, [[Richard Williams (alias Cromwell)|Richard]], was employed in his uncle's service and by the autumn of 1529 had changed his name to Cromwell.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|p=38}}\n\nLittle is known about Cromwell's early life. It is believed that he was born at the top of Putney Hill, on the edge of [[Putney Heath]].  In 1878, his birthplace was still of note:\n<blockquote>The site of Cromwell's birthplace is still pointed out by tradition and is in some measure confirmed by the survey of Wimbledon Manor, quoted above, for it describes on that spot 'an ancient cottage called the smith's shop, lying west of the highway from Richmond to Wandsworth, being the sign of the Anchor'. The plot of ground here referred to is now covered by the Green Man public house.{{sfn|Walford|1878|pp=489\u2013503}}</blockquote>\n\nCromwell declared to [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Thomas Cranmer]] that he had been a \"ruffian\u2026 in his young days\".{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}  As a youth, he left his family in Putney, and crossed the Channel to the continent. Accounts of his activities in France, Italy and the [[Low Countries]] are sketchy and contradictory.

At some point he returned to Italy. The records of the English Hospital in Rome indicate that he stayed there in June 1514,{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} while documents in the [[Vatican Secret Archives|Vatican Archives]] suggest that he was an agent for the [[Archbishop of York]], [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Christopher Bainbridge]], and handled English ecclesiastical issues before the [[Roman Rota]].{{sfn|Kinney|2001|p=172}}\n\n==Marriage and issue==\nAt one point during these years, Cromwell returned to England, where around 1515 he married [[Elizabeth Wyckes]] (d. 1529).{{sfn|Fitzgerald and MacCulloch|2016}} She was the widow of Thomas Williams, a [[Yeomen of the Guard|Yeoman of the Guard]], and the daughter of a Putney shearman, Henry Wykes, who had served as a [[gentleman usher]] to [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\nThe couple had three children:{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=16, 23, 33}}\n* [[Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell]] (c. 1520\u201351), who was [[Elizabeth Seymour, Baroness Cromwell|Elizabeth Seymour]]'s second husband\n* Anne Cromwell (died c. 1529)\n* Grace Cromwell (died c. 1529)\n\nCromwell's wife died early in 1529{{sfn|Fitzgerald and MacCulloch|2016|p=591}} and his daughters, Anne and Grace, are believed to have died not long after their mother.

He was one of Wolsey's council by 1519, and his secretary by 1529.{{sfn|Bindoff|1982}} In the mid-1520s, Cromwell assisted in the dissolution of nearly thirty monasteries to raise funds for Wolsey to found [[Ipswich School|The King's School, Ipswich]] (1528), and [[Christ Church, Oxford|Cardinal College]], in Oxford (1529).{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} In 1526, Wolsey appointed Cromwell a member of his council; by 1529, Cromwell was one of Wolsey's most senior and trusted advisers. By the end of October of that year, however, Wolsey had fallen from power.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Cromwell had made enemies by aiding Wolsey to suppress the monasteries, but was determined not to fall with his master, as he told [[George Cavendish (writer)|George Cavendish]], then a Gentleman Usher and later Wolsey's biographer:<blockquote>I do entend (god wyllyng) this after none, whan my lord hathe dyned to ride to london and so to the Court, where I wyll other make or marre, or ere [before] I come agayn, I wyll put my self in the prese [press] to se what any man is Able to lay to my charge of ontrouthe or mysdemeanor.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}</blockquote>\n\n==Royal favourite==\nCromwell successfully overcame the shadow cast over his career by Wolsey's downfall.

At the centre of the campaign to secure the annulment was the emerging doctrine of royal supremacy over the church. By the autumn of 1531, Cromwell had taken control of the supervision of the king's legal and parliamentary affairs, working closely with [[Thomas Audley, 1st Baron Audley of Walden|Thomas Audley]], and had joined the inner circle of the Council. By the following spring, he had begun to exert influence over elections to the House of Commons.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nThe third session of what is now known as the [[English Reformation Parliament|Reformation Parliament]] had been scheduled for October 1531, but was postponed until 15 January 1532 because of government indecision as to the best way to proceed. Cromwell now favoured the assertion of royal supremacy, and manipulated the Commons by resurrecting anti-clerical grievances expressed earlier in the session of 1529. On 18 March 1532, the Commons delivered a supplication to the king, denouncing clerical abuses and the power of the ecclesiastical courts, and describing Henry as \"the only head, sovereign lord, protector and defender\" of the Church. The clergy resisted the Act of 1529 where they were prevented from appealing to Church-established courts, or [[Ecclesiastical court]] to settle disputes. Instead they were forced to go through the public courts as lay people.{{clarify|date=April 2016}} The clergy capitulated when faced with the threat of parliamentary reprisal. On 14 May 1532, Parliament was [[prorogued]]. Two days later, [[Sir Thomas More]] resigned as [[Lord Chancellor]], realising that the battle to save the marriage was lost. More's resignation from the Council represented a triumph for Cromwell and the pro-Reformation faction at court.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nThe king's gratitude to Cromwell was expressed in a grant of the lordship of Romney{{clarify|date=April 2016}} in Newport, Wales, and appointment to three relatively minor offices: [[Master of the Jewel Office|Master of the Jewels]] on 14 April 1532, Clerk of the [[Hanaper]] on 16 July, and [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] on 12 April 1533. None of these offices afforded much income, but the appointments were an indication of royal favour, and gave Cromwell a position in three major institutions of government: the royal household, the Chancery, and the Exchequer.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n[[File:Anneboleyn2.jpg|thumbnail|[[Anne Boleyn]]]]\n\nOn 26 January 1533, Audley was appointed Lord Chancellor, and <!--on the same day?-->Cromwell increased his control over the Commons through his management of by-elections. Henry and Anne married on 25 January 1533, after a secret marriage on 14 November 1532 that historians believe took place in Calais. On 23 May 1533, newly appointed Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer declared Henry and Catherine's marriage null and void; five days later, he declared Henry and Anne's marriage valid.\n\nThe parliamentary session began on 4 February, and Cromwell introduced a new bill restricting the right to make appeals to Rome. On 30 March, Cranmer was consecrated Archbishop of Canterbury, and [[Convocation of the English Clergy|Convocation]] immediately declared the king's marriage to Catherine unlawful. In the first week of April 1533, Parliament passed Cromwell's bill into law, as the [[Statute in Restraint of Appeals|Act in Restraint of Appeals]], ensuring that any verdict concerning the king's marriage could not be challenged in Rome. On 11 April, Archbishop Cranmer sent the King a pro forma challenge to the validity of his marriage to Catherine. A formal trial began on 10 May 1533 in Dunstable and on 23 May the Archbishop pronounced sentence, declaring the marriage illegal. Five days later he pronounced the King's marriage to Anne to be lawful, and on 1 June, she was crowned queen.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nIn December, the King authorised Cromwell to discredit the papacy and the Pope was attacked throughout the nation in sermons and pamphlets. In 1534 a new Parliament was summoned, again under Cromwell's supervision, to enact the legislation necessary to make a formal break of England's remaining ties with Rome. Archbishop Cranmer's sentence took statutory form as the Act of Succession, the Dispensations Act reiterated royal supremacy and the Act for the Submission of the Clergy incorporated into law the clergy's surrender in 1532. On 30 March 1534, Audley gave royal assent to the legislation in the presence of the King.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n==King's chief minister==\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2014}}\nIn April 1534, Henry confirmed Cromwell as his principal secretary and chief minister, a position which he had held for some time in all but name. Cromwell immediately took steps to enforce the legislation just passed by Parliament. Before the members of both houses returned home on 30 March, they were required to swear an oath accepting the Act of Succession, and all the King's subjects were now required to swear to the legitimacy of the marriage and, by implication, to accept the King's new powers and the break from Rome. On 13 April, the London clergy accepted the oath. On the same day, the commissioners offered it to Sir Thomas More and [[John Fisher]], Bishop of Rochester, both of whom refused it. More was taken into custody on the same day and was moved to the Tower of London on 17 April. Fisher joined him there four days later.\n\nOn 18 April, an order was issued that all citizens of London were to swear. Similar orders were issued throughout the country. When Parliament reconvened in November, Cromwell brought in the most significant revision of the treason laws since 1352, making it treasonous to speak rebellious words against the Royal Family, to deny their titles, or to call the King a heretic, tyrant, infidel, or usurper. The Act of Supremacy also clarified the King's position as head of the church and the Act for Payment of First Fruits and Tenths substantially increased clerical taxes. Cromwell also strengthened his own control over the Church. On 21 January 1535, the King appointed him Royal Vicegerent and Vicar-General, and commissioned him to organise visitations of all the country's churches, monasteries, and clergy. In this capacity, Cromwell conducted a census in 1535 to enable the government to tax church property more effectively.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n===Fall of Anne Boleyn===\n[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - Jane Seymour, Queen of England - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Jane Seymour]] by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]\nThe final session of the Reformation Parliament began on 4 February 1536. By 18 March, an Act for the Suppression of the Lesser Monasteries, those with a gross income of less than \u00a3200 per annum, had passed both houses. This caused a clash with Anne Boleyn, formerly one of Cromwell's strongest allies, who wanted the proceeds of the dissolution used for educational and charitable purposes, not paid into the King's coffers.<ref>Eric Ives \"the Life and Death of Anne Boleyn\"</ref>\n\nAnne instructed her chaplains to preach against the Vicegerent, and in a blistering sermon on Passion Sunday, 2 April 1536, her [[almoner]], [[John Skip]], denounced Cromwell and his fellow Privy Councillors before the entire court. Skip's diatribe was intended to persuade courtiers and Privy Councillors to change the advice they had been giving the King and to reject the temptation of personal gain. Skip was called before the Council and accused of malice, slander, presumption, lack of charity, sedition, treason, disobedience to the gospel, attacking 'the great posts, pillars and columns sustaining and holding up the commonwealth' and inviting anarchy.{{sfn|Ives|2005|pp=307\u2013310}}{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=176\u2013179}}\n\nAnne, who had many enemies at court, had never been popular with the people and had so far failed to produce a male heir. The King was growing impatient, having become enamoured of the young [[Jane Seymour]] and encouraged by Anne's enemies, particularly Nicholas Carew and the Seymours. In circumstances that have divided historians, Anne was accused of adultery with [[Mark Smeaton]], a musician of the royal household, [[Henry Norris (courtier)|Henry Norris]], the King's groom of the stool and one of his closest friends, Sir [[Francis Weston]], [[William Brereton (groom)|William Brereton]] and her brother, [[George Boleyn, Viscount Rochford|Viscount Rochford]].{{sfn|Lipscomb|April 2013|pp=18\u201324}}{{sfn|Schofield|2011|pp=192\u2013205}} The Imperial Ambassador, [[Eustace Chapuys]], wrote to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] that: <blockquote>he himself [Cromwell] has been authorised and commissioned by the king to prosecute and bring to an end the mistress's trial, to do which he had taken considerable trouble...

The men were executed on 17 May 1536 and, on the same day, Cranmer declared Henry's marriage to Anne invalid, a ruling that illegitimised their daughter, [[Elizabeth I of England|Princess Elizabeth]]. Two days later, Anne herself was executed. On 30 May, the King married Jane Seymour. On 8 June, a new Parliament passed the second Act of Succession, securing the rights of Queen Jane's heirs to the throne.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n===Baron Cromwell and Lord Privy Seal===\n[[File:Coat of arms of Sir Thomas Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell, KG.png|thumb|220px|Cromwell's arms as they were before his son's marriage to the queen's sister.{{sfn|MacCulloch|2018|pp=38\u20139, note 81}}]]\nCromwell's position was now stronger than ever.

This resulted in the dispersal and destruction of many books deemed \"popish\" and \"superstitious\". This has been described as \"easily the greatest single disaster in English literary history\". [[Oxford University]] was left without a library collection until Sir Thomas Bodley's donation in 1602.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SochIc9cRGQC&pg=PT58|title=Mediaeval Education and the Reformation|author=John Lawson|date=15 April 2013|accessdate=17 November 2015|isbn=9781135031091}}</ref>\n\nIn July 1536, the first attempt was made to clarify religious doctrine after the break with Rome. Bishop [[Edward Foxe]] tabled proposals in Convocation, with strong backing from Cromwell and Cranmer, which the King later endorsed as the [[Ten Articles]] and which were printed in August 1536. Cromwell circulated injunctions for their enforcement that went beyond the Articles themselves, provoking opposition in September and October in [[Lincolnshire]] and then throughout the six northern counties. These widespread popular and clerical uprisings found support among the gentry and even the nobility; they were collectively known as the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The pilgrimage of grace and the politics of the 1530s|last=Hoyle, R.

One of the leaders of the rebellion was [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy of Darcy]], who gave Cromwell the prophetic warning (just prior to his execution) \"others that have been in such favour with kings as you now enjoy have come to the same fate you bring me to\".{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n[[File:Thomas Cromwell medal, 1538 side 2.png|thumbnail|right|Portrait medal made for Thomas Cromwell in 1538.

In February 1537, Cromwell convened a [[vicegerent]]ial [[synod]] of bishops and doctors. The synod was co-ordinated by Cranmer and Foxe, and they prepared a draft document by July: ''[[The Institution of a Christian Man]]'', more commonly known as the [[Bishops' Book]]. By October, it was in circulation, although the King had not yet given it his full assent. However, Cromwell's success in Church politics was offset by the fact that his political influence had been weakened by the emergence of a [[Privy Council]], a body of nobles and office-holders that first came together to suppress the Pilgrimage of Grace. The King confirmed his support of Cromwell by appointing him to the [[Order of the Garter]] on 5 August 1537, but Cromwell was nonetheless forced to accept the existence of an executive body dominated by his conservative opponents.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nIn January 1538, Cromwell pursued an extensive campaign against what was termed \"idolatry\" by the followers of the old religion. Statues, [[rood screen]]s, and images were attacked, culminating in September with the dismantling of the shrine of St. [[Thomas Becket]] at Canterbury. Early in September, Cromwell also completed a new set of vicegerential injunctions declaring open war on \"pilgrimages, feigned relics or images, or any such superstitions\" and commanding that \"one book of the whole Bible in English\" be set up in every church. Moreover, following the \"voluntary\" surrender of the remaining smaller monasteries during the previous year, the larger monasteries were now also \"invited\" to surrender throughout 1538, a process legitimised in the 1539 session of Parliament and completed in the following year.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n====Resistance to further religious reform====\nThe King was becoming increasingly unhappy about the extent of religious changes, and the conservative faction was gaining strength at court. Cromwell took the initiative against his enemies. He imprisoned the [[Henry Courtenay, 1st Marquess of Exeter|Marquess of Exeter]], [[Sir Edward Neville]], and Sir [[Nicholas Carew (courtier)|Nicholas Carew]] on charges of treason in November 1538, using evidence acquired from [[Sir Geoffrey Pole]] under interrogation in the Tower. All were executed in the following months.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}\n\nOn 17 December 1538, the Inquisitor-General of France forbade the printing of [[Miles Coverdale]]'s [[Great Bible]]. Cromwell persuaded the King of France to release the unfinished books so that printing could continue in England. The first edition was finally available in April 1539. The publication of the Great Bible was one of Cromwell's principal achievements, the first authoritative version in English.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\nThe King, however, continued to resist further Reformation measures. A Parliamentary committee was established to examine doctrine, and the [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk|Duke of Norfolk]] presented six questions on 16 May 1539 for the House to consider, which were duly passed as the Act of [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]] shortly before the session ended on 28 June. The Six Articles reaffirmed a traditional view of the Mass, the Sacraments, and the priesthood.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n===Anne of Cleves===\n[[File:Anne of Cleves, by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|''[[Anne of Cleves]]'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], c. 1539]]\n\nQueen Jane had died in 1537, less than two weeks after the birth of her only child, the future [[Edward VI]]. In early October 1539, the King finally accepted Cromwell's suggestion that he should marry [[Anne of Cleves]], the sister of [[William, Duke of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Duke Wilhelm]] of [[United Duchies of J\u00fclich-Cleves-Berg|Cleves]], partly on the basis of a portrait which [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] had painted of her. On 27 December, Anne of Cleves arrived at Dover. On New Year's Day 1540, the King met her at [[Rochester, Kent|Rochester]] and was immediately repelled by her physically: \"I like her not!\" The wedding ceremony took place on 6 January at Greenwich, but the marriage was not consummated. Henry said that he found it impossible to enjoy conjugal relations with a woman whom he found so unattractive.{{sfn|Weir|1991|pp=377\u201378, 386\u201388, 395, 405, 410\u201311}}\n\n===Earl of Essex===\nOn 18 April 1540, Henry granted Cromwell the [[Earl of Essex|earldom of Essex]] and the senior Court office of [[Lord Great Chamberlain]].{{sfn|Leithead|2008}} Despite these signs of royal favour, Cromwell's tenure as the King's chief minister was almost over. The King's anger at being forced to marry Anne of Cleves was the opportunity Cromwell's conservative opponents, most notably the Duke of Norfolk, needed to topple him.{{sfn|Weir|1991|pp=412, 418}}\n\n=== Downfall and execution===\nDuring 1536 Cromwell had proven himself an adept political survivor. However, the gradual slide towards Protestantism at home and the King's ill-starred marriage to [[Anne of Cleves]], which Cromwell engineered in January 1540, proved costly. Some historians believe that [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] was partly responsible for Cromwell's downfall because he had provided a very flattering portrait of Anne which may have deceived the king. (The 65 \u00d7 48&nbsp;cm painting is now displayed at the [[Louvre]] in Paris.)

In early 1540, Cromwell's conservative, aristocratic enemies, headed by the Duke of Norfolk and assisted by [[Stephen Gardiner|Bishop Gardiner]] (colloquially known as 'Wily Winchester'), saw in [[Catherine Howard]] an opportunity to displace their foe.\n\nCromwell was arrested at a Council meeting on 10 June 1540 and accused of various charges. He was imprisoned in the [[Tower of London|Tower]]. His enemies took every opportunity to humiliate him: they even tore off his [[Order of the Garter]], remarking that \"A traitor must not wear it.\" His initial reaction was defiance: \"This then is my reward for faithful service!\" he cried out,  and angrily defied his fellow Councillors to call him a traitor.  A [[Bill of Attainder]] containing a long list of indictments, including supporting [[Anabaptists]], corrupt practices, leniency in matters of justice, acting for personal gain, protecting Protestants accused of heresy and thus failing to enforce the [[Act of Six Articles]], and plotting to marry [[Mary I of England|Lady Mary Tudor]], was introduced into the [[House of Lords]] a week later and passed on 29 June 1540.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yoevCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA141&dq=thomas+cromwell+++10+June+1540+bill+of+attainder#v=onepage&q=thomas+cromwell+++10+June+1540+bill+of+attainder&f=false|title=Thomas Cromwell: Tudor Minister|first=B.

In 1536, he established the [[Court of Augmentations]] to handle the massive windfall to the royal coffers from the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Two other important financial institutions, the [[Court of Wards and Liveries|Court of Wards]] and the [[Court of First Fruits and Tenths]], owed their existence to him, although they were not set up until after his death. He strengthened royal authority in the north of England, through reform of the [[Council of the North]], extended royal power and introduced Protestantism in Ireland, and was the architect of the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542]], which promoted stability and gained acceptance for the royal supremacy in Wales. He also introduced important social and economic reforms in England in the 1530s, including action against [[enclosure]]s, the promotion of English cloth exports and the [[poor relief]] legislation of 1536.{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n==Personal religious beliefs==\nAlthough Cromwell always maintained a primarily political outlook on general affairs, there is consensus among scholars that at least while he held power he was a Protestant, with a Lutheran mindset. For him, the [[Henrician Reformation]] was certainly more than a jurisdictional revolution masquerading in religious garb. For instance, in the mid-1530s, he promoted Protestant ideas to forge an alliance with German Lutheran states, but his support for the Protestant cause is too general to be accurately explained in narrow political terms.<ref>William Underwood, \"Thomas Cromwell and William Marshall's Protestant books\".

Elton wrote that Cromwell had been responsible for translating royal supremacy into parliamentary terms, creating powerful new organs of government to take charge of Church lands, and largely removing the medieval features of central government.\n\nSubsequent historians have agreed with Elton as to Cromwell's importance, though not with his claims of \"revolution\".{{sfn|Bernard|1998|pp=587\u2013607 Bernard argues Elton exaggerated Cromwell's role}}{{sfn|Coby|2009|p=197}}{{sfn|Kenyon|1983|p=210}} Leithead (2004) wrote, \"Against significant opposition he secured acceptance of the king's new powers, created a more united and more easily governable kingdom, and provided the crown, at least temporarily, with a very significant landed endowment.\"{{sfn|Leithead|2008}}\n\n==Descendants==\nThomas Cromwell's son [[Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell]], married [[Elizabeth Seymour, Baroness Cromwell|Elizabeth Seymour]], the sister of [[Queen Jane Seymour]] and widow of Sir [[Anthony Ughtred]].

In the fiction, he is imbued with family affections, genuine respect for Cardinal Wolsey, zeal for the Reformation, and support for a limited degree of social reform, while the villainous character is [[Thomas More]].\n\n===Theatre===\n* Cromwell is a supporting character in [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]]'s 1613 play ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]''.\n* He is the subject of ''[[Thomas Lord Cromwell]]'', a 1602 play. It is attributed on the title pages of the 1603 and 1613 editions to 'W.S.', and is classed as part of Shakespearean apocrypha.\n*In the original stage production of [[Maxwell Anderson]]'s ''[[Anne of the Thousand Days]]'', which deals with the marriage of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, Cromwell was portrayed by Wendell K. Phillips. He is depicted here as totally ruthless and unscrupulous.\n* Cromwell is the main antagonist in [[Robert Bolt]]'s play ''[[A Man for All Seasons]]'', in which he is portrayed as ruthlessly ambitious and jealous of Sir Thomas More's influence with the King. Cromwell was played by [[Andrew Keir]] when the play opened in London, and by [[Leo McKern]] on Broadway.\n* Cromwell was portrayed by John Dougall in [[Shakespeare's Globe]]'s production of ''[[Anne Boleyn (play)|Anne Boleyn]]'' by [[Howard Brenton]] in 2010, and Julius D'Silva in 2011.\n*Cromwell was portrayed in ''Henry VIII The Musical'', a youth production that premi\u00e8red in London in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Henry VIII The Musical|url=http://www.henryviiithemusical.com|publisher=Henryviiithemusical.com|accessdate=9 February 2014}}</ref>\n*In 2014 the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] staged an adaptation by [[Mike Poulton]] of Dame [[Hilary Mantel]]'s first two Cromwell novels.

The series 'Tudor Crimes' covers the years from 1529 to 1551 in great depth and provides us with a dichotomy of a man, humane to the poor, yet ruthless to the nobility. ''Winter King'' is the first book in this series. \n* Cromwell is the subject of [[Hilary Mantel]]'s novels ''[[Wolf Hall]]'' (2009) and ''[[Bring Up the Bodies]]'' (2012), which explore his humanity and to some extent rebut the unflattering portrait in ''A Man for All Seasons''. ''Wolf Hall'' won the 2009 and ''Bring Up the Bodies'' the 2012 [[Man Booker Prize]]. The last book by Mantel in the trilogy is ''[[The Mirror and the Light]]'', which was published in March 2020. \n* Cromwell is one of  the major characters of ''Frailty of Human Affairs'' (2017), book one of the Queenmaker Series, and book two ''Shaking the Throne'' (2018)\" about Cromwell and his secretary Nicola Fresocobaldi, by Caroline Angus-Baker.\n* Cromwell is a leading character in the first two Matthew Shardlake historical crime fiction novels by [[C. J. Sansom]], ''[[Dissolution (Sansom novel)|Dissolution]]'' and ''[[Dark Fire (Sansom novel)|Dark Fire]]''.\n* He is given minor roles in two of [[Philippa Gregory]]'s novels, ''[[The Other Boleyn Girl]]'' (2001) and ''[[The Boleyn Inheritance]]''.\n* He is one of the major characters in [[H. F. M. Prescott]]'s novel ''The Man on a Donkey'', which depicts a power struggle between Cromwell and [[Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy|Lord Darcy]], who represents the old nobility.\n*He is a major character in ''[[The Fifth Queen]]'' by [[Ford Madox Ford]].\n\n===Film===\n* [[Franklin Dyall]] portrayed Cromwell in ''[[The Private Life of Henry VIII]]'' (1933).\n* In the film [[A Man for All Seasons (1966 film)|''A Man for All Seasons'']], Cromwell was played by [[Leo McKern]], who also played the role on stage on Broadway.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060665/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm| title = A Man for All Seasons, full cast| accessdate = 28 October 2014| publisher = Internet Movie Database}}</ref>\n* Cromwell has also been portrayed by [[John Colicos]] in the film ''[[Anne of the Thousand Days]]'' (1969), by [[Kenneth Williams]] in the classic British comedy ''[[Carry On Henry]]'' (1971), by [[Donald Pleasence]] in ''[[Henry VIII and His Six Wives (film)|Henry VIII and His Six Wives]]'' (1972), and by Iain Mitchell in ''[[The Other Boleyn Girl (2008 film)|The Other Boleyn Girl]]'' (2008).\n\n===Television===\n* Cromwell was played by [[Wolfe Morris]] in the BBC miniseries ''[[The Six Wives of Henry VIII (BBC TV series)|The Six Wives of Henry VIII]]'' (1970), and by [[Danny Webb (actor)|Danny Webb]] in the Granada Television production ''[[Henry VIII (TV serial)|Henry VIII]]'' (2003). In the television version of ''The Other Boleyn Girl'' (2003), he was played by veteran actor [[Ron Cook]].\n* In the television series ''[[The Tudors]]'' (2007), Cromwell was played by English actor [[James Frain]]; he is portrayed as Machiavellian, cunning and devoted to the English Reformation at any cost, though he is not entirely unsympathetic. Frain played the character for three seasons; Cromwell's execution brought the third season to its conclusion.\n* In ''The Twisted Tale of Bloody Mary'' (2008), an independent film from TV Choice Productions, Cromwell is played by Burtie Welland.\n* Thomas Cromwell, played by [[Mark Rylance]], is the central figure in the [[BBC]]'s six-part series ''[[Wolf Hall (TV series)|Wolf Hall]]'', based on [[Hilary Mantel]]'s novels ''[[Wolf Hall]]'' and ''[[Bring Up the Bodies]]'', which was first broadcast on 21 January 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21712688|title=Mark Rylance set for Hilary Mantel TV drama|work=BBC News|date=8 March 2012|accessdate=16 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Beazley\n  |first=F.

{"title_page": "Sports in Aruba", "text_new": "{{copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n[[Aruba]] is a 19 mile long island in the [[Caribe|Caribbean]] that promotes many '''sports''', which also fuels the economy.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nTheir culture has developed from an increase in tourism due to the natural beauty of the island.{{Promotion inline|date=April 2020}} In turn, this has led to an increased following for their recreational activities from sports such as [[basketball]] and [[soccer]] to their more native pastimes such as [[kite surfing]] and [[spearfishing]]. Aruba now has a nationally ranked soccer team, and produces many successful athletes that move to the [[United States]] to follow their passions.{{Importance inline}}\n[[File:Plaza Daniel Leo, Oranjestad, Aruba - February 2020.jpg|thumb|This is Plaza Daniel Leo located in [[Oranjestad]] which is where the stadiums are located. It's named after a past politician.]]\n\n== Recreational sports ==\nDue to an increase in tourism revenue, Aruba has been able to invest more into sports programs and events. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.topendsports.com/world/countries/aruba.htm|title=Sport in Aruba|website=www.topendsports.com|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> Unlike in previous years, Aruba now has a competitive recreational basketball team. The sport fishing and kite surfing industries have also grown significantly in recent years.{{Promotion inline|date=April 2020}}<ref name=\":0\" /> Citizens of Aruba are also very competitive in baseball and soccer.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Basketball ==\nAruba's recreational [[basketball]] program consists of 16 teams and more than 200 players from the ages of 12 to 18.  Basketball clubs have largely contributed to the development of the sport on the island.  One of the main objectives of the program is to eventually get one of their athletes an academic scholarship to play in the United States.  Aruba is also making efforts to certify one of their referees for international [[FIBA]] events.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.fiba.basketball/|title=FIBA.basketball|website=FIBA.basketball|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n== Baseball ==\n[[Baseball]] is one of the most popular sports on the island and has helped produce many star athletes that go to the States to continue their success. Baseball as a recreational sport originated in the 1930's and many people have grown a passion for it through the years. It has produced many star athletes like [[Gene Kingsale|Eugene Humphrey Kingsale]], he has played for a number of professional baseball teams in his 7 year span from 1996-2003. Aruba little league originated in 1958, and has continued to grow in popularity since then.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://arubalittleleague.org/|title=Aruba Little League|website=Aruba Little League|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref>\n\n== Kite boarding ==\nThe conditions in Aruba are perfectly suited for [[Kite boarding]] year-round.

This included Caroline Sullivan, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', who found some of the content too similar to other bands but praised the minor intricacies in tracks like \"Chloe\", \"Spun\" and \"Naked Kids\": \"What it lacks in originality it makes up for in sweet vibes, which may not keep Grouplove going for ever, but is enough for the moment.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Weighted mean|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Standard score|average]] score of 66, based on 14 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> On the positive side, [[AllMusic]] journalist Matt Colla praised the band's musicianship for being technically sound and expressive in its genre-mashing, concluding that \"Ultimately, Grouplove's ''Never Trust a Happy Song'' is a cohesive if ramshackle crowd-pleaser, full of melodic double-lead vocals, handclaps, ringing electric guitars, and staccato synth parts that tips a hat to '80s dance-rock while still retaining the band's obvious love of experimental '60s folk-rock.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> David Menconi of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' praised the album's production for carrying exuberant energy to match its happy-go-lucky content, saying that \"For all its youthful pathos, ''Never Trust a Happy Song'' evokes pop colors bright enough to glow at tempos just short of manic -- even \"Slow\" doesn't stay that way for long.\"<ref name=\"Spin\"/>\n\n''Never Trust a Happy Song'' had some detractors.

The album was given a [[Gold (music sales)|Gold]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting sales of over 500,000 copies.\n\n==Singles==\n* \"Tongue Tied\" debuted on number 78 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] on December 8, 2011. It later peaked at number 42. It was also featured as the song in Apple's [[iPod Touch]] commercial \"Share the fun.\"\n* \"Tongue Tied\" achieved the number 16 position on Australian national radio station Triple J's Hottest 100 for 2011 with \"Naked Kids\" reaching number 95 and \"Itchin' on a Photograph\" coming in at number 43\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| MC         = 66/100<ref name=\"Metacritic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/never-trust-a-happy-song/grouplove|title=Reviews for Never Trust a Happy Song by Grouplove|website=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| rev1       = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score  = {{Rating|3.5|5}}<ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/never-trust-a-happy-song-r2259559|title=Never Trust a Happy Song - Grouplove|last=Collar|first=Matt|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}</ref>\n| rev2       = [[Consequence of Sound]]\n| rev2Score  = (C-)<ref name=\"CofS\">{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/09/album-review-grouplove-never-trust-a-happy-song/|title=Grouplove \u2013 Never Trust a Happy Song|last=Young|first=Alex|publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]]|date=September 6, 2011|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| rev3       = [[Drowned in Sound]]\n| rev3Score  = (5/10)<ref name=\"DiS\">{{cite magazine|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/16464/reviews/4143491|title=Album Review: Grouplove - Never Trust a Happy Song|last=Cooke|first=Robert|magazine=[[Drowned in Sound]]|date=September 5, 2011|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}</ref>\n| rev4       = ''[[The Guardian]]''\n| rev4Score  = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Guardian\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/01/grouplove-never-trust-happy-review|title=Grouplove: Never Trust a Happy Song \u2013 review|last=Sullivan|first=Caroline|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|date=September 1, 2011|accessdate=February 9, 2012|location=London}}</ref>\n| rev5       = [[MusicOMH]]\n| rev5Score  = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"OMH\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/grouplove-never-trust-a-happy-song|title=Grouplove \u2013 Never Trust A Happy Song|last=Raymond|first=Max|publisher=[[MusicOMH]]|date=September 5, 2011|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| rev6       = ''[[NME]]''\n| rev6Score  = (6/10)<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/grouplove/12299|title=Album Review: Grouplove - 'Never Trust A Happy Song'|last=Hewitt|first=Ben|work=[[NME]]|publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=September 6, 2011|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}</ref>\n| rev7       = [[PopMatters]]\n| rev7Score  = {{Rating|5|10}}<ref name=\"PM\">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/148739-grouplove-never-trust-a-happy-song/|title=Grouplove: Never Trust a Happy Song|last=Esdall|first=Matt|website=[[PopMatters]]|date=October 5, 2011|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| rev8       = [[Slant Magazine]]\n| rev8Score  = {{Rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Slant\">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/grouplove-never-trust-a-happy-song|title=Grouplove Never Trust a Happy Song|last=Jones|first=Huw|publisher=[[Slant Magazine]]|date=September 7, 2011|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n| rev9       = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev9Score  = (7/10)<ref name=\"Spin\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/grouplove-never-trust-happy-song-canvasbackatlantic|title=Grouplove, 'Never Trust a Happy Song' (Canvasback/Atlantic)|last=Menconi|first=David|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=[[SpinMedia]]|date=September 13, 2011|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>\n| rev10      = [[Tiny Mix Tapes]]\n| rev10Score = {{Rating|1|5}}<ref name=\"Tapes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/grouplove-never-trust-happy-song|title=Grouplove - Never Trust a Happy Song|last=Parker|first=James|publisher=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|date=September 29, 2011|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n''Never Trust a Happy Song'' received generally positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], but found the band too similar to bands like [[MGMT]], [[Passion Pit]], [[fun.]], and [[The Killers]], in terms of lyrics and instrumentation. This included Caroline Sullivan, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', who found some of the content too similar to other bands but praised the minor intricacies in tracks like \"Chloe\", \"Spun\" and \"Naked Kids\": \"What it lacks in originality it makes up for in sweet vibes, which may not keep Grouplove going for ever, but is enough for the moment.\"<ref name=\"Guardian\"/> At [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[Weighted mean|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an [[Standard score|average]] score of 66, based on 14 reviews.<ref name=\"Metacritic\"/> On the positive side, [[AllMusic]] journalist Matt Colla praised the band's musicianship for being technically sound and expressive in its genre-mashing, concluding that \"Ultimately, Grouplove's ''Never Trust a Happy Song'' is a cohesive if ramshackle crowd-pleaser, full of melodic double-lead vocals, handclaps, ringing electric guitars, and staccato synth parts that tips a hat to '80s dance-rock while still retaining the band's obvious love of experimental '60s folk-rock.\"<ref name=\"AM\"/> David Menconi of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' praised the album's production for carrying exuberant energy to match its happy-go-lucky content, saying that \"For all its youthful pathos, ''Never Trust a Happy Song'' evokes pop colors bright enough to glow at tempos just short of manic -- even \"Slow\" doesn't stay that way for long.\"<ref name=\"Spin\"/>\n\n''Never Trust a Happy Song'' had some detractors. Huw Jones of [[Slant Magazine]] felt the album paled in comparison to the band's [[Grouplove (EP)|self-titled EP]] with adequate lyrics and shoddy song placement derailing its true strength, saying that \"''Never Trust a Happy Song''{{'}}s finer moments arrive when Grouplove is crafting sun-kissed anthems that deserve to be blared across beaches or, at least, from the speakers of any open-top car en route to the shore.\"<ref name=\"Slant\"/> Writing for [[musicOMH]], Max Raymond noted that the tracks throughout the album flip-flop between overly schmaltzy sugar and transparent mediocrity with decent songwriting and face value quality: \"On their own merits some of these tracks are classy pop songs, but there needs to be more depth and scope to Grouplove\u2019s sound if they are to look forward.\"<ref name=\"OMH\"/> [[Drowned in Sound]]'s Robert Cooke felt there was moments on the album that showed the band's potential, but it was ruined by the jumbling of different genres and questionable instrumentation choices throughout the songs.<ref name=\"DiS\"/> The harshest review came from James Parker, who wrote for [[Tiny Mix Tapes]]; he heavily criticized the band's upbeat, sunny demeanor for being an \"indie equivalent\" to mainstream pop hits and said that it only catered to hipster parties, concluding that \"Considering what this record\u2019s meant to be doing, then, you could reasonably argue that it does it pretty well. Except I won\u2019t.

The screenplay by [[Wendell Mayes]] was based on the novel of the same name written by [[Michigan Supreme Court]] Justice [[John D. Voelker]] under the [[pen name]] Robert Traver. Voelker based the novel on a 1952 murder case in which he was the defense attorney.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/killing-michigan-bar-owner-1952-inspired-film-anatomy-murder-article-1.423705 |title = Justice Story: The Murder Behind the Movie |work = [[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location = New York |access-date = October 6, 2017 |language = en }}</ref>\n\nThe film stars [[James Stewart]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Ben Gazzara]], [[Eve Arden]], [[George C. Scott]], [[Arthur O'Connell]], [[Kathryn Crosby|Kathryn Grant]], Brooks West (Arden's husband), [[Orson Bean]], and [[Murray Hamilton]]. The judge was played by [[Joseph N. Welch]], a real-life lawyer famous for dressing down [[Joseph McCarthy]] during the [[Army-McCarthy hearings]]. It has a musical score by [[Duke Ellington]], who also appears in the film. It has been described by a law professor as \"probably the finest pure [[Trial film|trial movie]] ever made\".<ref name=\"usfca.edu\"/>\n\nIn 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite news |last = King |first = Susan |url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-national-film-registry-20121217,0,1057524.story |title = National Film Registry Selects 25 Films for Preservation |work = [[Los Angeles Times]] |date = December 19, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Anatomymurder trailer 2.jpg|left|thumb|\"Now listen! This is a cross examination in a murder case, it's not a high school debate!\" Brooks West (left) and [[James Stewart]] (right) face one another, as [[George C. Scott]] (center) looks on]]\nIn the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]], small-town lawyer Paul Biegler (Stewart), a former [[district attorney]] who lost his re-election bid, spends most of his time fishing, playing the piano, and hanging out with his [[alcoholic]] friend and colleague Parnell McCarthy (O'Connell) and sardonic secretary Maida Rutledge (Arden).\n\nOne day, Biegler is contacted by Laura Manion (Remick), to defend her husband US Army Lieutenant Frederick \"Manny\" Manion (Gazzara), who has been arrested for the first-degree murder of innkeeper Bernard \"Barney\" Quill. Manion does not deny the murder, but claims that Quill raped his wife. Even with such a motivation, getting Manion cleared of murder would be difficult, but Manion claims to have no memory of the event, suggesting that he may be eligible for a defense of [[irresistible impulse]]\u2014a version of a [[temporary insanity]] defense. Biegler's folksy speech and laid-back demeanor hide a sharp legal mind and a propensity for courtroom theatrics that has the judge busy keeping things under control. However, the case for the defense does not go well, especially since the local district attorney (Brooks West) is assisted by high-powered prosecutor Claude Dancer (Scott) from the Attorney General's office.\n\nFurthermore, the prosecution tries at every instance to block any mention of Manion's motive for killing Quill. Biegler eventually manages to get the rape of Laura Manion into the record and Judge Weaver ([[Joseph N. Welch]]) agrees to allow the matter to be part of the deliberations. During [[cross-examination]], Dancer insinuates that Laura openly flirted with other men, including the man she claimed raped her. Psychiatrists give conflicting testimony to Manion's state of mind at the time that he killed Quill. Dancer says that Manion may have suspected Laura of cheating on him because he asked his wife, a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], to swear on a [[rosary]] that Quill raped her. This raises doubt as to whether the act was non-consensual.\n\nQuill's estate is to be inherited by Mary Pilant ([[Kathryn Crosby|Kathryn Grant]]), whom Dancer accuses of being Quill's mistress. McCarthy learns that she is in fact Quill's daughter, a fact she is anxious to keep secret since she was born out of wedlock. Biegler, who is losing the case, tries to persuade Pilant that Al Paquette ([[Murray Hamilton]]), the bartender who witnessed the murder, may know if Quill admitted to him of raping Laura but Paquette is covering this up, either because he loves Pilant or out of loyalty to Quill. Through Pilant, Biegler is unable to get Paquette to testify on behalf of Manion.\n\nDuring the trial, Laura claims that Quill tore off her panties while raping her; the panties were not found where she alleges the rape took place. Pilant, unaware of any details of the case, testifies that she found the panties in the inn's laundry room. Biegler suggests Quill may have attempted to avoid suspicion by dropping the panties down the [[laundry chute]], located next to his room. Dancer tries to establish that Pilant's answers are founded on her jealousy. When Dancer asserts forcibly that Quill was Pilant's lover and that Pilant lied to cover this fact, Pilant shocks everyone by stating that Quill was her father. Manion is found \"not guilty by reason of insanity\". After the trial, Biegler decides to open a new practice, with a newly sober McCarthy as his partner.\n\n[[File:Anatomymurder trailer 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[James Stewart]] in the film's trailer]]\nThe next day, Biegler and McCarthy travel to the Manions' [[trailer park]] home to get Manion's signature on a [[promissory note]] which they hope will suffice as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] for a desperately needed loan. It turns out the Manions have vacated the trailer park, the trailer park superintendent commenting that Laura Manion had been crying. Manion left a note for Biegler, indicating that his flight was \"an irresistible impulse\", the same justification Biegler used during the trial. Biegler states that Mary Pilant has retained him to execute Quill's estate; McCarthy says that working for her will be \"[[poetic justice]]\".\n\n==Inspiration==\nOn July 31, 1952, Lt. Coleman A.

Voelker based the novel on a 1952 murder case in which he was the defense attorney.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/killing-michigan-bar-owner-1952-inspired-film-anatomy-murder-article-1.423705 |title = Justice Story: The Murder Behind the Movie |work = [[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |location = New York |access-date = October 6, 2017 |language = en }}</ref>\n\nThe film stars [[James Stewart]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Ben Gazzara]], [[Eve Arden]], [[George C. Scott]], [[Arthur O'Connell]], [[Kathryn Crosby|Kathryn Grant]], Brooks West (Arden's husband), [[Orson Bean]], and [[Murray Hamilton]]. The judge was played by [[Joseph N.

It has a musical score by [[Duke Ellington]], who also appears in the film, and has been described by a law professor as \"probably the finest pure [[Trial film|trial movie]] ever made\".<ref name=\"usfca.edu\"/>\n\nIn 2012, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite news |last = King |first = Susan |url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/moviesnow/la-et-mn-national-film-registry-20121217,0,1057524.story |title = National Film Registry Selects 25 Films for Preservation |work = [[Los Angeles Times]] |date = December 19, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[File:Anatomymurder trailer 2.jpg|left|thumb|\"Now listen! This is a cross examination in a murder case, it's not a high school debate!\" Brooks West (left) and [[James Stewart]] (right) face one another, as [[George C. Scott]] (center) looks on]]\nIn the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]], small-town lawyer Paul Biegler (Stewart), a former [[district attorney]] who lost his re-election bid, spends most of his time fishing, playing the piano, and hanging out with his [[alcoholic]] friend and colleague Parnell McCarthy (O'Connell) and sardonic secretary Maida Rutledge (Arden).\n\nOne day, Biegler is contacted by Laura Manion (Remick), to defend her husband US Army Lieutenant Frederick \"Manny\" Manion (Gazzara), who has been arrested for the first-degree murder of innkeeper Bernard \"Barney\" Quill. Manion does not deny the murder, but claims that Quill raped his wife. Even with such a motivation, getting Manion cleared of murder would be difficult, but Manion claims to have no memory of the event, suggesting that he may be eligible for a defense of [[irresistible impulse]]\u2014a version of a [[temporary insanity]] defense. Biegler's folksy speech and laid-back demeanor hide a sharp legal mind and a propensity for courtroom theatrics that has the judge busy keeping things under control. However, the case for the defense does not go well, especially since the local district attorney (Brooks West) is assisted by high-powered prosecutor Claude Dancer (Scott) from the Attorney General's office.\n\nFurthermore, the prosecution tries at every instance to block any mention of Manion's motive for killing Quill. Biegler eventually manages to get the rape of Laura Manion into the record and Judge Weaver ([[Joseph N. Welch]]) agrees to allow the matter to be part of the deliberations. During [[cross-examination]], Dancer insinuates that Laura openly flirted with other men, including the man she claimed raped her. Psychiatrists give conflicting testimony to Manion's state of mind at the time that he killed Quill. Dancer says that Manion may have suspected Laura of cheating on him because he asked his wife, a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], to swear on a [[rosary]] that Quill raped her. This raises doubt as to whether the act was non-consensual.\n\nQuill's estate is to be inherited by Mary Pilant ([[Kathryn Crosby|Kathryn Grant]]), whom Dancer accuses of being Quill's mistress. McCarthy learns that she is in fact Quill's daughter, a fact she is anxious to keep secret since she was born out of wedlock. Biegler, who is losing the case, tries to persuade Pilant that Al Paquette ([[Murray Hamilton]]), the bartender who witnessed the murder, may know if Quill admitted to him of raping Laura but Paquette is covering this up, either because he loves Pilant or out of loyalty to Quill. Through Pilant, Biegler is unable to get Paquette to testify on behalf of Manion.\n\nDuring the trial, Laura claims that Quill tore off her panties while raping her; the panties were not found where she alleges the rape took place. Pilant, unaware of any details of the case, testifies that she found the panties in the inn's laundry room. Biegler suggests Quill may have attempted to avoid suspicion by dropping the panties down the [[laundry chute]], located next to his room. Dancer tries to establish that Pilant's answers are founded on her jealousy. When Dancer asserts forcibly that Quill was Pilant's lover and that Pilant lied to cover this fact, Pilant shocks everyone by stating that Quill was her father. Manion is found \"not guilty by reason of insanity\". After the trial, Biegler decides to open a new practice, with a newly sober McCarthy as his partner.\n\n[[File:Anatomymurder trailer 1.jpg|right|thumb|[[James Stewart]] in the film's trailer]]\nThe next day, Biegler and McCarthy travel to the Manions' [[trailer park]] home to get Manion's signature on a [[promissory note]] which they hope will suffice as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] for a desperately needed loan. It turns out the Manions have vacated the trailer park, the trailer park superintendent commenting that Laura Manion had been crying. Manion left a note for Biegler, indicating that his flight was \"an irresistible impulse\", the same justification Biegler used during the trial. Biegler states that Mary Pilant has retained him to execute Quill's estate; McCarthy says that working for her will be \"[[poetic justice]]\".\n\n==Inspiration==\nOn July 31, 1952, Lt. Coleman A.
