He won the 2007 [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award in the [[NASCAR]] [[Craftsman Truck Series]].\n\n==Career==\nAllen ran two [[ARCA Racing Series]] races in 2006, with a best finish of sixth at the second of the two at [[Nashville Superspeedway]], and is a regular competitor at [[Fairgrounds Speedway]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].<ref name=\"WA Career\">{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/driver/Willie_Allen|title=Willie Allen Career Statistics|publisher=Racing-Reference|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref>  Allen won the 2006 NASCAR points title for Music City Motorplex late model stock car division and the 2015 Big Machine Records Pro Late Model Challenge Series presented by Hunter Sand & Gravel championship at Fairgrounds Speedway Nashville.     \n\n===Camping World Truck Series===\nAllen made his NASCAR [[Craftsman Truck Series]] debut in 2005 in the [[Kroger 200 (Martinsville)|Kroger 200]] at [[Martinsville Speedway]] driving for [[Morgan-Dollar Motorsports]], starting 21st and finishing sixth. He made one more start in 2005 for [[SS-Green Light Racing]] before signing with [[ThorSport Racing]] to run the final race of 2006 and ultimately replace [[Kerry Earnhardt]] in the No. 13 truck for the 2007 season. Allen ran his first full season in NASCAR in 2007 and at the [[Mountain Dew 250]] at [[Talladega Superspeedway]], matched his career-best finish with a sixth-place run. However, it was his lone top 10 on the season, and he was replaced by [[Shelby Howard]] for the 2008 season. \n\nFor 2008, Allen returned to Morgan-Dollar Motorsports to drive the No. 46 [[Chevrolet Silverado]] to a 19th-place finish in the [[MemphisTravel.com 200]] at [[Memphis Motorsports Park]]. He then drove two of the next three races in the No. 81 for the newly renamed [[Randy Moss Motorsports]] (RMM), after [[Randy Moss]] had bought a 50 percent share in Morgan-Dollar Motorsports. His first race was on July 19 at [[Kentucky Speedway]] with sponsorship from [[Rascal Flatts]], where he finished 15th. Two races later, Allen made his third start of the year at [[Nashville Superspeedway]] with sponsorship from Rascal Flatts and [[GoDaddy]], but crashed late in the race and finished 27th. Afterwards, Allen parted ways with RMM. After not racing in 2009, Allen returned to the series in 2010 for [[Team Gill Racing]] to run the No. 46 in the [[Bully Hill Vineyards 200|Nashville 200]], starting 36th and finishing 29th. Allen has not raced in the series since.<ref name=\"WA Career\"/>\n\n===Nationwide Series===\nAllen made his Nationwide debut in 2006 for [[FitzBradshaw Racing]], racing at [[Memphis Motorsports Park]] and [[Phoenix International Raceway]], with a best finish of 28th. In 2008, Allen ran two races with [[Sadler-Hamilton Racing]] ([[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] and [[Nashville Superspeedway|Nashville]]), with a best finish of 29th at Daytona. The next year, Allen ran five races for [[Whitney Motorsports]], but failed to finish all five. He also failed to qualify for a sixth race. He then signed to drive the No. 05 [[31-W Insulation]]/[[CertainTeed]]/[[Cash America]] car for [[Day Motorsports]] in 2010, running 18 races with a best finish of 11th. Allen also failed to qualify for four additional races. Allen ran two more races for Day Motorsports in 2011 before departing the team and the series.<ref name=\"WA Career\"/>\n\nAfter several years out of NASCAR, Allen returned to compete in the Nationwide Series in 2014, driving for the debuting [[Martins Motorsports]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20140119/SPORTS09/301190117/Nashville-team-plans-race-NASCAR-s-Nationwide-Series|title=Nashville team plans to race in NASCAR's Nationwide Series|date=January 19, 2014|publisher=[[The Tennessean]]|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

He won the 2007 [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] award in the [[NASCAR]] [[Craftsman Truck Series]].\n\n==Career==\nAllen ran two [[ARCA Racing Series]] races in 2006, with a best finish of sixth at the second of the two at [[Nashville Superspeedway]], and is a regular competitor at [[Fairgrounds Speedway]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].<ref name=\"WA Career\">{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/driver/Willie_Allen|title=Willie Allen Career Statistics|publisher=Racing-Reference|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref>  Allen won the 2006 NASCAR points title for Music City Motorplex late model stock car division and the 2015 Big Machine Records Pro Late Model Challenge Series presented by Hunter Sand & Gravel championship at Fairgrounds Speedway Nashville.     \n\n===Camping World Truck Series===\nAllen made his NASCAR [[Craftsman Truck Series]] debut in 2005 in the [[Kroger 200 (Martinsville)|Kroger 200]] at [[Martinsville Speedway]] driving for [[Morgan-Dollar Motorsports]], starting 21st and finishing sixth. He made one more start in 2005 for [[SS-Green Light Racing]] before signing with [[ThorSport Racing]] to run the final race of 2006 and ultimately replace [[Kerry Earnhardt]] in the No. 13 truck for the 2007 season. Allen ran his first full season in NASCAR in 2007 and at the [[Mountain Dew 250]] at [[Talladega Superspeedway]], matched his career-best finish with a sixth-place run. However, it was his lone top 10 on the season, and he was replaced by [[Shelby Howard]] for the 2008 season. \n\nFor 2008, Allen returned to Morgan-Dollar Motorsports to drive the No. 46 [[Chevrolet Silverado]] to a 19th-place finish in the [[MemphisTravel.com 200]] at [[Memphis Motorsports Park]]. He then drove two of the next three races in the No. 81 for the newly renamed [[Randy Moss Motorsports]] (RMM), after [[Randy Moss]] had bought a 50 percent share in Morgan-Dollar Motorsports. His first race was on July 19 at [[Kentucky Speedway]] with sponsorship from [[Rascal Flatts]], where he finished 15th. Two races later, Allen made his third start of the year at [[Nashville Superspeedway]] with sponsorship from Rascal Flatts and [[GoDaddy]], but crashed late in the race and finished 27th. Afterwards, Allen parted ways with RMM. After not racing in 2009, Allen returned to the series in 2010 for [[Team Gill Racing]] to run the No. 46 in the [[Bully Hill Vineyards 200|Nashville 200]], starting 36th and finishing 29th. Allen has not raced in the series since.<ref name=\"WA Career\"/>\n\n===Nationwide Series===\nAllen made his Nationwide debut in 2006 for [[FitzBradshaw Racing]], racing at [[Memphis Motorsports Park]] and [[Phoenix International Raceway]], with a best finish of 28th. In 2008, Allen ran two races with [[Sadler-Hamilton Racing]] ([[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] and [[Nashville Superspeedway|Nashville]]), with a best finish of 29th at Daytona. The next year, Allen ran five races for [[Whitney Motorsports]], but failed to finish all five. He also failed to qualify for a sixth race. He then signed to drive the No. 05 [[31-W Insulation]]/[[CertainTeed]]/[[Cash America]] car for [[Day Motorsports]] in 2010, running 18 races with a best finish of 11th. Allen also failed to qualify for four additional races. Allen ran two more races for Day Motorsports in 2011 before departing the team and the series.<ref name=\"WA Career\"/>\n\nAfter several years out of NASCAR, Allen returned to compete in the Nationwide Series in 2014, driving for the debuting [[Martins Motorsports]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20140119/SPORTS09/301190117/Nashville-team-plans-race-NASCAR-s-Nationwide-Series|title=Nashville team plans to race in NASCAR's Nationwide Series|date=January 19, 2014|publisher=[[The Tennessean]]|accessdate=February 14, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.

P. Jagannath]]. The film features an ensemble cast including [[Cheran (director)|Cheran]], [[Pasupathy]], [[Nithin Sathya]], [[Vimala Raman]], [[Remya Nambeeshan]], [[Gajala]], [[Navya Nair]], and [[Karthika Adaikalam|Karthika]]. The music was composed by [[Vidyasagar (music director)|Vidyasagar]] with cinematography by [[Rajesh Yadav]] and editing by [[Kola Bhaskar]]. The film released on 19 September 2008.\n\nIn 2012, the film was remade in Kannada as ''Gowri Puthra'' with Akshay.<ref>https://www.nowrunning.com/movie/11115/kannada/gowri-puthra/3815/review.htm</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe movie starts with Venugopal ([[Cheran (director)|Cheran]]) meeting Ranjitha ([[Vimala Raman]]), whose parents want them to get married. During their conversation, Venu informs Ranjitha that he stammers if he gets stressed and is also undergoing treatment for psychological problems while he was at school. Ranjitha gets scared hearing this and turns down the proposal.\n\nVenu is a kindhearted person who manages his own wedding card business. He remains clear that the girl that he marries should know about his problem, and he does not want to marry someone by hiding his problem. Venu's mother arranges to meet another girl named Vidhya ([[Remya Nambeesan]]). Vidhya agrees for the wedding despite knowing Venu's problems. However, on the day before the wedding, Vidhya's lover Ramesh ([[Vidharth]]), with whom she has broken up, comes and apologizes. Vidhya changes her mind and elopes with Ramesh, which shocks both Venu and her father Manikkavel ([[Manivannan]]).\n\nHowever, Venu cancels the wedding saying that he is not interested in marrying Vidhya, thereby hiding the truth that Vidhya has eloped with someone. Manikkavel feels proud seeing Venu and also feels bad that his daughter has missed such a kindhearted person in her life. Also, Manickavel apologizes to Venu for his daughter's behaviour and promises to find a suitable girl for Venu soon.\n\nAfter so many girls rejecting Venu due to his stammering speech problem, Gayathri ([[Karthika Adaikalam|Karthika]]) agrees to marry him. Venu also likes Gayathri, but he meets Gunasekhar ([[Nithin Sathya]]), an auto driver who claims to be Gayathri's lover. Guna describes his one side love towards Gayathri to Venu and Manickavel while travelling in his auto without knowing that Venu has come to see Gayathri. Venu meets Gayathri and tells her that Guna loves her sincerely and advises her to accept his love. Gayathri also understands this and agrees to marry Guna.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a positive love story told between a visually challenged RJ named Nedumaran ([[Pasupathy]]) and Thamizhisai ([[Gajala]]). Nedumaran anchors a radio program about the importance of facing life with a positive attitude, and Thamizhisai is a very big fan of Nedumaran's radio program. However, Thamizhisai gets shocked upon knowing that Nedumaran is visually challenged. Despite this, she feels proud of him seeing his positive attitude towards life. They become good friends, and Thamizhisai proposes to Nedumaran, which he does not accept as he fears that her family members will not allow her to marry him. He later realizes her true love, and they both get married. Venu is a friend of Nedumaran and he gets inspired seeing his positive tone in life.\n\nVenu and Manikkavel travel to Nagercoil for a business visit. Venu is shocked by Vidhya's poverty. Venu leaves without informing Manikkavel to meet Vidhya and gets to know that she is pregnant and Ramesh is in jail for involving in a clash with their neighbour. Vidhya works in a small school and struggles to lead a proper life without money. Venu feels bad seeing her condition and gives some money. He also takes her to a nearby private hospital for a check-up. To his surprise, Ranjitha works as a receptionist in that hospital. Venu introduces Vidhya as his friend and requests Ranjitha to assist her during her further check-ups, and he pays the hospital expenses.\n\nAs Vidhya's delivery date approaches, Venu decides to stay in Nagercoil for a few more days until she gives birth to the child, thereby assisting with the hospital formalities. Slowly, Venu befriends Ranjitha, and the two meet frequently. Vidhya gives birth to a baby, and Venu informs this to Manikkavel, who gets furious hearing this. Manikkavel gets emotional and scolds Venu for helping someone who ditched him on the day of wedding. However, Venu convinces Manikkavel and takes him to see his daughter. Ranjitha comes to know about Venu's great character and slowly, love blossoms in her.\n\nNow, Venu and Manikkavel are set to meet a girl named Senthamarai ([[Navya Nair]]) who is a sub-inspector in Nagercoil. Venu informs this to Ranjitha, which shocks her. Ranjitha does not express her love towards Venu. Venu decides to secretly meet Senthamarai while she is on duty without informing her. Suddenly, violence erupts in the location, and Senthamarai starts hitting the protesters in order to control the crowd. She even hits Venu also without knowing that he has come to visit her.

P. Jagannath]]. The film features an ensemble cast including [[Cheran (director)|Cheran]], [[Pasupathy]], [[Nithin Sathya]], [[Vimala Raman]], [[Remya Nambeeshan]], [[Gajala]], [[Navya Nair]], and [[Karthika Adaikalam|Karthika]]. The music was composed by [[Vidyasagar (music director)|Vidyasagar]] with cinematography by [[Rajesh Yadav]] and editing by [[Kola Bhaskar]]. The film released on 19 September 2008.\n\nIn 2012, the film was remade in Kannada as ''Gowri Puthra'' with Akshay.<ref>https://www.nowrunning.com/movie/11115/kannada/gowri-puthra/3815/review.htm</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n\nThe movie starts with Venugopal ([[Cheran (director)|Cheran]]) meeting Ranjitha ([[Vimala Raman]]), whose parents want them to get married. During their conversation, Venu informs Ranjitha that he stammers if he gets stressed and is also undergoing treatment for psychological problems while he was at school. Ranjitha gets scared hearing this and turns down the proposal.\n\nVenu is a kindhearted person who manages his own wedding card business. He remains clear that the girl that he marries should know about his problem, and he does not want to marry someone by hiding his problem. Venu's mother arranges to meet another girl named Vidhya ([[Remya Nambeesan]]). Vidhya agrees for the wedding despite knowing Venu's problems. However, on the day before the wedding, Vidhya's lover Ramesh ([[Vidharth]]), with whom she has broken up, comes and apologizes. Vidhya changes her mind and elopes with Ramesh, which shocks both Venu and her father Manikkavel ([[Manivannan]]).\n\nHowever, Venu cancels the wedding saying that he is not interested in marrying Vidhya, thereby hiding the truth that Vidhya has eloped with someone. Manikkavel feels proud seeing Venu and also feels bad that his daughter has missed such a kindhearted person in her life. Also, Manickavel apologizes to Venu for his daughter's behaviour and promises to find a suitable girl for Venu soon.\n\nAfter so many girls rejecting Venu due to his stammering speech problem, Gayathri ([[Karthika Adaikalam|Karthika]]) agrees to marry him. Venu also likes Gayathri, but he meets Gunasekhar ([[Nithin Sathya]]), an auto driver who claims to be Gayathri's lover. Guna describes his one side love towards Gayathri to Venu and Manickavel while travelling in his auto without knowing that Venu has come to see Gayathri. Venu meets Gayathri and tells her that Guna loves her sincerely and advises her to accept his love. Gayathri also understands this and agrees to marry Guna.\n\nOn the other hand, there is a positive love story told between a visually challenged RJ named Nedumaran ([[Pasupathy]]) and Thamizhisai ([[Gajala]]). Nedumaran anchors a radio program about the importance of facing life with a positive attitude, and Thamizhisai is a very big fan of Nedumaran's radio program. However, Thamizhisai gets shocked upon knowing that Nedumaran is visually challenged. Despite this, she feels proud of him seeing his positive attitude towards life. They become good friends, and Thamizhisai proposes to Nedumaran, which he does not accept as he fears that her family members will not allow her to marry him. He later realizes her true love, and they both get married. Venu is a friend of Nedumaran and he gets inspired seeing his positive tone in life.\n\nVenu and Manikkavel travel to Nagercoil for a business visit. Venu gets shocked to see Vidhya there leading a below poverty life. Venu leaves without informing Manikkavel to meet Vidhya and gets to know that she is pregnant and Ramesh is in jail for involving in a clash with their neighbour. Vidhya works in a small school and struggles to lead a proper life without money. Venu feels bad seeing her condition and gives some money. He also takes her to a nearby private hospital for a check-up. To his surprise, Ranjitha works as a receptionist in that hospital. Venu introduces Vidhya as his friend and requests Ranjitha to assist her during her further check-ups, and he pays the hospital expenses.\n\nAs Vidhya's delivery date approaches, Venu decides to stay in Nagercoil for a few more days until she gives birth to the child, thereby assisting with the hospital formalities. Slowly, Venu befriends Ranjitha, and the two meet frequently. Vidhya gives birth to a baby, and Venu informs this to Manikkavel, who gets furious hearing this. Manikkavel gets emotional and scolds Venu for helping someone who ditched him on the day of wedding. However, Venu convinces Manikkavel and takes him to see his daughter. Ranjitha comes to know about Venu's great character and slowly, love blossoms in her.\n\nNow, Venu and Manikkavel are set to meet a girl named Senthamarai ([[Navya Nair]]) who is a sub-inspector in Nagercoil. Venu informs this to Ranjitha, which shocks her. Ranjitha does not express her love towards Venu. Venu decides to secretly meet Senthamarai while she is on duty without informing her. Suddenly, violence erupts in the location, and Senthamarai starts hitting the protesters in order to control the crowd. She even hits Venu also without knowing that he has come to visit her. Venu feels guilty now and decides to cancel the meeting. While going back, he sees Ranjitha's house on the way. He decides to refresh there and then leave. However, Ranjitha proposes her love to Venu and apologizes for rejecting him at the very beginning not understanding his true character, which is more precious. Venu understands Ranjitha and decides to marry her.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Cheran (director)|Cheran]] as Venugopal\n* [[Pasupathy]] as Nedumaran\n* [[Nithin Sathya]] as Gunasekhar\n* [[Vimala Raman]] as Ranjitha\n* [[Remya Nambeeshan]] as Vidhya Manikkavel\n* [[Gajala]] as Thamizhisai Nedumaran\n* [[Karthika Adaikalam|Karthika]] as Gayathri\n* [[Navya Nair]] as Senthamarai\n* [[Manivannan]] as Manikkavel\n* [[Karunas]] as Murali\n* [[Vidharth (actor)|Vidharth]] as Ramesh (Vidhya's husband)\n* [[Appukutty]]\n\n==Production==\n\n===Casting===\nThe film was announced in 2007, and the photo session was held at the time of launch.<ref>[http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/34568.html \"'Raman Thediya Seethai' says, Cheran!\"].</ref> [[Gajala]] was selected as one of the leads.<ref>[http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/36624.html \"Gajala in 'Raman Thediya Seethai'\"].</ref> Kerala-based [[Remya Nambeesan]] was selected, and she joined in second schedule.<ref>[http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/malayalam/article/37063.html \"Remya joins 'Raman Thediya Seethai'\"].</ref> [[Vimala Raman]] of ''[[Poi (film)|Poi]]'',<ref>[http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/tamil/article/35302.html \"Vimala Raman to pair with Cheran\"].</ref> [[Karthika Adaikalam|Karthika]] of ''[[Thoothukudi]]'', and [[Navya Nair]] were selected since the story needed five heroines.

He played an important role in the establishment of the colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], the first permanent [[English colonial empire|English settlement]] in America in the early 17th century. He was a leader of the [[Virginia Colony]] between September 1608 and August 1609, and he led an exploration along the rivers of Virginia and the [[Chesapeake Bay]], during which he became the first English explorer to map the Chesapeake Bay area. Later, he explored and mapped the coast of New England. He was knighted for his services to [[Sigismund B\u00e1thory]], Prince of [[Transylvania]], and his friend [[M\u00f3zes Sz\u00e9kely]].\n\nJamestown was established in 1607, and Smith trained the first settlers to farm and work, thus saving the colony from early devastation. He publicly stated, \"[[He who does not work, neither shall he eat|He that will not work, shall not eat]]\", alluding to [[s:Bible (American Standard)/2 Thessalonians#3:10|2 Thessalonians 3:10]].<ref name=SnellCh4>{{harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4}}</ref> Harsh weather, lack of food and water, the surrounding swampy wilderness, and Indian attacks almost destroyed the colony. With Smith's leadership, however, Jamestown survived and eventually flourished. Smith was forced to return to England after being injured by an accidental explosion of gunpowder in a canoe.\n\nSmith's books and maps were important in encouraging and supporting English colonization of the [[New World]]. He named the region of New England and noted: \"Here every man may be master and owner of his owne labour and land.&nbsp;...

The search for a suitable site ended on 14 May 1607 when Captain [[Edward Maria Wingfield]], president of the council, chose the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] site as the location for the colony. After the four-month ocean trip, their food stores were sufficient only for each to have a cup or two of grain-meal per day, and someone died almost every day due to swampy conditions and widespread disease.

The village was on the north shore of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] about 15 miles north of Jamestown and 25 miles downstream from where the river forms from the [[Pamunkey River]] and the [[Mattaponi River]] at [[West Point, Virginia]]. Smith feared for his life, but he was eventually released without harm and later attributed this in part to the chief's daughter [[Pocahontas]] who threw herself across his body:<ref>Smith, ''Generall Historie''</ref> \"at the minute of my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her own brains to save mine; and not only that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was safely conducted to Jamestown\".<ref name=\"Letter to Queen Anne\">{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Caleb|title=John Smith's Letter to Queen Anne regarding Pocahontas|url=http://members.aol.com/mayflo1620/pocahontas.html|website=Mayflower Web Pages|accessdate=13 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616092056/http://members.aol.com/mayflo1620/pocahontas.html|archivedate=June 16, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 1860, Boston businessman and historian Charles Deane was the first scholar to question specific details of Smith's writings. Smith's version of events is the only source and skepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such doubt is that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith's earliest surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] to treat Pocahontas with dignity.<ref name=\"Letter to Queen Anne\"/> The time gap in publishing his story raises the possibility that Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas' image. However, professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith's earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, there was no reason for him to write down the story until this point.<ref>Lemay, J. A. Leo. ''Did Pocahontas Save Captain John Smith?'' Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 1992, p. 25. Lemay's other arguments in favour of Smith are summarized in Birchfield, [http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html 'Did Pocahontas'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626175132/http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html |date=26 June 2012 }}.</ref>\n\n[[Henry Brooks Adams]] attempted to debunk Smith's claims of heroism. He was craving dark cacao from the middle east. He said that Smith's recounting of the story of Pocahontas had been progressively embellished, made up of \"falsehoods of an effrontery seldom equaled in modern times\". There is consensus among historians that Smith tended to exaggerate, but his account is consistent with the basic facts of his life.<ref>[[Jill Lepore|Lepore, Jill]], \"The New Yorker\", 2 April 2007, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Some have suggested that Smith believed that he had been rescued, when he had in fact been involved in a ritual intended to symbolize his death and rebirth as a member of the tribe.<ref>Gleach, ''Powhatan's World'', pp. 118\u201321.; Kupperman, ''Indians and English'', pp. 114, 174.</ref><ref>{{Cite book | author=Horwitz, Tony | title=A Voyage Long and Strange: Rediscovering the New World | publisher=Henry Holt and Co. | isbn=978-0-8050-7603-5 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/voyagelongstrang00horw/page/336 336] | url=https://archive.org/details/voyagelongstrang00horw/page/336 | date=29 April 2008 }}</ref> David A.

[[Karen Kupperman]] suggests that he \"presented those remembered events from decades earlier\" when telling the story of Pocahontas.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/jamestownproject00kupp <!-- quote=The Jamestown Project. --> Karen Ordahl Kupperman, ''The Jamestown Project''], Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2007, 51\u201360, 125\u20136</ref> Whatever really happened, the encounter initiated a friendly relationship between the Indians and the colonists at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]. As the colonists expanded farther, some of the tribes felt that their lands were threatened, and conflicts arose again.\n\nIn 1608, Pocahontas is said to have saved Smith a second time. Chief Powhatan invited Smith and some other colonists to Werowocomoco on friendly terms, but Pocahontas came to the hut where they were staying and warned them that Powhatan was planning to kill them. They stayed on their guard and the attack never came.<ref>Symonds, ''Proceedings'', pp. 251\u20132; Smith, ''Generall Historie'', pp. 198\u20139, 259.</ref> Also in 1608, Polish craftsmen were brought to the colony to help it develop.

These explorations are commemorated in the [[Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail]], established in 2006. In his absence, Smith left his friend [[Matthew Scrivener]] as governor in his place, a young gentleman adventurer from Sibton [[Suffolk]] who was related by marriage to the Wingfield family, but he was not capable of leading the people.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Smith was elected president of the local council in September 1608.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\n===Influx of settlers===\nSome of the settlers eventually wanted Smith to abandon Jamestown, but he refused. Some deserted to the Indian villages, but Powhatan's people also followed Smith's law of \"he who works not, eats not\". This lasted \"till they were near starved indeed\", in Smith's words, and they returned home.<ref name=SnellCh4 />\n\nIn the spring of 1609, Jamestown was beginning to prosper, with many dwellings built, acres of land cleared, and much other work done. Then in April, they experienced an infestation of rats, along with dampness which destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent a large group of settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Indians and ordered everyone to work or be banished from the fort.<ref name=snch4p85 />\n\nThe weeks-long emergency was relieved by the arrival of an unexpected ship captained by [[Samuel Argall]]. He had items of food and wine which Smith bought on credit. Argall also brought news that the Virginia Company of London was being reorganized and was [[Jamestown supply missions|sending more supplies and settlers]] to Jamestown, along with [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Lord De la Warr]] to become the new governor.<ref name=snch4p85 />\n[[File:John Smith taking the King of Pamavnkee prisoner - etching.jpg|thumb|right|John Smith taking the King of Pamunkey prisoner (1624 history)]]\n\nIn a May 1609 voyage to Virginia, Virginia Company treasurer [[Thomas Smythe|Sir Thomas Smith]] arranged for about 500 colonists to come along, including women and children. A fleet of nine ships set sail. One sank in a storm soon after leaving the harbour, and the ''[[Sea Venture]]'' wrecked on the Bermuda Islands with flotilla admiral Sir [[George Somers]] aboard. They finally made their way to Jamestown in May 1610 after building the ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'' to take most of the passengers and crew of the ''Sea Venture'' off Bermuda, with the new governor [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]] on board.<ref>{{harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4|p=91}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1609, Smith was quite surprised to see more than 300 new settlers arrive, which did not go well for him. London was sending new settlers with no real planning or logistical support.<ref name=SnellCh4 /> Then in May 1610, Somers and Gates finally arrived with 150 people from the ''Sea Venture''. Gates soon found that there was not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown. As their boats were leaving the Jamestown area, they met a ship carrying the new governor Lord De la Warr, who ordered them back to Jamestown.<ref name=\"SnellCh4\" /> Somers returned to Bermuda with the ''Patience'' to gather more food for Jamestown but died there. The ''Patience'' then sailed for England instead of Virginia, captained by his nephew.\n\nSmith was severely injured by a gunpowder explosion in his canoe, and he sailed to England for treatment in mid-October 1609. He never returned to Virginia.<ref name=SnellCh4 /> Colonists continued to die from various illnesses and disease, with an estimated 150 surviving that winter out of 500 residents. The Virginia Company, however, continued to finance and transport settlers to sustain Jamestown.

The expedition's second vessel under the command of Thomas Hunt stayed behind and captured a number of Indians as slaves,{{sfn|Smith|1907|p=II:4}} including [[Squanto]] of the [[Patuxet]]. Smith was convinced that Hunt's actions were directed at him; by inflaming the local population, Smith said, he could \"prevent that intent I had to make a plantation there\", keeping the country in \"obscuritie\" so that Hunt and a few merchants could monopolize it.{{sfn|Smith|1907|p=II:4}} According to Smith, Hunt had taken his maps and notes of the area to defeat's Smith's settlement plans.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1616|p=47}} reprinted in {{harvnb|Arber|1910|p=I:219}}.</ref> He could not believe that Hunt was driven by greed since there was \"little private gaine\" to be gotten; Hunt \"sold those silly Salvages for Rials of eight.\"{{sfn|Smith|1907|pp=II:4\u20135}}\n\nSmith published a map in 1616 based on the expedition which was the first to bear the label \"New England\", though the Indian place names were replaced by the names of English cities at the request of [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]].<ref name=\"globe_1614\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/06/14/the-lie-that-charted-new-england-future/qLDvF4PTlo1EetZbtUh4rI/story.html|title=The lie that charted New England's future|work=BostonGlobe.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}</ref> The settlers of [[Plymouth Colony]] adopted the name that Smith gave to that area,<ref name=\"globe_1614\" /> and other place names on the map survive today, such as the [[Charles River]] (marked as The River Charles) and [[Cape Ann]] (Cape Anna).\n\n[[File:Descr.of.New England-Title page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of ''[[A Description of New England]]'' (1616)]]\nSmith made two attempts in 1614 and 1615 to return to the same coast. On the first trip, a storm dismasted his ship. In the second attempt, he was captured by French pirates off the coast of the [[Azore Islands|Azores]]. He escaped after weeks of captivity and made his way back to England, where he published an account of his two voyages as ''[[A Description of New England]]''. He remained in England for the rest of his life.\n\nSmith compared his experiences in Virginia with his observations of New England and offered a theory of why some English colonial projects had failed. He noted that the French had been able to monopolize trade in a very short time, even in areas nominally under English control. The people inhabiting the coasts from Maine to Cape Cod had \"large corne fields, and great troupes of well proportioned people\", but the French had obtained everything that they had to offer in trade within six weeks.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1616|p=26}} reprinted in {{harvnb|Arber|1910|p=I:205}}.</ref> This was due to the fact that the French had created a great trading network which they could exploit, and the English had not cultivated these relations.

The original monument was built in 1864 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Smith's visit to what he named Smith's Isles. It was a series of square granite slabs atop one another, with a small granite pillar at the top. (See the postcard to the right.) The pillar featured three carved faces, representing the severed heads of three Turks that Smith lopped off in combat during his stint as a soldier in Transylvania.<ref>J.

Most of the skepticism is a result of the differences between his narratives. His earliest text is ''A True Relation of Virginia'', which was submitted for publication in 1608, the year after his experiences in Jamestown. The second was ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'', published in 1624. Publishing letters, journals, and pamphlets from the colonists was regulated by the companies that sponsored the voyage, in that they must go \"directly to the company\" because no one was to \"write any letter of anything that may discourage others\". Smith violated this regulation by first publishing ''A True Relation'' as an unknown author.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=40}} Leo Lemay theorizes that the editor of ''The Generall Historie'' might have cut out \"references to the Indians' hostility, to bickering among the leaders of Virginia Company, and to the early supposed mutiny\" of Smith on the voyage to Virginia.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=41}}\n\n[[File:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' by Capt. John Smith, 1624]] \n[[File:John Smith 1624 map of Bermuda with Forts 01.jpg|thumb|Smith's 1624 map of the Somers Isles (Bermuda) showing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]] and related fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Islands Fortifications]]]]\n\nThe Pocahontas episode is subject to the most scrutiny by critics, for it does not appear in ''A True Relation'' but does in ''The Generall Historie''. According to Lemay, important evidence of Smith's credibility is the fact that \"no one in Smith's day ever expressed doubt\" concerning the story's veracity, and many people who would have known the truth \"were in London in 1616 when Smith publicised the story in a letter to the queen\", including Pocahontas herself.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=51}}\n\nSmith focuses heavily on Indians in all of his works concerning the New World. His relationship with the Powhatan tribe was an important factor in preserving the Jamestown colony from sharing the fate of the [[Roanoke colony]].\n\n<blockquote>Realizing that the very existence of the colony depended on peace, he never thought of trying to exterminate the natives. Only after his departure were there bitter wars and massacres, the natural results of a more hostile policy. In his writings, Smith reveals the attitudes behind his actions.<ref>Randel, William. \"Captain John Smith's Attitudes toward the Indians\". The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography (1939): 218\u2013229. p. 219</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Promoter of American colonization===\n{{one source|section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Capt John Smith's map of Virginia 1624.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Smith's map of Virginia from ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'', 1624]]\nOne of Smith's main incentives in writing about his New World experiences and observances was to promote English colonization. Lemay claims that many promotional writers sugar-coated their depictions of America in order to heighten its appeal, but he argues that Smith was not one to exaggerate the facts. He argues that Smith was very straightforward with his readers about both the dangers and the possibilities of colonization. Instead of proclaiming that there was an abundance of gold in the New World, as many writers did, Smith illustrated that there was abundant monetary opportunity in the form of industry.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=80}} Lemay argues that no motive except wealth would attract potential colonists away from \"their ease and humours at home\".<ref>Smith, John. \"A Description of New England\". ''The Heath Anthology of American Literature''. Ed. Paul Lauter. 6th Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009 [1616]. p. 282</ref> \"Therefore, he presented in his writings actual industries that could yield significant capital within the New World: fishing, farming, shipbuilding, and fur trading\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=91}}\n\nSmith insists, however, that only hard workers would be able to reap the benefits of wealth which the New World afforded. He did not understate the dangers and toil associated with colonization. He declared that only those with a strong work ethic would be able to \"live and succeed in America\" in the face of such dangers.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=81}}\n\n===Additional works===\n''A Map of Virginia'' is focused centrally on the observations that Smith made about the Native Americans, particularly regarding their religion and government. This specific focus would have been Smith's way of adapting to the New World by assimilating the best parts of their culture and incorporating them into the colony. ''A Map of Virginia'' was not just a pamphlet discussing the observations that Smith made, but also a map which Smith had drawn himself, to help make the Americas seem more domestic. As Lemay remarks, \"maps tamed the unknown, reduced it to civilisation and harnessed it for Western consciousness,\" promoting Smith's central theme of encouraging the settlement of America.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=42}} Many \"naysayers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century\" have made the argument that Smith's maps were not reliable because he \"lacked a formal education in cartography\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=43}} That allegation, however, was proved false by the fact that Smith was a \"master in his chosen fields of experience\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=43}}\n\n''[https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105044/http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/world_civ/worldcivreader/world_civ_reader_2/john_smith.html The Proceedings of the English Colony In Virginia]'' was a compilation of other writings; it narrates the colony's history from December 1609 to the summer of 1610, and Smith left the colony in October 1609 due to a gunpowder accident. The writing style of ''The Proceedings'' is thought to be better constructed than ''A Map of Virginia''.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=48}}\n\n==Publications==\nJohn Smith published eight volumes during his life.

He played an important role in the establishment of the colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], the first permanent [[English colonial empire|English settlement]] in America in the early 17th century. He was a leader of the [[Virginia Colony]] between September 1608 and August 1609, and he led an exploration along the rivers of Virginia and the [[Chesapeake Bay]], during which he became the first English explorer to map the Chesapeake Bay area. Later, he explored and mapped the coast of New England. He was knighted for his services to [[Sigismund B\u00e1thory]], Prince of [[Transylvania]], and his friend [[M\u00f3zes Sz\u00e9kely]].\n\nJamestown was established in 1607, and Smith trained the first settlers to farm and work, thus saving the colony from early devastation. He publicly stated, \"[[He who does not work, neither shall he eat|He that will not work, shall not eat]]\", alluding to [[s:Bible (American Standard)/2 Thessalonians#3:10|2 Thessalonians 3:10]].<ref name=SnellCh4>{{harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4}}</ref> Harsh weather, lack of food and water, the surrounding swampy wilderness, and Indian attacks almost destroyed the colony. With Smith's leadership, however, Jamestown survived and eventually flourished. Smith was forced to return to England after being injured by an accidental explosion of gunpowder in a canoe.\n\nSmith's books and maps were important in encouraging and supporting English colonization of the [[New World]]. He named the region of New England and noted: \"Here every man may be master and owner of his owne labour and land.&nbsp;... If he have nothing but his hands, he may&nbsp;... by industries quickly grow rich.\"<ref>David Cressy (1987). \"Coming Over: Migration and Communication Between England and New England in the Seventeenth Century\". p. 99.

The search for a suitable site ended on 14 May 1607 when Captain [[Edward Maria Wingfield]], president of the council, chose the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] site as the location for the colony. After the four-month ocean trip, their food stores were sufficient only for each to have a cup or two of grain-meal per day, and someone died almost every day due to swampy conditions and widespread disease.

The village was on the north shore of the [[York River (Virginia)|York River]] about 15 miles north of Jamestown and 25 miles downstream from where the river forms from the [[Pamunkey River]] and the [[Mattaponi River]] at [[West Point, Virginia]]. Smith feared for his life, but he was eventually released without harm and later attributed this in part to the chief's daughter [[Pocahontas]] who threw herself across his body:<ref>Smith, ''Generall Historie''</ref> \"at the minute of my execution, she hazarded the beating out of her own brains to save mine; and not only that, but so prevailed with her father, that I was safely conducted to Jamestown\".<ref name=\"Letter to Queen Anne\">{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Caleb|title=John Smith's Letter to Queen Anne regarding Pocahontas|url=http://members.aol.com/mayflo1620/pocahontas.html|website=Mayflower Web Pages|accessdate=13 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616092056/http://members.aol.com/mayflo1620/pocahontas.html|archivedate=June 16, 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn 1860, Boston businessman and historian Charles Deane was the first scholar to question specific details of Smith's writings. Smith's version of events is the only source and skepticism has increasingly been expressed about its veracity. One reason for such doubt is that, despite having published two earlier books about Virginia, Smith's earliest surviving account of his rescue by Pocahontas dates from 1616, nearly 10 years later, in a letter entreating [[Anne of Denmark|Queen Anne]] to treat Pocahontas with dignity.<ref name=\"Letter to Queen Anne\"/> The time gap in publishing his story raises the possibility that Smith may have exaggerated or invented the event to enhance Pocahontas' image. However, professor Leo Lemay of the University of Delaware points out that Smith's earlier writing was primarily geographical and ethnographic in nature and did not dwell on his personal experiences; hence, there was no reason for him to write down the story until this point.<ref>Lemay, J. A. Leo. ''Did Pocahontas Save Captain John Smith?'' Athens, Georgia: The University of Georgia Press, 1992, p. 25. Lemay's other arguments in favour of Smith are summarized in Birchfield, [http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html 'Did Pocahontas'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626175132/http://vision.stanford.edu/~birch/pocahontas.html |date=26 June 2012 }}.</ref>\n\n[[Henry Brooks Adams]] attempted to debunk Smith's claims of heroism. He said that Smith's recounting of the story of Pocahontas had been progressively embellished, made up of \"falsehoods of an effrontery seldom equaled in modern times\". There is consensus among historians that Smith tended to exaggerate, but his account is consistent with the basic facts of his life.<ref>[[Jill Lepore|Lepore, Jill]], \"The New Yorker\", 2 April 2007, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Some have suggested that Smith believed that he had been rescued, when he had in fact been involved in a ritual intended to symbolize his death and rebirth as a member of the tribe.<ref>Gleach, ''Powhatan's World'', pp. 118\u201321.; Kupperman, ''Indians and English'', pp. 114, 174.</ref><ref>{{Cite book | author=Horwitz, Tony | title=A Voyage Long and Strange: Rediscovering the New World | publisher=Henry Holt and Co. | isbn=978-0-8050-7603-5 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/voyagelongstrang00horw/page/336 336] | url=https://archive.org/details/voyagelongstrang00horw/page/336 | date=29 April 2008 }}</ref> David A.

[[Karen Kupperman]] suggests that he \"presented those remembered events from decades earlier\" when telling the story of Pocahontas.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/jamestownproject00kupp <!-- quote=The Jamestown Project. --> Karen Ordahl Kupperman, ''The Jamestown Project''], Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2007, 51\u201360, 125\u20136</ref> Whatever really happened, the encounter initiated a friendly relationship between the Indians and the colonists at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]. As the colonists expanded farther, some of the tribes felt that their lands were threatened, and conflicts arose again.\n\nIn 1608, Pocahontas is said to have saved Smith a second time. Chief Powhatan invited Smith and some other colonists to Werowocomoco on friendly terms, but Pocahontas came to the hut where they were staying and warned them that Powhatan was planning to kill them. They stayed on their guard and the attack never came.<ref>Symonds, ''Proceedings'', pp. 251\u20132; Smith, ''Generall Historie'', pp. 198\u20139, 259.</ref> Also in 1608, Polish craftsmen were brought to the colony to help it develop.

These explorations are commemorated in the [[Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic Trail]], established in 2006. In his absence, Smith left his friend [[Matthew Scrivener]] as governor in his place, a young gentleman adventurer from Sibton [[Suffolk]] who was related by marriage to the Wingfield family, but he was not capable of leading the people.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Smith was elected president of the local council in September 1608.<ref name=\"books.google.com\"/>\n\n===Influx of settlers===\nSome of the settlers eventually wanted Smith to abandon Jamestown, but he refused. Some deserted to the Indian villages, but Powhatan's people also followed Smith's law of \"he who works not, eats not\". This lasted \"till they were near starved indeed\", in Smith's words, and they returned home.<ref name=SnellCh4 />\n\nIn the spring of 1609, Jamestown was beginning to prosper, with many dwellings built, acres of land cleared, and much other work done. Then in April, they experienced an infestation of rats, along with dampness which destroyed all their stored corn. They needed food badly and Smith sent a large group of settlers to fish and others to gather shellfish downriver. They came back without food and were willing enough to take the meager rations offered them. This angered Smith and he ordered them to trade their guns and tools for fruit from the Indians and ordered everyone to work or be banished from the fort.<ref name=snch4p85 />\n\nThe weeks-long emergency was relieved by the arrival of an unexpected ship captained by [[Samuel Argall]]. He had items of food and wine which Smith bought on credit. Argall also brought news that the Virginia Company of London was being reorganized and was [[Jamestown supply missions|sending more supplies and settlers]] to Jamestown, along with [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr|Lord De la Warr]] to become the new governor.<ref name=snch4p85 />\n[[File:John Smith taking the King of Pamavnkee prisoner - etching.jpg|thumb|right|John Smith taking the King of Pamunkey prisoner (1624 history)]]\n\nIn a May 1609 voyage to Virginia, Virginia Company treasurer [[Thomas Smythe|Sir Thomas Smith]] arranged for about 500 colonists to come along, including women and children. A fleet of nine ships set sail. One sank in a storm soon after leaving the harbour, and the ''[[Sea Venture]]'' wrecked on the Bermuda Islands with flotilla admiral Sir [[George Somers]] aboard. They finally made their way to Jamestown in May 1610 after building the ''Deliverance'' and ''Patience'' to take most of the passengers and crew of the ''Sea Venture'' off Bermuda, with the new governor [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]] on board.<ref>{{harvnb|Snell|1974|loc=Ch. 4|p=91}}</ref>\n\nIn August 1609, Smith was quite surprised to see more than 300 new settlers arrive, which did not go well for him. London was sending new settlers with no real planning or logistical support.<ref name=SnellCh4 /> Then in May 1610, Somers and Gates finally arrived with 150 people from the ''Sea Venture''. Gates soon found that there was not enough food to support all in the colony and decided to abandon Jamestown.

He never returned to Virginia.<ref name=SnellCh4 /> Colonists continued to die from various illnesses and disease, with an estimated 150 surviving that winter out of 500 residents. The Virginia Company, however, continued to finance and transport settlers to sustain Jamestown.

He escaped after weeks of captivity and made his way back to England, where he published an account of his two voyages as ''[[A Description of New England]]''. He remained in England for the rest of his life.\n\nSmith compared his experiences in Virginia with his observations of New England and offered a theory of why some English colonial projects had failed. He noted that the French had been able to monopolize trade in a very short time, even in areas nominally under English control. The people inhabiting the coasts from Maine to Cape Cod had \"large corne fields, and great troupes of well proportioned people\", but the French had obtained everything that they had to offer in trade within six weeks.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|1616|p=26}} reprinted in {{harvnb|Arber|1910|p=I:205}}.</ref> This was due to the fact that the French had created a great trading network which they could exploit, and the English had not cultivated these relations.

The original monument was built in 1864 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of Smith's visit to what he named Smith's Isles. It was a series of square granite slabs atop one another, with a small granite pillar at the top. (See the postcard to the right.)

Most of the skepticism is a result of the differences between his narratives. His earliest text is ''A True Relation of Virginia'', which was submitted for publication in 1608, the year after his experiences in Jamestown. The second was ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'', published in 1624. Publishing letters, journals, and pamphlets from the colonists was regulated by the companies that sponsored the voyage, in that they must go \"directly to the company\" because no one was to \"write any letter of anything that may discourage others\". Smith violated this regulation by first publishing ''A True Relation'' as an unknown author.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=40}} Leo Lemay theorizes that the editor of ''The Generall Historie'' might have cut out \"references to the Indians' hostility, to bickering among the leaders of Virginia Company, and to the early supposed mutiny\" of Smith on the voyage to Virginia.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=41}}\n\n[[File:Generall Historie of Virginia.jpg|thumb|''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'' by Capt. John Smith, 1624]] \n[[File:John Smith 1624 map of Bermuda with Forts 01.jpg|thumb|Smith's 1624 map of the Somers Isles (Bermuda) showing [[St. George's, Bermuda|St. George's Town]] and related fortifications, including the [[Castle Islands Fortifications, Bermuda|Castle Islands Fortifications]]]]\n\nThe Pocahontas episode is subject to the most scrutiny by critics, for it does not appear in ''A True Relation'' but does in ''The Generall Historie''. According to Lemay, important evidence of Smith's credibility is the fact that \"no one in Smith's day ever expressed doubt\" concerning the story's veracity, and many people who would have known the truth \"were in London in 1616 when Smith publicised the story in a letter to the queen\", including Pocahontas herself.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=51}}\n\nSmith focuses heavily on Indians in all of his works concerning the New World. His relationship with the Powhatan tribe was an important factor in preserving the Jamestown colony from sharing the fate of the [[Roanoke colony]].\n\n<blockquote>Realizing that the very existence of the colony depended on peace, he never thought of trying to exterminate the natives. Only after his departure were there bitter wars and massacres, the natural results of a more hostile policy. In his writings, Smith reveals the attitudes behind his actions.<ref>Randel, William. \"Captain John Smith's Attitudes toward the Indians\". The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography (1939): 218\u2013229. p. 219</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Promoter of American colonization===\n{{one source|section|date=August 2019}}\n[[File:Capt John Smith's map of Virginia 1624.jpg|thumb|right|270px|Smith's map of Virginia from ''[[The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles]]'', 1624]]\nOne of Smith's main incentives in writing about his New World experiences and observances was to promote English colonization. Lemay claims that many promotional writers sugar-coated their depictions of America in order to heighten its appeal, but he argues that Smith was not one to exaggerate the facts. He argues that Smith was very straightforward with his readers about both the dangers and the possibilities of colonization. Instead of proclaiming that there was an abundance of gold in the New World, as many writers did, Smith illustrated that there was abundant monetary opportunity in the form of industry.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=80}} Lemay argues that no motive except wealth would attract potential colonists away from \"their ease and humours at home\".<ref>Smith, John. \"A Description of New England\". ''The Heath Anthology of American Literature''. Ed. Paul Lauter. 6th Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company, 2009 [1616]. p. 282</ref> \"Therefore, he presented in his writings actual industries that could yield significant capital within the New World: fishing, farming, shipbuilding, and fur trading\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=91}}\n\nSmith insists, however, that only hard workers would be able to reap the benefits of wealth which the New World afforded. He did not understate the dangers and toil associated with colonization. He declared that only those with a strong work ethic would be able to \"live and succeed in America\" in the face of such dangers.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=81}}\n\n===Additional works===\n''A Map of Virginia'' is focused centrally on the observations that Smith made about the Native Americans, particularly regarding their religion and government. This specific focus would have been Smith's way of adapting to the New World by assimilating the best parts of their culture and incorporating them into the colony. ''A Map of Virginia'' was not just a pamphlet discussing the observations that Smith made, but also a map which Smith had drawn himself, to help make the Americas seem more domestic. As Lemay remarks, \"maps tamed the unknown, reduced it to civilisation and harnessed it for Western consciousness,\" promoting Smith's central theme of encouraging the settlement of America.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=42}} Many \"naysayers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century\" have made the argument that Smith's maps were not reliable because he \"lacked a formal education in cartography\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=43}} That allegation, however, was proved false by the fact that Smith was a \"master in his chosen fields of experience\".{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=43}}\n\n''[https://web.archive.org/web/20141220105044/http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/world_civ/worldcivreader/world_civ_reader_2/john_smith.html The Proceedings of the English Colony In Virginia]'' was a compilation of other writings; it narrates the colony's history from December 1609 to the summer of 1610, and Smith left the colony in October 1609 due to a gunpowder accident. The writing style of ''The Proceedings'' is thought to be better constructed than ''A Map of Virginia''.{{sfn|Lemay|1991|p=48}}\n\n==Publications==\nJohn Smith published eight volumes during his life.

This is usually due to lack of compliance with postal regulations, an incomplete address and [[return address]], or the inability to [[mail forwarding|forward the mail]] when both correspondents move before the letter can be delivered. Largely based on the British model that emerged in the late eighteenth century, many countries developed similar systems for processing undeliverable mail.\n\nThe term 'dead mail' is perhaps a misnomer, and several jurisdictions have opted for the use of the term 'undeliverable mail' as more clearly representing the status of the item whose transmission has been impeded. As it is performed by internal departments within postal administrations, little information about the dead letter office function has ever been made public. A few journal articles and at least one recently published book (Canadian) dealing with this topic have appeared.<ref>{{cite book |last=Plain |first=Brian C. |title=The dead letter office in Canada, 1830-2002: an illustrated postal history |edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=British North America Philatelic Society |location=Surrey, BC   |isbn=0-919854-88-5 |oclc= 84985892|pages=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Allison  | first = Sue  | title = No Return Address | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/no-return-address-29982057/ | journal = Smithsonian  | volume = 31  | issue = 4  | date = July 2000  | accessdate = 2017-02-17 }}</ref>\n\nClassification as a dead letter is one of the few instances where postal personnel are allowed to violate [[secrecy of correspondence]], ostensibly to search for clues as to the letter's origin or destination. Countries must also set up regulations for the disposal of dead letters, particularly when they contain items of value.  Some very valuable items have turned up in undeliverable mail, including a stolen painting by [[Marc Chagall]] which turned up in a [[United States Postal Service]] sorting center in [[Topeka, Kansas]] in January, 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Real Chagall |work=USPS Memo to Mailers |publisher=[[USPS]] |date=March 2002 |url=http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |accessdate=2009-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606083631/http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |archivedate=2002-06-06 }}</ref>\n\nWith increased collection and study of the [[postal marking]]s originating from such offices, the body of literature on this obscure topic may grow.  Many countries, including [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], have issued special labels for envelopes that have travelled through the dead letter office.  Genuinely used examples are highly prized by collectors, although mint labels, because they have no postage value, are often fairly common.\n\nPeople interested in [[Mail|postal service]]s throughout the world sometimes deliberately send mail to fictional addresses throughout the world to see if a particular nation's postal authority would return the mail to the sender. Collectors of postal markings also use this method in order to receive uncommon postal markings seldom seen in everyday mail.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Dead letter office==\n{{about|the postal facility|the album by R.E.M.|Dead Letter Office (album)|the film|Dead Letter Office (film)|section=TRUE}}\n[[File:Dead letter office.png|right|thumb|Dead letter office, probably in [[Washington, D.C.]]; September 1922]]\n\nA '''dead letter office''' ('''DLO''') is a facility within a [[mail|postal system]] where [[Dead letter mail|undeliverable mail]] is processed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Patrick|first1=Douglas & Mary|title=The Musson Stamp Dictionary|date=1973|publisher=Musson Book Company|location=[[Toronto]]|isbn=0773700064|page=[https://archive.org/details/mussonstampdicti00doug/page/64 64]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mussonstampdicti00doug/page/64}}</ref> Mail is considered to be undeliverable when the address is invalid so it cannot be delivered to the addressee, and there is no [[return address]] so it cannot be returned to the sender.\n\nAt a DLO, mail is usually opened to try to find an address to forward to.

A few journal articles and at least one recently published book (Canadian) dealing with this topic have appeared.<ref>{{cite book |last=Plain |first=Brian C. |title=The dead letter office in Canada, 1830-2002: an illustrated postal history |edition=2nd|year=2006|publisher=British North America Philatelic Society |location=Surrey, BC   |isbn=0-919854-88-5 |oclc= 84985892|pages=148}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last = Allison  | first = Sue  | title = No Return Address | url = http://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/no-return-address-29982057/ | journal = Smithsonian  | volume = 31  | issue = 4  | date = July 2000  | accessdate = 2017-02-17 }}</ref>\n\nClassification as a dead letter is one of the few instances where postal personnel are allowed to violate [[secrecy of correspondence]], ostensibly to search for clues as to the letter's origin or destination. Countries must also set up regulations for the disposal of dead letters, particularly when they contain items of value.  Some very valuable items have turned up in undeliverable mail, including a stolen painting by [[Marc Chagall]] which turned up in a [[United States Postal Service]] sorting center in [[Topeka, Kansas]] in January, 2002.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Real Chagall |work=USPS Memo to Mailers |publisher=[[USPS]] |date=March 2002 |url=http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |accessdate=2009-10-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020606083631/http://www.usps.com/memotomailers/march2002.htm |archivedate=2002-06-06 }}</ref>\n\nWith increased collection and study of the [[postal marking]]s originating from such offices, the body of literature on this obscure topic may grow.  Many countries, including [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], have issued special labels for envelopes that have travelled through the dead letter office.  Genuinely used examples are highly prized by collectors, although mint labels, because they have no postage value, are often fairly common.\n\nPeople interested in [[Mail|postal service]]s throughout the world sometimes deliberately send mail to fictional addresses throughout the world to see if a particular nation's postal authority would return the mail to the sender. Collectors of postal markings also use this method in order to receive uncommon postal markings seldom seen in everyday mail.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\n==Dead letter office==\n{{about|the postal facility|the album by R.E.M.|Dead Letter Office (album)|the film|Dead Letter Office (film)|section=TRUE}}\n[[File:Dead letter office.png|right|thumb|Dead letter office, probably in [[Washington, D.C.]]; September 1922]]\n\nA '''dead letter office''' ('''DLO''') is a facility within a [[mail|postal system]] where [[Dead letter mail|undeliverable mail]] is processed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Patrick|first1=Douglas & Mary|title=The Musson Stamp Dictionary|date=1973|publisher=Musson Book Company|location=[[Toronto]]|isbn=0773700064|page=[https://archive.org/details/mussonstampdicti00doug/page/64 64]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/mussonstampdicti00doug/page/64}}</ref> Mail is considered to be undeliverable when the address is invalid so it cannot be delivered to the addressee, and there is no [[return address]] so it cannot be returned to the sender.\n\nAt a DLO, mail is usually opened to try to find an address to forward to.
