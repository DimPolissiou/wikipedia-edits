The town is integrated with different types of tribes: [[Kunama people|Kunama]], [[Nara people|Nara]], [[Tigre people|Tigre]] and [[Tigrinya]] being the dominant.\n\n==History==\nIt was mainly inhabited by the [[Nilotic]] [[Kunama people]] and Nara people in the past. The Nara people leader Shekaray Agaba was the first to build the town Umba Arenku which it means the white water. It is located in the [[Gash-Barka]] Zone of Eritrea. Barentu is the  largest town in the Gash-Barka Zone in Eritrea, lying west of Asmara. It is the capital of the Gash-Barka and home of the Nara and Kunama Ethnic groups.\n\n[[File:Barentu2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Local people on a street in Barentu]]\n\nThe town has typically been a center of mining and agricultural activities for the area. During the [[Eritrean War of Independence]] the town was [[Siege of Barentu|besieged]]. As part of the [[Eritrean-Ethiopian War]] of 1998-2000, the then flourishing town suffered major damage but has since undergone reconstruction. Thus it now attracts settlers from all parts of the country especially from the Gash area and the Eritrean highlands. Owing to this factor the town has expanded rapidly in the last decade. This rapid expansion is also partly attributed to the Eritrean returnees from [[Sudan]] who established their home in the town after years of migration spent in Sudan.\n\n==Geography==\n===Overview===\nBarentu is the administrative center of [[Barentu Subregion]]; has basic electricity services, a hospital and a clinic. The town consists of 3 administrative quarters or zobas (as they are called in tigrigna) namely zoba Fthi [\u134d\u1275\u1212], Selam [\u1230\u120b\u121d] and Biara [\u1262\u12eb\u122b].  \n\nNearby towns and villages include [[Tauda]] ({{convert|8.0|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Alegada]] ({{convert|6.9|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Dedda]] ({{convert|7.2|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Augana]] ({{convert|3.2|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|disp=or}}), [[Cona, Eritrea|Cona]] ({{convert|5.7|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|disp=or}}) and [[Daghilo]] ({{convert|7.8|nmi|km|order=flip|abbr=on|disp=or}}), Mogolo, Kofa Arenku, Arada Tarkina and Lemesa.\n\n===Climate===\nIts climate is [[Semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]]: BSh), warm during summer and cold during winter. Its climate is favorable for different types of crops, fruits, vegetables and a large variety of animals flourish in the region.\n\n==Economy==\nIt is one of the fastest growing cities in the country. It acts as a hub for the surrounding agricultural areas, as a center for trade and exchange of commodities owing to its location in the center of the Gash Barka region.\n\nThe town is not only growing fast but it is also developing with the scale, and it have been able to provide basic services, such transport, education, health facilities and all that coupled with a fine weather. The town gets very active on the weekly market days which host farmers, traders and livestock herders who all come to the town on Thursday and Saturday from surrounding villages to sell their produce and in return purchase commodities and goods to take back home. Products which come from the villages include crops such as sorghum, millet and sesame. Live stocks such as cows, camels, sheep and goats fill the market with active sense of exchange especially when it is near the holidays. \n\n==Culture==\nBarentu is inhabited by the [[Kunama people|Kunama]] and the [[Nara people|Nara]] peoples. Religiously, the city has adherents of the [[Eritrean Orthodox Tewahedo Church]], the [[Eritrean Catholic Church]], and [[Religion_in_Eritrea#Islam|Islam]], as well as practitioners of the indigenous Kunama and Nara traditional beliefs.\n\nTraditional Kunama religion is [[monotheistic]], with worship of the goddess ''Anna''. The name ''Anna'' appears in many phrases of the [[Kunama language]], such as \"''Annam koske''\" (\"God exists, sees and judges\"), \"''Anna laga''\" (lit. \"God\u2019s world\", i.e., \"the universe belongs to God\"), and \"''Anna hedabu''\" (\"God willing\").<ref>{{cite web |title=Religions in Eritrea, Part 4 |url=http://www.baden-kunama.com/beliefs-RELIGIONS%20IN%20ERITREA%20Part%204%20(RKPHA%202001).html |website=BadenKunama |publisher=The RKPHA |accessdate=28 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nEducation is supplied by a number of elementary and junior high schools, and one high school. Schools teach in [[Kunama language|Kunama]], [[Nara language|Nara]], [[Modern Standard Arabic]], [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], and English.\n\n==Transport==\nTransport wise Barentu is a hub that connects different parts of the country and it has asphalt roads connecting it with Asmara, Keren, Tessenei, Haikota and Agordat, dirt roads connect with smaller towns like Tokombia, and Shambuqo. Due to its location the town is busy with travellers from all over the region.

The other thirty-two churches and their congregations represented the nucleus from which the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Thozhiyur Church, Thoma Syrian (Reformed Syrians), and Syro-Malankara Catholic Church have originated.<ref>Catholic Encyclopedia profile of \"St. Thomas Christians\" - The Carmelite Period</ref>\n\nIn 1665 [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Gregorios]], a Bishop sent by the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], arrived in India. The independent group under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India\"</ref> Though most of the St. Thomas Christians gradually relented in their strong opposition to the Western control, the arrival of the Bishop [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Gregorios]] of the Syriac Orthodox Church in 1665 marked the beginning of a formal schism among the St. Thomas Christians. Those who accepted the West Syriac liturgical tradition of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch of Gregorios became known as the Puthenkoor; they also continued to use the name \"Malankara\", the real name of the St. Thomas Christian community for the church. Those who joined the communion of Rome after the Synod of Daimper and remained in the communion even after the oath of bent cross, and those who joined the Catholic communion from the Puhenkoor Malankara church during the Carmelite period, came to be known as the '''Syro Malabar Church''' from the last decade of the Nineteenth century onwards.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Some of the churches not joined in the Angamaly Padiyola (1787) later became Latin churches, e.g. Mathilakom (Pappinivattom), Maliankara, Thuruthipuram, etc. One branch of the Syro Malabar Catholic church later left to form the Assyrian Church of the East aligned with [[Chaldean Syrian Church]] when an Eastern Syriac rite bishop, Gabriel, came to evangelize them in 1701. Kottayam Cheriapally was the headquarters of Gabriel.\n\n==Post-Coonan Cross Oath==\nThe Syro-Malabar Church descends from the part of the community known as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\", that after the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] in 1653 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]] entered in formal communion with the [[Holy See]] of Rome again (which first happened after the Synod of diamper) due to the reconciliation efforts of [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] (O.C.D.) missionaries sent by [[Pope Alexander VII]] (1665\u201367). Latin Catholic Carmelite clergy from Europe served as bishops, and the Church along with the Latin Catholics was under the [[Apostolic Vicariate]] of Malabar (modern-day [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Verapoly]]). As per [[Paremmakkal Thoma Kathanar]]'s travelogue [[Varthamanappusthakam]] (dated to 1790), the Church was known then as the ''Malankare Kaldaya Suriyani Sabha'' \"Malankara Chaldean Syriac Church\". In 1887, the Holy See established two [[Apostolic Vicariate]]s, [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Thrissur|Thrissur]] and [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Changanassery|Kottayam]] (later Changanassery) under the guidance of indigenous Syro-Malabar bishops, and named the Church as \"The Syro-Malabar Church\" to distinguish them from the Latins.<ref name=\"Nedumparambil\">{{cite web|author=George Joseph Nedumparambil|date=2013|title=A Search of the Roots of the Syro-Malabar Church in Kerala|url=https://opus.bibliothek.uni-wuerzburg.de/opus4-wuerzburg/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/6595/file/Joseph_Nedumparambil.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2019|publisher=University of W\u00fcrzburg}}</ref> The Holy See re-organized the Apostolic Vicariates in 1896 into three Apostolic Vicariates ([[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Thrissur|Thrissur]], [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Major Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly|Ernakulam]], and [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Changanassery|Changanassery]]). A fourth Apostolic Vicariate ([[Syro-Malabar Catholic Archeparchy of Kottayam|Kottayam]]) was established in 1911 for [[Knanaya]] Catholics. In 1923, [[Pope Pius XI]] (1922\u201339) set up a full-fledged Syro-Malabar hierarchy with [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Major Archeparchy of Ernakulam-Angamaly|Ernakulam-Angamaly]] as the [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|Metropolitan See]] and [[Augustine Kandathil]] as the first [[Major archbishop|Head and Archbishop]] of the Church.

To represent their position, Kerala's Syrian Catholics [[Mar Joseph Kariattil|Joseph Kariattil]] and [[Paremmakkal Thomma Kathanar]] went to [[Rome]] in 1778. While they were in Europe, Kariatty Joseph Kathanar was installed in Portugal as the Archbishop of [[Kodungalloor]] Archdiocese.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} While journeying home, they stayed in [[Goa]] where Kariattil died before he could formally take charge. Before he died, Kariattil appointed Kathanar as the Administrator of Kodungalloor Archdiocese after him. The new administrator ran the affairs of the church establishing his headquarters at [[Angamaly]]. In 1790, the headquarters of the Archdiocese was shifted to [[Vadayar]], dodging the invasion of [[Tippu Sultan]]. In the last four years of his life, Thomma Kathanar managed church administration from his own parish, [[Ramapuram, Kottayam|Ramapuram]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nAfter being under Babylonian [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (with Catholic faction known as [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] from 1681) bishops earlier, and under [[Latin Catholic Church|Latin Catholic]] bishops from 1599, Catholics of St. Thomas Christians obtained their own bishops from 1896.

They were known as the Catholic Syrians or Romo-Syrians to differentiate them from the Orthodox Syrians and [[Latin Church]] Catholics in Kerala. They came to be known as the Syro Malabar Catholics from 1932 onwards to differentiate them from the Syro-Malankara Catholics in Kerala.

During the celebration of the Qurbana, priests and deacons put on elaborate vestments which are unique to the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.\n\n===Restoration of East Syriac liturgy===\n[[File:Mar George Cardinal Alencherry.jpg|thumb|Metropolitan and Gate of all India Geevarghese metropolitan, Successor of Marthoma Sleeha (St. Thomas Apostle).]]\n[[File:Crowning in Syro-Malabar Nasrani Wedding by Mar Gregory Karotemprel.jpg|thumb|Crowning Ceremony during a Syro-Malabar wedding]]\n[[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] [[liturgy]] has three [[Anaphora (liturgy)|anaphorae]]: those of [[Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari|the Holy Apostles]] (Saints [[Addai]] and [[Saint Mari|Mari]]), [[Nestorius]], and [[Theodore the Interpreter]]. The first is the most popularly and extensively used. The second was traditionally used on the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] and the feasts of [[St. John the Baptist]] and of the [[Greek Doctor]]s, both of which occur in Epiphany-tide on the Wednesday of the Rogation of the Ninevites, and on Maundy Thursday. The third is used (except when the second is ordered) from [[Advent]] to [[Palm Sunday]]. The same pro-anaphoral part serves for all three.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was a movement for better understanding of the liturgical rites. A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1957, and for the first time on the feast of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] on 3 July 1962, the vernacular, [[Malayalam]], was introduced for the celebration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana.<ref>The Origin and Progress of the Syro-Malabar Hierarchy By Varkey J. Vithayathil</ref> Currently they celebrate the Divine [[Liturgy of Addai and Mari]] and the Anaphora of Theodre in mostly Malayalam, with Syriac and English influences.\n\nBesides the '''Anaphora of Addai and Mari''' being used currently in Syro-Malabar liturgy, there are two more anaphorae known as Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius. That the Anaphora of Theodore which was withdrawn from use after the Synod of Diamper(a large number of churches used it up to 1896) is being used again in the Syro-Malabar Church after 415 years is indeed an important historical reality. In a way the Syro-Malabar church rejected the [[Synod of Diamper]]. Pope Pius XII during the process of restoration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana in 1957 had requested the restoration of the Anaphorae of Theodore and Nestorius. The draft of the Anaphora of Theodore was restored after meticulous study by the Central Liturgical Committee, Liturgical Research Centre, various sub-committees, and the eparchial liturgical commissions. Many changes befitting to the times have been made in the prayers maintaining maximum fidelity to the original text of the Second Anaphora.  It was this text so prepared that was sent to Rome for the recognition of the Apostolic See in accordance with the decision of the Syro-Malabar Synod. The Congregation for the Eastern Churches gave its approval for using this anaphora on an experimental basis for three years on 15 December 2012.<ref>Official Website</ref>\n\nAfter almost 420 years, the Anaphora of Nestorius is restored in the Syro-Malabar Church.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.syromalabarchurch.in/news_details.php?news=9670|title=Syro Malabar News Updates|last=|first=|date=|website=www.syromalabarchurch.in|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> The aftermath of the so-called Synod of Diamper was that any texts related to Nestorius were systematically burnt by the Jesuits, who represented and ruled the Latin Church of India in 1599. In a way, the SyroMalabar church rejected the Synod of Diamber (Udayamperoor) by restoring the Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius.\n\nThe [[Liturgical latinisation|Latinization]] of the Syro-Malabar rite churches was brought to a head when in 1896 [[Wladyslaw Michal Zaleski|Ladislaus Zaleski]], the [[Apostolic Delegate]] to [[India]], requested permission to translate the [[Roman Pontifical]] into [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. This was the choice of some Malabar prelates, who chose it over the [[East Syriac Rite]] and [[West Syriac Rite]] [[pontificals]]. A large number of Syro-Malabarians were Assyrian schismatics at that time and various problems and concerns delayed the approval of this translation, until in 1934 [[Pope Pius XI]] stated that Latinization was no longer to be encouraged among [[Eastern Rite Catholics]].<ref>The Synod of Diamper and the Liturgy Jacob Vellian The Synod of Diamper Revisited, George Nedugatt, ed.</ref> He initiated a process of liturgical reform that sought to restore the [[oriental]] nature of the Latinized Syro-Malabar rite.<ref>A Study of the Syro-Malabar Liturgy (George Vavanikunnel)</ref> A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by Pius XII in 1957 and introduced in 1962.\n\nThe church uses one of several [[Bible translations into Malayalam]].\n\n===Liturgical calendar===\n[[File:Syro-Malabar Liturgical Calendar-2008.jpg|thumb|right|Syro-Malabar liturgical calendar]]\nSyro Malabar Church has its own [[liturgical year]].

Menezes held the [[Synod of Diamper]] in 1599 to bring the Thomas Christians under the authority of the Archbishopric of Goa.

The ancient or the independent church body was termed as the ''Puthenkuttukar'', or \"Party who is renewed (after shedding the catholic heresy)\", and resisted the authority of the Portuguese padroado. Under the leadership of metropolitan [[Mar Thoma I]] the ancient [[Malankara Church]] later entered into a new relationship with the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of [[Antioch]].<ref name=Gregorios285>Gregorios & Roberson, p. 285.</ref><ref name=Vadakkekara91>Vadakkekara, p. 91.</ref>\n\n==Coonan Cross Oath==\nA protest took place in 1653 with the [[Coonan Cross Oath]]. Under the leadership of Archdeacon Thomas, the Thomas Christians publicly took an oath that they would not obey the Jesuit Bishops or the Pope.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Eugene Cardinal Tisserant, \"Eastern Christianity in India\"</ref> Church historian KOOTHUR observes that \"the \u2018Coonan Cross\u2019 revolution obviously was the final outbreak of the storm that had been gathering on the horizon of the ecclesial life of the St. Thomas Christians for over a century.\"\n\nRome sent Carmelites in two groups from the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Propagation of the Faith]] to Malabar headed by Fr. Sebastiani and Fr. Hyacinth. Fr. Sebastiani arrived first in 1655 and began to speak directly with the metropolitan, Mar Thoma I. Fr. Sebastiani, with the help of Portuguese, gained the support of many, especially with the support of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]], Kadavil Chandy Kathanar and Vengoor Geevarghese Kathanar . These were the three of the four counselors of Thoma I, who had defected with Francisco Garcia Mendes, SJ, Archbishop of [[Kodungallur|Cranganore]], before the arrival of Sebastaini, according to Jesuit reports.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>\n\nBetween 1661 and 1662, out of the 116 churches, the Carmelites claimed eighty-four churches, leaving the native metropolitan Thoma I with thirty-two churches. The eighty-four churches and their congregations were the body from which the Syro Malabar Catholic Church has descended. The other thirty-two churches and their congregations represented the nucleus from which the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, the Thozhiyur Church, Thoma Syrian (Reformed Syrians), and Syro-Malankara Catholic Church have originated.<ref>Catholic Encyclopedia profile of \"St. Thomas Christians\" - The Carmelite Period</ref>\n\nIn 1665 [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Gregorios]], a Bishop sent by the [[Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch]], arrived in India. The independent group under the leadership of the Archdeacon welcomed him.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Thekkedath, History of Christianity in India\"</ref> Though most of the St. Thomas Christians gradually relented in their strong opposition to the Western control, the arrival of the Bishop [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel|Gregorios]] of the Syriac Orthodox Church in 1665 marked the beginning of a formal schism among the St. Thomas Christians. Those who accepted the West Syriac liturgical tradition of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]] of Antioch of Gregorios became known as the Puthenkoor; they also continued to use the name \"Malankara\", the real name of the St. Thomas Christian community for the church. Those who joined the communion of Rome after the Synod of Daimper and remained in the communion even after the oath of bent cross, and those who joined the Catholic communion from the Puhenkoor Malankara church during the Carmelite period, came to be known as the '''Syro Malabar Church''' from the last decade of the Nineteenth century onwards.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Some of the churches not joined in the Angamaly Padiyola (1787) later became Latin churches, e.g. Mathilakom (Pappinivattom), Maliankara, Thuruthipuram, etc. One branch of the Syro Malabar Catholic church later left to form the Assyrian Church of the East aligned with [[Chaldean Syrian Church]] when an Eastern Syriac rite bishop, Gabriel, came to evangelize them in 1701. Kottayam Cheriapally was the headquarters of Gabriel.\n\n==Post-Coonan Cross Oath==\nThe Syro-Malabar Church descends from the part of the community known as ''Pazhayakuttukar'', or \"Old Party\", that after the [[Coonan Cross Oath]] in 1653 under the leadership of [[Palliveettil Mar Chandy|Palliveettil Chandy]] entered in formal communion with the [[Holy See]] of Rome again (which first happened after the Synod of diamper) due to the reconciliation efforts of [[Discalced Carmelites|Discalced Carmelite]] (O.C.D.) missionaries sent by [[Pope Alexander VII]] (1665\u201367).

To represent their position, Kerala's Syrian Catholics [[Mar Joseph Kariattil|Joseph Kariattil]] and [[Paremmakkal Thomma Kathanar]] went to [[Rome]] in 1778. While they were in Europe, Kariatty Joseph Kathanar was installed in Portugal as the Archbishop of [[Kodungalloor]] Archdiocese.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} While journeying home, they stayed in [[Goa]] where Kariattil died before he could formally take charge. Before he died, Kariattil appointed Kathanar as the Administrator of Kodungalloor Archdiocese after him. The new administrator ran the affairs of the church establishing his headquarters at [[Angamaly]]. In 1790, the headquarters of the Archdiocese was shifted to [[Vadayar]], dodging the invasion of [[Tippu Sultan]]. In the last four years of his life, Thomma Kathanar managed church administration from his own parish, [[Ramapuram, Kottayam|Ramapuram]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nAfter being under Babylonian [[Assyrian Church of the East]] (with Catholic faction known as [[Chaldean Catholic Church]] from 1681) bishops earlier, and under [[Latin Catholic Church|Latin Catholic]] bishops from 1599, Catholics of St. Thomas Christians obtained their own bishops from 1896.

They were known as the Catholic Syrians or Romo-Syrians to differentiate them from the Orthodox Syrians and [[Latin Church]] Catholics in Kerala. They came to be known as the Syro Malabar Catholics from 1932 onwards to differentiate them from the Syro-Malankara Catholics in Kerala.

During the celebration of the Qurbana, priests and deacons put on elaborate vestments which are unique to the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.\n\n===Restoration of East Syriac liturgy===\n[[File:Mar George Cardinal Alencherry.jpg|thumb|Metropolitan and Gate of all India Geevarghese metropolitan, Successor of Marthoma Sleeha (St. Thomas Apostle).]]\n[[File:Crowning in Syro-Malabar Nasrani Wedding by Mar Gregory Karotemprel.jpg|thumb|Crowning Ceremony during a Syro-Malabar wedding]]\n[[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] [[liturgy]] has three [[Anaphora (liturgy)|anaphorae]]: those of [[Holy Qurbana of Addai and Mari|the Holy Apostles]] (Saints [[Addai]] and [[Saint Mari|Mari]]), [[Nestorius]], and [[Theodore the Interpreter]]. The first is the most popularly and extensively used. The second was traditionally used on the [[Epiphany (Christian)|Epiphany]] and the feasts of [[St. John the Baptist]] and of the [[Greek Doctor]]s, both of which occur in Epiphany-tide on the Wednesday of the Rogation of the Ninevites, and on Maundy Thursday. The third is used (except when the second is ordered) from [[Advent]] to [[Palm Sunday]]. The same pro-anaphoral part serves for all three.\n\nIn the second half of the 20th century, there was a movement for better understanding of the liturgical rites. A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1957, and for the first time on the feast of [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]] on 3 July 1962, the vernacular, [[Malayalam]], was introduced for the celebration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana.<ref>The Origin and Progress of the Syro-Malabar Hierarchy By Varkey J. Vithayathil</ref> Currently they celebrate the Divine [[Liturgy of Addai and Mari]] and the Anaphora of Theodre in mostly Malayalam, with Syriac and English influences.\n\nBesides the '''Anaphora of Addai and Mari''' being used currently in Syro-Malabar liturgy, there are two more anaphorae known as Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius. That the Anaphora of Theodore which was withdrawn from use after the Synod of Diamper(a large number of churches used it up to 1896) is being used again in the Syro-Malabar Church after 415 years is indeed an important historical reality. In a way the Syro-Malabar church rejected the [[Synod of Diamper]]. Pope Pius XII during the process of restoration of the Syro-Malabar Qurbana in 1957 had requested the restoration of the Anaphorae of Theodore and Nestorius. The draft of the Anaphora of Theodore was restored after meticulous study by the Central Liturgical Committee, Liturgical Research Centre, various sub-committees, and the eparchial liturgical commissions. Many changes befitting to the times have been made in the prayers maintaining maximum fidelity to the original text of the Second Anaphora.  It was this text so prepared that was sent to Rome for the recognition of the Apostolic See in accordance with the decision of the Syro-Malabar Synod. The Congregation for the Eastern Churches gave its approval for using this anaphora on an experimental basis for three years on 15 December 2012.<ref>Official Website</ref>\n\nAfter almost 420 years, the Anaphora of Nestorius is restored in the Syro-Malabar Church.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.syromalabarchurch.in/news_details.php?news=9670|title=Syro Malabar News Updates|last=|first=|date=|website=www.syromalabarchurch.in|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-02-28}}</ref> The aftermath of the so-called Synod of Diamper was that any texts related to Nestorius were systematically burnt by the Jesuits, who represented and ruled the Latin Church of India in 1599. In a way, the SyroMalabar church rejected the Synod of Diamber (Udayamperoor) by restoring the Anaphora of Theodore and Anaphora of Nestorius.\n\nThe [[Liturgical latinisation|Latinization]] of the Syro-Malabar rite churches was brought to a head when in 1896 [[Wladyslaw Michal Zaleski|Ladislaus Zaleski]], the [[Apostolic Delegate]] to [[India]], requested permission to translate the [[Roman Pontifical]] into [[Syriac language|Syriac]]. This was the choice of some Malabar prelates, who chose it over the [[East Syriac Rite]] and [[West Syriac Rite]] [[pontificals]]. A large number of Syro-Malabarians were Assyrian schismatics at that time and various problems and concerns delayed the approval of this translation, until in 1934 [[Pope Pius XI]] stated that Latinization was no longer to be encouraged among [[Eastern Rite Catholics]].<ref>The Synod of Diamper and the Liturgy Jacob Vellian The Synod of Diamper Revisited, George Nedugatt, ed.</ref> He initiated a process of liturgical reform that sought to restore the [[oriental]] nature of the Latinized Syro-Malabar rite.<ref>A Study of the Syro-Malabar Liturgy (George Vavanikunnel)</ref> A restored Eucharistic liturgy, drawing on the original East Syriac sources, was approved by Pius XII in 1957 and introduced in 1962.\n\nThe church uses one of several [[Bible translations into Malayalam]].\n\n===Liturgical calendar===\n[[File:Syro-Malabar Liturgical Calendar-2008.jpg|thumb|right|Syro-Malabar liturgical calendar]]\nSyro Malabar Church has its own [[liturgical year]].

{"title_page": "Names for the human species", "text_new": "The [[common name]] of the [[Human|human species]] in English is historically ''[[Man (word)|man]]'' (from [[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/mann-|Germanic]]), often replaced by the Latinate ''[[:wikt:human|human]]'' (since the 16th century).\n\nIn addition to the generally accepted [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic name]] ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' ([[Latin]]: \"[[Self-awareness|sapient]] man\",  [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] 1758), other Latin-based '''names for the human species''' have been created to refer to various aspects of the human character.\n\nSome of these are ironic of the self-ascribed nobility immanent in the choice of ''sapiens'', others are serious references to [[human universal]]s that may be considered defining characteristics of the species. Most of these refer to  [[origin of language|linguistic]], [[intellect]]ual, [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[aesthetic]], [[social behavior|social]] or [[technology|technological]] abilities taken to be unique to humanity.\n\n==In the world's languages==\n{{further|Man (word)|Mannus|Manu (Hinduism)}}\n{{wiktionary|human_being#Translations}}\nThe [[Indo-European languages]] have a number of inherited terms for mankind. \nThe etymon of ''[[Man (word)|man]]'' is found in the Germanic languages, and is cognate with ''[[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]]'', the name of the [[List of protoplasts|human progenitor]] in Hindu mythology, and found in Indic terms for \"man\" (''manu\u1e63ya, manush, manava'' etc.).\n\nLatin ''homo'' is derived from an Indo-European root ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/\u01f5\u02b0m\u1e53|d\u02b0\u01f5\u02b0m-]]'' \"earth\", as it were  \"earthling\". It has cognates in Baltic (Old Prussian ''zm\u016bi''),  Germanic (Gothic ''guma'') and Celtic (Old Irish ''duine'').\nThis is comparable to the explanation given in the [[Genesis creation narrative|Genesis]] narrative to the Hebrew ''[[Adam]]'' (\u05d0\u05b8\u05d3\u05b8\u05dd) \"man\", derived from a word for \"red, reddish-brown\". Etymologically, it may be an [[Color terminology for race#Early history|ethnic or racial classification]] (after \"reddish\" skin colour contrasting with both \"white\" and \"black\"), but Genesis takes it to refer to the reddish colour of earth, as in the narrative the first man is formed from earth.<ref>[http://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=H120&t=KJV Strong's Concordance]</ref>\n\nOther Indo-European languages name man for his mortality, ''*mr\u0325t\u00f3s'' meaning \"mortal\", so in Armenian ''mard'',  Persian ''mard'',  Sanskrit ''marta'' and Greek \u03b2\u03c1\u03bf\u03c4\u03cc\u03c2 meaning \"mortal; human\".\nThis is comparable to the Semitic word for \"man\", represented by  Arabic ''[[:wikt:\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646|insan]]'' {{lang|ar|\u0625\u0646\u0633\u0627\u0646}} (cognate with Hebrew ''[[Enos (biblical figure)|\u02bcen\u014d\u0161]]'' {{lang|he|\u05d0\u05b1\u05e0\u05d5\u05b9\u05e9\u05c1\u202c}}), from a root for \"sick, mortal\".<ref>''Strong's Concordance'' [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H582&t=KJV H852], [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?strongs=H605&t=KJV H605].</ref>\nThe Arabic word  has been influential in the [[Islamic world]], and was adopted in many [[Turkic languages]].

[[Max Vasmer]], ''Russisches Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch'' (1950\u201358).</ref>\n\nThe [[Chinese character]] used in East Asian languages is \u4eba, originating as a pictogram of a human being. The reconstructed [[Old Chinese]] pronunciation of the Chinese word is /ni[\u014b]/.<ref>Baxter-Sagart reconstruction of Old Chinese (Version 1.1, 20 September 2014)</ref> A Proto-Sino-Tibetan ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Sino-Tibetan/r-mi(j)-n|r-mi(j)-n]]'' gives rise to Old Chinese /*mi\u014b/, modern Chinese \u6c11 ''m\u00edn'' \"people\" and to Tibetan \u0f58\u0f72 ''mi'' \"person, human being\".\n\nIn some tribal or band societies,\nthe local endonym is indistinguishable from the word for \"men, human beings\". \nExamples include \n[[Ainu language|Ainu]]: ''[[:wikt:\u30a2\u30a4\u30cc#Ainu|ainu]]'',\n[[Inuktitut]]: ''[[:wikt:inuk|inuk]]'', \n[[Bantu languages|Bantu]]: ''[[:wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Bantu/b\u00e0nt\u028a\u0300|bantu]]'',  \n{{lang-naq|khoe-khoe}} (etc.),\npossibly in [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]: [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''[[:wikt:magyar|magyar]]'', [[Mansi language|Mansi]] ''m\u00e4\u0144\u0107\u012b, ma\u0144\u015bi'', from a Proto-Ugric ''*ma\u0144\u0107-'' \"man, person\".\n\n==In philosophy==\nThe mixture of serious and tongue-in-cheek self-designation originates with [[Plato]], who on one hand \ndefined man as it were taxonomically as \"featherless biped\"<ref>Plato defined a human as a featherless, biped animal and was applauded. Diogenes of Sinope plucked a chicken and brought it into the lecture hall, saying: \"Here is Plato's human!\", [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]], ''Lives of Philosophers'' 6.40</ref> and on the other as {{lang|grc|\u03b6\u1ff7\u03bf\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03b9\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|z\u014don politikon}}'', as \"political\" or \"state-building animal\" ([[Aristotle]]'s term, based on Plato's ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|Statesman]]'').\n\nHarking back to Plato's ''{{lang|grc-Latn|z\u014don politikon}}'' are a number of later descriptions of man as an animal with a certain characteristic. \nNotably ''[[animal rationabile]]'' \"animal capable of rationality\", a term used in medieval [[scholasticism]] (with reference to Aristotle), and also used by e.g. [[Carl von Linn\u00e9]] 1760,{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} [[Immanuel Kant]] 1798.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\nBased on the same pattern is ''animal sociale'' or \"social animal\"{{according to whom|date=March 2015}}{{year needed|date=March 2015}}\n''animal laborans'' \"laboring animal\" ([[Hannah Arendt]] 1958<ref name=\"arendt\" />) and \n''[[animal symbolicum]]'' \"symbolizing animal\" ([[Ernst Cassirer]] 1944).\n\n==Taxonomy==\n{{main|Human taxonomy}}\n{{further|Homo|Homo sapiens}}\nThe [[binomial nomenclature|binomial name]] ''Homo sapiens'' was coined by [[Carl Linnaeus]] (1758).<ref>{{cite book|last=Linn\u00e9|first=Carl von|title=Systema natur\u00e6.

It is created by [[Jo\u00e3o Emanuel Carneiro]] and directed by Dennis Carvalho.\n\nSet in both 1999 and present time, in Bahia, ''Segundo Sol'' gives a trajectory of singer, Beto Falc\u00e3o, who is forced to fake his death in order to save his family from financial turmoil. In his new identity, named Miguel, he meets Luzia, fishmonger and a mother of two, and an estranged wife to a dead beat; they become romantically involved. Karola, Beto's ex-girlfriend and Laureta Bottini, a brothel-keeper, frame Luzia in the murder of her husband and she is forced to flee, leaving her children behind. Nearly two decades later, Luzia returns as Ariella, a DJ and tries to rebuild her life by reuniting with her children, clearing her name, and  rekindle her love story with Beto / Miguel.\n\nThe show stars [[Giovanna Antonelli]], [[Adriana Esteves]], Em\u00edlio Dantas, [[Deborah Secco]], [[Vladimir Brichta]], together with a large ensemble cast.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] in 1999, in the historic district of Santo Antonio, lives the Falc\u00e3o family. Beto, one of the four sons of Dod\u00f4 and Nana, made his fame as a singer of [[Ax\u00e9 (music)|ax\u00e9]], but for about three years he has experienced the bitter taste of ostracism. The family earns their livelihood from the crab bar in the same house where they live, but runs the risk of losing their home because of the mismanagement of Beto's career by his manager and brother Remy, the \"black sheep\" son. To help pay part of the debt, Beto agrees to perform in [[Aracaju]], when the plane he had planned to take crashes at sea and he is presumed dead. Due to the unexpected nationwide commotion, the singer is convinced by Remy and his girlfriend Karola \u2014 with whom his relationship is very shaken \u2014 to continue passing off as a deceased man by staying in the fictional island of Boipor\u00e3. It is at this moment the troubled Beto meets Luzia ([[Giovanna Antonelli]]), a fishwife, abandoned by her husband, fending alone for her young children. The two fall in love and soon make plans for marriage, without her knowing the true identity of Beto, who presents himself as Miguel. Hostage of a large plot orchestrated by Karola and Laureta ([[Adriana Esteves]]), the couple ends up separated. They find her ex-husband and he tries to kill Beto but Luzia ends up killing him. Luzia, now a fugitive, flees to [[Iceland]], with the help of Goa (Andr\u00e9 Dias) where she becomes famous as DJ Ariela.\n\n===Second phase===\nAfter nearly 20 years, Luzia returns to try to reunite her shattered family, without imagining that Miguel, her great love that she could not forget, is the famous singer Beto Falc\u00e3o. Along with his family, Beto maintains to this day the farce of his death and is unhappy with the course that life has taken. He also keeps his love for Luzia alive and goes crazy when he discovers that the fishmonger, now a successful DJ, is in Salvador and will do everything to find her and rekindle their past romances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://telepadi.folha.uol.com.br/carminha-missao-adriana-esteves-reencontra-joao-emanuel-carneiro/|title=Carminha, a miss\u00e3o: Adriana Esteves reencontra Jo\u00e3o

It is created by [[Jo\u00e3o Emanuel Carneiro]] and directed by Dennis Carvalho.\n\nSet in both 1999 and present time, in Bahia, ''Segundo Sol'' gives a trajectory of singer, Beto Falc\u00e3o, who is forced to fake his death in order to save his family from financial turmoil. In his new identity, named Miguel, he meets Luzia, fishmonger and a mother of two, and an estranged wife to a dead beat; they become romantically involved. Karola, Beto's ex-girlfriend and Laureta Bottini, a brothel-keeper, frame Luzia in the murder of her husband and she is forced to flee, leaving her children behind. Nearly two decades later, Luzia returns as Ariella, a DJ and tries to rebuild her life by reuniting with her children, clearing her name, and  rekindle her love story with Beto / Miguel.\n\nThe show stars [[Giovanna Antonelli]], [[Adriana Esteves]], Em\u00edlio Dantas, [[Deborah Secco]], [[Vladimir Brichta]], together with a large ensemble cast.\n\n==Plot==\nSet in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]] in 1999, in the historic district of Santo Antonio, lives the Falc\u00e3o family. Beto, one of the four sons of Dod\u00f4 and Nana, made his fame as a singer of [[Ax\u00e9 (music)|ax\u00e9]], but for about three years he has experienced the bitter taste of ostracism. The family earns their livelihood from the crab bar in the same house where they live, but runs the risk of losing their home because of the mismanagement of Beto's career by his manager and brother Remy, the \"black sheep\" son. To help pay part of the debt, Beto agrees to perform in [[Aracaju]], when the plane he had planned to take crashes at sea and he is presumed dead. Due to the unexpected nationwide commotion, the singer is convinced by Remy and his girlfriend Karola \u2014 with whom his relationship is very shaken \u2014 to continue passing off as a deceased man by staying in the fictional island of Boipor\u00e3. It is at this moment the troubled Beto meets Luzia ([[Giovanna Antonelli]]), a fishwife, abandoned by her husband, fending alone for her young children. The two fall in love and soon make plans for marriage, without her knowing the true identity of Beto, who presents himself as Miguel. Hostage of a large plot orchestrated by Karola and Laureta ([[Adriana Esteves]]), the couple ends up separated. They find her ex-husband and he tries to kill Beto but Luzia ends up killing him. Luzia, now a fugitive, flees to [[Iceland]], with the help of Goa (Andr\u00e9 Dias) where she becomes famous as DJ Ariela.\n\n===Second phase===\nAfter nearly 20 years, Luzia returns to try to reunite her shattered family, without imagining that Miguel, her great love that she could not forget, is the famous singer Beto Falc\u00e3o. Along with his family, Beto maintains to this day the farce of his death and is unhappy with the course that life has taken. He also keeps his love for Luzia alive and goes crazy when he discovers that the fishmonger, now a successful DJ, is in Salvador and will do everything to find her and rekindle their past romances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://telepadi.folha.uol.com.br/carminha-missao-adriana-esteves-reencontra-joao-emanuel-carneiro/|title=Carminha, a miss\u00e3o: Adriana Esteves reencontra Jo\u00e3o

She is notable as the earliest ship known from the first decades of English settlement in the [[New World]] to have survived to the present day.\n\nA rough, six week voyage ended in a storm off [[Orleans, Massachusetts]] on [[Cape Cod]] when the heavily loaded \"Sparrow-Hawk\" was driven onto the isolated Nauset Beach. All aboard survived and were removed to the nearby [[Plymouth Colony]]. Storms and shifting sand buried the wrecked pinnace within several weeks. ''Sparrow-Hawk'' remained buried until May, 1863 storms uncovered the hull which was soon salvaged. Keel, planks, rudder and other hull elements from the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' were found in good condition, removed from the beach and carefully reconstructed for subsequent exhibition.\n \n''Sparrow-Hawk'' is important to the history of ship building in England and colonies. Several of the best naval architects of the 1860s in Boston collaborated on a reconstruction which received widespread exhibition during the next few years. Considerable information has been gleaned from the ''Sparrow Hawk'' about hull design and construction of the 'small' pinnace design of the early 17th century. She is now on long-term loan from the [[Pilgrim Hall Museum|Pilgrim Society]] to the Cape Cod Maritime Museum in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts]].\n\n==Wrecked on Cape Cod==\n[[File:Sparrow-Hawk wreck site map.jpg|thumb|Wreck site of the Sparrow-Hawk in 1626 on Nauset Beach, [[Orleans, Massachusetts]]]] The ''Sparrow-Hawk'' left [[London]], June 1626 loaded with passengers for the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] Colony and [[Virginia]]. Certainly, she was of a minimum size that any Company would choose to send across the Atlantic with settlers and passengers, many of whom would be unfamiliar with the great ocean and its sometimes violent weather.<ref>For comparison, the [[Mayflower]] at 180 tons was one of the larger ships to leave England for the colonies during the early decades of the 17th century although it (the ''Mayflower'') was a relatively averaged size vessel in general 17th century terms. By contrast, the ''Ark'' which brought the Maryland Colony in 1634 was 400 tons.</ref> \nAfter six weeks, the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' reached the coast of [[Massachusetts]], and was wrecked at Potanumaquut Harbor [[Cape Cod]]. Upon reaching Cape Cod, the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' no longer had fresh water or 'beer'. Captain Johnston was in his cabin, sick and lame with scurvy. At night, the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' hit a sand bar but the water was smooth and she laid out an anchor. The morning revealed that the caulking between [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] planks - [[Oakum]] - had been driven out. High winds drove the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' over the bar and into the Harbor. Many goods were rescued and no lives were lost.\n\nTwo survivors were guided to [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]] and the [[Plimouth Plantation]] by two Indians who spoke English. A shallop with Governor Bradford and supplies to repair the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' was sent to rescue the crew. ''Sparrow-Hawk'' was repaired and set to sea with cargo. However, yet another violent storm drove her onshore, and render her condition beyond repair. Mariners and passengers removed to the Plimouth Plantation. There, they were housed and fed for nine months before joining two vessels headed down the coast to Virginia.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/yeantientwrecke100live Sparrow Hawk Ye antient wrecke.--1626 Loss of the Sparrow-Hawk in 1626], by Charles W.

Her 'grave' was a low oxygen environment which greatly aided preservation of hull timbers which were described as devoid of worms and [[barnacles]]. All metal fastenings had disappeared through [[oxidation]]. Her keel and hull timbers were visible from time to time when high winds shifted sand on the beach. Visitors were struck by the long \"tail-like\" projection from the stern. Although a single fierce storm in this area can move sand to a depth of six feet, it is judged that it took several years for the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' to be completely buried. Her burial site retained the name ''Old Ship Harbor'' into the late 19th century.<ref name=CWL/>\n\n==Rediscovery==\nIn 1863, a great storm that occurred between May 4 and May 6 uncovered a great deal of the hull. It was discovered by Solomon Linnell and Alfred Rogers of Orleans. On May 9, Leander Crosby visited the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' and removed several artifacts. The rudder was few feet distant from the hull and it was removed, studied and re-assembled. By August 1863, ''Sparrow-Hawk'' was once again buried beneath the surface for a few months after which she was exposed once again, and then removed above the [[high water]] mark.<ref name=CWL>[https://archive.org/details/yeantientwrecke100live Sparrow Hawk Ye antient wrecke.--1626 Loss of the Sparrow-Hawk in 1626], by Charles W.

The first futtocks overlap the floor-timbers about two feet, placed alongside of them, forming almost solid work on the turn of the bilge, with a glut or chock below each of them, but they were not fastened together. She has not any navel timbers. We suppose that the joints of the second futtocks overlapped in the same style as those below them. As already stated, her stem and forefoot are gone; but a part of her sternpost, and her stern-knee entire, are left. The stern-post is mortised into the keel, and has been bolted through it and the knee; but the iron has been oxidized long since. Instead of deadwood aft she has seven forked timbers, the longest four feet in the stem, with a natural branch on each side, and six inches square. Some of these were half fayed to the keel, but none of them were fastened. Through these, the planking was treenailed. Part of the keelson is now in its place; it is sided ten inches and moulded eight, and was fastened to the keel with four iron bolts, driven between the floor-timbers (not through them) into the keel.</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/yeantientwrecke100live Sparrow Hawk Ye antient wrecke.--1626. Loss of the Sparrow-Hawk in 1626], by Charles W. Livermore and Leander Crosby, Alfred Mudge & Son: Boston: 1865, p.11-12. \"Her breadth at present, at four feet two inches depth, from the outside of the timbers, is eleven feet six inches, but when planked, as already stated, it was no doubt twelve feet. She had only three strakes of ceiling, all the rest of the timbers were bare; but she had no doubt a stout clamp for her deck-beams to rest upon and partner-beams as a support to her mast. Her planking was two inches thick, of English oak, fastened with oak treenails. Most of the planks are ten inches wide. The keel has been cut to receive the lower edges of the garboards, which had been spiked to it as well as treenailed through the timbers. The [[starboard]] garboard [[strake]] is now in its place; and this is the only planking we have put on, for the other strakes are somewhat warped. Her outline, however, is perhaps more clearly defined than if she had been planked throughout. It seems to us that after her floor-timbers were laid and planked over, that the other timbers were filled in piece by piece as the planking progressed, which is still a favorite mode of building in some ports of England, and were not jointed together and raised entire before planking. By the appearance of the planks they have been scorched on the inside and then suddenly saturated in water for the purpose of bending them into shape, as a substitute for the modern mode of steaming. The planks and treenails which have not been used by us are preserved with care, and may be seen by those who wish a more minute description of her construction. We suppose she had a heavy plank sheer or covering-board, and that her deck, like her planking, was of English oak. We consider her model superior to that of many vessels of the same size and even larger, which have been recently built in [[Nova Scotia]], and which may be seen in this port every summer.\"</ref>\n\nDennison J. Lawlor was a famous Boston [[Naval architect]] who produced a line plan in which the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' had two masts. The forward mast carried a single square sail, the [[mizzen mast]] (after mast) carried a lateen sail. It was decided by a 'Mr. Sanders'  to use Lawlor's plan but reduce the depth to about 8'. Common arcs of circles replaced the sheer line with \"lively rise\" at both ends. Paintings of small square stern ships of this period show an overhang aft, instead of a flat [[Transom (nautical)|transom]], with an outboard rudder as drawn by Lawlor.  Sander's rig takes into account the [[mast step]], and thereby reduced the rig to two possibilities: 'simple' three masted; or the two-masted, square rig known in the 17th century ships as a [[Barque]].<ref name=\"pilgrimhall.org\"/>\n\n[[Image:Plymouth.Colony Sparrowhawk 1626 photo 1865  600x379.jpg|thumb|300px|Reconstructed hull of the''Sparrow-Hawk'' on the 'Commons', Boston, Massachusetts]]\nIn 1980, Baker summed up the difficulties and potential confusion when assessing a ship as a potential pinnace candidate.<ref>[http://www.pilgrimhall.org/PSNote28.htm Some Seventeenth-Century Vessels and the Sparrow-Hawk], by William Avery Baker. Pilgrim Society Note, Series One, Number 28, 1980, April 30, 2006, Plymouth Hall Museum, Plymouth Massachusetts. Historical notes about pinnaces and shallops used during the early years of the Plymouth Colony. \"The pinnace is perhaps the most confusing of all the early seventeenth-century types of vessels. Pinnace was more of a use than a type name, for almost any vessel could have been a pinnace or tender to a larger one. Generally speaking, pinnaces were lightly built, single-decked, square-sterned vessels suitable for exploring, trading, and light naval duties. On equal lengths pinnaces tended to be narrower than other types. Although primarily sailing vessels, many pinnaces carried sweeps for moving in calms or around harbors. The rigs of pinnaces ranged from the simple single-masted fore-and-aft one of staysail and sprit mainsail to the mizzenmast, and a square sprit-sail under the bowsprit.

She is notable as the earliest ship known from the first decades of English settlement in the [[New World]] to have survived to the present day.\n\nA rough, six week voyage ended in a storm off [[Orleans, Massachusetts]] on [[Cape Cod]] when the heavily loaded \"Sparrow-Hawk\" was driven onto the isolated Nauset Beach. All aboard survived and were removed to the nearby [[Plymouth Colony]]. Storms and shifting sand buried the wrecked pinnace within several weeks. ''Sparrow-Hawk'' remained buried until May, 1863 storms uncovered the hull which was soon salvaged. Keel, planks, rudder and other hull elements from the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' were found in good condition, removed from the beach and carefully reconstructed for subsequent exhibition.\n \n''Sparrow-Hawk'' is important to the history of ship building in England and colonies. Several of the best naval architects of the 1860s in Boston collaborated on a reconstruction which received widespread exhibition during the next few years. Considerable information has been gleaned from the ''Sparrow Hawk'' about hull design and construction of the 'small' pinnace design of the early 17th century. She is now on long term loan from the [[Pilgrim Hall Museum|Pilgrim Society]] to the Cape Cod Maritime Museum in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts]].\n\n==Wrecked on Cape Cod==\n[[File:Sparrow-Hawk wreck site map.jpg|thumb|Wreck site of the Sparrow-Hawk in 1626 on Nauset Beach, [[Orleans, Massachusetts]]]] The ''Sparrow-Hawk'' left [[London]], June 1626 loaded with passengers for the [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] Colony and [[Virginia]]. Certainly, she was of a minimum size that any Company would choose to send across the Atlantic with settlers and passengers, many of whom would be unfamiliar with the great ocean and its sometimes violent weather.<ref>For comparison, the [[Mayflower]] at 180 tons was one of the larger ships to leave England for the colonies during the early decades of the 17th century although it (the ''Mayflower'') was a relatively averaged size vessel in general 17th century terms. By contrast, the ''Ark'' which brought the Maryland Colony in 1634 was 400 tons.</ref> \nAfter six weeks, the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' reached the coast of [[Massachusetts]], and was wrecked at Potanumaquut Harbor [[Cape Cod]]. Upon reaching Cape Cod, the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' no longer had fresh water or 'beer'. Captain Johnston was in his cabin, sick and lame with scurvy. At night, the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' hit a sand bar but the water was smooth and she laid out an anchor. The morning revealed that the caulking between [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] planks - [[Oakum]] - had been driven out. High winds drove the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' over the bar and into the Harbor. Many goods were rescued and no lives were lost.\n\nTwo survivors were guided to [[William Bradford (Plymouth governor)|William Bradford]] and the [[Plimouth Plantation]] by two Indians who spoke English. A shallop with Governor Bradford and supplies to repair the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' was sent to rescue the crew. ''Sparrow-Hawk'' was repaired and set to sea with cargo. However, yet another violent storm drove her onshore, and render her condition beyond repair. Mariners and passengers removed to the Plimouth Plantation. There, they were housed and fed for nine months before joining two vessels headed down the coast to Virginia.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/yeantientwrecke100live Sparrow Hawk Ye antient wrecke.--1626 Loss of the Sparrow-Hawk in 1626], by Charles W.Livermore and Leander Crosby, Alfred Mudge & Son: Boston: 1865, pp 3-5.</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/accountofdiscove00otis An account of the discovery of an ancient ship on the eastern shore of Cape Cod (1864)], by Amos Otis, Albany: J.Munsell 1864: pp4-5.</ref>\n\n''Sparrow-Hawk'' was buried in the sand and marsh mud of an [[Orleans, Massachusetts]] beach that came to be known as \"Old Ship Harbor\". Her 'grave' was a low oxygen environment which greatly aided preservation of hull timbers which were described as devoid of worms and [[barnacles]]. All metal fastenings had disappeared through [[oxidation]]. Her keel and hull timbers were visible from time to time when high winds shifted sand on the beach. Visitors were struck by the long \"tail-like\" projection from the stern. Although a single fierce storm in this area can move sand to a depth of six feet, it is judged that it took several years for the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' to be completely buried. Her burial site retained the name ''Old Ship Harbor'' into the late 19th century.<ref name=CWL/>\n\n==Rediscovery==\nIn 1863, a great storm that occurred between May 4 and May 6 uncovered a great deal of the hull. It was discovered by Solomon Linnell and Alfred Rogers of Orleans. On May 9, Leander Crosby visited the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' and removed several artifacts. The rudder was few feet distant from the hull and it was removed, studied and re-assembled. By August 1863, ''Sparrow-Hawk'' was once again buried beneath the surface for a few months after which she was exposed once again, and then removed above the [[high water]] mark.<ref name=CWL>[https://archive.org/details/yeantientwrecke100live Sparrow Hawk Ye antient wrecke.--1626 Loss of the Sparrow-Hawk in 1626], by Charles W.Livermore and Leander Crosby, Alfred Mudge & Son: Boston: 1865, pp 27-9.

The first futtocks overlap the floor-timbers about two feet, placed alongside of them, forming almost solid work on the turn of the bilge, with a glut or chock below each of them, but they were not fastened together. She has not any navel timbers. We suppose that the joints of the second futtocks overlapped in the same style as those below them. As already stated, her stem and forefoot are gone; but a part of her sternpost, and her stern-knee entire, are left. The stern-post is mortised into the keel, and has been bolted through it and the knee; but the iron has been oxidized long since. Instead of deadwood aft she has seven forked timbers, the longest four feet in the stem, with a natural branch on each side, and six inches square. Some of these were half fayed to the keel, but none of them were fastened. Through these, the planking was treenailed. Part of the keelson is now in its place; it is sided ten inches and moulded eight, and was fastened to the keel with four iron bolts, driven between the floor-timbers (not through them) into the keel.</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/yeantientwrecke100live Sparrow Hawk Ye antient wrecke.--1626. Loss of the Sparrow-Hawk in 1626], by Charles W. Livermore and Leander Crosby, Alfred Mudge & Son: Boston: 1865, p.11-12. \"Her breadth at present, at four feet two inches depth, from the outside of the timbers, is eleven feet six inches, but when planked, as already stated, it was no doubt twelve feet. She had only three strakes of ceiling, all the rest of the timbers were bare; but she had no doubt a stout clamp for her deck-beams to rest upon and partner-beams as a support to her mast. Her planking was two inches thick, of English oak, fastened with oak treenails. Most of the planks are ten inches wide. The keel has been cut to receive the lower edges of the garboards, which had been spiked to it as well as treenailed through the timbers. The [[starboard]] garboard [[strake]] is now in its place; and this is the only planking we have put on, for the other strakes are somewhat warped. Her outline, however, is perhaps more clearly defined than if she had been planked throughout. It seems to us that after her floor-timbers were laid and planked over, that the other timbers were filled in piece by piece as the planking progressed, which is still a favorite mode of building in some ports of England, and were not jointed together and raised entire before planking. By the appearance of the planks they have been scorched on the inside and then suddenly saturated in water for the purpose of bending them into shape, as a substitute for the modern mode of steaming. The planks and treenails which have not been used by us are preserved with care, and may be seen by those who wish a more minute description of her construction. We suppose she had a heavy plank sheer or covering-board, and that her deck, like her planking, was of English oak. We consider her model superior to that of many vessels of the same size and even larger, which have been recently built in [[Nova Scotia]], and which may be seen in this port every summer.\"</ref>\n\nDennison J. Lawlor was a famous Boston [[Naval architect]] who produced a line plan in which the ''Sparrow-Hawk'' had two masts. The forward mast carried a single square sail, the [[mizzen mast]] (after mast) carried a lateen sail. It was decided by a 'Mr. Sanders'  to use Lawlor's plan but reduce the depth to about 8'. Common arcs of circles replaced the sheer line with \"lively rise\" at both ends. Paintings of small square stern ships of this period show an overhang aft, instead of a flat [[Transom (nautical)|transom]], with an outboard rudder as drawn by Lawlor.  Sander's rig takes into account the [[mast step]], and thereby reduced the rig to two possibilities: 'simple' three masted; or the two-masted, square rig known in the 17th century ships as a [[Barque]].<ref name=\"pilgrimhall.org\"/>\n\n[[Image:Plymouth.Colony Sparrowhawk 1626 photo 1865  600x379.jpg|thumb|300px|Reconstructed hull of the''Sparrow-Hawk'' on the 'Commons', Boston, Massachusetts]]\nIn 1980, Baker summed up the difficulties and potential confusion when assessing a ship as a potential pinnace candidate.<ref>[http://www.pilgrimhall.org/PSNote28.htm Some Seventeenth-Century Vessels and the Sparrow-Hawk], by William Avery Baker.

Pinnace was more of a use than a type name, for almost any vessel could have been a pinnace or tender to a larger one. Generally speaking, pinnaces were lightly built, single-decked, square-sterned vessels suitable for exploring, trading, and light naval duties. On equal lengths pinnaces tended to be narrower than other types. Although primarily sailing vessels, many pinnaces carried sweeps for moving in calms or around harbors. The rigs of pinnaces ranged from the simple single-masted fore-and-aft one of staysail and sprit mainsail to the mizzenmast, and a square sprit-sail under the bowsprit. To confuse matters further, however, open square-sterned pulling boats were called pinnaces at least as early as 1626.\"</ref>  There is no consensus as to what type of ship should be assigned to the ''Sparrow-Hawk''.

The Mekons were described as more chaotic version of the Gang of Four; Lycett stated the band operated on the principle that \"anybody could do it...anybody could get up and join in and instruments could be swapped around; that there'd be no distance between the audience and the band.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy their second show\u2013supporting the [[The Rezillos|Rezillos]] at the F-Club\u2013they were approached with a record deal by Bob Last of [[Fast Product]]. The Mekons would be the first band signed to the label. The band's first single was \"Never Been in a Riot\", a [[satire|satirical]] take on [[the Clash]]'s ''[[White Riot]]''. The release was made Single of the Week in [[NME]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Their second single, \"Where Were You?\" was released by the end of 1978 and sold out of its 27,500 copies. At this time, Last convinced the band to sign to a larger label\u2013[[Virgin Records|Virgin]]. The Mekons popularity peaked as they played on the same bill as other \"new music\" groups like Gang of Four, the [[The Fall (band)|Fall]], the [[The Human League|Human League]], and [[Stiff Little Fingers]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor several years the loose-knit band played noisy, bare-bones [[post-punk]], releasing singles on a variety of labels. The Mekons' first album, ''[[The Quality of Mercy Is Not Strnen]]'', was recorded using the [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]]'s instruments, and due to an error by the Virgin Records art department, featured pictures of the Gang of Four on the back cover.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nAfter 1982's ''The Mekons Story,'' a compilation of old recordings, the band ceased activity for a while, with Langford forming [[The Three Johns]]. Corrigan became a tour manager for many years before founding a company that provides visa and immigration services specialising in the entertainment industry. {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nBy the mid-1980s (revitalised by the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|1984 coal miners' strike]]) the Mekons had returned as an active group. The band was now augmented by vocalist [[Sally Timms]], violinist Susie Honeyman, ex-[[The Damned (band)|Damned]] member [[Lu Edmonds]], accordionist/vocalist [[Rico Bell]] (a.k.a. [[Eric Bellis]]), and former [[The Rumour]] drummer [[Steve Goulding]]. They began to experiment with musical styles derived from traditional English [[folk music|folk]] (tentatively explored on the ''English Dancing Master'' [[Extended play|EP]] prior to the hiatus), and American [[country music]]. ''Fear and Whiskey'' (1985), ''The Edge of the World'' (1986) and ''Honky Tonkin'' (1987) exemplified the band's new sound, which built on the innovations of [[Gram Parsons]] and blended punk ethos and [[left wing]] politics with the [[minimalism|minimalist]] country of [[Hank Williams]]. Subsequent albums, such as ''[[The Mekons Rock 'n Roll]]'', continued to experiment with diverse instrumentation (notably the [[fiddle]], [[accordion]], [[slide guitar]], and [[Ba\u011flama|saz]]).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n''The Mekons Rock and Roll'' was the band's first major label release. Issued by [[A&M Records]] in 1989, ''The Mekons Rock 'n Roll'' was not a commercial success, but it was met with critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/features/staff-lists/5882-top-100-albums-of-the-1980s/1/|title=Top 100 Albums of the 1980s|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=20 November 2002|accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stereogum.com/7175/blenders_100_greatest_indie_rock_albums_ever/franchises/list/ |title=Blender's 100 Greatest Indie-Rock Albums Ever  |accessdate=July 22, 2018}}</ref><ref name=RockNRoll_Christgau2>{{cite web |author=[[Robert Christgau|Christgau]], Robert |title=The Mekons: Rock 'n' Roll |date=24 April 2001 |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cdrev/mekonsro-not.php |accessdate=2019-12-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Handcuffed to History: \u2018The Mekons Rock \u2019N\u2019 Roll\u2019 Is 30 Years Old |author=Nelson, Elizabeth |date=18 September 2019 |publisher=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] |url=https://www.theringer.com/music/2019/9/18/20871385/mekons-rock-n-roll-30-year-anniversary |accessdate=2019-12-01}}</ref>\n\nJust as the Mekons began to grow in critical stature, their relationship with A&M Records became tense, and the Mekons were soon dropped by the label, unable to fulfill their commercial expectations.<ref name=RockNRoll_Christgau2/> However, they continued to record at a prolific rate, releasing such notable albums as 1991's ''The Curse of the Mekons'', 2000's ''Journey to the End of the Night'', and 2002's ''OOOH!''<ref name=NYTimes-Curse-1991>{{cite news|last1=Miles|first1=Milo|title=Recordings View; The Mekons Try a Little Wizardry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/19/arts/recordings-view-the-mekons-try-a-little-wizardry.html|accessdate=21 November 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=19 May 1991}}</ref> ''Natural'' moved the band to a more folk-flavoured sound.

The Mekons were described as more chaotic version of the Gang of Four; Lycett stated the band operated on the principle that \"anybody could do it...anybody could get up and join in and instruments could be swapped around; that there'd be no distance between the audience and the band.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nBy their second show\u2013supporting the [[The Rezillos|Rezillos]] at the F-Club\u2013they were approached with a record deal by Bob Last of [[Fast Product]]. The Mekons would be the first band signed to the label. The band's first single was \"Never Been in a Riot\", a [[satire|satirical]] take on [[the Clash]]'s ''[[White Riot]]''. The release was made Single of the Week in [[NME]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Their second single, \"Where Were You?\" was released by the end of 1978 and sold out of its 27,500 copies. At this time, Last convinced the band to sign to a larger label\u2013[[Virgin Records|Virgin]]. The Mekons popularity peaked as they played on the same bill as other \"new music\" groups like Gang of Four, the [[The Fall (band)|Fall]], the [[The Human League|Human League]], and [[Stiff Little Fingers]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nFor several years the loose-knit band played noisy, bare-bones [[post-punk]], releasing singles on a variety of labels. The Mekons' first album, ''[[The Quality of Mercy Is Not Strnen]]'', was recorded using the [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]]'s instruments, and due to an error by the Virgin Records art department, featured pictures of the Gang of Four on the back cover.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nAfter 1982's ''The Mekons Story,'' a compilation of old recordings, the band ceased activity for a while, with Langford forming [[The Three Johns]]. Corrigan became a tour manager for many years before founding a company that provides visa and immigration services specialising in the entertainment industry. {{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nBy the mid-1980s (revitalised by the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|1984 coal miners' strike]]) the Mekons had returned as an active group. The band was now augmented by vocalist [[Sally Timms]], violinist Susie Honeyman, ex-[[The Damned (band)|Damned]] member [[Lu Edmonds]], accordionist/vocalist [[Rico Bell]] (a.k.a. [[Eric Bellis]]), and former [[The Rumour]] drummer [[Steve Goulding]]. They began to experiment with musical styles derived from traditional English [[folk music|folk]] (tentatively explored on the ''English Dancing Master'' [[Extended play|EP]] prior to the hiatus), and American [[country music]].

Meanwhile, newer, more efficient, Classic 400 and 500 Series Boeing 737s were introduced to increase the frequency of European routes. By the middle of the decade all 727s had disappeared. To consolidate its North American operations, Royal Air Maroc purchased a single [[Boeing 747-400]]. As the decade progressed, new routes to previously under-served African airports were opened.\n\n=== 2000-present ===\nWith the increasing number of passengers and newly opened routes as well as increasing oil prices, there was a need to buy new aircraft. In 2000 an order for 20 Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft and 4 [[Airbus A321]]s was placed. Meanwhile, more routes to west and central African cities were opened.\nRAM was now changing, from providing flights to meet the demands of foreign tourists and Moroccan expatriates, to providing connections between European cities and African cities via the Casablanca hub. In 2002, the company leased two 767s to replace the single 747 in North American routes.\n\nMorocco and the EU signed an [[open skies]] agreement in late 2006. This means that Royal Air Maroc will have to face tough competition from low-cost carriers eager to exploit profitable routes between [[Western Europe]] and Morocco. A further challenge arises from the high cost of kerosene and the fact that the company may have to drop some of its unprofitable domestic and international routes.\n\nRoyal Air Maroc became [[Oneworld]]'s 14th member on 1 April 2020.<ref name=\"Royal Air Maroc to join oneworld\" /><ref name=\"AW\"/><ref name=\"Royal Air Maroc sees fleet, hub growth ahead of oneworld membership\" /><ref name=\"Royal Air Maroc to become 14th oneworld member\" />\n\n==Corporate affairs==\n===Ownership and subsidiaries===\n[[File:Atlas Blue Boeing 737-400 CN-RND BRU 2009-7-31.png|thumb|A [[Boeing 737-400]] wearing a combined Royal Air Maroc/Atlas Blue [[Aircraft livery|livery]] in 2009.

Meanwhile, newer, more efficient, Classic 400 and 500 Series Boeing 737s were introduced to increase the frequency of European routes. By the middle of the decade all 727s had disappeared. To consolidate its North American operations, Royal Air Maroc purchased a single [[Boeing 747-400]]. As the decade progressed, new routes to previously under-served African airports were opened.\n\n=== 2000-present ===\nWith the increasing number of passengers and newly opened routes as well as increasing oil prices, there was a need to buy new aircraft. In 2000 an order for 20 Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft and 4 [[Airbus A321]]s was placed. Meanwhile, more routes to west and central African cities were opened.\nRAM was now changing, from providing flights to meet the demands of foreign tourists and Moroccan expatriates, to providing connections between European cities and African cities via the Casablanca hub. In 2002, the company leased two 767s to replace the single 747 in North American routes.\n\nMorocco and the EU signed an [[open skies]] agreement in late 2006.
