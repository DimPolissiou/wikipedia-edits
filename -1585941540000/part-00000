Until 1920 the [[established church]] was the [[Church of England]], but from 1920 the disestablished [[Church in Wales]], still [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], was self-governing. [[Wales]] also has a strong tradition of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]], including [[Methodism]].\n\nMost adherents to organised [[religion]] in Wales follow [[Catholicism]] or other [[Christian denomination]]s such as the [[Church in Wales]], [[Presbyterian Church of Wales]], [[Baptist Union of Wales|Baptist]] and [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist]] churches, and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Other religions Welsh people may be affiliated with include [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Neodruidism|Druidism]], with most non-Christian Welsh people found in the large cities of [[Cardiff]] and [[Swansea]].\n\n==Census statistics==\n<div style=\"display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; flex-direction:row; align-items:center;\">\n<div style=\"margin-right:10px;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Religion\n!colspan=\"2\"|2001<ref name=\"stats\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Religion (2001 Census) |url=http://data.gov.uk/dataset/religion_2001_census |publisher=[[data.gov.uk]] |accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>\n!colspan=\"2\"|2011<ref name=\"stats\">{{cite web|title=2011 Census: Key Statistics for Wales, March 2011|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-unitary-authorities-in-wales/stb-2011-census-key-statistics-for-wales.html#tab---Religion|publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]]|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=ks2011>{{cite web |title=2011 Census: KS209EW Religion, local authorities in England and Wales |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262 |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n!Number\n!%\n!Number\n!%\n|-\n|style=\"background:#E0F0FF;\"|[[Christianity in Wales|Christianity]]||align=right|2,087,242||align=right|71.9||align=right|1,763,299||align=right|57.6\n|-\n|style=\"background:#E0FFD0;\"|[[Islam in Wales|Islam]]||align=right|21,739||align=right|0.7||align=right|45,950||align=right|1.5\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FFE0C0;\"|[[Hinduism in Wales|Hinduism]]||align=right|5,439||align=right|0.2||align=right|10,434||align=right|0.3\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FFFFC0;\"|[[Buddhism in Wales|Buddhism]]||align=right|5,407||align=right|0.2||align=right|9,117||align=right|0.3\n|-\n|style=\"background:#F0F0C0;\"|[[Sikhism in Wales|Sikhism]]||align=right|2,015||align=right|0.1||align=right|2,962||align=right|0.1\n|-\n|style=\"background:#E0E0FF;\"|[[History of the Jews in Wales|Judaism]]||align=right|2,256||align=right|0.1||align=right|2,064||align=right|0.1\n|-\n|style=\"background:#F0E0F0;\"|Other religion||align=right|6,909||align=right|0.2||align=right|12,705||align=right|0.4\n|-\n|style=\"background:#F5F5F5;\"|[[Irreligion in the United Kingdom|No religion]]||align=right|537,935||align=right|18.5||align=right|982,997||align=right|32.1\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|Religion not stated||align=right|234,143||align=right|8.1||align=right|233,928||align=right|7.6\n|-\n|Total population||align=right|2,903,085||align=right|100.0||align=right|3,063,456||align=right|100.0\n|}\n</div><div>\n{{Graph:Chart\n| width = 300\n| xAxisTitle = Census\n| xAxisAngle = -40\n| xType = date\n| x = 2001, 2011\n| yAxisMax = 1\n| yAxisFormat = %\n| yGrid = \n| yAxisTitle = % claiming affiliation\n| colors = dodgerblue, green, red, black\n| y1 = .719, .576\n| y2 = .015, .027\n| y3 = .185, .321\n| y4 = .081, .076\n| showSymbols = \n}}\n{{legend|DodgerBlue|Christianity}}\n{{legend|Green|Other}}\n{{legend|Red|No religion}}\n{{legend|Black|Not stated}}\n</div></div>\n\n==Christianity==\n{{Denominations of the United Kingdom}}\n{{Main|Christianity in Wales}}\n\n===History===\n\n====Roman origins====\nAlthough Christianity arrived in [[Roman Wales|Wales]] sometime in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation, it was initially suppressed. The first Christian [[martyr]]s in Wales, [[Julius and Aaron]], were killed around AD 304. The earliest Christian object found in Wales is a vessel with a [[Chi-Rho|Chi-Rho symbol]] found at [[Caerwent]]. Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century.<ref name=bbcsaints>\n{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/religion/sites/timeline/pages/religion_in_wales_3.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] Wales |title=The Age of the Saints }}</ref> After the [[Roman legion]]s withdrew in the 5th century [[Anglo-Saxon]] invaders gradually conquered eastern and southern Britain but were unable to make inroads into Wales, cutting off Wales from the Celts in [[Scotland]], [[Cornwall]] and [[Cumbria]]. The writer [[Gildas]] drew sharp contrasts between the Christian Welsh at this time and the pagan Anglo-Saxon invaders.\n\n====Emergence====\n[[File:Eglwys-y-Grog, Mwnt, Pembrokeshire.jpg|thumb|Eglwys-y-Grog, a 13th-century church in [[Mwnt]], [[Ceredigion]]]]\nThe ''age of the saints'' (about AD 500\u2013700) was marked by the establishment of monastic settlements throughout the country, by religious leaders such as [[Saint David]], [[Illtud]] and [[Teilo]]. This was the period when the [[Welsh people|Welsh]] developed a shared national identity, arising from their [[Welsh language|language]] and religious beliefs.<ref name=bbcsaints/><ref>{{cite book |last=Lloyd |first=J.E. |authorlink=John Edward Lloyd |year=1911 |title=A History of Wales from the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest |location=London |publisher=[[Longman|Longman, Green, & Co]] |volume=1 |pages=143\u2013159}}</ref>\n\nThe Welsh bishops refused to co-operate with [[Augustine of Canterbury]]'s mission to the Anglo-Saxons. However, a combination of [[Celtic Christianity]]'s reconciliation with Rome and English conquest of Wales meant that from the [[Middle Ages]] until 1920, the Welsh dioceses were part of the established [[Church of England]] in its [[Province of Canterbury]]. They were all in communion with Rome until the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] made them independent of Rome and under the control of King [[Henry VIII]].  The [[Established Church]] in Wales was the Church of England until it was disestablished in Wales in 1920. The old Welsh dioceses became the new [[Church in Wales]]. It created a new diocese in 1921, the [[Diocese of Monmouth]].\n\n====Reformation====\nBishop [[Richard Davies (bishop)|Richard Davies]] and dissident Protestant cleric [[John Penry]] introduced Calvinist theology to Wales. They used the model of the [[Synod of Dort]] of 1618\u20131619. Calvinism developed through the Puritan period, following the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, and within Wales' Methodist movement. However, few copies of Calvin's writings were available in Welsh before the mid 19th century.<ref>D. Densil Morgan, \"Calvinism in Wales: c.1590-1909,\" ''Welsh Journal of Religious History'' (2009), Vol. 4, p22-36</ref>\n\n====Welsh as liturgical language====\nSome books of the [[Bible]] and of the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] had been translated in the Middle Ages, but the [[Acts of Union 1536-1543|Acts of Union]] (1536\u201343) passed under [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] effectively banned the [[Welsh language]] from official use. However, under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] the English Parliament passed the [[An Act for the Translating of the Bible and the Divine Service into the Welsh Tongue 1563]]. In 1567 [[William Salesbury]], [[Richard Davies (bishop)|Richard Davies]] and [[Thomas Huet]] completed the first modern translation of the New Testament into Welsh and the first translation of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] ({{lang-cy|Y Llyfr Gweddi Gyffredin}}). Then in 1588 [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]] completed a translation of the whole Bible. These translations were essential to the survival of the Welsh language and had the effect of conferring status on Welsh as a [[liturgical language]] and vehicle for worship. This had a significant role in its continued use as a means of everyday communication and as a literary language down to the present day despite the pressure of English.\n\nAbuses did occur, and in the 18th century some bishops granted [[Benefice#Church of England|benefices]] in Welsh-speaking areas to English clergy who did not speak Welsh.<ref name=PCW>{{cite book |author=[[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion#The first Society, 1751\u201387|The Cymmrodorion]] |year=1773 |title=The Depositions, Arguments and Judgement in the Cause of the Church-Wardens of Trefdraeth, In the County of Anglesea, against Dr. Bowles; adjudged by the Worshipful G.

The established Church of England recovered slowly from the widespread damage brought about by the English Civil War, and the Puritan Commonwealth of Cromwell, in the mid-17th century. Poverty was widespread in the overwhelmingly rural country. The clergy were impoverished and subsisted on their own farm work on their glebes. Facilities from personages to graveyards to churches to cathedrals were commonly in physical disrepair. Membership and participation was falling.<ref>Alfred George Edwards, ''Landmarks in the History of the Welsh Church'' (1912) pp. 161ff</ref>\n\n====Nonconformity, membership and revivals====\n{{Main|Nonconformity in Wales}}\n[[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformity]] grew rapidly and came to dominate the religious life of Wales from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. The [[Welsh Methodist revival]] of the 18th century was one of the most significant religious and social movements in the history of Wales. The revival began within the Church of England in Wales and at the beginning remained as a group within it, but the Welsh revival differed from the Methodist revival in England in that its theology was [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] rather than [[Arminianism|Arminian]]. Welsh Methodists gradually built up their own networks, structures, and even meeting houses (or chapels), which led eventually to the secession of 1811 and the formal establishment of the Calvinistic Methodist [[Presbyterian church of Wales]] in 1823. Emotionalism had free rein; in contrast to Scotland with its four universities, good schools, and a strong theological tradition, Wales had no universities and widespread illiteracy.\n\nThe Welsh Methodist revival also had an influence on the older [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] churches, or [[dissenter]]s \u2013 the [[Baptists]] and the [[Congregationalist church|Congregationalists]] \u2013 who in turn also experienced growth and renewal. As a result, by the middle of the nineteenth century, Wales was predominantly a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] country.\n\nStatistics of membership between 1680 and 1840 demonstrate that the established Church of England lost one-fifth of its membership. In addition, an ever-increasing number of nominal Anglicans also ceasing to practise. Nonconformity more than quadrupled, mainly from 1760 and especially after 1800. In 1800 there were twice as many Anglican churches as Nonconformist chapels; in 1850, chapels outnumbered churches by a ratio of 5 to 2. Roman Catholicism kept pace with demographic growth, but, even reinforced by Irish immigration, remained a limited force in 1840. Judaism and overt irreligion were both rare.<ref>Clive D. Field, \"Counting Religion in England and Wales: The Long Eighteenth Century, c. 1680\u2013c. 1840.\" ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' 63#4 (2012): 693-720.</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the nonconformist bodies numbered 550,000 members, as against 193,000 in the established Church of England. Nonconformists, led by Liberal [[David Lloyd George]], increasingly controlled the politics of Wales, although the elite sectors were still dominated by the Anglicans.<ref>{{cite book|author=A. N.

At least 100,000 people became Christians during the 1904\u20131905 revival.<ref>E. Cynolwyn Pugh, \"The Welsh Revival of 1904\u20131905.\" ''Theology Today'' 12.2 (1955): 226-235.</ref> Even so, it did not put a stop to the gradual decline of Christianity in Wales, only holding it back slightly.<ref>Clive D.

The reasons for this are unclear.<ref>2011 Census Religion tables for Urban Areas.</ref>\n\n====Disestablishment - creation of the Church in Wales ====\nIn reaction to the rise of nonconformity, some Anglicans came to recognise the weaknesses of the established church and its failure to counteract the popular aspects of nonconformity. The rigidity of the parish system and the distance between churches were quoted as examples of the failure of the church to adapt.<ref name=\"W 3-3-65 church\">{{cite news |title=Welsh Church Improvement |url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4352963/4352969/31 |accessdate=15 December 2018 |newspaper=Welshman |date=3 March 1865 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Welsh Church Act 1914]] provided for the separation of the four dioceses of the [[Church of England]] located in Wales (known collectively as the [[Church in Wales]]) from the rest of the Church, and for the simultaneous [[disestablishment]] of the Church. The Act came into operation in 1920. Since then there has been no [[established church]] in Wales.

The bishops of these dioceses are part of the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales]]. In total, the three dioceses counted 209,451 Catholics on a population of 3,112,451 inhabitants, equalling to a percentage of 6,7% Catholics. The three dioceses have 172 priests and 34 permanent deacons, 75 male religious and 267 female religious, and a total of 154 parishes as of 2016 (2017 for the diocese of Wrexham).<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dcard.html]</ref> However, the province is not completely equal to Wales, as the Archdiocese of Cardiff also covers [[Herefordshire]], in [[England]].\n\n===Sabbatarianism===\nThe [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbatarian]] [[temperance movement]] was strong among the Welsh in the Victorian period and the early twentieth century, the sale of alcohol being prohibited on Sundays in Wales by the ''[[Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881|Sunday Closing Act]]'' of 1881 \u2013 the first legislation specifically issued for Wales since the Middle Ages. From the early 1960s, local council areas were permitted to hold [[referendum]]s every seven years to determine whether they should be ''wet'' or ''dry'' on Sundays: most of the industrialised areas in the east and south went ''wet'' immediately, and by the 1980s, [[Dwyfor]] in the northwest as the last of the dry regions went wet after a local referendum in 1982; however, in the next referendum it returned to a dry region on Sundays from 1989 to 1996.\nIn early 1996 reconstruction of Gwynedd resulted in Dwyfor district being abolished and Dwyfor area is now covered by an area committee of the Gwynedd Council and there have been no further \"Wet - Dry\" referendums.\n\n===Saints===\n[[File:Cathedral St Davids South Wales.jpg|thumb|A monastic community was founded by Saint David at what is now [[St David's]].

Since that time the Jewish population of that area, which reached a peak of 4,000\u20135,000 in 1913, has declined.

[[Wales]] also has a strong tradition of [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformism]], including [[Methodism]].\n\nMost adherents to organised [[religion]] in Wales follow [[Catholicism]] or other [[Christian denomination]]s such as the [[Church in Wales]], [[Presbyterian Church of Wales]], [[Baptist Union of Wales|Baptist]] and [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist]] churches, and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Other religions Welsh people may be affiliated with include [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Islam]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Neodruidism|Druidism]], with most non-Christian Welsh people found in the large cities of [[Cardiff]] and [[Swansea]].\n\n==Census statistics==\n<div style=\"display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; flex-direction:row; align-items:center;\">\n<div style=\"margin-right:10px;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Religion\n!colspan=\"2\"|2001<ref name=\"stats\"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Religion (2001 Census) |url=http://data.gov.uk/dataset/religion_2001_census |publisher=[[data.gov.uk]] |accessdate=17 December 2012}}</ref>\n!colspan=\"2\"|2011<ref name=\"stats\">{{cite web|title=2011 Census: Key Statistics for Wales, March 2011|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/key-statistics-for-unitary-authorities-in-wales/stb-2011-census-key-statistics-for-wales.html#tab---Religion|publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]]|accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=ks2011>{{cite web |title=2011 Census: KS209EW Religion, local authorities in England and Wales |url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286262 |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=15 December 2012}}</ref>\n|-\n!Number\n!%\n!Number\n!%\n|-\n|style=\"background:#E0F0FF;\"|[[Christianity in Wales|Christianity]]||align=right|2,087,242||align=right|71.9||align=right|1,763,299||align=right|57.6\n|-\n|style=\"background:#E0FFD0;\"|[[Islam in Wales|Islam]]||align=right|21,739||align=right|0.7||align=right|45,950||align=right|1.5\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FFE0C0;\"|[[Hinduism in Wales|Hinduism]]||align=right|5,439||align=right|0.2||align=right|10,434||align=right|0.3\n|-\n|style=\"background:#FFFFC0;\"|[[Buddhism in Wales|Buddhism]]||align=right|5,407||align=right|0.2||align=right|9,117||align=right|0.3\n|-\n|style=\"background:#F0F0C0;\"|[[Sikhism in Wales|Sikhism]]||align=right|2,015||align=right|0.1||align=right|2,962||align=right|0.1\n|-\n|style=\"background:#E0E0FF;\"|[[History of the Jews in Wales|Judaism]]||align=right|2,256||align=right|0.1||align=right|2,064||align=right|0.1\n|-\n|style=\"background:#F0E0F0;\"|Other religion||align=right|6,909||align=right|0.2||align=right|12,705||align=right|0.4\n|-\n|style=\"background:#F5F5F5;\"|[[Irreligion in the United Kingdom|No religion]]||align=right|537,935||align=right|18.5||align=right|982,997||align=right|32.1\n|-\n|style=\"background:#DCDCDC;\"|Religion not stated||align=right|234,143||align=right|8.1||align=right|233,928||align=right|7.6\n|-\n|Total population||align=right|2,903,085||align=right|100.0||align=right|3,063,456||align=right|100.0\n|}\n</div><div>\n{{Graph:Chart\n| width = 300\n| xAxisTitle = Census\n| xAxisAngle = -40\n| xType = date\n| x = 2001, 2011\n| yAxisMax = 1\n| yAxisFormat = %\n| yGrid = \n| yAxisTitle = % claiming affiliation\n| colors = dodgerblue, green, red, black\n| y1 = .719, .576\n| y2 = .015, .027\n| y3 = .185, .321\n| y4 = .081, .076\n| showSymbols = \n}}\n{{legend|DodgerBlue|Christianity}}\n{{legend|Green|Other}}\n{{legend|Red|No religion}}\n{{legend|Black|Not stated}}\n</div></div>\n\n==Christianity==\n{{Denominations of the United Kingdom}}\n{{Main|Christianity in Wales}}\n\n===History===\n\n====Roman origins====\nAlthough Christianity arrived in [[Roman Wales|Wales]] sometime in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] occupation, it was initially suppressed. The first Christian [[martyr]]s in Wales, [[Julius and Aaron]], were killed around AD 304. The earliest Christian object found in Wales is a vessel with a [[Chi-Rho|Chi-Rho symbol]] found at [[Caerwent]]. Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire in the 4th century.<ref name=bbcsaints>\n{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/religion/sites/timeline/pages/religion_in_wales_3.shtml |publisher=[[BBC]] Wales |title=The Age of the Saints }}</ref> After the [[Roman legion]]s withdrew in the 5th century [[Anglo-Saxon]] invaders gradually conquered eastern and southern Britain but were unable to make inroads into Wales, cutting off Wales from the Celts in [[Scotland]], [[Cornwall]] and [[Cumbria]].

However, a combination of [[Celtic Christianity]]'s reconciliation with Rome and English conquest of Wales meant that from the [[Middle Ages]] until 1920, the Welsh dioceses were part of the established [[Church of England]] in its [[Province of Canterbury]]. They were all in communion with Rome until the [[English Reformation|Reformation]] made them independent of Rome and under the control of King [[Henry VIII]].  The [[Established Church]] in Wales was the Church of England until it was disestablished in Wales in 1920. The old Welsh dioceses became the new [[Church in Wales]]. It created a new diocese in 1921, the [[Diocese of Monmouth]].\n\n====Reformation====\nBishop [[Richard Davies (bishop)|Richard Davies]] and dissident Protestant cleric [[John Penry]] introduced Calvinist theology to Wales. They used the model of the [[Synod of Dort]] of 1618\u20131619. Calvinism developed through the Puritan period, following the restoration of the monarchy under Charles II, and within Wales' Methodist movement. However, few copies of Calvin's writings were available in Welsh before the mid 19th century.<ref>D. Densil Morgan, \"Calvinism in Wales: c.1590-1909,\" ''Welsh Journal of Religious History'' (2009), Vol. 4, p22-36</ref>\n\n====Welsh as liturgical language====\nSome books of the [[Bible]] and of the [[Biblical apocrypha|Apocrypha]] had been translated in the Middle Ages, but the [[Acts of Union 1536-1543|Acts of Union]] (1536\u201343) passed under [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] effectively banned the [[Welsh language]] from official use. However, under [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] the English Parliament passed the [[An Act for the Translating of the Bible and the Divine Service into the Welsh Tongue 1563]]. In 1567 [[William Salesbury]], [[Richard Davies (bishop)|Richard Davies]] and [[Thomas Huet]] completed the first modern translation of the New Testament into Welsh and the first translation of the [[Book of Common Prayer]] ({{lang-cy|Y Llyfr Gweddi Gyffredin}}). Then in 1588 [[William Morgan (Bible translator)|William Morgan]] completed a translation of the whole Bible. These translations were essential to the survival of the Welsh language and had the effect of conferring status on Welsh as a [[liturgical language]] and vehicle for worship. This had a significant role in its continued use as a means of everyday communication and as a literary language down to the present day despite the pressure of English.\n\nAbuses did occur, and in the 18th century some bishops granted [[Benefice#Church of England|benefices]] in Welsh-speaking areas to English clergy who did not speak Welsh.<ref name=PCW>{{cite book |author=[[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion#The first Society, 1751\u201387|The Cymmrodorion]] |year=1773 |title=The Depositions, Arguments and Judgement in the Cause of the Church-Wardens of Trefdraeth, In the County of Anglesea, against Dr. Bowles; adjudged by the Worshipful G.

The established Church of England recovered slowly from the widespread damage brought about by the English Civil War, and the Puritan Commonwealth of Cromwell, in the mid-17th century. Poverty was widespread in the overwhelmingly rural country. The clergy were impoverished and subsisted on their own farm work on their glebes. Facilities from personages to graveyards to churches to cathedrals were commonly in physical disrepair. Membership and participation was falling.<ref>Alfred George Edwards, ''Landmarks in the History of the Welsh Church'' (1912) pp. 161ff</ref>\n\n====Nonconformity, membership and revivals====\n{{Main|Nonconformity in Wales}}\n[[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformity]] grew rapidly and came to dominate the religious life of Wales from the eighteenth to the twentieth centuries. The [[Welsh Methodist revival]] of the 18th century was one of the most significant religious and social movements in the history of Wales. The revival began within the Church of England in Wales and at the beginning remained as a group within it, but the Welsh revival differed from the Methodist revival in England in that its theology was [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] rather than [[Arminianism|Arminian]]. Welsh Methodists gradually built up their own networks, structures, and even meeting houses (or chapels), which led eventually to the secession of 1811 and the formal establishment of the Calvinistic Methodist [[Presbyterian church of Wales]] in 1823. Emotionalism had free rein, in contrast to Scotland with its four universities, good schools, and a strong theological tradition, Wales had no universities and widespread illiteracy.\n\nThe Welsh Methodist revival also had an influence on the older [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] churches, or [[dissenter]]s \u2013 the [[Baptists]] and the [[Congregationalist church|Congregationalists]] \u2013 who in turn also experienced growth and renewal. As a result, by the middle of the nineteenth century, Wales was predominantly a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] country.\n\nStatistics of membership between 1680 and 1840 demonstrate that the established Church of England lost one-fifth of its membership. In addition, an ever-increasing number of nominal Anglicans also ceasing to practise. Nonconformity more than quadrupled, mainly from 1760 and especially after 1800. In 1800 there were twice as many Anglican churches as Nonconformist chapels; in 1850, chapels outnumbered churches by a ratio of 5 to 2. Roman Catholicism kept pace with demographic growth, but, even reinforced by Irish immigration, remained a limited force in 1840. Judaism and overt irreligion were both rare.<ref>Clive D. Field, \"Counting Religion in England and Wales: The Long Eighteenth Century, c. 1680\u2013c. 1840.\" ''Journal of Ecclesiastical History'' 63#4 (2012): 693-720.</ref>\n\nIn 1910, the nonconformist bodies numbered 550,000 members, as against 193,000 in the established Church of England. Nonconformists, led by Liberal [[David Lloyd George]], increasingly controlled the politics of Wales, although the elite sectors were still dominated by the Anglicans.<ref>{{cite book|author=A. N.

At least 100,000 people became Christians during the 1904\u20131905 revival.<ref>E. Cynolwyn Pugh, \"The Welsh Revival of 1904\u20131905.\" ''Theology Today'' 12.2 (1955): 226-235.</ref> Even so, it did not put a stop to the gradual decline of Christianity in Wales, only holding it back slightly.<ref>Clive D.

The reasons for this are unclear.<ref>2011 Census Religion tables for Urban Areas.</ref>\n\n====Disestablishment - creation of the Church in Wales ====\nIn reaction to the rise of nonconformity, some Anglicans came to recognise the weaknesses of the established church and its failure to counteract the popular aspects of nonconformity. The rigidity of the parish system and the distance between churches were quoted as examples of the failure of the church to adapt.<ref name=\"W 3-3-65 church\">{{cite news |title=Welsh Church Improvement |url=https://newspapers.library.wales/view/4352963/4352969/31 |accessdate=15 December 2018 |newspaper=Welshman |date=3 March 1865 |page=6}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Welsh Church Act 1914]] provided for the separation of the four dioceses of the [[Church of England]] located in Wales (known collectively as the [[Church in Wales]]) from the rest of the Church, and for the simultaneous [[disestablishment]] of the Church. The Act came into operation in 1920. Since then there has been no [[established church]] in Wales. Between 1996 and 2016 the number of signed-up Church in Wales members dropped from 91,247 to 45,759 <ref>[https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/church-wales-spend-10m-breathe-14681635 Church in Wales ]</ref> or 1,5% out of a total population of 3,113,150 <ref>[https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Population-and-Migration/Population/Estimates/nationallevelpopulationestimates-by-year-age-ukcountry Statistics Wales National level population estimates by year ]</ref> The number of signed-up Church in Wales members dropped further to 42,441 by 2018 <ref>[https://s3.amazonaws.com/cinw/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Membership-Finance-2019.pdf Church in Wales Membership & Finance 2018]</ref> or 1,4% out of the total Welsh population of 1,187,203<ref>[https://www.ukpopulation.org/wales-population/ UK population Wales]</ref>\n\n===Present-day Roman Catholicism===\nCatholics are served by the Ecclesiastical Province of Cardiff, which exists out of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cardiff|Archdiocese of Cardiff]], the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Menevia|Diocese of Menevia]] and the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Wrexham|Diocese of Wrexham]]. The bishops of these dioceses are part of the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of England and Wales]]. In total, the three dioceses counted 209,451 Catholics on a population of 3,112,451 inhabitants, equalling to a percentage of 6,7% Catholics. The three dioceses have 172 priests and 34 permanent deacons, 75 male religious and 267 female religious, and a total of 154 parishes as of 2016 (2017 for the diocese of Wrexham).<ref>[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/dcard.html]</ref> However, the province is not completely equal to Wales, as the Archdiocese of Cardiff also covers [[Herefordshire]], in [[England]].\n\n===Sabbatarianism===\nThe [[Sabbath in Christianity|Sabbatarian]] [[temperance movement]] was strong among the Welsh in the Victorian period and the early twentieth century, the sale of alcohol being prohibited on Sundays in Wales by the ''[[Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881|Sunday Closing Act]]'' of 1881 \u2013 the first legislation specifically issued for Wales since the Middle Ages. From the early 1960s, local council areas were permitted to hold [[referendum]]s every seven years to determine whether they should be ''wet'' or ''dry'' on Sundays: most of the industrialised areas in the east and south went ''wet'' immediately, and by the 1980s, [[Dwyfor]] in the northwest as the last of the dry regions went wet after a local referendum in 1982; however, in the next referendum it returned to a dry region on Sundays from 1989 to 1996.\nIn early 1996 reconstruction of Gwynedd resulted in Dwyfor district being abolished and Dwyfor area is now covered by an area committee of the Gwynedd Council and there have been no further \"Wet - Dry\" referendums.\n\n===Saints===\n[[File:Cathedral St Davids South Wales.jpg|thumb|A monastic community was founded by Saint David at what is now [[St David's]].

Since that time the Jewish population of that area, which reached a peak of 4,000\u20135,000 in 1913, has declined.

One of the jurors, Mary Jacob, said that both she and a fellow juror, a 20-year-old student at [[Xavier University of Louisiana]], were verbally abused by fellow jurors for their decision to acquit. According to Jacob, the abuse resulted in her switching her verdict, saying \"They literally made this 20-year-old girl so violently ill, she was shaking so bad. She ran into the bathroom. She was throwing her guts up. She couldn't function anymore. That's when I decided, the judge don't want to listen to me, doesn't want to listen to us? I told them, 'You want him to be guilty? He's guilty; now let's get the hell out of here.{{'\"}} This account was partially confirmed by another juror.
