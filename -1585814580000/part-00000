Illinois|Lake County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]]. The population was 14,462 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US1743770| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Lindenhurst village, Illinois| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=December 17, 2012}}</ref> Lindenhurst lies within [[Lake Villa Township, Lake County, Illinois|Lake Villa Township]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2007}}\nThe Village of Lindenhurst lies within the [[Valparaiso Moraine|Valparaiso moraine]] from the most recent Ice Age. The area is rich in lakes and swamp land; it was inhabited by the [[Potawatomi|Potawatomi Indian tribe]], who mixed agriculture with hunting and fishing. The rich soil ultimately attracted European farmers. An expedition led by [[Colbee Benton]] in the 1830s was followed by treaties by which the Potawatomi, the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and the Blackhawk Tribes agreed to leave the area. Most Euro-American settlers came from the east coast, the first recorded being the Pennsylvanian Noer Potter. There were also a number of early Scottish, German and English arrivals.<ref>Brysiewicz, Joseph E. Lindenhurst : first fifty years. iUniverse : New York, 2008. pp 1 -3</ref>\n\nIncorporation papers for Lindenhurst were filed in November 1956 with Lake County Judge Minard Hulse. The first village officials were elected in a December 1956 election, with 90% voter turnout. The village was incorporated on January 16, 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.city-data.com/city/Lindenhurst-Illinois.html|title= Lindenhurst, Illinois |publisher= City-Data.com|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first village president was Lee R. Lewis, and meetings were held on Saturdays to accommodate the commuting members of the board and community. The first meeting was held in the home of trustee Helen Skelton. Another election \u2013 mandated by law \u2013 was held in April 1957, and Robert Randall was elected the new president. The board held fundraisers like dances to purchase such things as stationery and record books. After his first year in office, President Randall reflected on the successes: ordinances and zoning laws had been passed, roads were being graded, snow removed, and police were patrolling the village. Running water from a tower near Fairfield Road and Hawthorne Drive arrived in the late 1950s.\n\nThe village population was now 1,000.\n\n== Incorporation ==\n\n=== Housing ===\nThe village of Lindenhurst grew out of the farm of a wealthy landowner in northern Illinois. The [[Ernst E. Lehmann]] farm, known as Lindenhurst, was acquired by developer Morton \"Mort\" Engle, who bought it from Lehmann family friend Edna Siebel. The name Lindenhurst came from the two rows of [[tilia americana|linden]] trees outlining the original farmhouse. Engle subdivided the {{convert|600|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm in 1952, and in 1953, the first homes were built behind what is now Linden Plaza. Engle Homes at the time cost $12,000\u2013$15,000, roof extra. \"The idyllic family homes of Lindenhurst offered the perfect solution for a home-hungry nation,\" states local historian Joseph Brysiewicz.  In 1961, Ted Flanagan was elected mayor, and 200 houses were being built each year, under the control of Engle.  After building an estimated 2,000 homes, Mort Engle sold his remaining {{convert|250|acre|km2}} to the U.S. Home Corporation and {{convert|200|acre|km2}} to the Federal Life Insurance Company and moved to [[Arizona]]. {{convert|550|acre|km2}} were annexed into the village, and the growth of Lindenhurst brought up school and public safety issues.\n\n=== Education ===\nThe first school was completed in September 1958. Built on land from the Howard Bonner farm and redistricted from the Millburn school district to Lake Villa District 41, the school was named B.J. Hooper School after District 41 school board president and prominent Lake Villa citizen B.J. Hooper.\n\n=== Business Development ===\nLindenhurst's first business, Thor's Shell, stood at the intersection of Grand Avenue and Lindenhurst Drive. By 1960, the first major commercial development in Lindenhurst was the building of Linden Plaza, featuring Slove Bakery, Village Laundry, Linden Cleaners, and [[Piggly Wiggly]]. Other businesses established in Lindenhurst included Linden [[Texaco]], Linden Barber Shop, [[Ben Franklin Stores|Ben Franklin Variety Store]], and Stretch-A-Dollar Clothing Store. The Lindenhurst Civic Center built its own facility in 1961 using the remains of the original Lindenhurst Farm ice house to anchor its building. It served as a meeting place for groups and organizations, card parties, socials, polling place, wedding receptions and family reunions. A school for the old Lindenhurst farm served as [[Village hall|Village Hall]] until it burned down, and the offices moved to Linden Plaza. By 1970, the village numbered 3,141 people. The village offices couldn't be crammed into Linden Plaza any longer, and the new village hall that was built in 1974 housed office space, the mayor, the police department, the building inspector, and the village garage.\n\n=== Public Safety ===\nThe Lindenhurst police force was all-volunteer at first, buying their own uniforms and using their own cars; fundraisers were held to pay for salaries and a patrol car. A full-time police position was created in 1963, and the village acquired a reputation as a \"[[speed trap]]\", due to radar use by the police. Lindenhurst became front-page headline material on November 27, 2006, when the village's first [[homicide]] in over nine years took place. A [[Burger King]] manager was killed in an apparent robbery at the national fast-food chain's Lindenhurst franchise.\n\nIn  1965, the village created its first sanitary district, replacing individual [[septic system]]s with a [[sanitary sewer|sewer system]]. Streets were paved and gutters installed during this period as well. Ted Flanagan was reelected mayor in 1969 and served until 1983.\n\n=== Community ===\nBesides the village's 25th anniversary, the 1980s brought the village, [[cable TV]] access, [[fast food]], and a budget of $1.5 million. Lindenfest was founded by volunteers in 1983. It grew out of tents and booths set up by local clubs and organizations in the village hall parking lot. Today it has a [[carnival]], games, contests, marathons, and music. Other additions to Lindenhurst in recent years include Victory Lakes, the Lindenhurst-Lake Villa Chamber of Commerce, and the Lindenhurst Park District.\n\nThe population in 1990 was 8,044 and is over 14,000 today. In a 1999 ''Lake Villa and Lindenhurst Review'' article, Village Administrator James Stevens said that Lindenhurst \"has been able to keep the small town flavor, in large part, through selective land annexation, and by carefully choosing developers for high quality but diversified housing types, including single family, town homes and condominiums. And all the housing types have to be integrated with the lakes, marshes, open space and forested areas of the village.\" The Lindenhurst motto is \"Developing Today for Tomorrow\".\n\n==Geography==\nLindenhurst is located at {{coord|42|24|37|N|88|1|34|W|type:city}} (42.41053, -88.02624).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Lindenhurst has a total area of {{convert|4.774|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|4.44|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 93%) is land and {{convert|0.334|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 7%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1743770\n  |title=G001 \u2013 Geographic Identifiers \u2013 2010 Census Summary File 1\n  |accessdate=2015-08-04\n  |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]\n  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213064756/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1743770\n  |archive-date=2020-02-13\n  |url-status=dead\n  }}</ref>\n\nLindenhurst's first stop light was erected at Grand Avenue and Sand Lake Road in the 1980s.\n\n===Major streets===\n* [[File:US 45.svg|20px]]\n* [[File:Illinois 132.svg|20px]] Grand Avenue\n* Grass Lake Road\n* Savage Road\n* Gelden Road\n* Deep Lake Road\n* Granada Boulevard\n* Sand Lake Road\n* Beck Road\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1960= 1259\n|1970= 3141\n|1980= 6220\n|1990= 8038\n|2000= 12539\n|2010= 14462\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=14328\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 3, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 14,462 people residing in the village.

The population was 14,462 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US1743770| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): Lindenhurst village, Illinois| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=December 17, 2012}}</ref> Lindenhurst lies within [[Lake Villa Township, Lake County, Illinois|Lake Villa Township]].\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2007}}\nThe Village of Lindenhurst lies within the [[Valparaiso Moraine|Valparaiso moraine]] from the most recent Ice Age. The area is rich in lakes and swamp land; it was inhabited by the [[Potawatomi|Potawatomi Indian tribe]], who mixed agriculture with hunting and fishing. The rich soil ultimately attracted European farmers. An expedition led by [[Colbee Benton]] in the 1830s was followed by treaties by which the Potawatomi, the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] and the Blackhawk Tribes agreed to leave the area. Most Euro-American settlers came from the east coast, the first recorded being the Pennsylvanian Noer Potter. There were also a number of early Scottish, German and English arrivals.<ref>Brysiewicz, Joseph E. Lindenhurst : first fifty years. iUniverse : New York, 2008. pp 1 -3</ref>\n\nIncorporation papers for Lindenhurst were filed in November 1956 with Lake County Judge Minard Hulse. The first village officials were elected in a December 1956 election, with 90% voter turnout. The village was incorporated on January 16, 1957.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.city-data.com/city/Lindenhurst-Illinois.html|title= Lindenhurst, Illinois |publisher= City-Data.com|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe first village president was Lee R. Lewis, and meetings were held on Saturdays to accommodate the commuting members of the board and community. The first meeting was held in the home of trustee Helen Skelton. Another election \u2013 mandated by law \u2013 was held in April 1957, and Robert Randall was elected the new president. The board held fundraisers like dances to purchase such things as stationery and record books. After his first year in office, President Randall reflected on the successes: ordinances and zoning laws had been passed, roads were being graded, snow removed, and police were patrolling the village. Running water from a tower near Fairfield Road and Hawthorne Drive arrived in the late 1950s.\n\nThe village population was now 1,000.\n\n== Incorporation ==\n\n=== Housing ===\nThe village of Lindenhurst grew out of the farm of a wealthy landowner in northern Illinois. The [[Ernst E. Lehmann]] farm, known as Lindenhurst, was acquired by developer Morton \"Mort\" Engle, who bought it from Lehmann family friend Edna Siebel. The name Lindenhurst came from the two rows of [[tilia americana|linden]] trees outlining the original farmhouse. Engle subdivided the {{convert|600|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm in 1952, and in 1953, the first homes were built behind what is now Linden Plaza. Engle Homes at the time cost $12,000\u2013$15,000, roof extra. \"The idyllic family homes of Lindenhurst offered the perfect solution for a home-hungry nation,\" states local historian Joseph Brysiewicz.  In 1961, Ted Flanagan was elected mayor, and 200 houses were being built each year, under the control of Engle.  After building an estimated 2,000 homes, Mort Engle sold his remaining {{convert|250|acre|km2}} to the U.S. Home Corporation and {{convert|200|acre|km2}} to the Federal Life Insurance Company and moved to [[Arizona]]. {{convert|550|acre|km2}} were annexed into the village, and the growth of Lindenhurst brought up school and public safety issues.\n\n=== Education ===\nThe first school was completed in September 1958. Built on land from the Howard Bonner farm and redistricted from the Millburn school district to Lake Villa District 41, the school was named B.J. Hooper School after District 41 school board president and prominent Lake Villa citizen B.J. Hooper.\n\n=== Business Development ===\nLindenhurst's first business, Thor's Shell, stood at the intersection of Grand Avenue and Lindenhurst Drive. By 1960, the first major commercial development in Lindenhurst was the building of Linden Plaza, featuring Slove Bakery, Village Laundry, Linden Cleaners, and [[Piggly Wiggly]]. Other businesses established in Lindenhurst included Linden [[Texaco]], Linden Barber Shop, [[Ben Franklin Stores|Ben Franklin Variety Store]], and Stretch-A-Dollar Clothing Store. The Lindenhurst Civic Center built its own facility in 1961 using the remains of the original Lindenhurst Farm ice house to anchor its building. It served as a meeting place for groups and organizations, card parties, socials, polling place, wedding receptions and family reunions. A school for the old Lindenhurst farm served as [[Village hall|Village Hall]] until it burned down, and the offices moved to Linden Plaza. By 1970, the village numbered 3,141 people. The village offices couldn't be crammed into Linden Plaza any longer, and the new village hall that was built in 1974 housed office space, the mayor, the police department, the building inspector, and the village garage.\n\n=== Public Safety ===\nThe Lindenhurst police force was all-volunteer at first, buying their own uniforms and using their own cars; fundraisers were held to pay for salaries and a patrol car. A full-time police position was created in 1963, and the village acquired a reputation as a \"[[speed trap]]\", due to radar use by the police. Lindenhurst became front-page headline material on November 27, 2006, when the village's first [[homicide]] in over nine years took place. A [[Burger King]] manager was killed in an apparent robbery at the national fast-food chain's Lindenhurst franchise.\n\nIn  1965, the village created its first sanitary district, replacing individual [[septic system]]s with a [[sanitary sewer|sewer system]]. Streets were paved and gutters installed during this period as well. Ted Flanagan was reelected mayor in 1969 and served until 1983.\n\n=== Community ===\nBesides the village's 25th anniversary, the 1980s brought the village, [[cable TV]] access, [[fast food]], and a budget of $1.5 million. Lindenfest was founded by volunteers in 1983. It grew out of tents and booths set up by local clubs and organizations in the village hall parking lot. Today it has a [[carnival]], games, contests, marathons, and music. Other additions to Lindenhurst in recent years include Victory Lakes, the Lindenhurst-Lake Villa Chamber of Commerce, and the Lindenhurst Park District.\n\nThe population in 1990 was 8,044 and is over 14,000 today. In a 1999 ''Lake Villa and Lindenhurst Review'' article, Village Administrator James Stevens said that Lindenhurst \"has been able to keep the small town flavor, in large part, through selective land annexation, and by carefully choosing developers for high quality but diversified housing types, including single family, town homes and condominiums. And all the housing types have to be integrated with the lakes, marshes, open space and forested areas of the village.\" The Lindenhurst motto is \"Developing Today for Tomorrow\".\n\n==Geography==\nLindenhurst is located at {{coord|42|24|37|N|88|1|34|W|type:city}} (42.41053, -88.02624).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the 2010 census, Lindenhurst has a total area of {{convert|4.774|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|4.44|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 93%) is land and {{convert|0.334|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 7%) is water.<ref name=\"census-g001\">{{cite web\n  |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1743770\n  |title=G001 \u2013 Geographic Identifiers \u2013 2010 Census Summary File 1\n  |accessdate=2015-08-04\n  |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]\n  |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213064756/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US1743770\n  |archive-date=2020-02-13\n  |url-status=dead\n  }}</ref>\n\nLindenhurst's first stop light was erected at Grand Avenue and Sand Lake Road in the 1980s.\n\n===Major streets===\n* [[File:US 45.svg|20px]]\n* [[File:Illinois 132.svg|20px]] Grand Avenue\n* Grass Lake Road\n* Savage Road\n* Gelden Road\n* Deep Lake Road\n* Granada Boulevard\n* Sand Lake Road\n* Beck Road\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1960= 1259\n|1970= 3141\n|1980= 6220\n|1990= 8038\n|2000= 12539\n|2010= 14462\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=14328\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 3, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/decennial.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 14,462 people residing in the village.

In 1816 he enforced his new proclamation against trespassing on the Government Domain by having three trespassers (all free settlers) flogged.

Foreign coins were common in the early years of the New South Wales colony but much of this coin left the colony as a result of trade with visiting merchant ships. To secure a reliable supply of coins, in 1812 Macquarie purchased 40,000 [[Spanish dollar]] coins and had a convicted forger named William Henshall cut the centres out of the coins and counter stamp them to distinguish them as belonging to the colony of New South Wales and prevent them being useful elsewhere.

Foreign coins were common in the early years of the New South Wales colony but much of this coin left the colony as a result of trade with visiting merchant ships. To secure a reliable supply of coins, in 1812 Macquarie purchased 40,000 [[Spanish dollar]] coins and had a convicted forger named William Henshall cut the centres out of the coins and counter stamp them to distinguish them as belonging to the colony of New South Wales and prevent them being useful elsewhere.

He was a [[sepoy]] (sipahi) in the 34th [[Bengal Regiment|Bengal Native Infantry]] (BNI) regiment of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]]. In 1984, the [[Government of India|Indian government]] issued a postage stamp to remember him. His life and actions have also been portrayed in several cinematic productions.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Pattern1853Rifle.jpg|thumb|right| [[Enfield Rifle]]]]\n{{Main article|Indian Rebellion of 1857}}\nMangal Pandey was born on 19 July 1827 in a [[Bhumihar Brahmin|Bhumihar]] Brahmin family at [[Nagwa]], a village of upper [[Ballia district]], [[Ceded and Conquered Provinces]] (now in [[Uttar Pradesh]]). He had joined the [[Bengal Army]] in 1849. In March 1857, Pandey was a private soldier in the 5th [[Company (military unit)|Company]] of the 34th Bengal Native Infantry.<ref name=\"Saul David page 69\">[[#David|David]], p. 69</ref>\n\nOn the afternoon of 29 March 1857, Lieutenant Baugh, [[Adjutant]] of the 34th Bengal Native Infantry, then stationed at [[Barrackpore]] was informed that several men of his regiment were in an excited state. Further, it was reported to him that one of them, Mangal Pandey, was pacing in front of the regiment's guard room by the parade ground, armed with a loaded [[musket]], calling upon the men to rebel and threatening to shoot the first European that he set eyes on. Testimony at a subsequent enquiry recorded that Pandey, unsettled by unrest amongst the sepoys and intoxicated by the narcotic [[bhang]], had seized weapons and run to the quarter-guard building upon learning that a detachment of British soldiers was disembarking from a steamer near the cantonment.<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 82</ref>\n\nBaugh immediately armed himself and galloped on his horse to the lines. Pandey took position behind the station gun, which was in front of the quarter-guard of the 34th, took aim at Baugh and fired. He missed Baugh, but the bullet struck his horse in the flank bringing both the horse and its rider down. Baugh quickly disentangled himself and, seizing one of his pistols, advanced towards Pandey and fired. He missed. Before Baugh could draw his sword, Pandey attacked him with a ''[[talwar]]'' (a heavy Indian sword) and closing with the adjutant, slashed Baugh on the shoulder and neck and brought him to the ground. It was then that another sepoy, [[Shaikh Paltu]], intervened and tried to restrain Pandey even as he tried to reload his musket.<ref name=\"Saul David page 70\">[[#David|David]], p. 70</ref>\n\nA British [[Sergeant-Major]] named Hewson had arrived on the parade ground, summoned by a native officer, before Baugh. He had ordered [[Jemadar]] Ishwari Prasad, the Indian officer in command of the quarter-guard, to arrest Pandey. To this, the ''jemadar'' stated that his NCOs had gone for help and that he could not take Pandey by himself.<ref name=\"Saul David page 69\">[[#David|David]], p. 69</ref> In response Hewson ordered Ishwari Prasad to fall in the guard with loaded weapons. In the meantime, Baugh had arrived on the field shouting 'Where is he? Where is he?' Hewson in reply called out to Baugh, 'Ride to the right, sir, for your life. The sepoy will fire at you!'<ref name=\"Hibbert\">{{cite book|author=Christopher Hibbert|title=The Great Mutiny: India, 1857|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QyoKAQAAIAAJ|year=1980|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=68\u201370}}</ref> At that point Pandey fired.\n\nHewson had charged towards Pandey as he was fighting with Lieutenant Baugh. While confronting Pandey, Hewson was knocked to the ground from behind by a blow from Pandey's musket.  The sound of the firing had brought other sepoys from the barracks; they remained mute spectators.  At this juncture, Shaikh Paltu, while trying to defend the two Englishmen called upon the other sepoys to assist him. Assailed by other sepoys, who threw stones and shoes at his back, he called on the guard to help him hold Pandey, but they threatened to shoot him if he did not let go of the mutineer.<ref name=\"Hibbert\"/>\n\nSome of the sepoys of the quarter-guard then advanced and struck at the two prostrate officers. They then threatened Shaikh Paltu and ordered him to release Pandey, whom he had been vainly trying to hold back.  However, Paltu continued to hold Pandey until Baugh and the sergeant-major was able to get up. Himself wounded by now, Paltu was obliged to loosen his grip.  He backed away in one direction and Baugh and Hewson in another, while being struck with the butt ends of the guards' muskets.<ref name=\"Hibbert\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, a report of the incident had been carried to the commanding officer General Hearsey, who then galloped to the ground with his two officer sons. Taking in the scene, he rode up to the guard, drew his pistol and ordered them to do their duty by seizing Mangal Pandey. The General threatened to shoot the first man who disobeyed. The men of the quarter-guard fell in and followed Hearsey towards Pandey. Pandey then put the muzzle of the musket to his chest and discharged it by pressing the trigger with his foot. He collapsed bleeding, with his regimental jacket on fire, but not mortally wounded.<ref name=\"Hibbert\"/>\n\nPandey recovered and was brought to trial less than a week later. When asked whether he had been under the influence of any substances, he stated steadfastly that he had mutinied on his own accord and that no other person had played any part in encouraging him. He was sentenced to death by [[hanging]], along with [[Jemadar]] Ishwari Prasad, after three Sikh members of the quarter-guard testified that the latter had ordered them not to arrest Pandey.<ref name=\"Hibbert\"/>\n\nMangal Pandey's execution was scheduled for 18 April but was carried out ten days before that date. Jemadar Ishwari Prasad was executed by hanging on 21 April.<ref name=\"Hibbert\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Sepoy Mutiny 1857.png|thumb|A scene from the 1857 Indian Rebellion]]\nThe 34th B.N.I. Regiment was disbanded \"with disgrace\" on 6 May as a collective punishment, after an investigation by the government, for failing to perform their duty in restraining a mutinous soldier and their officer. That came after a period of six weeks while petitions for leniency were examined in Calcutta. Sepoy Shaikh Paltu was promoted to [[havildar]] (sergeant) for his behavior on 29 March but he was murdered in an isolated part of the Barrackpore cantonment shortly before the regiment was disbanded.<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 97</ref>\n\nThe Indian historian [[Surendra Nath Sen]] notes that the 34th B.N.I. had a good recent record and that the Court of Enquiry had not found any evidence of a connection with unrest at [[Berhampore]] involving the 19th B.N.I. four weeks before (see below). However, Mangal Pandey's actions and the failure of the armed and on-duty sepoys of the quarter-guard to take action convinced the British military authorities that the whole regiment was unreliable. It appeared that Pandey had acted without first taking other sepoys into his confidence but that antipathy towards their British officers within the regiment had led most of those present to act as spectators, rather than obey orders.<ref name=\"Durendra Nath Sen page 50\">[[#Sen|Sen]], p. 50</ref>\n\n==Motivation==\nThe personal motivation behind Mangal Pandey's behaviour remains confused. During the incident itself he shouted to other sepoys: \"come out \u2013 the Europeans are here\"; \"from biting these cartridges we shall become infidels\" and \"you sent me out here, why don't you follow me\". At his court-martial, he stated that he had been taking bhang and opium, and was not conscious of his actions on 29 March.<ref>[[#David|David]], p. 72</ref>\n\nThere were a wide range of factors causing apprehension and mistrust in the Bengal Army immediately prior to the Barrackpore event. Pandey's reference to cartridges is usually attributed to a new type of [[Cartridge (firearms)|bullet cartridge]] used in the [[Royal Small Arms Factory|Enfield]] [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|P-53 rifle]] which was to be introduced in the Bengal Army that year. The cartridge was thought to be greased with animal fat, primarily from cows and pigs, which could not be consumed by [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s respectively (the former a holy animal of the Hindus and the latter being abhorrent to Muslims). The cartridges had to be bitten at one end before use. The Indian troops in some regiments were of the opinion that this was an intentional act of the British, with the aim of defiling their religions.<ref>{{cite book| author=[[Philip Mason]]| title=A Matter of Honour| date=1974| ISBN=0-333-41837-9| page=267}}</ref>\n\nColonel S. Wheeler of the 34th B.N.I. was known as a zealous Christian preacher. The wife of Captain William Halliday of the 56th B.N.I. had the [[Bible]] printed in [[Urdu]] and [[Hindi]] and distributed among the sepoys, thus raising suspicions amongst them that the British were intent on converting them to Christianity.<ref name=\"Hibbert\"/>\n\nThe 19th and 34th Bengal Native Infantry were stationed at [[Lucknow]] during the time of the annexation of [[Oudh]] in 1856 because of alleged misgovernment by the Nawab. The annexation had negative implications for sepoys in the Bengal Army (a significant portion of whom came from that princely state). Before the annexation, these sepoys had the right to petition the British Resident at Lucknow for justice \u2014 a significant privilege in the context of native courts. As a result of the East India Company's action, they lost that special status, since Oudh no longer existed as a nominally independent political entity.<ref>{{cite book| author=Philip Mason| title=A Matter of Honour| date=1974| ISBN=0-333-41837-9| page=295}}</ref>\n\nThe 19th B.N.I. is important because it was the regiment charged with testing the new cartridges on 26 February 1857. However, right up to the mutiny the new rifles had not been issued to them, and the cartridges in the magazine of the regiment were as free of grease as they had been through the preceding half-century. The paper used in wrapping the cartridges was of a different colour, arousing suspicions. The non-commissioned officers of the regiment refused to accept the cartridges on 26 February. This information was conveyed to the commanding officer, Colonel William Mitchell; he took it upon himself to try to convince the sepoys that the cartridges were no different from those they had been accustomed to and that they need not bite it. He concluded his exhortation with an appeal to the native officers to uphold the honour of the regiment and a threat to [[court-martial]] such sepoys as refused to accept the cartridge. However, the next morning the sepoys of the regiment seized their bell of arms (weapons store). The subsequent conciliatory behaviour of Mitchell convinced the sepoys to return to their barracks.<ref name=\"Surendra Nath Sen page 48\">[[#Sen|Sen]], p. 48</ref>\n\n===Court of Enquiry===\nA Court of Enquiry was ordered which, after an investigation lasting nearly a month, recommended the disbanding of the 19th B.N.I. The same was carried out on 31 March. The 19th B.N.I. were allowed to retain items of uniform and were provided by the government with allowances to return to their homes. Both Colonel Mitchell of the 19th B.N.I. and (subsequent to the incident of 29 March) Colonel Wheeler of Pandey's 34th B.N.I. were declared unsuited to take charge of any new regiments raised to replace the disbanded units.<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 96</ref>\n\n===Consequences===\nThe attack by and punishment of Pandey is widely seen as the opening scene of what came to be known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Knowledge of his action was widespread amongst his fellow sepoys and is assumed to have been one of the factors leading to the general series of mutinies that broke out during the following months. Mangal Pandey would prove to be influential for later figures in the Indian Nationalist Movement like V.D. Savarkar, who viewed his motive as one of the earliest manifestations of Indian Nationalism. Modern Indian nationalists portray Pandey as the mastermind behind a conspiracy to revolt against the British, although a recently published analysis of events immediately preceding the outbreak concludes that \"there is little historical evidence to back up any of these revisionist interpretations\".<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 245</ref>\n\nDuring the rebellion that followed, Pandee or Pandey became the derogatory term used by British soldiers and civilians when referring to a mutinous sepoy. This was a direct derivation from the name of Mangal Pandey.<ref>{{cite book|first=William|last=Dalrymple|page=[https://archive.org/details/lastmughalfallof0000dalr/page/148 148]|title=The Last Mughal|ISBN=978-0-7475-8726-2|url=https://archive.org/details/lastmughalfallof0000dalr/page/148}}</ref>\n\n==Film, stage and literature==\nA film based on the sequence of events that led up to the mutiny entitled ''[[Mangal Pandey: The Rising]]'' starring Indian actor, [[Aamir Khan]] along with [[Rani Mukerji]], [[Amisha Patel]] and [[Toby Stephens]], directed by [[Ketan Mehta]] was released on 12 August 2005.\n\nThe life of Pandey was the subject of a stage play titled ''The Roti Rebellion'', which was written and directed by Supriya Karunakaran. The play was organized by Sparsh, a theatre group, and presented in June 2005 at The Moving Theatre at Andhra Saraswat Parishad, [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]], [[Andhra Pradesh]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2005/06/08/stories/2005060800760400.htm |work=The Hindu |title=Review of ''The Roti Rebellion'' |date=8 June 2005}}</ref>\n\nSamad Iqbal, a fictional descendant of Mangal Pandey, is a central character in [[Zadie Smith]]'s debut novel ''[[White Teeth]]''.

However, Paltu continued to hold Pandey until Baugh and the sergeant-major was able to get up. Himself wounded by now, Paltu was obliged to loosen his grip.  He backed away in one direction and Baugh and Hewson in another, while being struck with the butt ends of the guards' muskets.<ref name=\"Hibbert\"/>\n\nIn the meantime, a report of the incident had been carried to the commanding officer General Hearsey, who then galloped to the ground with his two officer sons. Taking in the scene, he rode up to the guard, drew his pistol and ordered them to do their duty by seizing Mangal Pandey. The General threatened to shoot the first man who disobeyed. The men of the quarter-guard fell in and followed Hearsey towards Pandey. Pandey then put the muzzle of the musket to his chest and discharged it by pressing the trigger with his foot. He collapsed bleeding, with his regimental jacket on fire, but not mortally wounded.<ref name=\"Hibbert\"/>\n\nPandey recovered and was brought to trial less than a week later. When asked whether he had been under the influence of any substances, he stated steadfastly that he had mutinied on his own accord and that no other person had played any part in encouraging him. He was sentenced to death by [[hanging]], along with [[Jemadar]] Ishwari Prasad, after three Sikh members of the quarter-guard testified that the latter had ordered them not to arrest Pandey.<ref name=\"Hibbert\"/>\n\nMangal Pandey's execution was scheduled for 18 April but was carried out ten days before that date. Jemadar Ishwari Prasad was executed by hanging on 21 April.<ref name=\"Hibbert\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Sepoy Mutiny 1857.png|thumb|A scene from the 1857 Indian Rebellion]]\nThe 34th B.N.I. Regiment was disbanded \"with disgrace\" on 6 May as a collective punishment, after an investigation by the government, for failing to perform their duty in restraining a mutinous soldier and their officer. That came after a period of six weeks while petitions for leniency were examined in Calcutta. Sepoy Shaikh Paltu was promoted to [[havildar]] (sergeant) for his behavior on 29 March but he was murdered in an isolated part of the Barrackpore cantonment shortly before the regiment was disbanded.<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 97</ref>\n\nThe Indian historian [[Surendra Nath Sen]] notes that the 34th B.N.I. had a good recent record and that the Court of Enquiry had not found any evidence of a connection with unrest at [[Berhampore]] involving the 19th B.N.I. four weeks before (see below). However, Mangal Pandey's actions and the failure of the armed and on-duty sepoys of the quarter-guard to take action convinced the British military authorities that the whole regiment was unreliable. It appeared that Pandey had acted without first taking other sepoys into his confidence but that antipathy towards their British officers within the regiment had led most of those present to act as spectators, rather than obey orders.<ref name=\"Durendra Nath Sen page 50\">[[#Sen|Sen]], p. 50</ref>\n\n==Motivation==\nThe personal motivation behind Mangal Pandey's behaviour remains confused. During the incident itself he shouted to other sepoys: \"come out \u2013 the Europeans are here\"; \"from biting these cartridges we shall become infidels\" and \"you sent me out here, why don't you follow me\". At his court-martial, he stated that he had been taking bhang and opium, and was not conscious of his actions on 29 March.<ref>[[#David|David]], p. 72</ref>\n\nThere were a wide range of factors causing apprehension and mistrust in the Bengal Army immediately prior to the Barrackpore event. Pandey's reference to cartridges is usually attributed to a new type of [[Cartridge (firearms)|bullet cartridge]] used in the [[Royal Small Arms Factory|Enfield]] [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|P-53 rifle]] which was to be introduced in the Bengal Army that year. The cartridge was thought to be greased with animal fat, primarily from cows and pigs, which could not be consumed by [[Hindu]]s and [[Muslim]]s respectively (the former a holy animal of the Hindus and the latter being abhorrent to Muslims). The cartridges had to be bitten at one end before use. The Indian troops in some regiments were of the opinion that this was an intentional act of the British, with the aim of defiling their religions.<ref>{{cite book| author=[[Philip Mason]]| title=A Matter of Honour| date=1974| ISBN=0-333-41837-9| page=267}}</ref>\n\nColonel S. Wheeler of the 34th B.N.I. was known as a zealous Christian preacher. The wife of Captain William Halliday of the 56th B.N.I. had the [[Bible]] printed in [[Urdu]] and [[Hindi]] and distributed among the sepoys, thus raising suspicions amongst them that the British were intent on converting them to Christianity.<ref name=\"Hibbert\"/>\n\nThe 19th and 34th Bengal Native Infantry were stationed at [[Lucknow]] during the time of the annexation of [[Oudh]] in 1856 because of alleged misgovernment by the Nawab. The annexation had negative implications for sepoys in the Bengal Army (a significant portion of whom came from that princely state). Before the annexation, these sepoys had the right to petition the British Resident at Lucknow for justice \u2014 a significant privilege in the context of native courts. As a result of the East India Company's action, they lost that special status, since Oudh no longer existed as a nominally independent political entity.<ref>{{cite book| author=Philip Mason| title=A Matter of Honour| date=1974| ISBN=0-333-41837-9| page=295}}</ref>\n\nThe 19th B.N.I. is important because it was the regiment charged with testing the new cartridges on 26 February 1857. However, right up to the mutiny the new rifles had not been issued to them, and the cartridges in the magazine of the regiment were as free of grease as they had been through the preceding half-century. The paper used in wrapping the cartridges was of a different colour, arousing suspicions. The non-commissioned officers of the regiment refused to accept the cartridges on 26 February. This information was conveyed to the commanding officer, Colonel William Mitchell; he took it upon himself to try to convince the sepoys that the cartridges were no different from those they had been accustomed to and that they need not bite it. He concluded his exhortation with an appeal to the native officers to uphold the honour of the regiment and a threat to [[court-martial]] such sepoys as refused to accept the cartridge. However, the next morning the sepoys of the regiment seized their bell of arms (weapons store). The subsequent conciliatory behaviour of Mitchell convinced the sepoys to return to their barracks.<ref name=\"Surendra Nath Sen page 48\">[[#Sen|Sen]], p. 48</ref>\n\n===Court of Enquiry===\nA Court of Enquiry was ordered which, after an investigation lasting nearly a month, recommended the disbanding of the 19th B.N.I. The same was carried out on 31 March. The 19th B.N.I. were allowed to retain items of uniform and were provided by the government with allowances to return to their homes. Both Colonel Mitchell of the 19th B.N.I. and (subsequent to the incident of 29 March) Colonel Wheeler of Pandey's 34th B.N.I. were declared unsuited to take charge of any new regiments raised to replace the disbanded units.<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 96</ref>\n\n===Consequences===\nThe attack by and punishment of Pandey is widely seen as the opening scene of what came to be known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Knowledge of his action was widespread amongst his fellow sepoys and is assumed to have been one of the factors leading to the general series of mutinies that broke out during the following months. Mangal Pandey would prove to be influential for later figures in the Indian Nationalist Movement like V.D. Savarkar, who viewed his motive as one of the earliest manifestations of Indian Nationalism. Modern Indian nationalists portray Pandey as the mastermind behind a conspiracy to revolt against the British, although a recently published analysis of events immediately preceding the outbreak concludes that \"there is little historical evidence to back up any of these revisionist interpretations\".<ref>[[#Wagner|Wagner]], p. 245</ref>\n\nDuring the rebellion that followed, Pandee or Pandey became the derogatory term used by British soldiers and civilians when referring to a mutinous sepoy. This was a direct derivation from the name of Mangal Pandey.<ref>{{cite book|first=William|last=Dalrymple|page=[https://archive.org/details/lastmughalfallof0000dalr/page/148 148]|title=The Last Mughal|ISBN=978-0-7475-8726-2|url=https://archive.org/details/lastmughalfallof0000dalr/page/148}}</ref>\n\n==Film, stage and literature==\nA film based on the sequence of events that led up to the mutiny entitled ''[[Mangal Pandey: The Rising]]'' starring Indian actor, [[Aamir Khan]] along with [[Rani Mukerji]], [[Amisha Patel]] and [[Toby Stephens]], directed by [[Ketan Mehta]] was released on 12 August 2005.\n\nThe life of Pandey was the subject of a stage play titled ''The Roti Rebellion'', which was written and directed by Supriya Karunakaran.

[[News magazine]]s are also weekly, but they have a [[magazine]] format.{{Anchor|Article_type_summary_in_lower_lede}} General-interest newspapers typically publish [[article (publishing)#News articles|news articles]] and [[feature story|feature articles]] on national and international news as well as [[local news]]. The news includes [[political journalism|political events and personalities]], [[business journalism|business and finance]], crime, weather, and natural disasters; [[medical journalism|health and medicine]], [[science journalism|science]], and computers and technology; [[sports journalism|sports]]; and [[entertainment journalism|entertainment]], [[society reporting|society]], food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and [[the arts]].\n\nUsually the paper is divided into sections for each of those major groupings (labeled A, B, C, and so on, with pagination prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing [[editorial]]s written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called \"[[op-ed]]s\" written by guest writers (which are typically in the same section as the editorial), and [[column (periodical)|columns]] that express the personal opinions of [[columnist]]s, usually offering analysis and synthesis that attempts to translate the raw [[data]] of the news into information telling the reader \"what it all means\" and persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles which have no [[byline]]; these articles are written by staff writers.\n\nA wide variety of material has been published in newspapers. Besides the aforementioned news, information and opinions, they include weather forecasts; criticism and reviews of the arts (including [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], [[theater]], [[fine arts]], and [[architecture]]) and of local services such as restaurants; [[obituary|obituaries]], birth notices and graduation announcements; entertainment features such as crosswords, horoscopes, [[editorial cartoon]]s, [[gag cartoon]]s, and [[comic strip]]s; [[advice column|advice]] columns, [[food column|food]], and other columns; and radio and television listings (program schedules). As of 2017, newspapers may also provide information about new movies and TV shows available on [[streaming video]] services like [[Netflix]]. Newspapers have [[classified ad]] sections where people and businesses can buy small advertisements to sell goods or services; as of 2013, the huge increase in [[Internet]] websites for selling goods, such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]] has led to significantly less classified ad sales for newspapers.\n\nMost newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of [[Subscription business model|subscription]] revenue, [[newsagent's shop|newsstand sales]], and advertising revenue (other businesses or individuals pay to place advertisements in the pages, including [[newspaper display advertising|display ads]], [[classified advertising|classified ads]], and [[online advertising|their online equivalents]]). Some newspapers are government-run or at least government-funded; their reliance on advertising revenue and on profitability is less critical to their survival. The [[editorial independence]] of a newspaper is thus always subject to the [[wikt:interest|interests]] of someone, whether owners, advertisers, or a government. Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [http://xn--i1b2c9a6al9be8bbdn.com/ newspapers of record.]\n\nMany newspapers, besides employing journalists on their own payrolls, also subscribe to [[news agency|news agencies]] (wire services) (such as the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], or [[Agence France-Presse]]), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the [[content (media)|content]] to the various newspapers. This is a way to avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55&nbsp;million copies).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieworld.com/cc/NewspaperADailyMiracle.pdf|title=''A Daily Miracle: A student guide to journalism and the newspaper business'' (2007)|date=|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> The [[Great Recession|late 2000s\u2013early 2010s global recession]], combined with the rapid growth of free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses.<ref>{{cite news|author=Plambeck, Joseph|title=Newspaper Circulation Falls Nearly 9%|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html?scp=3&sq=newspapers&st=Search|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 April 2010}}</ref> Worldwide annual revenue approached $100&nbsp;billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9.

Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the [[World Wide Web|web]]) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by [[crowdsourcing]] both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, [[journalism]] (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of [[news aggregator]]s, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of [[web traffic]]. Increasing [[paywall]]ing of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the '''''[[Ordinari Post Tijdender]]''''', which was established in [[Stockholm]] in 1645.\n\n===Definitions===\n[http://xn--i1b2c9a6al9be8bbdn.com/ Newspapers] typically meet four criteria:<ref>Werner Faulstich: \"Grundwissen Medien\", 4th ed., ya UTB, 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-8252-8169-4}}, chapter 4</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rehm|first=Margarete|url=http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~wumsta/infopub/textbook/umfeld/rehm5.html|title=Margarete Rehm: Information und Kommunikaegenwart.

Many editors were not only journalists but also writers, philosophers and politicians. With unofficial journals, these intellectuals encouraged public discourse on politics in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[History of Iran|Persian]] Empires. Literary works of all genres were serialized and published in the press as well.\n\nThe first newspapers in the Ottoman Empire were owned by foreigners living there who wanted to make propaganda about the Western world.<ref>Stavrianos, p. 211.</ref> The earliest was printed in 1795 by the Palais de France in [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]].

Meggs, ''A History of Graphic Design'' (1998) pp 130\u2013133</ref> Soon, this press was adapted to print on both sides of a page at once.

More specialist still are some weekly newspapers, usually free and distributed within limited regional areas; these may serve communities as specific as certain immigrant populations, the local [[gay]] community or [[indie rock]] enthusiasts within a city or region.\n\n===Frequency===\n\n====Daily====\nA '''daily newspaper''' is printed every day, sometimes with the exception of Sundays and occasionally Saturdays, (and some major holidays)<ref>Example of Monday to Friday-only publishing: the London [[Evening Standard]], once a paid newspaper, now free-of-charge, aimed largely at commuters, does not publish on Saturdays</ref> and often of some [[List of holidays by country|national holidays]]. Saturday and, where they exist, Sunday editions of daily newspapers tend to be larger, include more specialized sections (e.g., on arts, films, entertainment) and advertising inserts, and cost more. Typically, the majority of these newspapers' staff members work Monday to Friday, so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in advance or content that is syndicated. Most daily newspapers are sold in the morning.\n\nAfternoon or evening papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed more at commuters and office workers. In practice (though this may vary according to country), a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on the night before its [[cover date]], further editions being printed and distributed during the night. The later editions can include [[breaking news]] which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already printed. Previews of tomorrow's newspapers are often a feature of late night news programs, such as [[Newsnight]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. In 1650, the first daily newspaper appeared,  ''Einkommende Zeitung'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leipzig.de/buergerservice-und-verwaltung/unsere-stadt/stadtgeschichte/historisches-aus-1000-jahren/erste-tageszeitung-kam-aus-leipzig/|title=Erste Tageszeitung kam aus Leipzig|author=|date=|website=www.leipzig.de}}</ref> published by [[Timotheus Ritzsch]] in [[Leipzig]], Germany.<ref>Johannes Weber, . \"Strassburg, 1605: The origins of the newspaper in Europe.\" ''German History'' 24.3 (2006): 387-412.</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom and some other Commonwealth countries, unlike most other countries, \"daily\" newspapers do not publish on Sundays. In the past there were independent Sunday newspapers; nowadays the same publisher often produces a [[Sunday newspaper]], distinct in many ways from the daily, usually with a related name; e.g., ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' are distinct newspapers owned by the same company, and an article published in the latter would never be credited to ''The Times''.\n\nIn some cases a Sunday edition is an expanded version of a newspaper from the same publisher; in other cases, particularly in Britain, it may be a separate enterprise, e.g., ''[[The Observer]]'', not affiliated with a daily newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1993. Usually, it is a specially expanded edition, often several times the thickness and weight of the weekday editions and contain generally special sections not found in the weekday editions, such as [[Sunday comics]], Sunday magazines (such as ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'').\n\nIn some countries daily newspapers are not published on [[Christmas Day]], but weekly newspapers would change their day e.g. Sunday newspapers are published on Saturday December 24, [[Christmas Eve]] when [[Christmas Day]] is falling on Sunday.\n\n====Weekly and other====\n{{main|Weekly newspaper}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 133-075, Worms, Antisemitische Presse, \"St\u00fcrmerkasten\".jpg|thumb|Public reading of the anti-Semitic weekly newspaper ''[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]'', [[Worms, Germany]], 1935]]\n[[Weekly newspaper]]s are published once a week, and tend to be smaller than daily papers. Some newspapers are published two or three times a week and are known as semi-weekly publications. Some publications are published, for example, fortnightly (or biweekly in American parlance). They have a change from normal weekly day of the week during the Christmas period depending the day of the week [[Christmas Day]] is falling on.\n\n===Geographical scope and distribution===\n\n====Local or regional====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nA '''local newspaper''' serves a region such as a city, or part of a large city.\nAlmost every market has one or two newspapers that dominate the area.

Some, such as ''[[The New York Times International Edition]]'', (formerly The International Herald Tribune) have always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or \"international editions\" of national or large metropolitan newspapers. In some cases, articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted from international editions; in others, of interest to [[expatriates]], significant national news is retained. As English became the international language of business and technology, many newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed English-language editions. In places as varied as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Mumbai]], newspapers are printed for a local and international English-speaking public, and for tourists. The advent of the Internet has also allowed non-English-language newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.\n\nSimilarly, in many countries with a large foreign-language-speaking population or many tourists, newspapers in languages other than the national language are both published locally and imported. For example, newspapers and magazines from many countries, and [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom#Non-English-language newspapers|locally published newspapers in many languages]], are readily to be found on news-stands in central London. In the US state of [[Florida]], so many tourists from the French-speaking Canadian province of [[Quebec]] visit for long stays during the winter (\"[[snowbird (person)|snowbirds]]\") that some newsstands and stores sell French-language newspapers such as ''[[Le Droit]]''.\n\n===Subject matter===\nGeneral newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no longer be called newspapers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-85461-0005, Berlin, Mauerbau, NVA-Panzersoldaten.jpg|thumb|upright|Soldiers in an [[East Germany|East German]] tank unit reading about the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961 in the newspaper [[Neues Deutschland]]]]\n\n====Print====\nFor centuries newspapers were printed on paper and supplied physically to readers either by local distribution, or in some cases by mail, for example for British expatriates living in India or Hong Kong who subscribed to British newspapers. Newspapers can be delivered to subscribers homes and/or businesses by a paper's own delivery people, sent via the [[mail]], sold at [[newsstand]]s, [[grocery store]]s and [[convenience store]]s, and delivered to [[library|libraries]] and [[bookstore]]s. Newspaper organizations need a large distribution system to deliver their papers to these different distributors, which typically involves delivery trucks and delivery people.\nIn recent years, newspapers and other media have adapted to the changing technology environment by starting to offer online editions to cater to the needs of the public. In the future, the trend towards more electronic delivery of the news will continue with more emphasis on the Internet, social media and other electronic delivery methods. However, while the method of delivery is changing, the newspaper and the industry still has a niche in the world.\n\n====[http://xn--i1b2c9a6al9be8bbdn.com/ Online]====\n{{Main|Online newspaper}}\nAs of 2007, virtually all major printed newspapers have online editions distributed over the Internet which, depending on the country may be regulated by journalism organizations such as the [[Press Complaints Commission]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story3152.shtml|title=Journalism Magazine|publisher=Journalism.co.uk|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> But as some publishers find their print-based models increasingly unsustainable,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2017/jan/24/winning-back-advertisers-is-key-to-saving-the-newspaper-industry|title=Guardian News and Media Limited|publisher=theguardian.com|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref> Web-based \"newspapers\" have also started to appear, such as the ''[[Southport Reporter]]'' in the UK and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', which stopped publishing in print after 149 years in March 2009 and became an online-only paper.\n\nSince 2005 in the UK more than 200 regional newspapers have closed down resulting in 50% decline in the number of regional journalists. A 2016 study done by King's College London found that the towns which lost their local newspapers receded from the democratic values and experienced the loss of public faith in the authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43106436|title=The death of the local newspaper?|last=|first=|date=20 February 2018|website=BBC|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nA new trend in newspaper publishing is the introduction of [[personalization]] through [[on-demand printing]] technologies or with online news aggregator websites like [[Google news]]. Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications. This \"Best of\" approach allows revival of the print-based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com, Twitter. times and many others. With these online newspapers, the reader can select how much of each section (politics, sports, arts, etc.) they wish to see in their news.\n\n==Organization and personnel==\n[[File:Gazeta Lubuska newsroom.jpg|thumb|left|The newsroom of Gazeta Lubuska in [[Zielona G\u00f3ra]], Poland]]\nIn the United States, the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper is the publisher.<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Guide to Industries, 2010\u201311 Edition: Publishing, Except Software|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|author=Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself\u2014editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names\u2014as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.\n\nThroughout the English-speaking world, the person who selects the content for the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor. Variations on this title such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on are common. For small newspapers, a single editor may be responsible for all content areas. At large newspapers, the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication, while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area, such as local news or sports. These divisions are called [[news bureau]]s or \"desks\", and each is supervised by a designated editor. Most newspaper editors [[copy edit]] the stories for their part of the newspaper, but they may share their workload with [[proofreader]]s and [[fact checker]]s.\n[[File:Newsboy in 1905.jpg|thumb|A [[Newspaper delivery|newsboy]] in 1905 selling the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' in Canada]]\n\n[[Reporter]]s are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and [[graphic artist]]s provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a [[Beat reporting|beat]], such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. [[Printer (publishing)|Printers]] and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, partly because of the cost of an [[Offset printing|offset web press]] (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's [[print run]] might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, [[webmaster]]s and [[web designer]]s may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.\n\nThe staff of the [[Newspaper circulation|circulation department]] liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper; sell subscriptions; and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail, by [[newspaper carrier]]s, at retailers, and through vending machines. [[Free newspapers]] do not sell subscriptions, but they still have a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers. Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell ad space to clients such as local businesses, but also help clients design and plan their advertising campaigns. Other members of the advertising department may include [[graphic designer]]s, who design ads according to the customers' specifications and the department's policies. In an [[Advertising-free media|advertising-free newspaper]], there is no advertising department.\n\n==Zoned and other editions==\n[[File:Newspapers.jpg|thumb|Israeli daily newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', seen in its [[Hebrew]] and English language editions]]\nNewspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising\u2014the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial\u2014or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content.

Since the 1980s, the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower-quality [[letterpress printing]] to higher-quality, [[CMYK color model|four-color process]], [[offset printing]]. In addition, desktop computers, [[word processor|word processing software]], [[graphics software]], [[digital camera]]s and digital [[prepress]] and [[typesetting]] technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative [[Page layout|layouts]] and better design.\n\nTo help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and [[Sheffield]]'s weekly sports publication derives its name, the ''[[Green Un|Green 'Un]]'', from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' is also printed on pink paper while ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'' (formerly ''L'Auto'') is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the [[Giro d'Italia]] wears a pink jersey.\n\n==Circulation and readership==\n{{Main|List of newspapers in the World by circulation|Newspaper circulation|Ageing of newspaper readership}}\n[[File:Newspaper vendor.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper vendor, [[Paddington]], London, February 2005]]\nThe number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the [[Alliance for Audited Media]] maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper ''[[Trud (Russian newspaper)|Trud]]'' exceeded 21,500,000 in 1990, while the Soviet weekly ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'' boasted a circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991. According to United Nations data from 1995 Japan has three daily papers\u2014the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', and ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]''\u2014with circulations well above 5.5&nbsp;million. Germany's ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]]'', with a circulation of 3.8&nbsp;million, was the only other paper in that category. In the United Kingdom, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' is the top seller, with around 3.24&nbsp;million copies distributed daily. In the U.S., ''The Wall Street Journal'' has a daily circulation of approximately 2.02&nbsp;million, making it the most widely distributed paper in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010138873_apusnewspapercirculation.html|title=Newspaper circulation drop accelerates April\u2013Sept|author=Liedtke, Michael|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=26 October 2009|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhile paid readership of print newspapers has been steadily declining in the developed [[OECD]] nations, it has been rising in the chief developing nations (Brazil, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), whose paid daily circulation exceeded those of the developed nations for the first time in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/30/24/45559596.pdf|title=The evolution of news and the internet|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|date=11 June 2010|accessdate=14 July 2011}}\"Growth in the BIICS countries by about 35% from 2000 to 2008 very much contributed to this growth, most notably India with a 45% increase in circulation between 2000 and 2008, South Africa (34%) and China (an estimated 29%).

In the 1920s, on a national basis in the U.S., daily newspapers achieved market penetration of 123 percent (meaning the average U.S. household received 1.23 newspapers). As other media began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market penetration began to decline. It wasn't until the early 1970s, however, that market penetration dipped below 100 percent. By 2000, it was 53 percent and still falling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/|title=Newspapers: Audience&nbsp;\u2013 State of the Media 2004|access-date=27 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828204802/http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2004/newspapers-intro/audience/|archive-date=28 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many paid-for newspapers offer a variety of subscription plans. For example, someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or maybe only a [[workweek]] subscription, or perhaps a daily subscription. Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet, either at no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks, or for a certain number of viewed articles, after which readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives are provided.\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:C & A Speciale Mantel-Aanbieding.jpg|thumb|1938 Dutch newspaper advertisement for women's clothing sold at [[C&A]] stores]]\nA newspaper typically generates 70\u201380% of its revenue from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions.<ref name=\"business_model_1996\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.academia.edu/4894990\n|title=Online Revenue Business Model Has Changed Little Since 1996|publisher=[[Newspaper Research Journal]]|author=Mensing, Donica|date=Spring 2007}}</ref> The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called ''editorial content'', ''editorial matter'', or simply ''editorial'', although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions. (This distinction, however, developed over time&nbsp;\u2013 early publishers like Girardin (France) and Zang (Austria) did not always distinguish paid items from editorial content.). The [[business model]] of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in 1833 by ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18904178|title=Reinventing the newspaper|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011|work=The Economist}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Naa newspaper ad revenue.svg|thumb|US Newspaper Advertising Revenue -  ''Newspaper Association of America published data''<ref name=NAAdata>{{cite web|title=Trends & Numbers |date=14 March 2012 |publisher=[[Newspaper Association of America]] |accessdate=18 September 2012 |url=http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918094825/http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |archivedate=18 September 2012 }}</ref>]]\n\nNewspapers in countries with easy access to the [[World Wide Web|web]] have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers. Department stores and supermarkets could be relied upon in the past to buy pages of newspaper advertisements, but due to industry consolidation are much less likely to do so now.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallstreetcosmos.com/newspaper_iindustry_report.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321044034/http://www.wallstreetcosmos.com/newspaper_iindustry_report.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 March 2008|title=wallstreetcosmos.com|publisher=wallstreetcosmos.com|accessdate=21 October 2012}}</ref> Additionally, newspapers are seeing traditional advertisers shift to new media platforms. The classified category is shifting to sites including [[Craigslist]], employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.\n\nIn recent years, the [[advertorial]] emerged. Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an [[Editorial|opposite-editorial]] which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. [[Advertorial]]s commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a [[press release]] than of an objective [[news story]]. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/16/blurring-lines-between-advertising-and-editorial|title = Dangerous blend: how lines between editorial and advertising are blurring|last = Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|first = Filloux|date = 16 May 2011|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Journalism==\n{{Main|Journalism}}\n[[File:Severnyi krai.jpg|thumb|The editorial staff of newspaper \"Severnyi Kray\" in [[Yaroslavl]], Russia in 1900]]\nSince newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called ''journalism''. In the [[yellow journalism]] era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around [[World War II]]. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived [[bias]]; and scandals involving [[plagiarism]] and fabrication.\n\nIn the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called [[press baron]]s, and were used for gaining a political voice. After 1920 most major newspapers became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as [[Gannett]], [[The McClatchy Company]], [[Hearst Corporation]], [[Cox Enterprises]], [[Landmark Media Enterprises LLC]], [[Morris Communications]], [[Tribune Company|The Tribune Company]], [[Hollinger Inc.|Hollinger International]], [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], [[Swift Communications]], etc. Newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who \"leak\" stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them. However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed. Recent research has examined the effects of a newspaper's closing on the reelection of incumbents, voter turnout, and campaign spending.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp686.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Do Newspapers Matter?'', 2011]</ref>\n\nOpinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the ''[[op-ed]]'' (\"opposite the editorial page\") and [[letter to the editor|''letters to the editors'']] sections of the paper. Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers, and asking sources to review articles after publication.\n\n==Impact of television and Internet==\n{{Main|Decline of newspapers}}\n{{Further|Online newspapers}}\n[[File:2010 newspaper press France 5125942563.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper press in [[Limoges]], France]]\nBy the late 1990s, the availability of news via 24-hour television channels and the subsequent availability of [[online journalism]] posed an ongoing challenge to the business model of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid [[newspaper circulation]] has declined, while advertising revenue\u2014the bulk of most newspapers' income\u2014has been shifting from print to [[social media]] and news websites, resulting in a general decline. One of the challenges is that a number of online news websites are free to access. Other online news sites have a [[paywall]] and require paid subscription for access. In less-developed countries, cheaper printing and distribution, increased literacy, a growing middle class, and other factors have compensated for the emergence of electronic media, and newspaper circulation continues to grow.<ref>N.

The [[journalism]] organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often [[metonymy|metonymically]] called newspapers.\n\nNewspapers have traditionally been published [[printing|in print]] (usually on cheap, low-grade [[paper]] called [[newsprint]]). However, today most newspapers are also [[electronic publishing|published]] on [[website]]s as [[online newspaper]]s, and some have even abandoned their print versions entirely.\n\nNewspapers developed in the 17th century, as [[newsletter|information sheets for merchants]]. By the early 19th century, many cities in Europe, as well as North and South America, published newspapers.\n\nSome newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\n== Overview ==\n\nNewspapers are typically published [[newspaper#Daily|daily]] or [[weekly newspaper|weekly]]. [[News magazine]]s are also weekly, but they have a [[magazine]] format.{{Anchor|Article_type_summary_in_lower_lede}} General-interest newspapers typically publish [[article (publishing)#News articles|news articles]] and [[feature story|feature articles]] on national and international news as well as [[local news]]. The news includes [[political journalism|political events and personalities]], [[business journalism|business and finance]], crime, weather, and natural disasters; [[medical journalism|health and medicine]], [[science journalism|science]], and computers and technology; [[sports journalism|sports]]; and [[entertainment journalism|entertainment]], [[society reporting|society]], food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and [[the arts]].\n\nUsually the paper is divided into sections for each of those major groupings (labeled A, B, C, and so on, with pagination prefixes yielding page numbers A1-A20, B1-B20, C1-C20, and so on). Most traditional papers also feature an editorial page containing [[editorial]]s written by an editor (or by the paper's editorial board) and expressing an opinion on a public issue, opinion articles called \"[[op-ed]]s\" written by guest writers (which are typically in the same section as the editorial), and [[column (periodical)|columns]] that express the personal opinions of [[columnist]]s, usually offering analysis and synthesis that attempts to translate the raw [[data]] of the news into information telling the reader \"what it all means\" and persuading them to concur. Papers also include articles which have no [[byline]]; these articles are written by staff writers.\n\nA wide variety of material has been published in newspapers. Besides the aforementioned news, information and opinions, they include weather forecasts; criticism and reviews of the arts (including [[literature]], [[film]], [[television]], [[theater]], [[fine arts]], and [[architecture]]) and of local services such as restaurants; [[obituary|obituaries]], birth notices and graduation announcements; entertainment features such as crosswords, horoscopes, [[editorial cartoon]]s, [[gag cartoon]]s, and [[comic strip]]s; [[advice column|advice]] columns, [[food column|food]], and other columns; and radio and television listings (program schedules). As of 2017, newspapers may also provide information about new movies and TV shows available on [[streaming video]] services like [[Netflix]]. Newspapers have [[classified ad]] sections where people and businesses can buy small advertisements to sell goods or services; as of 2013, the huge increase in [[Internet]] websites for selling goods, such as [[Craigslist]] and [[eBay]] has led to significantly less classified ad sales for newspapers.\n\nMost newspapers are businesses, and they pay their expenses with a mixture of [[Subscription business model|subscription]] revenue, [[newsagent's shop|newsstand sales]], and advertising revenue (other businesses or individuals pay to place advertisements in the pages, including [[newspaper display advertising|display ads]], [[classified advertising|classified ads]], and [[online advertising|their online equivalents]]). Some newspapers are government-run or at least government-funded; their reliance on advertising revenue and on profitability is less critical to their survival. The [[editorial independence]] of a newspaper is thus always subject to the [[wikt:interest|interests]] of someone, whether owners, advertisers, or a government. Some newspapers with high editorial independence, high journalism quality, and large circulation are viewed as [[newspaper of record|newspapers of record]].\n\nMany newspapers, besides employing journalists on their own payrolls, also subscribe to [[news agency|news agencies]] (wire services) (such as the [[Associated Press]], [[Reuters]], or [[Agence France-Presse]]), which employ journalists to find, assemble, and report the news, then sell the [[content (media)|content]] to the various newspapers. This is a way to avoid duplicating the expense of reporting from around the world. Circa 2005, there were approximately 6,580 daily newspaper titles in the world selling 395 million print copies a day (in the U.S., 1,450 titles selling 55&nbsp;million copies).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nieworld.com/cc/NewspaperADailyMiracle.pdf|title=''A Daily Miracle: A student guide to journalism and the newspaper business'' (2007)|date=|accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref> The [[Great Recession|late 2000s\u2013early 2010s global recession]], combined with the rapid growth of free web-based alternatives, has helped cause a decline in advertising and circulation, as many papers had to retrench operations to stanch the losses.<ref>{{cite news|author=Plambeck, Joseph|title=Newspaper Circulation Falls Nearly 9%|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/media/27audit.html?scp=3&sq=newspapers&st=Search|newspaper=The New York Times|date=26 April 2010}}</ref> Worldwide annual revenue approached $100&nbsp;billion in 2005-7, then plunged during the worldwide financial crisis of 2008-9.

Besides remodeling advertising, the internet (especially the [[World Wide Web|web]]) has also challenged the business models of the print-only era by [[crowdsourcing]] both publishing in general (sharing information with others) and, more specifically, [[journalism]] (the work of finding, assembling, and reporting the news). In addition, the rise of [[news aggregator]]s, which bundle linked articles from many online newspapers and other sources, influences the flow of [[web traffic]]. Increasing [[paywall]]ing of online newspapers may be counteracting those effects. The oldest newspaper still published is the '''''[[Ordinari Post Tijdender]]''''', which was established in [[Stockholm]] in 1645.\n\n===Definitions===\nNewspapers typically meet four criteria:<ref>Werner Faulstich: \"Grundwissen Medien\", 4th ed., ya UTB, 2000, {{ISBN|978-3-8252-8169-4}}, chapter 4</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rehm|first=Margarete|url=http://www.ib.hu-berlin.de/~wumsta/infopub/textbook/umfeld/rehm5.html|title=Margarete Rehm: Information und Kommunikaegenwart.

While online newspapers have increased access to newspapers by people with Internet access, people without Internet or computer access (e.g., [[homelessness|homeless people]], [[poverty|impoverished people]] and people living in remote or rural regions may [[Digital divide|not be able to access the Internet]], and thus will not be able to read online news). [[Literacy]] is also a factor which prevents [[Illiteracy|people who cannot read]] from being able to benefit from reading newspapers (paper or online).\n* [[Frequency|Periodicity]]: They are published at regular intervals, typically daily or weekly. This ensures that newspapers can provide information on newly-emerging news stories or events.\n* Currency: Its information is as up to date as its publication schedule allows. The degree of up-to-date-ness of a print newspaper is limited by the need of time to print and distribute the newspaper. In major cities, there may be a morning edition and a later edition of the same day's paper, so that the later edition can incorporate [[breaking news]] that have occurred since the morning edition was printed. Online newspapers can be updated as frequently as new information becomes available, even a number of times per day, which means that online editions can be very up-to-date.\n* Universality: Newspapers covers a range of topics, from political and business news to updates on science and technology, arts, culture, and entertainment.\n\n==History==\n\n===Gazettes and bulletins===\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], ''[[Acta Diurna]]'', or government announcement bulletins, were produced. They were carved in metal or stone and posted in public places. In China, early government-produced news-sheets, called [[Dibao (ancient Chinese Gazette)|Dibao]], circulated among court officials during the late [[Han dynasty]] (second and third centuries AD). Between 713 and 734, the ''[[Kaiyuan Za Bao]]'' (\"Bulletin of the Court\") of the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]] published government news; it was handwritten on silk and read by government officials.

More specialist still are some weekly newspapers, usually free and distributed within limited regional areas; these may serve communities as specific as certain immigrant populations, the local [[gay]] community or [[indie rock]] enthusiasts within a city or region.\n\n===Frequency===\n\n====Daily====\nA '''daily newspaper''' is printed every day, sometimes with the exception of Sundays and occasionally Saturdays, (and some major holidays)<ref>Example of Monday to Friday-only publishing: the London [[Evening Standard]], once a paid newspaper, now free-of-charge, aimed largely at commuters, does not publish on Saturdays</ref> and often of some [[List of holidays by country|national holidays]]. Saturday and, where they exist, Sunday editions of daily newspapers tend to be larger, include more specialized sections (e.g., on arts, films, entertainment) and advertising inserts, and cost more. Typically, the majority of these newspapers' staff members work Monday to Friday, so the Sunday and Monday editions largely depend on content done in advance or content that is syndicated. Most daily newspapers are sold in the morning.\n\nAfternoon or evening papers, once common but now scarce, are aimed more at commuters and office workers. In practice (though this may vary according to country), a morning newspaper is available in early editions from before midnight on the night before its [[cover date]], further editions being printed and distributed during the night. The later editions can include [[breaking news]] which was first revealed that day, after the morning edition was already printed.

In the past there were independent Sunday newspapers; nowadays the same publisher often produces a [[Sunday newspaper]], distinct in many ways from the daily, usually with a related name; e.g., ''[[The Times]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' are distinct newspapers owned by the same company, and an article published in the latter would never be credited to ''The Times''.\n\nIn some cases a Sunday edition is an expanded version of a newspaper from the same publisher; in other cases, particularly in Britain, it may be a separate enterprise, e.g., ''[[The Observer]]'', not affiliated with a daily newspaper from its founding in 1791 until it was acquired by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1993. Usually, it is a specially expanded edition, often several times the thickness and weight of the weekday editions and contain generally special sections not found in the weekday editions, such as [[Sunday comics]], Sunday magazines (such as ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and ''[[The Sunday Times Magazine]]'').\n\nIn some countries daily newspapers are not published on [[Christmas Day]], but weekly newspapers would change their day e.g. Sunday newspapers are published on Saturday December 24, [[Christmas Eve]] when [[Christmas Day]] is falling on Sunday.\n\n====Weekly and other====\n{{main|Weekly newspaper}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 133-075, Worms, Antisemitische Presse, \"St\u00fcrmerkasten\".jpg|thumb|Public reading of the anti-Semitic weekly newspaper ''[[Der St\u00fcrmer]]'', [[Worms, Germany]], 1935]]\n[[Weekly newspaper]]s are published once a week, and tend to be smaller than daily papers.

Some, such as ''[[The New York Times International Edition]]'', (formerly The International Herald Tribune) have always had that focus, while others are repackaged national newspapers or \"international editions\" of national or large metropolitan newspapers. In some cases, articles that might not interest the wider range of readers are omitted from international editions; in others, of interest to [[expatriates]], significant national news is retained. As English became the international language of business and technology, many newspapers formerly published only in non-English languages have also developed English-language editions. In places as varied as [[Jerusalem]] and [[Mumbai]], newspapers are printed for a local and international English-speaking public, and for tourists. The advent of the Internet has also allowed non-English-language newspapers to put out a scaled-down English version to give their newspaper a global outreach.\n\nSimilarly, in many countries with a large foreign-language-speaking population or many tourists, newspapers in languages other than the national language are both published locally and imported. For example, newspapers and magazines from many countries, and [[List of newspapers in the United Kingdom#Non-English-language newspapers|locally published newspapers in many languages]], are readily to be found on news-stands in central London. In the US state of [[Florida]], so many tourists from the French-speaking Canadian province of [[Quebec]] visit for long stays during the winter (\"[[snowbird (person)|snowbirds]]\") that some newsstands and stores sell French-language newspapers such as ''[[Le Droit]]''.\n\n===Subject matter===\nGeneral newspapers cover all topics, with different emphasis. While at least mentioning all topics, some might have good coverage of international events of importance; others might concentrate more on national or local entertainment or sports. Specialised newspapers might concentrate more specifically on, for example, financial matters. There are publications covering exclusively sports, or certain sports, horse-racing, theatre, and so on, although they may no longer be called newspapers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n===Technology===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-85461-0005, Berlin, Mauerbau, NVA-Panzersoldaten.jpg|thumb|upright|Soldiers in an [[East Germany|East German]] tank unit reading about the erection of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961 in the newspaper [[Neues Deutschland]]]]\n\n====Print====\nFor centuries newspapers were printed on paper and supplied physically to readers either by local distribution, or in some cases by mail, for example for British expatriates living in India or Hong Kong who subscribed to British newspapers. Newspapers can be delivered to subscribers homes and/or businesses by a paper's own delivery people, sent via the [[mail]], sold at [[newsstand]]s, [[grocery store]]s and [[convenience store]]s, and delivered to [[library|libraries]] and [[bookstore]]s. Newspaper organizations need a large distribution system to deliver their papers to these different distributors, which typically involves delivery trucks and delivery people.\nIn recent years, newspapers and other media have adapted to the changing technology environment by starting to offer online editions to cater to the needs of the public. In the future, the trend towards more electronic delivery of the news will continue with more emphasis on the Internet, social media and other electronic delivery methods. However, while the method of delivery is changing, the newspaper and the industry still has a niche in the world.\n\n====Online====\n{{Main|Online newspaper}}\nAs of 2007, virtually all major printed newspapers have online editions distributed over the Internet which, depending on the country may be regulated by journalism organizations such as the [[Press Complaints Commission]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story3152.shtml|title=Journalism Magazine|publisher=Journalism.co.uk|date=19 January 2007|accessdate=21 February 2012}}</ref> But as some publishers find their print-based models increasingly unsustainable,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2017/jan/24/winning-back-advertisers-is-key-to-saving-the-newspaper-industry|title=Guardian News and Media Limited|publisher=theguardian.com|date=24 January 2017|accessdate=24 January 2017}}</ref> Web-based \"newspapers\" have also started to appear, such as the ''[[Southport Reporter]]'' in the UK and the ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'', which stopped publishing in print after 149 years in March 2009 and became an online-only paper.\n\nSince 2005 in the UK more than 200 regional newspapers have closed down resulting in 50% decline in the number of regional journalists. A 2016 study done by King's College London found that the towns which lost their local newspapers receded from the democratic values and experienced the loss of public faith in the authorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-43106436|title=The death of the local newspaper?|last=|first=|date=20 February 2018|website=BBC|access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nA new trend in newspaper publishing is the introduction of [[personalization]] through [[on-demand printing]] technologies or with online news aggregator websites like [[Google news]]. Customized newspapers allow the reader to create their individual newspaper through the selection of individual pages from multiple publications. This \"Best of\" approach allows revival of the print-based model and opens up a new distribution channel to increase coverage beneath the usual boundaries of distribution. Customized newspapers online have been offered by MyYahoo, I-Google, CRAYON, ICurrent.com, Kibboko.com, Twitter. times and many others. With these online newspapers, the reader can select how much of each section (politics, sports, arts, etc.) they wish to see in their news.\n\n==Organization and personnel==\n[[File:Gazeta Lubuska newsroom.jpg|thumb|left|The newsroom of Gazeta Lubuska in [[Zielona G\u00f3ra]], Poland]]\nIn the United States, the overall manager or chief executive of the newspaper is the publisher.<ref>{{cite web|title=Career Guide to Industries, 2010\u201311 Edition: Publishing, Except Software|url=http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/cgs013.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of Labor|author=Bureau of Labor Statistics|date=17 December 2009|accessdate=28 May 2010}}</ref> In small newspapers, the owner of the publication (or the largest shareholder in the corporation that owns the publication) is usually the publisher. Although he or she rarely or perhaps never writes stories, the publisher is legally responsible for the contents of the entire newspaper and also runs the business, including hiring editors, reporters, and other staff members. This title is less common outside the U.S. The equivalent position in the film industry and television news shows is the executive producer.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} Most newspapers have four main departments devoted to publishing the newspaper itself\u2014editorial, production/printing, circulation, and advertising, although they are frequently referred to by a variety of other names\u2014as well as the non-newspaper-specific departments also found in other businesses of comparable size, such as accounting, marketing, human resources, and IT.\n\nThroughout the English-speaking world, the person who selects the content for the newspaper is usually referred to as the editor. Variations on this title such as editor-in-chief, executive editor, and so on are common. For small newspapers, a single editor may be responsible for all content areas. At large newspapers, the most senior editor is in overall charge of the publication, while less senior editors may each focus on one subject area, such as local news or sports. These divisions are called [[news bureau]]s or \"desks\", and each is supervised by a designated editor. Most newspaper editors [[copy edit]] the stories for their part of the newspaper, but they may share their workload with [[proofreader]]s and [[fact checker]]s.\n[[File:Newsboy in 1905.jpg|thumb|A [[Newspaper delivery|newsboy]] in 1905 selling the ''[[Toronto Telegram]]'' in Canada]]\n\n[[Reporter]]s are journalists who primarily report facts that they have gathered and those who write longer, less news-oriented articles may be called feature writers. Photographers and [[graphic artist]]s provide images and illustrations to support articles. Journalists often specialize in a subject area, called a [[Beat reporting|beat]], such as sports, religion, or science. Columnists are journalists who write regular articles recounting their personal opinions and experiences. [[Printer (publishing)|Printers]] and press operators physically print the newspaper. Printing is outsourced by many newspapers, partly because of the cost of an [[Offset printing|offset web press]] (the most common kind of press used to print newspapers) and also because a small newspaper's [[print run]] might require less than an hour of operation, meaning that if the newspaper had its own press it would sit idle most of the time. If the newspaper offers information online, [[webmaster]]s and [[web designer]]s may be employed to upload stories to the newspaper's website.\n\nThe staff of the [[Newspaper circulation|circulation department]] liaise with retailers who sell the newspaper; sell subscriptions; and supervise distribution of the printed newspapers through the mail, by [[newspaper carrier]]s, at retailers, and through vending machines. [[Free newspapers]] do not sell subscriptions, but they still have a circulation department responsible for distributing the newspapers. Sales staff in the advertising department not only sell ad space to clients such as local businesses, but also help clients design and plan their advertising campaigns. Other members of the advertising department may include [[graphic designer]]s, who design ads according to the customers' specifications and the department's policies. In an [[Advertising-free media|advertising-free newspaper]], there is no advertising department.\n\n==Zoned and other editions==\n[[File:Newspapers.jpg|thumb|Israeli daily newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', seen in its [[Hebrew]] and English language editions]]\nNewspapers often refine distribution of ads and news through zoning and editioning. Zoning occurs when advertising and editorial content change to reflect the location to which the product is delivered. The editorial content often may change merely to reflect changes in advertising\u2014the quantity and layout of which affects the space available for editorial\u2014or may contain region-specific news. In rare instances, the advertising may not change from one zone to another, but there will be different region-specific editorial content. As the content can vary widely, zoned editions are often produced in parallel. Editioning occurs in the main sections as news is updated throughout the night. The advertising is usually the same in each edition (with the exception of zoned regionals, in which it is often the 'B' section of local news that undergoes advertising changes). As each edition represents the latest news available for the next press run, these editions are produced linearly, with one completed edition being copied and updated for the next edition. The previous edition is always copied to maintain a Newspaper of Record and to fall back on if a quick correction is needed for the press. For example, both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' offer a regional edition, printed through a local contractor, and featuring locale specific content. The Journal's global advertising [[rate card]] provides a good example of editioning.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |title=WSJ Advertising: Rates |publisher=Advertising.wsj.com |accessdate=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029083017/http://advertising.wsj.com/rates/index.html |archivedate=29 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n''See also [[Los Angeles Times suburban sections]].''\n\n==Format==\n[[File:Newspapers of Japan 20090831.jpg|thumb|[[Yomiuri Shimbun]], a broadsheet in Japan credited with having the largest newspaper circulation in the world]]\nMost modern newspapers<ref>See K.G.

Since the 1980s, the newspaper industry has largely moved away from lower-quality [[letterpress printing]] to higher-quality, [[CMYK color model|four-color process]], [[offset printing]]. In addition, desktop computers, [[word processor|word processing software]], [[graphics software]], [[digital camera]]s and digital [[prepress]] and [[typesetting]] technologies have revolutionized the newspaper production process. These technologies have enabled newspapers to publish color photographs and graphics, as well as innovative [[Page layout|layouts]] and better design.\n\nTo help their titles stand out on newsstands, some newspapers are printed on coloured newsprint. For example, the ''[[Financial Times]]'' is printed on a distinctive salmon pink paper, and [[Sheffield]]'s weekly sports publication derives its name, the ''[[Green Un|Green 'Un]]'', from the traditional colour of its paper. The Italian sports newspaper ''[[La Gazzetta dello Sport]]'' is also printed on pink paper while ''[[L'\u00c9quipe]]'' (formerly ''L'Auto'') is printed on yellow paper. Both the latter promoted major cycling races and their newsprint colours were reflected in the colours of the jerseys used to denote the race leader; for example the leader in the [[Giro d'Italia]] wears a pink jersey.\n\n==Circulation and readership==\n{{Main|List of newspapers in the World by circulation|Newspaper circulation|Ageing of newspaper readership}}\n[[File:Newspaper vendor.jpg|thumb|left|Newspaper vendor, [[Paddington]], London, February 2005]]\nThe number of copies distributed, either on an average day or on particular days (typically Sunday), is called the newspaper's circulation and is one of the principal factors used to set advertising rates. Circulation is not necessarily the same as copies sold, since some copies or newspapers are distributed without cost. Readership figures may be higher than circulation figures because many copies are read by more than one person, although this is offset by the number of copies distributed but not read (especially for those distributed free). In the United States, the [[Alliance for Audited Media]] maintains historical and current data on average circulation of daily and weekly newspapers and other periodicals.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'', the daily circulation of the Soviet newspaper ''[[Trud (Russian newspaper)|Trud]]'' exceeded 21,500,000 in 1990, while the Soviet weekly ''[[Argumenty i Fakty]]'' boasted a circulation of 33,500,000 in 1991. According to United Nations data from 1995 Japan has three daily papers\u2014the ''[[Yomiuri Shimbun]]'', ''[[Asahi Shimbun]]'', and ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]''\u2014with circulations well above 5.5&nbsp;million. Germany's ''[[Bild-Zeitung|Bild]]'', with a circulation of 3.8&nbsp;million, was the only other paper in that category. In the United Kingdom, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' is the top seller, with around 3.24&nbsp;million copies distributed daily. In the U.S., ''The Wall Street Journal'' has a daily circulation of approximately 2.02&nbsp;million, making it the most widely distributed paper in the country.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2010138873_apusnewspapercirculation.html|title=Newspaper circulation drop accelerates April\u2013Sept|author=Liedtke, Michael|newspaper=The Seattle Times|date=26 October 2009|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nWhile paid readership of print newspapers has been steadily declining in the developed [[OECD]] nations, it has been rising in the chief developing nations (Brazil, India, Indonesia, China and South Africa), whose paid daily circulation exceeded those of the developed nations for the first time in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/30/24/45559596.pdf|title=The evolution of news and the internet|author=OECD Working Party on the Information Economy|date=11 June 2010|accessdate=14 July 2011}}\"Growth in the BIICS countries by about 35% from 2000 to 2008 very much contributed to this growth, most notably India with a 45% increase in circulation between 2000 and 2008, South Africa (34%) and China (an estimated 29%).

As other media began to compete with newspapers, and as printing became easier and less expensive giving rise to a greater diversity of publications, market penetration began to decline. It wasn't until the early 1970s, however, that market penetration dipped below 100 percent.

For example, someone might want only a Sunday paper, or perhaps only Sunday and Saturday, or maybe only a [[workweek]] subscription, or perhaps a daily subscription. Most newspapers provide some or all of their content on the Internet, either at no cost or for a fee. In some cases, free access is available only for a matter of days or weeks, or for a certain number of viewed articles, after which readers must register and provide personal data. In other cases, free archives are provided.\n\n==Advertising==\n[[File:C & A Speciale Mantel-Aanbieding.jpg|thumb|1938 Dutch newspaper advertisement for women's clothing sold at [[C&A]] stores]]\nA newspaper typically generates 70\u201380% of its revenue from advertising, and the remainder from sales and subscriptions.<ref name=\"business_model_1996\">{{cite news\n|url=https://www.academia.edu/4894990\n|title=Online Revenue Business Model Has Changed Little Since 1996|publisher=[[Newspaper Research Journal]]|author=Mensing, Donica|date=Spring 2007}}</ref> The portion of the newspaper that is not advertising is called ''editorial content'', ''editorial matter'', or simply ''editorial'', although the last term is also used to refer specifically to those articles in which the newspaper and its guest writers express their opinions.

The [[business model]] of having advertising subsidize the cost of printing and distributing newspapers (and, it is always hoped, the making of a profit) rather than having subscribers cover the full cost was first done, it seems, in 1833 by ''[[The Sun (New York)|The Sun]]'', a daily paper that was published in New York City. Rather than charging 6 cents per copy, the price of a typical New York daily at the time, they charged 1-cent, and depended on advertising to make up the difference.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18904178|title=Reinventing the newspaper|date=7 July 2011|accessdate=13 July 2011|work=The Economist}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Naa newspaper ad revenue.svg|thumb|US Newspaper Advertising Revenue -  ''Newspaper Association of America published data''<ref name=NAAdata>{{cite web|title=Trends & Numbers |date=14 March 2012 |publisher=[[Newspaper Association of America]] |accessdate=18 September 2012 |url=http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918094825/http://www.naa.org/Trends-and-Numbers/Advertising-Expenditures/Annual-All-Categories.aspx |archivedate=18 September 2012 }}</ref>]]\n\nNewspapers in countries with easy access to the [[World Wide Web|web]] have been hurt by the decline of many traditional advertisers.

The classified category is shifting to sites including [[Craigslist]], employment websites, and auto sites. National advertisers are shifting to many types of digital content including websites, rich media platforms, and mobile.\n\nIn recent years, the [[advertorial]] emerged. Advertorials are most commonly recognized as an [[Editorial|opposite-editorial]] which third parties pay a fee to have included in the paper. [[Advertorial]]s commonly advertise new products or techniques, such as a new design for golf equipment, a new form of laser surgery, or weight-loss drugs. The tone is usually closer to that of a [[press release]] than of an objective [[news story]]. Such articles are often clearly distinguished from editorial content through either the design and layout of the page or with a label declaring the article as an advertisement. However, there has been growing concern over the blurring of the line between editorial and advertorial content.<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/may/16/blurring-lines-between-advertising-and-editorial|title = Dangerous blend: how lines between editorial and advertising are blurring|last = Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|first = Filloux|date = 16 May 2011|work = The Guardian|accessdate = 5 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Journalism==\n{{Main|Journalism}}\n[[File:Severnyi krai.jpg|thumb|The editorial staff of newspaper \"Severnyi Kray\" in [[Yaroslavl]], Russia in 1900]]\nSince newspapers began as a journal (record of current events), the profession involved in the making of newspapers began to be called ''journalism''. In the [[yellow journalism]] era of the 19th century, many newspapers in the United States relied on sensational stories that were meant to anger or excite the public, rather than to inform. The restrained style of reporting that relies on fact checking and accuracy regained popularity around [[World War II]]. Criticism of journalism is varied and sometimes vehement. Credibility is questioned because of anonymous sources; errors in facts, spelling, and grammar; real or perceived [[bias]]; and scandals involving [[plagiarism]] and fabrication.\n\nIn the past, newspapers have often been owned by so-called [[press baron]]s, and were used for gaining a political voice. After 1920 most major newspapers became parts of chains run by large media corporations such as [[Gannett]], [[The McClatchy Company]], [[Hearst Corporation]], [[Cox Enterprises]], [[Landmark Media Enterprises LLC]], [[Morris Communications]], [[Tribune Company|The Tribune Company]], [[Hollinger Inc.|Hollinger International]], [[News Corporation (1980\u20132013)|News Corporation]], [[Swift Communications]], etc. Newspapers have, in the modern world, played an important role in the exercise of freedom of expression. Whistle-blowers, and those who \"leak\" stories of corruption in political circles often choose to inform newspapers before other mediums of communication, relying on the perceived willingness of newspaper editors to expose the secrets and lies of those who would rather cover them. However, there have been many circumstances of the political autonomy of newspapers being curtailed. Recent research has examined the effects of a newspaper's closing on the reelection of incumbents, voter turnout, and campaign spending.<ref>[https://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/wp/wp686.pdf Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, ''Do Newspapers Matter?'', 2011]</ref>\n\nOpinions of other writers and readers are expressed in the ''[[op-ed]]'' (\"opposite the editorial page\") and [[letter to the editor|''letters to the editors'']] sections of the paper. Some ways newspapers have tried to improve their credibility are: appointing [[ombudsman|ombudsmen]], developing ethics policies and training, using more stringent corrections policies, communicating their processes and rationale with readers, and asking sources to review articles after publication.\n\n==Impact of television and Internet==\n{{Main|Decline of newspapers}}\n{{Further|Online newspapers}}\n[[File:2010 newspaper press France 5125942563.jpg|thumb|upright|Newspaper press in [[Limoges]], France]]\nBy the late 1990s, the availability of news via 24-hour television channels and the subsequent availability of [[online journalism]] posed an ongoing challenge to the business model of most newspapers in developed countries. Paid [[newspaper circulation]] has declined, while advertising revenue\u2014the bulk of most newspapers' income\u2014has been shifting from print to [[social media]] and news websites, resulting in a general decline. One of the challenges is that a number of online news websites are free to access. Other online news sites have a [[paywall]] and require paid subscription for access. In less-developed countries, cheaper printing and distribution, increased literacy, a growing middle class, and other factors have compensated for the emergence of electronic media, and newspaper circulation continues to grow.<ref>N.

Since the late-1990s, the number of newspapers slated for closure, bankruptcy, or severe cutbacks has risen\u2014especially in the United States, where the industry has shed a fifth of its journalists since 2001.<ref name=\"E&P0316\">{{cite news|url = http://www.editorandpublisher.com/PrintArticle/Specifics-on-Newspapers-from-State-of-News-Media-Report|title = Specifics on Newspapers from 'State of News Media' Report|first = Jennifer|last = Saba|work = [[Editor & Publisher]]|date = 16 March 2009|accessdate = 17 March 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe debate has become more urgent lately, as the 2008\u20132009 recession shaved newspapers' profits and as once-explosive growth in web revenue has leveled off, forestalling what the industry hoped would become an important source of revenue.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/13/business/media/13adco.html?src=linkedin|title=Newspapers' Web Revenue is Stalling|newspaper=The New York Times|date=12 October 2008| first=Stephanie|last=Clifford|accessdate=10 April 2010}}</ref> At issue is whether the newspaper industry faces a [[Business cycle|cyclical]] trough (or dip), or whether new technology has rendered print newspapers obsolete.  {{As of|2017}}, an increasing percentage of [[millennial]]s get their news from social media websites. In the 2010s, many traditional newspapers have begun offering \"digital editions,\" accessible via computers and mobile devices.
