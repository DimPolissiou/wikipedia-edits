The borough borders the Borough of [[Crawley]] (in [[West Sussex]]) to the south, the Borough of [[Epsom and Ewell]] and District of [[Mole Valley]] to the west, [[Tandridge District]] to the east and the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]] and [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]] to the north.\n\n==History of Local Authority and Politics==\nThe district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], by a merger of the Municipal Borough of Reigate with Banstead [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]] and part of Dorking and Horley Rural District. There are two [[Civil parishes in England|civil parishes]] towards the south the borough: [[Salfords and Sidlow]] and [[Horley]].<ref>[http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Parishes+by+district Surrey County Council]</ref> The remainder of the area has two rather than three tiers of local government; the next tier up is [[Surrey County Council]].\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main| Reigate and Banstead Borough Council elections}}\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe [[coat of arms]] is a combination of the elements of the Reigate shield, the device of Banstead and symbols of the parishes of Horley and Salfords and Sidlow.<ref name=\"Mayor\">{{cite web|title=Role of the Mayor|url=http://www.reigate-banstead.gov.uk/info/20322/mayor/551/role_of_the_mayor|publisher=Reigate & Banstead Council|accessdate=29 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Shield (heraldry)|shield]] has a background of blue and yellow chequers taken from the arms of the de Warenne family. [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey|William de Warenne]] accompanied William the Conqueror from Normandy and was the first [[Earl of Surrey]] and the builder of [[Reigate Castle]]. Against this pattern is the Reigate Castle Gate and [[oak]] tree.<ref name=\"Mayor\"/>\n\nThe top of the shield has a black background as in the original Reigate arms but on which is a gold woolpack between two sprigs of oak. The woolpack or woolsack refers to the former importance of sheep rearing and wool production in Banstead. The oak sprigs represent the two parishes of Horley and Salfords and Sidlow.<ref name=\"Mayor\"/>\n\nAbove the shield is a [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] with a wreath and draped cloth also in the blue and gold of the de Warennes. On top of the helmet is a pilgrim referring to the ancient route along the escarpment of the [[North Downs]] by Banstead and Reigate, the [[Pilgrims Way]].<ref name=\"Mayor\"/>\n\nOn either side of the shield is a white lion and a white horse. The lion comes from the arms of the de Mowbray family who were briefly Lords of the Manor of Banstead in the 12th century. The horse refers to the tradition of horse racing on [[Banstead Downs]] in the 17th century and immortalised in the [[Epsom Oaks|Oaks]] race of [[Epsom Derby]] Friday. On the necks of the animals are wreaths again in the blue and yellow. On the shoulders are roundels of blue and white waves indicating the [[River Mole]] in Horley and Sidlow.<ref name=\"Mayor\"/>\n\nThe roundel on the lion has a tanner\u2019s (or flaying) knife, the emblem of [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St Bartholomew]], the patron of Horley, who is said to have been flayed or skinned before he was crucified. The roundel on the shoulder of the horse has a [[Willow|sallow]] leaf, a reference to Salfords, which is derived from Sallow Ford. The Sallow tree is commonly known as Pussy Willow.<ref name=\"Mayor\"/>\n\nThe motto \"Never Wonne ne never shall\" is taken from an ancient couplet and refers to the defeat of the Danes by King [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]] in a battle in the Vale of Holmesdale in the 9th century, now remembered in the name Battlebridge. Reigate Castle has also been known as Holmesdale Castle. A translation is \"Never conquered nor never shall\".<ref name=\"Mayor\"/>\n\n==Settlements within the Borough==\n:<small>''Grouped by conurbation clockwise from the north:''</small>\n* [[Banstead]], [[Burgh Heath]] and [[Nork, Surrey|Nork]] \n* [[Kingswood, Surrey|Kingswood]] including [[Lower Kingswood]]\n* [[Chipstead, Surrey|Chipstead]] and [[Woodmansterne|Woodmansterne Park]]\n* [[Hooley]] and [[Netherne-on-the-Hill]]\n* [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], [[Earlswood]], [[Meadvale]] and [[Merstham]]\n* [[Whitebushes|Whitebushes/South Earlswood]]<ref name=osm>[http://www.openstreetmap.org Open Street Map]</ref> and [[Salfords]] \n* [[Horley]]\n* [[Sidlow]]\n* [[Reigate]], [[Gatton, Surrey|Gatton]], [[Reigate#South Park|South Park]], [[Reigate|Flanchford/Skimmington/Wonham Mill]] (hamlets) and [[Woodhatch]]\n* [[Walton-on-the-Hill]] and [[Mogador, Surrey|Mogador]]/[[Margery]] (hamlets)\n* [[Tadworth]], [[Tattenham Corner|The Tattenhams (Tattenham Grove, Heath & Corner)]]\n* [[Epsom|Epsom Downs (part of)]] <small>''The developed part of Epsom Downs is not in [[Epsom and Ewell]] and is near [[Epsom Downs railway station]]''</small><ref>[http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/maps/surrey-interactive-map Surrey Interactive Map, Fir Tree Road, Epsom]</ref>\n\n==Elevations, Landscape and Wildlife==\nThe northern third of the borough is on the [[North Downs]] or its upper slopes.  Commanding viewpoints exist in several locations in this area with the southern aspects of [[Colley Hill]] and [[Reigate|Reigate Hill]] noteworthy enough to have had a major memorial and a picnic area with large caf\u00e9 respectively.  Historically much of this third was named ''Walton Heath'' and ''Banstead Heath''. For tourists, [[Box Hill, Surrey|Box Hill]] on the southern ridge with its visitor centre and greater than 180 degree viewpoint over the [[River Mole]] attracts higher numbers less than {{convert|3|mi|0}} west along the [[Pilgrims' Way]] in [[Mole Valley]].\n\nThe softer [[Greensand Ridge]] which is parallel to the south breaks up in the middle of the borough, forming the [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] basin and various mounds around [[Reigate]] before continuing in both directions at higher elevations, see the [[Greensand Way]].<ref>[http://gridreferencefinder.com Grid Reference Finder, Elevation Tools]</ref>  The [[River Mole|Mole]] forms a section of the western border of the borough down to Wonham Mill at the western extreme of Flanchford in the Reigate [[post town]], itself at a millpond at the foot of the wooded ''Snag Brook'' a tributary which rises near the [[A25 road|A25 Dorking Road]].<ref name=osm/>  Most of the county is [[Metropolitan Green Belt]].\n\nThere are significant areas of forest and heath management, including five reserves within the national wildlife trust scheme: see [[Surrey Wildlife Trust]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy is diverse, with a strong local service sector, [[City of London|city workers]] as most locations are easily within the [[London Commuter Belt]], trades, a developed public/education sector and several farms concentrated towards [[crop|cereal and root vegetable]] [[agriculture]].  There is an extent of [[woodland]] [[forestry|management]].

[[Non-metropolitan district|local government district]] with [[borough]] status in east [[Surrey]], [[England]].{{#tag:ref|The areas were historically in South East Surrey before the 1965 changes under the [[London Government Act 1963]]|group= n}} It includes the towns of [[Reigate, Surrey|Reigate]], [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], [[Horley]] and [[Banstead]]. The borough borders the Borough of [[Crawley]] (in [[West Sussex]]) to the south, the Borough of [[Epsom and Ewell]] and District of [[Mole Valley]] to the west, [[Tandridge District]] to the east and the London Boroughs of [[London Borough of Sutton|Sutton]] and [[London Borough of Croydon|Croydon]] to the north.\n\n==History of Local Authority and Politics==\nThe district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the [[Local Government Act 1972]], by a merger of the Municipal Borough of Reigate with Banstead [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|Urban District]] and part of Dorking and Horley Rural District. There are two [[Civil parishes in England|civil parishes]] towards the south the borough: [[Salfords and Sidlow]] and [[Horley]].<ref>[http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/sccwebsite/sccwspages.nsf/LookupWebPagesByTITLE_RTF/Parishes+by+district Surrey County Council]</ref> The remainder of the area has two rather than three tiers of local government; the next tier up is [[Surrey County Council]].\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main| Reigate and Banstead Borough Council elections}}\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe [[coat of arms]] is a combination of the elements of the Reigate shield, the device of Banstead and symbols of the parishes of Horley and Salfords and Sidlow.<ref name=\"Mayor\">{{cite web|title=Role of the Mayor|url=http://www.reigate-banstead.gov.uk/info/20322/mayor/551/role_of_the_mayor|publisher=Reigate & Banstead Council|accessdate=29 December 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Shield (heraldry)|shield]] has a background of blue and yellow chequers taken from the arms of the de Warenne family. [[William de Warenne, 1st Earl of Surrey|William de Warenne]] accompanied William the Conqueror from Normandy and was the first [[Earl of Surrey]] and the builder of [[Reigate Castle]]. Against this pattern is the Reigate Castle Gate and [[oak]] tree.<ref name=\"Mayor\"/>\n\nThe top of the shield has a black background as in the original Reigate arms but on which is a gold woolpack between two sprigs of oak. The woolpack or woolsack refers to the former importance of sheep rearing and wool production in Banstead. The oak sprigs represent the two parishes of Horley and Salfords and Sidlow.<ref name=\"Mayor\"/>\n\nAbove the shield is a [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] with a wreath and draped cloth also in the blue and gold of the de Warennes. On top of the helmet is a pilgrim referring to the ancient route along the escarpment of the [[North Downs]] by Banstead and Reigate, the [[Pilgrims Way]].<ref name=\"Mayor\"/>\n\nOn either side of the shield is a white lion and a white horse. The lion comes from the arms of the de Mowbray family who were briefly Lords of the Manor of Banstead in the 12th century. The horse refers to the tradition of horse racing on [[Banstead Downs]] in the 17th century and immortalised in the [[Epsom Oaks|Oaks]] race of [[Epsom Derby]] Friday. On the necks of the animals are wreaths again in the blue and yellow. On the shoulders are roundels of blue and white waves indicating the [[River Mole]] in Horley and Sidlow.<ref name=\"Mayor\"/>\n\nThe roundel on the lion has a tanner\u2019s (or flaying) knife, the emblem of [[Bartholomew the Apostle|St Bartholomew]], the patron of Horley, who is said to have been flayed or skinned before he was crucified. The roundel on the shoulder of the horse has a [[Willow|sallow]] leaf, a reference to Salfords, which is derived from Sallow Ford. The Sallow tree is commonly known as Pussy Willow.<ref name=\"Mayor\"/>\n\nThe motto \"Never Wonne ne never shall\" is taken from an ancient couplet and refers to the defeat of the Danes by King [[Alfred the Great|Alfred]] in a battle in the Vale of Holmesdale in the 9th century, now remembered in the name Battlebridge. Reigate Castle has also been known as Holmesdale Castle. A translation is \"Never conquered nor never shall\".<ref name=\"Mayor\"/>\n\n==Settlements within the Borough==\n:<small>''Grouped by conurbation clockwise from the north:''</small>\n* [[Banstead]], [[Burgh Heath]] and [[Nork, Surrey|Nork]] \n* [[Kingswood, Surrey|Kingswood]] including [[Lower Kingswood]]\n* [[Chipstead, Surrey|Chipstead]] and [[Woodmansterne|Woodmansterne Park]]\n* [[Hooley]] and [[Netherne-on-the-Hill]]\n* [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]], [[Earlswood]], [[Meadvale]] and [[Merstham]]\n* [[Whitebushes|Whitebushes/South Earlswood]]<ref name=osm>[http://www.openstreetmap.org Open Street Map]</ref> and [[Salfords]] \n* [[Horley]]\n* [[Sidlow]]\n* [[Reigate]], [[Gatton, Surrey|Gatton]], [[Reigate#South Park|South Park]], [[Reigate|Flanchford/Skimmington/Wonham Mill]] (hamlets) and [[Woodhatch]]\n* [[Walton-on-the-Hill]] and [[Mogador, Surrey|Mogador]]/[[Margery]] (hamlets)\n* [[Tadworth]], [[Tattenham Corner|The Tattenhams (Tattenham Grove, Heath & Corner)]]\n* [[Epsom|Epsom Downs (part of)]] <small>''The developed part of Epsom Downs is not in [[Epsom and Ewell]] and is near [[Epsom Downs railway station]]''</small><ref>[http://www.surreycc.gov.uk/maps/surrey-interactive-map Surrey Interactive Map, Fir Tree Road, Epsom]</ref>\n\n==Elevations, Landscape and Wildlife==\nThe northern third of the borough is on the [[North Downs]] or its upper slopes.  Commanding viewpoints exist in several locations in this area with the southern aspects of [[Colley Hill]] and [[Reigate|Reigate Hill]] noteworthy enough to have had a major memorial and a picnic area with large caf\u00e9 respectively.  Historically much of this third was named ''Walton Heath'' and ''Banstead Heath''. For tourists, [[Box Hill, Surrey|Box Hill]] on the southern ridge with its visitor centre and greater than 180 degree viewpoint over the [[River Mole]] attracts higher numbers less than {{convert|3|mi|0}} west along the [[Pilgrims' Way]] in [[Mole Valley]].\n\nThe softer [[Greensand Ridge]] which is parallel to the south breaks up in the middle of the borough, forming the [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] basin and various mounds around [[Reigate]] before continuing in both directions at higher elevations, see the [[Greensand Way]].<ref>[http://gridreferencefinder.com Grid Reference Finder, Elevation Tools]</ref>  The [[River Mole|Mole]] forms a section of the western border of the borough down to Wonham Mill at the western extreme of Flanchford in the Reigate [[post town]], itself at a millpond at the foot of the wooded ''Snag Brook'' a tributary which rises near the [[A25 road|A25 Dorking Road]].<ref name=osm/>  Most of the county is [[Metropolitan Green Belt]].\n\nThere are significant areas of forest and heath management, including five reserves within the national wildlife trust scheme: see [[Surrey Wildlife Trust]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy is diverse, with a strong local service sector, [[City of London|city workers]] as most locations are easily within the [[London Commuter Belt]], trades, a developed public/education sector and several farms concentrated towards [[crop|cereal and root vegetable]] [[agriculture]].  There is an extent of [[woodland]] [[forestry|management]]. Several employers with an international renown are found in force in and around the two most commercial towns centres of Reigate and Redhill: including [[Towers Watson]], [[Kimberly Clark]], [[Legal & General]], [[Travelers Group]] (insurance), [[AXA Insurance]] breakdown, [[Black & Veatch]] and [[Esure]].
