Medical organizations have more than 40 thousand devices for artificial lung ventilation, 124 devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The government of the Russian Federation has allocated resources for the additional purchase of more than 500 devices, including 17 ECMO devices.

However, bed equipment varies from hospital to hospital. In terms of equipment \u2014 for example, CT and MRI devices \u2014 Russia is in 28th place with a dramatic gap from the leaders. [[Rosstat]] does not publish data on the number of places in intensive care units and equipment. In total, there are 1 million 172 thousand beds in Russian hospitals, according to Rosstat data for 2018. These include intensive care units. Intensive care bed means a bed equipped with a set of equipment for resuscitation and intensive care, including ventilators. The Institute of Phthisiopulmonology and infectious diseases of the Ministry of Health estimated the number of intensive care beds at just 12 thousand, which is three times less than the Ministry of Health's standard. The proekt.media website was able to find data on the number of intensive care beds in only 23 regions. Only Moscow, Kalmykia, Altai and Komi reached the standard of 3%. Other regions are significantly below the standard.<br/>Separate ventilators in hospitals should be more than intensive care beds. The number of ventilators in a region should be at least 1.5 times more than the number of intensive care beds. There are no official statistics on the number of ventilators. Federal authorities with the beginning of the epidemic conducted their own calculations: Deputy Prime Minister [[Tatyana Golikova]] said that Russia has 40 thousand ventilators. This is 3.4% of the total number of beds in Russia, and more than 12 thousand devices are missing from the standards of the Ministry of health. This is a total deficit of 23%, but in some regions it is much larger. The website asks, can we be sure that all the devices included in the statistics are in working order? 58% of ventilators are more than 9 years old. Components may require more frequent replacement. For example, the oxygen sensor of the American model common in Russia, [[Puritan Bennett]], is subject to replacement every two years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.proekt.media/research/koronavirus-regiony/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404095318/https://www.proekt.media/research/koronavirus-regiony/ |archive-date=4 April 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nData collected by the news website [[Meduza]] indicates that Russia's supply of ventilators is quite extensive: Even the number available per capita in some geographically peripheral regions, not to mention Moscow, significantly exceeds ventilator supplies in Western countries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/21/the-ventilator-problem |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326174233/https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/21/the-ventilator-problem |archive-date=26 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{{Collapse top}}\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| label_type  = REGION\n| data_type   = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| bar_width   = 50\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 57\n\n| label1   = \nKhanty-Mansi AO\n| data1    = \n56.8\n\n| label2   = \nSamara region\n| data2    = \n42.6\n\n| label3   = \nAmur region\n| data3    = \n42.5\n\n| label4   = \nMoscow (city)\n| data4    = \n40\n\n| label5   = \nKirov region\n| data5    = \n39.6\n\n| label6   = \nArkhangelsk region\n| data6    = \n38.4\n\n| label7   = \nSakha Republic (Yakutia)\n| data7    = \n37.2\n\n| label8   = \nSakhalin region\n| data8    = \n37.1\n\n| label9   = \nTomsk region\n| data9    = \n37.1\n\n| label10   = \nSt. Petersburg (city)\n| data10    = \n35.2\n\n| label11   = \nLipetsk region\n| data11    = \n35.1\n\n| label12   = \nSverdlovsk region\n| data12    = \n35\n\n| label13   = \nChuvash Republic (Chuvashia)\n| data13    = \n34.7\n\n| label14   = \nAltai Krai\n| data14    = \n34.6\n\n| label15   = \nRepublic of Crimea (status disputed)\n| data15    = \n34.3\n\n| label16   = \nRepublic of Karelia\n| data16    = \n32.5\n\n| label17   = \nYaroslavl region\n| data17    = \n31.5\n\n| label18   = \nVladimir region\n| data18    = \n31.4\n\n| label19   = \nTambov region\n| data19    = \n31.2\n| label20   = \nPenza region\n| data20    = \n30.7\n\n| label21   = \nMurmansk region\n| data21    = \n30.5\n\n| label22   = \nPskov region\n| data22    = \n30.3\n\n| label23   = \nRepublic of Tatarstan\n| data23    = \n28.2\n| label24   = \nOrenburg region\n| data24    = \n27.7\n\n| label25   = \n'''Russia'''\n| data25    = \n27.3\n\n| label26   = \nKemerovo region\n| data26    = \n27.3\n\n| label27   = \nRyazan region\n| data27    = \n27.1\n\n| label28   = \nIrkutsk region\n| data28    = \n26.5\n\n| label29   = \nRepublic of Bashkortostan (Bashkiria)\n| data29    = \n25.5\n\n| label30   = \nRepublic of Buryatia\n| data30    = \n24.9\n\n}}\n\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| label_type  = REGION\n| data_type   = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| bar_width   = 50\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 57\n\n| label1   = \nKrasnoyarsk Krai\n| data1    = \n24.6\n\n| label2   = \nChelyabinsk region\n| data2    = \n24.5\n\n| label3   = \nAstrakhan region\n| data3    = \n23.9\n\n| label4   = \nZabaikalsky Krai\n| data4    = \n22.8\n\n| label5   = \nSaratov region\n| data5    = \n22.1\n\n| label6   = \nVologda region\n| data6    = \n22.1\n\n| label7   = \nKursk region\n| data7    = \n21.9\n\n| label8   = \nOrel region\n| data8    = \n21.8\n\n| label9   = \nMari El Republic\n| data9    = \n20.9\n\n| label10   = \nNovosibirsk region\n| data10    = \n20.4\n\n| label11   = \nTula region\n| data11    = \n20.3\n\n| label12   = \nUdmurt Republic (Udmurtia)\n| data12    = \n20.2\n\n| label13   = \nPerm Krai\n| data13    = \n20\n\n| label14   = \nKostroma region\n| data14    = \n19.1\n\n| label15   = \n'''United States'''\n| data15    = \n18.8\n\n| label16   = \nKaliningrad region\n| data16    = \n18.8\n\n| label17   = \nOmsk region\n| data17    = \n18.7\n\n| label18   = \nIvanovo region\n| data18    = \n17.9\n\n| label19   = \nKrasnodar Krai\n| data19    = \n17.6\n\n| label20   = \nBelgorod region\n| data20    = \n16.8\n\n| label21   = \nRostov region\n| data21    = \n15.3\n\n| label22   = \nVoronezh region\n| data22    = \n15\n\n| label23   = \nLeningrad region\n| data23    = \n14.3\n\n| label24   = \n'''United Kingdom'''\n| data24    = \n12.9\n\n| label25   = \nSevastopol (city;

More than 55 thousand beds for infectious cases were deployed, including more than 12 thousand intensive care units and 396 observatories. 7.5 thousand Melzer boxes were prepared. Medical organizations have more than 40 thousand devices for artificial lung ventilation, 124 devices for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The government of the Russian Federation has allocated resources for the additional purchase of more than 500 devices, including 17 ECMO devices. Today, 6 thousand infectious diseases doctors and almost 2 thousand pulmonologists, more than 18 thousand nurses are ready to provide medical assistance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://government.ru/news/39218/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200321055046/http://government.ru/news/39218/ |archive-date=21 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAccording to the [[OECD]], Russia ranks third in the number of beds per capita. However, bed equipment varies from hospital to hospital. In terms of equipment \u2014 for example, CT and MRI devices \u2014 Russia is in 28th place with a dramatic gap from the leaders. [[Rosstat]] does not publish data on the number of places in intensive care units and equipment. In total, there are 1 million 172 thousand beds in Russian hospitals, according to Rosstat data for 2018. These include intensive care units. Intensive care bed means a bed equipped with a set of equipment for resuscitation and intensive care, including ventilators. The Institute of Phthisiopulmonology and infectious diseases of the Ministry of Health estimated the number of intensive care beds at just 12 thousand, which is three times less than the Ministry of Health's standard. The proekt.media website was able to find data on the number of intensive care beds in only 23 regions. Only Moscow, Kalmykia, Altai and Komi reached the standard of 3%. Other regions are significantly below the standard.<br/>Separate ventilators in hospitals should be more than intensive care beds. The number of ventilators in a region should be at least 1.5 times more than the number of intensive care beds. There are no official statistics on the number of ventilators. Federal authorities with the beginning of the epidemic conducted their own calculations: Deputy Prime Minister [[Tatyana Golikova]] said that Russia has 40 thousand ventilators. This is 3.4% of the total number of beds in Russia, and more than 12 thousand devices are missing from the standards of the Ministry of health. This is a total deficit of 23%, but in some regions it is much larger. The website asks, can we be sure that all the devices included in the statistics are in working order? 58% of ventilators are more than 9 years old. Components may require more frequent replacement. For example, the oxygen sensor of the American model common in Russia, [[Puritan Bennett]], is subject to replacement every two years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.proekt.media/research/koronavirus-regiony/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200404095318/https://www.proekt.media/research/koronavirus-regiony/ |archive-date=4 April 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nData collected by the news website [[Meduza]] indicates that Russia's supply of ventilators is quite extensive: Even the number available per capita in some geographically peripheral regions, not to mention Moscow, significantly exceeds ventilator supplies in Western countries.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/21/the-ventilator-problem |title=Archived copy |access-date=4 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326174233/https://meduza.io/en/feature/2020/03/21/the-ventilator-problem |archive-date=26 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n{{Collapse top}}\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| label_type  = REGION\n| data_type   = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| bar_width   = 50\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 57\n\n| label1   = \nKhanty-Mansi AO\n| data1    = \n56.8\n\n| label2   = \nSamara region\n| data2    = \n42.6\n\n| label3   = \nAmur region\n| data3    = \n42.5\n\n| label4   = \nMoscow (city)\n| data4    = \n40\n\n| label5   = \nKirov region\n| data5    = \n39.6\n\n| label6   = \nArkhangelsk region\n| data6    = \n38.4\n\n| label7   = \nSakha Republic (Yakutia)\n| data7    = \n37.2\n\n| label8   = \nSakhalin region\n| data8    = \n37.1\n\n| label9   = \nTomsk region\n| data9    = \n37.1\n\n| label10   = \nSt. Petersburg (city)\n| data10    = \n35.2\n\n| label11   = \nLipetsk region\n| data11    = \n35.1\n\n| label12   = \nSverdlovsk region\n| data12    = \n35\n\n| label13   = \nChuvash Republic (Chuvashia)\n| data13    = \n34.7\n\n| label14   = \nAltai Krai\n| data14    = \n34.6\n\n| label15   = \nRepublic of Crimea (status disputed)\n| data15    = \n34.3\n\n| label16   = \nRepublic of Karelia\n| data16    = \n32.5\n\n| label17   = \nYaroslavl region\n| data17    = \n31.5\n\n| label18   = \nVladimir region\n| data18    = \n31.4\n\n| label19   = \nTambov region\n| data19    = \n31.2\n| label20   = \nPenza region\n| data20    = \n30.7\n\n| label21   = \nMurmansk region\n| data21    = \n30.5\n\n| label22   = \nPskov region\n| data22    = \n30.3\n\n| label23   = \nRepublic of Tatarstan\n| data23    = \n28.2\n| label24   = \nOrenburg region\n| data24    = \n27.7\n\n| label25   = \n'''Russia'''\n| data25    = \n27.3\n\n| label26   = \nKemerovo region\n| data26    = \n27.3\n\n| label27   = \nRyazan region\n| data27    = \n27.1\n\n| label28   = \nIrkutsk region\n| data28    = \n26.5\n\n| label29   = \nRepublic of Bashkortostan (Bashkiria)\n| data29    = \n25.5\n\n| label30   = \nRepublic of Buryatia\n| data30    = \n24.9\n\n}}\n\n{{Bar chart\n| title       = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| label_type  = REGION\n| data_type   = VENTILATORS PER 100,000 RESIDENTS\n| bar_width   = 50\n| width_units = em\n| data_max    = 57\n\n| label1   = \nKrasnoyarsk Krai\n| data1    = \n24.6\n\n| label2   = \nChelyabinsk region\n| data2    = \n24.5\n\n| label3   = \nAstrakhan region\n| data3    = \n23.9\n\n| label4   = \nZabaikalsky Krai\n| data4    = \n22.8\n\n| label5   = \nSaratov region\n| data5    = \n22.1\n\n| label6   = \nVologda region\n| data6    = \n22.1\n\n| label7   = \nKursk region\n| data7    = \n21.9\n\n| label8   = \nOrel region\n| data8    = \n21.8\n\n| label9   = \nMari El Republic\n| data9    = \n20.9\n\n| label10   = \nNovosibirsk region\n| data10    = \n20.4\n\n| label11   = \nTula region\n| data11    = \n20.3\n\n| label12   = \nUdmurt Republic (Udmurtia)\n| data12    = \n20.2\n\n| label13   = \nPerm Krai\n| data13    = \n20\n\n| label14   = \nKostroma region\n| data14    = \n19.1\n\n| label15   = \n'''United States'''\n| data15    = \n18.8\n\n| label16   = \nKaliningrad region\n| data16    = \n18.8\n\n| label17   = \nOmsk region\n| data17    = \n18.7\n\n| label18   = \nIvanovo region\n| data18    = \n17.9\n\n| label19   = \nKrasnodar Krai\n| data19    = \n17.6\n\n| label20   = \nBelgorod region\n| data20    = \n16.8\n\n| label21   = \nRostov region\n| data21    = \n15.3\n\n| label22   = \nVoronezh region\n| data22    = \n15\n\n| label23   = \nLeningrad region\n| data23    = \n14.3\n\n| label24   = \n'''United Kingdom'''\n| data24    = \n12.9\n\n| label25   = \nSevastopol (city;

The known Pidgins included:\n\n* [[Algonquian\u2013Basque pidgin]] (spoken among Basque whalers and various Algonquian peoples and last attested in 1710),\n* [[Broken Slavey]] (spoken by indigenous and European residents of the Yukon area in the 19th century)\n* [[Chinook Jargon]] (spoken by members of indigenous, neighbouring, Hawaiian, Chinese, English, French, and other nations throughout the Pacific Northwest; reaching its peak in around 1900 with an estimated 100,000 speakers; and still spoken today),\n* [[Eskimo Trade Jargon]] (spoken by the Mackenzie River Inuit and the Athabaskan peoples to their South until at least 1909),\n* [[Haida Jargon]] (spoken mostly by the English and the Haida until the 1830s),\n* [[Labrador Inuit Pidgin French]] (spoken between Breton and Basque fishermen and the Inuit of Labrador from the late 17th century to about 1760), and\n* [[Plains Indian Sign Language]] (spoken by speakers of 37 oral languages in 12 families spread across an area of 2.6 million square kilometres stretching from what are now northern Mexico to the southern Northwest Territories, and from the Pacific Northwest to the Saint-Laurence Seaway).\n\nFrench has been a language of government in the part of Canada that is today Quebec, with limited interruptions, since the arrival of the first French settlers in Canada in 1604 (Acadians) and in 1608 in Quebec, and has been entrenched in the Constitution of Canada since 1867. English has been a language of government in each of the provinces since their inception as British colonies.\n\nInstitutional bilingualism in various forms therefore predates the Canadian Confederation in 1867. However, for many years English occupied a ''de facto'' privileged position, and French was not fully equal. The two languages have gradually achieved a greater level of equality in most of the provinces, and full equality at the federal level. In the 1970s French in Quebec became the province's official language.\n\n===After confederation===\n[[File:Bilingualstopsign.jpg|right|thumb|Bilingual (English/French) [[stop sign]] on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clo-ocol.gc.ca/fr/publications/portrait-linguistique-ottawa|title=Portrait des groupes de langues officielles de la r\u00e9gion d'Ottawa|first=Bo\u00eete \u00e0 outils de l'exp\u00e9rience|last=Web|date=6 March 2015|website=www.clo-ocol.gc.ca}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Paladins scoreboard Royal Military College of Canada.JPG|thumb|right|[[Royal Military College Paladins]] Bilingual (English/French) [[Scoreboard]], inner field, [[Royal Military College of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rmc-cmr.ca/en/rmc-brochure|title=The RMC Brochure|first=Brigitte|last=Conrad-Avarmaa|date=3 November 2017|website=www.rmc-cmr.ca}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Corso Italia Ottawa street sign.jpg|thumb|[[Bilingual]] ([[French language|French]]/[[English language|English]]) sign for Preston Street (rue Preston) in [[Ottawa]], placed above a sign marking that the [[street]] is in [[Little Italy, Ottawa|Little Italy]].

This system, combined with education, immigration, and other policies promoting English and French, contributed greatly to the promotion of English and French across Canada.\n\n==Constitutional provisions on official languages==\n{{main|Constitution of Canada}}\n\n===Constitution Act, 1867 (section 133)===\nEnglish and French have had limited constitutional protection since 1867. Section 133 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' guarantees that both languages may be used in the Parliament of Canada, in its journals and records, and in court proceedings in any court established by the Parliament of Canada. The section also mandates that all Acts of the Parliament of Canada be printed and published in both languages. Guarantees for the equal status of the two official languages are provided in sections 16\u201323 of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', which became law in 1982. Sections 16\u201319 guarantee the equal status of both languages in Parliament, in all federal government institutions, and in federal courts. These sections also mandate that all statutes, records and journals of Parliament be published in both languages, with the English and French versions both holding equal status before the courts. [[Section Twenty of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 20]] guarantees the right of the Canadian public to communicate in English and French with any central government office or with regional offices where there is \"a significant demand for communication with and services from that office\". Significant demand is not defined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. One of the purposes of the ''[[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]]'' of 1988 was to remedy this omission.\n\nThe ''Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' includes similar constitutional obligations making [[New Brunswick]] the only officially bilingual province in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=1982-04-17|title=Canadian charter of rights and freedoms: Official Languages of Canada|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/const_en.html#langues}}</ref>\n\n[[Section Twenty-one of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 21]] ensured that the new Charter of Rights and Freedoms would be read as supplementing, rather than replacing any rights of the English and French languages, which had been constitutionalized prior to 1982. [[Section Twenty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 22]] ensured that the new Charter of Rights and Freedoms would not be interpreted by the courts as placing any new restrictions on non-official languages.\n\n===Education Rights (section 23 of the Charter and section 59 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'')===\nSection 23 provides a limited right to receive publicly funded primary and secondary-schooling in the two official languages when they are \"in a minority situation\"\u2014in other words, to English-language schooling in Quebec, and to French-language schooling in the rest of the country.\n\n====Asymmetrical application of education rights in Quebec versus elsewhere in Canada====\nThe right applies asymmetrically because section 59 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', provides that not all of the language rights listed in section 23 will apply in Quebec. Specifically:\n*In Quebec, a child may receive free public education in English only if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in English.\n*In the rest of Canada, a child may receive free public education in French if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in French, or if at least one parent has French as his or her [[First language|mother tongue]] (defined in section 23 as \"first language learned and still understood\").\nNone of these education language rights precludes parents from placing their children in a private school (which they pay for) in the language of their choice; it applies only to subsidized public education.\n\nOne practical consequence of this asymmetry is that all migrants who arrive in Quebec from foreign countries only have access to French-language public schools for their children. This includes immigrants whose mother tongue is English and immigrants who received their schooling in English. On the other hand, Section 23 provides a nearly universal right to English-language schooling for the children of Canadian-born anglophones living in Quebec.\n\nSection 23 also provides, subject only to the \"where numbers warrant\" restriction, a right to French-language schooling for the children of all francophones living outside Quebec, including immigrants from French-speaking countries who settle outside Quebec, and who are Canadian citizens.\n\nHowever, admission to French-language schools outside Quebec remains restricted in some ways it is not in Quebec. In particular, rights holder parents who choose to enroll their child in English school may thereby deprive that child's descendants of the right to attend French school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elfontario.ca/en/admission-criteria.html |title=French Education System Admission Criteria &#124; Fle |publisher=Elfontario.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref> In Quebec, under article 76.1 of the ''Charter of the French Language'', rights holders do not deprive their descendants of the right to an English-language education by choosing to enroll their children in French school. (This applies if certain administrative steps are taken at each generation. Otherwise, the right may still be transmitted to grandchildren under article 76.)\n\nAnother element of asymmetry between Quebec and most anglophone provinces is that while Quebec provides public English-language primary and secondary education throughout the province, most other provinces provide French-language education only \"where numbers warrant\".\n\n====Additional restrictions on education rights====\nThere are some further restrictions on minority-language education rights:\n#The rights attach to the parent, not the child, and non-citizens residing in Canada do not have access to this right (even if their children are born in Canada).\n#If the parents' English-language or French-language education took place outside Canada, this does not entitle the child to be educated in that language.\n#The right to receive public funding can only be exercised in localities where \"...the number of children of citizens who have such a right is sufficient to warrant the provision to them out of public funds....\"<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=1982-04-17|title=Canadian charter of rights and freedoms: Minority Language Educational Rights|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/const_en.html#instruction}}</ref>\n\n====Ambiguous definition of entitlement to education rights====\nThe phrase, \"where numbers ... warrant\" is not defined in Section 23. Education is under provincial jurisdiction, which means that it has not been possible for Parliament to enact a single nationwide definition of the term, as the 1988 ''Official Languages Act'' did for the constitutional obligation to provide federal services where \u201cthere is a sufficient demand.\u201d As a result, disputes over the extent of the right to a publicly funded minority-language education have been the source of much litigation.\n\nThe defining case was ''[[Mahe v. Alberta]]'' (1990), in which the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] declared that section 23 guaranteed a \"sliding scale\". In certain circumstances, the children whose parents could exercise the right might be so few that literally no minority language education may be provided by the government. With a greater number of children, some schools might be required to provide [[classroom]]s in which the children could receive minority language education. An even greater number would require the [[construction]] of new schools dedicated solely to minority language education. More recent cases, which have significantly extended these rights, include ''[[Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island]]'' (2000) and ''[[Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)]]'' (2003).\n\n===Language of the official text of the Constitution===\nMany of the documents in Canada's Constitution do not have an official French-language version; for legal purposes only the English-language version is official and any French translations are unofficial. In particular, the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' (which created Canada as a legal entity and still contains the most important provisions of governmental powers) has no official French-language version, because it was enacted by the United Kingdom Parliament, which functions in the English language exclusively. Similarly, all other parts of the Constitution that were enacted by the United Kingdom (with the important exception of the ''[[Canada Act 1982]]'') have no official French-language version.\n\nSections 55\u201357 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' set out a framework for changing this situation. Section 55 calls for French versions of all parts of the Constitution that exist only in English to be prepared as quickly as possible. Section 56 provided that, following adoption of the French versions, both the English-language and French-language versions would be equally authoritative. To avoid the situation where an inaccurately translated French version would have a weight equal to the English original, Section 55 requires that the French-language versions be approved using the same process under which actual constitutional amendments are adopted.\n\nPursuant to section 55, a French Constitutional Drafting Committee produced French-language versions of all the British North America Acts in the decade following 1982. However, these versions were never ratified under the Constitution\u2019s amendment procedure, and therefore have never been officially adopted.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/const/loireg/intro.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030923020754/http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/const/loireg/intro.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2003-09-23 | accessdate=2007-12-18 | work=Final Report of the French Constitutional Drafting Committee | title=Introduction }}</ref>\n\nSection 57 states that the \u201cEnglish and French versions of this Act [ie. the ''Constitution Act, 1982''] are equally authoritative.\u201d The purpose of this provision is to clear up any ambiguity that might have existed about the equal status of the two versions as a result of the novel way in which this part of Canada's supreme law came into force. Had the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' been enacted as most preceding amendments to Canada's constitution had been, as a statute of the British parliament, it would, like any other British statute, have been an English-only document. Instead, the British parliament enacted a very concise law, (the ''[[Canada Act 1982]]''), written in English only. The operative clauses of the ''Canada Act, 1982'' simply state that an appendix to the Act (the appendix is formally referred to as a \"schedule\") is to be integrated into the Canadian constitution. The schedule contains the complete text of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', in both English and French.<ref>Schedule 'A' of the ''Canada Act'' is a French version of the operative clauses of the ''Canada Act''. Schedule 'B' contains the text of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', in both English and French.</ref>\n\n==Federal legislation on official languages==\n===Official Languages Act===\n{{main|Official Languages Act (Canada)}}\n[[File:Government of Canada signature.svg|500px|thumb|right|A bilingual sign in [[Canada]].]]\nCanada adopted its first ''Official Languages Act'' in 1969,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/official-languages-act-1969|title=Official Languages Act (1969)|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref> in response to the recommendations of the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]]. The current ''Official Languages Act'' was adopted in 1988 to improve the 1969 law's efforts to address two basic policy objectives: (1) to specify the powers, duties and functions of federal institutions relevant to official languages; (2) to support the development of linguistic minority communities. As well, following the adoption in 1982 of the ''Charter of Rights'', it was necessary to create a legislative framework within which the Government of Canada could respect its new constitutional

influence on the status of English and French in Canada==\nBook I Chapter 1.C of the report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, published on 8 October 1967, acknowledges the international influence on Canadian language policy:\n{{quote|Compared to other bilingual states \u2013 among them Finland, South Africa, and Belgium, which we shall discuss later \u2013\u00a0Canada is fortunate that her official languages both have international status\u2026\n\nIn Canada, however, one of the two language groups begins with a considerable advantage. As the national language of the United States, one of the most powerful countries of the world, English has a massive preponderance in North America. Thus the English-language group in this country draws much of its strength from the English-speaking population of our neighbour. The French-language group is, on the other hand, a minority on the North American continent and suffers from its isolation not only from France but from the other French speaking peoples of the world.<ref name=\"publications.gc.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/site/archivee-archived.html?url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2014/bcp-pco/Z1-1963-1-5-1-1-eng.pdf|title=Information archiv\u00e9e dans le Web|website=publications.gc.ca}}</ref>}}\n\n==Official bilingualism in the public service==\n{{main|Official bilingualism in the public service of Canada}}\nThe issue of proportional hiring and promotion of speakers of both official languages has been an issue in Canadian politics since before Confederation. Members of each linguistic group have complained of injustice when their group have been represented, in public service hiring and promotion, in numbers less than would be justified by their proportion of the national population. For the greater part of Canada\u2019s history, French-speakers were underrepresented, and English-speakers were overrepresented in the ranks of the public service, and the disproportion became more pronounced in the more senior ranks of public servants. However, this trend has reversed itself in recent decades.\n\nThe first high-profile complaint of preferential hiring took place in 1834. One of the [[Ninety-Two Resolutions]] of the [[Lower Canada|Lower Canadian]] House of Assembly drew attention to the fact that French Canadians, who at the time were 88% of the colony's population, held only 30% of the posts in the 157-member colonial civil service. Moreover, the resolution stated, French Canadians were, \"for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those [British immigrants] who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices....\"<ref>Resolution 75. Resolved, That the number of the Inhabitants of the country being about 600,000, those of French origin are about 525,000, and those of British or other origin 75,000; and that the establishment of the civil government of Lower Canada, for the year 1832, accordingly to the yearly returns made by the Provincial Administration, for the information of the British Parliament, contained the names of 157 officers and others receiving salaries, who are apparently of British or foreign origin and the names of 47 who are, apparently, natives of the country, of French origin; that this statement does not exhibit the whole disproportion which exists in the distribution of the public money and power, the latter class being, for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices; that the accumulation of many of the best paid and most influential, and at the same time incompatible, offices in the same person, which is forbidden by the laws and by sound policy, exists especially for the benefit of the former class; and that two-thirds of the persons included in the last commission of the peace issued in the province, are apparently of British or foreign origin, and one-third only of French origin.</ref>\n\nWith the advent of [[responsible government]] in the 1840s, the power to make civil service appointments was transferred to elected politicians, who had a strong incentive to ensure that French Canadian voters did not feel that they were being frozen out of hiring and promotions. Although no formal reform of the hiring and promotion process was ever undertaken, the patronage-driven hiring process seems to have produced a more equitable representation of the two language groups. In the period between 1867 and the turn of the Twentieth Century, French-Canadians made up about one-third of the Canadian population, and seem also to have represented about one-third of civil service appointments at junior levels, although they had only about half that much representation at the most senior level.<ref>[[Eugene Forsey]] writes: \u201cIn the Dominion Civil Service, C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s \u2018\u2019Political Appointments\u2019\u2019, 1867\u20131895, shows that, over that period, eliminating duplications, the French Canadians had rather over a third of the official of the House and of the two Dominion Courts; rather less than a third of other officials of the rank of Deputy Minister and, of the officials from Chief Clerk up to Deputy Minister rather less than one-seventh.\u201d\nSource\u2014Eugene Forsey, \u2018\u2019Freedom and Order: Collected Essays.\u2019\u2019 Ottawa: Carleton University Press, 1974, p. 243.</ref>\n\n==Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories==\n{{main|Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories}}\n\nCanada's thirteen provinces and territories have adopted widely diverging policies with regard to minority-language services for their respective linguistic minorities. Given the wide range of services, such as policing, health care and education, that fall under provincial jurisdiction, these divergences have considerable importance.\n\n===New Brunswick===\nOf Canada's ten provinces, only one ([[New Brunswick]]) has voluntarily chosen to become officially bilingual. New Brunswick's bilingual status is constitutionally entrenched under the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. Sections 16\u201320 of the ''Charter'' include parallel sections guaranteeing the same rights at the federal level and at the provincial level (New Brunswick only).\n*Section 16(2) is a largely symbolic statement that \"English and French are the official languages of New Brunswick\" with \"equality of status\".\n*Section 17(2) guarantees the right to use English or French in the New Brunswick legislature\n*Section 18(2) states that New Brunswick's laws will be bilingual, with both texts equally authoritative, and that official publications will be bilingual.\n*Section 19(2) guarantees the right to use either official language in all New Brunswick court proceedings.\n*Section 20(2) guarantees the right to receive provincial government services in either official language.\n\n===Manitoba===\nManitoba is the only province that was officially bilingual at the time of its establishment.\nFollowing the [[Red River Rebellion]] led by the Francophone [[M\u00e9tis]] [[Louis Riel]], the [[Manitoba Act]] was passed, creating the province and mandating the equal status of English and French in all legislative bodies, legislative records, laws and court proceedings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Parliament of Canada|date=12 May 1870|title=Manitoba Act, 1870|url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ma_1870.html}}</ref> At this time, Manitoba

the protests of Franco-Manitobans that the Manitoba Act had been violated, Manitoba remained monolingual in practice until the early 1980s, when legal challenges created a crisis that threatened to

text]]French has been the only official language in Quebec since 1974, when the Liberal government of [[Robert Bourassa]] enacted [[Official Language Act (Quebec)|''The Official Language Act'']] (better-known as \"Bill 22\"). However, the province's language law does provide for limited services in English. As well, the province is obliged, under Section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867, to allow the provincial legislature to operate in both French and English, and to allow all Quebec courts to operate in both languages. Section 23 of the Charter applies to Quebec, but to a more limited degree than in other provinces. Quebec is required to provide an education in English to all children whose Canadian citizen parents were educated in English in Canada, while all other provinces are required to provide an education in French to the children of Canadian citizen parents who either received their education in French in Canada or whose native tongue is French.\n\nIn 1977, the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] government of [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]] introduced the ''[[Charter of the French Language]]'' (better known as \"Bill 101\") to promote and preserve the French language in the province, indirectly disputing the federal bilingualism policy. Initially, Bill 101 banned the use of all languages but French on most commercial signs in the province (except for companies with four employees or fewer), but those limitations were later loosened by allowing other languages on signs, as long as the French version is predominant. Bill 101 also requires that children of most immigrants residing in Quebec attend French-language public schools; the children of Canadian citizens who have received their education in Canada in English may attend English-language public schools, which are operated by English-language school boards throughout the province. The controversy over this part of Quebec's language legislation has lessened in recent years as these laws became more entrenched and the public use of French increased.<ref>[http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/langlaws.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209161455/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/langlaws.htm |date=December 9, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nQuebec's language laws have been the subject of a number of legal rulings. In 1988, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in the case of ''[[Ford v. Quebec (A.G.)]]'' that the commercial sign law provisions of Bill 101, which banned the use of the English language on outdoor signs, were unconstitutional. In 1989, the Quebec National Assembly invoked the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|\"Notwithstanding Clause\"]] of the Charter of Rights to set aside enforcement of the court ruling for five years. A UN appeal of the 'McIntyre Case' resulted in a condemnation of Quebec's sign law \u2014 regardless of the legality of the notwithstanding clause under Canadian law. In response, in 1993 Quebec enacted amendments to the sign law, availing itself of the suggestions proposed in the losing 1988 Supreme Court ruling by allowing other languages on commercial signs, subject to French being ''markedly predominant'' .\n\nOn March 31, 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled unanimously that the interpretation made by the provincial administration of the \"major part\" criterion in Quebec's ''language of instruction'' provisions violated the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. This criterion allows students who have completed the \"major part\" of their primary education in English in Canada to continue their studies in English in Quebec. The Court did not strike down the law but, as it had done in its 1988 ruling on sign laws, presented the province with a set of criteria for interpreting the law in conformity with the ''Charter of Rights'', broadening the interpretation of the phrase \"major part\".\n\n===Territories===\nFrench and English are official languages in Canada's three federal territories: [[Yukon]], [[Nunavut]], and the [[Northwest Territories]]. Nunavut and the Northwest Territories also accord official language status to several indigenous languages. [[Inuktitut]] and [[Inuinnaqtun]] are official languages in Nunavut because of the territory's [[Inuit]] population. The Northwest Territories accords official status to nine aboriginal languages ([[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Gwich\u2019in language|Gwich\u2019in]], Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, [[Inuvialuktun]], [[Slavey language|North Slavey]], [[Slavey language|South Slavey]] and [[Dogrib language|T\u0142\u012fch\u01eb/Dogrib]]). NWT residents have the right to use any of the territory's eleven official languages in a territorial court and in debates and proceedings of the legislature. However, laws are legally binding only in their French and English versions, and the government publishes laws and other documents in the territory's other official languages only when asked by the legislature. Furthermore, access to services in any language is limited to institutions and circumstances where there is significant demand for that language or where it is reasonable to expect it given the nature of the services requested. In practice, this means that only English language services are universally available, and there is no guarantee that any particular government service will use other languages except the courts. Following a 2006 territorial supreme court ruling, ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Franco-T\u00e9noise v. Canada (Attorney General)'', universal French-language services are also mandatory.\n\nThis is despite the fact that the proportion of native French-speakers in the territories is negligible, and they are vastly outnumbered by speakers of indigenous languages. At the 2016 census, there were 1,455 \"mother-tongue\" speakers of French in Yukon (4.3%), 1,175 in the Northwest Territories (2.9%), and 595 in Nunavut (1.7%).<ref>2016 Canadian census data</ref>\n\n===Elsewhere in Canada===\n[[File:Tim hortons ualbany.jpg|thumb|The comments box in both French and English at the now-defunct Tim Hortons store in the [[University at Albany, State University of New York|SUNY Albany]] campus center.<ref>https://exhibitions.nysm.nysed.gov/albany/bios/french.html</ref>]]\nAlthough no Canadian province has officially adopted English as its sole official language, English is the de facto language of government services and internal government operations in Canada's seven remaining provinces. Service levels in French vary greatly from one province to another (and sometimes within different parts of the same province).\n\nFor example, under the terms of Ontario's 1986 ''[[French Language Services Act]]'', Francophones in 25 designated areas across the province\u2014but not in other parts of the province\u2014are guaranteed access to provincial government services in French. Similarly, since 2005, the City of Ottawa has been officially required under Ontario law,<ref>[http://www.ontla.on.ca/documents/Bills/38_Parliament/Session1/b163_e.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314091619/http://www.ontla.on.ca/documents/Bills/38_Parliament/Session1/b163_e.htm |date=March 14, 2005 }}</ref> to set a municipal policy on English and French.\n\nIn Alberta, the ''[[Alberta School Act]]'' protects the right of French-speaking people to receive school instruction in the French language in the province.\n\n==Language rights in the legal system==\nThere is considerable variation across Canada concerning the right to use English and French in legislatures and courts (federal, provincial and territorial).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clo-ocol.gc.ca/en/language_rights/provinces_territories|title=Official languages in the provinces and territories|first=Web Experience|last=Toolkit|date=23 March 2014|website=www.clo-ocol.gc.ca}}</ref>  Rights under federal law are consistent throughout Canada, but different provinces and territories have different approaches to language rights.  Three provinces (Manitoba, New Brunswick and Quebec) have constitutional guarantees for bilingualism and language rights.  Three other provinces (Alberta, Ontario and Saskatchewan) have statutory provisions relating to bilingualism in the legal system, as do each of the three territories (Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon).  Four provinces (British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island) are unilingual English.\n\nLanguage rights in the legal system are summarized in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This distinction was articulated in the 1967 report of the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]], which stated:\n{{cquote|A bilingual country is not one where all the inhabitants necessarily have to speak two languages; rather it is a country where the principal public and private institutions must provide services in two languages to the citizens, the vast majority of whom may well be unilingual.\"<ref>Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, Book I (General Introduction), Ottawa: Queen's Printer, p. xxviii, at paragraph 29.</ref>}} Nonetheless, the promotion of personal bilingualism in English and French is an important objective of official bilingualism in Canada.\n\nAt least 35% of [[Canadians]] speak more than one language. Moreover, fewer than 2% of Canadians cannot speak at least one of the two official languages.<ref>Statistics Canada, 2006 Census Profile of Federal Electoral Districts (2003 Representation Order): Language, Mobility and Migration and Immigration and Citizenship. Ottawa, 2007, p. 6, line 108. In 2006, Canada\u2019s population was 31,241,030. Of this, 520,385 Canadians, or 1.7%, did not speak either official language.</ref> However, of these multilingual Canadians, somewhat less than one fifth of the population (5,448,850 persons, or 17.4% of the Canadian population) are able to maintain a conversation in both of the official languages according to a self-assessment.<ref>Statistics Canada, 2006 Census Profile of Federal Electoral Districts (2003 Representation Order): Language, Mobility and Migration and Immigration and Citizenship. Ottawa, 2007, pp. 2, 6. Statistics Canada collects data on mother tongue, on \"first official language spoken\", and on bilingualism in French and English. However, the agency does not collect data on bilingualism in non-official languages (either persons who speak more than one non-official language, or who have an official language as their mother tongue and afterwards learn a non-official language). Thus, it is possible only to determine that 6,147,840 Canadians have a non-official language as their mother tongue (see p. 2, line 5), and that 520,385 Canadians do not speak either official language (see p. 6, line 108). Since all persons who speak neither official language must have a non-official language as their mother tongue, simple subtraction shows that 5,627,455 Canadians, or 18.0% of the population, are bilingual in a non-official language plus an official language.</ref> However, in Canada the terms \"bilingual\" and \"unilingual\" are normally used to refer to bilingualism in English and French. In this sense, nearly 83% of Canadians are ''unilingual''.\n\nKnowledge of the two official languages is largely determined by geography. Nearly 95% of Quebecers can speak French, but only 40.6% speak English. In the rest of the country, 97.6% of the population is capable of speaking English, but only 7.5% can speak French.<ref>Statistics Canada, 2006 Census Profile of Federal Electoral Districts (2003 Representation Order): Language, Mobility and Migration and Immigration and Citizenship. Ottawa, 2007, pp. 6, 60.</ref> Personal bilingualism is most concentrated in southern Quebec and a swath of territory sometimes referred to as the ''[[bilingual belt]]'', which stretches east from Quebec through northern and eastern New Brunswick and west through [[Ottawa]] and that part of Ontario lying to the east of Ottawa, as well as north-eastern Ontario. There is also a large [[Franco-Manitobans|French-speaking population]] in Manitoba. In all, 55% of bilingual Canadians are Quebecers,<ref>Statistics Canada, ''Population by knowledge of official language, by province or territory (2006 Census), http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo15-eng.htm. The 2006 census shows that 3017,860 Quebecers are bilingual, out of a total of 5,448,850 bilingual Canadians.</ref> and a high percentage of the bilingual population in the rest of Canada resides in Ontario and New Brunswick. Statistics Canada collects much of its language data from self-assessments.\n\n==Second-language education==\n{{main|Bilingual education}}\n\nCanada\u2019s thirteen provincial and territorial education systems place a high priority on boosting the number of bilingual high school graduates. For example, in 2008 New Brunswick's provincial government reconfirmed its goal of boosting the percentage of bilingualism among graduates from its current rate of 34% to 70% rate by 2012.<ref>See Jesse Robichaud, \"Keep parents involved in language education: Lord,\" in the Moncton Times and Transcript, February 21, 2008, and Daniel McHardie, \"Language battle: Education Minister will seek public input before responding to French Second Language Review,\" in New Brunswick Telegraph-Journal, February 28, 2008, p.

In Quebec and New Brunswick, French classes begin in Grade 1. In the other provinces, French classes typically start in Grade 4 or 5. Students normally receive about 600 hours of French-language classes by the time of graduation.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111142812/http://www.cpfnb.com/core_FAQ/CoreFAQ.html Miles Turnbull, \"Core French in Canada\", Canadian Parents for French (Wayback machine).]</ref> The goal of \u201cCore French\u201d programs is not to produce fully bilingual graduates, but rather \"to provide students with the ability to communicate adequately in the second language, and to provide students with linguistic tools to continue their second-language studies by building on a solid communicative base\".<ref>New Brunswick Department of Education, ''Policy Statement on Immersion and the Core Program''. Fredericton, 1983, p. xii.</ref> There are no mandatory core French class in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, and second-language courses are  mandatory only in BC.\n\nOne result of this is that comprehension levels are often lower than parents would prefer. A scholar who interviewed a former New Brunswick premier, as well as the province's deputy ministers of education and health and the chairman of its Board of Management and Official Languages Branch reports: \"[A]ll expressed reservations about the effectiveness of the Core program in promoting individual bilingualism and believed the program must be improved if anglophone students are to obtain a level of proficiency in the French language.\"<ref>Catherine Steele, ''Can Bilingualism Work?

In this program, at least 25% of all instruction must be in French. From Grades 4 through 8, this means that at least one course per year other than \"French as a Second Language\" must be taught solely in French. From Grades 9 through 12, along with taking the Extended French language course every year, students must complete their mandatory Grade 9 [[Geography]] and Grade 10 [[Canadian History]] credits in French. Students who complete these required courses and take one extra credit taught in French receive a [[wikt:certificate|certificate]] upon graduation in addition to their [[Ontario Secondary School Diploma|diploma]].\n\n====Intensive French====\nIntensive French is a method of FSL education that originated in Newfoundland. \nIn 2004, Intensive French began in some schools in British Columbia. Intensive French is a choice program (in offering schools) during the grade 6 year. For the first five months of the school year students spend 80% of their time learning French, with the other 20% being for math. The rest of the core curriculum (Social Studies, Science, and Language Arts in English) is condensed for the second half of the year, comprising 80% of the time, with one hour for French. In the grade 7 year students continue to have one hour of core French per day. This results in 600 hours of French instruction over the two years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mmecarr.ca/IFinBC.html |title=Intensive French \u2013 A British Columbia Perspective |author=Wendy Carr |publisher=Mmecarr.ca |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\n===English second-language education (ESL)===\nNew Brunswick, being an officially bilingual province, has both anglophone and francophone school districts.\n \n* The francophone districts have '''Core English''' programs teaching ESL.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnb.ca/0000/publications/mackay/appendixl.pdf |title=Current Status of the Education System in New Brunswick |date=January 30, 2005 |publisher=Gnb.ca |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\nQuebec's educations system provides ESL on a more restricted basis to the children of immigrants and to students who are members of the province's Francophone majority.\n* '''Core English''': Most non-anglophone students are required to enrol in French-language schools.

In the 1960s, a decade that interpreter Ronald Despr\u00e9s called the \u201cgolden age of simultaneous interpretation,\u201d it was not unusual for interpreters to put in 80-hour weeks. Marguerite Ouimet said that she spent more time in a booth than at home, as did many of her colleagues. From the mid-1970s onward, technician Jean-Pierre Dulude, whose outstanding skill was widely recognized in interpretation circles, supervised the installation of some 60 interpreters\u2019 booths on Parliament Hill, and in federal departments and buildings across the country. He took great care to ensure that the booths met national standards.\u2019<ref>{{Citation |last=Delisle |first=Jean |title=Fifty Years of Parliamentary Interpretation |url=http://revparl.ca/32/2/32n2_09e_Delisle.pdf |work=Canadian Parliamentary Review |pages=27\u201332 |publication-date=2009}}</ref>\n\nThe article goes on to state:\n\n\u2018The House cannot sit without interpreters and it has adjourned when the interpretation system experienced technical difficulties.\u2019\n\nA report of the Advisory Working Group on the Parliamentary Translation Services of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration revealed on 15 March 2018:\n\n\u2018Many of the respondents cited inconsistency and quality control as major issues when it came to translation. The quality of the service varies greatly from one translator to another and there are often errors in the translations even when a request for a secondary review is made. Some respondents noted that the two language versions of committee reports often do not convey the same meaning and that, in some cases, the translation is simply erroneous. Much time is reportedly spent by senators and staff reviewing the documents in question and ensuring that the translation is accurate. Other respondents reported that longer documents that had been translated by more than one individual were disjointed and difficult to read because a common style had not been used. Recommendations ranged from the need to hire specialized translators to facilitate the translation of committee reports on technical matters, to ensuring proper revision of translations before their delivery, and to the need to provide for a feedback mechanism that could be used to alert the Translation Bureau when errors were detected.\n\n\u2018Issues related to the quality of interpretation were also raised. Some senators reported hearing literal translations that did not convey the true meaning of what the speaker had said. Others noted that regional expressions were not properly interpreted. Many respondents asked if it would be possible to have the same interpreters covering the Chamber and specific committees as this would ensure continuity. The need to upgrade the Senate's technological equipment was raised as devices in some committee rooms did not work properly. Some committee clerks noted that a more modern way for clerks to provide material to the interpreters was needed. Such technological upgrades could make communication of information quicker and more efficient.\u2019<ref name=\"sencanada.ca\"/>\n\n===Direct monetary cost of official bilingualism===\nIn Official Language Policies of the Canadian Provinces: Costs and Benefits in 2006, published by the Fraser Institute in 2012, we read on page xii:\n\n\u2018In our previous study, Official Language Policies at the Federal Level in Canada: Costs and Benefits in 2006, we estimated that the total cost of federal bilingualism at $1.8 billion. Since these expenditures include transfers to provinces that are spent by them on official language programs (Vaillancourt and Coche, 2009: 25, table 1), aggregating federal, provincial, and local spending must net out these transfers to avoid double counting. Once transfers are netted out, we have $1.5 billion at the federal level and $868 million at the local and provincial level for a total rounded of $2.4 billion or $85 per capita for 2006/07.\u2019<ref>https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/official-language-policies-of-canadian-provinces-rev.pdf</ref>\n\n===Distribution of wealth between official and Deaf, indigenous, and other unofficial linguistic communities===\nIn MAKING THE MOST OF THE ACTION PLAN FOR OFFICIAL LANGUAGES 2018-2023: INVESTING IN OUR FUTURE, the standing Committee on Official languages states:\n\u2018CPF British Columbia and Yukon has already identified three strategies: recruiting from other provinces and territories and from abroad; supporting post-secondary institutions so they can train more teachers; and supporting teachers.\u2019<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/LANG/report-15/page-66|title=Committee Report No. 15 - LANG (42-1) - House of Commons of Canada|website=www.ourcommons.ca}}</ref>\n\nThe linguistic provisions of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]], the [[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]], the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-38/|title=Consolidated federal laws of canada, Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act|first=Legislative Services|last=Branch|date=15 January 2019|website=laws-lois.justice.gc.ca}}</ref> the [[Immigration and Refugee Protection Act]], and other laws obligate a greater demand for English and French speakers (even foreign ones if necessary) than a freer linguistic market would require.

A parallel question, \"Are you in favour of bilingualism for your province?\" also received a much more favourable response from Francophone respondents (most of whom were located in Quebec) than from Anglophone respondents, indicating that Francophones were consistently more supportive than Anglophones of a fully bilingual Quebec within a fully bilingual Canada, whereas Anglophones were consistently more supportive than Francophones of a unilingual French Quebec within a Canada where the other provinces are for the most part unilingual English.</ref> The ebb in support for bilingualism among anglophones can likely be attributed to political developments in the late 1980s and 1990s, including the failure of the [[Meech Lake Accord]], and the 1995 referendum on Quebec independence.<ref name=\"ocol-clo1\"/>\n\nBy 2006, affirmative responses to the question \"Are you personally in favour of bilingualism for all of Canada?\" had increased considerably, with 72% of Canadians (and 64% of anglophones) agreeing. 70% of Canadians, and 64% of anglophones were \"in favour of bilingualism for [their] province\".<ref name=\"ocol-clo1\"/> Support for bilingualism is thought likely to continue to increase, as young anglophones are more favourable to it than their elders.<ref name=\"ocol-clo1\"/>\n\nAccording to Turcotte and Parkin, other poll data reveal that \"in contrast to Francophones, Anglophones, in general, have resisted putting more government effort and resources into promoting bilingualism&nbsp;... What is revealing, however, is that only 11% of those outside Quebec said they disagreed with bilingualism in any form. Opposition seems to be directed to the actions of the federal government, rather than to bilingualism itself&nbsp;... [T]his distinction is key to understanding public opinion on the issue.\"<ref>Parkin and Turcotte, p. 10. The specific reference is to a 1977 poll in which 54% of non-Quebecers but only 34% of Quebecers identified with the statement, \"I generally agree with or support the principle of bilingualism but I disagree with the form bilingualism has taken under the present federal government.\"</ref> This helps to explain results that would otherwise seem contradictory, such as a 1994 poll in which 56% of Canadians outside Quebec indicated that they either strongly or moderately supported official bilingualism, but 50% agreed with a statement that \"the current official bilingualism policy should be scrapped because it's expensive and inefficient.\"<ref>Angus Reid Group, \"The National Angus Reid/Southam News Poll: Canadians' Views on Official Bilingualism\". Release date: April 29, 1994.</ref>\n\nIn English Canada, there is some regional variation in attitudes towards federal bilingualism policy, but it is relatively modest when compared to the divergence between the views expressed by Quebecers and those expressed in the rest of the country. For example, in a poll conducted in 2000, only 22% of Quebecers agreed with the statement, \u201cWe have gone too far in pushing bilingualism,\u201d while positive response rates in English Canada ranged from a low of 50% in the Atlantic to a high of 65% in the Prairies.<ref>Parkin and Turcotte, p. 11.</ref>\n\nBoth French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians tend to regard the capacity to speak the other official language as having cultural and economic value,<ref>Parkin and Turcotte, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> and both groups have indicated that they regard bilingualism as an integral element of the Canadian national identity. Once again, however, there is a marked divergence between the responses of French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians. In a 2003 poll, 75% of Francophones indicated that \"having two official languages, English and French\" made them proud to be Canadian. Among English-speakers, 55% said that bilingualism made them proud, but far higher percentages (86% and 94%, respectively) indicated that multiculturalism and the Charter of Rights made them feel proud.<ref>Parkin and Turcotte, p. 13.</ref>\n\n===Findings of Public Hearings===\nFrom time to time, boards or panels are commissioned, either by the federal government or the government of one of the provinces, to conduct hearings into the public\u2019s views on matters of policy. Some of these hearings have dealt largely, or even primarily, with official languages policy, and the responses that they have collected provide snapshots into the state of public opinion at particular points in time.\n\n====Findings of the public hearings into the Poirier-Bastarache Report (1985)====\nThe ''Advisory Committee on the Official Languages of New Brunswick'' was commissioned by the provincial legislature as a way of determining the response of the population to the 1982 Poirier-Bastarache Report, which had recommended a considerable expansion of French-language services.<ref>New Brunswick. Official Languages Branch (Bernard Poirier and Michel Bastarache).

Smith). Report of the Advisory Committee on Official Languages of New Brunswick. 1986.</ref>\n\nThe briefs submitted to the Advisory Committee were subsequently summarized in an academic study of the hearings in the following terms:\n\n{{cquote|Qualitative analysis illustrate[s] that, as the majority, anglophones are reticent about extending opportunities and services to the francophone minority for fear of placing themselves at a disadvantage, whether it be in the education system or civil service employment. Francophones, as the minority, resent the anglophone hesitancy to make available rights and privileges secured under the Official Languages Act of New Brunswick of 1969 and the Constitution Act (1982)&nbsp;... They favour their own schools, control over their education, increased access to civil service positions and services in their own language through separate institutions and administrations.<ref>Catherine Steele, ''Can Bilingualism Work? Attitudes Towards Language Policy in New Brunswick: The 1985 Public Hearings on the Poirier-Bastarache Report''. Fredericton: New Ireland Press, 1990, p. 89.</ref>}}\n\n====Findings of the Spicer Commission (1990)====\nIn late 1990, a six-man ''Citizens\u2019 Forum on Canada\u2019s Future'' was established by the federal government with a mandate to engage in \"a dialogue and discussion with and among Canadians&nbsp;... to discuss the values and characteristics fundamental to the well-being of Canada\". The Forum, which was headed by former Commissioner of Official Languages Keith Spicer, published a report in June 1991, which included a detailed discussion of Canadians\u2019 reactions to a variety of issues, including federal official languages policy.\n\nThese comments, which probably represent the most extensive consultation ever with Canadians on the subject of official bilingualism, were compiled statistically by the Spicer Commission, and tend to reinforce the findings of pollsters, that Canadians are favourable towards bilingual services, but frustrated with the implementation of official languages policy. Thus, for example, nearly 80% of group discussions sponsored by the Commission produced favourable comments from participants on what the Commission's report refers to as \"bilingualism generally\", but nearly 80% of these discussions produced negative comments on \"official languages policy\".<ref>Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future, Report to the People and Government of Canada. Ottawa: Minister of Supply and Services, 1991, p. 161.</ref>\n\nThese results prompted Spicer to write,\n\n{{cquote|Canada's use of two official languages is widely seen as a fundamental and distinctive Canadian characteristic. Among many, especially the young, the ability to speak, read and write both French and English is accepted as a significant personal advantage. Even many parents who dislike \"official bilingualism\" are eager to enrol their children in French immersion.\n\nOn the other hand, we find that the application of the official languages policy is a major irritant outside Quebec, and not much appreciated inside Quebec&nbsp;... In spite of real and needed progress in linguistic fair play in federal institutions, a sometimes mechanical, overzealous, and unreasonably costly approach to the policy has led to decisions to that have helped bring it into disrepute. Citizens tell us that bilingual bonuses, costly translation of technical manuals of very limited use, public servants' low use of hard-acquired French-language training, excessive designation of bilingual jobs, and a sometimes narrow, legalistic approach are sapping a principle they would otherwise welcome as part of Canada's basic identity.<ref>Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future, Report, pp. 125\u2013126.</ref>}}\n\n===Advocacy groups===\n;Advocacy in support of expanding / extending official bilingualism exclusively of other language communities\nA number of groups exist, which, as part of their mandate, seek to promote official bilingualism or to extend the scope of the policy (although advocacy is not always the sole, or even the primary activity, of the groups). Among these groups:\n*'''[[Alliance Quebec]]''' (defunct)\n* '''L'Association des municipalit\u00e9s francophones du Nouveau-Brunswick '''\n* '''Canadian Parents for French''', established with the assistance of the Commissioner of Official Languages in 1977, promotes French second-language education for children whose mother tongue is English;\n*'''Commission nationale des parents francophones'''\n*'''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des communaut\u00e9s francophones et acadienne du Canada''' serves as an umbrella for 22 groups representing French-speaking minorities in different provinces and territories;\n*'''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des jeunes francophones du Nouveau-Brunswick'''\n*'''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration nationale des conseils scolaires francophones'''\n*'''[[Francophone Association of Municipalities of Ontario]]''' seeks to oversee the maintenance and development of municipal government services in French, in Ontario municipalities with French-speaking populations.\n*'''Imp\u00e9ratif fran\u00e7ais''' seeks to promote the use of French within Quebec, and to challenge inequalities between the languages that may arise within areas of federal administration.\n*'''Quebec Community Groups Network''' serves as an umbrella for 38 English language community organizations across Quebec for the purposes of supporting and assisting the development and enhancing the vitality of the English-speaking minority communities;\n* '''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Acadiens et Acadiennes du Nouveau-Brunswick'''\n\n;Advocacy in favour of restraining or abolishing official bilingualism\nA number of groups have existed, since the first ''[[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]]'' was proclaimed in 1969, which sought to end official bilingualism or to reduce the scope of the policy. Among these groups:\n*'''The [[Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada]]''' (often referred to as \"APEC\"). In 2000, the group was renamed '''Canadians Against Bilingualism Injustice'''.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Canada Gazette|date=2000-02-26|title=Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada: Change of name and relocation of head office|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2000/2000-02-26/html/misc-divers-eng.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204145821/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2000/2000-02-26/html/misc-divers-eng.html|archivedate=2012-02-04}}</ref> In 2001, the organization changed its name again, becoming the '''Canadian Network for Language Awareness'''.;<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Canada Gazette Part I, p. 3872|date=2001-10-06|title=Supplementary letters patent (name change)|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2001/2001-10-06/pdf/g1-13540.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321014222/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2001/2001-10-06/pdf/g1-13540.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-21}}</ref>\n*'''[[Canadians for Language Fairness]]''';\n*'''The [[New Brunswick Association of English-speaking Canadians]]''' was formed in 1984 and disbanded in 1986. Its primary purpose was to oppose the proposals of the province's \"Poirier-Bastarache Committee\" for an expansion of the province's policy of official bilingualism.\n\nIn the first decade or so following the 1969 adoption of the Act, opposition to the new policy sometimes took a radical form that has subsequently nearly disappeared. Books such as Jock V. Andrew's ''[[Bilingual Today, French Tomorrow]]'', advocated either the repeal of the ''Official Languages Act'' or an end to the policy of official bilingualism. [[Leonard Jones]], the mayor of [[Moncton]], New Brunswick, was an aggressive opponent of bilingualism in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Jones challenged the validity of the ''Official Languages Act'' in court, arguing that the subject matter was outside the jurisdiction of the federal government. In 1974, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled against Jones, and [[Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick|found the law constitutional]]. In 1991, a local resurgence in anti-bilingualism sentiments allowed the [[New Brunswick Confederation of Regions Party|Confederation of Regions Party]] to win 21.2% of the vote in New Brunswick's provincial election and to briefly form the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|official opposition]] with eight seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick|provincial legislature]].\n\nSome organizations or individuals within certain movements also propose introducing a more inclusive language policy either via official multilingualism, or an official unilingual language policy in an auxiliary language so as to intrude minimally into the first-language choice of residents. Such ideas are sometimes inspired by Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights relating to discrimination on the basis of language, and Article 26(3) of the same Declaration so as to give parents the freedom \u201cto choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.\u201d Others can be inspired by religious or other beliefs.\n\n'''Assembly of First Nations''': National First Nations Language Strategy, presented by the Assembly of First Nations on 5 July 2007, inspired by previous statements including the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples presented in 1996, rejects official bilingualism in favour of linguistic equality for speakers of indigenous languages:\n\n\u201cFirst Nations seek legislated protection via a First Nations Languages Act that would be consistent with First Nations and Government of Canada laws dealing with languages.\u201d\n\n'''The [[French Nation of Canada]] (FRENCA)''': The NAFRAC favours a more interlingual approach to language policy that promotes the local sign language, the local indigenous language, Esperanto or another international auxiliary language, and more linguistic freedom in unofficial domains.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationfrancaiseducanada.com/|title=Accueil &#124; La nation fran\u00e7aise du Canada (NAFRAC)|website=La nation fran\u00e7aise}}</ref>\n\n===Positions of the federal political parties===\n====Language issues currently dividing the parties====\nThe issues on which Canada\u2019s political parties have most recently shown divergent voting patterns are two [[private members\u2019 bills]].\n\nThe first, ''An Act to amend the Official Languages Act (Charter of the French Language)'' (Bill C-482), was introduced by Bloc MP [[Pauline Picard]]. If adopted, it would have had the effect of amending the ''Official Languages Act'', the ''Canada Labour Code'', and the ''Canada Business Corporations Act'', to cause them to conform to the ''[[Charter of the French Language]]'', \u201ceffectively making the federal government French-only in the province,\u201d according to ''[[Maclean\u2019s]]''.<ref>Martin Patriquin, \u201cAre you still here?\u201d ''Maclean\u2019s'', February 25, 2008, p. 23.</ref> This bill was defeated in May 2008, with Bloc and NDP MPs voting in favour and Conservative and Liberal MPs opposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=2&DocId=3499224#T1755 |title=Official Report * Table of Contents * Number 095 (Official Version) |publisher=.parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\nThe second private member\u2019s bill is NDP MP [[Yvon Godin|Yvon Godin\u2019s]] ''Act to amend the Supreme Court Act (understanding the official languages)'' (Bill C-232). If adopted, this bill will have the effect of blocking any candidate who is not already sufficiently bilingual to understand oral arguments in both official languages from being appointed to the Supreme Court.

The new party adopted the principles of the old Progressive Conservatives as its founding principles, with only a handful of changes. One of these was the addition of the following founding principle, which is lifted almost verbatim from Section 16(1) of the ''Charter of Rights'':\n\n\"A belief that English and French have equality of status, and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions of the Parliament and Government of Canada.\"\n\nAt its founding convention in 2005, the new party added the following policy to its ''Policy Declaration'' (the official compilation of the policies that it had adopted at the convention):\n\n: \"The Conservative Party believes that Canada\u2019s official languages constitute a unique and significant social and economic advantage that benefit all Canadians.\n\n: \"i) A Conservative Government will support the Official Languages Act ensuring that English and French have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions of the Parliament and Government of Canada.\n\n: \"ii) The Conservative Party will work with the provinces and territories to enhance opportunities for Canadians to learn both official languages.\"<ref>''Conservative Party of Canada Policy Declaration'', March 2005, p. 32 (Policy #91).</ref>\n\nPrior to this, in the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Reform Party of Canada]] had advocated the policy's repeal. However, the party's position moderated with time. By 1999, the ''Blue Book'' (the party's declaration of its then-current policies) stated that \"The Reform Party supports official bilingualism in key federal institutions, such as Parliament and the Supreme Court, and in critical federal services in parts of the country where need is sufficient to warrant services on a cost-effective basis.\"<ref>''The 'Blue Book': Principles and Policy of the Reform Party of Canada \u2013 1999'', p. 40.</ref> By 2002, the policy declaration of the Reform Party's political successor, the [[Canadian Alliance]], had been moderated further, and stated that it was \"the federal government's responsibility to uphold minority rights\" by providing services in both languages in any \"rural township or city neighbourhood where at least ten percent of the local population uses either English or French in its daily life\".<ref>''Canadian Alliance Declaration of Policy'', April 2002, pp. 12\u201313.</ref>\n\n====Liberal Party of Canada====\nThe [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] sees itself as the party of official bilingualism, as it was a Liberal prime minister, [[Pierre Trudeau]], who enacted the first ''Official Languages Act'' in 1969 and who entrenched detailed protections for the two official languages in the ''Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' in 1982.\n\nThe depth of the party\u2019s commitment to official bilingualism is demonstrated by the fact that the constitution of the Liberal Party contains provisions modelled almost word-for-word on [[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 16(1)]] of the ''Charter of Rights'': \"English and French are the official languages of the Party and have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all federal institutions of the Party. In pursuing its fundamental purposes and in all its activities, the Party must preserve and promote the status, rights and privileges of English and French.\"<ref>Liberal Party of Canada, \u201cConstitution\u201d, as adopted and amended at the biennial convention, November 30 \u2013 December 1, 2006, Section 2(3).</ref>\n\n====New Democratic Party====\n[[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democrat]] MPs voted in favour of the 1969 ''Official Languages Act'', the 1988 ''Official Languages Act'', and the protections for the two official languages contained in the ''Charter of Rights''. More recently, the party has edged towards supporting an asymmetrical version of bilingualism. Early in 2008, the party\u2019s languages critic, [[Yvon Godin]], stated that its MPs would vote in favour of a bill, sponsored by the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which would cause federal institutions to operate on a French-preferred or French-only basis in Quebec.<ref>Yvon Godin, \u201cCommons Debates\u201d (Hansard), February 6, 2008, p. 2691.)</ref>\n\nIn 2017, NDP MP Romeo Saganash spoke forcefully against making Anglo-French bilingualism a requirement for Supreme-Court judges in addition to criticizing official bilingualism generally due to the linguistic barriers it imposes on indigenous candidates.<ref name=\"nationalpost.com\"/>\n\n====Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois====\nAlthough the main objective of the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] is to assist in the secession of Quebec, the party\u2019s parliamentary caucus has maintained an active interest in issues relating to official languages policy (for example, sending MPs to participate in the standing Commons committee on official languages). The party seeks to alter federal language policy, as it applies within Quebec, so as to eliminate the statutory equality of English that is guaranteed under the ''Official Languages Act'' and other federal legislation. In recent years, this has included introducing a private member's bill titled ''An Act to amend the Official Languages Act (Charter of the French Language)'' (better known as Bill C-482), intended to supersede the ''Official Languages Act'' with the ''Charter of the French Language'' for all federally regulated corporations within Quebec, this principle uses an [[asymmetrical]] conception of [[federalism]] in [[Canada]].<ref>https://www.amazon.ca/F\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme-asym\u00e9trique-minorit\u00e9s-linguistiques-nationales/dp/2894232225/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme&qid=1551722376&s=books&sr=1-6</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Attorney General of Quebec v.

This includes grants and contributions to groups representing the English-speaking minority in Quebec and the French-speaking minorities in the other provinces to assist with the establishment of an infrastructure of cultural supports and services.\n\nAt the provincial level, [[New Brunswick]] officially recognizes the equal status of French and English.

Due to the widespread trade that occurred between many linguistic communities, indigenous linguistic knowledge across northern North America appears to have consisted of bilingualism in the mother language and a pidgin as a standard. The known Pidgins included:\n\n* [[Algonquian\u2013Basque pidgin]] (spoken among Basque whalers and various Algonquian peoples and last attested in 1710),\n* [[Broken Slavey]] (spoken by indigenous and European residents of the Yukon area in the 19th century)\n* [[Chinook Jargon]] (spoken by members of indigenous, neighbouring, Hawaiian, Chinese, English, French, and other nations throughout the Pacific Northwest; reaching its peak in around 1900 with an estimated 100,000 speakers; and still spoken today),\n* [[Eskimo Trade Jargon]] (spoken by the Mackenzie River Inuit and the Athabaskan peoples to their South until at least 1909),\n* [[Haida Jargon]] (spoken mostly by the English and the Haida until the 1830s),\n* [[Labrador Inuit Pidgin French]] (spoken between Breton and Basque fishermen and the Inuit of Labrador from the late 17th century to about 1760), and\n* [[Plains Indian Sign Language]] (spoken by speakers of 37 oral languages in 12 families spread across an area of 2.6 million square kilometres stretching from what are now northern Mexico to the southern Northwest Territories, and from the Pacific Northwest to the Saint-Laurence Seaway).\n\nFrench has been a language of government in the part of Canada that is today Quebec, with limited interruptions, since the arrival of the first French settlers in Canada in 1604 (Acadians) and in 1608 in Quebec, and has been entrenched in the Constitution of Canada since 1867. English has been a language of government in each of the provinces since their inception as British colonies.\n\nInstitutional bilingualism in various forms therefore predates the Canadian Confederation in 1867. However, for many years English occupied a ''de facto'' privileged position, and French was not fully equal. The two languages have gradually achieved a greater level of equality in most of the provinces, and full equality at the federal level. In the 1970s French in Quebec became the province's official language.\n\n===After confederation===\n[[File:Bilingualstopsign.jpg|right|thumb|Bilingual (English/French) [[stop sign]] on [[Parliament Hill]] in [[Ottawa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clo-ocol.gc.ca/fr/publications/portrait-linguistique-ottawa|title=Portrait des groupes de langues officielles de la r\u00e9gion d'Ottawa|first=Bo\u00eete \u00e0 outils de l'exp\u00e9rience|last=Web|date=6 March 2015|website=www.clo-ocol.gc.ca}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Paladins scoreboard Royal Military College of Canada.JPG|thumb|right|[[Royal Military College Paladins]] Bilingual (English/French) [[Scoreboard]], inner field, [[Royal Military College of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rmc-cmr.ca/en/rmc-brochure|title=The RMC Brochure|first=Brigitte|last=Conrad-Avarmaa|date=3 November 2017|website=www.rmc-cmr.ca}}</ref>]]\n[[File:Corso Italia Ottawa street sign.jpg|thumb|[[Bilingual]] ([[French language|French]]/[[English language|English]]) sign for Preston Street (rue Preston) in [[Ottawa]], placed above a sign marking that the [[street]] is in [[Little Italy, Ottawa|Little Italy]].

This system, combined with education, immigration, and other policies promoting English and French, contributed greatly to the promotion of English and French across Canada.\n\n==Constitutional provisions on official languages==\n{{main|Constitution of Canada}}\n\n===Constitution Act, 1867 (section 133)===\nEnglish and French have had limited constitutional protection since 1867. Section 133 of the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' guarantees that both languages may be used in the Parliament of Canada, in its journals and records, and in court proceedings in any court established by the Parliament of Canada. The section also mandates that all Acts of the Parliament of Canada be printed and published in both languages. Guarantees for the equal status of the two official languages are provided in sections 16\u201323 of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', which became law in 1982. Sections 16\u201319 guarantee the equal status of both languages in Parliament, in all federal government institutions, and in federal courts. These sections also mandate that all statutes, records and journals of Parliament be published in both languages, with the English and French versions both holding equal status before the courts. [[Section Twenty of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 20]] guarantees the right of the Canadian public to communicate in English and French with any central government office or with regional offices where there is \"a significant demand for communication with and services from that office\". Significant demand is not defined in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. One of the purposes of the ''[[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]]'' of 1988 was to remedy this omission.\n\nThe ''Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' includes similar constitutional obligations making [[New Brunswick]] the only officially bilingual province in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=1982-04-17|title=Canadian charter of rights and freedoms: Official Languages of Canada|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/const_en.html#langues}}</ref>\n\n[[Section Twenty-one of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 21]] ensured that the new Charter of Rights and Freedoms would be read as supplementing, rather than replacing any rights of the English and French languages, which had been constitutionalized prior to 1982. [[Section Twenty-two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 22]] ensured that the new Charter of Rights and Freedoms would not be interpreted by the courts as placing any new restrictions on non-official languages.\n\n===Education Rights (section 23 of the Charter and section 59 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'')===\nSection 23 provides a limited right to receive publicly funded primary and secondary-schooling in the two official languages when they are \"in a minority situation\"\u2014in other words, to English-language schooling in Quebec, and to French-language schooling in the rest of the country.\n\n====Asymmetrical application of education rights in Quebec versus elsewhere in Canada====\nThe right applies asymmetrically because section 59 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', provides that not all of the language rights listed in section 23 will apply in Quebec. Specifically:\n*In Quebec, a child may receive free public education in English only if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in English.\n*In the rest of Canada, a child may receive free public education in French if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in French, or if at least one parent has French as his or her [[First language|mother tongue]] (defined in section 23 as \"first language learned and still understood\").\nNone of these education language rights precludes parents from placing their children in a private school (which they pay for) in the language of their choice; it applies only to subsidized public education.\n\nOne practical consequence of this asymmetry is that all migrants who arrive in Quebec from foreign countries only have access to French-language public schools for their children. This includes immigrants whose mother tongue is English and immigrants who received their schooling in English. On the other hand, Section 23 provides a nearly universal right to English-language schooling for the children of Canadian-born anglophones living in Quebec.\n\nSection 23 also provides, subject only to the \"where numbers warrant\" restriction, a right to French-language schooling for the children of all francophones living outside Quebec, including immigrants from French-speaking countries who settle outside Quebec, and who are Canadian citizens.\n\nHowever, admission to French-language schools outside Quebec remains restricted in some ways it is not in Quebec. In particular, rights holder parents who choose to enroll their child in English school may thereby deprive that child's descendants of the right to attend French school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elfontario.ca/en/admission-criteria.html |title=French Education System Admission Criteria &#124; Fle |publisher=Elfontario.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref> In Quebec, under article 76.1 of the ''Charter of the French Language'', rights holders do not deprive their descendants of the right to an English-language education by choosing to enroll their children in French school. (This applies if certain administrative steps are taken at each generation. Otherwise, the right may still be transmitted to grandchildren under article 76.)\n\nAnother element of asymmetry between Quebec and most anglophone provinces is that while Quebec provides public English-language primary and secondary education throughout the province, most other provinces provide French-language education only \"where numbers warrant\".\n\n====Additional restrictions on education rights====\nThere are some further restrictions on minority-language education rights:\n#The rights attach to the parent, not the child, and non-citizens residing in Canada do not have access to this right (even if their children are born in Canada).\n#If the parents' English-language or French-language education took place outside Canada, this does not entitle the child to be educated in that language.\n#The right to receive public funding can only be exercised in localities where \"...the number of children of citizens who have such a right is sufficient to warrant the provision to them out of public funds....\"<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Department of Justice Canada|date=1982-04-17|title=Canadian charter of rights and freedoms: Minority Language Educational Rights|url=http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/const_en.html#instruction}}</ref>\n\n====Ambiguous definition of entitlement to education rights====\nThe phrase, \"where numbers ... warrant\" is not defined in Section 23. Education is under provincial jurisdiction, which means that it has not been possible for Parliament to enact a single nationwide definition of the term, as the 1988 ''Official Languages Act'' did for the constitutional obligation to provide federal services where \u201cthere is a sufficient demand.\u201d As a result, disputes over the extent of the right to a publicly funded minority-language education have been the source of much litigation.\n\nThe defining case was ''[[Mahe v. Alberta]]'' (1990), in which the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] declared that section 23 guaranteed a \"sliding scale\". In certain circumstances, the children whose parents could exercise the right might be so few that literally no minority language education may be provided by the government. With a greater number of children, some schools might be required to provide [[classroom]]s in which the children could receive minority language education. An even greater number would require the [[construction]] of new schools dedicated solely to minority language education. More recent cases, which have significantly extended these rights, include ''[[Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island]]'' (2000) and ''[[Doucet-Boudreau v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Education)]]'' (2003).\n\n===Language of the official text of the Constitution===\nMany of the documents in Canada's Constitution do not have an official French-language version; for legal purposes only the English-language version is official and any French translations are unofficial. In particular, the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'' (which created Canada as a legal entity and still contains the most important provisions of governmental powers) has no official French-language version, because it was enacted by the United Kingdom Parliament, which functions in the English language exclusively. Similarly, all other parts of the Constitution that were enacted by the United Kingdom (with the important exception of the ''[[Canada Act 1982]]'') have no official French-language version.\n\nSections 55\u201357 of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' set out a framework for changing this situation. Section 55 calls for French versions of all parts of the Constitution that exist only in English to be prepared as quickly as possible. Section 56 provided that, following adoption of the French versions, both the English-language and French-language versions would be equally authoritative. To avoid the situation where an inaccurately translated French version would have a weight equal to the English original, Section 55 requires that the French-language versions be approved using the same process under which actual constitutional amendments are adopted.\n\nPursuant to section 55, a French Constitutional Drafting Committee produced French-language versions of all the British North America Acts in the decade following 1982. However, these versions were never ratified under the Constitution\u2019s amendment procedure, and therefore have never been officially adopted.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/const/loireg/intro.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030923020754/http://www.justice.gc.ca/en/ps/const/loireg/intro.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2003-09-23 | accessdate=2007-12-18 | work=Final Report of the French Constitutional Drafting Committee | title=Introduction }}</ref>\n\nSection 57 states that the \u201cEnglish and French versions of this Act [ie. the ''Constitution Act, 1982''] are equally authoritative.\u201d The purpose of this provision is to clear up any ambiguity that might have existed about the equal status of the two versions as a result of the novel way in which this part of Canada's supreme law came into force. Had the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' been enacted as most preceding amendments to Canada's constitution had been, as a statute of the British parliament, it would, like any other British statute, have been an English-only document. Instead, the British parliament enacted a very concise law, (the ''[[Canada Act 1982]]''), written in English only. The operative clauses of the ''Canada Act, 1982'' simply state that an appendix to the Act (the appendix is formally referred to as a \"schedule\") is to be integrated into the Canadian constitution. The schedule contains the complete text of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', in both English and French.<ref>Schedule 'A' of the ''Canada Act'' is a French version of the operative clauses of the ''Canada Act''. Schedule 'B' contains the text of the ''Constitution Act, 1982'', in both English and French.</ref>\n\n==Federal legislation on official languages==\n===Official Languages Act===\n{{main|Official Languages Act (Canada)}}\n[[File:Government of Canada signature.svg|500px|thumb|right|A bilingual sign in [[Canada]].]]\nCanada adopted its first ''Official Languages Act'' in 1969,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/official-languages-act-1969|title=Official Languages Act (1969)|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=September 9, 2019}}</ref> in response to the recommendations of the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]]. The current ''Official Languages Act'' was adopted in 1988 to improve the 1969 law's efforts to address two basic policy objectives: (1) to specify the powers, duties and functions of federal institutions relevant to official languages; (2) to support the development of linguistic minority communities. As well, following the adoption in 1982 of the ''Charter of Rights'', it was necessary to create a legislative framework within which the Government of Canada could respect its new constitutional

influence on the status of English and French in Canada==\nBook I Chapter 1.C of the report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, published on 8 October 1967, acknowledges the international influence on Canadian language policy:\n{{quote|Compared to other bilingual states \u2013 among them Finland, South Africa, and Belgium, which we shall discuss later \u2013\u00a0Canada is fortunate that her official languages both have international status\u2026\n\nIn Canada, however, one of the two language groups begins with a considerable advantage. As the national language of the United States, one of the most powerful countries of the world, English has a massive preponderance in North America. Thus the English-language group in this country draws much of its strength from the English-speaking population of our neighbour. The French-language group is, on the other hand, a minority on the North American continent and suffers from its isolation not only from France but from the other French speaking peoples of the world.<ref name=\"publications.gc.ca\">{{cite web|url=http://publications.gc.ca/site/archivee-archived.html?url=http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2014/bcp-pco/Z1-1963-1-5-1-1-eng.pdf|title=Information archiv\u00e9e dans le Web|website=publications.gc.ca}}</ref>}}\n\n==Official bilingualism in the public service==\n{{main|Official bilingualism in the public service of Canada}}\nThe issue of proportional hiring and promotion of speakers of both official languages has been an issue in Canadian politics since before Confederation. Members of each linguistic group have complained of injustice when their group have been represented, in public service hiring and promotion, in numbers less than would be justified by their proportion of the national population. For the greater part of Canada\u2019s history, French-speakers were underrepresented, and English-speakers were overrepresented in the ranks of the public service, and the disproportion became more pronounced in the more senior ranks of public servants. However, this trend has reversed itself in recent decades.\n\nThe first high-profile complaint of preferential hiring took place in 1834. One of the [[Ninety-Two Resolutions]] of the [[Lower Canada|Lower Canadian]] House of Assembly drew attention to the fact that French Canadians, who at the time were 88% of the colony's population, held only 30% of the posts in the 157-member colonial civil service. Moreover, the resolution stated, French Canadians were, \"for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those [British immigrants] who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices....\"<ref>Resolution 75. Resolved, That the number of the Inhabitants of the country being about 600,000, those of French origin are about 525,000, and those of British or other origin 75,000; and that the establishment of the civil government of Lower Canada, for the year 1832, accordingly to the yearly returns made by the Provincial Administration, for the information of the British Parliament, contained the names of 157 officers and others receiving salaries, who are apparently of British or foreign origin and the names of 47 who are, apparently, natives of the country, of French origin; that this statement does not exhibit the whole disproportion which exists in the distribution of the public money and power, the latter class being, for the most part, appointed to the inferior and less lucrative offices, and most frequently only obtaining even them, by becoming the dependent of those who hold the higher and the more lucrative offices; that the accumulation of many of the best paid and most influential, and at the same time incompatible, offices in the same person, which is forbidden by the laws and by sound policy, exists especially for the benefit of the former class; and that two-thirds of the persons included in the last commission of the peace issued in the province, are apparently of British or foreign origin, and one-third only of French origin.</ref>\n\nWith the advent of [[responsible government]] in the 1840s, the power to make civil service appointments was transferred to elected politicians, who had a strong incentive to ensure that French Canadian voters did not feel that they were being frozen out of hiring and promotions. Although no formal reform of the hiring and promotion process was ever undertaken, the patronage-driven hiring process seems to have produced a more equitable representation of the two language groups. In the period between 1867 and the turn of the Twentieth Century, French-Canadians made up about one-third of the Canadian population, and seem also to have represented about one-third of civil service appointments at junior levels, although they had only about half that much representation at the most senior level.<ref>[[Eugene Forsey]] writes: \u201cIn the Dominion Civil Service, C\u00f4t\u00e9\u2019s \u2018\u2019Political Appointments\u2019\u2019, 1867\u20131895, shows that, over that period, eliminating duplications, the French Canadians had rather over a third of the official of the House and of the two Dominion Courts; rather less than a third of other officials of the rank of Deputy Minister and, of the officials from Chief Clerk up to Deputy Minister rather less than one-seventh.\u201d\nSource\u2014Eugene Forsey, \u2018\u2019Freedom and Order: Collected Essays.\u2019\u2019 Ottawa: Carleton University Press, 1974, p. 243.</ref>\n\n==Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories==\n{{main|Language policies of Canada's provinces and territories}}\n\nCanada's thirteen provinces and territories have adopted widely diverging policies with regard to minority-language services for their respective linguistic minorities. Given the wide range of services, such as policing, health care and education, that fall under provincial jurisdiction, these divergences have considerable importance.\n\n===New Brunswick===\nOf Canada's ten provinces, only one ([[New Brunswick]]) has voluntarily chosen to become officially bilingual. New Brunswick's bilingual status is constitutionally entrenched under the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]''. Sections 16\u201320 of the ''Charter'' include parallel sections guaranteeing the same rights at the federal level and at the provincial level (New Brunswick only).\n*Section 16(2) is a largely symbolic statement that \"English and French are the official languages of New Brunswick\" with \"equality of status\".\n*Section 17(2) guarantees the right to use English or French in the New Brunswick legislature\n*Section 18(2) states that New Brunswick's laws will be bilingual, with both texts equally authoritative, and that official publications will be bilingual.\n*Section 19(2) guarantees the right to use either official language in all New Brunswick court proceedings.\n*Section 20(2) guarantees the right to receive provincial government services in either official language.\n\n===Manitoba===\nManitoba is the only province that was officially bilingual at the time of its establishment.\nFollowing the [[Red River Rebellion]] led by the Francophone [[M\u00e9tis]] [[Louis Riel]], the [[Manitoba Act]] was passed, creating the province and mandating the equal status of English and French in all legislative bodies, legislative records, laws and court proceedings.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Parliament of Canada|date=12 May 1870|title=Manitoba Act, 1870|url=http://www.solon.org/Constitutions/Canada/English/ma_1870.html}}</ref> At this time, Manitoba

the protests of Franco-Manitobans that the Manitoba Act had been violated, Manitoba remained monolingual in practice until the early 1980s, when legal challenges created a crisis that threatened to

As well, the province is obliged, under Section 133 of the Constitution Act, 1867, to allow the provincial legislature to operate in both French and English, and to allow all Quebec courts to operate in both languages. Section 23 of the Charter applies to Quebec, but to a more limited degree than in other provinces. Quebec is required to provide an education in English to all children whose Canadian citizen parents were educated in English in Canada, while all other provinces are required to provide an education in French to the children of Canadian citizen parents who either received their education in French in Canada or whose native tongue is French.\n\nIn 1977, the [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] government of [[Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9vesque]] introduced the ''[[Charter of the French Language]]'' (better known as \"Bill 101\") to promote and preserve the French language in the province, indirectly disputing the federal bilingualism policy. Initially, Bill 101 banned the use of all languages but French on most commercial signs in the province (except for companies with four employees or fewer), but those limitations were later loosened by allowing other languages on signs, as long as the French version is predominant. Bill 101 also requires that children of most immigrants residing in Quebec attend French-language public schools; the children of Canadian citizens who have received their education in Canada in English may attend English-language public schools, which are operated by English-language school boards throughout the province. The controversy over this part of Quebec's language legislation has lessened in recent years as these laws became more entrenched and the public use of French increased.<ref>[http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/langlaws.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209161455/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/quebechistory/readings/langlaws.htm |date=December 9, 2006 }}</ref>\n\nQuebec's language laws have been the subject of a number of legal rulings. In 1988, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled in the case of ''[[Ford v. Quebec (A.G.)]]'' that the commercial sign law provisions of Bill 101, which banned the use of the English language on outdoor signs, were unconstitutional. In 1989, the Quebec National Assembly invoked the [[Section Thirty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|\"Notwithstanding Clause\"]] of the Charter of Rights to set aside enforcement of the court ruling for five years. A UN appeal of the 'McIntyre Case' resulted in a condemnation of Quebec's sign law \u2014 regardless of the legality of the notwithstanding clause under Canadian law. In response, in 1993 Quebec enacted amendments to the sign law, availing itself of the suggestions proposed in the losing 1988 Supreme Court ruling by allowing other languages on commercial signs, subject to French being ''markedly predominant'' .\n\nOn March 31, 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled unanimously that the interpretation made by the provincial administration of the \"major part\" criterion in Quebec's ''language of instruction'' provisions violated the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]. This criterion allows students who have completed the \"major part\" of their primary education in English in Canada to continue their studies in English in Quebec. The Court did not strike down the law but, as it had done in its 1988 ruling on sign laws, presented the province with a set of criteria for interpreting the law in conformity with the ''Charter of Rights'', broadening the interpretation of the phrase \"major part\".\n\n===Territories===\nFrench and English are official languages in Canada's three federal territories: [[Yukon]], [[Nunavut]], and the [[Northwest Territories]]. Nunavut and the Northwest Territories also accord official language status to several indigenous languages. [[Inuktitut]] and [[Inuinnaqtun]] are official languages in Nunavut because of the territory's [[Inuit]] population. The Northwest Territories accords official status to nine aboriginal languages ([[Chipewyan language|Chipewyan]], [[Cree language|Cree]], [[Gwich\u2019in language|Gwich\u2019in]], Inuinnaqtun, Inuktitut, [[Inuvialuktun]], [[Slavey language|North Slavey]], [[Slavey language|South Slavey]] and [[Dogrib language|T\u0142\u012fch\u01eb/Dogrib]]). NWT residents have the right to use any of the territory's eleven official languages in a territorial court and in debates and proceedings of the legislature. However, laws are legally binding only in their French and English versions, and the government publishes laws and other documents in the territory's other official languages only when asked by the legislature. Furthermore, access to services in any language is limited to institutions and circumstances where there is significant demand for that language or where it is reasonable to expect it given the nature of the services requested. In practice, this means that only English language services are universally available, and there is no guarantee that any particular government service will use other languages except the courts. Following a 2006 territorial supreme court ruling, ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Franco-T\u00e9noise v. Canada (Attorney General)'', universal French-language services are also mandatory.\n\nThis is despite the fact that the proportion of native French-speakers in the territories is negligible, and they are vastly outnumbered by speakers of indigenous languages. At the 2016 census, there were 1,455 \"mother-tongue\" speakers of French in Yukon (4.3%), 1,175 in the Northwest Territories (2.9%), and 595 in Nunavut (1.7%).<ref>2016 Canadian census data</ref>\n\n===Elsewhere in Canada===\n[[File:Tim hortons ualbany.jpg|thumb|The comments box in both French and English at the now-defunct Tim Hortons store in the [[University at Albany, State University of New York|SUNY Albany]] campus center.<ref>https://exhibitions.nysm.nysed.gov/albany/bios/french.html</ref>]]\nAlthough no Canadian province has officially adopted English as its sole official language, English is the de facto language of government services and internal government operations in Canada's seven remaining provinces. Service levels in French vary greatly from one province to another (and sometimes within different parts of the same province).\n\nFor example, under the terms of Ontario's 1986 ''[[French Language Services Act]]'', Francophones in 25 designated areas across the province\u2014but not in other parts of the province\u2014are guaranteed access to provincial government services in French. Similarly, since 2005, the City of Ottawa has been officially required under Ontario law,<ref>[http://www.ontla.on.ca/documents/Bills/38_Parliament/Session1/b163_e.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314091619/http://www.ontla.on.ca/documents/Bills/38_Parliament/Session1/b163_e.htm |date=March 14, 2005 }}</ref> to set a municipal policy on English and French.\n\nIn Alberta, the ''[[Alberta School Act]]'' protects the right of French-speaking people to receive school instruction in the French language in the province.\n\n==Language rights in the legal system==\nThere is considerable variation across Canada concerning the right to use English and French in legislatures and courts (federal, provincial and territorial).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clo-ocol.gc.ca/en/language_rights/provinces_territories|title=Official languages in the provinces and territories|first=Web Experience|last=Toolkit|date=23 March 2014|website=www.clo-ocol.gc.ca}}</ref>  Rights under federal law are consistent throughout Canada, but different provinces and territories have different approaches to language rights.  Three provinces (Manitoba, New Brunswick and Quebec) have constitutional guarantees for bilingualism and language rights.  Three other provinces (Alberta, Ontario and Saskatchewan) have statutory provisions relating to bilingualism in the legal system, as do each of the three territories (Northwest Territories, Nunavut and Yukon).  Four provinces (British Columbia, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island) are unilingual English.\n\nLanguage rights in the legal system are summarized in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

This distinction was articulated in the 1967 report of the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]], which stated:\n{{cquote|A bilingual country is not one where all the inhabitants necessarily have to speak two languages; rather it is a country where the principal public and private institutions must provide services in two languages to the citizens, the vast majority of whom may well be unilingual.\"<ref>Report of the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism, Book I (General Introduction), Ottawa: Queen's Printer, p. xxviii, at paragraph 29.</ref>}} Nonetheless, the promotion of personal bilingualism in English and French is an important objective of official bilingualism in Canada.\n\nAt least 35% of [[Canadians]] speak more than one language. Moreover, fewer than 2% of Canadians cannot speak at least one of the two official languages.<ref>Statistics Canada, 2006 Census Profile of Federal Electoral Districts (2003 Representation Order): Language, Mobility and Migration and Immigration and Citizenship. Ottawa, 2007, p. 6, line 108. In 2006, Canada\u2019s population was 31,241,030. Of this, 520,385 Canadians, or 1.7%, did not speak either official language.</ref> However, of these multilingual Canadians, somewhat less than one fifth of the population (5,448,850 persons, or 17.4% of the Canadian population) are able to maintain a conversation in both of the official languages according to a self-assessment.<ref>Statistics Canada, 2006 Census Profile of Federal Electoral Districts (2003 Representation Order): Language, Mobility and Migration and Immigration and Citizenship. Ottawa, 2007, pp. 2, 6. Statistics Canada collects data on mother tongue, on \"first official language spoken\", and on bilingualism in French and English. However, the agency does not collect data on bilingualism in non-official languages (either persons who speak more than one non-official language, or who have an official language as their mother tongue and afterwards learn a non-official language). Thus, it is possible only to determine that 6,147,840 Canadians have a non-official language as their mother tongue (see p. 2, line 5), and that 520,385 Canadians do not speak either official language (see p. 6, line 108). Since all persons who speak neither official language must have a non-official language as their mother tongue, simple subtraction shows that 5,627,455 Canadians, or 18.0% of the population, are bilingual in a non-official language plus an official language.</ref> However, in Canada the terms \"bilingual\" and \"unilingual\" are normally used to refer to bilingualism in English and French. In this sense, nearly 83% of Canadians are ''unilingual''.\n\nKnowledge of the two official languages is largely determined by geography. Nearly 95% of Quebecers can speak French, but only 40.6% speak English. In the rest of the country, 97.6% of the population is capable of speaking English, but only 7.5% can speak French.<ref>Statistics Canada, 2006 Census Profile of Federal Electoral Districts (2003 Representation Order): Language, Mobility and Migration and Immigration and Citizenship. Ottawa, 2007, pp. 6, 60.</ref> Personal bilingualism is most concentrated in southern Quebec and a swath of territory sometimes referred to as the ''[[bilingual belt]]'', which stretches east from Quebec through northern and eastern New Brunswick and west through [[Ottawa]] and that part of Ontario lying to the east of Ottawa, as well as north-eastern Ontario. There is also a large [[Franco-Manitobans|French-speaking population]] in Manitoba. In all, 55% of bilingual Canadians are Quebecers,<ref>Statistics Canada, ''Population by knowledge of official language, by province or territory (2006 Census), http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo15-eng.htm. The 2006 census shows that 3017,860 Quebecers are bilingual, out of a total of 5,448,850 bilingual Canadians.</ref> and a high percentage of the bilingual population in the rest of Canada resides in Ontario and New Brunswick. Statistics Canada collects much of its language data from self-assessments.\n\n==Second-language education==\n{{main|Bilingual education}}\n\nCanada\u2019s thirteen provincial and territorial education systems place a high priority on boosting the number of bilingual high school graduates. For example, in 2008 New Brunswick's provincial government reconfirmed its goal of boosting the percentage of bilingualism among graduates from its current rate of 34% to 70% rate by 2012.<ref>See Jesse Robichaud, \"Keep parents involved in language education: Lord,\" in the Moncton Times and Transcript, February 21, 2008, and Daniel McHardie, \"Language battle: Education Minister will seek public input before responding to French Second Language Review,\" in New Brunswick Telegraph-Journal, February 28, 2008, p.

In Quebec and New Brunswick, French classes begin in Grade 1. In the other provinces, French classes typically start in Grade 4 or 5. Students normally receive about 600 hours of French-language classes by the time of graduation.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071111142812/http://www.cpfnb.com/core_FAQ/CoreFAQ.html Miles Turnbull, \"Core French in Canada\", Canadian Parents for French (Wayback machine).]</ref> The goal of \u201cCore French\u201d programs is not to produce fully bilingual graduates, but rather \"to provide students with the ability to communicate adequately in the second language, and to provide students with linguistic tools to continue their second-language studies by building on a solid communicative base\".<ref>New Brunswick Department of Education, ''Policy Statement on Immersion and the Core Program''. Fredericton, 1983, p. xii.</ref> There are no mandatory core French class in British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan, and second-language courses are  mandatory only in BC.\n\nOne result of this is that comprehension levels are often lower than parents would prefer. A scholar who interviewed a former New Brunswick premier, as well as the province's deputy ministers of education and health and the chairman of its Board of Management and Official Languages Branch reports: \"[A]ll expressed reservations about the effectiveness of the Core program in promoting individual bilingualism and believed the program must be improved if anglophone students are to obtain a level of proficiency in the French language.\"<ref>Catherine Steele, ''Can Bilingualism Work?

In this program, at least 25% of all instruction must be in French. From Grades 4 through 8, this means that at least one course per year other than \"French as a Second Language\" must be taught solely in French. From Grades 9 through 12, along with taking the Extended French language course every year, students must complete their mandatory Grade 9 [[Geography]] and Grade 10 [[Canadian History]] credits in French. Students who complete these required courses and take one extra credit taught in French receive a [[wikt:certificate|certificate]] upon graduation in addition to their [[Ontario Secondary School Diploma|diploma]].\n\n====Intensive French====\nIntensive French is a method of FSL education that originated in Newfoundland. \nIn 2004, Intensive French began in some schools in British Columbia. Intensive French is a choice program (in offering schools) during the grade 6 year. For the first five months of the school year students spend 80% of their time learning French, with the other 20% being for math. The rest of the core curriculum (Social Studies, Science, and Language Arts in English) is condensed for the second half of the year, comprising 80% of the time, with one hour for French.

In the 1960s, a decade that interpreter Ronald Despr\u00e9s called the \u201cgolden age of simultaneous interpretation,\u201d it was not unusual for interpreters to put in 80-hour weeks. Marguerite Ouimet said that she spent more time in a booth than at home, as did many of her colleagues. From the mid-1970s onward, technician Jean-Pierre Dulude, whose outstanding skill was widely recognized in interpretation circles, supervised the installation of some 60 interpreters\u2019 booths on Parliament Hill, and in federal departments and buildings across the country. He took great care to ensure that the booths met national standards.\u2019<ref>{{Citation |last=Delisle |first=Jean |title=Fifty Years of Parliamentary Interpretation |url=http://revparl.ca/32/2/32n2_09e_Delisle.pdf |work=Canadian Parliamentary Review |pages=27\u201332 |publication-date=2009}}</ref>\n\nThe article goes on to state:\n\n\u2018The House cannot sit without interpreters and it has adjourned when the interpretation system experienced technical difficulties.\u2019\n\nA report of the Advisory Working Group on the Parliamentary Translation Services of the Standing Committee on Internal Economy, Budgets and Administration revealed on 15 March 2018:\n\n\u2018Many of the respondents cited inconsistency and quality control as major issues when it came to translation. The quality of the service varies greatly from one translator to another and there are often errors in the translations even when a request for a secondary review is made. Some respondents noted that the two language versions of committee reports often do not convey the same meaning and that, in some cases, the translation is simply erroneous. Much time is reportedly spent by senators and staff reviewing the documents in question and ensuring that the translation is accurate. Other respondents reported that longer documents that had been translated by more than one individual were disjointed and difficult to read because a common style had not been used. Recommendations ranged from the need to hire specialized translators to facilitate the translation of committee reports on technical matters, to ensuring proper revision of translations before their delivery, and to the need to provide for a feedback mechanism that could be used to alert the Translation Bureau when errors were detected.\n\n\u2018Issues related to the quality of interpretation were also raised. Some senators reported hearing literal translations that did not convey the true meaning of what the speaker had said. Others noted that regional expressions were not properly interpreted. Many respondents asked if it would be possible to have the same interpreters covering the Chamber and specific committees as this would ensure continuity. The need to upgrade the Senate's technological equipment was raised as devices in some committee rooms did not work properly. Some committee clerks noted that a more modern way for clerks to provide material to the interpreters was needed. Such technological upgrades could make communication of information quicker and more efficient.\u2019<ref name=\"sencanada.ca\"/>\n\n===Direct monetary cost of official bilingualism===\nIn Official Language Policies of the Canadian Provinces: Costs and Benefits in 2006, published by the Fraser Institute in 2012, we read on page xii:\n\n\u2018In our previous study, Official Language Policies at the Federal Level in Canada: Costs and Benefits in 2006, we estimated that the total cost of federal bilingualism at $1.8 billion. Since these expenditures include transfers to provinces that are spent by them on official language programs (Vaillancourt and Coche, 2009: 25, table 1), aggregating federal, provincial, and local spending must net out these transfers to avoid double counting.

Among Francophones, polls have revealed no such reservations.\n\nAmong Anglophones, support for providing federal French-language services to French-speakers living outside Quebec has remained consistently high over a quarter-century period\u201479% in 1977 and 76% in 2002.<ref>Andrew Parkin and Andre Turcotte, ''Bilingualism: Part of Our Past or Part of Our Future?''.

A parallel question, \"Are you in favour of bilingualism for your province?\" also received a much more favourable response from Francophone respondents (most of whom were located in Quebec) than from Anglophone respondents, indicating that Francophones were consistently more supportive than Anglophones of a fully bilingual Quebec within a fully bilingual Canada, whereas Anglophones were consistently more supportive than Francophones of a unilingual French Quebec within a Canada where the other provinces are for the most part unilingual English.</ref> The ebb in support for bilingualism among anglophones can likely be attributed to political developments in the late 1980s and 1990s, including the failure of the [[Meech Lake Accord]], and the 1995 referendum on Quebec independence.<ref name=\"ocol-clo1\"/>\n\nBy 2006, affirmative responses to the question \"Are you personally in favour of bilingualism for all of Canada?\" had increased considerably, with 72% of Canadians (and 64% of anglophones) agreeing. 70% of Canadians, and 64% of anglophones were \"in favour of bilingualism for [their] province\".<ref name=\"ocol-clo1\"/> Support for bilingualism is thought likely to continue to increase, as young anglophones are more favourable to it than their elders.<ref name=\"ocol-clo1\"/>\n\nAccording to Turcotte and Parkin, other poll data reveal that \"in contrast to Francophones, Anglophones, in general, have resisted putting more government effort and resources into promoting bilingualism&nbsp;... What is revealing, however, is that only 11% of those outside Quebec said they disagreed with bilingualism in any form. Opposition seems to be directed to the actions of the federal government, rather than to bilingualism itself&nbsp;... [T]his distinction is key to understanding public opinion on the issue.\"<ref>Parkin and Turcotte, p. 10. The specific reference is to a 1977 poll in which 54% of non-Quebecers but only 34% of Quebecers identified with the statement, \"I generally agree with or support the principle of bilingualism but I disagree with the form bilingualism has taken under the present federal government.\"</ref> This helps to explain results that would otherwise seem contradictory, such as a 1994 poll in which 56% of Canadians outside Quebec indicated that they either strongly or moderately supported official bilingualism, but 50% agreed with a statement that \"the current official bilingualism policy should be scrapped because it's expensive and inefficient.\"<ref>Angus Reid Group, \"The National Angus Reid/Southam News Poll: Canadians' Views on Official Bilingualism\". Release date: April 29, 1994.</ref>\n\nIn English Canada, there is some regional variation in attitudes towards federal bilingualism policy, but it is relatively modest when compared to the divergence between the views expressed by Quebecers and those expressed in the rest of the country. For example, in a poll conducted in 2000, only 22% of Quebecers agreed with the statement, \u201cWe have gone too far in pushing bilingualism,\u201d while positive response rates in English Canada ranged from a low of 50% in the Atlantic to a high of 65% in the Prairies.<ref>Parkin and Turcotte, p. 11.</ref>\n\nBoth French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians tend to regard the capacity to speak the other official language as having cultural and economic value,<ref>Parkin and Turcotte, pp. 20\u201321.</ref> and both groups have indicated that they regard bilingualism as an integral element of the Canadian national identity. Once again, however, there is a marked divergence between the responses of French-speaking and English-speaking Canadians. In a 2003 poll, 75% of Francophones indicated that \"having two official languages, English and French\" made them proud to be Canadian. Among English-speakers, 55% said that bilingualism made them proud, but far higher percentages (86% and 94%, respectively) indicated that multiculturalism and the Charter of Rights made them feel proud.<ref>Parkin and Turcotte, p. 13.</ref>\n\n===Findings of Public Hearings===\nFrom time to time, boards or panels are commissioned, either by the federal government or the government of one of the provinces, to conduct hearings into the public\u2019s views on matters of policy. Some of these hearings have dealt largely, or even primarily, with official languages policy, and the responses that they have collected provide snapshots into the state of public opinion at particular points in time.\n\n====Findings of the public hearings into the Poirier-Bastarache Report (1985)====\nThe ''Advisory Committee on the Official Languages of New Brunswick'' was commissioned by the provincial legislature as a way of determining the response of the population to the 1982 Poirier-Bastarache Report, which had recommended a considerable expansion of French-language services.<ref>New Brunswick. Official Languages Branch (Bernard Poirier and Michel Bastarache). ''Towards Equality of Official Languages in New Brunswick.'' 1982.</ref> Public hearings were conducted in twelve cities and towns across the province in 1985, and a report was submitted by the committee in 1986.<ref>New Brunswick (Irene Grant-Guerette and Lloyd B. Smith). Report of the Advisory Committee on Official Languages of New Brunswick. 1986.</ref>\n\nThe briefs submitted to the Advisory Committee were subsequently summarized in an academic study of the hearings in the following terms:\n\n{{cquote|Qualitative analysis illustrate[s] that, as the majority, anglophones are reticent about extending opportunities and services to the francophone minority for fear of placing themselves at a disadvantage, whether it be in the education system or civil service employment. Francophones, as the minority, resent the anglophone hesitancy to make available rights and privileges secured under the Official Languages Act of New Brunswick of 1969 and the Constitution Act (1982)&nbsp;... They favour their own schools, control over their education, increased access to civil service positions and services in their own language through separate institutions and administrations.<ref>Catherine Steele, ''Can Bilingualism Work? Attitudes Towards Language Policy in New Brunswick: The 1985 Public Hearings on the Poirier-Bastarache Report''. Fredericton: New Ireland Press, 1990, p. 89.</ref>}}\n\n====Findings of the Spicer Commission (1990)====\nIn late 1990, a six-man ''Citizens\u2019 Forum on Canada\u2019s Future'' was established by the federal government with a mandate to engage in \"a dialogue and discussion with and among Canadians&nbsp;... to discuss the values and characteristics fundamental to the well-being of Canada\". The Forum, which was headed by former Commissioner of Official Languages Keith Spicer, published a report in June 1991, which included a detailed discussion of Canadians\u2019 reactions to a variety of issues, including federal official languages policy.\n\nThese comments, which probably represent the most extensive consultation ever with Canadians on the subject of official bilingualism, were compiled statistically by the Spicer Commission, and tend to reinforce the findings of pollsters, that Canadians are favourable towards bilingual services, but frustrated with the implementation of official languages policy. Thus, for example, nearly 80% of group discussions sponsored by the Commission produced favourable comments from participants on what the Commission's report refers to as \"bilingualism generally\", but nearly 80% of these discussions produced negative comments on \"official languages policy\".<ref>Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future, Report to the People and Government of Canada. Ottawa: Minister of Supply and Services, 1991, p. 161.</ref>\n\nThese results prompted Spicer to write,\n\n{{cquote|Canada's use of two official languages is widely seen as a fundamental and distinctive Canadian characteristic. Among many, especially the young, the ability to speak, read and write both French and English is accepted as a significant personal advantage. Even many parents who dislike \"official bilingualism\" are eager to enrol their children in French immersion.\n\nOn the other hand, we find that the application of the official languages policy is a major irritant outside Quebec, and not much appreciated inside Quebec&nbsp;... In spite of real and needed progress in linguistic fair play in federal institutions, a sometimes mechanical, overzealous, and unreasonably costly approach to the policy has led to decisions to that have helped bring it into disrepute. Citizens tell us that bilingual bonuses, costly translation of technical manuals of very limited use, public servants' low use of hard-acquired French-language training, excessive designation of bilingual jobs, and a sometimes narrow, legalistic approach are sapping a principle they would otherwise welcome as part of Canada's basic identity.<ref>Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future, Report, pp. 125\u2013126.</ref>}}\n\n===Advocacy groups===\n;Advocacy in support of expanding / extending official bilingualism exclusively of other language communities\nA number of groups exist, which, as part of their mandate, seek to promote official bilingualism or to extend the scope of the policy (although advocacy is not always the sole, or even the primary activity, of the groups). Among these groups:\n*'''[[Alliance Quebec]]''' (defunct)\n* '''L'Association des municipalit\u00e9s francophones du Nouveau-Brunswick '''\n* '''Canadian Parents for French''', established with the assistance of the Commissioner of Official Languages in 1977, promotes French second-language education for children whose mother tongue is English;\n*'''Commission nationale des parents francophones'''\n*'''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des communaut\u00e9s francophones et acadienne du Canada''' serves as an umbrella for 22 groups representing French-speaking minorities in different provinces and territories;\n*'''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration des jeunes francophones du Nouveau-Brunswick'''\n*'''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration nationale des conseils scolaires francophones'''\n*'''[[Francophone Association of Municipalities of Ontario]]''' seeks to oversee the maintenance and development of municipal government services in French, in Ontario municipalities with French-speaking populations.\n*'''Imp\u00e9ratif fran\u00e7ais''' seeks to promote the use of French within Quebec, and to challenge inequalities between the languages that may arise within areas of federal administration.\n*'''Quebec Community Groups Network''' serves as an umbrella for 38 English language community organizations across Quebec for the purposes of supporting and assisting the development and enhancing the vitality of the English-speaking minority communities;\n* '''Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Acadiens et Acadiennes du Nouveau-Brunswick'''\n\n;Advocacy in favour of restraining or abolishing official bilingualism\nA number of groups have existed, since the first ''[[Official Languages Act (Canada)|Official Languages Act]]'' was proclaimed in 1969, which sought to end official bilingualism or to reduce the scope of the policy. Among these groups:\n*'''The [[Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada]]''' (often referred to as \"APEC\"). In 2000, the group was renamed '''Canadians Against Bilingualism Injustice'''.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Canada Gazette|date=2000-02-26|title=Alliance for the Preservation of English in Canada: Change of name and relocation of head office|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2000/2000-02-26/html/misc-divers-eng.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204145821/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2000/2000-02-26/html/misc-divers-eng.html|archivedate=2012-02-04}}</ref> In 2001, the organization changed its name again, becoming the '''Canadian Network for Language Awareness'''.;<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Canada Gazette Part I, p. 3872|date=2001-10-06|title=Supplementary letters patent (name change)|url=http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2001/2001-10-06/pdf/g1-13540.pdf|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321014222/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/archives/p1/2001/2001-10-06/pdf/g1-13540.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-21}}</ref>\n*'''[[Canadians for Language Fairness]]''';\n*'''The [[New Brunswick Association of English-speaking Canadians]]''' was formed in 1984 and disbanded in 1986. Its primary purpose was to oppose the proposals of the province's \"Poirier-Bastarache Committee\" for an expansion of the province's policy of official bilingualism.\n\nIn the first decade or so following the 1969 adoption of the Act, opposition to the new policy sometimes took a radical form that has subsequently nearly disappeared. Books such as Jock V. Andrew's ''[[Bilingual Today, French Tomorrow]]'', advocated either the repeal of the ''Official Languages Act'' or an end to the policy of official bilingualism. [[Leonard Jones]], the mayor of [[Moncton]], New Brunswick, was an aggressive opponent of bilingualism in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Jones challenged the validity of the ''Official Languages Act'' in court, arguing that the subject matter was outside the jurisdiction of the federal government. In 1974, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ruled against Jones, and [[Jones v. Attorney General of New Brunswick|found the law constitutional]]. In 1991, a local resurgence in anti-bilingualism sentiments allowed the [[New Brunswick Confederation of Regions Party|Confederation of Regions Party]] to win 21.2% of the vote in New Brunswick's provincial election and to briefly form the [[Opposition (parliamentary)|official opposition]] with eight seats in the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick|provincial legislature]].\n\nSome organizations or individuals within certain movements also propose introducing a more inclusive language policy either via official multilingualism, or an official unilingual language policy in an auxiliary language so as to intrude minimally into the first-language choice of residents. Such ideas are sometimes inspired by Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights relating to discrimination on the basis of language, and Article 26(3) of the same Declaration so as to give parents the freedom \u201cto choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children.\u201d Others can be inspired by religious or other beliefs.\n\n'''Assembly of First Nations''': National First Nations Language Strategy, presented by the Assembly of First Nations on 5 July 2007, inspired by previous statements including the report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples presented in 1996, rejects official bilingualism in favour of linguistic equality for speakers of indigenous languages:\n\n\u201cFirst Nations seek legislated protection via a First Nations Languages Act that would be consistent with First Nations and Government of Canada laws dealing with languages.\u201d\n\n'''The [[French Nation of Canada]] (FRENCA)''': The NAFRAC favours a more interlingual approach to language policy that promotes the local sign language, the local indigenous language, Esperanto or another international auxiliary language, and more linguistic freedom in unofficial domains.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationfrancaiseducanada.com/|title=Accueil &#124; La nation fran\u00e7aise du Canada (NAFRAC)|website=La nation fran\u00e7aise}}</ref>\n\n===Positions of the federal political parties===\n====Language issues currently dividing the parties====\nThe issues on which Canada\u2019s political parties have most recently shown divergent voting patterns are two [[private members\u2019 bills]].\n\nThe first, ''An Act to amend the Official Languages Act (Charter of the French Language)'' (Bill C-482), was introduced by Bloc MP [[Pauline Picard]]. If adopted, it would have had the effect of amending the ''Official Languages Act'', the ''Canada Labour Code'', and the ''Canada Business Corporations Act'', to cause them to conform to the ''[[Charter of the French Language]]'', \u201ceffectively making the federal government French-only in the province,\u201d according to ''[[Maclean\u2019s]]''.<ref>Martin Patriquin, \u201cAre you still here?\u201d ''Maclean\u2019s'', February 25, 2008, p. 23.</ref> This bill was defeated on May 2008, with Bloc and NDP MPs voting in favour and Conservative and Liberal MPs opposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=39&Ses=2&DocId=3499224#T1755 |title=Official Report * Table of Contents * Number 095 (Official Version) |publisher=.parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref>\n\nThe second private member\u2019s bill is NDP MP [[Yvon Godin|Yvon Godin\u2019s]] ''Act to amend the Supreme Court Act (understanding the official languages)'' (Bill C-232). If adopted, this bill will have the effect of blocking any candidate who is not already sufficiently bilingual to understand oral arguments in both official languages from being appointed to the Supreme Court. This bill was passed at third reading on March 31, with all NDP, Liberal and Bloc members in support and all Conservative MPs opposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/HousePublications/Publication.aspx?Language=E&Mode=1&Parl=40&Ses=3&DocId=4402489&File=0#Div-20 |title=Official Report * Table of Contents * Number 021 (Official Version) |publisher=.parl.gc.ca |date= |accessdate=2015-10-29}}</ref> but did not pass the Senate.\n\n====Conservative Party of Canada and its predecessors====\nThe [[Conservative Party of Canada]] was created in 2003 by the merger of the old [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] and the Canadian Alliance. The new party adopted the principles of the old Progressive Conservatives as its founding principles, with only a handful of changes. One of these was the addition of the following founding principle, which is lifted almost verbatim from Section 16(1) of the ''Charter of Rights'':\n\n\"A belief that English and French have equality of status, and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions of the Parliament and Government of Canada.\"\n\nAt its founding convention in 2005, the new party added the following policy to its ''Policy Declaration'' (the official compilation of the policies that it had adopted at the convention):\n\n: \"The Conservative Party believes that Canada\u2019s official languages constitute a unique and significant social and economic advantage that benefit all Canadians.\n\n: \"i) A Conservative Government will support the Official Languages Act ensuring that English and French have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all institutions of the Parliament and Government of Canada.\n\n: \"ii) The Conservative Party will work with the provinces and territories to enhance opportunities for Canadians to learn both official languages.\"<ref>''Conservative Party of Canada Policy Declaration'', March 2005, p. 32 (Policy #91).</ref>\n\nPrior to this, in the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Reform Party of Canada]] had advocated the policy's repeal. However, the party's position moderated with time. By 1999, the ''Blue Book'' (the party's declaration of its then-current policies) stated that \"The Reform Party supports official bilingualism in key federal institutions, such as Parliament and the Supreme Court, and in critical federal services in parts of the country where need is sufficient to warrant services on a cost-effective basis.\"<ref>''The 'Blue Book': Principles and Policy of the Reform Party of Canada \u2013 1999'', p. 40.</ref> By 2002, the policy declaration of the Reform Party's political successor, the [[Canadian Alliance]], had been moderated further, and stated that it was \"the federal government's responsibility to uphold minority rights\" by providing services in both languages in any \"rural township or city neighbourhood where at least ten percent of the local population uses either English or French in its daily life\".<ref>''Canadian Alliance Declaration of Policy'', April 2002, pp. 12\u201313.</ref>\n\n====Liberal Party of Canada====\nThe [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] sees itself as the party of official bilingualism, as it was a Liberal prime minister, [[Pierre Trudeau]], who enacted the first ''Official Languages Act'' in 1969 and who entrenched detailed protections for the two official languages in the ''Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' in 1982.\n\nThe depth of the party\u2019s commitment to official bilingualism is demonstrated by the fact that the constitution of the Liberal Party contains provisions modelled almost word-for-word on [[Section Sixteen of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Section 16(1)]] of the ''Charter of Rights'': \"English and French are the official languages of the Party and have equality of status and equal rights and privileges as to their use in all federal institutions of the Party. In pursuing its fundamental purposes and in all its activities, the Party must preserve and promote the status, rights and privileges of English and French.\"<ref>Liberal Party of Canada, \u201cConstitution\u201d, as adopted and amended at the biennial convention, November 30 \u2013 December 1, 2006, Section 2(3).</ref>\n\n====New Democratic Party====\n[[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democrat]] MPs voted in favour of the 1969 ''Official Languages Act'', the 1988 ''Official Languages Act'', and the protections for the two official languages contained in the ''Charter of Rights''. More recently, the party has edged towards supporting an asymmetrical version of bilingualism. Early in 2008, the party\u2019s languages critic, [[Yvon Godin]], stated that its MPs would vote in favour of a bill, sponsored by the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, which would cause federal institutions to operate on a French-preferred or French-only basis in Quebec.<ref>Yvon Godin, \u201cCommons Debates\u201d (Hansard), February 6, 2008, p. 2691.)</ref>\n\nIn 2017, NDP MP Romeo Saganash spoke forcefully against making Anglo-French bilingualism a requirement for Supreme-Court judges in addition to criticizing official bilingualism generally due to the linguistic barriers it imposes on indigenous candidates.<ref name=\"nationalpost.com\"/>\n\n====Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois====\nAlthough the main objective of the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] is to assist in the secession of Quebec, the party\u2019s parliamentary caucus has maintained an active interest in issues relating to official languages policy (for example, sending MPs to participate in the standing Commons committee on official languages). The party seeks to alter federal language policy, as it applies within Quebec, so as to eliminate the statutory equality of English that is guaranteed under the ''Official Languages Act'' and other federal legislation. In recent years, this has included introducing a private member's bill titled ''An Act to amend the Official Languages Act (Charter of the French Language)'' (better known as Bill C-482), intended to supersede the ''Official Languages Act'' with the ''Charter of the French Language'' for all federally regulated corporations within Quebec, this principle uses an [[asymmetrical]] conception of [[federalism]] in [[Canada]].<ref>https://www.amazon.ca/F\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme-asym\u00e9trique-minorit\u00e9s-linguistiques-nationales/dp/2894232225/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=f\u00e9d\u00e9ralisme&qid=1551722376&s=books&sr=1-6</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Attorney General of Quebec v.

Their rivalry with the Chicago Cardinals, the oldest in the NFL (and a crosstown rival from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out of the first six league titles. During the league's first six years, the Bears lost twice to the [[Canton Bulldogs]] (who took two league titles over that span), and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4\u20134\u20132 against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated the Bears more than a single time. During that span, the Bears posted 34 shutouts.\n\nThe Bears' rivalry with the [[Green Bay Packers]] is one of the oldest and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921 (the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent their signing a particular player, and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Brian |title=Love-Hate Relationship: Bears-Packers Rivalry Always Bittersweet |url=http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ |publisher=Green Bay Packers |date=September 28, 2000 |accessdate=June 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107015852/http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ |archivedate=January 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1924bears.jpg|left|thumb|The 1924 team photo]]The franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing the NFL Championship in {{nfly|1921}} and remaining competitive throughout the decade.

They faced the problem of increased operating costs and flatlined attendance. The Bears would only draw roughly 5,000\u20136,000 fans a game, while a University of Chicago game would draw 40,000\u201350,000 fans a game. By adding top college football draw Red Grange to the roster, the Bears knew that they found something to draw more fans to their games. C.C. Pyle was able to secure a $2,000 per game contract for Grange, and in one of the first games, the Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers, 21\u20130. However, Grange remained on the sidelines while learning the team's plays from Bears quarterback [[Joey Sternaman]]. Later in 1925, The Bears would go on a barnstorming tour, showing off the best football player of the day. 75,000 people paid to see Grange lead the Bears to a 17\u20137 victory over the Los Angeles Tigers, who were a quickly put together team of West Coast college all-stars.

A failed contract talk led to Grange bolting to the AFL's [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]], owned by Pyle. The Bears also lost star quarterback [[Joey Sternaman]], who joined the Chicago Bulls of the AFL. The Bears replaced Grange with Paddy Driscoll, a star football player in his own right. The Bears used the money made from the Grange barn-storming tour to sign the man that replaced him. Grange split his time between making movies and playing football. However, the time was not right to have two competing pro football leagues, and the AFL folded after only one season. Grange would return to the Bears.<ref name=\"ChicagoBears\" />\n\nAfter the financial losses of the {{nfly|1932}} Championship season, Halas' partner Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on for forty seasons, an NFL record.

He became the only person to be involved with the NFL throughout the first 60 years of its existence. He was also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's first induction class in 1963. As the only living founder of the NFL at the February 1970 [[AFL-NFL Merger|merger]] between the NFL and the [[American Football League]], the owners honored Halas by electing him the first President of the [[National Football Conference]], a position that he held until his death in 1983.

His gritty personality earned him the nickname \"Iron Mike\". The team reached the NFC Championship game in 1984. In the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985]] season the fire in the Bears\u2013Packers rivalry was re-lit when Ditka used 315 pound defensive tackle [[William Perry (football)|\"Refrigerator\" Perry]] as a running back in a [[touchdown]] play at [[Lambeau Field]], against the Packers. The Bears won their ninth NFL Championship, first since the [[AFL-NFL merger]], in Super Bowl XX after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their then-revolutionary [[46 defense]] and a cast of characters that recorded the novelty rap song \"[[The Super Bowl Shuffle]]\". The season was notable in that the Bears had only one loss, the \"unlucky 13th\" game of the season, a [[Monday Night Football|Monday night]] affair in which they were defeated by the [[Miami Dolphins]]. At the time, much was made of the fact that the {{nfly|1972}} [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] were the only franchise in history to have had an [[perfect season|undefeated season and post-season]]. The Dolphins came close to setting up a rematch in the Super Bowl, but lost to the [[1985 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC title game]]. \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" was videotaped the day after that Monday night loss in Miami.\n\n===1986\u20132003: Post-Super Bowl===\nAfter the 1985 Championship season, the Bears remained competitive throughout the 1980s but failed to return to the [[Super Bowl]] under Ditka. Between the firing of Ditka and the hiring of [[Lovie Smith]], the Bears had two head coaches, [[Dave Wannstedt]] and [[Dick Jauron]]. While both head coaches led the team to the playoffs once (Wannstedt in 1994 and Jauron in 2001), neither was able to accumulate a winning record or bring the Bears back to the Super Bowl. Therefore, the 1990s was largely considered to be a disappointment.\n\nBefore the Bears hired Jauron in January 1999, [[Dave McGinnis]] (Arizona's defensive coordinator, and a former Bears assistant under Ditka and Wannstedt) backed out of taking the head coaching position.

Their rivalry with the Chicago Cardinals, the oldest in the NFL (and a crosstown rival from 1920 to 1959), was key in four out of the first six league titles. During the league's first six years, the Bears lost twice to the [[Canton Bulldogs]] (who took two league titles over that span), and split with their crosstown rival Cardinals (going 4\u20134\u20132 against each other over that span), but no other team in the league defeated the Bears more than a single time. During that span, the Bears posted 34 shutouts.\n\nThe Bears' rivalry with the [[Green Bay Packers]] is one of the oldest and most storied in American professional sports, dating back to 1921 (the Green Bay Packers were an independent team until they joined the NFL in 1921). In one infamous incident that year, Halas got the Packers expelled from the league in order to prevent their signing a particular player, and then graciously got them re-admitted after the Bears had closed the deal with that player.<ref>{{cite web|last=Peterson |first=Brian |title=Love-Hate Relationship: Bears-Packers Rivalry Always Bittersweet |url=http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ |publisher=Green Bay Packers |date=September 28, 2000 |accessdate=June 8, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107015852/http://www.packers.com/news/stories/2000/09/28/1/ |archivedate=January 7, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1924bears.jpg|left|thumb|The 1924 team photo]]The franchise was an early success under Halas, capturing the NFL Championship in {{nfly|1921}} and remaining competitive throughout the decade. In 1924 the Bears claimed the Championship after defeating the [[Cleveland Bulldogs]] on December 7, even putting the title \"World's Champions\" on their 1924 team photo. But the NFL had ruled that games after November 30 did not count towards league standings, and the Bears had to settle for second place behind Cleveland.<ref>{{cite web|title=1924: The Third Time is Charmed |work=PFRA |url=http://footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=1924b |accessdate=February 7, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013105712/http://footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=1924b |archivedate=October 13, 2007 }}</ref> Their only losing season came in {{nfly|1929}}.\n\nDuring the 1920s the club was responsible for triggering the NFL's long-standing rule that a player could not be signed until his college's senior class had graduated. The NFL took that action as a consequence of the Bears' aggressive signing of famous University of Illinois player [[Red Grange]] within a day of his final game as a collegian.<ref>{{cite web|title=Galloping Ghost scared opponents|publisher=ESPN.com|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014213.html|accessdate=December 1, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231152202/http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014213.html|archive-date=December 31, 2005|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nDespite much of the on-field success, the Bears were a team in trouble. They faced the problem of increased operating costs and flatlined attendance. The Bears would only draw roughly 5,000\u20136,000 fans a game, while a University of Chicago game would draw 40,000\u201350,000 fans a game. By adding top college football draw Red Grange to the roster, the Bears knew that they found something to draw more fans to their games. C.C. Pyle was able to secure a $2,000 per game contract for Grange, and in one of the first games, the Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers, 21\u20130. However, Grange remained on the sidelines while learning the team's plays from Bears quarterback [[Joey Sternaman]]. Later in 1925, The Bears would go on a barnstorming tour, showing off the best football player of the day. 75,000 people paid to see Grange lead the Bears to a 17\u20137 victory over the Los Angeles Tigers, who were a quickly put together team of West Coast college all-stars. After a loss to San Francisco, the Bears cruised to a 60\u20133 over a semi-pro team called the Portland All Stars.<ref name=\"ChicagoBears\">{{cite book |last1=Whittingham |first1=Richard |last2=Ditka |first2=Mike |title=The Chicago Bears: From George Halas to Super Bowl XX |isbn=978-0-671-62885-7 |oclc=13795870 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/chicagobearsfrom0000whit }}</ref>\n\nAny hopes that Grange would lead the Bears to glory in 1926 were quickly dashed. A failed contract talk led to Grange bolting to the AFL's [[New York Yankees (NFL)|New York Yankees]], owned by Pyle. The Bears also lost star quarterback [[Joey Sternaman]], who joined the Chicago Bulls of the AFL. The Bears replaced Grange with Paddy Driscoll, a star football player in his own right. The Bears used the money made from the Grange barn-storming tour to sign the man that replaced him. Grange split his time between making movies and playing football. However, the time was not right to have two competing pro football leagues, and the AFL folded after only one season. Grange would return to the Bears.<ref name=\"ChicagoBears\" />\n\nAfter the financial losses of the {{nfly|1932}} Championship season, Halas' partner Dutch Sternaman left the organization. Halas maintained full control of the Bears until his death in 1983. He also coached the team off-and-on for forty seasons, an NFL record. In the [[NFL Playoff Game, 1932|1932 \"Unofficial\" NFL Championship]], the Bears defeated the [[Portsmouth Spartans]] in the first indoor American football game at [[Chicago Stadium]].\n\nThe success of the playoff game led the NFL to institute a championship game. In the very first [[History of NFL Championships|NFL Championship]], the Bears played against the [[New York Giants]], defeating them 23\u201321.

The American television network [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] aired a movie about Piccolo in 1971 entitled ''[[Brian's Song]]'', starring [[James Caan (actor)|James Caan]] and [[Billy Dee Williams]] in the roles of Piccolo and Sayers respectively; [[Jack Warden]] won an [[Emmy Award]] for his performance as Halas. The movie was later released for theater screenings after first being shown on television. Despite Hall of Fame careers, Butkus and Sayers would also have their careers cut short due to injuries, hamstringing the Bears of this era.\n\nHalas retired as coach in [[1967 Chicago Bears season|1967]] and spent the rest of his days in the front office. He became the only person to be involved with the NFL throughout the first 60 years of its existence. He was also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame's first induction class in 1963. As the only living founder of the NFL at the February 1970 [[AFL-NFL Merger|merger]] between the NFL and the [[American Football League]], the owners honored Halas by electing him the first President of the [[National Football Conference]], a position that he held until his death in 1983.

His gritty personality earned him the nickname \"Iron Mike\". The team reached the NFC Championship game in 1984. In the [[1985 Chicago Bears season|1985]] season the fire in the Bears\u2013Packers rivalry was re-lit when Ditka used 315 pound defensive tackle [[William Perry (football)|\"Refrigerator\" Perry]] as a running back in a [[touchdown]] play at [[Lambeau Field]], against the Packers. The Bears won their ninth NFL Championship, first since the [[AFL-NFL merger]], in Super Bowl XX after the 1985 season in which they dominated the NFL with their then-revolutionary [[46 defense]] and a cast of characters that recorded the novelty rap song \"[[The Super Bowl Shuffle]]\". The season was notable in that the Bears had only one loss, the \"unlucky 13th\" game of the season, a [[Monday Night Football|Monday night]] affair in which they were defeated by the [[Miami Dolphins]]. At the time, much was made of the fact that the {{nfly|1972}} [[1972 Miami Dolphins season|Dolphins]] were the only franchise in history to have had an [[perfect season|undefeated season and post-season]]. The Dolphins came close to setting up a rematch in the Super Bowl, but lost to the [[1985 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]] in the [[AFC Championship Game|AFC title game]]. \"The Super Bowl Shuffle\" was videotaped the day after that Monday night loss in Miami.\n\n===1986\u20132003: Post-Super Bowl===\nAfter the 1985 Championship season, the Bears remained competitive throughout the 1980s but failed to return to the [[Super Bowl]] under Ditka. Between the firing of Ditka and the hiring of [[Lovie Smith]], the Bears had two head coaches, [[Dave Wannstedt]] and [[Dick Jauron]]. While both head coaches led the team to the playoffs once (Wannstedt in 1994 and Jauron in 2001), neither was able to accumulate a winning record or bring the Bears back to the Super Bowl. Therefore, the 1990s was largely considered to be a disappointment.\n\nBefore the Bears hired Jauron in January 1999, [[Dave McGinnis]] (Arizona's defensive coordinator, and a former Bears assistant under Ditka and Wannstedt) backed out of taking the head coaching position.

He notes that this slip is normally made only by the English themselves and by foreigners: \"Non-English members of the United Kingdom rarely say 'British' when they mean 'English'\". Kumar suggests that although this blurring is a sign of England's dominant position with the UK, it is also \"problematic for the English [...] when it comes to conceiving of their national identity.

During this period the language and culture of most of what became England changed from [[Romano-British]] to [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]].<ref>The area of [[Lothian]] in modern Scotland was also anglicised in this period, following the conquest of the British \"kingdom\" of [[Manau Gododdin]]. It formed part of the Anglian kingdoms of [[Bernicia]] and [[Northumbria]], only becoming a part of Scotland as late as 1018, when a recent Scottish annexation was recognised by the English. See: Fry, P.S. and Mitchison, R. (1985) ''The History of Scotland'', Routledge, p. 48</ref> The Germanic speakers in Britain, themselves of diverse origins, developed a common cultural identity as [[Anglo-Saxons]] during the mid-fifth to early seventh centuries, after the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|end of Roman power in Britain]] around the year 410. The settlement was followed by the establishment of [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] in the south and east of [[Great Britain|Britain]], later followed by the rest of modern England.\n\nThe available evidence includes the scanty contemporary and near-contemporary written record, and archaeological and genetic information.{{efn| A sample of this discussion can be seen on the television series ''Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain'', particularly the discussion between Francis Pryor and Heinrich H\u00e4rke.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Channel 4|2004}}, Episode 3 ''Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain''.</ref>}} The few literary sources tell of hostility between incomers and natives. They describe violence, destruction, massacre and the flight of the Romano-British population. Moreover, there is little clear evidence for the influence of [[British Celtic]] or [[British Latin]] on the [[Old English]] language. These factors have suggested a very large-scale invasion by various Germanic peoples. In this view, held by the majority of historians until the mid to late 20th century, much of what is now England was cleared of its prior inhabitants, and thus the genes of the later English people would have been overwhelmingly inherited from Germanic migrants.\n\n[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|The [[Incipit]] to Matthew from the [[Book of Lindisfarne]], an Insular masterpiece]]\n\nHowever, another view, probably the most widely held today, is that the migrants were fewer, possibly centred on a warrior elite \u2013 which would suggest that the incomers, having achieved a position of political and social dominance, [[acculturation|acculturated]] the natives to their language and [[material culture]], and intermarried with them to a significant degree. Archaeologists have found that settlement patterns and land use show no clear break with the Romano-British past, though there are marked changes in place names and material culture. This view predicts that the ancestry of the people of Anglo-Saxon and modern England would be largely derived from the native Romano-British. The uncertain results of genetic studies have tended to support both a predominant amount of native British Celtic ancestry, as well as a significant contribution from Anglo-Saxon migrations.\n\nEven so, if these incomers established themselves as a [[social elite]], this could have allowed them enhanced reproductive success (the so-called '[[Apartheid]] Theory'). In this case, the prevalent genes of later [[Anglo-Saxon England]] could have been largely derived from moderate numbers of Germanic migrants.<ref>Brugmann, B.

The multi-ethnic nature of the [[Roman Empire]] meant that small numbers of other peoples may have also been present in England before the Anglo-Saxons arrived. There is archaeological evidence, for example, of an early North African presence in a Roman garrison at [[Aballava]], now [[Burgh-by-Sands]], in Cumbria: a 4th-century inscription says that the Roman military unit ''Numerus Maurorum Aurelianorum'' (\"unit of Aurelian Moors\") from Mauretania (Morocco) was stationed there.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/blackhistorymap/arch.html The archaeology of black Britain], Channel 4.

'English'.</ref> The Norman dynasty ruled England for 87 years until the death of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] in 1154, when the succession passed to [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], [[House of Plantagenet]] (based in France), and England became part of the [[Angevin Empire]] until 1399.\n\nVarious contemporary sources suggest that within 50 years of the invasion most of the Normans outside the royal court had switched to English, with [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] remaining the prestige language of government and law largely out of social inertia. For example, Orderic Vitalis, a historian born in 1075 and the son of a Norman knight, said that he learned French only as a second language. Anglo-Norman continued to be used by the Plantagenet kings until [[Edward I of England|Edward I]] came to the throne.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heritage-history.com/www/heritage.php?Dir=eras&FileName=britain_3.php|website=Heritage History<!-- \u2014 Putting the \"Story\" back into History--> |title =England\u2014Plantagenet Kings|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216064812/http://heritage-history.com/www/heritage.php?Dir=eras&FileName=britain_3.php |archivedate=16 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Over time the English language became more important even in the court, and the Normans were gradually assimilated, until, by the 14th century, both rulers and subjects regarded themselves as English and spoke the English language.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/lang_gallery_04.shtml|title=BBC - History - British History in depth: The Ages of English|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2017-08-21}}</ref>\n\nDespite the assimilation of the Normans, the distinction between 'English' and 'French' survived in official documents long after it had fallen out of common use, in particular in the legal phrase ''[[Presentment of Englishry]]'' (a rule by which a [[Hundred (country subdivision)|hundred]] had to prove an unidentified murdered body found on their soil to be that of an Englishman, rather than a Norman, if they wanted to avoid a fine).

[[Wales]] was [[Annexation|annexed]] by England by the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535\u20131542]], which incorporated Wales into the English state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.ie/~dluby/history.htm|title=Liberation of Ireland|website=Iol.ie|accessdate=23 June 2006}}</ref> A new British identity was subsequently developed when [[James VI of Scotland]] became [[James I of England]] as well, and expressed the desire to be known as the monarch of Britain.<ref>''A History of Britain: The British Wars 1603\u20131776'' by [[Simon Schama]], BBC Worldwide. {{ISBN|0-563-53747-7}}.</ref>\n\nIn 1707, England formed a union with [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]] by passing an [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] in March 1707 that ratified the [[Treaty of Union]]. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] had previously passed its own Act of Union, so the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] was born on 1 May 1707. In 1801, another [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] formed a union between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. In 1922, about two-thirds of the Irish population (those who lived in 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland), left the United Kingdom to form the [[Irish Free State]]. The remainder became the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, although this name was not introduced until 1927, after some years in which the term \"United Kingdom\" had been little used.\n\nThroughout the history of the UK, the English have been dominant in population and in political weight. As a consequence, notions of 'Englishness' and 'Britishness' are often very similar. At the same time, after the Union of 1707, the English, along with the other peoples of the British Isles, have been encouraged to think of themselves as British rather than to identify themselves with the constituent nations.<ref>''The English'', [[Jeremy Paxman]] 1998{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Immigration and assimilation===\n{{See also|Historical immigration to Great Britain|Immigration to the United Kingdom (1922-present day)}}\n\nEngland has been the destination of varied numbers of migrants at different periods from the 17th century onwards.

The modern English language evolved from [[Middle English language|Middle English]] (the form of language in use by the English people from the 12th to the 15th century); Middle English was influenced lexically by Norman-French, Old French and Latin. In the Middle English period Latin was the language of administration and the nobility spoke Norman French. Middle English was itself derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] of the Anglo-Saxon period; in the Northern and Eastern parts of England the language of Danish settlers had influenced the language, a fact still evident in Northern English dialects.\n\nThere were once many different dialects of modern English in England, which were recorded in projects such as the ''[[English Dialect Dictionary]]'' (late 19th century) and the [[Survey of English Dialects]] (mid 20th century), but many of these have passed out of common usage as [[Standard English]] has become more widespread through education, the media and socio-economic pressures.<ref>Wolfgang Vierick (1964), ''Der English Dialect Survey und der Linguistic Survey of Scotland - Arbeitsmethoden und bisherige Ergebnisse'', Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Mundartforschung 31, 333-335 in {{cite book |last=Shorrocks |first=Graham |year=1999 |title=A Grammar of the Dialect of the Bolton Area, Part 1 |location=Frankfurt am Main |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=3-631-33066-9 |page=58}}</ref>\n\n[[Cornish language|Cornish]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], is one of three existing Brythonic languages; its usage has been revived in [[Cornwall]]. Historically, another Brythonic Celtic language, [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], was spoken in [[Cumbria]] in [[North West England]], but it died out in the 11th century although traces of it can still be found in the Cumbrian dialect. [[Early Modern English]] began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the [[printing press]] to London and the [[Great Vowel Shift]]. Through the worldwide influence of the [[British Empire]], English spread around the world from the 17th to mid-20th centuries. Through newspapers, books, the telegraph, the telephone, phonograph records, radio, satellite television, broadcasters (such as the [[BBC]]) and the Internet, as well as the emergence of the United States as a global superpower, Modern English has become the [[international auxiliary language|international language]] of [[business]], [[science]], [[communication]], [[sports]], [[aviation]], and [[diplomacy]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|English literature}}\n{{Section OR|date=February 2020}}{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of Geoffrey Chaucer (4671380) (cropped) 02.jpg|thumb|''Geoffrey Chaucer''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t\u0283|\u0254\u02d0|s|\u0259r}}; {{circa|1340s}} \u2013 25 October 1400) was an English poet and author.

For many years, [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]] were the preferred literary languages of England, but in the [[medieval period]] there was a flourishing of literature in [[Middle English]]; [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] is the most famous writer of this period. \n\nThe [[Elizabethan era]] is sometimes described as the golden age of English literature with writers such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[Thomas Nashe]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Sir Philip Sidney]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Ben Jonson]].\n\nOther famous English writers include [[Jane Austen]], [[Arnold Bennett]], [[Rupert Brooke]], [[Agatha Christie]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[A.

In their 2004 Annual Population Survey, the [[Office for National Statistics]] compared the ''ethnic'' identities of British people with their perceived [[national identity]]. They found that while 58% of [[white people]] in England described their nationality as \"English\", the vast majority of non-white people called themselves \"British\".<ref>\"78 per cent of [[British Bangladeshi|Bangladeshis]] said they were British, while only 5 per cent said they were English, Scottish or Welsh\", and the largest percentage of non-whites to identify as English were the people who described their ethnicity as \"[[Mixed race|Mixed]]\" (37%).[https://web.archive.org/web/20110824122026/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=459 'Identity', ''National Statistics'', 21 February 2006]</ref>\n\n===Relationship to Britishness===\nIt is unclear how many British people consider themselves English.

In his study of English identity, [[Krishan Kumar (sociologist)|Krishan Kumar]] describes a common slip of the tongue in which people say \"English, I mean British\". He notes that this slip is normally made only by the English themselves and by foreigners: \"Non-English members of the United Kingdom rarely say 'British' when they mean 'English'\". Kumar suggests that although this blurring is a sign of England's dominant position with the UK, it is also \"problematic for the English [...] when it comes to conceiving of their national identity. It tells of the difficulty that most English people have of distinguishing themselves, in a collective way, from the other inhabitants of the British Isles\".{{sfn|Kumar|2003|pp=1\u20132}}\n\nIn 1965, the historian [[A.

During this period the language and culture of most of what became England changed from [[Romano-British]] to [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]].<ref>The area of [[Lothian]] in modern Scotland was also anglicised in this period, following the conquest of the British \"kingdom\" of [[Manau Gododdin]]. It formed part of the Anglian kingdoms of [[Bernicia]] and [[Northumbria]], only becoming a part of Scotland as late as 1018, when a recent Scottish annexation was recognised by the English. See: Fry, P.S. and Mitchison, R. (1985) ''The History of Scotland'', Routledge, p. 48</ref> The Germanic speakers in Britain, themselves of diverse origins, developed a common cultural identity as [[Anglo-Saxons]] during the mid-fifth to early seventh centuries, after the [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|end of Roman power in Britain]] around the year 410. The settlement was followed by the establishment of [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon kingdoms]] in the south and east of [[Great Britain|Britain]], later followed by the rest of modern England.\n\nThe available evidence includes the scanty contemporary and near-contemporary written record, and archaeological and genetic information.{{efn| A sample of this discussion can be seen on the television series ''Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain'', particularly the discussion between Francis Pryor and Heinrich H\u00e4rke.<ref>{{Harvcolnb|Channel 4|2004}}, Episode 3 ''Britain AD: King Arthur's Britain''.</ref>}} The few literary sources tell of hostility between incomers and natives. They describe violence, destruction, massacre and the flight of the Romano-British population. Moreover, there is little clear evidence for the influence of [[British Celtic]] or [[British Latin]] on the [[Old English]] language. These factors have suggested a very large-scale invasion by various Germanic peoples. In this view, held by the majority of historians until the mid to late 20th century, much of what is now England was cleared of its prior inhabitants, and thus the genes of the later English people would have been overwhelmingly inherited from Germanic migrants.\n\n[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|The [[Incipit]] to Matthew from the [[Book of Lindisfarne]], an Insular masterpiece]]\n\nHowever, another view, probably the most widely held today, is that the migrants were fewer, possibly centred on a warrior elite \u2013 which would suggest that the incomers, having achieved a position of political and social dominance, [[acculturation|acculturated]] the natives to their language and [[material culture]], and intermarried with them to a significant degree. Archaeologists have found that settlement patterns and land use show no clear break with the Romano-British past, though there are marked changes in place names and material culture. This view predicts that the ancestry of the people of Anglo-Saxon and modern England would be largely derived from the native Romano-British. The uncertain results of genetic studies have tended to support both a predominant amount of native British Celtic ancestry, as well as a significant contribution from Anglo-Saxon migrations.\n\nEven so, if these incomers established themselves as a [[social elite]], this could have allowed them enhanced reproductive success (the so-called '[[Apartheid]] Theory').

The multi-ethnic nature of the [[Roman Empire]] meant that small numbers of other peoples may have also been present in England before the Anglo-Saxons arrived. There is archaeological evidence, for example, of an early North African presence in a Roman garrison at [[Aballava]], now [[Burgh-by-Sands]], in Cumbria: a 4th-century inscription says that the Roman military unit ''Numerus Maurorum Aurelianorum'' (\"unit of Aurelian Moors\") from Mauretania (Morocco) was stationed there.<ref>[http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/B/blackhistorymap/arch.html The archaeology of black Britain], Channel 4.

Danish invasions continued into the 11th century, and there were both English and Danish kings in the period following the unification of England (for example, [[Ethelred the Unready|\u00c6thelred II]] (978\u20131013 and 1014\u20131016) was English but [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]] (1016\u20131035) was Danish).\n\nGradually, the Danes in England came to be seen as 'English'.

After the conquest, \"English\" normally included all natives of England, whether they were of Anglo-Saxon, Scandinavian or Celtic ancestry, to distinguish them from the Norman invaders, who were regarded as \"Norman\" even if born in England, for a generation or two after the Conquest.<ref>''[[OED]]'', 2nd edition, s.v.

For example, Orderic Vitalis, a historian born in 1075 and the son of a Norman knight, said that he learned French only as a second language.

The [[Parliament of Scotland]] had previously passed its own Act of Union, so the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] was born on 1 May 1707. In 1801, another [[Act of Union 1800|Act of Union]] formed a union between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]], creating the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. In 1922, about two-thirds of the Irish population (those who lived in 26 of the 32 counties of Ireland), left the United Kingdom to form the [[Irish Free State]].

As a consequence, notions of 'Englishness' and 'Britishness' are often very similar.

The modern English language evolved from [[Middle English language|Middle English]] (the form of language in use by the English people from the 12th to the 15th century); Middle English was influenced lexically by Norman-French, Old French and Latin. In the Middle English period Latin was the language of administration and the nobility spoke Norman French. Middle English was itself derived from the [[Old English language|Old English]] of the Anglo-Saxon period; in the Northern and Eastern parts of England the language of Danish settlers had influenced the language, a fact still evident in Northern English dialects.\n\nThere were once many different dialects of modern English in England, which were recorded in projects such as the ''[[English Dialect Dictionary]]'' (late 19th century) and the [[Survey of English Dialects]] (mid 20th century), but many of these have passed out of common usage as [[Standard English]] has become more widespread through education, the media and socio-economic pressures.<ref>Wolfgang Vierick (1964), ''Der English Dialect Survey und der Linguistic Survey of Scotland - Arbeitsmethoden und bisherige Ergebnisse'', Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Mundartforschung 31, 333-335 in {{cite book |last=Shorrocks |first=Graham |year=1999 |title=A Grammar of the Dialect of the Bolton Area, Part 1 |location=Frankfurt am Main |publisher=Peter Lang |isbn=3-631-33066-9 |page=58}}</ref>\n\n[[Cornish language|Cornish]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], is one of three existing Brythonic languages; its usage has been revived in [[Cornwall]]. Historically, another Brythonic Celtic language, [[Cumbric language|Cumbric]], was spoken in [[Cumbria]] in [[North West England]], but it died out in the 11th century although traces of it can still be found in the Cumbrian dialect. [[Early Modern English]] began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the [[printing press]] to London and the [[Great Vowel Shift]]. Through the worldwide influence of the [[British Empire]], English spread around the world from the 17th to mid-20th centuries. Through newspapers, books, the telegraph, the telephone, phonograph records, radio, satellite television, broadcasters (such as the [[BBC]]) and the Internet, as well as the emergence of the United States as a global superpower, Modern English has become the [[international auxiliary language|international language]] of [[business]], [[science]], [[communication]], [[sports]], [[aviation]], and [[diplomacy]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|English literature}}\n{{Section OR|date=February 2020}}{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\n\n[[File:Portrait of Geoffrey Chaucer (4671380) (cropped) 02.jpg|thumb|''Geoffrey Chaucer''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t\u0283|\u0254\u02d0|s|\u0259r}}; {{circa|1340s}} \u2013 25 October 1400) was an English poet and author. Widely seen as the greatest English poet of the [[Middle Ages]], he is best known for ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.]]\n\nEnglish literature begins with [[Anglo-Saxon literature]], which was written in [[Old English]] and produced epic works such as [[Beowulf]] and the fragmentary [[The Battle of Maldon]], [[The Seafarer (poem)|The Seafarer]] and [[The Wanderer (Old English poem)|The Wanderer]]. For many years, [[Latin]] and [[French language|French]] were the preferred literary languages of England, but in the [[medieval period]] there was a flourishing of literature in [[Middle English]]; [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] is the most famous writer of this period. \n\nThe [[Elizabethan era]] is sometimes described as the golden age of English literature with writers such as [[William Shakespeare]], [[Thomas Nashe]], [[Edmund Spenser]], [[Sir Philip Sidney]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Ben Jonson]].\n\nOther famous English writers include [[Jane Austen]], [[Arnold Bennett]], [[Rupert Brooke]], [[Agatha Christie]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Hardy]], [[A. E. Housman]], [[George Orwell]] and the [[Lake Poets]].\n\nDue to the expansion of English into a [[world language]] during the British Empire, literature is now written in English across the world.\n\nIn 2003 the [[BBC]] carried out a UK survey entitled ''[[The Big Read]]'' in order to find the \"nation's best-loved novel\" of all time, with works by English novelists [[J.

Despite the mixed reception, it remains one of the band's highest charting singles to date. It peaked at eighty-nine on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and reached number two on the  [[Hot Rock Songs]] chart.
