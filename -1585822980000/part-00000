The [[Victory March (fight song)|Victory March]] of [[Fighting Irish|Notre Dame's Fighting Irish]], was first written and publicly performed in Holyoke in the winter of 1908 by John and Rev. Michael Shea, both alumni of the college. Michael Shea was the organist for [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in New York City at that time, and returned to Holyoke to devise the song with his brother who lived there. Shortly after completing their composition, Father Michael would run into his childhood music teacher, Professor [[William C. Hammond (organist)|William C. Hammond]] of [[Mount Holyoke College]], who was the music director of the Second Congregational Church. Upon telling Hammond about their aspiring rally song, Hammond suggested Shea perform it in on the church's organ, and in 1908 the fight song for a world renowned Catholic research university was first publicly performed at a Protestant church in Holyoke. At the conclusion of the performance, a group of the church's deacons walked in and \"were not a little shocked to see a man wearing a Roman collar energetically thumping away on the keys of their organ.

Between 1871 and 1920, 23 percent of all baseball players were Irish or Irish-American, with about 58 percent born in American towns outside the largest 14 cities of the United States. In his 2014 book ''The Irish and the Making of American Sport, 1835-1920'', historian Patrick Redmond, would describe Holyoke specifically as \"crucial to baseball's Irish history\", with 19 major league players born in the city, 10 of whom were Irish Americans from during that period.<ref name=\"redmond\">{{cite book|title=The Irish and the Making of American Sport|last=Redmond|first=Patrick R|publisher=McFarland & Company, Inc.|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|year=2014}}</ref>{{rp|57}} South Holyoke, known as Tigertown in the 1870s, was a frequent venue for baseball and earned its name from the tensions that ran between competing teams, particularly between Holyoke and Springfield, including at least one such game where a squad of police larger than both teams was required to break up a riot that had broken out between the two.<ref>{{cite news|work=Boston Sunday Globe|location=Boston|date=November 14, 1897|page=62|title=Holyoke; Mayor Smith Indorsed [sic] in the Caucuses\u2014 Old Names of Suburban Villages|quote=South Holyoke of today bears little resemblance to the 'Tigertown' of former days.

A well-known baseball man recalls the feverish excitement which was developed whenever Springfield and Holyoye [sic] met on a ball field. It was invariably a gory battle, so much so that when Springfield came up here to play the local team, a squad of police, larger than the two ball nines, was required to bring the game to a peaceful ending}}</ref>\n\nThough not on any Holyoke professional team, there would be a number of players during this era born in the city, such as [[Tommy Tucker (baseball)|Tommy Tucker]], and [[Tommy Dowd (baseball)|Tommy Dowd]].<ref name=\"redmond\"/>{{rp|57}} However more than being the hometown of such players, for a time the city hosted a number of baseball teams itself.

In this position he lobbied for a number of interests in Western Massachusetts, including for the restoration of the old [[Mount Holyoke]] Prospect Summit House at [[J. A.

Donahue's political career would end in 1971 after failing to garner the post of Democrat nominee for governor in the previous year. Choosing not to seek re-election to the senate, he would be appointed as a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts and became the first director of the Institute for Governmental Services, a publicly funded consultancy and think-tank which would later bear his name, the UMass Donahue Institute.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sen.

Perhaps most famously at the start of the 20th century, two brothers from Holyoke, the Sheas, would contribute a song which resonates in popular culture to this day. The [[Victory March (fight song)|Victory March]] of [[Fighting Irish|Notre Dame's Fighting Irish]], was first written and publicly performed in Holyoke in the winter of 1908 by John and Rev. Michael Shea, both alumni of the college. Michael Shea was the organist for [[St. Patrick's Cathedral (Manhattan)|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] in New York City at that time, and returned to Holyoke to devise the song with his brother who lived there. Shortly after completing their composition, Father Michael would run into his childhood music teacher, Professor [[William C. Hammond (organist)|William C. Hammond]] of [[Mount Holyoke College]], who was the music director of the Second Congregational Church. Upon telling Hammond about their aspiring rally song, Hammond suggested Shea perform it in on the church's organ, and in 1908 the fight song for a world renowned Catholic research university was first publicly performed at a Protestant church in Holyoke. At the conclusion of the performance, a group of the church's deacons walked in and \"were not a little shocked to see a man wearing a Roman collar energetically thumping away on the keys of their organ. One deacon had a remark to make when the recital was finished.
