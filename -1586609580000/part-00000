He was born in [[Lefkimmi]] in the island of [[Corfu]], [[Greece]] in 1774, and died in 1842. He had been also granted [[French people|French]] nationality.\n\n== Life ==\n\n=== Youth ===\nStamatis Voulgaris was born in [[Lefkimmi]], on the island of [[Corfu]] in the [[Ionian Islands]], in 1774. His parents were Al\u00e9xandros Vo\u00falgaris of Aloys\u00edus and Louk\u00eda Pand\u00eds. From the age of seven, he attended school at St. Justine's monastery in Garitsa, where he learned his first letters. There, he was a classmate of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], the future governor of Greece. An interesting incident led him to his decision to become an urban planner. During the brief Russian-Turkish siege (1799), while in the vicinity of the San Giacomo theater in Corfu, a [[cannon]] ball fired from a Russian vessel fell beside young Voulgaris without immediately exploding. He immediately grabbed the fuse and then neutralized it, thus saving the theater and a whole French military detachment which passed nearby with heavy weapons and ammunition. French General [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Jean Chabot]], a friend of [[Napoleon]], in order to honor his bravery, enlisted him in the French army.<ref name=\":0\">Pavlos Kyriazis, \"''Stamatis Voulgaris.

At the same time, he studied at the [[Coll\u00e8ge des Quatre-Nations]] (which now houses the headquarters of the [[Institut de France]]). He became an engineer geographer and an extraordinary designer in the service of the ministry's [[D\u00e9p\u00f4t de la Guerre]] (a depository of maps and archives). He participated in several military missions, notably between 1810 and 1814, as an employee at the General Staff of the governor of the [[Ionian Islands]], General [[Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Donzelot]]. He was arrested by the English and imprisoned in [[Malta]] in 1814. When he was released, he undertook a new special mission in [[Epirus]] and [[Albania]], then was recalled to France to fight at the [[battle of Waterloo]] on 18 June 1815.

His parents were Al\u00e9xandros Vo\u00falgaris of Aloys\u00edus and Louk\u00eda Pand\u00eds. From the age of seven, he attended school at St. Justine's monastery in Garitsa, where he learned his first letters. There, he was a classmate of [[Ioannis Kapodistrias]], the future governor of Greece. An interesting incident led him to his decision to become an urban planner. During the brief Russian-Turkish siege (1799), while in the vicinity of the San Giacomo theater in Corfu, a [[cannon]] ball fired from a Russian vessel fell beside young Voulgaris without immediately exploding. He immediately grabbed the fuse and then neutralized it, thus saving the theater and a whole French military detachment which passed nearby with heavy weapons and ammunition. French General [[Louis Fran\u00e7ois Jean Chabot]], a friend of [[Napoleon]], in order to honor his bravery, enlisted him in the French army.<ref name=\":0\">Pavlos Kyriazis, \"''Stamatis Voulgaris.
