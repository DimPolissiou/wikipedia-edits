It was organized in 1729 as the parish of \"Summersworth\", meaning \"summer town\", because during that season the ministers would preach here. It was set off and incorporated in 1754 by colonial governor [[Benning Wentworth]], and until 1849 included [[Rollinsford, New Hampshire|Rollinsford]]. A clerical error at incorporation contracted the name to \"Somersworth\". It would be incorporated as a city in 1893, before which it was also known as \"Great Falls\".\n[[File:Small girls working in Great Falls Mfg. Co. Many others there. Somersworth, N.H. - NARA - 523193.jpg|thumb|left|Child laborers at Great Falls Manufacturing, 1909.  Photo by [[Lewis Hine]].]]\n[[Image:High Street, Somersworth, NH.jpg|thumb|left|High Street, c. 1910]]\n\nSituated where the [[Salmon Falls River]] drops {{convert|100|ft|m}} over a mile, Somersworth early became a [[mill town]], beginning with [[gristmill]]s and [[sawmill]]s. In 1822, the brothers Isaac and Jacob Wendell of [[Boston]] purchased for $5,000 a gristmill with its water rights at the Great Falls. They established the Great Falls Manufacturing Company, a [[textile]] business that expanded to include three mills for [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] thread and [[weaving]] cotton and woolen fabrics, specializing in \"drillings, shirtings and sheetings.\" Throughout the 19th century, other expansive brick mill buildings, including a [[bleach]]ery and [[dyeing|dye works]], were erected beside the river. The bleachery became the longest running textile operation in Somersworth. The building housed the operations that took the buff-colored fabric produced in the seven mills and transformed it into a sparkling white material that could be dyed or printed according to the buyer's wishes.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.somersworth.com/departments-services/library/brief-history-of-somersworth/| title=Brief History of Somersworth| website=www.somersworth.com| access-date=2016-06-03}}</ref> The gate house at the dam directed water as needed, regulating the flow either into the river or a company canal, which itself had gates sending it under the mill. [[Water power]] turned the wheels and belts that operated mill machinery. The railroad arrived in the early 1840s, before which goods were carted to Dover.\n\nAt first millworkers came from surrounding farms, including those in [[Berwick, Maine]], directly across the bridge. Many were women.  But as the need for labor grew, immigrants arrived from [[Ireland]], and later [[Quebec]]. Brick [[tenement]] [[row house]]s were rented by the company to employee families, many of whose members worked in the mills beside their parents before passage of [[child labor]] laws. For relaxation, workers found entertainment at the Opera House or at Central Park, an [[amusement park]] beside Willand Pond. In the early 1870s, the [[Portsmouth, Great Falls & Conway Railroad]] began excursions to the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]]. The Electric Street Railway came in 1890, allowing [[tram|trolley]] rides to [[York, Maine|York Beach, Maine]].\n\nBut the [[New England]] textile industry went into decline in the 20th century. Water power was replaced with newer forms of energy, and cotton could be manufactured where it grew, saving transportation costs. Labor was also cheaper in the [[Southern United States|South]], which did not have New Hampshire's inventory tax that levied commodities like coal and cotton at the plants. The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] sent many regional textile firms into [[bankruptcy]], when some local facilities were adapted for [[shoemaking]]. The Great Falls Manufacturing Company's big mill was renovated for other uses in the 1980s, although the bleachery suffered a devastating fire in November 2003, which required assistance from 23 fire departments from New Hampshire and [[Maine]]. The [[General Electric Company]] operates a factory that manufactures state of the art electric meters for the energy business.\n\nSomersworth's heyday was during the mill era. Although frequently overshadowed by the larger neighboring cities of Dover and [[Rochester, New Hampshire|Rochester]], Somersworth retains a quantity of [[Victorian architecture]] from its prosperous age. Some antique residences, most notably within the historic district known as \"The Hill\", have been restored. The municipality is today largely a [[bedroom community]] for other cities and the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]]. The upper end of High Street, however, continues to develop as a retail center, with several [[big-box]] [[chain store]]s.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Opera House, Somersworth, NH.jpg|Opera House c. 1908\nFile:R.

[[Old Somersworth High School|Hilltop School]], built at the same location in 1927, replaced the original high school. Later it would be converted to an elementary school.\n\nIn 1999, after numerous fire code violations were identified with the Hilltop School by the New Hampshire State Fire Marshal, the City of Somersworth was granted waivers for a period of three years to address the state's concerns. Despite the failure of the school district to address the numerous code violations during the probation period, the waivers continued to be extended past their originally intended three-year period. In August 2007, the upper floors of the school were closed by the New Hampshire State Fire Marshall after the city neglected to fix code violations they were warned about in November 2006.\n\nThe closure of the upper floors came just weeks before neighborhood students were scheduled to return from summer vacation. This resulted in the start of school being delayed by over two weeks for Hilltop students. Three portable classrooms were brought in for \"2 years\" in 2007. Students were still occupying the three portable classrooms surpassing the time allotted as of August 18, 2010.\n\nIn the spring of 2007, the Somersworth School Board voted to build a new school to replace Hilltop. On February 17, 2009, the Somersworth City Council voted to approve bonding in the amount of $19.9 million for the construction of a new elementary school. The new school has been named Idlehurst, and has been functioning in the SAU 56 school system as of the start of the 2011-2012 school year.\n\nIn May of 2019, Somersworth Middle School was awarded 2019 Middle School of the Year by the New Hampshire Department of Education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fosters.com/news/20190513/somersworth-middle-school-named-nhs-best|title=Somersworth Middle School named NH's best|last=Stucker|first=Kyle|website=fosters.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> The middle school, led by Principal Dana Hilliard, was awarded this award for excellence in education for its ability to engage students and support their social and emotional growth. \n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- Note:\n\u00b7 Only people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here.

It was organized in 1729 as the parish of \"Summersworth\", meaning \"summer town\", because during that season the ministers would preach here. It was set off and incorporated in 1754 by colonial governor [[Benning Wentworth]], and until 1849 included [[Rollinsford, New Hampshire|Rollinsford]]. A clerical error at incorporation contracted the name to \"Somersworth\". It would be incorporated as a city in 1893, before which it was also known as \"Great Falls\".\n[[File:Small girls working in Great Falls Mfg. Co. Many others there. Somersworth, N.H. - NARA - 523193.jpg|thumb|left|Child laborers at Great Falls Manufacturing, 1909.  Photo by [[Lewis Hine]].]]\n[[Image:High Street, Somersworth, NH.jpg|thumb|left|High Street, c. 1910]]\n\nSituated where the [[Salmon Falls River]] drops {{convert|100|ft|m}} over a mile, Somersworth early became a [[mill town]], beginning with [[gristmill]]s and [[sawmill]]s. In 1822, the brothers Isaac and Jacob Wendell of [[Boston]] purchased for $5,000 a gristmill with its water rights at the Great Falls. They established the Great Falls Manufacturing Company, a [[textile]] business that expanded to include three mills for [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] thread and [[weaving]] cotton and woolen fabrics, specializing in \"drillings, shirtings and sheetings.\" Throughout the 19th century, other expansive brick mill buildings, including a [[bleach]]ery and [[dyeing|dye works]], were erected beside the river. The bleachery became the longest running textile operation in Somersworth. The building housed the operations that took the buff-colored fabric produced in the seven mills and transformed it into a sparkling white material that could be dyed or printed according to the buyer's wishes.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.somersworth.com/departments-services/library/brief-history-of-somersworth/| title=Brief History of Somersworth| website=www.somersworth.com| access-date=2016-06-03}}</ref> The gate house at the dam directed water as needed, regulating the flow either into the river or a company canal, which itself had gates sending it under the mill. [[Water power]] turned the wheels and belts that operated mill machinery. The railroad arrived in the early 1840s, before which goods were carted to Dover.\n\nAt first millworkers came from surrounding farms, including those in [[Berwick, Maine]], directly across the bridge. Many were women.  But as the need for labor grew, immigrants arrived from [[Ireland]], and later [[Quebec]]. Brick [[tenement]] [[row house]]s were rented by the company to employee families, many of whose members worked in the mills beside their parents before passage of [[child labor]] laws. For relaxation, workers found entertainment at the Opera House or at Central Park, an [[amusement park]] beside Willand Pond. In the early 1870s, the [[Portsmouth, Great Falls & Conway Railroad]] began excursions to the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]]. The Electric Street Railway came in 1890, allowing [[tram|trolley]] rides to [[York, Maine|York Beach, Maine]].\n\nBut the [[New England]] textile industry went into decline in the 20th century. Water power was replaced with newer forms of energy, and cotton could be manufactured where it grew, saving transportation costs. Labor was also cheaper in the [[Southern United States|South]], which did not have New Hampshire's inventory tax that levied commodities like coal and cotton at the plants. The [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] sent many regional textile firms into [[bankruptcy]], when some local facilities were adapted for [[shoemaking]]. The Great Falls Manufacturing Company's big mill was renovated for other uses in the 1980s, although the bleachery suffered a devastating fire in November 2003, which required assistance from 23 fire departments from New Hampshire and [[Maine]]. The [[General Electric Company]] operates a factory that manufactures state of the art electric meters for the energy business.\n\nSomersworth's heyday was during the mill era. Although frequently overshadowed by the larger neighboring cities of Dover and [[Rochester, New Hampshire|Rochester]], Somersworth retains a quantity of [[Victorian architecture]] from its prosperous age. Some antique residences, most notably within the historic district known as \"The Hill\", have been restored. The municipality is today largely a [[bedroom community]] for other cities and the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]]. The upper end of High Street, however, continues to develop as a retail center, with several [[big-box]] [[chain store]]s.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:The Opera House, Somersworth, NH.jpg|Opera House c. 1908\nFile:R.

[[Old Somersworth High School|Hilltop School]], built at the same location in 1927, replaced the original high school. Later it would be converted to an elementary school.\n\nIn 1999, after numerous fire code violations were identified with the Hilltop School by the New Hampshire State Fire Marshal, the City of Somersworth was granted waivers for a period of three years to address the state's concerns. Despite the failure of the school district to address the numerous code violations during the probation period, the waivers continued to be extended past their originally intended three-year period. In August 2007, the upper floors of the school were closed by the New Hampshire State Fire Marshall after the city neglected to fix code violations they were warned about in November 2006.\n\nThe closure of the upper floors came just weeks before neighborhood students were scheduled to return from summer vacation. This resulted in the start of school being delayed by over two weeks for Hilltop students. Three portable classrooms were brought in for \"2 years\" in 2007. Students were still occupying the three portable classrooms surpassing the time allotted as of August 18, 2010.\n\nIn the spring of 2007, the Somersworth School Board voted to build a new school to replace Hilltop. On February 17, 2009, the Somersworth City Council voted to approve bonding in the amount of $19.9 million for the construction of a new elementary school. The new school has been named Idlehurst, and has been functioning in the SAU 56 school system as of the start of the 2011-2012 school year.\n\nIn May of 2019, Somersworth Middle School was awarded 2019 Middle School of the Year by the New Hampshire Department of Education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fosters.com/news/20190513/somersworth-middle-school-named-nhs-best|title=Somersworth Middle School named NH's best|last=Stucker|first=Kyle|website=fosters.com|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> The middle school, led by Principal Dana Hilliard, was awarded this award for excellence in education for its ability to engage students and support their social and emotional growth. \n\n==Notable people==\n<!-- Note:\n\u00b7 Only people who already have a Wikipedia article may appear here.

The canopy level is the third level of the temperate rainforest. The trees forming the canopy, [[conifers]], can stand as tall as 100 meters or more. A variety of species survive in the canopy. The tops of these trees collect most of the rain, moisture, and photosynthesis that the [[rainforest]] takes in. They form a canopy over the forest, covering about 95% of the floor during the summer.\n\nThe canopy\u2019s coverage affects the [[shade tolerance]] levels of forest floor plants. When the canopy is in full bloom, covering about 95% of the floor, plant survival decreases. Some plant species have become shade tolerant in order to survive. \nThe treetops take in the heavy amount of rain and keep the lower levels of the forest damp.\n\nThe canopy survives through [[photosynthesis]]. The leaves provide energy and nutrients for the trees, which provide homes and food for the forest. Through satellite data, the radiation use efficiency (RUE) calculates the annual amount of photosynthesis that occurs in temperate rainforests. A diverse amount of photosynthesis occurs based on the location and [[microclimate]]s of the forest.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Global distribution==\n[[File:Temperate rainforest map.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Map showing the areas of temperate rain forest]]\nTemperate forests cover a large part of the Earth, but temperate rainforests only occur in a few regions around the world. Most of these occur in oceanic moist climates: the [[Pacific temperate rain forest (WWF ecoregion)|Pacific temperate rain forests]] in Western [[North America]] (Southeastern [[Alaska]] to Central [[California]]), the [[Valdivian temperate rainforests|Valdivian]] and [[Magellanic subpolar forests|Magellanic]] temperate rainforests of southwestern [[South America]] (Southern [[Chile]] and adjacent [[Argentina]]), pockets of rain forest in [[Northwestern Europe]] (southern [[Norway]] to northern [[Iberia]]), temperate rainforests of southeastern [[Australia]] ([[Tasmania]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]) and the [[New Zealand]] temperate rainforests ([[South Island]]'s west coast).\n\nOthers occur in subtropical moist climates; [[South Africa]]'s [[Knysna-Amatole coastal forests]], the [[Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests|Colchan rainforests]] of the [[Black Sea]] region (southeast corner of [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), the Caspian temperate rainforests of [[Iran]] and [[Azerbaijan]], the mountain temperate rainforests along eastern [[Taiwan]]'s Pacific coast, the eastern coast of the [[Korean Peninsula]] along the length of the [[Baekdudaegan|Baekdu Mountain Range]] and in the area surrounding [[Jirisan|Mt. Jiri]] and across the peninsula's southern coastline, southwest [[Japan]]'s Taiheiyo forests, coastal [[New South Wales]] and New Zealand's [[North Island]].\n\nAdditionally pockets of temperate rainforest occur in dreary climates that are not categorized by just annual precipitation but also number of cloudy days as well as number of days of measurable precipitation in the form of rain or snow.  In Western North America outside the [[Pacific Northwest]], the [[Columbia Mountains]] of [[British Columbia]] (BC), northern [[Idaho]] and northwestern [[Montana]], have more of a continental climate and have pockets of temperate coniferous rainforest.\n\nIn Eastern North America, there are scattered pockets of temperate rainforest along the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and adjacent parts of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] from [[West Virginia]] to [[New England]]. These areas include sections of West Virginia, Western Pennsylvania, as well as [[Western New York]] and the [[Adirondack Mountains]].  A good example of these forests are found in [[Zoar Valley]] in [[Western New York]] (nearest major city is [[Buffalo, New York]]), [[Cook Forest State Park]] within the [[Allegheny National Forest]] (nearest major city is [[Pittsburgh]]), and [[Cathedral State Park]] in West Virginia. \n\nIn Eastern Asia, there are scattered pockets of temperate rainforest in what is known as the [[Russian Far East]] ([[Ussuri]], [[Outer Manchuria]], [[Sakhalin]]) in [[Asia]] where the climate is also continental in nature, but get enough precipitation and cloud cover to harbor significant pockets of temperate rainforest.  Like Eastern North America, much precipitation is in the form of rain and snow. The mountainous coniferous forests of the [[Changbai Mountains]] bordering [[China]] and [[North Korea]] are also a good example, containing some of the richest high-elevation coniferous evergreen forests in [[East Asia]].\n\n==Temperate rain forest regions by continent==\n\n===North America===\n\n====Pacific temperate rain forests====\n{{Main|Pacific temperate rain forests (WWF ecoregion)}}\n[[File:Mt Hood Wilderness near Ramona Falls.jpg|thumb|Temperate rain forest in the [[Mount Hood Wilderness]], Oregon, USA.

They vary in their species composition, but are all predominantly [[coniferous]], sometimes with an [[understory]] of [[broadleaved]] [[tree]]s and [[shrub]]s. Most of the precipitation occurs in winter, similar to [[Mediterranean climate]]s, but in summer, [[fog]] moisture is extracted by the trees and produces a [[fog drip]] keeping the forest moist.<ref name=Franklin>Franklin, J.F. & Dyrness C.T.

In higher elevation (over 1,980 metres (6,500&nbsp;ft)), Fraser fir is dominant, in middle elevation (1,675 to 1,890 metres (5,495 to 6,201&nbsp;ft)) red spruce and Fraser fir grow together, and in lower elevation (1,370 to 1,650 metres (4,490 to 5,410&nbsp;ft)) red spruce is dominant. Yellow birch, mountain ash, and mountain maple grow in the understory. Younger spruce and fir and shrubs like raspberry, blackberry, hobblebush, southern mountain cranberries, red elderberry, minniebush, southern bush honeysuckle are understory vegetation. Below the spruce-fir forest, at around 1,200 metres (3,900&nbsp;ft), are forests of American beech, yellow birch, maple birch, and oak.[9] Skunk cabbage and ground juniper are northern species that were pushed into the areas from the north.\n\nThe mild and wet environment supports the high diversity of fungi.

Temperate rain forests occur in the [[Valdivian temperate rain forests]] and [[Magellanic subpolar forests]] ecoregions. The Valdivian rainforests are home to a variety of broadleaf evergreen trees, like ''[[Aextoxicon punctatum]]'', ''[[Eucryphia cordifolia]]'', and [[southern beech]] (''Nothofagus''), but include many [[conifers]] as well, notably [[Fitzroya|Alerce]] (''Fitzroya cupressoides''), one of the largest tree species of the world.\n\nThe Valdivian and Magellanic temperate rainforests are the only temperate rain forests in [[South America]]. Together they are the second largest in the world, after the [[Pacific temperate rain forests]] of [[North America]]. The Valdivian forests are a refuge for the [[Antarctic flora]], and share many plant [[Family (biology)|families]] and [[genera]] with the temperate rainforests of [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Australia]]. Fully half the species of woody plants are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to this ecoregion.\n\nIn the Valdivian region the Andean Cordillera intercepts moist westerly winds along the Pacific coast during winter and summer months; these winds cool as they ascend the mountains, creating heavy rainfall on the mountains' west-facing slopes. The northward-flowing oceanic Humboldt Current creates humid and foggy conditions near the coast. The tree line is at about 2,400&nbsp;m in the northern part of the ecoregion (35\u00b0S), and descends to 1,000&nbsp;m in the south of the [[Los R\u00edos Region|Valdivian region]].

There are several coniferous [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]] that grow here. This forest receives a lot of moisture as fog from the Indian Ocean, and resembles not only other temperate rain forests worldwide, but also the montane evergreen [[Afromontane]] forests that occur at higher elevations in southern and eastern Africa. A fine example of this forest is in South Africa's [[Tsitsikamma National Park]].\n\n===Europe===\nTemperate rainforest occurs in fragments across the north and west of Europe in countries such as southern [[Norway]] (see [[Scandinavian coastal conifer forests]]) and northern [[Spain]]. Other temperate rainforest regions include areas of south eastern Europe such as mountains on the east coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]], surrounding North Western [[Bulgaria]] along with the [[Black Sea]].\n\n====Atlantic Oakwood forest (United Kingdom and Ireland)====\nThe woodlands are variously referred to in Britain as Upland Oakwoods, Atlantic Oakwoods, Western Oakwoods or Temperate Rainforest, [[Caledonian forest]], and colloquially as 'Celtic Rainforests'. They are also listed in the [[British National Vegetation Classification]] as [[British NVC community W11]] and [[British NVC community W17]] depending on the ground flora. The majority of surviving fragments of Atlantic Oakwoods in Britain occur on steep-sided slopes above rivers and lakes which have avoided clearance and intensive grazing pressure. There are notable examples on the islands and shores of [[Loch Maree]], [[Loch Sunart]], [[Loch Lomond]] and one of the best preserved sites on the remote [[Taynish National Nature Reserve|Taynish Peninsula]] in Argyll. There are also small areas on steep-sided riverine gorges in [[Snowdonia]] and Mid Wales. In England, they occur in the [[Lake District]] ([[Borrowdale]] Woods) and steep-sided riverine and estuarine valleys in Devon and Cornwall including the [[Fowey]] valley in Cornwall and the valley of the [[river Dart]] which flows off [[Dartmoor]] and has rainfall in excess of 2&nbsp;metres per year.<ref name=\"UK Government Met Office\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070109134904/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/location/southwestengland/rainfall.html UK Government Met Office].

''Fraga'' is a [[Galician language|Galician]] word for \"natural woodland\", (old-growth forest) and the park is an example of a temperate rainforest in which oak ([[Quercus robur]] and [[Quercus pyrenaica]]) is the [[climax vegetation]]. The protected area extends along the valley of the river Eume within the [[Ferrolterra]] municipalities of [[Pontedeume]], [[Cabanas, Galicia|Cabanas]], [[A Capela, Galicia|A Capela]], [[Monfero]] and [[As Pontes de Garc\u00eda Rodr\u00edguez]]. Some 500 people reside within the park. The monastery of [[Saint John of Caaveiro]] also lies within the park.\n\nThe area was declared a [[Natural park (Spain)|natural park]] (a level of protection lower than [[national park]]) in 1997. It is one of six natural parks in Galicia. The European Union has recognised the park as a [[Site of Community Importance]]. There are a number of species of ferns.

The canopy level is the third level of the temperate rainforest. The trees forming the canopy, [[conifers]], can stand as tall as 100 meters or more. A variety of species survive in the canopy. The tops of these trees collect most of the rain, moisture, and photosynthesis that the [[rainforest]] takes in. They form a canopy over the forest, covering about 95% of the floor during the summer.\n\nThe canopy\u2019s coverage affects the [[shade tolerance]] levels of forest floor plants. When the canopy is in full bloom, covering about 95% of the floor, plant survival decreases. Some plant species have become shade tolerant in order to survive. \nThe treetops take in the heavy amount of rain and keep the lower levels of the forest damp.\n\nThe canopy survives through [[photosynthesis]]. The leaves provide energy and nutrients for the trees, which provide homes and food for the forest. Through satellite data, the radiation use efficiency (RUE) calculates the annual amount of photosynthesis that occurs in temperate rainforests. A diverse amount of photosynthesis occurs based on the location and [[microclimate]]s of the forest.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Global distribution==\n[[File:Temperate rainforest map.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Map showing the areas of temperate rain forest]]\nTemperate forests cover a large part of the Earth, but temperate rainforests only occur in a few regions around the world. Most of these occur in oceanic moist climates: the [[Pacific temperate rain forest (WWF ecoregion)|Pacific temperate rain forests]] in Western [[North America]] (Southeastern [[Alaska]] to Central [[California]]), the [[Valdivian temperate rainforests|Valdivian]] and [[Magellanic subpolar forests|Magellanic]] temperate rainforests of southwestern [[South America]] (Southern [[Chile]] and adjacent [[Argentina]]), pockets of rain forest in [[Northwestern Europe]] (southern [[Norway]] to northern [[Iberia]]), temperate rainforests of southeastern [[Australia]] ([[Tasmania]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]) and the [[New Zealand]] temperate rainforests ([[South Island]]'s west coast).\n\nOthers occur in subtropical moist climates; [[South Africa]]'s [[Knysna-Amatole coastal forests]], the [[Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests|Colchan rainforests]] of the [[Black Sea]] region (southeast corner of [[Bulgaria]], [[Turkey]] and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]), the Caspian temperate rainforests of [[Iran]] and [[Azerbaijan]], the mountain temperate rainforests along eastern [[Taiwan]]'s Pacific coast, the eastern coast of the [[Korean Peninsula]] along the length of the [[Baekdudaegan|Baekdu Mountain Range]] and in the area surrounding [[Jirisan|Mt. Jiri]] and across the peninsula's southern coastline, southwest [[Japan]]'s Taiheiyo forests, coastal [[New South Wales]] and New Zealand's [[North Island]].\n\nAdditionally pockets of temperate rainforest occur in dreary climates that are not categorized by just annual precipitation but also number of cloudy days as well as number of days of measurable precipitation in the form of rain or snow.  In Western North America outside the [[Pacific Northwest]], the [[Columbia Mountains]] of [[British Columbia]] (BC), northern [[Idaho]] and northwestern [[Montana]], have more of a continental climate and have pockets of temperate coniferous rainforest.\n\nIn Eastern North America, there are scattered pockets of temperate rainforest along the [[Allegheny Plateau]] and adjacent parts of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] from [[West Virginia]] to [[New England]]. These areas include sections of West Virginia, Western Pennsylvania, as well as [[Western New York]] and the [[Adirondack Mountains]].  A good example of these forests are found in [[Zoar Valley]] in [[Western New York]] (nearest major city is [[Buffalo, New York]]), [[Cook Forest State Park]] within the [[Allegheny National Forest]] (nearest major city is [[Pittsburgh]]), and [[Cathedral State Park]] in West Virginia. \n\nIn Eastern Asia, there are scattered pockets of temperate rainforest in what is known as the [[Russian Far East]] ([[Ussuri]], [[Outer Manchuria]], [[Sakhalin]]) in [[Asia]] where the climate is also continental in nature, but get enough precipitation and cloud cover to harbor significant pockets of temperate rainforest.  Like Eastern North America, much precipitation is in the form of rain and snow.

Temperate rain forests occur in the [[Valdivian temperate rain forests]] and [[Magellanic subpolar forests]] ecoregions. The Valdivian rainforests are home to a variety of broadleaf evergreen trees, like ''[[Aextoxicon punctatum]]'', ''[[Eucryphia cordifolia]]'', and [[southern beech]] (''Nothofagus''), but include many [[conifers]] as well, notably [[Fitzroya|Alerce]] (''Fitzroya cupressoides''), one of the largest tree species of the world.\n\nThe Valdivian and Magellanic temperate rainforests are the only temperate rain forests in [[South America]]. Together they are the second largest in the world, after the [[Pacific temperate rain forests]] of [[North America]]. The Valdivian forests are a refuge for the [[Antarctic flora]], and share many plant [[Family (biology)|families]] and [[genera]] with the temperate rainforests of [[New Zealand]], [[Tasmania]], and [[Australia]]. Fully half the species of woody plants are [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to this ecoregion.\n\nIn the Valdivian region the Andean Cordillera intercepts moist westerly winds along the Pacific coast during winter and summer months; these winds cool as they ascend the mountains, creating heavy rainfall on the mountains' west-facing slopes. The northward-flowing oceanic Humboldt Current creates humid and foggy conditions near the coast. The tree line is at about 2,400&nbsp;m in the northern part of the ecoregion (35\u00b0S), and descends to 1,000&nbsp;m in the south of the [[Los R\u00edos Region|Valdivian region]].

There are several coniferous [[Podocarpaceae|podocarps]] that grow here. This forest receives a lot of moisture as fog from the Indian Ocean, and resembles not only other temperate rain forests worldwide, but also the montane evergreen [[Afromontane]] forests that occur at higher elevations in southern and eastern Africa. A fine example of this forest is in South Africa's [[Tsitsikamma National Park]].\n\n===Europe===\nTemperate rainforest occurs in fragments across the north and west of Europe in countries such as southern [[Norway]] (see [[Scandinavian coastal conifer forests]]) and northern [[Spain]]. Other temperate rainforest regions include areas of south eastern Europe such as mountains on the east coast of the [[Adriatic Sea]], surrounding North Western [[Bulgaria]] along with the [[Black Sea]].\n\n====Atlantic Oakwood forest (United Kingdom and Ireland)====\nThe woodlands are variously referred to in Britain as Upland Oakwoods, Atlantic Oakwoods, Western Oakwoods or Temperate Rainforest, [[Caledonian forest]], and colloquially as 'Celtic Rainforests'. They are also listed in the [[British National Vegetation Classification]] as [[British NVC community W11]] and [[British NVC community W17]] depending on the ground flora. The majority of surviving fragments of Atlantic Oakwoods in Britain occur on steep-sided slopes above rivers and lakes which have avoided clearance and intensive grazing pressure. There are notable examples on the islands and shores of [[Loch Maree]], [[Loch Sunart]], [[Loch Lomond]] and one of the best preserved sites on the remote [[Taynish National Nature Reserve|Taynish Peninsula]] in Argyll. There are also small areas on steep-sided riverine gorges in [[Snowdonia]] and Mid Wales. In England, they occur in the [[Lake District]] ([[Borrowdale]] Woods) and steep-sided riverine and estuarine valleys in Devon and Cornwall including the [[Fowey]] valley in Cornwall and the valley of the [[river Dart]] which flows off [[Dartmoor]] and has rainfall in excess of 2&nbsp;metres per year.<ref name=\"UK Government Met Office\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20070109134904/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/location/southwestengland/rainfall.html UK Government Met Office].

Reports from the colonial British Indian and [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] stated that he was a stranger in Afghanistan, and spoke the Dari language with an Iranian accent and followed European lifestyle more than that of Muslims, not observing [[Ramadan]] or other Muslim rites.<ref name=\"Astane\" /> In 1868, the throne of Kabul was occupied by [[Sher Ali Khan]], and Al-Afghani was forced to leave the country.<ref name=\"Iranica\" />\n\nHe travelled to Constantinople, passing through [[Cairo]] on his way there.

In the late 1860s he was in Afghanistan until he was expelled and returned to India. He went to Istanbul and was again expelled in 1871, when he proceeded to Cairo, where his circle of disciples was similar to Blavatsky's Brotherhood of Luxor. Afghani was forced to leave Egypt and settled in Hyderabad, India, in 1879, the year the Theosophical Society's founders arrived in Bombay. He then left India and spent a short time in Egypt before arriving in Paris in 1884. The following year he proceeded to London, and then on to Russia where he collaborated with Blavatsky's publisher, [[Mikhail Katkov]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=U1FTZKQ5wTsC&printsec=frontcover&pg=GBS.PA50|title=Initiates of Theosophical Masters|last=Johnson|first=K.

His ideas were considered radical, and he was exiled in 1879. He then travelled to Constantinople, London, Paris, Moscow, St. Petersburg and Munich.\n\nIn 1884, he began publishing an Arabic newspaper in Paris entitled ''[[al-Urwah al-Wuthqa]]'' (\"The Indissoluble Link\"<ref name=\"Britannica\" />) with [[Muhammad Abduh]]; the title ([[Arabic]]: '''\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0648\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u062b\u0642\u0649'''), sometimes translated as \"The Strongest Bond\", is taken from the [[Quran]] \u2013 chapter 2, verse 256.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=2&verse=256|title=The Quranic Arabic Corpus \u2013 Translation|website=corpus.quran.com|access-date=2016-03-10}}</ref> The newspaper called for a return to the original principles and ideals of Islam, and for greater unity among Islamic peoples.

After seven months of preaching to admirers from the shrine, he was arrested in 1891, transported to the border with [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Mesopotamia]], and evicted from Iran. Although Al-Afghani quarrelled with most of his patrons, it is said he \"reserved his strongest hatred for the Shah,\" whom he accused of weakening Islam by granting [[Concession (contract)|concessions]] to Europeans and squandering the money earned thereby. His agitation against the Shah is thought to have been one of the \"fountain-heads\" of the successful 1891 [[Tobacco Protest|protest against]] the granting a tobacco monopoly to a British company, and the later 1905 [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutional Revolution]].<ref>Roy Mottahedeh, ''The Mantle of the Prophet: Religion and Politics in Iran'' (Oxford: One World, 2000), pp. 183\u2013184</ref>\n\nHe was invited by [[Abdulhamid II]] in 1892 to Istanbul. He traveled there with diplomatic immunity from the British Embassy, which raised many eyebrows, but nevertheless was granted a house and salary by the Sultan. Abdulhamid II's aim was to use Al-Afghani for Pan Islamism propagation.\n\nWhile in Istanbul in 1895, Al-Afghani was visited by a Persian ex-prisoner, [[Mirza Reza Kermani]], and together they planned the assassination of the Shah, [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Naser-al-Din]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book |title=A history of Iran: Empire of the Mind |last=Axworthy |first=Michael |isbn=0-465-09876-2 |page=198 |oclc=914195458}}</ref> Kermani later returned to Iran, and assassinated [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar|Naser-al-Din]] at gunpoint on May 1, 1896, while the Shah was visiting a shrine.
