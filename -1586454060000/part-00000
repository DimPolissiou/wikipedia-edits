{"title_page": "Credit score", "text_new": "{{About|an individual's credit score|organization's credit rating|credit rating}}\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2011}}\nA '''credit score''' is a numerical expression based on a level analysis of a person's credit files, to represent the [[creditworthiness]] of an individual. A credit score is primarily based on a [[credit report]], information typically sourced from [[credit bureau]]s.\n\nLenders, such as [[bank]]s and credit card companies, use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to [[bad debt]].  Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what [[interest rate]], and what credit limits.  Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue. The use of credit or [[identity scoring]] prior to authorizing access or granting credit is an implementation of a [[trusted system]].\n\nCredit scoring is not limited to banks. Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, insurance companies, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques. Digital finance companies such as online lenders also use alternative data sources to calculate the creditworthiness of borrowers.\n\n==By country==\n\n===Australia===\n\nIn Australia, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.\n\nAlthough [[logistic function|logistic]] (or [[non-linear]]) probability modelling is still the most popular means by which to develop scorecards, various other methods offer powerful alternatives, including [[Multivariate adaptive regression splines|MARS]], [[Predictive analytics#Classification and regression trees|CART]], [[CHAID]], and [[random forest]]s.\n\nPrior to 12 March 2014 [[Veda Advantage]], the main provider of credit file data, provided only a negative credit reporting system containing information on applications for credit and adverse listings indicating a default under a credit contract. Veda was acquired by Equifax in Feb 2016,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.equifax.com.au/news-media/equifax-completes-acquisition-australias-leading-credit-information-company-veda-group|title=Equifax Completes Acquisition of Australia\u2019s Leading Credit Information Company, Veda Group Limited, for Total Consideration of USD$1.9 Billion|date=25 February 2016|work=Equifax Australia|access-date=6 March 2018|language=en}}</ref> making Equifax the largest credit agency in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/52.%20Overview%3A%20Credit%20Reporting/credit-reporting-agencies|title=Credit reporting agencies|last=Anonymous|date=17 August 2010|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the subsequent introduction of positive reporting, lending companies have begun an uptake of its usage with some implementing [[Risk-based pricing|risk based pricing]] to set lending rates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McGeorge|first1=Noah|title=fico ratings|url=https://aaacreditguide.com/fico-credit-score-range/|accessdate=28 February 2013|agency=Barff|issue=Atlanta|publisher=Marcus Arnold}}</ref>\n\n===Austria===\nIn [[Austria]], credit scoring is done as a blacklist. Consumers who did not pay bills end up on the blacklists that are held by different [[credit bureau]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksv.at/KSV/1870/de/4privatpersonen/4fragenantworten/index.html |title=Fragen & Antworten |accessdate=31 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101180603/http://www.ksv.at/KSV/1870/de/4privatpersonen/4fragenantworten/index.html |archive-date=1 January 2011 |df= }}</ref> Having an entry on the black list may result in the denial of contracts. Certain enterprises including telecom carriers use the list on a regular basis. Banks also use these lists, but rather inquire about security and income when considering loans. Beside these lists several agencies and credit bureaus provide credit scoring of consumers.\n\nAccording to the [[Data Protection Directive|Austrian Data Protection Act]], consumers must opt-in for the use of their private data for any purpose. Consumers can also withhold permission to use the data later, making illegal any further distribution or use of the collected data.<ref>\u00a7 8 Abs 1 Z2 DSG</ref> Consumers also have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year.<ref>\u00a7 26 DSG</ref> Wrong or unlawfully collected data must be deleted or corrected.<ref>\u00a7\u00a7 27 and 28 DSG</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\nCredit scoring is relatively new in Brazil. Previously, credit reporting was done as a blacklist and each lender used to assess potential borrowers on their own criteria. Nowadays, the system of credit reports and scores in Brazil is very similar to that in the United States.\n\nA credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit information, which represents the creditworthiness of that person. It is the most important tool used by financial institutions during a credit analysis that aims to assist the decision-making process of granting credit and conducting business, in order to verify the likelihood that people will pay their bills. A credit score is primarily based on credit report information, typically from one of the three major credit bureaus: [[Experian|Serasa Experian]], [[:pt:Boa Vista Servi\u00e7os|Boa Vista]] (previously [[Equifax|Equifax do Brasil]]) and [[SPC Brasil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foregon.com/blog/voce-sabe-o-que-e-score/|title=Score de cr\u00e9dito: o que \u00e9 e como ele funciona|first=Leonardo|last=Jacomini|date=9 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are different methods of calculating credit scores in Brazil. In general, scores range from 0 to 1000 indicating what is the chance of a certain profile of consumers paying their bills on time in the next 12 months. The score is calculated from several factors, but practically it analyzes a person's trajectory as a consumer, what includes up to date payments of bills, history of negative debts, financial relationships with companies and updated personal data on credit protection agencies, such as Serasa Experian, Boa Vista, SPC, Quod and Foregon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.serasaconsumidor.com.br/ensina/ver-o-score-e-gratis/ |title=Tudo sobre score de cr\u00e9dito |language=es |trans-title=All about credit score |access-date=29 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529030645/https://www.serasaconsumidor.com.br/ensina/ver-o-score-e-gratis/ |archive-date=29 May 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://quickbooks.intuit.com/br/blog/conceitos-financas/entenda-como-funciona-o-score-de-credito-do-consumidor|title=Entenda Como Funciona o Score de Cr\u00e9dito do Consumidor|date=24 April 2015|website=QuickBooks}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThe system of credit reports and scores in Canada is very similar to that in the United States and India, with two of the same reporting agencies active in the country:  [[Equifax]] and [[TransUnion]]. ([[Experian]], which entered the Canadian market with the purchase of Northern Credit Bureaus in 2008, announced the closing of its Canadian operations as of 18 April 2009).\n\nThere are, however, some key differences. One is that, unlike in the United States, where a consumer is allowed only one free copy of their credit report a year, in Canada, the consumer may order a free copy of their credit report any number of times in a year, as long as the request is made in writing, and as long as the consumer asks for a printed copy to be delivered by mail.<ref>[http://www.equifax.com/ecm/canada/EFXCreditReportRequestForm.pdf Equifax form] (Canada)</ref><ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/household-finances/its-easy-to-get-a-free-credit-report-honest/article620190/ TransUnion form] (Canada)</ref> Borrowell and CreditKarma offers free credit report and credit check and this request by the consumer is noted in the credit report as a 'soft inquiry', so it has no effect on their credit score. According to Equifax's ScorePower Report, Equifax Beacon scores range from 300 to 900. Trans Union Emperica scores also range from 300 and 900.\n\nThe Government of [[Canada]] offers a free publication called ''Understanding Your Credit Report and Credit Score''.<ref>[http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/resources/publications/creditLoans/Pages/Understa-Comprend.aspx Understanding Your Credit Report and Credit Score] (Canada)</ref>  This publication provides sample credit report and credit score documents, with explanations of the notations and codes that are used. It also contains general information on how to build or improve credit history, and how to check for signs that [[identity theft]] has occurred. The publication is available online at the [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]. Paper copies can also be ordered at no charge for residents of Canada.\n\n===China===\nPrivate companies have developed credit score systems, these systems include [[Sesame Credit]], which is provided by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/16/china-social-credit-system-ant-financials-sesame-credit-and-others-give-scores-that-go-beyond-fico.html|title=FICO with Chinese characteristics: Nice rewards, but punishing penalties|last=Ming|first=Cheang|date=2017|website=CNBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tencent|Tencent Credit]]. Part of the government's [[Social Credit System]] uses credit information about citizens.\n\n===Denmark===\nThe credit scoring is widely used in Denmark by the banks and a number of private companies within telco and others. The credit scoring is split in two:\n* Private: The probability of defaulting\n* Businesses: The probability of bankruptcy\nFor privates, the credit scoring is always made by the creditor. For businesses it is either made by the creditor or by a third party.\n\nThere are a few companies who have specialized in developing credit scorecards in Denmark:\n* [[Experian]] (generic rating for business)\n* [[Bisnode]] (generic rating for business)\n\nThe credit scorecards in Denmark are mainly based on information provided by the applicant and publicly available data. It is very restricted by legislation compared to its neighbouring countries.\n\n===Germany===\n\nIn Germany, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.\n\nConsumers have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year. At present [[Schufa]], the main provider of credit file data, provides scores for about three-quarters of the German population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9343.html|title=Lecture: Court in the Akten &#124; Sunday &#124; Schedule 35th Chaos Communication Congress|website=fahrplan.events.ccc.de}}</ref>\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], there are four credit information companies licensed by [[Reserve Bank of India]]. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited ([[CIBIL]]) has functioned as a Credit Information Company from January 2001.<ref name=\"Reserve Bank of India\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5540&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> Subsequently, in 2010, [[Experian]],<ref name=\"Reserve Bank of India\"/> [[Equifax]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5598&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> and [[CRIF High Mark Credit Information Services|CRIF High Mark]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=6137&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> were given licenses by [[Reserve Bank of India]] to operate as Credit Information Companies in India.\n\nAlthough all the four credit information companies have developed their individual credit scores, the most popular is [[CIBIL]] credit score. The [[CIBIL]] credit score is a three  digit number that represents a summary of individuals' credit history and credit rating. This score ranges from 300 to 900, with 900 being the best score. Individuals with no credit history will have a score of -1. If the credit history is less than six months, the score will be 0. [[CIBIL]] credit score takes time to build up and usually it takes between 18 and 36 months or more of credit usage to obtain a satisfactory credit score.\n\n===Norway===\nIn [[Norway]], credit scoring services are provided by three credit scoring agencies: [[Dun & Bradstreet]], [[Experian]] and Lindorff Decision. Credit scoring is based on publicly available information such as demographic data, tax returns, taxable income and any ''Betalingsanmerkning'' (non-payment records) that might be registered on the credit-scored individual. Upon being scored, an individual will receive a notice (written or by e-mail) from the scoring agency stating who performed the credit score as well as any information provided in the score. In addition, many credit institutions use custom scorecards based on any number of parameters. Credit scores range between 300 and 999.\n\n===South Africa===\nCredit scoring is used throughout the credit industry in [[South Africa]], with the likes of banks, micro-lenders, clothing retailers, furniture retailers, specialized lenders and insurers all using credit scores.  Currently all four retail [[credit bureau]] offer credit bureau scores.  The data stored by the credit bureaus include both positive and negative data, increasing the predictive power of the individual scores.  [[TransUnion]] (formerly ITC) offer the Empirica Score which is, as of mid-2010, in its 4th generation.  The Empirica score is segmented into two suites: the account origination (AO) and account management (AM).  [[Experian]] South Africa likewise has a Delphi credit score with their fourth generation about to be released (late 2010). In 2011, [[Compuscan]] released Compuscore ABC, a scoring suite which predicts the probability of customer default throughout the credit life cycle. Six years later, Compuscan introduced Compuscore PSY, a 3-digit psychometric-based credit bureau score used by lenders to make informed lending decisions on thin files or marginal declines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.compuscan.co.za/introducing-newest-service-offering-compuscore-psy/|title=Introducing our newest service offering: Compuscore PSY|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nAccording to the provisions of Credit Information Bureau Act No 18 of 1990 (as amended by Act No 42 of 2008), [[Credit Information Bureau, Inc.|CRIB]] has been delegated with power to issue credit reports to any subject to whom that information is related to. The Bureau commenced to issue Self Inquiry Credit Reports in December 2009.<ref>[http://www.crib.lk/en/index.php/customer-help-desk/obtain-your-own-credit-report Crib.lk] (Sri Lanks)</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\nSweden has a system for credit scoring that aims to find people with a history of neglect to pay bills or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make payments after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish [[Enforcement Authority]] which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a ''Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning'' (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company.<ref>{{cite web|title=Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning|url=https://www.kronofogden.se/Betalningsanmarkning2.html|website=kronofogden.se|publisher=[[Enforcement Authority]]|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> This kind of nonpayment record will make it very difficult to get a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where you handle cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Liljemalm|first1=Anna|title=S\u00e5 minskar skulder chansen att f\u00e5 l\u00e4genhet|trans-title=Debts reduce chances to get an apartment|url=http://www.gp.se/ekonomi/1.2618214-sa-minskar-skulder-chansen-att-fa-lagenhet|website=gp.se|publisher=[[G\u00f6teborgs-Posten]]|date=3 February 2015|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIf a person gets an injunction to pay issued by the Enforcement Authority, it is possible to dispute it. Then the party requesting the payment must show its correctness in district court. Failure to dispute is seen as admitting the debt. If the debtor loses the court trial, costs for the trial are added to the debt. Taxes and authority fees must always be paid on demand unless payment has already been made.\n\nEvery person with a Swedish [[national identification number]] must register a valid address, even if living abroad, since sent letters are considered to have been delivered to that person once they reach the registered address. As an example, Swedish astronaut [[Christer Fuglesang]] got a ''Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning'' since a car he had ordered, and therefore owned, passed a toll station for the [[Stockholm congestion tax]]. At the time, he was living in the USA training for his first [[STS-116|Space Shuttle mission]] and had an old invalid address registered for the car. Letters with payment requests did not reach him on time. The case was appealed and retracted, but the non-payment record remained for three years since it could not be retracted according to the law.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Olsson|first1=Caroline|title=Fuglesang hamnar hos kronofogden|trans-title=Fuglesang at the Swedish Enforcement Administration|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article11372512.ab|website=aftonbladet.se|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Credit scorecards}}\nCredit scoring in the United Kingdom is very different to that of the United States and other nations. There is no such thing as a universal credit score or credit rating in the UK. Each lender will assess potential borrowers on their own criteria, and these algorithms are effectively trade secrets.<ref>https://www.equifax.co.uk/resources/loans_and_credit/credit-myths-the-truth-about-credit.html</ref>\n\n\"Credit scores\" which are available for individuals to see and provided from [[Credit Reference Agencies]] such as Call Credit, [[Equifax]], [[Experian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/video/heres-what-your-credit-score-is-according-to-an-experian-executive-14819049|title=Here's What Your Credit Score Is According to an Experian Executive|first=Katherine|last=Ross|date=27 December 2018|website=TheStreet}}</ref> and [[TransUnion]] are marketed to consumers and are not usually used by lenders. Most lenders instead use their own internal scoring mechanism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe most popular statistical technique used is [[logistic regression]] to predict a binary outcome: bad debt or no bad debt.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Some banks also build regression models that predict the amount of bad debt a customer may incur. Typically this is much harder to predict, and most banks focus only on the binary outcome.\n\nCredit scoring is closely regulated only by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] when used for the purposes of the Advanced approach to Capital Adequacy under [[Basel II]] regulations.\n\nCredit scoring is closely regulated in the UK, with the industry regulator being the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). Consumers can also send complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service if they experience problems with any Credit Reference Agency.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hulland|first=Louise|title=Credit Reference Agencies|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mg74/features/credit-reference-agency|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIt is very difficult for a consumer to know in advance whether they have a high enough credit score to be accepted for credit with a given lender.  This situation is due to the complexity and structure of credit scoring, which differs from one lender to another.\n\nLenders need not reveal their credit score head, nor need they reveal the minimum credit score required for the applicant to be accepted, because there may not be such a minimum score.\n\nIf the applicant is declined for credit, the lender is not obliged to reveal the exact reason why. However industry associations including the [[Finance and Leasing Association]] oblige their members to provide a satisfactory reason. Credit-bureau data sharing agreements also require that an applicant declined based on credit-bureau data is told that this is the reason and the address of the credit bureau must be provided.\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Credit score in the United States}}\nIn the United States, a credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit files, that in theory represents the [[creditworthiness]] of that person, which is the likelihood that people will pay their bills.  A credit score is primarily based on [[credit report]] information, typically from one of the three major [[credit bureau]]s: [[Experian]], [[TransUnion]], and [[Equifax]]. Income and employment history (or lack thereof) are not considered by the major credit bureaus when calculating credit scores.\n\nThere are different methods of calculating credit scores. [[FICO score]]s, the most widely used type of credit score, is a credit score developed by [[FICO]], previously known as [[Fair Isaac|Fair Isaac Corporation]].  As of 2018, there are currently 29 different versions of FICO scores in use in the United States. Some of these versions are \"industry specific\" scores, that is, scores produced for particular market segments, including automotive lending and bankcard (credit card) lending. Industry-specific FICO scores produced for automotive lending are formulated differently than FICO scores produced for bankcard lending. Nearly every consumer will have different FICO scores depending upon which type of FICO score is ordered by a lender; for example, a consumer with several paid-in-full car loans but no reported credit card payment history will generally score better on a FICO automotive-enhanced score than on a FICO bankcard-enhanced score. FICO also produces several \"general purpose\" scores which are not tailored to any particular industry. Industry-specific FICO scores range from 250 to 900, whereas general purpose scores range from 300 to 850.\n\nFICO scores are used by many mortgage lenders that use a risk-based system to determine the possibility that the borrower may default on financial obligations to the mortgage lender. For most mortgages originated in the United States, three credit scores are obtained on a consumer: a Beacon 5.0 score (Beacon is a trademark of FICO) which is calculated from the consumer's Equifax credit history, a FICO Model II score, which is calculated from the consumer's Experian credit history, and a Classic04 score, which is calculated from the consumer's Trans Union history.\n\n[[Credit bureau]]s also often re-sell FICO scores directly to consumers, often a general-purpose FICO 8 score. Previously, the credit bureaus also sold their own credit scores which they developed themselves, and which did not require payment to FICO to utilize: [[Equifax]]'s RISK score and [[Experian]]'s PLUS score. However, as of 2018, these scores are no longer sold by the credit bureaus. Trans Union offers a Vantage 3.0 score for sale to consumers, which is a version of the [[VantageScore]] credit score. In addition, many large lenders, including the major credit card issuers, have developed their own proprietary scoring models.\n\nStudies have shown scores to be predictive of risk in the underwriting of both credit and insurance.<ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/RptCongress/creditscore/creditscore.pdf Report to the Congress on credit scoring and its effects on the availability and affordability of credit]</ref><ref name=insurance>[http://www2.ftc.gov/os/2007/07/P044804FACTA_Report_Credit-Based_Insurance_Scores.pdf Credit-based insurance scores: Impacts on consumers of automobile insurance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511204147/http://ftc.gov/os/2007/07/P044804FACTA_Report_Credit-Based_Insurance_Scores.pdf |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iii.org/media/presentations/creditscoringtexas/|title=No Evidence of Disparate Impact in Texas Due to Use of Credit Information by Personal Lines Insurers - III|author=|date=|website=iii.org}}</ref>  Some studies even suggest that most consumers are the beneficiaries of lower credit costs and insurance premiums due to the use of credit scores.<ref name=insurance/><ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2003/0203lead.pdf An overview of consumer data and credit reporting]</ref>\n\nNew credit scores have been developed in the last decade by companies such as Scorelogix, [[PRBC (company)|PRBC]], L2C, [[Innovis]] etc. which do not use bureau data to predict creditworthiness. Scorelogix's JSS Credit Score uses a different set of risk factors, such as the borrower's job stability, income, income sufficiency, and impact of economy, in predicting credit risk, and the use of such alternative credit scores is on the rise. These new types of credit scores are often combined with FICO or bureau scores to improve the accuracy of predictions. Most lenders today use some combination of bureau scores and alternative credit scores to develop better understanding of a borrower's ability to pay.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIt is widely recognized that FICO is a measure of past ability to pay. New credit scores that focus more on future ability to pay are being deployed to enhance credit risk models. L2C offers an alternative credit score that uses utility payment histories to determine creditworthiness, and many lenders use this score in addition to bureau scores to make lending decisions. Many lenders use Scorelogix's JSS score in addition to bureau scores, given that the JSS score incorporates job and income stability to determine whether the borrower will have the ability to repay debt in the future. It is thought that the FICO score will remain the dominant score, but it will likely be used in conjunction with other alternative credit scores that offer other pictures of risk.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nUsage of credit histories in employment screenings has increased from 19% in 1996 to 42% in 2006.<ref name=wernau>{{cite news|last=Wernau|first=Julie|title=TransUnion battling attempts to ban employment credit checks|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-04-28/business/ct-biz-0429-credit-checks-transunion--20100428_1_credit-checks-transunion-credit-bureaus|accessdate=23 October 2011|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=28 April 2010}}</ref>{{rp|1}}  However, credit reports for employment screening purposes do not include credit scores.<ref name=wernau />{{rp|2}}\n\nAmericans are entitled to one free credit report in every 12-month period from each of the three credit bureaus, but are not entitled to receive a free credit score. The three credit bureaus run [[Annualcreditreport.com]], where users can get their free credit reports. Credit scores are available as an add-on feature of the report for a fee. If the consumer disputes an item on a credit report obtained using the free system, under the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (FCRA), the credit bureaus have 45 days to investigate, rather than 30 days for reports obtained otherwise.<ref>[http://www.equifax.com/answers/correct-credit-report-errors/en_cp Equifax Credit Report Dispute FAQs] retrieved on 18 December 2008</ref>\n\nAlternatively, consumers wishing to obtain their credit scores can in some cases purchase them separately from the credit bureaus or can purchase their FICO score directly from [[FICO]]. Credit scores (including FICO scores) are also made available free by subscription to one of the many [[credit report monitoring]] services available from the credit bureaus or other third parties, although to actually get the scores free from most such services, one must use a credit card to sign up for a free trial subscription of the service and then cancel before the first monthly charge. Websites like [[WalletHub]], [[Credit Sesame]] and [[Credit Karma]] provide free credit scores with no credit card required, using the [[TransUnion]] VantageScore 3.0 model. Credit.com uses the [[Experian]] VantageScore 3.0 model. Until March 2009, holders of credit cards issued by [[Washington Mutual]] were offered a free FICO score each month through the bank's Web site. ([[Chase (bank)|Chase]], which took over Washington Mutual in 2008, discontinued this practice in March 2009.)<ref>[http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/cc/credit-card-update.asp Chase drops WaMu secured card, FICO score] retrieved on 17 January 2009</ref> [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] resumed the practice of offering a free FICO score in March 2010 of select card members to the exclusion of the majority of former WAMU card holders.\n\nUnder the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], a consumer is entitled to a free credit report (but not a free credit score) within 60 days of any adverse action (e.g., being denied credit, or receiving substandard credit terms from a lender) taken as a result of their credit score. Under the [[Wall Street reform]] bill passed on 22 July 2010, a consumer is entitled to receive a free credit score if they are denied a loan or insurance due to their credit score.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/07/15/president-obama-final-passage-wall-street-reform-end-bailouts-a-beginning-accountabi President Obama on Final Passage of Wall Street Reform: An End to Bailouts, a Beginning for Accountability] published 15 July 2010, retrieved on 26 July 2010.</ref>\n\nThe generic or classic FICO credit score ranges between 300 and 850. The VantageScore 3.0 score ranges from 300-850. The old VantageScore was between 501 and 990.\n\nThe first step to interpreting a score is to identify the source of the credit score and its use. There are numerous scores based on various scoring models sold to lenders and other users. The most common was created by FICO and is called FICO score. [[FICO]] is a publicly traded corporation (under the ticker symbol FICO) that created the best-known and most widely used credit score model in the United States. FICO produces scoring models which are installed at and distributed by the three largest national credit repositories in the U.S (TransUnion, Equifax and Experian) and the two national credit repositories in Canada (TransUnion Canada and Equifax Canada).  FICO controls the vast majority of the credit score market in the United States and Canada although there are several other competing players that collectively share a very small percentage of the market.\n\nIn the United States, the [[median]] generic FICO score was 723 in 2006 and 711 in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fico.com/en/blogs/tag/score-distributions/|title=Score Distributions|author=|date=|website=FICO}}</ref>  The performance definition of the FICO risk score (its stated design objective) is to predict the likelihood that a consumer will go 90 days past due or worse in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated.  The higher the consumer's score, the less likely he or she will go 90 days past due in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated.  Because different lending uses (mortgage, automobile, credit card) have different parameters, FICO algorithms are adjusted according to the predictability of that use.  For this reason, a person might have a higher credit score for a revolving credit card debt when compared to a mortgage credit score taken at the same point in time.\n\nThe interpretation of a credit score will vary by lender, industry, and the economy as a whole.  While 640 has been a divider between \"prime\" and \"subprime\", all considerations about score revolve around the strength of the economy in general and investors' appetites for risk in providing the funding for borrowers in particular when the score is evaluated.  In 2010, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) tightened its guidelines regarding credit scores to a small degree, but lenders who have to service and sell the securities packaged for sale into the secondary market largely raised their minimum score to 640 in the absence of strong compensating factors in the borrower's loan profile.  In another housing example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began charging extra for loans over 75% of the value that have scores below 740. Furthermore, private mortgage insurance companies will not even provide mortgage insurance for borrowers with scores below 660. Therefore, \"prime\" is a product of the lender's appetite for the risk profile of the borrower at the time that the borrower is asking for the loan.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nSeveral factors affect individual's credit scores. One factor is the amount an individual borrowed as compared to the amount of credit available to the individual. As an individual borrows, or leverages, more money, the individual's credit score decreases.\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\nCredit Scores in UAE are issued by AECB, a Federal Government-held company. Individual Credit Scores are three-digit numbers used to predict the likelihood of an individual making their loan and credit card payments on time, based on previous credit and payment behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moneymall.ae/credit-score/|title=Credit Score in UAE|last=|first=|date=|website=moneymall.ae|publisher='MoneyMall' leading personal finance portal in UAE|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=22 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Credit Score number in UAE ranges from 300 to 900. A low score indicates a higher risk, whereas a higher score indicates a lower risk.\n\nIssuer of Credit Score is Al Etihad Credit Bureau.  its a Public Joint Stock Company wholly owned by the UAE Federal Government. As per UAE Federal Law No. (6) of 2010 concerning Credit Information, the company is mandated to regularly collect credit information from financial and non-financial institutions in the UAE.\n\nAl Etihad Credit Bureau aggregates and analyzes this data to calculate Credit Scores and produce Credit Reports that are made available to individuals and companies in the UAE.\n\nCredit Scoring is relatively new in UAE, But All major banks started using the same which shows its high importance hence\n\n<br />\n\n=== '''DUBAI''' ===\n\n\nA Credit Score in UAE is used to measure the credit worthiness of an individual. It shows the ability or the intention of an individual to pay back the amount borrowed. It is an accumulative report based on the past lending and repayment history. A Credit Score in UAE is represented by 3 digit number ranging between 300-900, where 300 is considered as the lowest and 900 as the highest. Higher the Credit Score, higher the chances of getting your credit facility approved.

A credit score is primarily based on a [[credit report]], information typically sourced from [[credit bureau]]s.\n\nLenders, such as [[bank]]s and credit card companies, use credit scores to evaluate the potential risk posed by lending money to consumers and to mitigate losses due to [[bad debt]].  Lenders use credit scores to determine who qualifies for a loan, at what [[interest rate]], and what credit limits.  Lenders also use credit scores to determine which customers are likely to bring in the most revenue. The use of credit or [[identity scoring]] prior to authorizing access or granting credit is an implementation of a [[trusted system]].\n\nCredit scoring is not limited to banks. Other organizations, such as mobile phone companies, insurance companies, landlords, and government departments employ the same techniques. Digital finance companies such as online lenders also use alternative data sources to calculate the creditworthiness of borrowers.\n\n==By country==\n\n===Australia===\n\nIn Australia, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.\n\nAlthough [[logistic function|logistic]] (or [[non-linear]]) probability modelling is still the most popular means by which to develop scorecards, various other methods offer powerful alternatives, including [[Multivariate adaptive regression splines|MARS]], [[Predictive analytics#Classification and regression trees|CART]], [[CHAID]], and [[random forest]]s.\n\nPrior to 12 March 2014 [[Veda Advantage]], the main provider of credit file data, provided only a negative credit reporting system containing information on applications for credit and adverse listings indicating a default under a credit contract. Veda was acquired by Equifax in Feb 2016,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.equifax.com.au/news-media/equifax-completes-acquisition-australias-leading-credit-information-company-veda-group|title=Equifax Completes Acquisition of Australia\u2019s Leading Credit Information Company, Veda Group Limited, for Total Consideration of USD$1.9 Billion|date=25 February 2016|work=Equifax Australia|access-date=6 March 2018|language=en}}</ref> making Equifax the largest credit agency in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/52.%20Overview%3A%20Credit%20Reporting/credit-reporting-agencies|title=Credit reporting agencies|last=Anonymous|date=17 August 2010|language=en|access-date=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith the subsequent introduction of positive reporting, lending companies have begun an uptake of its usage with some implementing [[Risk-based pricing|risk based pricing]] to set lending rates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=McGeorge|first1=Noah|title=fico ratings|url=https://aaacreditguide.com/fico-credit-score-range/|accessdate=28 February 2013|agency=Barff|issue=Atlanta|publisher=Marcus Arnold}}</ref>\n\n===Austria===\nIn [[Austria]], credit scoring is done as a blacklist. Consumers who did not pay bills end up on the blacklists that are held by different [[credit bureau]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ksv.at/KSV/1870/de/4privatpersonen/4fragenantworten/index.html |title=Fragen & Antworten |accessdate=31 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101180603/http://www.ksv.at/KSV/1870/de/4privatpersonen/4fragenantworten/index.html |archive-date=1 January 2011 |df= }}</ref> Having an entry on the black list may result in the denial of contracts. Certain enterprises including telecom carriers use the list on a regular basis. Banks also use these lists, but rather inquire about security and income when considering loans. Beside these lists several agencies and credit bureaus provide credit scoring of consumers.\n\nAccording to the [[Data Protection Directive|Austrian Data Protection Act]], consumers must opt-in for the use of their private data for any purpose. Consumers can also withhold permission to use the data later, making illegal any further distribution or use of the collected data.<ref>\u00a7 8 Abs 1 Z2 DSG</ref> Consumers also have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year.<ref>\u00a7 26 DSG</ref> Wrong or unlawfully collected data must be deleted or corrected.<ref>\u00a7\u00a7 27 and 28 DSG</ref>\n\n===Brazil===\nCredit scoring is relatively new in Brazil. Previously, credit reporting was done as a blacklist and each lender used to assess potential borrowers on their own criteria. Nowadays, the system of credit reports and scores in Brazil is very similar to that in the United States.\n\nA credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit information, which represents the creditworthiness of that person. It is the most important tool used by financial institutions during a credit analysis that aims to assist the decision-making process of granting credit and conducting business, in order to verify the likelihood that people will pay their bills. A credit score is primarily based on credit report information, typically from one of the three major credit bureaus: [[Experian|Serasa Experian]], [[:pt:Boa Vista Servi\u00e7os|Boa Vista]] (previously [[Equifax|Equifax do Brasil]]) and [[SPC Brasil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.foregon.com/blog/voce-sabe-o-que-e-score/|title=Score de cr\u00e9dito: o que \u00e9 e como ele funciona|first=Leonardo|last=Jacomini|date=9 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nThere are different methods of calculating credit scores in Brazil. In general, scores range from 0 to 1000 indicating what is the chance of a certain profile of consumers paying their bills on time in the next 12 months. The score is calculated from several factors, but practically it analyzes a person's trajectory as a consumer, what includes up to date payments of bills, history of negative debts, financial relationships with companies and updated personal data on credit protection agencies, such as Serasa Experian, Boa Vista, SPC, Quod and Foregon.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.serasaconsumidor.com.br/ensina/ver-o-score-e-gratis/ |title=Tudo sobre score de cr\u00e9dito |language=es |trans-title=All about credit score |access-date=29 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190529030645/https://www.serasaconsumidor.com.br/ensina/ver-o-score-e-gratis/ |archive-date=29 May 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://quickbooks.intuit.com/br/blog/conceitos-financas/entenda-como-funciona-o-score-de-credito-do-consumidor|title=Entenda Como Funciona o Score de Cr\u00e9dito do Consumidor|date=24 April 2015|website=QuickBooks}}</ref>\n\n===Canada===\nThe system of credit reports and scores in Canada is very similar to that in the United States and India, with two of the same reporting agencies active in the country:  [[Equifax]] and [[TransUnion]]. ([[Experian]], which entered the Canadian market with the purchase of Northern Credit Bureaus in 2008, announced the closing of its Canadian operations as of 18 April 2009).\n\nThere are, however, some key differences. One is that, unlike in the United States, where a consumer is allowed only one free copy of their credit report a year, in Canada, the consumer may order a free copy of their credit report any number of times in a year, as long as the request is made in writing, and as long as the consumer asks for a printed copy to be delivered by mail.<ref>[http://www.equifax.com/ecm/canada/EFXCreditReportRequestForm.pdf Equifax form] (Canada)</ref><ref>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/personal-finance/household-finances/its-easy-to-get-a-free-credit-report-honest/article620190/ TransUnion form] (Canada)</ref> Borrowell and CreditKarma offers free credit report and credit check and this request by the consumer is noted in the credit report as a 'soft inquiry', so it has no effect on their credit score. According to Equifax's ScorePower Report, Equifax Beacon scores range from 300 to 900. Trans Union Emperica scores also range from 300 and 900.\n\nThe Government of [[Canada]] offers a free publication called ''Understanding Your Credit Report and Credit Score''.<ref>[http://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/eng/resources/publications/creditLoans/Pages/Understa-Comprend.aspx Understanding Your Credit Report and Credit Score] (Canada)</ref>  This publication provides sample credit report and credit score documents, with explanations of the notations and codes that are used. It also contains general information on how to build or improve credit history, and how to check for signs that [[identity theft]] has occurred. The publication is available online at the [[Financial Consumer Agency of Canada]]. Paper copies can also be ordered at no charge for residents of Canada.\n\n===China===\nPrivate companies have developed credit score systems, these systems include [[Sesame Credit]], which is provided by Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/16/china-social-credit-system-ant-financials-sesame-credit-and-others-give-scores-that-go-beyond-fico.html|title=FICO with Chinese characteristics: Nice rewards, but punishing penalties|last=Ming|first=Cheang|date=2017|website=CNBC|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tencent|Tencent Credit]]. Part of the government's [[Social Credit System]] uses credit information about citizens.\n\n===Denmark===\nThe credit scoring is widely used in Denmark by the banks and a number of private companies within telco and others. The credit scoring is split in two:\n* Private: The probability of defaulting\n* Businesses: The probability of bankruptcy\nFor privates, the credit scoring is always made by the creditor. For businesses it is either made by the creditor or by a third party.\n\nThere are a few companies who have specialized in developing credit scorecards in Denmark:\n* [[Experian]] (generic rating for business)\n* [[Bisnode]] (generic rating for business)\n\nThe credit scorecards in Denmark are mainly based on information provided by the applicant and publicly available data. It is very restricted by legislation compared to its neighbouring countries.\n\n===Germany===\n\nIn Germany, credit scoring is widely accepted as the primary method of assessing creditworthiness. Credit scoring is used not only to determine whether credit should be approved to an applicant, but for credit scoring in the setting of credit limits on credit or store cards, in behavioral modelling such as collections scoring, and also in the pre-approval of additional credit to a company's existing client base.\n\nConsumers have the right to receive a free copy of all data held by credit bureaus once a year. At present [[Schufa]], the main provider of credit file data, provides scores for about three-quarters of the German population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fahrplan.events.ccc.de/congress/2018/Fahrplan/events/9343.html|title=Lecture: Court in the Akten &#124; Sunday &#124; Schedule 35th Chaos Communication Congress|website=fahrplan.events.ccc.de}}</ref>\n\n===India===\nIn [[India]], there are four credit information companies licensed by [[Reserve Bank of India]]. The Credit Information Bureau (India) Limited ([[CIBIL]]) has functioned as a Credit Information Company from January 2001.<ref name=\"Reserve Bank of India\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5540&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> Subsequently, in 2010, [[Experian]],<ref name=\"Reserve Bank of India\"/> [[Equifax]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=5598&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> and [[CRIF High Mark Credit Information Services|CRIF High Mark]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=6137&Mode=0|title=Reserve Bank of India|author=|date=|website=rbi.org.in}}</ref> were given licenses by [[Reserve Bank of India]] to operate as Credit Information Companies in India.\n\nAlthough all the four credit information companies have developed their individual credit scores, the most popular is [[CIBIL]] credit score. The [[CIBIL]] credit score is a three  digit number that represents a summary of individuals' credit history and credit rating. This score ranges from 300 to 900, with 900 being the best score. Individuals with no credit history will have a score of -1. If the credit history is less than six months, the score will be 0. [[CIBIL]] credit score takes time to build up and usually it takes between 18 and 36 months or more of credit usage to obtain a satisfactory credit score.\n\n===Norway===\nIn [[Norway]], credit scoring services are provided by three credit scoring agencies: [[Dun & Bradstreet]], [[Experian]] and Lindorff Decision. Credit scoring is based on publicly available information such as demographic data, tax returns, taxable income and any ''Betalingsanmerkning'' (non-payment records) that might be registered on the credit-scored individual. Upon being scored, an individual will receive a notice (written or by e-mail) from the scoring agency stating who performed the credit score as well as any information provided in the score. In addition, many credit institutions use custom scorecards based on any number of parameters. Credit scores range between 300 and 999.\n\n===South Africa===\nCredit scoring is used throughout the credit industry in [[South Africa]], with the likes of banks, micro-lenders, clothing retailers, furniture retailers, specialized lenders and insurers all using credit scores.  Currently all four retail [[credit bureau]] offer credit bureau scores.  The data stored by the credit bureaus include both positive and negative data, increasing the predictive power of the individual scores.  [[TransUnion]] (formerly ITC) offer the Empirica Score which is, as of mid-2010, in its 4th generation.  The Empirica score is segmented into two suites: the account origination (AO) and account management (AM).  [[Experian]] South Africa likewise has a Delphi credit score with their fourth generation about to be released (late 2010). In 2011, [[Compuscan]] released Compuscore ABC, a scoring suite which predicts the probability of customer default throughout the credit life cycle. Six years later, Compuscan introduced Compuscore PSY, a 3-digit psychometric-based credit bureau score used by lenders to make informed lending decisions on thin files or marginal declines.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.compuscan.co.za/introducing-newest-service-offering-compuscore-psy/|title=Introducing our newest service offering: Compuscore PSY|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|access-date=11 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nAccording to the provisions of Credit Information Bureau Act No 18 of 1990 (as amended by Act No 42 of 2008), [[Credit Information Bureau, Inc.|CRIB]] has been delegated with power to issue credit reports to any subject to whom that information is related to. The Bureau commenced to issue Self Inquiry Credit Reports in December 2009.<ref>[http://www.crib.lk/en/index.php/customer-help-desk/obtain-your-own-credit-report Crib.lk] (Sri Lanks)</ref>\n\n=== Sweden ===\nSweden has a system for credit scoring that aims to find people with a history of neglect to pay bills or, most commonly, taxes. Anyone who does not pay their debts on time, and fails to make payments after a reminder, will have their case forwarded to the Swedish [[Enforcement Authority]] which is a national authority for collecting debts. The mere appearance of a company, or government office, as a debtor to this authority will result in a record among private credit bureaus; however, this does not apply to individuals as debtors. This record is called a ''Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning'' (non-payment record) and by law can be stored for three years for an individual and five years for a company.<ref>{{cite web|title=Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning|url=https://www.kronofogden.se/Betalningsanmarkning2.html|website=kronofogden.se|publisher=[[Enforcement Authority]]|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref> This kind of nonpayment record will make it very difficult to get a loan, rent an apartment, get telephone subscriptions, rent a car or get a job where you handle cash. The banks, also use income and asset figures in connection with loan assessments.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Liljemalm|first1=Anna|title=S\u00e5 minskar skulder chansen att f\u00e5 l\u00e4genhet|trans-title=Debts reduce chances to get an apartment|url=http://www.gp.se/ekonomi/1.2618214-sa-minskar-skulder-chansen-att-fa-lagenhet|website=gp.se|publisher=[[G\u00f6teborgs-Posten]]|date=3 February 2015|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nIf a person gets an injunction to pay issued by the Enforcement Authority, it is possible to dispute it. Then the party requesting the payment must show its correctness in district court. Failure to dispute is seen as admitting the debt. If the debtor loses the court trial, costs for the trial are added to the debt. Taxes and authority fees must always be paid on demand unless payment has already been made.\n\nEvery person with a Swedish [[national identification number]] must register a valid address, even if living abroad, since sent letters are considered to have been delivered to that person once they reach the registered address. As an example, Swedish astronaut [[Christer Fuglesang]] got a ''Betalningsanm\u00e4rkning'' since a car he had ordered, and therefore owned, passed a toll station for the [[Stockholm congestion tax]]. At the time, he was living in the USA training for his first [[STS-116|Space Shuttle mission]] and had an old invalid address registered for the car. Letters with payment requests did not reach him on time. The case was appealed and retracted, but the non-payment record remained for three years since it could not be retracted according to the law.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Olsson|first1=Caroline|title=Fuglesang hamnar hos kronofogden|trans-title=Fuglesang at the Swedish Enforcement Administration|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article11372512.ab|website=aftonbladet.se|publisher=[[Aftonbladet]]|date=17 March 2008|accessdate=16 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n===United Kingdom===\n{{See also|Credit scorecards}}\nCredit scoring in the United Kingdom is very different to that of the United States and other nations. There is no such thing as a universal credit score or credit rating in the UK. Each lender will assess potential borrowers on their own criteria, and these algorithms are effectively trade secrets.<ref>https://www.equifax.co.uk/resources/loans_and_credit/credit-myths-the-truth-about-credit.html</ref>\n\n\"Credit scores\" which are available for individuals to see and provided from [[Credit Reference Agencies]] such as Call Credit, [[Equifax]], [[Experian]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/video/heres-what-your-credit-score-is-according-to-an-experian-executive-14819049|title=Here's What Your Credit Score Is According to an Experian Executive|first=Katherine|last=Ross|date=27 December 2018|website=TheStreet}}</ref> and [[TransUnion]] are marketed to consumers and are not usually used by lenders. Most lenders instead use their own internal scoring mechanism.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe most popular statistical technique used is [[logistic regression]] to predict a binary outcome: bad debt or no bad debt.{{fact|date=January 2020}} Some banks also build regression models that predict the amount of bad debt a customer may incur. Typically this is much harder to predict, and most banks focus only on the binary outcome.\n\nCredit scoring is closely regulated only by the [[Financial Conduct Authority]] when used for the purposes of the Advanced approach to Capital Adequacy under [[Basel II]] regulations.\n\nCredit scoring is closely regulated in the UK, with the industry regulator being the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO). Consumers can also send complaints to the Financial Ombudsman Service if they experience problems with any Credit Reference Agency.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hulland|first=Louise|title=Credit Reference Agencies|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mg74/features/credit-reference-agency|publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nIt is very difficult for a consumer to know in advance whether they have a high enough credit score to be accepted for credit with a given lender.  This situation is due to the complexity and structure of credit scoring, which differs from one lender to another.\n\nLenders need not reveal their credit score head, nor need they reveal the minimum credit score required for the applicant to be accepted, because there may not be such a minimum score.\n\nIf the applicant is declined for credit, the lender is not obliged to reveal the exact reason why. However industry associations including the [[Finance and Leasing Association]] oblige their members to provide a satisfactory reason. Credit-bureau data sharing agreements also require that an applicant declined based on credit-bureau data is told that this is the reason and the address of the credit bureau must be provided.\n\n===United States===\n{{Main|Credit score in the United States}}\nIn the United States, a credit score is a number based on a statistical analysis of a person's credit files, that in theory represents the [[creditworthiness]] of that person, which is the likelihood that people will pay their bills.  A credit score is primarily based on [[credit report]] information, typically from one of the three major [[credit bureau]]s: [[Experian]], [[TransUnion]], and [[Equifax]]. Income and employment history (or lack thereof) are not considered by the major credit bureaus when calculating credit scores.\n\nThere are different methods of calculating credit scores. [[FICO score]]s, the most widely used type of credit score, is a credit score developed by [[FICO]], previously known as [[Fair Isaac|Fair Isaac Corporation]].  As of 2018, there are currently 29 different versions of FICO scores in use in the United States. Some of these versions are \"industry specific\" scores, that is, scores produced for particular market segments, including automotive lending and bankcard (credit card) lending. Industry-specific FICO scores produced for automotive lending are formulated differently than FICO scores produced for bankcard lending. Nearly every consumer will have different FICO scores depending upon which type of FICO score is ordered by a lender; for example, a consumer with several paid-in-full car loans but no reported credit card payment history will generally score better on a FICO automotive-enhanced score than on a FICO bankcard-enhanced score. FICO also produces several \"general purpose\" scores which are not tailored to any particular industry. Industry-specific FICO scores range from 250 to 900, whereas general purpose scores range from 300 to 850.\n\nFICO scores are used by many mortgage lenders that use a risk-based system to determine the possibility that the borrower may default on financial obligations to the mortgage lender. For most mortgages originated in the United States, three credit scores are obtained on a consumer: a Beacon 5.0 score (Beacon is a trademark of FICO) which is calculated from the consumer's Equifax credit history, a FICO Model II score, which is calculated from the consumer's Experian credit history, and a Classic04 score, which is calculated from the consumer's Trans Union history.\n\n[[Credit bureau]]s also often re-sell FICO scores directly to consumers, often a general-purpose FICO 8 score. Previously, the credit bureaus also sold their own credit scores which they developed themselves, and which did not require payment to FICO to utilize: [[Equifax]]'s RISK score and [[Experian]]'s PLUS score. However, as of 2018, these scores are no longer sold by the credit bureaus. Trans Union offers a Vantage 3.0 score for sale to consumers, which is a version of the [[VantageScore]] credit score. In addition, many large lenders, including the major credit card issuers, have developed their own proprietary scoring models.\n\nStudies have shown scores to be predictive of risk in the underwriting of both credit and insurance.<ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/RptCongress/creditscore/creditscore.pdf Report to the Congress on credit scoring and its effects on the availability and affordability of credit]</ref><ref name=insurance>[http://www2.ftc.gov/os/2007/07/P044804FACTA_Report_Credit-Based_Insurance_Scores.pdf Credit-based insurance scores: Impacts on consumers of automobile insurance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511204147/http://ftc.gov/os/2007/07/P044804FACTA_Report_Credit-Based_Insurance_Scores.pdf |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iii.org/media/presentations/creditscoringtexas/|title=No Evidence of Disparate Impact in Texas Due to Use of Credit Information by Personal Lines Insurers - III|author=|date=|website=iii.org}}</ref>  Some studies even suggest that most consumers are the beneficiaries of lower credit costs and insurance premiums due to the use of credit scores.<ref name=insurance/><ref>[http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2003/0203lead.pdf An overview of consumer data and credit reporting]</ref>\n\nNew credit scores have been developed in the last decade by companies such as Scorelogix, [[PRBC (company)|PRBC]], L2C, [[Innovis]] etc. which do not use bureau data to predict creditworthiness. Scorelogix's JSS Credit Score uses a different set of risk factors, such as the borrower's job stability, income, income sufficiency, and impact of economy, in predicting credit risk, and the use of such alternative credit scores is on the rise. These new types of credit scores are often combined with FICO or bureau scores to improve the accuracy of predictions. Most lenders today use some combination of bureau scores and alternative credit scores to develop better understanding of a borrower's ability to pay.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nIt is widely recognized that FICO is a measure of past ability to pay. New credit scores that focus more on future ability to pay are being deployed to enhance credit risk models. L2C offers an alternative credit score that uses utility payment histories to determine creditworthiness, and many lenders use this score in addition to bureau scores to make lending decisions. Many lenders use Scorelogix's JSS score in addition to bureau scores, given that the JSS score incorporates job and income stability to determine whether the borrower will have the ability to repay debt in the future. It is thought that the FICO score will remain the dominant score, but it will likely be used in conjunction with other alternative credit scores that offer other pictures of risk.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nUsage of credit histories in employment screenings has increased from 19% in 1996 to 42% in 2006.<ref name=wernau>{{cite news|last=Wernau|first=Julie|title=TransUnion battling attempts to ban employment credit checks|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-04-28/business/ct-biz-0429-credit-checks-transunion--20100428_1_credit-checks-transunion-credit-bureaus|accessdate=23 October 2011|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=28 April 2010}}</ref>{{rp|1}}  However, credit reports for employment screening purposes do not include credit scores.<ref name=wernau />{{rp|2}}\n\nAmericans are entitled to one free credit report in every 12-month period from each of the three credit bureaus, but are not entitled to receive a free credit score. The three credit bureaus run [[Annualcreditreport.com]], where users can get their free credit reports. Credit scores are available as an add-on feature of the report for a fee. If the consumer disputes an item on a credit report obtained using the free system, under the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]] (FCRA), the credit bureaus have 45 days to investigate, rather than 30 days for reports obtained otherwise.<ref>[http://www.equifax.com/answers/correct-credit-report-errors/en_cp Equifax Credit Report Dispute FAQs] retrieved on 18 December 2008</ref>\n\nAlternatively, consumers wishing to obtain their credit scores can in some cases purchase them separately from the credit bureaus or can purchase their FICO score directly from [[FICO]]. Credit scores (including FICO scores) are also made available free by subscription to one of the many [[credit report monitoring]] services available from the credit bureaus or other third parties, although to actually get the scores free from most such services, one must use a credit card to sign up for a free trial subscription of the service and then cancel before the first monthly charge. Websites like [[WalletHub]], [[Credit Sesame]] and [[Credit Karma]] provide free credit scores with no credit card required, using the [[TransUnion]] VantageScore 3.0 model. Credit.com uses the [[Experian]] VantageScore 3.0 model. Until March 2009, holders of credit cards issued by [[Washington Mutual]] were offered a free FICO score each month through the bank's Web site. ([[Chase (bank)|Chase]], which took over Washington Mutual in 2008, discontinued this practice in March 2009.)<ref>[http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/cc/credit-card-update.asp Chase drops WaMu secured card, FICO score] retrieved on 17 January 2009</ref> [[Chase (bank)|Chase]] resumed the practice of offering a free FICO score in March 2010 of select card members to the exclusion of the majority of former WAMU card holders.\n\nUnder the [[Fair Credit Reporting Act]], a consumer is entitled to a free credit report (but not a free credit score) within 60 days of any adverse action (e.g., being denied credit, or receiving substandard credit terms from a lender) taken as a result of their credit score. Under the [[Wall Street reform]] bill passed on 22 July 2010, a consumer is entitled to receive a free credit score if they are denied a loan or insurance due to their credit score.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/07/15/president-obama-final-passage-wall-street-reform-end-bailouts-a-beginning-accountabi President Obama on Final Passage of Wall Street Reform: An End to Bailouts, a Beginning for Accountability] published 15 July 2010, retrieved on 26 July 2010.</ref>\n\nThe generic or classic FICO credit score ranges between 300 and 850. The VantageScore 3.0 score ranges from 300-850. The old VantageScore was between 501 and 990.\n\nThe first step to interpreting a score is to identify the source of the credit score and its use. There are numerous scores based on various scoring models sold to lenders and other users. The most common was created by FICO and is called FICO score. [[FICO]] is a publicly traded corporation (under the ticker symbol FICO) that created the best-known and most widely used credit score model in the United States. FICO produces scoring models which are installed at and distributed by the three largest national credit repositories in the U.S (TransUnion, Equifax and Experian) and the two national credit repositories in Canada (TransUnion Canada and Equifax Canada).  FICO controls the vast majority of the credit score market in the United States and Canada although there are several other competing players that collectively share a very small percentage of the market.\n\nIn the United States, the [[median]] generic FICO score was 723 in 2006 and 711 in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fico.com/en/blogs/tag/score-distributions/|title=Score Distributions|author=|date=|website=FICO}}</ref>  The performance definition of the FICO risk score (its stated design objective) is to predict the likelihood that a consumer will go 90 days past due or worse in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated.  The higher the consumer's score, the less likely he or she will go 90 days past due in the subsequent 24 months after the score has been calculated.  Because different lending uses (mortgage, automobile, credit card) have different parameters, FICO algorithms are adjusted according to the predictability of that use.  For this reason, a person might have a higher credit score for a revolving credit card debt when compared to a mortgage credit score taken at the same point in time.\n\nThe interpretation of a credit score will vary by lender, industry, and the economy as a whole.  While 640 has been a divider between \"prime\" and \"subprime\", all considerations about score revolve around the strength of the economy in general and investors' appetites for risk in providing the funding for borrowers in particular when the score is evaluated.  In 2010, the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) tightened its guidelines regarding credit scores to a small degree, but lenders who have to service and sell the securities packaged for sale into the secondary market largely raised their minimum score to 640 in the absence of strong compensating factors in the borrower's loan profile.  In another housing example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac began charging extra for loans over 75% of the value that have scores below 740. Furthermore, private mortgage insurance companies will not even provide mortgage insurance for borrowers with scores below 660. Therefore, \"prime\" is a product of the lender's appetite for the risk profile of the borrower at the time that the borrower is asking for the loan.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nSeveral factors affect individual's credit scores. One factor is the amount an individual borrowed as compared to the amount of credit available to the individual. As an individual borrows, or leverages, more money, the individual's credit score decreases.\n\n=== United Arab Emirates ===\nCredit Scores in UAE are issued by AECB, a Federal Government-held company. Individual Credit Scores are three-digit numbers used to predict the likelihood of an individual making their loan and credit card payments on time, based on previous credit and payment behavior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://moneymall.ae/credit-score/|title=Credit Score in UAE|last=|first=|date=|website=moneymall.ae|publisher='MoneyMall' leading personal finance portal in UAE|archive-url=|archive-date=|url-status=|accessdate=22 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Credit Score number in UAE ranges from 300 to 900. A low score indicates a higher risk, whereas a higher score indicates a lower risk.\n\nIssuer of Credit Score is Al Etihad Credit Bureau.  its a Public Joint Stock Company wholly owned by the UAE Federal Government. As per UAE Federal Law No. (6) of 2010 concerning Credit Information, the company is mandated to regularly collect credit information from financial and non-financial institutions in the UAE.\n\nAl Etihad Credit Bureau aggregates and analyzes this data to calculate Credit Scores and produce Credit Reports that are made available to individuals and companies in the UAE.\n\nCredit Scoring is relatively new in UAE, But All major banks started using the same which shows its high importance hence\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Alternative data]]\n* [[Bank statement]]\n* [[Credit bureau]]\n* [[Credit history]]\n* [[Credit reference]]\n* [[Credit repair software]]\n* [[Credit scorecards]]\n* [[Social Credit System]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/pubs/consumer/credit/cre24.shtm|title=FTC Guide to Credit Scores}}\n* {{cite web|title=Credit Scores Video - Federal Trade Commission|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iliZgmqgRRE}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://www.fcac.gc.ca|title=Financial Consumer Agency of Canada}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://money.howstuffworks.com/credit-score.htm|title=How Credit Scores Work}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.clevelandfed.org/en/newsroom-and-events/publications/economic-commentary/economic-commentary-archives/2010-economic-commentaries/ec-201016-your-credit-score-is-a-ranking-not-a-score.aspx|title=Your Credit Score Is a Ranking, Not a Score}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Credit Score}}\n[[Category:Credit scoring| ]]\n[[Category:Personal finance]]\n", "name_user": "Uae Cashl Loans", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eDUBAI)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_score"}

The first part begins in the 1960s with four intellectually arrogant school friends, of whom two feature in the remainder of the story: Tony, the narrator, and Adrian, the most precociously intelligent of the four.  Towards the end of their school days another boy at the school hangs himself, apparently after getting a girl pregnant.  The four friends discuss the philosophical difficulty of knowing exactly what happened.  Adrian goes to [[Cambridge University]] and Tony to [[Bristol University]]. Tony acquires a girlfriend, Veronica, at whose family home he spends an awkward weekend. On waking one morning he finds that he and Veronica's mother, Sarah, are alone in the house, and she apologises for her family's behaviour towards him. Tony and Veronica's relationship fails in some acrimony, as he breaks up with her, and has sex with her after breaking up. In his final year at university Tony receives a letter from Adrian informing him that he is going out with Veronica. Tony replies to the letter, telling Adrian that in his opinion Veronica was damaged in some way and that he should talk to her mother about it. Some months later he is told that Adrian has committed suicide, leaving a note addressed to the [[coroner]] saying that the free person has a philosophical duty to examine the nature of their life, and may then choose to renounce it. Tony admires the reasoning. He briefly recounts the following uneventful forty years of his life until his sixties. \n\nAt this point Tony's narration of the second part of the novel \u2013 which is twice as long as the first \u2013 begins, with the arrival of a lawyer's letter informing him that Veronica's mother has bequeathed him \u00a3500 (which she mysteriously calls \"blood money\") and two documents.<ref name=\"Hass\">{{cite news|url=http://www.the-tls.co.uk/tls/public/article707010.ece|title=Julian Barnes's coming of age|last=Haas|first=Lidija|date=22 August 2011|work=[[Times Literary Supplement]]|publisher=[[News International]]|accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref> These lead him to re-establish contact with Veronica and after a number of meetings with her, to re-evaluate the story he has narrated in the first part.<ref name=\"Sexton\">{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/7112043/the-revised-version.thtmlSexton|title=The Revised Version|last=Sexton|first=David|date=23 July 2011|work=[[The Spectator]]|accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref> On consulting the lawyers, Tony learns that Veronica has Adrian's diary. This leads him to send Veronica repeated e-mails requesting the diary. Veronica eventually sends Tony a single page of the diary, containing Adrian's musings on life as a series of cumulative wagers. Following this, Veronica meets Tony on the [[Millennium Bridge, London|Millennium Bridge in London]] and gives him the letter he sent to Adrian in his youth. On re-reading it, Tony realises how malicious and unpleasant it was, and how he has erased this from his memory. Nevertheless, he persists in attempting to retrieve the diary from Veronica, which leads to her asking him to meet at a location in North London, where she drives him to see a group of mentally handicapped men being taken for a walk by their careworker, one of whom she points out to him. Tony does not understand the significance of this and Veronica leaves him with no explanation. Over the course of several weeks, Tony revisits the location until he is able to relocate the man Veronica showed him in a pub. Tony greets the man saying he is a friend of Veronica's which leads to an upset response from the man. Tony recalls the memory of Adrian from the man's facial features. He e-mails Veronica an apology, saying he didn't realise that she and Adrian had a son together. Veronica only responds with the reply \"You don't get it, but then you never did.\" On revisiting the pub where he saw the man, Tony gets into conversation with the careworker, who reveals that the man is actually the son of Veronica's mother, Sarah, making him Veronica's half-brother. We are left to connect the dots, presuming that Adrian is the father and that the birth of this damaged son may be the reason for his suicide.\n\n==Reception==\n''The Sense of an Ending'' has received mostly positive reviews from critics.

I wrote it that way on purpose, leaving some intentional ambiguity, because I wanted it to lie somewhat between both camps and not entirely in either. I did this because I did not see much stuff being written at that time which fit that description; because I wanted to see whether I could do it; and because I was curious as to how such a book would be received.<ref>\"...And Call Me Roger\"\": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 2, by Christopher S. Kovacs. In: ''The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 2: Power & Light'', NESFA Press, 2009.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Plot summary==\n''Lord of Light'' is set on a planet colonized by some of the remnants of \"vanished Urath\", or Earth. The crew and colonists from the spaceship ''Star of India'' found themselves on a strange planet surrounded by hostile indigenous races and had to carve a place for themselves or perish. To increase their chances of survival, the crew has used chemical treatments, [[biofeedback]] and electronics to mutate their minds and create enhanced self-images, or \"Aspects\", that \"strengthened their bodies and intensified their wills and extended the power of their desires into Attributes, which fell with a force like magic upon those against whom they were turned.\" The crew has also developed a technology to transfer a person's ''atman'', or soul, electronically to a new body. This [[reincarnation]] by [[mind transfer]] has created a race of potential immortals and allowed the former crew members to institute the [[Hindu caste|Hindu caste system]], with themselves at the top.\n\nThe novel covers great spans of time. Eventually, the crew used their now-great powers to subjugate or destroy the native non-human races (whom they characterize as demons) while setting themselves up as gods in the eyes of the many generations of colonist progeny. Taking on the powers and names of [[Hindu deities]], these \"gods\" maintain respect and control of the masses by maintaining a stranglehold on the access to reincarnation and by suppressing any technological advancements beyond a medieval level. The gods fear that any enlightenment or advancement might lead to a technological renaissance that would eventually weaken their power.\n\nThe protagonist, Sam, who has developed the ability to manipulate electromagnetic forces, is a renegade crewman who has rejected godhood, taking for himself the role of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama/Buddha]]. Sam is the last \"Accelerationist\": He believes that technology should be available to the masses, and that reincarnation should not be controlled by the elite. Sam introduces [[Buddhism]] as a [[culture jamming]] tool and strives to cripple the power of the gods with this \"new\" religion. His carefully planned revolt against the gods takes place in stages: \"An army, great in space, may offer opposition in a brief span of time. One man, brief in space, must spread his opposition across a period of many years if he is to have a chance of succeeding.\"\n\n===Stories===\n# In a monastery, the deathgod [[Yama]] \u2013 assisted by Tak, the ape (formerly Tak the Archivist for the gods) and [[Ratri]], Goddess of Night \u2013 assembles a clandestine radio transceiver to extract Sam's ''atman'', or soul, from the \"Bridge of the Gods\", the planet's thick ionosphere, and restore it to a body.  Sam's bodiless essence was projected by the gods into the ionosphere after his capture in the battle of Keenset. This mode of execution was used because the last time the gods killed his body, Sam returned and stole a new one from one of the lesser gods.  When Sam awakes, he claims to be horrified to be back in the flesh, having been aware of his ethereal condition the whole time, and having experienced it as a blissful [[Nirvana]].  He wants to return, to \"hear the song the stars sing on the shores of the great sea.\"  Eventually, after meditation on and immersion in earthly senses, he returns fully to the world.  Shortly after, an encounter with the god Mara, who had come to investigate the disturbances caused by Yama's machinery, causes the conspirators to flee.  As they proceed, Sam muses on his past.\n# Prince Siddhartha, entering old age, comes down to the city of Mahartha to obtain a new body. He finds that there have been political and religious changes while he has lived on his estates. Before getting the body, he must submit to a mind-probe, operated by the ''Masters of Karma'', which will be used to determine his fitness for reincarnation. Those judged unfit are given diseased bodies or even reincarnated as animals such as dogs. The dogs then act as spies for the Masters. Siddhartha contacts Jan Olvegg, former captain of the ''Star of India'', and reveals himself as Sam. He talks via a videoscreen with the current Brahma, and sees that Brahma\u2014who he remembers was originally a woman named Madeleine, incarnated into a male body\u2014cannot stop acting like a God, even seeming to believe it himself when he begins to 'curse' Sam. After this Sam cannot remain passive, and must proceed against the Gods. He raids the House of Karma, steals bodies for himself, Olvegg, and others, and causes the former Chief Master of Karma to be reincarnated as a dog. He then disappears to execute the next stage of his plan.\n# The Buddha appears, preaching a philosophy of non-violence that undermines the doctrine of obedience to the gods and the struggle for a better rebirth. Instead, he emphasizes the pursuit of Nirvana and release from the illusion of the world. The goddess Kali, realizing that this is Sam's work, sends her personal executioner, Rild, to kill Sam, but Rild falls ill and is found and tended to by the Buddhist acolytes, as well as by Sam himself. Because he owes Sam his life, Rild renounces his mission after he recovers. He becomes one of Sam's disciples, eventually exceeding his teacher's wisdom. He takes the name Sugata, preaching in earnest what Sam had done only calculatingly as a way to overthrow the gods. Yama descends to kill Sam. Sugata/Rild faces Yama on a treetrunk bridge over a river, knowing he cannot defeat the God of Death, but fighting him anyway. Yama kills Rild and proceeds to find Sam. However, Sam tricks Yama and escapes, promising to return with \"new weapons\". Sam also warns Yama against the machinations of Yama's beloved Kali, and in so doing makes a personal enemy of Yama.\n# Sam enters Hellwell, a huge pit where he had bound the demons centuries earlier. He negotiates with their leader, Taraka, for allies in his struggle. He frees Taraka to see the world above, but Taraka betrays him by taking possession of Sam's body, promising to resume the bargain \"later\". While in control of Sam's body, Taraka deposes a local [[maharajah]] and takes over his palace and harem. As Sam recovers control of his body, he finds himself becoming more like Taraka, enjoying the pleasures of the flesh. In turn, Taraka takes on some aspects of Sam, and ceases to revel in his life of pleasure. Sam tells him he has suffered the ''Curse of the Buddha'', which is revealed to be a conscience and guilt. Soon after, [[Agni]], God of Fire, arrives to kill Sam, finding instead two spirits in one body. Agni destroys the palace, while Sam/Taraka flees to Hellwell. They decide to free as many demons as possible before the gods arrive. However, even the full might of all the demons of Hellwell cannot stand against the gods. A mere four of the gods, Yama, [[Kali]], [[Shiva]], and Agni, are able to hold off the demons and pursue Sam. Despite his own powers, Sam is captured and Taraka leaves him. Sam is told that he is to be taken to Heaven and made an example of, lest the other gods try to emulate his rebellion.\n# In the place called Heaven, Yama and Kali are to be married. Tak of the Bright Spear is the Archivist of Heaven, but is suspect because he was fathered in lifetimes past by Sam. However, Tak's main concern is seducing comely demi-goddesses such as [[Maya, the Mistress of Illusion|Maya (illusion)]]. Sam is more or less free to wander Heaven, even trysting with Kali, who would like to have him back as her lover. He preaches to any who will listen, and the gods allow this, hoping to flush out sympathizers. However, Sam knows of some of his old gadgetry locked away in one of the museums in Heaven, and with the help of Helba, the Goddess of Thieves, he attempts an escape using a belt that amplifies his powers. This fails, and Kali, disgusted with herself and with him, persuades Brahma to order a human sacrifice, namely Helba and Sam himself, to celebrate her wedding. Sam is set free once more to flee for his life, hunted by the White Tigers of Kaniburrha, some of whom may be reincarnated gods, perhaps even Kali herself. Tak attempts to protect Sam by killing the tigers, but is struck down by [[Ganesha]]. For this, Tak is sent out of Heaven in the body of an ape. The wedding proceeds, with Sam apparently dead.\n# Brahma is dead. He has been murdered by persons or gods unknown. Vishnu, Shiva, and Ganesha gather to quickly arrange a replacement. They decide that the only viable candidate is Kali. However, for her to be reincarnated as Brahma (a man), her short marriage to Yama must end. Yama is appalled at how coldly she accepts this. Next, Shiva is found murdered. Yama throws himself into investigating the deaths. His friend, [[Kubera]], approaches the demigod [[Kartikeya|Murugan]] and accuses him of the murders, finally addressing him as Sam. Taraka, Lord of the Rakshasa, had taken a liking to Sam and 'strengthened his flames' so he could exist as pure energy, and can survive without a body. He displaced Murugan's spirit as Murugan was about to occupy a new body for the wedding feast. Kubera uncovered the deception by examining the brainwave records from the transfer. Instead of turning Sam in, Kubera offers to help him escape. Sam refuses, determined to kill as many gods as he can. Since Kubera's friend, Yama, is the obvious next target, Kubera tricks Sam, who underestimates Kubera's physical strength and the powers of his Attribute, and in a bout of [[Bare-knuckle boxing#Irish stand down|Irish Stand-Down]] (in which two men take turns hitting each other until one cannot continue), knocks him out and prepares to flee on the giant bird [[Garuda]]. They recruit Ratri to stop Yama from interfering, and take her along. They flee to the city of Keenset, which is undergoing a technological revival, and is marked for destruction by the gods. Eventually, Yama, feeling betrayed by Kali and the other gods, joins them. With Yama's weaponry, and various allies, including the zombie army of Nirriti the Black, they fight a titanic battle of gods, men, and monsters, killing thousands of men, demigods, and eventually some gods as well. They go down in defeat, but not before dealing a crushing blow to the hierarchy of heaven. Yama apparently commits suicide, but some suspect that he has invented a remote reincarnation device. Ratri is exiled from heaven and condemned to wander the world in a series of homely bodies. Kubera had hidden himself in a vault, held in suspended animation. Sam, having proved himself unkillable, is instead projected into the magnetized debris ring around the planet, known as the Bridge of the Gods. However, the gods win only a [[pyrrhic victory]]. The most powerful deities, such as Yama, Brahma, Shiva, and Agni, are now dead or sworn enemies of Heaven. Others have gone into exile rather than fight against Sam. While Brahma/Kali is exultant, Ganesha realizes that the days of Heaven are numbered, and he must look out for himself.\n# In the final story, Sam has been returned from Nirvana. Sam, together with Yama, Ratri, and Kubera, plan their next move in their campaign against heaven. They are joined by the drunken god [[Krishna]], who is a great fighter when sober, and who has wandered the world since he went into exile rather than fight at Keenset. Meanwhile, Nirriti, a Christian and the former chaplain of the original ship, has amassed great power in the southern continent. He is laying waste to cities in his attempts to stamp out the Hindu religion that he hates. He has acquired enough technology to challenge anything the gods can muster, even if they resort to \"the tall man of smoke who wears a wide hat,\" apparently a reference to a nuclear device. He is also allied with the freed demons. At first he seems to be a natural ally for Sam and Yama, but they entrust the demon Taraka with conveying a message to him, and Taraka is determined to fight Yama, to prove that Taraka is the mightiest being on the planet. Thus Taraka falsely tells them that Nirriti has refused, and instead they ally with Brahma to defeat Nirriti, if Brahma will consent to their demands. This alliance defeats Nirriti in a final battle, despite Ganesha's attempt at betrayal, but at a huge cost. Brahma (the former Kali), fatally wounded, is conveyed from the battlefield by Yama. Later, Kubera finds Yama with his \"daughter\", whom he calls \"Murga\". She is mentally disabled, and Yama admits that this was due to a botched mind-transfer. Kubera, always ready to help his friend, uses his powers to stimulate Murga's mind. Sam sees Tak restored to a young body, as is Ratri. Sam then leaves, no one is sure where to; sometime later, Yama follows. Myths build up around their life and departure.\n\n==Characters==\nThe novel has a range of major and minor characters, each with a backstory which, in some cases, is deliberately vague with the intent of intensifying a sense of mystery.\n\nThe gods live in Heaven, an artificial plateau in the polar regions \"where only the mighty might make their home.\" It is covered by a giant dome for defense and weather control. Heaven is divided into the Celestial City and the Forest of Kaniburrha.\n\n===Major characters===\n* Sam is one of the crew of the ''Star of India'', the starship which brought the colonists to the planet. He thus belongs to the group who are known as the First, a diminishing group of people. As Sam says, \"All the rest are dead, or are gods\". He himself had been a god, styling himself [[Kalki]]n. Thanks to his several lives and exploits, he is known by many names, such as ''[[Maitreya]], Lord of Light, [[Manjusri]] of the Sword, Binder of Demons'' and so on. His major contribution to the ascendancy of the Gods was his use of what he termed electrodirection, or mental control of electromagnetics, to control and destroy or bind the worst natives of the planet, who were beings of pure energy known to men as demons. The power can also interfere with electronics and machinery, and, if strengthened, alter gravitation. Eventually disillusioned by the rise of the Gods, he retires to the life of Prince Siddhartha, until he finally rebels. In doing so, he creates more legends, and gains more names, including ''[[Buddhahood|Buddha]], The Enlightened One, [[Tathagatha]], Mahasamatman or Great-Souled Sam'' etc. After an episode of 'demonic possession' by one of the planet's original inhabitants, his 'mind' can exist outside his body, even if his body is killed.\n{{anchor|Yama}}\n* [[Yama]], the God of Death, begins as Sam's enemy, but later becomes his chief ally. He is a third generation colonist with an unusual history. A juvenile scientific genius, he was mortally injured in an accidental explosion, so that he had to be quickly reincarnated into the first available body, which happened to be a middle-aged male. He therefore was \"old before he was young\", and did not have the same outlook as someone who has \"known first love in the days of spring\". He is a \"master of arms, master of sciences\", who has created much of the new technology behind the power of the Gods' regime, while himself being a peerless combatant with both medieval and technologically advanced weaponry. He also has the power of the ''death gaze'', which allows him to kill by looking his victim in the eyes. Asked by Sam how he can bear to serve a \"bunch of drunken body changers\" he puts forth a \"higher cause\" rationale. However he also is emotionally involved with Kali, and eventually revolts as a result of her betrayal. Ganesha assesses him as \"too serious, too conscientious\", and \"emotionally unstable\".\n* [[Kali]], Goddess of Destruction, also known as ''Durga'', consort of Kalkin, and once called ''Candi the Fierce'', is another of the ''First''. Over the centuries, she has been Sam's lover, companion, wife, comrade-in-arms, and finally enemy. She yearns for the days when the planet was still wild and unconquered. As Sam warns Yama, who loves her, she loves only \"those who bring her gifts of chaos\". Like Yama, she has the death-gaze power, along with many others only hinted at. She also carries a weapon, the skull-wheel, which is some kind of ultrasonic emitter that causes confusion and oblivion, even to the demons.\n* Tak, of the Bright Spear, is a former demigod exiled to the world as an ape, as punishment for trying to help Sam while he was in captivity. He is also Sam's son, possibly of Sam's original body, a fact of which Sam may not be aware. Tak is very philosophical and practical, once rationalizing that when people have many bodies, biological parenthood becomes meaningless. However, he seemingly helps Sam exactly because of that connection between them.\n* [[Kubera]] is Yama's friend and companion in an order of the Gods called the ''[[Lokapala]]s''. He's a man who loves his food and drink; no matter how he is reincarnated, his body always runs to fat. He is however, shrewdly intelligent and a master technologist, surpassing Yama in some areas. He's known as steadfastedly loyal, and has never broken his word once he's given it. He has the unique ability to invest inanimate objects with emotion and feelings, which he uses to create the ''Pavilion of Silence at Worldsend'', a structure at the far end of the place known as Heaven in which rooms are dedicated to emotions such as Despair, Heartbreak, and Fear. This is a place of retreat for the Gods. After centuries of idleness as a God he eventually breaks with the rest and helps Sam.\n* [[Ratri]], Goddess of the Night is Kubera's friend who is drawn into the conflict, not altogether unwillingly. She too is disgusted by the treatment Sam received in Heaven, and goes to Kubera for advice after she witnesses Brahma's last twitches when he is poisoned. Eventually she helps Kubera escape Heaven with Sam. Her power is to cast Night\u2014enforced darkness\u2014across any area, which is used in the Battle of Keenset. After that battle, because she is judged to have been merely weak-willed in helping Sam, she is expelled from Heaven to wander the world in bodies that can not express her powers, or her beauty. In spite of this she can occasionally summon the strength to become the Goddess whose ''\"radiance drives out the dark\"''. In character terms she provides an emotional counterweight to Yama's hatred and Sam's zeal.\n\n===Minor characters===\n* Jan Olvegg, also known as ''Olvagga'', or ''Janaveg'', or ''Janagga'', is another one of the ''First''. In fact, he was the Captain of the colonists' ship. Sam encounters him in exile while still contemplating his own rebellion. He identifies himself to Olvegg with \"It's a long way to Tipperary\". Olvegg, who at first cannot recognize Sam because of his changing of bodies, brings Sam up to date on the rise of the Gods since Sam retired, and thus precipitates Sam's campaign. He is later captured by, and agrees to fight for, Nirriti the Black.  Nirriti remembers that Olvegg was a Christian, although far less fanatical than Nirriti in spreading his faith.\n* Rild, later called ''Sugata'', is introduced as an assassin and master swordsman, a holy disciple of Kali. He is sent to kill Sam while Sam is reviving Buddhism by playing the Buddha, but instead becomes a convert to Buddhist philosophy and eventually attains true enlightenment. This has some similarities to the tale of [[Angulimala]].\n* [[Trimurti]], composed of [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], rule in Heaven. However, Brahma is weak-spirited, mostly concerned with his manliness, since he was originally a woman named Madeleine. Shiva is an \"old warhorse\" whose main power is a trident made by Yama, which can kill or disintegrate. Shiva also uses the \"Thunder Chariot\" a jet-powered aircraft. Vishnu, the Preserver, was the architect of the place called Heaven, but is a passive god who goes along with Brahma's machinations, which in turn seem to be driven by the influence of Kali and Ganesha.\n* [[Ganesha]] is a manipulator, an insider, the self-styled power behind the throne. He pushes the other Gods to consolidate their power, even to the extent of persuading them to allow Sam to preach while held captive in Heaven, hoping to tempt sympathizers into revealing themselves. As the power of the Gods wanes, he tries to maintain his position by betraying them to Nirriti. Asked if he trusts Ganesha, Nirriti replies \"Yes, but I would give him his silver afterward\", a clear reference to [[Judas Iscariot]], Nirriti being a Christian. He dies in the final battle.\n* [[Agni]], God of Fire, is a fearsome character armed with a wand that emits the ''Universal Fire'', a stream of plasma which destroys anything it touches. He and Yama were friends prior to Yama joining Sam. The wand itself can only be held by wearing a special outfit and glove, presumably to protect the holder. He also has goggles that enable him to see in infra-red and ultra-violet radiation, and for immense distances. It is said he scarred the faces of the moons with his wand, while standing on the ground. The original Agni replaces Shiva after the latter was killed by Sam, and was replaced himself by subsequent 'lesser' Agnis who died one after another.\n* [[Tarakasur|Taraka]], Lord of the [[Rakshasa (fiction)|Rakshasa]], is a demon, an energy being. Like the rest of his kind he was bound by Sam in the early days, but is set free by Sam as part of a bargain to marshal the demons to oppose the gods. Taraka deceives Sam and possesses his body after his release, resulting in Sam and Taraka simultaneously living in Sam's body. The cohabitation leads them to each gain some of the traits of the other, but the effect is more pronounced upon Taraka, as he learns to feel sorrow, remorse, and guilt. Eventually, out of respect and as a sort of recompense, Taraka 'strengthens the flames' of Sam's soul, enabling him to live as an energy being like the Rakshasa do, if he should be killed. Taraka is killed by Yama's death gaze in the final battle, despite Sam's warnings.\n* [[Nirriti]] the Black was originally Renfrew, the chaplain of the colonists' ship. A staunch Christian, he is disgusted by the ascendancy of Hinduism on the planet and eventually sets himself up with an army of zombie soldiers to conquer and convert the planet. (Nirriti is portrayed as a solo megalomaniac, opposed to the pantheon of the Gods.) This character is deeply ironic, a Christian who comes to be known as \"The Dark Lord\", leader of an army of \"Soulless Ones\" who have no will of their own but kneel to accompany him in his prayers when so ordered. His final irony is to die in the arms of the false Buddha, Sam. As he dies, he asks for Sam's blessing, which is freely given.\n* [[Mara (demon)|Mara]], Lord of Illusion, can project complex illusions across great distances, a power that the Gods use both for entertainment and in battle. He is the one God who can stand against Sam and Yama at Keenset where both exert their full powers, being able to misdirect their attacks. Likewise he frustrates Sam's attempt to escape Heaven by confusing him as to the way out of the dome. Despite this his character is not much in evidence in the novel, only his actions. In the first story he appears in disguise attempting to find out what Yama is doing, but when confronted, apparently unable to use his powers of illusion effectively against Yama within a limited space, the Death God breaks his neck, thus killing him.\n* [[Krishna]] is seen only briefly, and as two different characters. He is characterized as a lord of music and dance, and he wields a power of divine drunkenness. He has enormous charisma. Krishna is mostly an apolitical libertine, but was said to be a deadly wrestler who \"broke the black demon [[Banasura|Bana]]\" during the battles between the colonists and the native inhabitants of the planet, which suggests that he was one of the First. Eventually, disgusted by the abusive practices of the Gods, he joins Sam's efforts to overthrow them. A 'false Krishna' also is mentioned, as when the original Krishna went missing a replacement was found.\n* [[Murugan]], who when introduced is a god of youth in an older body and is patiently awaiting a new body during the wedding of Yama and Kali.  He meets the real death when his new body is stolen by Sam during the reincarnation process.\n\n==Film version==\nIn 1979 it was announced that ''Lord of Light'' would be made into a 50 million dollar film. It was planned that the sets for the movie would be made permanent and become the core of a [[science fiction]] [[theme park]] to be built in [[Aurora, Colorado]].

I wrote it that way on purpose, leaving some intentional ambiguity, because I wanted it to lie somewhat between both camps and not entirely in either. I did this because I did not see much stuff being written at that time which fit that description; because I wanted to see whether I could do it; and because I was curious as to how such a book would be received.<ref>\"...And Call Me Roger\"\": The Literary Life of Roger Zelazny, Part 2, by Christopher S. Kovacs. In: ''The Collected Stories of Roger Zelazny, Volume 2: Power & Light'', NESFA Press, 2009.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Plot summary==\n''Lord of Light'' is set on a planet colonized by some of the remnants of \"vanished Urath\", or Earth. The crew and colonists from the spaceship ''Star of India'' found themselves on a strange planet surrounded by hostile indigenous races and had to carve a place for themselves or perish. To increase their chances of survival, the crew has used chemical treatments, [[biofeedback]] and electronics to mutate their minds and create enhanced self-images, or \"Aspects\", that \"strengthened their bodies and intensified their wills and extended the power of their desires into Attributes, which fell with a force like magic upon those against whom they were turned.\" The crew has also developed a technology to transfer a person's ''atman'', or soul, electronically to a new body. This [[reincarnation]] by [[mind transfer]] has created a race of potential immortals and allowed the former crew members to institute the [[Hindu caste|Hindu caste system]], with themselves at the top.\n\nThe novel covers great spans of time. Eventually, the crew used their now-great powers to subjugate or destroy the native non-human races (whom they characterize as demons) while setting themselves up as gods in the eyes of the many generations of colonist progeny. Taking on the powers and names of [[Hindu deities]], these \"gods\" maintain respect and control of the masses by maintaining a stranglehold on the access to reincarnation and by suppressing any technological advancements beyond a medieval level. The gods fear that any enlightenment or advancement might lead to a technological renaissance that would eventually weaken their power.\n\nThe protagonist, Sam, who has developed the ability to manipulate electromagnetic forces, is a renegade crewman who has rejected godhood, taking for himself the role of [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama/Buddha]]. Sam is the last \"Accelerationist\": He believes that technology should be available to the masses, and that reincarnation should not be controlled by the elite. Sam introduces [[Buddhism]] as a [[culture jamming]] tool and strives to cripple the power of the gods with this \"new\" religion. His carefully planned revolt against the gods takes place in stages: \"An army, great in space, may offer opposition in a brief span of time. One man, brief in space, must spread his opposition across a period of many years if he is to have a chance of succeeding.\"\n\n===Stories===\n# In a monastery, the deathgod [[Yama]] \u2013 assisted by Tak, the ape (formerly Tak the Archivist for the gods) and [[Ratri]], Goddess of Night \u2013 assembles a clandestine radio transceiver to extract Sam's ''atman'', or soul, from the \"Bridge of the Gods\", the planet's thick ionosphere, and restore it to a body.  Sam's bodiless essence was projected by the gods into the ionosphere after his capture in the battle of Keenset. This mode of execution was used because the last time the gods killed his body, Sam returned and stole a new one from one of the lesser gods.  When Sam awakes, he claims to be horrified to be back in the flesh, having been aware of his ethereal condition the whole time, and having experienced it as a blissful [[Nirvana]].  He wants to return, to \"hear the song the stars sing on the shores of the great sea.\"  Eventually, after meditation on and immersion in earthly senses, he returns fully to the world.  Shortly after, an encounter with the god Mara, who had come to investigate the disturbances caused by Yama's machinery, causes the conspirators to flee.  As they proceed, Sam muses on his past \n# Prince Siddhartha, entering old age, comes down to the city of Mahartha to obtain a new body. He finds that there have been political and religious changes while he has lived on his estates. Before getting the body, he must submit to a mind-probe, operated by the ''Masters of Karma'', which will be used to determine his fitness for reincarnation. Those judged unfit are given diseased bodies or even reincarnated as animals such as dogs. The dogs then act as spies for the Masters. Siddhartha contacts Jan Olvegg, former captain of the ''Star of India'', and reveals himself as Sam. He talks via a videoscreen with the current Brahma, and sees that Brahma\u2014who he remembers was originally a woman named Madeleine, incarnated into a male body\u2014cannot stop acting like a God, even seeming to believe it himself when he begins to 'curse' Sam. After this Sam cannot remain passive, and must proceed against the Gods. He raids the House of Karma, steals bodies for himself, Olvegg, and others, and causes the former Chief Master of Karma to be reincarnated as a dog. He then disappears to execute the next stage of his plan.\n# The Buddha appears, preaching a philosophy of non-violence that undermines the doctrine of obedience to the gods and the struggle for a better rebirth. Instead, he emphasizes the pursuit of Nirvana and release from the illusion of the world. The goddess Kali, realizing that this is Sam's work, sends her personal executioner, Rild, to kill Sam, but Rild falls ill and is found and tended to by the Buddhist acolytes, as well as by Sam himself. Because he owes Sam his life, Rild renounces his mission after he recovers. He becomes one of Sam's disciples, eventually exceeding his teacher's wisdom. He takes the name Sugata, preaching in earnest what Sam had done only calculatingly as a way to overthrow the gods. Yama descends to kill Sam. Sugata/Rild faces Yama on a treetrunk bridge over a river, knowing he cannot defeat the God of Death, but fighting him anyway. Yama kills Rild and proceeds to find Sam. However, Sam tricks Yama and escapes, promising to return with \"new weapons\". Sam also warns Yama against the machinations of Yama's beloved Kali, and in so doing makes a personal enemy of Yama.\n# Sam enters Hellwell, a huge pit where he had bound the demons centuries earlier. He negotiates with their leader, Taraka, for allies in his struggle. He frees Taraka to see the world above, but Taraka betrays him by taking possession of Sam's body, promising to resume the bargain \"later\". While in control of Sam's body, Taraka deposes a local [[maharajah]] and takes over his palace and harem. As Sam recovers control of his body, he finds himself becoming more like Taraka, enjoying the pleasures of the flesh. In turn, Taraka takes on some aspects of Sam, and ceases to revel in his life of pleasure. Sam tells him he has suffered the ''Curse of the Buddha'', which is revealed to be a conscience and guilt. Soon after, [[Agni]], God of Fire, arrives to kill Sam, finding instead two spirits in one body. Agni destroys the palace, while Sam/Taraka flees to Hellwell. They decide to free as many demons as possible before the gods arrive. However, even the full might of all the demons of Hellwell cannot stand against the gods. A mere four of the gods, Yama, [[Kali]], [[Shiva]], and Agni, are able to hold off the demons and pursue Sam. Despite his own powers, Sam is captured and Taraka leaves him. Sam is told that he is to be taken to Heaven and made an example of, lest the other gods try to emulate his rebellion.\n# In the place called Heaven, Yama and Kali are to be married. Tak of the Bright Spear is the Archivist of Heaven, but is suspect because he was fathered in lifetimes past by Sam. However, Tak's main concern is seducing comely demi-goddesses such as [[Maya, the Mistress of Illusion|Maya (illusion)]]. Sam is more or less free to wander Heaven, even trysting with Kali, who would like to have him back as her lover. He preaches to any who will listen, and the gods allow this, hoping to flush out sympathizers. However, Sam knows of some of his old gadgetry locked away in one of the museums in Heaven, and with the help of Helba, the Goddess of Thieves, he attempts an escape using a belt that amplifies his powers. This fails, and Kali, disgusted with herself and with him, persuades Brahma to order a human sacrifice, namely Helba and Sam himself, to celebrate her wedding. Sam is set free once more to flee for his life, hunted by the White Tigers of Kaniburrha, some of whom may be reincarnated gods, perhaps even Kali herself. Tak attempts to protect Sam by killing the tigers, but is struck down by [[Ganesha]]. For this, Tak is sent out of Heaven in the body of an ape. The wedding proceeds, with Sam apparently dead.\n# Brahma is dead. He has been murdered by persons or gods unknown. Vishnu, Shiva, and Ganesha gather to quickly arrange a replacement. They decide that the only viable candidate is Kali. However, for her to be reincarnated as Brahma (a man), her short marriage to Yama must end. Yama is appalled at how coldly she accepts this. Next, Shiva is found murdered. Yama throws himself into investigating the deaths. His friend, [[Kubera]], approaches the demigod [[Kartikeya|Murugan]] and accuses him of the murders, finally addressing him as Sam. Taraka, Lord of the Rakshasa, had taken a liking to Sam and 'strengthened his flames' so he could exist as pure energy, and can survive without a body. He displaced Murugan's spirit as Murugan was about to occupy a new body for the wedding feast. Kubera uncovered the deception by examining the brainwave records from the transfer. Instead of turning Sam in, Kubera offers to help him escape. Sam refuses, determined to kill as many gods as he can. Since Kubera's friend, Yama, is the obvious next target, Kubera tricks Sam, who underestimates Kubera's physical strength and the powers of his Attribute, and in a bout of [[Bare-knuckle boxing#Irish stand down|Irish Stand-Down]] (in which two men take turns hitting each other until one cannot continue), knocks him out and prepares to flee on the giant bird [[Garuda]]. They recruit Ratri to stop Yama from interfering, and take her along. They flee to the city of Keenset, which is undergoing a technological revival, and is marked for destruction by the gods. Eventually, Yama, feeling betrayed by Kali and the other gods, joins them. With Yama's weaponry, and various allies, including the zombie army of Nirriti the Black, they fight a titanic battle of gods, men, and monsters, killing thousands of men, demigods, and eventually some gods as well. They go down in defeat, but not before dealing a crushing blow to the hierarchy of heaven. Yama apparently commits suicide, but some suspect that he has invented a remote reincarnation device. Ratri is exiled from heaven and condemned to wander the world in a series of homely bodies. Kubera had hidden himself in a vault, held in suspended animation. Sam, having proved himself unkillable, is instead projected into the magnetized debris ring around the planet, known as the Bridge of the Gods. However, the gods win only a [[pyrrhic victory]]. The most powerful deities, such as Yama, Brahma, Shiva, and Agni, are now dead or sworn enemies of Heaven. Others have gone into exile rather than fight against Sam. While Brahma/Kali is exultant, Ganesha realizes that the days of Heaven are numbered, and he must look out for himself.\n# In the final story, Sam has been returned from Nirvana. Sam, together with Yama, Ratri, and Kubera, plan their next move in their campaign against heaven. They are joined by the drunken god [[Krishna]], who is a great fighter when sober, and who has wandered the world since he went into exile rather than fight at Keenset. Meanwhile, Nirriti, a Christian and the former chaplain of the original ship, has amassed great power in the southern continent. He is laying waste to cities in his attempts to stamp out the Hindu religion that he hates. He has acquired enough technology to challenge anything the gods can muster, even if they resort to \"the tall man of smoke who wears a wide hat,\" apparently a reference to a nuclear device. He is also allied with the freed demons. At first he seems to be a natural ally for Sam and Yama, but they entrust the demon Taraka with conveying a message to him, and Taraka is determined to fight Yama, to prove that Taraka is the mightiest being on the planet. Thus Taraka falsely tells them that Nirriti has refused, and instead they ally with Brahma to defeat Nirriti, if Brahma will consent to their demands. This alliance defeats Nirriti in a final battle, despite Ganesha's attempt at betrayal, but at a huge cost. Brahma (the former Kali), fatally wounded, is conveyed from the battlefield by Yama. Later, Kubera finds Yama with his \"daughter\", whom he calls \"Murga\". She is mentally disabled, and Yama admits that this was due to a botched mind-transfer. Kubera, always ready to help his friend, uses his powers to stimulate Murga's mind. Sam sees Tak restored to a young body, as is Ratri. Sam then leaves, no one is sure where to; sometime later, Yama follows. Myths build up around their life and departure.\n\n==Characters==\nThe novel has a range of major and minor characters, each with a backstory which, in some cases, is deliberately vague with the intent of intensifying a sense of mystery.\n\nThe gods live in Heaven, an artificial plateau in the polar regions \"where only the mighty might make their home.\" It is covered by a giant dome for defense and weather control. Heaven is divided into the Celestial City and the Forest of Kaniburrha.\n\n===Major characters===\n* Sam is one of the crew of the ''Star of India'', the starship which brought the colonists to the planet. He thus belongs to the group who are known as the First, a diminishing group of people. As Sam says, \"All the rest are dead, or are gods\". He himself had been a god, styling himself [[Kalki]]n. Thanks to his several lives and exploits, he is known by many names, such as ''[[Maitreya]], Lord of Light, [[Manjusri]] of the Sword, Binder of Demons'' and so on. His major contribution to the ascendancy of the Gods was his use of what he termed electrodirection, or mental control of electromagnetics, to control and destroy or bind the worst natives of the planet, who were beings of pure energy known to men as demons. The power can also interfere with electronics and machinery, and, if strengthened, alter gravitation. Eventually disillusioned by the rise of the Gods, he retires to the life of Prince Siddhartha, until he finally rebels. In doing so, he creates more legends, and gains more names, including ''[[Buddhahood|Buddha]], The Enlightened One, [[Tathagatha]], Mahasamatman or Great-Souled Sam'' etc. After an episode of 'demonic possession' by one of the planet's original inhabitants, his 'mind' can exist outside his body, even if his body is killed.\n{{anchor|Yama}}\n* [[Yama]], the God of Death, begins as Sam's enemy, but later becomes his chief ally. He is a third generation colonist with an unusual history. A juvenile scientific genius, he was mortally injured in an accidental explosion, so that he had to be quickly reincarnated into the first available body, which happened to be a middle-aged male. He therefore was \"old before he was young\", and did not have the same outlook as someone who has \"known first love in the days of spring\". He is a \"master of arms, master of sciences\", who has created much of the new technology behind the power of the Gods' regime, while himself being a peerless combatant with both medieval and technologically advanced weaponry. He also has the power of the ''death gaze'', which allows him to kill by looking his victim in the eyes. Asked by Sam how he can bear to serve a \"bunch of drunken body changers\" he puts forth a \"higher cause\" rationale. However he also is emotionally involved with Kali, and eventually revolts as a result of her betrayal. Ganesha assesses him as \"too serious, too conscientious\", and \"emotionally unstable\".\n* [[Kali]], Goddess of Destruction, also known as ''Durga'', consort of Kalkin, and once called ''Candi the Fierce'', is another of the ''First''. Over the centuries, she has been Sam's lover, companion, wife, comrade-in-arms, and finally enemy. She yearns for the days when the planet was still wild and unconquered. As Sam warns Yama, who loves her, she loves only \"those who bring her gifts of chaos\". Like Yama, she has the death-gaze power, along with many others only hinted at. She also carries a weapon, the skull-wheel, which is some kind of ultrasonic emitter that causes confusion and oblivion, even to the demons.\n* Tak, of the Bright Spear, is a former demigod exiled to the world as an ape, as punishment for trying to help Sam while he was in captivity. He is also Sam's son, possibly of Sam's original body, a fact of which Sam may not be aware. Tak is very philosophical and practical, once rationalizing that when people have many bodies, biological parenthood becomes meaningless. However, he seemingly helps Sam exactly because of that connection between them.\n* [[Kubera]] is Yama's friend and companion in an order of the Gods called the ''[[Lokapala]]s''. He's a man who loves his food and drink; no matter how he is reincarnated, his body always runs to fat. He is however, shrewdly intelligent and a master technologist, surpassing Yama in some areas. He's known as steadfastedly loyal, and has never broken his word once he's given it. He has the unique ability to invest inanimate objects with emotion and feelings, which he uses to create the ''Pavilion of Silence at Worldsend'', a structure at the far end of the place known as Heaven in which rooms are dedicated to emotions such as Despair, Heartbreak, and Fear. This is a place of retreat for the Gods. After centuries of idleness as a God he eventually breaks with the rest and helps Sam.\n* [[Ratri]], Goddess of the Night is Kubera's friend who is drawn into the conflict, not altogether unwillingly. She too is disgusted by the treatment Sam received in Heaven, and goes to Kubera for advice after she witnesses Brahma's last twitches when he is poisoned. Eventually she helps Kubera escape Heaven with Sam. Her power is to cast Night\u2014enforced darkness\u2014across any area, which is used in the Battle of Keenset. After that battle, because she is judged to have been merely weak-willed in helping Sam, she is expelled from Heaven to wander the world in bodies that can not express her powers, or her beauty. In spite of this she can occasionally summon the strength to become the Goddess whose ''\"radiance drives out the dark\"''. In character terms she provides an emotional counterweight to Yama's hatred and Sam's zeal.\n\n===Minor characters===\n* Jan Olvegg, also known as ''Olvagga'', or ''Janaveg'', or ''Janagga'', is another one of the ''First''. In fact, he was the Captain of the colonists' ship. Sam encounters him in exile while still contemplating his own rebellion. He identifies himself to Olvegg with \"It's a long way to Tipperary\". Olvegg, who at first cannot recognize Sam because of his changing of bodies, brings Sam up to date on the rise of the Gods since Sam retired, and thus precipitates Sam's campaign. He is later captured by, and agrees to fight for, Nirriti the Black.  Nirriti remembers that Olvegg was a Christian, although far less fanatical than Nirriti in spreading his faith.\n* Rild, later called ''Sugata'', is introduced as an assassin and master swordsman, a holy disciple of Kali. He is sent to kill Sam while Sam is reviving Buddhism by playing the Buddha, but instead becomes a convert to Buddhist philosophy and eventually attains true enlightenment. This has some similarities to the tale of [[Angulimala]].\n* [[Trimurti]], composed of [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], rule in Heaven. However, Brahma is weak-spirited, mostly concerned with his manliness, since he was originally a woman named Madeleine. Shiva is an \"old warhorse\" whose main power is a trident made by Yama, which can kill or disintegrate. Shiva also uses the \"Thunder Chariot\" a jet-powered aircraft. Vishnu, the Preserver, was the architect of the place called Heaven, but is a passive god who goes along with Brahma's machinations, which in turn seem to be driven by the influence of Kali and Ganesha.\n* [[Ganesha]] is a manipulator, an insider, the self-styled power behind the throne. He pushes the other Gods to consolidate their power, even to the extent of persuading them to allow Sam to preach while held captive in Heaven, hoping to tempt sympathizers into revealing themselves. As the power of the Gods wanes, he tries to maintain his position by betraying them to Nirriti. Asked if he trusts Ganesha, Nirriti replies \"Yes, but I would give him his silver afterward\", a clear reference to [[Judas Iscariot]], Nirriti being a Christian. He dies in the final battle.\n* [[Agni]], God of Fire, is a fearsome character armed with a wand that emits the ''Universal Fire'', a stream of plasma which destroys anything it touches. He and Yama were friends prior to Yama joining Sam. The wand itself can only be held by wearing a special outfit and glove, presumably to protect the holder. He also has goggles that enable him to see in infra-red and ultra-violet radiation, and for immense distances. It is said he scarred the faces of the moons with his wand, while standing on the ground. The original Agni replaces Shiva after the latter was killed by Sam, and was replaced himself by subsequent 'lesser' Agnis who died one after another.\n* [[Tarakasur|Taraka]], Lord of the [[Rakshasa (fiction)|Rakshasa]], is a demon, an energy being. Like the rest of his kind he was bound by Sam in the early days, but is set free by Sam as part of a bargain to marshal the demons to oppose the gods. Taraka deceives Sam and possesses his body after his release, resulting in Sam and Taraka simultaneously living in Sam's body. The cohabitation leads them to each gain some of the traits of the other, but the effect is more pronounced upon Taraka, as he learns to feel sorrow, remorse, and guilt. Eventually, out of respect and as a sort of recompense, Taraka 'strengthens the flames' of Sam's soul, enabling him to live as an energy being like the Rakshasa do, if he should be killed. Taraka is killed by Yama's death gaze in the final battle, despite Sam's warnings.\n* [[Nirriti]] the Black was originally Renfrew, the chaplain of the colonists' ship. A staunch Christian, he is disgusted by the ascendancy of Hinduism on the planet and eventually sets himself up with an army of zombie soldiers to conquer and convert the planet. (Nirriti is portrayed as a solo megalomaniac, opposed to the pantheon of the Gods.) This character is deeply ironic, a Christian who comes to be known as \"The Dark Lord\", leader of an army of \"Soulless Ones\" who have no will of their own but kneel to accompany him in his prayers when so ordered. His final irony is to die in the arms of the false Buddha, Sam. As he dies, he asks for Sam's blessing, which is freely given.\n* [[Mara (demon)|Mara]], Lord of Illusion, can project complex illusions across great distances, a power that the Gods use both for entertainment and in battle. He is the one God who can stand against Sam and Yama at Keenset where both exert their full powers, being able to misdirect their attacks. Likewise he frustrates Sam's attempt to escape Heaven by confusing him as to the way out of the dome. Despite this his character is not much in evidence in the novel, only his actions. In the first story he appears in disguise attempting to find out what Yama is doing, but when confronted, apparently unable to use his powers of illusion effectively against Yama within a limited space, the Death God breaks his neck, thus killing him.\n* [[Krishna]] is seen only briefly, and as two different characters. He is characterized as a lord of music and dance, and he wields a power of divine drunkenness. He has enormous charisma. Krishna is mostly an apolitical libertine, but was said to be a deadly wrestler who \"broke the black demon [[Banasura|Bana]]\" during the battles between the colonists and the native inhabitants of the planet, which suggests that he was one of the First. Eventually, disgusted by the abusive practices of the Gods, he joins Sam's efforts to overthrow them. A 'false Krishna' also is mentioned, as when the original Krishna went missing a replacement was found.\n* [[Murugan]], who when introduced is a god of youth in an older body and is patiently awaiting a new body during the wedding of Yama and Kali.  He meets the real death when his new body is stolen by Sam during the reincarnation process.\n\n==Film version==\nIn 1979 it was announced that ''Lord of Light'' would be made into a 50 million dollar film. It was planned that the sets for the movie would be made permanent and become the core of a [[science fiction]] [[theme park]] to be built in [[Aurora, Colorado]].

The game follows protagonist [[Marcus Fenix]], a soldier in the Coalition of Ordered Governments tasked to lead a last-ditch effort to destroy the Locust Horde and save humanity. Two subsequent titles, ''[[Gears of War 2]]'' (2008) and ''[[Gears of War 3]]'' (2011), continued Fenix and humanity's ongoing conflict with the Locust Horde and Lambent forces.

Human civilization develops on Sera and endures a millennia-long conflict that leaves humanity on the brink of extinction. Sera's leaders broker an era of peace that ushers an era of scientific advancements and a cultural renaissance. Humanity's population sporadically grows and demands more energy provided by [[fossil fuel|fossil]] and [[nuclear power|nuclear fuels]]. Sera's scientists discover Imulsion, a naturally occurring substance that can be refined into a potent energy source. Imulsion solves Sera's energy crisis but ultimately creates great economic disparity. Nations with direct access to Imulsion prosper, while other nations fall into financial turmoil.\n  \nSera's citizens [[balkanize]] into two warring factions: the Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) and Union of Independent Republics (UIR). The ensuing 79-year strife, known as the Pendulum Wars, consumes millions of lives with both sides locked in a virtual stalemate. The UIR develops the 'Hammer of Dawn', a system of satellites capable of delivering precise and potent orbital-to-surface laser strikes. However, a contingent of COG commandos, led by [[Marcus Fenix]], Dominic Santiago, and Victor Hoffman launch a daring raid on a UIR stronghold and steal the schematics for the Hammer of Dawn. The UIR quickly surrenders after witnessing the Hammer of Dawn devastate one of their naval vessels after being completed by Marcus Fenix's father, scientist Adam Fenix.\n \nSix weeks after the COG and UIR agreed to an armistice, a race of creatures known as the Locust Horde unexpectedly emerge from Sera's depths and begin assaulting all human cities, wiping out 25% of the world population in the first 26 hours. The Locust Horde easily overwhelms the already battleworn COG forces during this surprise attack, referred to as 'Emergence Day'. The COG retreats to cities located on the Jacinto Plateau, their last bastion where the Locust cannot dig through, and reluctantly bombard their own cities with the Hammer of Dawn to halt the Locust Horde's offensive. The ensuing [[scorched earth]] tactic destroys much of Sera's cities and human population. The COG continues to operate out of the capital city of Ephyra and cities on the plateau such as Jacinto, while the surviving humans, known as Stranded, are left to wander through Sera's charred ruins. \n\nFive years after Emergence Day, the Locust reemerge and begin a campaign of occupying human cities located on the Jacinto Plateau to act as stepping stones in order to destroy Ephyra. Eventually, the Locust are able to emerge and overrun the COG capital of Ephyra ten years after Emergence Day. During the chaos, Marcus Fenix leads an unauthorized mission to save his father, Adam, from the Locust assault. However, a King Raven helicopter is shot down by the Locust Horde and crash-lands into the Fenix Estate, presumably killing Adam Fenix. The COG's leadership [[court martial]]s Marcus and sentences him to life imprisonment. After losing Ephyra, the remainder of the COG retreats to Jacinto City, which resides on the edge of the plateau against an ocean. \n\n''[[Gears of War (video game)|Gears of War]]'' is set fourteen years after the Locust emerged and attacked Sera's human population. The COG forces devise a last-ditch offensive to destroy the Locust Horde with the Lightmass Bomb, weaponized forms of Imulsion. Marcus Fenix, now a disgraced veteran, is reinstated into the COG army four years after imprisonment to supplement the COG's depleted ranks. Marcus joins his best friend, Dominic Santiago, on a mission to map the Locust Horde's tunnel network in preparation for the bombing. However, their unit is ambushed by Locust Ground forces and sustain heavy casualties. Fenix and Santiago regroup with two other survivors, Augustus Cole and Damon Baird, and continue their mission. Marcus ultimately prevails in not only mapping, but successfully deploying the Lightmass Bomb and crippling the Locust Horde. However, the Locust Queen, Myrrah, pledges to continue the war effort. \n\nIn the weeks following the Lightmass Bombing, the human population begins suffering from a condition known as Rustlung, a fatal disease caused by the inhalation of Imulsion fumes - due to the evaporation of Imulsion caused by the Lightmass Bomb. The Locust reemerge and brought with them a force allowing them to sink the cities on the Jacinto Plateau. Following the sinking of nearby cities Tollen and Montevado, and the desperate raid attacks on Jacinto City, the COG fears that the Locust might be trying to sink Jacinto as well. \n\nIn ''[[Gears of War 2]]'', the COG Forces in-turn deploy thousands of soldiers directly into the depths of Sera to directly battle the Locust Horde and stop their plans to sink Jacinto. The COG discovers after the sinking of Ilima City that the Locust have been using a gargantuan worm to sink the cities on the Jacinto Plateau. After killing the Riftworm, Delta Squad is then ordered to locate the Locust stronghold by accessing intel from a decommissioned COG laboratory called New Hope, which is full of genetically altered humans called Sires, which Marcus believes were experiments that led to the creation of the Locust Horde. Locating the Locust stronghold, Nexus, under Mount Kadar - the COG discovers during the battle that members of the Locust Horde are mutating from exposure from Imulsion into \u2018Lambent\u2019. These abominations have been forcing the Locust to abandon their underground civilization to try to claim the surface world as their new home. Marcus devises a plan to intentionally sink Jacinto and using the surrounding sea water to flood the Locust and Lambent tunnel network. The COG evacuate Jacinto just as the city collapses and drowns a majority of the Locust Horde.\n\nThe remaining population of the COG rediscover an island base never attacked by the Locust Horde called Vectes, with a town known as Pelruan. The Stranded gangs on the island threaten the safety of the town, but the COG and Stranded cease when the Lambent begin to overrun the island and surrounding ocean. Due to the underground being flooded, the Imulsion from the Hollow was raised into the surface of Sera, causing a pandemic and turning all life into Lambent organisms. The leader of the COG, Chairman Richard Prescott, is believed to be holding secrets from the population. Prescott then abandons the COG, forcing them to disband and live as nomads, surviving against the Lambent and Locust stragglers. \n\n''[[Gears of War 3]]'' is set seventeen years after Emergence Day. Set two years after the COG disbanded, Prescott returns to reveal that he kidnapped Marcus Fenix's father during the fall of Ephyra and transported him to a secret island facility known as Azura, and that Adam has created a device known as the Imulsion countermeasure that could neutralize both the Lambent and Locust. However, the island was attacked and is now occupied by Queen Myrrah and the remaining Locust forces. Marcus and his allies reach Azura after Dominic sacrifices himself to rescue his friends from imminent demise.  Adam is rescued and releases his anti-Imulsion weapon but reveals he infected himself with the Lambent contagion to develop the weapon. The Imulsion countermeasure vaporizes all Lambent, including Adam, and the crystallizes the Locust.  Marcus personally kills Myrrah and dedicates her demise to his fallen friends, family, and comrades.  \n\n''[[Gears of War: Judgment]]'', focuses on Baird and Cole during the early months after Emergence Day. With military cadet Sofia Hendrick and Garron Paduk, a former UIR soldier, they comprise the Kilo Squad. Baird disobeys orders to use a Lightmass Missile to destroy Locust forces and save survivors at Halvo Bay. Despite also killing the powerful Locust leader Karn, the squad is court-martialed because they disobeyed orders. But because they saved Col. Ezra Loomis and killed Karn, they avoid execution or imprisonment, with Baird demoted from lieutenant to private. A separate campaign, \"Aftermath\", portrays Baird, Cole, and Paduk in the hours before the activation of the anti-Imulsion energy wave.\n\nFollowing the end of the Locust War and Lambent Pandemic, the humans of Sera began to rebuild and started with reorganizing the Coalition of Ordered Governments. Led by First Minister Anya Stroud, wife of Marcus Fenix, the humans begin to rebuild civilization with the assistance of robotic engineers created by Damon Baird. The COG was successful in creating New Ephyra and other walled cities known as Settlements outside of New Ephyra. Following fertility treatment, Anya was able to bear Marcus Fenix's son, James Dominic \"JD\" Fenix. However, Anya later died from birthing complications and the COG began a more authoritarian rule - prompting many civilians to abandon the COG and live off the land, known as Outsiders. JD was then sent to boarding school and met best friend Delmont \"Del\" Walker. After joining the military, both JD and Del were forced to execute civilians during a protest in Settlement 2, prompting them to leave the COG and becoming Outsiders. They joined a village led by Reyna Diaz and her brother-in-law, Oscar. Reyna's daughter, Kait, became close with JD and Del.  \n\n''[[Gears of War 4]]'' takes place 25 years after the original ''Gears of War'' trilogy. JD, accompanied by Kait and Del, conduct frequent raids on COG fortifications to acquire various supplies. The three successfully fend off a COG counterattack only to have their encampment devastated by a new foe, called the Swarm. Kait's mother, Reyna, is captured during the chaos. JD, Kait, and Del reach out to Marcus, now a disgruntled COG expatriate, who reluctantly agrees to help them. The COG, led by First Minister Mina Jinn, pursue the group after erroneously believing they are behind a string of mass-kidnappings.  The four reach a Locust mass-burial site, where they uncover evidence suggesting that Adam Fenix's countermeasure caused the Locust Horde to enter a cocooned metamorphosis state. Their fears are confirmed when various Locust Horde soldiers attack them in conjunction with the Swarm. The group receives assistance from Damon Baird along with Augustus Cole and Samantha Byrne. They battle their way to the Swarm's hive and defeat multiple Swarm and Locust monstrosities.  However, they reach the hive to learn that Swarm's hive-mind has forcefully integrated with Reyna. Kait frees her mother, knowing she will die but will no longer suffer. Reyna gives Kait a parting gift that belonged to her mother \u2013 a necklace bearing the insignia of the Locust Queen, Myrrah.\n\nKait, JD, Del, and Marcus rejoin the COG and offer their intelligence to Jinn in order to help fight the Swarm. However, Kait begins to have nightmares and visions related to her mother, the Swarm, and the Locust - but refuses to tell the others about it. Marcus and Baird believe they will need the Hammer of Dawn back online to help defend against the upcoming war with the Swarm. Baird then uncovers additional Hammer of Dawn satellites at Azura. \n\nIn ''[[Gears 5]]'', JD, Kait, Del, and Marcus travel to Azura to launch the Hammer of Dawn satellites. Afterwards, they assist in the evacuation of Settlement 2 as the Swarm have begun their attack on COG Settlements. Four months later, Kait is captured by the Swarm and connects her to the Swarm hivemind, allowing her to control the Swarm to kill the humans, including her uncle. She's freed by Marcus and JD, but in her grief reveals that she's been having visions and nightmare and believes them to be messages by the Swarm, as evidenced by her amulet which bears the Locust symbol. Marcus then has Kait and Del find answers at the New Hope facility. After discovering New Hope and an additional lab in Mount Kadar, Kait and Del learn that the Locust were the result of genetic experiments done to human children sick with Rustlung and splicing them with the DNA of creatures in the Hollow. The mutant children, known as Sires, were then used to fertilize the stem cells of Myrrah, who was born with a genetic immunity to Imulsion. Kait then discovers that Myrrah was Reyna's mother, making Kait the next in line for Queen of the Swarm. She manages to disconnect herself from the Swarm hivemind, but in doing allowed Reyna to be awoken and become queen of the Swarm. The Swarm becomes stronger and more intelligent now that they have a queen and launch an attack against New Ephyra. Using the Hammer of Dawn, the COG is able to repel the Swarm attack, and Kait vows to kill Queen Reyna before she can attack again.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Gearsofwar108.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus Fenix, the player-controlled character, takes aim at a Locust Drone with a Lancer from behind [[Cover system|cover]]. The game uses an over-the-shoulder camera angle when displaying the targeting reticle.]]\n''Gears of War'' is a [[third-person shooter]] game, with its core concepts being derived from ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''{{'}}s \"over the shoulder\" perspective, ''[[Kill Switch (video game)|Kill Switch]]''{{'}}s [[Cover System (gaming)|cover system]], and ''[[Bionic Commando (arcade)|Bionic Commando]]''{{'}}s swinging action akin to moving between points of cover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6167213.html?action=convert&om_clk=latestnews&tag=latestnews;title;0|title=GameSpot \u2013 GDC 07: Cliffy B disassembles ''Gears'', mentions sequel|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref>  The series focuses on using cover to tactically engage the enemy in battle to avoid taking damage. While behind cover, the player can fire blindly and inaccurately at their opponent, or can look around the cover and aim carefully, though exposing himself to enemy fire; the player can also slide along cover, move between nearby cover, or vault over cover to race to a new point of cover. As the player takes damage, the \"Crimson Omen\" appears on the [[head up display|HUD]], becoming more defined as the player nears low health levels. The player can regenerate their health by staying out of harm's way for a short while. Should the player take too much damage, they will become incapacitated unless revived by a teammate; depending on game mode, the player may be able to recover from this state on their own, or may die after a short amount of time if not revived. When a combatant is down, a member of the other side may also attempt to execute the downed player via a \"curb stomp\" or other brutal methods. As well, some types of damage will immediately kill the player with no chance of revival, such as explosive damage. There are five levels on the first two games, but they are referred to as \"acts\" and each act is formed into a certain amount of chapters.\n\nPlayers in ''Gears'' can only carry four different weapons, with the exception of the fourth game, allowing two primary weapon slots that can carry weapons which include, but are not limited to: assault rifles, shotguns, a [[sniper rifle]], grenade launchers and an explosive [[bow and arrow|bow]]; one grenade slot, which may be filled with up to four grenades of a specific type (Fragmentation, Smoke, Ink and Incendiary), and one pistol-type weapon. Players can either obtain ammo or swap out their current weapons with any weapon dropped by a downed foe or from those scattered around the various maps. Most weapons feature the \"Active Reload\" ability: either after a weapon has depleted an ammo magazine or when the player starts a manual reload, a meter is shown on screen, and the player can attempt to stop the meter in a certain marked area. If the player stops the meter in the marked area, their reload will be completed faster than if they did not attempt an Active Reload, and if the player can stop the meter at a specific section of the marked area, they will gain a temporary slight damage boost with each reloaded shot and a faster reload. If the player stops the meter outside this area, their gun will become temporarily jammed and slow down the reload time. While most of the weapons are based on standard shooter archetypes, ''Gears''{{'}}s signature weapon is the Lancer, an assault rifle that has a mounted [[chainsaw]] [[bayonet]] which can be used in close quarter combat to instantly kill a standard foe. Most other weapons also can be used to bash opponents in melee, or in the case of grenades, can be stuck to a foe, exploding a few seconds later. In ''Gears of War 2'' and ''3'', all four types of grenades can be planted on any reachable surface, detonating when an opponent comes close to it. If the opponent spots the grenade, they can detonate it from a safe distance by shooting it.\n\nAll ''Gears'' games feature a campaign mode that can be played cooperatively with one other player. The two players take the roles of two COG soldiers, Marcus Fenix and Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago, as they fight the Locust. In the third game the campaign allows for up to four players to play together at the same time. The campaign mode features several levels of difficulty. At various times, the campaign will offer a choice of paths the first player can select; if the second player is present, they will be forced to take the other path. The third and fourth players in Gears of War 3 will be separated between the paths of the first and second players. In these areas, all players generally have to work together to get them through the section, such as by one player providing covering fire while the second player opens a switch that allows the first player to then proceed.\n\nThe competitive multiplayer mode in Gears 1 features 8 players while in Gears 2 features up to ten players split between COG and Locust forces in a number of gameplay types. Modes include \"Warzone\" and \"Execution\", both similar to a typical [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]], and \"Annex\" and \"King of the Hill\" where teams have to control a marked zone on the map. In the mode \"Guardian,\"(only in Gears 2) one member of each team is designated as the leader. As long as the leader is still alive, his or her teammates can respawn indefinitely. As soon as the leader is executed, his or her teammates can no longer respawn.\n\n''Gears of War 3'' features better AI, as in past games the AI went around the obstacle even if it had been destroyed. However, in ''Gears 3'' the AI will recognize that the obstacle has been destroyed and are free to walk over it.<ref>\"''Gears of War 3'',\" ''Game Informer'' 206 (June 2010): p40-49.</ref>\n\n==Games==\n{{VG timeline\n| 2006 = ''[[Gears of War (video game)|Gears of War]]''\n| 2008 = ''[[Gears of War 2]]''\n| 2011 = ''[[Gears of War 3]]''\n| 2013 = ''[[Gears of War: Judgment]]''\n| 2014 = Acquisition of series by Microsoft from Epic Games\n| 2015 = ''[[Gears of War (video game)#Ultimate Edition|Gears of War: Ultimate Edition]]''\n| 2016 = ''[[Gears of War 4]]''\n| 2019a = ''[[Gears Pop]]''\n| 2019b = ''[[Gears 5]]''\n| 2020a = ''[[Gears Tactics]]''\n}}\n\n===Main series===\n====''Gears of War''====\n{{Main|Gears of War (video game)}}\n''Gears of War'' is a [[third-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Epic Games]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]].

These are controlled by an [[AI]] deck of cards: after each player finishes their turn, they draw a card from the AI deck and takes actions for each Locust creature. Players play cards and roll dice to take actions as well as to resolve shooting and defense. The game proceeds until the player team successfully completes the mission.

In ''Gears of War 2'' there are collectibles which describe the end of Sgt. Jonathan Harper, a Gears veteran. He was captured by the Locust during the events of the Hollow. He managed to survive the vile deeds of the Locust Horde and escape. He helped a family reach safety, taking the bullets into his own body before falling to the ground.\n\nIssue number 9 begins a new arc, \"[[Gears of War (comics)#\"Barren\"|Barren]]\", of which the first part was released in September 2009. The \"other side\" of the life of humans faced by total annihilation are shown. Birthing creches, or breeding farms, filled with women who are there to just to give birth. With humanity dying out and no people to replace fallen Gears, new humans are needed. The story focuses on an escapee from one of these centers named Alex Brand. Declared to be barren at the age of 18, Brand was kicked from the breeding farm she was born in, sent to Boot Camp and trained to be a Gear. She accompanies Delta and Sigma Squads as they investigate a mysterious beacon call from the place at which she was born, which was thought to have been destroyed by Locust.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/52296 | title = Epic Games and DC Plan ''Gears of War'' Comic Book | date = 2008-04-18 | accessdate = 2008-04-18 | publisher = [[Shacknews]] | first = Aaron | last = Linde }}</ref><ref>[http://www.newsarama.com/comics/080723-GearsofWarcomic.html Ortega & Sharp on ''Gears of War'' Comic], [[Newsarama]], July 24, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.comicon.com/ubb/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=372151#Post372151 Sharp's Exclusive ''Gears of War'' Comic News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813174934/http://www.comicon.com/ubb/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=372151 |date=2009-08-13 }}, Comicon, August 11, 2008</ref>\n\n===Film===\n<!--\n**NOT TO EDITORS: PLEASE DO NOT COPY AND PASTE CONTENT PUBLISHED ON OTHER WEBSITES, THAT IS PLAGIARISM.\nANY INSTANCE OF PLAGIARIZED MATERIAL IN THIS ARTICLE WILL BE REMOVED.\nIF YOU YOU WISH TO ADD TO THIS SECTION, PLEASE PARAPHRASE, BE CONCISE AND UNDERSTANDABLE, AND ENSURE THAT ANY ADDITIONS ARE PROPERLY SOURCED.**\n-->\nOn March 21, 2007, it was announced that [[New Line Cinema]] had purchased the rights to make a ''Gears of War'' [[film]], with [[Stuart Beattie]] writing the script along with Marty Bowen and [[Wyck Godfrey]], who will be producing it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-line-grabs-gears-movie-rights/1100-6167729/|title=New Line grabs Gears movie rights|first=Tim|last=Surette|date=21 March 2007|website=gamespot.com}}</ref> Producer Wyck Godfrey said of the film adaptation, \"I'm not a gamer, but what blew me away about ''Gears'' was how it captures the mythology of a war mission and how high the stakes are.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/774/774558p1.html |title=IGN: ''Gears of War'' Gearing Up at New Line |publisher=Movies.ign.com |author=IGN Staff |accessdate=2008-10-27 }}</ref> On August 3, 2007, it was reported that [[Len Wiseman]] was to direct the movie adaptation of ''Gears of War'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinecon.com/news/1595/len-wiseman-officially-announced-as-gears-of-war-director/ |title=Len Wiseman officially announced as \"Gears of War\" director |publisher=Cinema Confidential |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate=2008-09-21}}</ref> though on March 30, 2007, Godfrey stated that they have \"a director we're about to attach\" in order to film the movie during 2009 and release in 2010.

The series focuses on the conflict between humanity, the subterranean reptilian hominids known as the Locust Horde, and their mutated counterparts, the Lambent. The franchise consists of six third-person shooter video games, which has also been supplemented by a comic book series and five novels.\n\nThe first installment, titled ''[[Gears of War (video game)|Gears of War]]'', was released on November 7, 2006 for the [[Xbox 360]]. The game follows protagonist [[Marcus Fenix]], a soldier in the Coalition of Ordered Governments tasked to lead a last-ditch effort to destroy the Locust Horde and save humanity. Two subsequent titles, ''[[Gears of War 2]]'' (2008) and ''[[Gears of War 3]]'' (2011), continued Fenix and humanity's ongoing conflict with the Locust Horde and Lambent forces. In 2013, Epic Games and Microsoft released ''[[Gears of War: Judgment]]'', a prequel to the series\u2019 first title, which instead focuses on Damon Baird, one of Fenix's squad-mates.<ref>{{cite news | first = Mitch | last = Dyer | title = Trial By Fire | date = 2013-03-17 | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/18/gears-of-war-judgment-review | work = [[IGN]] | accessdate = 2014-02-02}}</ref> ''Gears of War: Ultimate Edition'' was released for Microsoft Windows on March 1, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2015/06/gears-war-ultimate-edition-killer-instinct-coming-windows-10 |title=Gears of War: Ultimate Edition and Killer Instinct coming to Windows 10 |publisher=Gematsu |date=2014-07-31 |accessdate=2015-06-25}}</ref> The series' third sequel, ''[[Gears of War 4]]'', is set 25 years after ''Gears of War 3'' and follows Marcus Fenix's son, JD, as he battles a new resurrected Locust Horde that once again threatens humanity.<ref name=GOW4>{{cite web|url=http://www.dualshockers.com/2016/03/08/gears-of-war-4-gets-tons-of-new-details-on-game-informer/|title=Gears of War 4 Gets Tons of New Details on Game Informer|accessdate=April 8, 2016|website=DualShockers}}</ref> ''[[Gears 5]]'' (2019) revolves around Kait, a friend of JD, who embarks on a quest to learn her true origin and relation to the Locust Horde.\n\n''Gears of War'' was developed by Epic Games.

Human civilization develops on Sera and endures a millennia-long conflict that leaves humanity on the brink of extinction. Sera's leaders broker an era of peace that ushers an era of scientific advancements and a cultural renaissance. Humanity's population sporadically grows and demands more energy provided by [[fossil fuel|fossil]] and [[nuclear power|nuclear fuels]]. Sera's scientists discover Imulsion, a naturally occurring substance that can be refined into a potent energy source. Imulsion solves Sera's energy crisis but ultimately creates great economic disparity. Nations with direct access to Imulsion prosper, while other nations fall into financial turmoil.\n  \nSera's citizens [[balkanize]] into two warring factions: the Coalition of Ordered Governments (COG) and Union of Independent Republics (UIR). The ensuing 79-year strife, known as the Pendulum Wars, consumes millions of lives with both sides locked in a virtual stalemate. The UIR develops the 'Hammer of Dawn', a system of satellites capable of delivering precise and potent orbital-to-surface laser strikes. However, a contingent of COG commandos, led by [[Marcus Fenix]], Dominic Santiago, and Victor Hoffman launch a daring raid on a UIR stronghold and steal the schematics for the Hammer of Dawn. The UIR quickly surrenders after witnessing the Hammer of Dawn devastate one of their naval vessels after being completed by Marcus Fenix's father, scientist Adam Fenix.\n \nSix weeks after the COG and UIR agreed to an armistice, a race of creatures known as the Locust Horde unexpectedly emerge from Sera's depths and begin assaulting all human cities, wiping out 25% of the world population in the first 26 hours. The Locust Horde easily overwhelms the already battleworn COG forces during this surprise attack, referred to as 'Emergence Day'. The COG retreats to cities located on the Jacinto Plateau, their last bastion where the Locust cannot dig through, and reluctantly bombard their own cities with the Hammer of Dawn to halt the Locust Horde's offensive. The ensuing [[scorched earth]] tactic destroys much of Sera's cities and human population. The COG continues to operate out of the capital city of Ephyra and cities on the plateau such as Jacinto, while the surviving humans, known as Stranded, are left to wander through Sera's charred ruins. \n\nFive years after Emergence Day, the Locust reemerge and begin a campaign of occupying human cities located on the Jacinto Plateau to act as stepping stones in order to destroy Ephyra. Eventually, the Locust are able to emerge and overrun the COG capital of Ephyra ten years after Emergence Day. During the chaos, Marcus Fenix leads an unauthorized mission to save his father, Adam, from the Locust assault. However, a King Raven helicopter is shot down by the Locust Horde and crash-lands into the Fenix Estate, presumably killing Adam Fenix. The COG's leadership [[court martial]]s Marcus and sentences him to life imprisonment. After losing Ephyra, the remainder of the COG retreats to Jacinto City, which resides on the edge of the plateau against an ocean. \n\n''[[Gears of War (video game)|Gears of War]]'' is set fourteen years after the Locust emerged and attacked Sera's human population. The COG forces devise a last-ditch offensive to destroy the Locust Horde with the Lightmass Bomb, weaponized forms of Imulsion. Marcus Fenix, now a disgraced veteran, is reinstated into the COG army four years after imprisonment to supplement the COG's depleted ranks. Marcus joins his best friend, Dominic Santiago, on a mission to map the Locust Horde's tunnel network in preparation for the bombing. However, their unit is ambushed by Locust Ground forces and sustain heavy casualties. Fenix and Santiago regroup with two other survivors, Augustus Cole and Damon Baird, and continue their mission. Marcus ultimately prevails in not only mapping, but successfully deploying the Lightmass Bomb and crippling the Locust Horde. However, the Locust Queen, Myrrah, pledges to continue the war effort. \n\nIn the weeks following the Lightmass Bombing, the human population begins suffering from a condition known as Rustlung, a fatal disease caused by the inhalation of Imulsion fumes - due to the evaporation of Imulsion caused by the Lightmass Bomb. The Locust reemerge and brought with them a force allowing them to sink the cities on the Jacinto Plateau. Following the sinking of nearby cities Tollen and Montevado, and the desperate raid attacks on Jacinto City, the COG fears that the Locust might be trying to sink Jacinto as well. \n\nIn ''[[Gears of War 2]]'', the COG Forces in-turn deploy thousands of soldiers directly into the depths of Sera to directly battle the Locust Horde and stop their plans to sink Jacinto. The COG discovers after the sinking of Ilima City that the Locust have been using a gargantuan worm to sink the cities on the Jacinto Plateau. After killing the Riftworm, Delta Squad is then ordered to locate the Locust stronghold by accessing intel from a decommissioned COG laboratory called New Hope, which is full of genetically altered humans called Sires, which Marcus believes were experiments that led to the creation of the Locust Horde. Locating the Locust stronghold, Nexus, under Mount Kadar - the COG discovers during the battle that members of the Locust Horde are mutating from exposure from Imulsion into \u2018Lambent\u2019. These abominations have been forcing the Locust to abandon their underground civilization to try to claim the surface world as their new home. Marcus devises a plan to intentionally sink Jacinto and using the surrounding sea water to flood the Locust and Lambent tunnel network. The COG evacuate Jacinto just as the city collapses and drowns a majority of the Locust Horde.\n\nThe remaining population of the COG rediscover an island base never attacked by the Locust Horde called Vectes, with a town known as Pelruan. The Stranded gangs on the island threaten the safety of the town, but the COG and Stranded cease when the Lambent begin to overrun the island and surrounding ocean. Due to the underground being flooded, the Imulsion from the Hollow was raised into the surface of Sera, causing a pandemic and turning all life into Lambent organisms. The leader of the COG, Chairman Richard Prescott, is believed to be holding secrets from the population. Prescott then abandons the COG, forcing them to disband and live as nomads, surviving against the Lambent and Locust stragglers. \n\n''[[Gears of War 3]]'' is set seventeen years after Emergence Day. Set two years after the COG disbanded, Prescott returns to reveal that he kidnapped Marcus Fenix's father during the fall of Ephyra and transported him to a secret island facility known as Azura, and that Adam has created a device known as the Imulsion countermeasure that could neutralize both the Lambent and Locust. However, the island was attacked and is now occupied by Queen Myrrah and the remaining Locust forces. Marcus and his allies reach Azura after Dominic sacrifices himself to rescue his friends from imminent demise.  Adam is rescued and releases his anti-Imulsion weapon but reveals he infected himself with the Lambent contagion to develop the weapon. The Imulsion countermeasure vaporizes all Lambent, including Adam, and the crystallizes the Locust.  Marcus personally kills Myrrah and dedicates her demise to his fallen friends, family, and comrades.  \n\n''[[Gears of War: Judgment]]'', focuses on Baird and Cole during the early months after Emergence Day. With military cadet Sofia Hendrick and Garron Paduk, a former UIR soldier, they comprise the Kilo Squad. Baird disobeys orders to use a Lightmass Missile to destroy Locust forces and save survivors at Halvo Bay. Despite also killing the powerful Locust leader Karn, the squad is court-martialed because they disobeyed orders. But because they saved Col. Ezra Loomis and killed Karn, they avoid execution or imprisonment, with Baird demoted from lieutenant to private. A separate campaign, \"Aftermath\", portrays Baird, Cole, and Paduk in the hours before the activation of the anti-Imulsion energy wave.\n\nFollowing the end of the Locust War and Lambent Pandemic, the humans of Sera began to rebuild and started with reorganizing the Coalition of Ordered Governments. Led by First Minister Anya Stroud, wife of Marcus Fenix, the humans begin to rebuild civilization with the assistance of robotic engineers created by Damon Baird. The COG was successful in creating New Ephyra and other walled cities known as Settlements outside of New Ephyra. Following fertility treatment, Anya was able to bear Marcus Fenix's son, James Dominic \"JD\" Fenix. However, Anya later died from birthing complications and the COG began a more authoritarian rule - prompting many civilians to abandon the COG and live off the land, known as Outsiders. JD was then sent to boarding school and met best friend Delmont \"Del\" Walker. After joining the military, both JD and Del were forced to execute civilians during a protest in Settlement 2, prompting them to leave the COG and becoming Outsiders. They joined a village led by Reyna Diaz and her brother-in-law, Oscar. Reyna's daughter, Kait, became close with JD and Del.  \n\n''[[Gears of War 4]]'' takes place 25 years after the original ''Gears of War'' trilogy. JD, accompanied by Kait and Del, conduct frequent raids on COG fortifications to acquire various supplies. The three successfully fend off a COG counterattack only to have their encampment devastated by a new foe, called the Swarm. Kait's mother, Reyna, is captured during the chaos. JD, Kait, and Del reach out to Marcus, now a disgruntled COG expatriate, who reluctantly agrees to help them. The COG, led by First Minister Mina Jinn, pursue the group after erroneously believing they are behind a string of mass-kidnappings.  The four reach a Locust mass-burial site, where they uncover evidence suggesting that Adam Fenix's countermeasure caused the Locust Horde to enter a cocooned metamorphosis state. Their fears are confirmed when various Locust Horde soldiers attack them in conjunction with the Swarm. The group receives assistance from Damon Baird along with Augustus Cole and Samantha Byrne. They battle their way to the Swarm's hive and defeat multiple Swarm and Locust monstrosities.  However, they reach the hive to learn that Swarm's hive-mind has forcefully integrated with Reyna. Kait frees her mother, knowing she will die but will no longer suffer. Reyna gives Kait a parting gift that belonged to her mother \u2013 a necklace bearing the insignia of the Locust Queen, Myrrah.\n\nKait, JD, Del, and Marcus rejoin the COG and offer their intelligence to Jinn in order to help fight the Swarm. However, Kait begins to have nightmares and visions related to her mother, the Swarm, and the Locust - but refuses to tell the others about it. Marcus and Baird believe they will need the Hammer of Dawn back online to help defend against the upcoming war with the Swarm. Baird then uncovers additional Hammer of Dawn satellites at Azura. \n\nIn ''[[Gears 5]]'', JD, Kait, Del, and Marcus travel to Azura to launch the Hammer of Dawn satellites. Afterwards, they assist in the evacuation of Settlement 2 as the Swarm have begun their attack on COG Settlements. Four months later, Kait is captured by the Swarm and connects her to the Swarm hivemind, allowing her to control the Swarm to kill the humans, including her uncle. She's freed by Marcus and JD, but in her grief reveals that she's been having visions and nightmare and believes them to be messages by the Swarm, as evidenced by her amulet which bears the Locust symbol. Marcus then has Kait and Del find answers at the New Hope facility. After discovering New Hope and an additional lab in Mount Kadar, Kait and Del learn that the Locust were the result of genetic experiments done to human children sick with Rustlung and splicing them with the DNA of creatures in the Hollow. The mutant children, known as Sires, were then used to fertilize the stem cells of Myrrah, who was born with a genetic immunity to Imulsion. Kait then discovers that Myrrah was Reyna's mother, making Kait the next in line for Queen of the Swarm. She manages to disconnect herself from the Swarm hivemind, but in doing allowed Reyna to be awoken and become queen of the Swarm. The Swarm becomes stronger and more intelligent now that they have a queen and launch an attack against New Ephyra. Using the Hammer of Dawn, the COG is able to repel the Swarm attack, and Kait vows to kill Queen Reyna before she can attack again.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Gearsofwar108.jpg|thumb|right|Marcus Fenix, the player-controlled character, takes aim at a Locust Drone with a Lancer from behind [[Cover system|cover]]. The game uses an over-the-shoulder camera angle when displaying the targeting reticle.]]\n''Gears of War'' is a [[third-person shooter]] game, with its core concepts being derived from ''[[Resident Evil 4]]''{{'}}s \"over the shoulder\" perspective, ''[[Kill Switch (video game)|Kill Switch]]''{{'}}s [[Cover System (gaming)|cover system]], and ''[[Bionic Commando (arcade)|Bionic Commando]]''{{'}}s swinging action akin to moving between points of cover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6167213.html?action=convert&om_clk=latestnews&tag=latestnews;title;0|title=GameSpot \u2013 GDC 07: Cliffy B disassembles ''Gears'', mentions sequel|accessdate=2007-07-05}}</ref>  The series focuses on using cover to tactically engage the enemy in battle to avoid taking damage. While behind cover, the player can fire blindly and inaccurately at their opponent, or can look around the cover and aim carefully, though exposing himself to enemy fire; the player can also slide along cover, move between nearby cover, or vault over cover to race to a new point of cover. As the player takes damage, the \"Crimson Omen\" appears on the [[head up display|HUD]], becoming more defined as the player nears low health levels. The player can regenerate their health by staying out of harm's way for a short while. Should the player take too much damage, they will become incapacitated unless revived by a teammate; depending on game mode, the player may be able to recover from this state on their own, or may die after a short amount of time if not revived. When a combatant is down, a member of the other side may also attempt to execute the downed player via a \"curb stomp\" or other brutal methods. As well, some types of damage will immediately kill the player with no chance of revival, such as explosive damage. There are five levels on the first two games, but they are referred to as \"acts\" and each act is formed into a certain amount of chapters.\n\nPlayers in ''Gears'' can only carry four different weapons, with the exception of the fourth game, allowing two primary weapon slots that can carry weapons which include, but are not limited to: assault rifles, shotguns, a [[sniper rifle]], grenade launchers and an explosive [[bow and arrow|bow]]; one grenade slot, which may be filled with up to four grenades of a specific type (Fragmentation, Smoke, Ink and Incendiary), and one pistol-type weapon. Players can either obtain ammo or swap out their current weapons with any weapon dropped by a downed foe or from those scattered around the various maps. Most weapons feature the \"Active Reload\" ability: either after a weapon has depleted an ammo magazine or when the player starts a manual reload, a meter is shown on screen, and the player can attempt to stop the meter in a certain marked area. If the player stops the meter in the marked area, their reload will be completed faster than if they did not attempt an Active Reload, and if the player can stop the meter at a specific section of the marked area, they will gain a temporary slight damage boost with each reloaded shot and a faster reload. If the player stops the meter outside this area, their gun will become temporarily jammed and slow down the reload time. While most of the weapons are based on standard shooter archetypes, ''Gears''{{'}}s signature weapon is the Lancer, an assault rifle that has a mounted [[chainsaw]] [[bayonet]] which can be used in close quarter combat to instantly kill a standard foe. Most other weapons also can be used to bash opponents in melee, or in the case of grenades, can be stuck to a foe, exploding a few seconds later. In ''Gears of War 2'' and ''3'', all four types of grenades can be planted on any reachable surface, detonating when an opponent comes close to it. If the opponent spots the grenade, they can detonate it from a safe distance by shooting it.\n\nAll ''Gears'' games feature a campaign mode that can be played cooperatively with one other player. The two players take the roles of two COG soldiers, Marcus Fenix and Dominic \"Dom\" Santiago, as they fight the Locust. In the third game the campaign allows for up to four players to play together at the same time. The campaign mode features several levels of difficulty. At various times, the campaign will offer a choice of paths the first player can select; if the second player is present, they will be forced to take the other path. The third and fourth players in Gears of War 3 will be separated between the paths of the first and second players. In these areas, all players generally have to work together to get them through the section, such as by one player providing covering fire while the second player opens a switch that allows the first player to then proceed.\n\nThe competitive multiplayer mode in Gears 1 features 8 players while in Gears 2 features up to ten players split between COG and Locust forces in a number of gameplay types. Modes include \"Warzone\" and \"Execution\", both similar to a typical [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]], and \"Annex\" and \"King of the Hill\" where teams have to control a marked zone on the map. In the mode \"Guardian,\"(only in Gears 2) one member of each team is designated as the leader. As long as the leader is still alive, his or her teammates can respawn indefinitely. As soon as the leader is executed, his or her teammates can no longer respawn.\n\n''Gears of War 3'' features better AI, as in past games the AI went around the obstacle even if it had been destroyed. However, in ''Gears 3'' the AI will recognize that the obstacle has been destroyed and are free to walk over it.<ref>\"''Gears of War 3'',\" ''Game Informer'' 206 (June 2010): p40-49.</ref>\n\n==Games==\n{{VG timeline\n| 2006 = ''[[Gears of War (video game)|Gears of War]]''\n| 2008 = ''[[Gears of War 2]]''\n| 2011 = ''[[Gears of War 3]]''\n| 2013 = ''[[Gears of War: Judgment]]''\n| 2014 = Acquisition of series by Microsoft from Epic Games\n| 2015 = ''[[Gears of War (video game)#Ultimate Edition|Gears of War: Ultimate Edition]]''\n| 2016 = ''[[Gears of War 4]]''\n| 2019a = ''[[Gears Pop]]''\n| 2019b = ''[[Gears 5]]''\n| 2020a = ''[[Gears Tactics]]''\n}}\n\n===Main series===\n====''Gears of War''====\n{{Main|Gears of War (video game)}}\n''Gears of War'' is a [[third-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Epic Games]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]].

Designed by Corey Konieczka, it is a [[cooperative game]] for up to four players, including the option for solo play. Each player takes control of a COG (represented by a miniature figure pre-painted in red), fighting their way through randomly generated maps filled with Locust soldiers (represented by a miniature figure pre-painted in light gray). These are controlled by an [[AI]] deck of cards: after each player finishes their turn, they draw a card from the AI deck and takes actions for each Locust creature. Players play cards and roll dice to take actions as well as to resolve shooting and defense. The game proceeds until the player team successfully completes the mission. There are seven different missions, each featuring different objectives and enemies in randomly generated map layouts. Since its launch, the game has received one expansion, ''Mission Pack 1'', which brought more weapons, two new missions and new enemies, including General RAAM.\n\n===Books===\nA series of novels based on the ''Gears of War'' series were written by [[Karen Traviss]].

Issue 7, \"The Quickening\", followed the life of [[List of Gears of War characters#Tai Kaliso|Tai Kaliso]] from his home in the South Islands to the torture den of the Locust Horde. This was released on June 9, 2009.\n\nThe second stand-alone was \"[[Gears of War (comics)#\"Harper's Story\"|Harper's Story]]\". In ''Gears of War 2'' there are collectibles which describe the end of Sgt. Jonathan Harper, a Gears veteran. He was captured by the Locust during the events of the Hollow.

He helped a family reach safety, taking the bullets into his own body before falling to the ground.\n\nIssue number 9 begins a new arc, \"[[Gears of War (comics)#\"Barren\"|Barren]]\", of which the first part was released in September 2009.

In 1984, he starred in the hit comedy film ''[[Revenge of the Nerds]]'' playing the main role of Gilbert Lowe, a sensitive and well-meaning nerd, Lewis' (played by [[Robert Carradine]]) best friend and later president of the Tri-Lambs.

It was Edwards' role as [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|LTJG]] Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw alongside [[Tom Cruise]] in the 1986 film ''[[Top Gun]]'' that brought his first widespread public acknowledgment. His character, who died in an aviation accident, was among the most prominent and popular in the film. He appeared as a terminally ill patient in ''[[Hawks (film)|Hawks]]'' (1988) alongside [[Timothy Dalton]], another role which brought him worldwide fame.

I dont that she has done so yet, it is distressing.\"{{sic}}]]\n\nThe '''Donner Party''' (sometimes called the '''Donner\u2013Reed Party''') was a group of [[American pioneer]]s who migrated to [[California]] in a [[wagon train]] from the [[Midwest]]. Delayed by a series of mishaps, they spent the winter of 1846\u201347 snowbound in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range. Some of the migrants resorted to [[cannibalism]] to survive, eating the bodies of those who had succumbed to starvation and sickness.\n\nThe Donner Party departed [[Missouri]] on the [[Oregon Trail]] in the spring of 1846, behind many other pioneer families who were attempting to make the same overland trip. The journey west usually took between four and six months, but the Donner Party was slowed after electing to follow a new route called the [[Hastings Cutoff]], which bypassed established trails and instead crossed [[Utah]]'s [[Wasatch Mountains]] and the [[Great Salt Lake Desert]]. The desolate and rugged terrain, and the difficulties they later encountered while traveling along the [[Humboldt River]] in present-day [[Nevada]], resulted in the loss of many cattle and wagons, and divisions soon formed within the group.\n\nBy early November, the migrants had reached the Sierra Nevada but became trapped by an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee Lake (now [[Donner Lake]]) high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran dangerously low, and in mid-December some of the group set out on foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach the migrants, but the first relief party did not arrive until the middle of February 1847, almost four months after the wagon train became trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived the ordeal. Historians have described the episode as one of the most spectacular tragedies in California history, and in the entire record of American westward migration.<ref>McGlashan, p. 16; Stewart, p. 271.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Humboldt River Papa 2.jpg|thumb|An encampment of tents and covered wagons on the [[Humboldt River]] in Nevada, 1859]]<!-- needs [[WP:ALT]] -->\nDuring the 1840s, the United States saw a dramatic increase in settlers who left their homes in the east to resettle in the [[Oregon Territory]] or California, which at the time were only accessible by a very long sea voyage or a daunting overland journey across the American frontier. Some, such as Patrick Breen, saw California as a place where they would be free to live in a fully Catholic culture;<ref name=Enright1954>Enright, John Shea (December 1954). \"The Breens of San Juan Bautista: With a Calendar of Family Papers\", ''[[California Historical Society Quarterly]]'' '''33''' (4) pp. 349\u2013359.</ref> others were attracted to the West's burgeoning economic opportunities or inspired by the idea of [[manifest destiny]], the belief that the land between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans belonged to European Americans and that they should settle it.<ref>Rarick, p. 11.</ref> Most wagon trains followed the [[Oregon Trail]] route from a starting point in [[Independence, Missouri]], to the [[Continental Divide of the Americas]], traveling about {{convert|15|mi}} a day<ref name=rarick18and24and45>Rarick, pp. 18, 24, 45.</ref> on a journey that usually took between four and six months.<ref name=bagley130>Bagley, p. 130.</ref> The trail generally followed rivers to [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]], a [[mountain pass]] in present-day [[Wyoming]] which was relatively easy for wagons to negotiate.<ref name=rarick48>Rarick, p. 48.</ref> From there, pioneers had a choice of routes to their destinations.<ref name=rarick45>Rarick, p. 45.</ref>\n\n[[Lansford Hastings]], an early migrant from Ohio to the West, went to California in 1842 and saw the promise of the undeveloped country.

A smaller group opted to head for Fort Bridger and needed a leader. Most of the younger men in the group were European immigrants and not considered to be ideal leaders. James Reed had lived in the U.S. for a considerable time, was older, and had military experience, but his autocratic attitude had rubbed many in the party the wrong way, and they saw him as aristocratic, imperious, and ostentatious.<ref>Stewart, pp. 16\u201318.</ref> By comparison, the mature, experienced, American-born Donner's peaceful and charitable nature made him the group's first choice.<ref>Stewart, p. 14.</ref> The members of the party were comfortably well-off by contemporaneous standards.<ref name=rarick17/> Although they are called pioneers, most of the party lacked skills and experience for traveling through mountains and arid land. Additionally, the party had little knowledge about how to interact with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref>Stewart, pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nJournalist [[Edwin Bryant (alcalde)|Edwin Bryant]] reached Blacks Fork a week ahead of the Donner Party. He saw the first part of the trail and was concerned that it would be difficult for the wagons in the Donner group, especially with so many women and children. He returned to Blacks Fork to leave letters warning several members of the group not to take Hastings' shortcut.<ref>Rarick, p. 56.</ref> By the time the Donner Party reached Blacks Fork on July 27, Hastings had already left, leading the forty wagons of the Harlan-Young group.<ref name=Andrews1973/> Because Jim Bridger's trading post would fare substantially better if people used the Hastings Cutoff, he told the party that the shortcut was a smooth trip, devoid of rugged country and hostile Native Americans, and would therefore shorten their journey by {{convert|350|mi|km}}. Water would be easy to find along the way, although a couple of days crossing a {{convert|30|\u2013|40|mi|km|adj=on}} dry lake bed would be necessary.\n\nReed was very impressed with this information and advocated for the Hastings Cutoff. None of the party received Bryant's letters warning them to avoid Hastings' route at all costs; in his diary account, Bryant states his conviction that Bridger deliberately concealed the letters, a view shared by Reed in his later testimony.<ref name=Andrews1973/><ref>Stewart, pp. 25\u201327; Rarick, p. 58.</ref> At Fort Laramie, Reed met an old friend named James Clyman who was coming from California. Clyman warned Reed not to take the Hastings Cutoff, telling him that wagons would not be able to make it and that Hastings' information was inaccurate.<ref>Rarick, p. 47.</ref> Fellow pioneer [[Jesse Quinn Thornton]] traveled part of the way with Donner and Reed, and in his book ''From Oregon and California in 1848'' declared Hastings the \"[[Baron Munchausen]] of travelers in these countries\".<ref>Johnson, p. 20</ref> Tamsen Donner, according to Thornton, was \"gloomy, sad, and dispirited\" at the thought of turning off the main trail on the advice of Hastings, whom she considered \"a selfish adventurer\".<ref>Johnson, p. 22.</ref>\n\nOn July 31, 1846, the party left Blacks Fork after four days of rest and wagon repairs, eleven days behind the leading Harlan-Young group. Donner hired a replacement driver, and the company was joined by the McCutcheon family, consisting of 30-year-old William, his 24-year-old wife Amanda, two-year-old daughter Harriet, and a 16-year-old named Jean Baptiste Trudeau from New Mexico, who claimed to have knowledge of the Native Americans and terrain on the way to California.<ref>Stewart, p. 28.</ref>\n\n===Wasatch Mountains===\n[[File:Big Cottonwood Canyon, Utah.JPG|thumb|Big Cottonwood Canyon, located several miles south of the Donner route in the heart of the Wasatch mountains of Northern Utah]]\n\nThe party turned south to follow the Hastings Cutoff. Within days, they found the terrain to be much more difficult than described. Drivers were forced to lock the wheels of their wagons to prevent them from rolling down steep inclines. Several years of traffic on the main Oregon Trail had left an easy and obvious path, whereas the Cutoff was more difficult to find. Hastings wrote directions and left letters stuck to trees. On August 6, the party found a letter from him advising them to stop until he could show them an alternate route to that taken by the Harlan-Young Party.<ref group=upper-alpha>While Hastings was otherwise occupied, his guides had led the Harlan-Young Party through [[Weber Canyon]], which was not the route that Hastings had intended to take. (Rarick, p. 61)</ref> Reed, Charles T. Stanton, and William Pike rode ahead to get Hastings. They encountered exceedingly difficult canyons where boulders had to be moved and walls cut off precariously to a river below, a route likely to break wagons. In his letter Hastings had offered to guide the Donner Party around the more difficult areas, but he rode back only part way, indicating the general direction to follow.<ref>Stewart, pp. 31\u201335.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 61\u201362.</ref>\n\nStanton and Pike stopped to rest, and Reed returned alone to the group, arriving four days after the party's departure. Without the guide they had been promised, the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan-Young Party through the difficult terrain of [[Weber Canyon]], or forge their own trail in the direction that Hastings had recommended. At Reed's urging, the group chose the new Hastings route.<ref>Rarick, pp. 64\u201365.</ref> Their progress slowed to about one and a half miles (2.4 km) a day. All able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees, and heave rocks to make room for the wagons.<ref group=upper-alpha>The route that the party followed is now known as [[Emigration Canyon, Utah|Emigration Canyon]]. (Johnson, p. 28)</ref>\n\nAs the Donner Party made its way across the [[Wasatch Mountains]], the Graves family, who had set off to find them, reached them. They consisted of 57-year-old Franklin Ward Graves, his 47-year-old wife Elizabeth, their children Mary (20), William (18), Eleanor (15), Lovina (13), Nancy (9), Jonathan (7), Franklin, Jr. (5), Elizabeth (1), and married daughter Sarah (22), plus son-in-law Jay Fosdick (23), and a 25-year-old teamster named John Snyder, traveling together in three wagons. Their arrival brought the Donner Party to 87 members in 60\u201380 wagons.<ref>Rarick, pp. 67\u201368, Johnson, p. 25.</ref> The Graves family had been part of the last group to leave Missouri, confirming the Donner Party was at the back of the year's western exodus.<ref name=rarick68>Rarick, p. 68.</ref>\n\nIt was August 20 by the time that they reached a point in the mountains where they could look down and see the [[Great Salt Lake]]. It took almost another two weeks to travel out of the Wasatch Mountains. The men began arguing, and doubts were expressed about the wisdom of those who had chosen this route, in particular James Reed. Food and supplies began to run out for some of the less affluent families. Stanton and Pike had ridden out with Reed but had become lost on their way back; by the time that the party found them, they were a day away from eating their horses.<ref>Stewart, pp. 36\u201339.</ref>\n\n===Great Salt Lake Desert===\n[[File:Butte in Great Salt Lake Desert-750px.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Flat expanse with a mountain range in the distance|[[Great Salt Lake Desert]]]]\n\nLuke Halloran died of [[tuberculosis]] on August 25. A few days later, the party came across a torn and tattered letter from Hastings. The pieces indicated there were two days and nights of difficult travel ahead without grass or water. The party rested their oxen and prepared for the trip.<ref name=rarick70and71>Rarick, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> After 36&nbsp;hours they set off to traverse a {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} mountain that lay in their path. From its peak, they saw ahead of them a dry, barren plain, perfectly flat and covered with white salt, larger than the one they had just crossed,<ref name=stewart40to44/> and \"one of the most inhospitable places on earth\" according to Rarick.<ref name=rarick69>Rarick, p. 69.</ref> Their oxen were already fatigued, and their water was nearly gone.<ref name=stewart40to44>Stewart, pp. 40\u201344.</ref>\n\nThe party pressed onward on August 30, having no alternative. In the heat of the day, the moisture underneath the salt crust rose to the surface and turned it into a gummy mass. The wagon wheels sank into it, in some cases up to the hubs. The days were blisteringly hot and the nights frigid. Several of the group saw visions of lakes and wagon trains and believed they had finally overtaken Hastings. After three days, the water was gone, and some of the party removed their oxen from the wagons to press ahead to find more. Some of the animals were so weakened they were left yoked to the wagons and abandoned. Nine of Reed's ten oxen broke free, crazed with thirst, and bolted off into the desert. Many other families' cattle and horses had also gone missing. The rigors of the journey resulted in irreparable damage to some of the wagons, but no human lives had been lost. Instead of the promised two-day journey over {{convert|40|mi}}, the journey across the {{convert|80|mi}} of [[Great Salt Lake Desert]] had taken six.<ref>Stewart, pp. 44\u201350.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 72\u201374.</ref><ref group=upper-alpha>In 1986, a team of archaeologists attempted to cross the same stretch of desert at the same time of year in four-wheel drive trucks and were unable to do so.

He suggested that two men should go to [[Sutter's Fort]] in California; he had heard that [[John Sutter]] was exceedingly generous to wayward pioneers and could assist them with extra provisions. Charles Stanton and William McCutchen volunteered to undertake the dangerous trip.<ref>Rarick, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> The remaining serviceable wagons were pulled by mongrel teams of cows, oxen, and mules. It was the middle of September, and two young men who went in search of missing oxen reported that another {{convert|40|mi}} of [[Lahontan Valley|desert]] lay ahead.<ref name=stewart50to53>Stewart, pp. 50\u201353.</ref>\n\nTheir cattle and oxen were now exhausted and lean, but the Donner Party crossed the next stretch of desert relatively unscathed. The journey seemed to get easier, particularly through the valley next to the [[Ruby Mountains]]. Despite their near hatred of Hastings, they had no choice but to follow his tracks, which were weeks old. On September 26, two months after embarking on the cutoff, the Donner Party rejoined the traditional trail along a stream that became known as the [[Humboldt River]]. The shortcut had probably delayed them by a month.<ref name=\"Stewart, pp. 54\u201358\">Stewart, pp. 54\u201358.</ref><ref name=rarick80and81>Rarick, pp. 78\u201381.</ref>\n\n==Rejoining the trail==\n\n===Reed banished===\n\nAlong the Humboldt, the group met [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Native Americans, who joined them for a couple of days but stole or shot several oxen and horses. By now, it was well into October, and the Donner families split off to make better time. Two wagons in the remaining group became tangled, and John Snyder angrily beat the ox of Reed's hired teamster Milt Elliott. When Reed intervened, Snyder turned the whip on him. Reed retaliated by fatally plunging a knife under Snyder's collarbone.<ref name=\"Stewart, pp. 54\u201358\"/><ref name=rarick80and81 />\n\nThat evening, the witnesses gathered to discuss what was to be done.

With nearly all his cattle gone, Wolfinger stopped at the [[Humboldt Sink]] to cache (bury) his wagon; Reinhardt and Spitzer stayed behind to help.

Margret Reed and her children were also now without a wagon.<ref name=rarick98>Rarick, p. 98.</ref><ref name=stewart67to74/> But the desert soon came to an end, and the party found the [[Truckee River]] in beautiful lush country.<ref name=stewart67to74>Stewart, pp. 67\u201374.</ref>\n\nThey had little time to rest. The company pressed on to cross the Sierra Nevada before the snows came.

George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood but it seemed a superficial wound.<ref>Stewart, pp. 81\u201383.</ref>\n\nSnow began to fall. The Breens made it up the \"massive, nearly vertical slope\" {{convert|1000|ft|m}} to Truckee Lake (now known as [[Donner Lake]]), {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the summit, and camped near a cabin that had been built two years earlier by another group of pioneers.<ref>Rarick, p. 108.</ref><ref group=upper-alpha>The cabins were built by three members of another group of migrants known as the Stevens Party, specifically by Joseph Foster, Allen Stevens, and Moses Schallenberger in November 1844.

Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and the Murphys another, and the Reeds and the Graves the third. Keseberg built a [[lean-to]] for his family against the side of the Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, six of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: six men, three women, and twelve children in all.<ref>Stewart, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref><ref>Hardesty, p. 60.</ref> It began to snow again on the evening of November 4\u2014the beginning of a storm that lasted eight days.<ref>Stewart, pp. 84\u201387.</ref>\n\nBy the time the party made camp, very little food remained from the supplies that Stanton had brought back from Sutter's Fort. The oxen began to die, and their carcasses were frozen and stacked. Truckee Lake was not yet frozen, but the pioneers were unfamiliar with catching lake trout. Eddy, the most experienced hunter, killed a bear, but had little luck after that. The Reed and Eddy families had lost almost everything. Margret Reed promised to pay double when they got to California for the use of three oxen from the Graves and Breen families. Graves charged Eddy $25\u2014normally the cost of two healthy oxen\u2014for the carcass of an ox that had starved to death.<ref>Stewart, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref><ref>Johnson, p. 44.</ref>\n\nDesperation grew in camp and some reasoned that individuals might succeed in navigating the pass where the wagons could not. On November 12, the storm abated, and a small party tried to reach the summit on foot but found the trek through the soft, deep powder too difficult, and returned that same evening. Over the next week, two more attempts were made by other small parties, but both quickly failed. On November 21, a large party of about 22 persons successfully reached the peak. The party traveled about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} west of the summit, but this trip too was aborted, and they returned to the lake on November 23.\n\n[[File:Truckee Lake camp.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's rendering of the Truckee Lake camp based on descriptions by William Graves<ref group=upper-alpha>This drawing is inaccurate in several respects: the cabins were spread so far apart that Patrick Breen in his diary came to call inhabitants of other cabins \"strangers\" whose visits were rare. Furthermore, this scene shows a great deal of activity and livestock, when the migrants were weakened already by low rations and livestock began to die almost immediately. It also neglects to include the snow that met the migrants from the day they arrived.</ref>|alt=Three log cabins with flat roofs set in the midst of tall trees, with mountains in the background.

He concerned himself primarily with the weather, marking the storms and how much snow had fallen, but gradually began to include references to God and religion in his entries.<ref>Rarick, p. 145.</ref> Life at Truckee Lake was miserable. The cabins were cramped and filthy, and it snowed so much that people were unable to go outdoors for days. Diets soon consisted of oxhide, strips of which were boiled to make a \"disagreeable\" glue-like jelly. Ox and horse bones were boiled repeatedly to make soup, and they became so brittle that they would crumble upon chewing. Sometimes they were softened by being charred and eaten. Bit by bit, the Murphy children picked apart the oxhide rug that lay in front of their fireplace, roasted it in the fire, and ate it.<ref>McGlashan, p. 90.</ref> After the departure of the snowshoe party, two-thirds of the migrants at Truckee Lake were children. Mrs. Graves was in charge of eight, and Levinah Murphy and Eleanor Eddy together took care of nine.<ref>Rarick, p. 146.</ref> Migrants caught and ate mice that strayed into their cabins. Many of the people at Truckee Lake were soon weakened and spent most of their time in bed. Occasionally one would be able to make the full-day trek to see the Donners. News came that Jacob Donner and three hired men had died. One of them, Joseph Reinhardt, confessed on his deathbed that he had murdered Wolfinger.<ref>Johnson, p. 40.

Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning that it would be better to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graves came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.<ref>Stewart, pp. 168\u2013175.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 148\u2013150.</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===\"The Forlorn Hope\"===\n{| class=\"wikitable infobox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em;;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Members of \"The Forlorn Hope\"\n|-\n!

Spitzer died, then Baylis Williams (a driver for the Reeds) also died, more from malnutrition than starvation. Franklin Graves fashioned 14 pairs of [[snowshoe]]s out of [[oxbow]]s and hide. A party of 17 men, women, and children set out on foot in an attempt to cross the mountain pass.<ref>McGlashan pp. 66\u201367.</ref> As evidence of how grim their choices were, four of the men were fathers. Three of the women, who were mothers, gave their young children to other women.

The members of the party were neither well-nourished nor accustomed to camping in snow {{convert|12|ft|m}} deep and, by the third day, most were [[Snow blindness|snowblind]]. On the sixth day, Eddy discovered his wife had hidden a half-pound of bear meat in his pack. The group set out again the morning of December 21; Stanton had been straggling for several days, and he remained behind, saying he would follow shortly.

After two more days without food, Patrick Dolan proposed one of them should volunteer to die in order to feed the others. Some suggested a duel, while another account describes an attempt to create a lottery to choose a member to sacrifice.<ref name=rarick136/><ref>Thornton, J.

He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy. They dried them to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.<ref>Stewart, pp. 131\u2013133.</ref><ref>Thornton, J.

They began taking apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left.<ref>Thornton, J.

Reed made it out of the Sierra Nevada to [[Rancho Johnson]] in late October. He was safe and recovering at Sutter's Fort, but each day he became more concerned for the fate of his family and friends. He pleaded with Colonel [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] to gather a team of men to cross the pass and help the company. In return Reed promised to join Fr\u00e9mont's forces and fight in the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].<ref>Johnson, p. 193.</ref> He was joined by McCutchen, who had been unable to return with Stanton, as well as some members of the Harlan-Young party.

For example, Colonel Fr\u00e9mont's personnel were occupied at that precise time in capturing Santa Barbara. Throughout the region, roads were blocked, communications compromised, and supplies unavailable. Only three men responded to a call for volunteers to rescue the Donner Party. Reed was laid over in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] until February because of regional uprisings and general confusion. He spent that time speaking with other pioneers and acquaintances. The people of San Jose responded by creating a petition to appeal to the U.S. Navy to assist the people at Truckee Lake. Two local newspapers reported that members of the snowshoe party had resorted to cannibalism, which helped to foster sympathy for those who were still trapped. Residents of [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]], many of them recent migrants, raised $1,300 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1300|1847|r=-2}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}) and organized relief efforts to build two camps to supply a rescue party for the refugees.<ref>Stewart, pp. 150\u2013159.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 180\u2013181.</ref>\n\nA rescue party including William Eddy started on February 4 from the Sacramento Valley. Rain and a swollen river forced several delays. Eddy stationed himself at Bear Valley, while the others made steady progress through the snow and storms to cross the pass to Truckee Lake, caching their food at stations along the way so they did not have to carry it all. Three of the rescue party turned back, but seven forged on.<ref>Stewart, pp. 176\u2013189.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 166\u2013167.</ref>\n\nOn February 18, the seven-man rescue party scaled Fr\u00e9mont Pass (now Donner Pass); as they neared where Eddy told them the cabins would be, they began to shout. Mrs. Murphy appeared from a hole in the snow, stared at them and asked, \"Are you men from California, or do you come from heaven?\"<ref>Stewart, p. 191.</ref> The relief party doled out food in small portions, concerned that it might kill them if the emaciated migrants overate. All the cabins were buried in snow. Sodden oxhide roofs had begun to rot and the smell was overpowering. Thirteen people at the camps were dead, and their bodies had been loosely buried in snow near the cabin roofs. Some of the migrants seemed emotionally unstable. Three of the rescue party trekked to the Donners and brought back four gaunt children and three adults. Leanna Donner had particular difficulty walking up the steep incline from Alder Creek to Truckee Lake, later writing \"such pain and misery as I endured that day is beyond description\".<ref>Rarick, p. 173.</ref> George Donner's arm was so [[gangrene|gangrenous]] he could not move. Twenty-three people were chosen to go with the rescue party, leaving twenty-one in the cabins at Truckee Lake and twelve at Alder Creek.<ref>Stewart, pp. 190\u2013196.</ref><ref>Rarick, p. 170.</ref>\n\nThe rescuers concealed the fate of the snowshoe party, informing the rescued migrants only that they did not return because they were frostbitten.<ref>Rarick, p. 171.</ref> Patty and Tommy Reed were soon too weak to cross the snowdrifts, and no one was strong enough to carry them. Margret Reed faced the agonizing predicament of accompanying her two older children to Bear Valley and watching her two frailest be taken back to Truckee Lake without a parent. She made rescuer Aquilla Glover swear on his honor as a [[freemasonry|Mason]] that he would return for her children. Patty Reed told her, \"Well, mother, if you never see me again, do the best you can.\"<ref>Stewart, p. 198.</ref><ref>Rarick, p. 174.</ref> Upon their return to the lake, the Breens flatly refused them entry to their cabin but, after Glover left more food, the children were grudgingly admitted. The rescue party was dismayed to find that the first cache station had been broken into by animals, leaving them without food for four days. After struggling on the walk over the pass, John Denton slipped into a coma and died. Ada Keseberg died soon afterwards; her mother was inconsolable, refusing to let the child's body go. After several days' more travel through difficult country, the rescuers grew very concerned that the children would not survive. Some of them ate the buckskin fringe from one of the rescuer's pants, and the shoelaces of another, to the relief party's surprise. On their way down from the mountains, they met the next rescue party, which included James Reed. Upon hearing his voice, Margret sank into the snow, overwhelmed.<ref>Stewart, pp. 197\u2013203.</ref><ref>Rarick, p. 178.</ref>\n\nAfter these rescued migrants made it safely into Bear Valley, William Hook, Jacob Donner's stepson, broke into food stores and fatally gorged himself. The others continued to Sutter's Fort, where Virginia Reed wrote, \"I really thought I had stepped over into paradise\". She was amused to note one of the young men asked her to marry him, although she was only 12 years old and recovering from starvation,<ref>Stewart, pp. 204\u2013206.</ref><ref>Rarick, p. 187.</ref> but she turned him down.<ref>McGlashen, p. 239.</ref>\n\n===Second relief===\n{| class=\"wikitable infobox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em;;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Members rescued by second relief\n|-\n!

These rescuers included veteran [[Mountain man |mountain men]], most notably [[John Turner (fur trapper)|John Turner]],<ref>Stewart, p. 209</ref><ref>McGlashan, p. 161</ref> who accompanied the return of Reed and McCutchen. Reed was reunited with his daughter Patty and his weakened son Tommy. An inspection of the Breen cabin found its occupants relatively well, but the Murphy cabin, according to author George Stewart, \"passed the limits of description and almost of imagination\". Levinah Murphy was caring for her eight-year-old son Simon and the two young children of William Eddy and Foster. She had deteriorated mentally and was nearly blind. The children were listless and had not been cleaned in days. Lewis Keseberg had moved into the cabin and could barely move due to an injured leg.<ref>Stewart, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref>\n\nNo one at Truckee Lake had died during the interim between the departure of the first and the arrival of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body.<ref>Stewart, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref> The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg. When they made their presence known, he threw it into a hole in the snow that contained the mostly dismembered body of Jacob Donner. Inside the tent, Elizabeth Donner refused to eat, although her children were being nourished by their father's organs.<ref>Rarick, p. 191.</ref> The rescuers discovered three other bodies had already been consumed. In the other tent, Tamsen Donner was well, but George was very ill because the infection had reached his shoulder.<ref>Stewart, pp. 215\u2013219.</ref>\n\n[[File:Donner Lake and snow sheds2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Lake beside snowy mountains with railroad construction sheds in foreground|View of Truckee Lake from Donner Pass, taken in 1868 as the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] reached completion]]\n\nThe second relief evacuated 17 migrants from Truckee Lake, only three of whom were adults. Both the Breen and Graves families prepared to go. Only five people remained at Truckee Lake: Keseberg, Mrs. Murphy and her son Simon, and the young Eddy and Foster children. Tamsen Donner elected to stay with her ailing husband after Reed informed her that a third relief party would arrive soon. Mrs. Donner kept her daughters Eliza, Georgia, and Frances with her.<ref>Rarick, p. 195.</ref>\n\nThe walk back to Bear Valley was very slow. At one point, Reed sent two men ahead to retrieve the first cache of food, expecting the third relief, a small party led by [[Selim E. Woodworth]], to come at any moment. A violent blizzard arose after they scaled the pass. Five-year-old Isaac Donner froze to death, and Reed nearly died. Mary Donner's feet were badly burned because they were so frostbitten that she did not realize she was sleeping with them in the fire. When the storm passed, the Breen and Graves families were too apathetic and exhausted to get up and move, not having eaten for days. The relief party had no choice but to leave without them.<ref>Stewart, pp. 220\u2013230.</ref><ref>Reed, James \"The Snow Bound Starved Emigrants of 1846 Statement by Mr. Reed, One of the Donner Company\" (1871), in Johnson, p. 199.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 199\u2013203.</ref>\n\n<!---the following paragraph is nearly incomprehensible; it needs to be made more clear as to who did what to whom and when and why--->\nThree members of the relief party stayed, one at Truckee Lake and two at Alder Creek. When one, Nicholas Clark, went hunting, the other two, Charles Cady and Charles Stone, made plans to return to California. According to Stewart, Tamsen Donner arranged for them to carry three of her children to California, perhaps for $500 cash. Cady and Stone took the children to Truckee Lake but then left alone, overtaking Reed and the others within days.<ref>Stewart, pp. 231\u2013236.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 207\u2013208.</ref> Several days later, Clark and Trudeau agreed to leave together.

After one day, they met Reed helping his children, all frostbitten and bleeding but alive. Desperate to rescue their own children, Foster and Eddy persuaded four men, with pleading and money, to return to Truckee Lake with them. Eleven survivors were huddled around a fire that had sunk into a pit. The relief party split, with Foster, Eddy, and two others headed toward Truckee Lake. Two rescuers, hoping to save the healthiest, each took a child and left. John Stark refused to leave the others. He picked up two children and all the provisions and assisted the nine remaining Breens and Graves to Bear Valley.<ref>Stewart, pp. 237\u2013246.</ref><ref>King, pp. 92\u201393.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 214\u2013215.</ref>\n\n===Third relief===\n{| class=\"wikitable infobox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em;;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Members rescued by third relief\n|-\n!

Tamsen Donner had just arrived at the Murphy cabin.

Both turned back before getting to Bear Valley, and no further attempts were made. On April 10, almost a month since the third relief had left Truckee Lake, the ''[[alcalde]]'' near Sutter's Fort organized a salvage party to recover what they could of the Donners' belongings. These would be sold, with part of the proceeds used to support the orphaned Donner children. The salvage party found the Alder Creek tents empty except for the body of George Donner, who had died only days earlier. On their way back to Truckee Lake, they found Lewis Keseberg alive. According to him, Mrs. Murphy had died a week after the departure of the third relief. Some weeks later, Tamsen Donner had arrived at his cabin on her way over the pass, soaked and visibly upset. Keseberg said he put a blanket around her and told her to start out in the morning, but she died during the night.\n\nThe salvage party was suspicious of Keseberg's story and found a pot full of human flesh in the cabin along with George Donner's pistols, jewelry, and $250 in gold. The men threatened to lynch Keseberg, who confessed he had cached $273 of the Donners' money at Tamsen's suggestion, so that it could one day benefit her children.<ref>Stewart, pp. 258\u2013265.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 222\u2013226.</ref> On April 29, 1847, Keseberg was the last member of the Donner Party to arrive at Sutter's Fort.\n\n===Response===\n{{Quote box\n| width = 30em\n| quote = A more revolting or appalling spectacle I never witnessed.

Mary Graves married early, but her first husband was murdered. She cooked his killer's food while he was in prison to ensure the condemned man did not starve before his hanging.

He attempted to follow through on his promise to murder Lewis Keseberg but was dissuaded by James Reed and Edwin Bryant. A year later, Eddy recalled his experiences to J.

The court awarded him $1 in damages, but also made him pay court costs. An 1847 story printed in the ''California Star'' described Keseberg's actions in ghoulish terms and his near-lynching by the salvage party. It reported that he preferred eating human flesh over the cattle and horses that had become exposed in the spring thaw. Historian Charles McGlashan amassed enough material to indict Keseberg for the murder of Tamsen Donner, but after interviewing him he concluded no murder occurred. Eliza Donner Houghton also believed Keseberg to be innocent.<ref>King, p. 106.</ref>\n\nAs Keseberg grew older, he did not venture outside, for he had become a pariah and was often threatened.

The attention directed at the Donner Party is made possible by reliable accounts of what occurred, according to Stewart, and the fact that \"the cannibalism, although it might almost be called a minor episode, has become in the popular mind the chief fact to be remembered about the Donner Party. For a taboo always allures with as great strength as it repels\".<ref>Stewart, p. 295.</ref> The appeal is the events focused on families and ordinary people, according to Johnson, writing in 1996, instead of on rare individuals, and that the events are \"a dreadful irony that hopes of prosperity, health, and a new life in California's fertile valleys led many only to misery, hunger, and death on her stony threshold\".<ref>Johnson, p. 1.</ref>\n\nThe site of the cabins became a tourist attraction as early as 1854.<ref>State of California, p. 43.</ref> In the 1880s, Charles McGlashan began promoting the idea of a monument to mark the site of the Donner Party episode. He helped to acquire the land for a monument and, in June 1918, the statue of a pioneer family, dedicated to the Donner Party, was placed on the spot where the Breen-Keseberg cabin was thought to have stood.<ref name=rarick243and244>Rarick, pp. 243\u2013244.</ref> It was made a California Historical Landmark in 1934.<ref>State of California, p. 44.</ref>\n\nThe State of California created the [[Donner Memorial State Park]] in 1927. It originally consisted of {{convert|11|acre|km2}} surrounding the monument. Twenty years later, the site of the Murphy cabin was purchased and added to the park.<ref>State of California, p. 45.</ref> In 1962, the Emigrant Trail Museum was added to tell the history of westward migration into California. The Murphy cabin and Donner monument were established as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1963. A large rock served as the back-end of the fireplace of the Murphy cabin, and a bronze plaque has been affixed to the rock listing the members of the Donner Party, indicating who survived and who did not. The State of California justifies memorializing the site because the episode was \"an isolated and tragic incident of American history that has been transformed into a major folk epic\".<ref>State of California, p. 39.</ref> As of 2003, the park is estimated to receive 200,000 visitors a year.<ref>State of California, p. 59.</ref>\n\n===Mortality===\n\nMost historians count 87&nbsp;members of the party, although Stephen McCurdy in the ''[[Western Journal of Medicine]]'' includes Sarah Keyes\u2014Margret Reed's mother\u2014and Luis and Salvador, bringing the number to 90.<ref name=mccurdy/> Five people had already died before the party reached Truckee Lake: one from [[tuberculosis]] (Halloran), three from trauma (Snyder, Wolfinger, and Pike), and one from exposure (Hardkoop).

Several members became more susceptible to infection due to starvation,<ref name=hardesty114>Hardesty, p. 114.</ref> such as George Donner, but the three most significant factors in survival were age, sex, and the size of family group that each member traveled with. The survivors were on average 7.5&nbsp;years younger than those who died; children aged between six and 14 had a much higher survival rate than infants and children under the age of six, of whom 62.5 percent died, including the son born to the Kesebergs on the trail, or adults over the age of 35. No adults over the age of 49 survived. Deaths were \"extremely high\" among males aged between 20 and 39, at more than 66 percent.<ref name=GraysonAutumn1990/> Men have been found to metabolize protein faster, and women do not require as high a caloric intake. Women also store more body fat, which delays the effects of physical degradation caused by starvation and overwork. Men also tend to take on more dangerous tasks, and in this particular instance, the men were required to clear brush and engage in heavy labor before reaching Truckee Lake, adding to their physical debilitation. Those traveling with family members had a higher survival rate than bachelor males, possibly because family members more readily shared food with each other.<ref name=mccurdy>McCurdy, Stephen (1994).

Some correspondents were not forthcoming, approaching their participation with shame, but others eventually spoke about it freely. McGlashan in his 1879 book ''History of the Donner Party'' declined to include some of the more morbid details\u2014such as the suffering of the children and infants before death\u2014or how Mrs. Murphy, according to Georgia Donner, gave up, lay down on her bed and faced the wall when the last of the children left in the third relief. He also neglected to mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.<ref>Stewart, pp. 307\u2013313.</ref><ref>McGlashan, p. 161.</ref> The same year McGlashan's book was published, Georgia Donner wrote to him to clarify some points, saying that human flesh was prepared for people in both tents at Alder Creek, but to her recollection (she was four years old during the winter of 1846\u20131847) it was given only to the youngest children: \"Father was crying and did not look at us the entire time, and we little ones felt we could not help it. There was nothing else.\" She also remembered that Elizabeth Donner, Jacob's wife, announced one morning that she had cooked the arm of Samuel Shoemaker, a 25-year-old teamster.<ref>Stewart, p. 312.</ref> Eliza Donner Houghton, in her 1911 account of the ordeal, did not mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.\n\nArchaeological findings at the Alder Creek camp proved inconclusive for evidence of cannibalism. None of the bones tested at the Alder Creek cooking hearth could be identified with certainty as human.<ref>Dixon et al., 2010; Robbins Schug and Gray, 2011</ref> According to Rarick, only cooked bones would be preserved, and it is unlikely that the Donner Party members would have needed to cook human bones.<ref>Rarick, p. 193.</ref>\n\nEliza Farnham's 1856 account of the Donner Party was based largely on an interview with Margaret Breen. Her version details the ordeals of the Graves and Breen families after James Reed and the second relief left them in the snow pit. According to Farnham, seven-year-old Mary Donner suggested to the others that they should eat Isaac Donner, Franklin Graves Jr., and Elizabeth Graves, because the Donners had already begun eating the others at Alder Creek, including Mary's father Jacob. Margaret Breen insisted that she and her family did not cannibalize the dead, but Kristin Johnson, Ethan Rarick, and Joseph King\u2014whose account is sympathetic to the Breen family\u2014do not consider it credible that the Breens, who had been without food for nine days, would have been able to survive without eating human flesh. King suggests Farnham included this in her account independently of Margaret Breen.<ref>Farnham, Eliza, excerpt from ''California, In-doors and Out'' (1856), published in Johnson, pp. 139\u2013168.</ref><ref>Johnson, p. 164., Rarick, p. 213, King, pp. 86\u201387.</ref>\n\nAccording to an account published by H. A. Wise in 1847, Jean Baptiste Trudeau boasted of his own heroism, but also spoke in lurid detail of eating Jacob Donner, and said he had eaten a baby raw.<ref>Wise, H. A., excerpt from ''Los Gringos'' (1849), published in Johnson, pp. 134\u2013135.</ref> Many years later, Trudeau met Eliza Donner Houghton and denied cannibalizing anyone. He reiterated this in an interview with a St. Louis newspaper in 1891, when he was 60 years old. Houghton and the other Donner children were fond of Trudeau, and he of them, despite their circumstances and the fact that he eventually left Tamsen Donner alone. Author George Stewart considers Trudeau's accounting to Wise more accurate than what he told Houghton in 1884, and asserted that he deserted the Donners.<ref>Stewart, p. 297.</ref> Kristin Johnson, on the other hand, attributes Trudeau's interview with Wise to be a result of \"common adolescent desires to be the center of attention and to shock one's elders\"; when older, he reconsidered his story, so as not to upset Houghton.<ref>Johnson, p. 133.</ref> Historians Joseph King and Jack Steed call Stewart's characterization of Trudeau's actions as desertion \"extravagant moralism\", particularly because all members of the party were forced to make difficult choices.<ref>King, Joseph; Steed, Jack (Summer 1995). \"John Baptiste Trudeau of the Donner Party: Rascal or Hero?\", ''California History'' '''74''' (2) pp. 162\u2013173.</ref> Ethan Rarick echoed this by writing, \"more than the gleaming heroism or sullied villainy, the Donner Party is a story of hard decisions that were neither heroic nor villainous\".<ref>Rarick, p. 245.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Donner Party timeline]]\n*[[List of incidents of cannibalism]]\n*[[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|1972 Andes flight disaster]]\n*[[Alferd Packer]]\n\n==References==\n\n'''Footnotes'''\n{{reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist|16em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Bagley, Will (2010), ''So Rugged and So Mountainous: Blazing the Trails to Oregon and California, 1812\u20131848'', [[University of Oklahoma Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-8061-4103-9}}\n* Dixon, Kelly, Shannon Novak, Gwen Robbins, Julie Schablitsky, Richard Scott, and Guy Tasa (2010), \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20170811103950/https://www.unr.edu/Documents/liberal-arts/anthropology/Scott/Dixon%20et%20al.pdf Men, Women, and Children are Starving: Archaeology of the Donner Family Camp]\".

Delayed by a series of mishaps, they spent the winter of 1846\u201347 snowbound in the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range. Some of the migrants resorted to [[cannibalism]] to survive, eating the bodies of those who had succumbed to starvation and sickness.\n\nThe Donner Party departed [[Missouri]] on the [[Oregon Trail]] in the spring of 1846, behind many other pioneer families who were attempting to make the same overland trip. The journey west usually took between four and six months, but the Donner Party was slowed after electing to follow a new route called the [[Hastings Cutoff]], which bypassed established trails and instead crossed [[Utah]]'s [[Wasatch Mountains]] and the [[Great Salt Lake Desert]]. The desolate and rugged terrain, and the difficulties they later encountered while traveling along the [[Humboldt River]] in present-day [[Nevada]], resulted in the loss of many cattle and wagons, and divisions soon formed within the group.\n\nBy early November, the migrants had reached the Sierra Nevada but became trapped by an early, heavy snowfall near Truckee Lake (now [[Donner Lake]]) high in the mountains. Their food supplies ran dangerously low, and in mid-December some of the group set out on foot to obtain help. Rescuers from California attempted to reach the migrants, but the first relief party did not arrive until the middle of February 1847, almost four months after the wagon train became trapped. Of the 87 members of the party, 48 survived the ordeal. Historians have described the episode as one of the most spectacular tragedies in California history, and in the entire record of American westward migration.<ref>McGlashan, p. 16; Stewart, p. 271.</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Humboldt River Papa 2.jpg|thumb|An encampment of tents and covered wagons on the [[Humboldt River]] in Nevada, 1859]]<!-- needs [[WP:ALT]] -->\nDuring the 1840s, the United States saw a dramatic increase in settlers who left their homes in the east to resettle in the [[Oregon Territory]] or California, which at the time were only accessible by a very long sea voyage or a daunting overland journey across the American frontier. Some, such as Patrick Breen, saw California as a place where they would be free to live in a fully Catholic culture;<ref name=Enright1954>Enright, John Shea (December 1954). \"The Breens of San Juan Bautista: With a Calendar of Family Papers\", ''[[California Historical Society Quarterly]]'' '''33''' (4) pp. 349\u2013359.</ref> others were attracted to the West's burgeoning economic opportunities or inspired by the idea of [[manifest destiny]], the belief that the land between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans belonged to European Americans and that they should settle it.<ref>Rarick, p. 11.</ref> Most wagon trains followed the [[Oregon Trail]] route from a starting point in [[Independence, Missouri]], to the [[Continental Divide of the Americas]], traveling about {{convert|15|mi}} a day<ref name=rarick18and24and45>Rarick, pp. 18, 24, 45.</ref> on a journey that usually took between four and six months.<ref name=bagley130>Bagley, p. 130.</ref> The trail generally followed rivers to [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]], a [[mountain pass]] in present-day [[Wyoming]] which was relatively easy for wagons to negotiate.<ref name=rarick48>Rarick, p. 48.</ref> From there, pioneers had a choice of routes to their destinations.<ref name=rarick45>Rarick, p. 45.</ref>\n\n[[Lansford Hastings]], an early migrant from Ohio to the West, went to California in 1842 and saw the promise of the undeveloped country. To encourage settlers, he published ''The Emigrants' Guide to Oregon and California''.<ref name=rarick47/> As an alternative to the Oregon Trail's standard route through [[Idaho]]'s [[Snake River Plain]], he proposed a more direct route (which actually increased the trip's mileage) to California across the [[Great Basin]], which would take travelers through the [[Wasatch Range]] and across the [[Great Salt Lake Desert]].<ref name=rarick69/> Hastings had not traveled any part of his proposed shortcut until early 1846 on a trip from California to [[Fort Bridger]]. The fort was a scant supply station run by [[Jim Bridger]] and his partner [[Louis Vasquez]] in [[Blacks Fork]], Wyoming. Hastings stayed at the fort to persuade travelers to turn south on his route.<ref name=rarick47>Rarick, p. 47.</ref> As of 1846, Hastings was the second of two men documented to have crossed the southern part of the Great Salt Lake Desert, but neither had been accompanied by wagons.<ref name=rarick69/><ref group=upper-alpha>There are no written records of native tribes having crossed the desert, nor did the migrants mention any existing trails in this region.

He was accompanied by his wife Margret (32), step-daughter Virginia (13), daughter Martha Jane (\"Patty\", 8), sons James and Thomas (5 and 3), and Sarah Keyes, Margret Reed's 70-year-old mother, who was in the advanced stages of [[tuberculosis|consumption]] (tuberculosis)<ref>Johnson, p. 181.</ref> and died on May 28; she was buried by the side of the trail.<ref>Rarick, p. 23.</ref> In addition to leaving financial worries behind, Reed hoped that California's climate would help Margret, who had long suffered from ill health.<ref name=\"DixonP32\" /> The Reeds hired three men to drive the ox teams: Milford (\"Milt\") Elliott (28), James Smith (25), and Walter Herron (25).

They had been delayed by rain and a rising river, but Tamsen Donner wrote to a friend in Springfield, \"indeed, if I do not experience something far worse than I have yet done, I shall say the trouble is all in getting started\".<ref>Rarick, p. 30.</ref><ref group=upper-alpha>Tamsen Donner's letters were printed in the ''Springfield Journal'' in 1846.

Levinah Murphy (37), a widow from Tennessee, headed a family of thirteen. Her five youngest children were: John Landrum (16), Meriam (\"Mary\", 14), Lemuel (12), William (10), and Simon (8). Levinah's two married daughters and their families also came along: Sarah Murphy Foster (19), her husband William M. (30) and son Jeremiah George (1); Harriet Murphy Pike (18), her husband William M. (32) and their daughters Naomi (3) and Catherine (1). William H. Eddy (28), a carriage maker from Illinois, brought his wife Eleanor (25) and their two children, James (3) and Margaret (1). The Breen family consisted of Patrick Breen (51), a farmer from Iowa, his wife Margaret (\"Peggy\", 40), and seven children: John (14), Edward (13), Patrick, Jr. (9), Simon (8), James (5), Peter (3), and 11-month-old Isabelle.

On July 12, the Reeds and Donners were given one of them.<ref>Johnson, pp. 6\u20137.</ref> Hastings warned the migrants they could expect opposition from the Mexican authorities in California and advised them to band together in large groups. He also claimed to have \"worked out a new and better road to California\", and said he would be waiting at Fort Bridger to guide the migrants along the new cutoff.<ref name=Andrews1973>Andrews, Thomas F. (April 1973). \"Lansford W. Hastings and the Promotion of the Great Salt Lake Cutoff: A Reappraisal\", ''[[The Western Historical Quarterly]]'' '''4''' (2) pp. 133\u2013150.</ref>\n\n[[File:Donner route map.png|thumb|500px|right|Map of the route taken by the Donner Party, showing the [[Hastings Cutoff]]\u2014which added {{convert|150|mi|km}} to their travels\u2014in orange]]\nOn July 20, at the Little Sandy River, most of the wagon train opted to follow the established trail via [[Fort Hall]]. A smaller group opted to head for Fort Bridger and needed a leader. Most of the younger men in the group were European immigrants and not considered to be ideal leaders. James Reed had lived in the U.S. for a considerable time, was older, and had military experience, but his autocratic attitude had rubbed many in the party the wrong way, and they saw him as aristocratic, imperious, and ostentatious.<ref>Stewart, pp. 16\u201318.</ref> By comparison, the mature, experienced, American-born Donner's peaceful and charitable nature made him the group's first choice.<ref>Stewart, p. 14.</ref> The members of the party were comfortably well-off by contemporaneous standards.<ref name=rarick17/> Although they are called pioneers, most of the party lacked skills and experience for traveling through mountains and arid land. Additionally, the party had little knowledge about how to interact with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].<ref>Stewart, pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nJournalist [[Edwin Bryant (alcalde)|Edwin Bryant]] reached Blacks Fork a week ahead of the Donner Party. He saw the first part of the trail and was concerned that it would be difficult for the wagons in the Donner group, especially with so many women and children. He returned to Blacks Fork to leave letters warning several members of the group not to take Hastings' shortcut.<ref>Rarick, p. 56.</ref> By the time the Donner Party reached Blacks Fork on July 27, Hastings had already left, leading the forty wagons of the Harlan-Young group.<ref name=Andrews1973/> Because Jim Bridger's trading post would fare substantially better if people used the Hastings Cutoff, he told the party that the shortcut was a smooth trip, devoid of rugged country and hostile Native Americans, and would therefore shorten their journey by {{convert|350|mi|km}}. Water would be easy to find along the way, although a couple of days crossing a {{convert|30|\u2013|40|mi|km|adj=on}} dry lake bed would be necessary.\n\nReed was very impressed with this information and advocated for the Hastings Cutoff. None of the party received Bryant's letters warning them to avoid Hastings' route at all costs; in his diary account, Bryant states his conviction that Bridger deliberately concealed the letters, a view shared by Reed in his later testimony.<ref name=Andrews1973/><ref>Stewart, pp. 25\u201327; Rarick, p. 58.</ref> At Fort Laramie, Reed met an old friend named James Clyman who was coming from California. Clyman warned Reed not to take the Hastings Cutoff, telling him that wagons would not be able to make it and that Hastings' information was inaccurate.<ref>Rarick, p. 47.</ref> Fellow pioneer [[Jesse Quinn Thornton]] traveled part of the way with Donner and Reed, and in his book ''From Oregon and California in 1848'' declared Hastings the \"[[Baron Munchausen]] of travelers in these countries\".<ref>Johnson, p. 20</ref> Tamsen Donner, according to Thornton, was \"gloomy, sad, and dispirited\" at the thought of turning off the main trail on the advice of Hastings, whom she considered \"a selfish adventurer\".<ref>Johnson, p. 22.</ref>\n\nOn July 31, 1846, the party left Blacks Fork after four days of rest and wagon repairs, eleven days behind the leading Harlan-Young group. Donner hired a replacement driver, and the company was joined by the McCutcheon family, consisting of 30-year-old William, his 24-year-old wife Amanda, two-year-old daughter Harriet, and a 16-year-old named Jean Baptiste Trudeau from New Mexico, who claimed to have knowledge of the Native Americans and terrain on the way to California.<ref>Stewart, p. 28.</ref>\n\n===Wasatch Mountains===\n[[File:Big Cottonwood Canyon, Utah.JPG|thumb|Big Cottonwood Canyon, located several miles south of the Donner route in the heart of the Wasatch mountains of Northern Utah]]\n\nThe party turned south to follow the Hastings Cutoff. Within days, they found the terrain to be much more difficult than described. Drivers were forced to lock the wheels of their wagons to prevent them from rolling down steep inclines. Several years of traffic on the main Oregon Trail had left an easy and obvious path, whereas the Cutoff was more difficult to find. Hastings wrote directions and left letters stuck to trees. On August 6, the party found a letter from him advising them to stop until he could show them an alternate route to that taken by the Harlan-Young Party.<ref group=upper-alpha>While Hastings was otherwise occupied, his guides had led the Harlan-Young Party through [[Weber Canyon]], which was not the route that Hastings had intended to take. (Rarick, p. 61)</ref> Reed, Charles T. Stanton, and William Pike rode ahead to get Hastings. They encountered exceedingly difficult canyons where boulders had to be moved and walls cut off precariously to a river below, a route likely to break wagons. In his letter Hastings had offered to guide the Donner Party around the more difficult areas, but he rode back only part way, indicating the general direction to follow.<ref>Stewart, pp. 31\u201335.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 61\u201362.</ref>\n\nStanton and Pike stopped to rest, and Reed returned alone to the group, arriving four days after the party's departure. Without the guide they had been promised, the group had to decide whether to turn back and rejoin the traditional trail, follow the tracks left by the Harlan-Young Party through the difficult terrain of [[Weber Canyon]], or forge their own trail in the direction that Hastings had recommended. At Reed's urging, the group chose the new Hastings route.<ref>Rarick, pp. 64\u201365.</ref> Their progress slowed to about one and a half miles (2.4 km) a day. All able-bodied men were required to clear brush, fell trees, and heave rocks to make room for the wagons.<ref group=upper-alpha>The route that the party followed is now known as [[Emigration Canyon, Utah|Emigration Canyon]]. (Johnson, p. 28)</ref>\n\nAs the Donner Party made its way across the [[Wasatch Mountains]], the Graves family, who had set off to find them, reached them. They consisted of 57-year-old Franklin Ward Graves, his 47-year-old wife Elizabeth, their children Mary (20), William (18), Eleanor (15), Lovina (13), Nancy (9), Jonathan (7), Franklin, Jr. (5), Elizabeth (1), and married daughter Sarah (22), plus son-in-law Jay Fosdick (23), and a 25-year-old teamster named John Snyder, traveling together in three wagons. Their arrival brought the Donner Party to 87 members in 60\u201380 wagons.<ref>Rarick, pp. 67\u201368, Johnson, p. 25.</ref> The Graves family had been part of the last group to leave Missouri, confirming the Donner Party was at the back of the year's western exodus.<ref name=rarick68>Rarick, p. 68.</ref>\n\nIt was August 20 by the time that they reached a point in the mountains where they could look down and see the [[Great Salt Lake]]. It took almost another two weeks to travel out of the Wasatch Mountains. The men began arguing, and doubts were expressed about the wisdom of those who had chosen this route, in particular James Reed. Food and supplies began to run out for some of the less affluent families. Stanton and Pike had ridden out with Reed but had become lost on their way back; by the time that the party found them, they were a day away from eating their horses.<ref>Stewart, pp. 36\u201339.</ref>\n\n===Great Salt Lake Desert===\n[[File:Butte in Great Salt Lake Desert-750px.JPG|thumb|left|alt=Flat expanse with a mountain range in the distance|[[Great Salt Lake Desert]]]]\n\nLuke Halloran died of [[tuberculosis]] on August 25. A few days later, the party came across a torn and tattered letter from Hastings. The pieces indicated there were two days and nights of difficult travel ahead without grass or water. The party rested their oxen and prepared for the trip.<ref name=rarick70and71>Rarick, pp. 70\u201371.</ref> After 36&nbsp;hours they set off to traverse a {{convert|1000|ft|m|adj=on}} mountain that lay in their path. From its peak, they saw ahead of them a dry, barren plain, perfectly flat and covered with white salt, larger than the one they had just crossed,<ref name=stewart40to44/> and \"one of the most inhospitable places on earth\" according to Rarick.<ref name=rarick69>Rarick, p. 69.</ref> Their oxen were already fatigued, and their water was nearly gone.<ref name=stewart40to44>Stewart, pp. 40\u201344.</ref>\n\nThe party pressed onward on August 30, having no alternative. In the heat of the day, the moisture underneath the salt crust rose to the surface and turned it into a gummy mass. The wagon wheels sank into it, in some cases up to the hubs. The days were blisteringly hot and the nights frigid. Several of the group saw visions of lakes and wagon trains and believed they had finally overtaken Hastings. After three days, the water was gone, and some of the party removed their oxen from the wagons to press ahead to find more. Some of the animals were so weakened they were left yoked to the wagons and abandoned. Nine of Reed's ten oxen broke free, crazed with thirst, and bolted off into the desert. Many other families' cattle and horses had also gone missing. The rigors of the journey resulted in irreparable damage to some of the wagons, but no human lives had been lost. Instead of the promised two-day journey over {{convert|40|mi}}, the journey across the {{convert|80|mi}} of [[Great Salt Lake Desert]] had taken six.<ref>Stewart, pp. 44\u201350.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 72\u201374.</ref><ref group=upper-alpha>In 1986, a team of archaeologists attempted to cross the same stretch of desert at the same time of year in four-wheel drive trucks and were unable to do so. (Rarick, p. 71)</ref>\n\nNone of the party had any remaining faith in the Hastings Cutoff as they recovered at the springs on the other side of the desert.<ref group=upper-alpha>The location has since been named Donner Spring where the Donner Party recuperated, at the base of [[Pilot Peak (Nevada)|Pilot Peak]]. (Johnson, p. 31)</ref> They spent several days trying to recover cattle, retrieve the wagons left in the desert, and transfer their food and supplies to other wagons.<ref group=upper-alpha>Reed's account states that many of the travelers lost cattle and were trying to locate them, although some of the other members thought that they were looking for his cattle. (Rarick, p. 74, Reed's own account \"The Snow-Bound, Starved Emigrants of 1846 Statement by Mr. Reed, One of the Donner Company\" in Johnson, p. 190)</ref> Reed's family incurred the heaviest losses, and Reed became more assertive, asking all the families to submit an inventory of their goods and food to him. He suggested that two men should go to [[Sutter's Fort]] in California; he had heard that [[John Sutter]] was exceedingly generous to wayward pioneers and could assist them with extra provisions. Charles Stanton and William McCutchen volunteered to undertake the dangerous trip.<ref>Rarick, pp. 75\u201376.</ref> The remaining serviceable wagons were pulled by mongrel teams of cows, oxen, and mules. It was the middle of September, and two young men who went in search of missing oxen reported that another {{convert|40|mi}} of [[Lahontan Valley|desert]] lay ahead.<ref name=stewart50to53>Stewart, pp. 50\u201353.</ref>\n\nTheir cattle and oxen were now exhausted and lean, but the Donner Party crossed the next stretch of desert relatively unscathed. The journey seemed to get easier, particularly through the valley next to the [[Ruby Mountains]]. Despite their near hatred of Hastings, they had no choice but to follow his tracks, which were weeks old. On September 26, two months after embarking on the cutoff, the Donner Party rejoined the traditional trail along a stream that became known as the [[Humboldt River]]. The shortcut had probably delayed them by a month.<ref name=\"Stewart, pp. 54\u201358\">Stewart, pp. 54\u201358.</ref><ref name=rarick80and81>Rarick, pp. 78\u201381.</ref>\n\n==Rejoining the trail==\n\n===Reed banished===\n\nAlong the Humboldt, the group met [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] Native Americans, who joined them for a couple of days but stole or shot several oxen and horses. By now, it was well into October, and the Donner families split off to make better time. Two wagons in the remaining group became tangled, and John Snyder angrily beat the ox of Reed's hired teamster Milt Elliott. When Reed intervened, Snyder turned the whip on him. Reed retaliated by fatally plunging a knife under Snyder's collarbone.<ref name=\"Stewart, pp. 54\u201358\"/><ref name=rarick80and81 />\n\nThat evening, the witnesses gathered to discuss what was to be done. United States laws were not applicable west of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] (in what was then Mexican territory) and wagon trains often dispensed their own justice.<ref>Rarick, p. 82.</ref> But George Donner, the party's leader, was a full day ahead of the main wagon train with his family.<ref>McNeese, p. 72.</ref> Snyder had been seen to hit James Reed, and some claimed he had also hit Margret Reed,<ref>Rarick, p. 83.</ref> but Snyder had been popular and Reed was not.

With grass in short supply, the cattle spread out more, which allowed the Paiutes to steal 18 more during one evening; several mornings later, they shot another 21.<ref>Rarick, p. 95.</ref> So far, the company had lost nearly 100 oxen and cattle, and their rations were almost completely depleted. With nearly all his cattle gone, Wolfinger stopped at the [[Humboldt Sink]] to cache (bury) his wagon; Reinhardt and Spitzer stayed behind to help.

The Eddys' oxen had been killed by Native Americans and they were forced to abandon their wagon. The family had eaten all their stores, but the other families refused to assist their children.

Margret Reed and her children were also now without a wagon.<ref name=rarick98>Rarick, p. 98.</ref><ref name=stewart67to74/> But the desert soon came to an end, and the party found the [[Truckee River]] in beautiful lush country.<ref name=stewart67to74>Stewart, pp. 67\u201374.</ref>\n\nThey had little time to rest. The company pressed on to cross the Sierra Nevada before the snows came. Stanton, one of the two men who had left a month earlier to seek assistance in California, found the company; and he brought mules, food, and two [[Miwok]] Native Americans named Luis and Salvador.<ref group=upper-alpha>The branch of [[Miwoks]] from the California plains region were the Cosumne, between where Stockton and Sacramento are located. Luis and Salvador, both Consumne, were Catholic converts employed by John Sutter. Historian Joseph King deduced that Luis' given Miwok name was Eema. He was probably 19 years old in 1846. Salvador's given name was probably Qu\u00e9Yuen, and he would have been 28 years old the same year. (King, Joseph A.

Both the pass and the lake are now called Donner.]]\n\nFaced with one last push over mountains that were described as much worse than the Wasatch, the ragtag company had to decide whether to forge ahead or rest their cattle. It was October 20 and they had been told the pass would not be snowed in until the middle of November. William Pike was killed when a gun being loaded by William Foster was discharged negligently,<ref>Johnson, p. 43.</ref> an event that seemed to make the decision for them; family by family, they resumed their journey, first the Breens, then the Kesebergs, Stanton with the Reeds, Graves, and the Murphys. The Donners waited and traveled last. After a few miles of rough terrain, an axle broke on one of their wagons. Jacob and George went into the woods to fashion a replacement. George Donner sliced his hand open while chiseling the wood but it seemed a superficial wound.<ref>Stewart, pp. 81\u201383.</ref>\n\nSnow began to fall. The Breens made it up the \"massive, nearly vertical slope\" {{convert|1000|ft|m}} to Truckee Lake (now known as [[Donner Lake]]), {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the summit, and camped near a cabin that had been built two years earlier by another group of pioneers.<ref>Rarick, p. 108.</ref><ref group=upper-alpha>The cabins were built by three members of another group of migrants known as the Stevens Party, specifically by Joseph Foster, Allen Stevens, and Moses Schallenberger in November 1844.

Over the next few days, several more attempts were made to breach the pass with their wagons and animals, but all efforts failed.{{-}}\n\n===Winter camp===\n[[File:Map of Truckee Lake and Alder Creek.svg|thumb|right|350 px|Map showing the Truckee Lake and Alder Creek sites]]\n\nSixty members and associates of the Breen, Graves, Reed, Murphy, Keseberg, and Eddy families set up for the winter at Truckee Lake. Three widely separated cabins of pine logs served as their homes, with dirt floors and poorly constructed flat roofs that leaked when it rained. The Breens occupied one cabin, the Eddys and the Murphys another, and the Reeds and the Graves the third. Keseberg built a [[lean-to]] for his family against the side of the Breen cabin. The families used canvas or oxhide to patch the faulty roofs. The cabins had no windows or doors, only large holes to allow entry. Of the 60 at Truckee Lake, 19 were men over 18, 12 were women, and 29 were children, six of whom were toddlers or younger. Farther down the trail, close to Alder Creek, the Donner families hastily constructed tents to house 21 people, including Mrs. Wolfinger, her child, and the Donners' drivers: six men, three women, and twelve children in all.<ref>Stewart, pp. 105\u2013107.</ref><ref>Hardesty, p. 60.</ref> It began to snow again on the evening of November 4\u2014the beginning of a storm that lasted eight days.<ref>Stewart, pp. 84\u201387.</ref>\n\nBy the time the party made camp, very little food remained from the supplies that Stanton had brought back from Sutter's Fort. The oxen began to die, and their carcasses were frozen and stacked. Truckee Lake was not yet frozen, but the pioneers were unfamiliar with catching lake trout. Eddy, the most experienced hunter, killed a bear, but had little luck after that. The Reed and Eddy families had lost almost everything. Margret Reed promised to pay double when they got to California for the use of three oxen from the Graves and Breen families. Graves charged Eddy $25\u2014normally the cost of two healthy oxen\u2014for the carcass of an ox that had starved to death.<ref>Stewart, pp. 108\u2013109.</ref><ref>Johnson, p. 44.</ref>\n\nDesperation grew in camp and some reasoned that individuals might succeed in navigating the pass where the wagons could not. On November 12, the storm abated, and a small party tried to reach the summit on foot but found the trek through the soft, deep powder too difficult, and returned that same evening. Over the next week, two more attempts were made by other small parties, but both quickly failed. On November 21, a large party of about 22 persons successfully reached the peak. The party traveled about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} west of the summit, but this trip too was aborted, and they returned to the lake on November 23.\n\n[[File:Truckee Lake camp.jpg|thumb|left|Artist's rendering of the Truckee Lake camp based on descriptions by William Graves<ref group=upper-alpha>This drawing is inaccurate in several respects: the cabins were spread so far apart that Patrick Breen in his diary came to call inhabitants of other cabins \"strangers\" whose visits were rare.

It also neglects to include the snow that met the migrants from the day they arrived.</ref>|alt=Three log cabins with flat roofs set in the midst of tall trees, with mountains in the background.

He concerned himself primarily with the weather, marking the storms and how much snow had fallen, but gradually began to include references to God and religion in his entries.<ref>Rarick, p. 145.</ref> Life at Truckee Lake was miserable. The cabins were cramped and filthy, and it snowed so much that people were unable to go outdoors for days. Diets soon consisted of oxhide, strips of which were boiled to make a \"disagreeable\" glue-like jelly. Ox and horse bones were boiled repeatedly to make soup, and they became so brittle that they would crumble upon chewing. Sometimes they were softened by being charred and eaten. Bit by bit, the Murphy children picked apart the oxhide rug that lay in front of their fireplace, roasted it in the fire, and ate it.<ref>McGlashan, p. 90.</ref> After the departure of the snowshoe party, two-thirds of the migrants at Truckee Lake were children. Mrs. Graves was in charge of eight, and Levinah Murphy and Eleanor Eddy together took care of nine.<ref>Rarick, p. 146.</ref> Migrants caught and ate mice that strayed into their cabins. Many of the people at Truckee Lake were soon weakened and spent most of their time in bed. Occasionally one would be able to make the full-day trek to see the Donners. News came that Jacob Donner and three hired men had died. One of them, Joseph Reinhardt, confessed on his deathbed that he had murdered Wolfinger.<ref>Johnson, p. 40. See also McGlashan letter from Leanna Donner, 1879.</ref> George Donner's hand had become infected, which left four men to work at the Donner camp.<ref>Stewart, pp. 160\u2013167.</ref>\n\nMargret Reed had managed to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, to the delight of her children, but by January they were facing starvation and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning that it would be better to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graves came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.<ref>Stewart, pp. 168\u2013175.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 148\u2013150.</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===\"The Forlorn Hope\"===\n{| class=\"wikitable infobox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em;;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Members of \"The Forlorn Hope\"\n|-\n!

Spitzer died, then Baylis Williams (a driver for the Reeds) also died, more from malnutrition than starvation. Franklin Graves fashioned 14 pairs of [[snowshoe]]s out of [[oxbow]]s and hide. A party of 17 men, women, and children set out on foot in an attempt to cross the mountain pass.<ref>McGlashan pp. 66\u201367.</ref> As evidence of how grim their choices were, four of the men were fathers. Three of the women, who were mothers, gave their young children to other women.

The members of the party were neither well-nourished nor accustomed to camping in snow {{convert|12|ft|m}} deep and, by the third day, most were [[Snow blindness|snowblind]]. On the sixth day, Eddy discovered his wife had hidden a half-pound of bear meat in his pack. The group set out again the morning of December 21; Stanton had been straggling for several days, and he remained behind, saying he would follow shortly.

After two more days without food, Patrick Dolan proposed one of them should volunteer to die in order to feed the others. Some suggested a duel, while another account describes an attempt to create a lottery to choose a member to sacrifice.<ref name=rarick136/><ref>Thornton, J. Quinn, excerpt from ''Oregon and California in 1848'' (1849), published in Johnson, p. 52.</ref> Eddy suggested that they keep moving until someone simply fell, but a blizzard forced the group to halt.

He returned shortly afterwards and died a few hours later. Not long after, possibly because Murphy was near death, some of the group began to eat flesh from Dolan's body. Lemuel's sister tried to feed some to her brother, but he died shortly afterwards. Eddy, Salvador, and Luis refused to eat. The next morning, the group stripped the muscle and organs from the bodies of Antonio, Dolan, Graves, and Murphy. They dried them to store for the days ahead, taking care to ensure nobody would have to eat his or her relatives.<ref>Stewart, pp. 131\u2013133.</ref><ref>Thornton, J.

Eddy eventually succumbed to his hunger and ate human flesh, but that was soon gone. They began taking apart their snowshoes to eat the oxhide webbing and discussed killing Luis and Salvador for food, before Eddy warned the two men and they quietly left.<ref>Thornton, J.

For example, Colonel Fr\u00e9mont's personnel were occupied at that precise time in capturing Santa Barbara. Throughout the region, roads were blocked, communications compromised, and supplies unavailable. Only three men responded to a call for volunteers to rescue the Donner Party. Reed was laid over in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] until February because of regional uprisings and general confusion. He spent that time speaking with other pioneers and acquaintances. The people of San Jose responded by creating a petition to appeal to the U.S. Navy to assist the people at Truckee Lake. Two local newspapers reported that members of the snowshoe party had resorted to cannibalism, which helped to foster sympathy for those who were still trapped. Residents of [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]], many of them recent migrants, raised $1,300 (${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|1300|1847|r=-2}}}} in {{inflation-year|US}}) and organized relief efforts to build two camps to supply a rescue party for the refugees.<ref>Stewart, pp. 150\u2013159.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 180\u2013181.</ref>\n\nA rescue party including William Eddy started on February 4 from the Sacramento Valley. Rain and a swollen river forced several delays. Eddy stationed himself at Bear Valley, while the others made steady progress through the snow and storms to cross the pass to Truckee Lake, caching their food at stations along the way so they did not have to carry it all. Three of the rescue party turned back, but seven forged on.<ref>Stewart, pp. 176\u2013189.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 166\u2013167.</ref>\n\nOn February 18, the seven-man rescue party scaled Fr\u00e9mont Pass (now Donner Pass); as they neared where Eddy told them the cabins would be, they began to shout. Mrs. Murphy appeared from a hole in the snow, stared at them and asked, \"Are you men from California, or do you come from heaven?\"<ref>Stewart, p. 191.</ref> The relief party doled out food in small portions, concerned that it might kill them if the emaciated migrants overate. All the cabins were buried in snow. Sodden oxhide roofs had begun to rot and the smell was overpowering. Thirteen people at the camps were dead, and their bodies had been loosely buried in snow near the cabin roofs. Some of the migrants seemed emotionally unstable. Three of the rescue party trekked to the Donners and brought back four gaunt children and three adults. Leanna Donner had particular difficulty walking up the steep incline from Alder Creek to Truckee Lake, later writing \"such pain and misery as I endured that day is beyond description\".<ref>Rarick, p. 173.</ref> George Donner's arm was so [[gangrene|gangrenous]] he could not move.

Margret Reed faced the agonizing predicament of accompanying her two older children to Bear Valley and watching her two frailest be taken back to Truckee Lake without a parent. She made rescuer Aquilla Glover swear on his honor as a [[freemasonry|Mason]] that he would return for her children. Patty Reed told her, \"Well, mother, if you never see me again, do the best you can.\"<ref>Stewart, p. 198.</ref><ref>Rarick, p. 174.</ref> Upon their return to the lake, the Breens flatly refused them entry to their cabin but, after Glover left more food, the children were grudgingly admitted. The rescue party was dismayed to find that the first cache station had been broken into by animals, leaving them without food for four days. After struggling on the walk over the pass, John Denton slipped into a coma and died. Ada Keseberg died soon afterwards; her mother was inconsolable, refusing to let the child's body go. After several days' more travel through difficult country, the rescuers grew very concerned that the children would not survive. Some of them ate the buckskin fringe from one of the rescuer's pants, and the shoelaces of another, to the relief party's surprise. On their way down from the mountains, they met the next rescue party, which included James Reed. Upon hearing his voice, Margret sank into the snow, overwhelmed.<ref>Stewart, pp. 197\u2013203.</ref><ref>Rarick, p. 178.</ref>\n\nAfter these rescued migrants made it safely into Bear Valley, William Hook, Jacob Donner's stepson, broke into food stores and fatally gorged himself. The others continued to Sutter's Fort, where Virginia Reed wrote, \"I really thought I had stepped over into paradise\". She was amused to note one of the young men asked her to marry him, although she was only 12 years old and recovering from starvation,<ref>Stewart, pp. 204\u2013206.</ref><ref>Rarick, p. 187.</ref> but she turned him down.<ref>McGlashen, p. 239.</ref>\n\n===Second relief===\n{| class=\"wikitable infobox collapsible collapsed\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 90%; margin: 0 0 0.5em 1em;;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" | Members rescued by second relief\n|-\n!

Reed was reunited with his daughter Patty and his weakened son Tommy. An inspection of the Breen cabin found its occupants relatively well, but the Murphy cabin, according to author George Stewart, \"passed the limits of description and almost of imagination\". Levinah Murphy was caring for her eight-year-old son Simon and the two young children of William Eddy and Foster. She had deteriorated mentally and was nearly blind. The children were listless and had not been cleaned in days. Lewis Keseberg had moved into the cabin and could barely move due to an injured leg.<ref>Stewart, pp. 211\u2013212.</ref>\n\nNo one at Truckee Lake had died during the interim between the departure of the first and the arrival of the second relief party. Patrick Breen documented a disturbing visit in the last week of February from Mrs. Murphy, who said her family was considering eating Milt Elliott. Reed and McCutchen found Elliott's mutilated body.<ref>Stewart, pp. 213\u2013214.</ref> The Alder Creek camp fared no better. The first two members of the relief party to reach it saw Trudeau carrying a human leg.

Both the Breen and Graves families prepared to go. Only five people remained at Truckee Lake: Keseberg, Mrs. Murphy and her son Simon, and the young Eddy and Foster children. Tamsen Donner elected to stay with her ailing husband after Reed informed her that a third relief party would arrive soon. Mrs. Donner kept her daughters Eliza, Georgia, and Frances with her.<ref>Rarick, p. 195.</ref>\n\nThe walk back to Bear Valley was very slow. At one point, Reed sent two men ahead to retrieve the first cache of food, expecting the third relief, a small party led by [[Selim E. Woodworth]], to come at any moment. A violent blizzard arose after they scaled the pass. Five-year-old Isaac Donner froze to death, and Reed nearly died. Mary Donner's feet were badly burned because they were so frostbitten that she did not realize she was sleeping with them in the fire. When the storm passed, the Breen and Graves families were too apathetic and exhausted to get up and move, not having eaten for days.

When one, Nicholas Clark, went hunting, the other two, Charles Cady and Charles Stone, made plans to return to California. According to Stewart, Tamsen Donner arranged for them to carry three of her children to California, perhaps for $500 cash.

Eleven survivors were huddled around a fire that had sunk into a pit. The relief party split, with Foster, Eddy, and two others headed toward Truckee Lake.

Both turned back before getting to Bear Valley, and no further attempts were made. On April 10, almost a month since the third relief had left Truckee Lake, the ''[[alcalde]]'' near Sutter's Fort organized a salvage party to recover what they could of the Donners' belongings. These would be sold, with part of the proceeds used to support the orphaned Donner children. The salvage party found the Alder Creek tents empty except for the body of George Donner, who had died only days earlier. On their way back to Truckee Lake, they found Lewis Keseberg alive. According to him, Mrs. Murphy had died a week after the departure of the third relief. Some weeks later, Tamsen Donner had arrived at his cabin on her way over the pass, soaked and visibly upset. Keseberg said he put a blanket around her and told her to start out in the morning, but she died during the night.\n\nThe salvage party was suspicious of Keseberg's story and found a pot full of human flesh in the cabin along with George Donner's pistols, jewelry, and $250 in gold. The men threatened to lynch Keseberg, who confessed he had cached $273 of the Donners' money at Tamsen's suggestion, so that it could one day benefit her children.<ref>Stewart, pp. 258\u2013265.</ref><ref>Rarick, pp. 222\u2013226.</ref> On April 29, 1847, Keseberg was the last member of the Donner Party to arrive at Sutter's Fort.\n\n===Response===\n{{Quote box\n| width = 30em\n| quote = A more revolting or appalling spectacle I never witnessed.

The court awarded him $1 in damages, but also made him pay court costs. An 1847 story printed in the ''California Star'' described Keseberg's actions in ghoulish terms and his near-lynching by the salvage party. It reported that he preferred eating human flesh over the cattle and horses that had become exposed in the spring thaw.

The attention directed at the Donner Party is made possible by reliable accounts of what occurred, according to Stewart, and the fact that \"the cannibalism, although it might almost be called a minor episode, has become in the popular mind the chief fact to be remembered about the Donner Party. For a taboo always allures with as great strength as it repels\".<ref>Stewart, p. 295.</ref> The appeal is the events focused on families and ordinary people, according to Johnson, writing in 1996, instead of on rare individuals, and that the events are \"a dreadful irony that hopes of prosperity, health, and a new life in California's fertile valleys led many only to misery, hunger, and death on her stony threshold\".<ref>Johnson, p. 1.</ref>\n\nThe site of the cabins became a tourist attraction as early as 1854.<ref>State of California, p. 43.</ref> In the 1880s, Charles McGlashan began promoting the idea of a monument to mark the site of the Donner Party episode. He helped to acquire the land for a monument and, in June 1918, the statue of a pioneer family, dedicated to the Donner Party, was placed on the spot where the Breen-Keseberg cabin was thought to have stood.<ref name=rarick243and244>Rarick, pp. 243\u2013244.</ref> It was made a California Historical Landmark in 1934.<ref>State of California, p. 44.</ref>\n\nThe State of California created the [[Donner Memorial State Park]] in 1927.

Twenty years later, the site of the Murphy cabin was purchased and added to the park.<ref>State of California, p. 45.</ref> In 1962, the Emigrant Trail Museum was added to tell the history of westward migration into California. The Murphy cabin and Donner monument were established as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1963. A large rock served as the back-end of the fireplace of the Murphy cabin, and a bronze plaque has been affixed to the rock listing the members of the Donner Party, indicating who survived and who did not.

Several members became more susceptible to infection due to starvation,<ref name=hardesty114>Hardesty, p. 114.</ref> such as George Donner, but the three most significant factors in survival were age, sex, and the size of family group that each member traveled with. The survivors were on average 7.5&nbsp;years younger than those who died; children aged between six and 14 had a much higher survival rate than infants and children under the age of six, of whom 62.5 percent died, including the son born to the Kesebergs on the trail, or adults over the age of 35. No adults over the age of 49 survived. Deaths were \"extremely high\" among males aged between 20 and 39, at more than 66 percent.<ref name=GraysonAutumn1990/> Men have been found to metabolize protein faster, and women do not require as high a caloric intake. Women also store more body fat, which delays the effects of physical degradation caused by starvation and overwork. Men also tend to take on more dangerous tasks, and in this particular instance, the men were required to clear brush and engage in heavy labor before reaching Truckee Lake, adding to their physical debilitation. Those traveling with family members had a higher survival rate than bachelor males, possibly because family members more readily shared food with each other.<ref name=mccurdy>McCurdy, Stephen (1994).

Some correspondents were not forthcoming, approaching their participation with shame, but others eventually spoke about it freely. McGlashan in his 1879 book ''History of the Donner Party'' declined to include some of the more morbid details\u2014such as the suffering of the children and infants before death\u2014or how Mrs. Murphy, according to Georgia Donner, gave up, lay down on her bed and faced the wall when the last of the children left in the third relief.

There was nothing else.\" She also remembered that Elizabeth Donner, Jacob's wife, announced one morning that she had cooked the arm of Samuel Shoemaker, a 25-year-old teamster.<ref>Stewart, p. 312.</ref> Eliza Donner Houghton, in her 1911 account of the ordeal, did not mention any cannibalism at Alder Creek.\n\nArchaeological findings at the Alder Creek camp proved inconclusive for evidence of cannibalism. None of the bones tested at the Alder Creek cooking hearth could be identified with certainty as human.<ref>Dixon et al., 2010; Robbins Schug and Gray, 2011</ref> According to Rarick, only cooked bones would be preserved, and it is unlikely that the Donner Party members would have needed to cook human bones.<ref>Rarick, p. 193.</ref>\n\nEliza Farnham's 1856 account of the Donner Party was based largely on an interview with Margaret Breen. Her version details the ordeals of the Graves and Breen families after James Reed and the second relief left them in the snow pit. According to Farnham, seven-year-old Mary Donner suggested to the others that they should eat Isaac Donner, Franklin Graves Jr., and Elizabeth Graves, because the Donners had already begun eating the others at Alder Creek, including Mary's father Jacob. Margaret Breen insisted that she and her family did not cannibalize the dead, but Kristin Johnson, Ethan Rarick, and Joseph King\u2014whose account is sympathetic to the Breen family\u2014do not consider it credible that the Breens, who had been without food for nine days, would have been able to survive without eating human flesh. King suggests Farnham included this in her account independently of Margaret Breen.<ref>Farnham, Eliza, excerpt from ''California, In-doors and Out'' (1856), published in Johnson, pp. 139\u2013168.</ref><ref>Johnson, p. 164., Rarick, p. 213, King, pp. 86\u201387.</ref>\n\nAccording to an account published by H.

He reiterated this in an interview with a St. Louis newspaper in 1891, when he was 60 years old. Houghton and the other Donner children were fond of Trudeau, and he of them, despite their circumstances and the fact that he eventually left Tamsen Donner alone. Author George Stewart considers Trudeau's accounting to Wise more accurate than what he told Houghton in 1884, and asserted that he deserted the Donners.<ref>Stewart, p. 297.</ref> Kristin Johnson, on the other hand, attributes Trudeau's interview with Wise to be a result of \"common adolescent desires to be the center of attention and to shock one's elders\"; when older, he reconsidered his story, so as not to upset Houghton.<ref>Johnson, p. 133.</ref> Historians Joseph King and Jack Steed call Stewart's characterization of Trudeau's actions as desertion \"extravagant moralism\", particularly because all members of the party were forced to make difficult choices.<ref>King, Joseph; Steed, Jack (Summer 1995). \"John Baptiste Trudeau of the Donner Party: Rascal or Hero?\", ''California History'' '''74''' (2) pp. 162\u2013173.</ref> Ethan Rarick echoed this by writing, \"more than the gleaming heroism or sullied villainy, the Donner Party is a story of hard decisions that were neither heroic nor villainous\".<ref>Rarick, p. 245.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n\n*[[Donner Party timeline]]\n*[[List of incidents of cannibalism]]\n*[[Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571|1972 Andes flight disaster]]\n*[[Alferd Packer]]\n\n==References==\n\n'''Footnotes'''\n{{reflist|group=upper-alpha}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist|16em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* Bagley, Will (2010), ''So Rugged and So Mountainous: Blazing the Trails to Oregon and California, 1812\u20131848'', [[University of Oklahoma Press]], {{ISBN|978-0-8061-4103-9}}\n* Dixon, Kelly, Shannon Novak, Gwen Robbins, Julie Schablitsky, Richard Scott, and Guy Tasa (2010), \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20170811103950/https://www.unr.edu/Documents/liberal-arts/anthropology/Scott/Dixon%20et%20al.pdf Men, Women, and Children are Starving: Archaeology of the Donner Family Camp]\".

The rise of the Igala mega state disrupted and contributed to the shift of the [[Trans-Atlantic slave trade]] from the Bight of Benin the decline of the [[Benin]] Empire between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Idah-Benin war (1515\u20131516) was a war of mutual independence. The Igala state reached its political and commercial supremacy afterwards, when it became a leading exporter of choral beads, horses, medicine, skills and of course, slaves to the coastal region. Its growing power, nevertheless, changed the dynamics of the earlier complex relationships with several northern [[Ibo people|Ibo]] communities. Joseph Hawkins in 1797 already captured the relentless raiding of the extreme northern [[Iboland]] by the Igalas. In his ''A History of a Voyage to the Coast of Africa'' he noted the growing conflicts between the \"Ebo Country\" and \"Galla\". By the late 17th century, the Igalas conquered and held socio-economic, political and religious control of the northern Ibo mini-states. From [[Opi (archaeological site)]], [[Nsukka]], Nsugbe, several Ibo communities on the [[Anambra River]], the lower Niger, through Okpanam to Asaba the Igala held sway. Trading out post with Onitsha and the Ijo middlemen were fully established. The mythical Omeppa, Inenyi Ogugu set up garrison at [[Opi (archaeological site)]] and several Igala warlords played their part in the buildup of the Igala colonial take over of these northern [[Ibo people|Ibo]] states. But no other individual played a greater role in shaping Igala-Ibo colonisation during the 18th century than Onoja Oboni, the legendary Igala warrior and slave trader. Onoja Oboni's personality and heritage has been shrouded in mythical imagery over time. Ranging from being the Son of Eri, the grandson of Aganapoje to being a descendant of one of the Idah royal families; the priestly sub-clan of Obajeadaka in Okete-ochai-attah. The key areas of consensus are; he was a master strategist, slave raider and trader, conqueror, coloniser and imperialist. Added to these were his diplomacy, expansionist traits and the acculturation of conquered territories. He built himself a walled city in Ogurugu and recent archaeological findings of the remnant of the ruins of his fort on the grounds of the [[University of Nigeria Nsukka]] confirm this. The Igala soldiers built forts and fortifications that stretched from Ete down to [[Opi (archaeological site)]] and then to Anambra. Oboni's rise to power affected the history of the North-western Nsukka and the Ibo communities on the [[Anambra River]] and the Lower Niger during the Igala commercial and socio-cultural ascendancy and domination. This was the reinforcing of the golden age of Igala imperial expansion. In this way, Igala mega state took control and allegiance were paid. Until the decline of Igala power, the Ezes of [[Enugu-Ezike]], Akpugo, Nkpologu, Ibagwa Ani and Opi continued to receive their titles from Idah; investiture, installation and confirmation of their office was only by the royal blessing of Attah Igala in Idah. The [[Eze]] were only validated when they returned home with Igala choral beads ''aka'', staff of office believed to be imbued with protective charms to ensure longevity and security of the Eze as well as prestige animal (horse) to bolster up their ego. There were also periodic royal visits to the Attah Igala to pay tributes and as well intended to strengthen diplomatic ties and inter-group relations, renew allegiance, and assured insurance from slave raids. In terms of indigenous technologies, the Igala soldiers built factories (forges) for manufacturing Dane-guns, ironworks, carving, introduced arrowheads with tip-poison from sting ray; cloth knitting, terracing of [[Nsukka]] hillsides and brought in a well developed political and social hierarchies. At this time Igala empire had become a cultural exchange hub for other emerging states; the influence was felt as far north as the Nok civilisation and down east to [[Ibo-Ukwu]] civilisation. Till date many of the Igala-Nsukka borderland remain bilingual. On the religious level, the Igala installed their own priests- the Attama- as the custodian of the dangerous [[Alusi]], shrine, took control as mediators between the spirit and the Ibo communities, presided over divinations and fashioned ''Ikenga'', ''Okwute'' (ritual staffs) that combined both Igala and Ibo religious elements. The Attama thus became the major agents of Igala socio-cultural control. Several efforts to keep the Attama lineage Igala failed, eventually the priestly office has been ibonized, even though the nominal Igala identification is still predominant. Many of the northern Ibo state settlements have lineages with Igala names, cultural practices with marked Igala modification and adaptations. The use of Igala circular basket in contrast to the Ibo rectangular types persists till this day. By the turn of the 19th century, the Igala empire was too large for any reliable and robust central control. Internal decay and implosion set in. The Fulani Crusaders  started contracting the Igala imperial power, conquered territories in the north switched tributes, forced or/and seceded from the Igala empire. The Bassa war added more pressure to the war-weary empire. The abolition of slave trade brought in untold economic recession. In 1914 the British burnt down Ibagwa and Obukpa as a punitive measure. By the 1920s, Igala empire was a spent force and a limping shadow, the British easily took over control of both Nsukka and the Igala territories.\n\nThe kingdom of Igala survived well into the 19th century, becoming a British protectorate in 1901.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Igala people]]\n*[[Idah]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |author=Isichei, Elizabeth. |title=A history of African Societies to 1870 |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofafrican00isic |url-access=registration |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-45599-5}}\n\n{{Nigerian traditional states}}\n\n[[Category:Former countries in Africa]]\n[[Category:Nigerian traditional states]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{cleanup|reason=Caps lock and style. |date=December 2018}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2018}}\n}}\n\nThe '''[[Igala Kingdom]]''', also known as the '''''[[Kingdom of Idah]]'', ''An\u1eb9-\u00ccg\u00e0l\u00e1''','' is a pre-colonial West African state, north central [[Nigeria]].

The rise of the Igala mega state disrupted and contributed to the shift of the [[Trans-Atlantic slave trade]] from the Bight of Benin the decline of the [[Benin]] Empire between the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. The Idah-Benin war (1515\u20131516) was a war of mutual independence. The Igala state reached its political and commercial supremacy afterwards, when it became a leading exporter of choral beads, horses, medicine, skills and of course, slaves to the coastal region. Its growing power, nevertheless, changed the dynamics of the earlier complex relationships with several northern [[Ibo people|Ibo]] communities. Joseph Hawkins in 1797 already captured the relentless raiding of the extreme northern [[Iboland]] by the Igalas. In his ''A History of a Voyage to the Coast of Africa'' he noted the growing conflicts between the \"Ebo Country\" and \"Galla\". By the late 17th century, the Igalas conquered and held socio-economic, political and religious control of the northern Ibo mini-states. From [[Opi (archaeological site)]], [[Nsukka]], Nsugbe, several Ibo communities on the [[Anambra River]], the lower Niger, through Okpanam to Asaba the Igala held sway. Trading out post with Onitsha and the Ijo middlemen were fully established. The mythical Omeppa, Inenyi Ogugu set up garrison at [[Opi (archaeological site)]] and several Igala warlords played their part in the buildup of the Igala colonial take over of these northern [[Ibo people|Ibo]] states. But no other individual played a greater role in shaping Igala-Ibo colonisation during the 18th century than Onoja Oboni, the legendary Igala warrior and slave trader. Onoja Oboni's personality and heritage has been shrouded in mythical imagery over time. Ranging from being the Son of Eri, the grandson of Aganapoje to being a descendant of one of the Idah royal families; the priestly sub-clan of Obajeadaka in Okete-ochai-attah. The key areas of consensus are; he was a master strategist, slave raider and trader, conqueror, coloniser and imperialist. Added to these were his diplomacy, expansionist traits and the acculturation of conquered territories. He built himself a walled city in Ogurugu and recent archaeological findings of the remnant of the ruins of his fort on the grounds of the [[University of Nigeria Nsukka]] confirm this. The Igala soldiers built forts and fortifications that stretched from Ete down to [[Opi (archaeological site)]] and then to Anambra. Oboni's rise to power affected the history of the North-western Nsukka and the Ibo communities on the [[Anambra River]] and the Lower Niger during the Igala commercial and socio-cultural ascendancy and domination. This was the reinforcing of the golden age of Igala imperial expansion. In this way, Igala mega state took control and allegiance were paid. Until the decline of Igala power, the Ezes of [[Enugu-Ezike]], Akpugo, Nkpologu, Ibagwa Ani and Opi continued to receive their titles from Idah; investiture, installation and confirmation of their office was only by the royal blessing of Attah Igala in Idah. The [[Eze]] were only validated when they returned home with Igala choral beads ''aka'', staff of office believed to be imbued with protective charms to ensure longevity and security of the Eze as well as prestige animal (horse) to bolster up their ego. There were also periodic royal visits to the Attah Igala to pay tributes and as well intended to strengthen diplomatic ties and inter-group relations, renew allegiance, and assured insurance from slave raids. In terms of indigenous technologies, the Igala soldiers built factories (forges) for manufacturing Dane-guns, ironworks, carving, introduced arrowheads with tip-poison from sting ray; cloth knitting, terracing of [[Nsukka]] hillsides and brought in a well developed political and social hierarchies. At this time Igala empire had become a cultural exchange hub for other emerging states; the influence was felt as far north as the Nok civilisation and down east to [[Ibo-Ukwu]] civilisation. Till date many of the Igala-Nsukka borderland remain bilingual. On the religious level, the Igala installed their own priests- the Attama- as the custodian of the dangerous [[Alusi]], shrine, took control as mediators between the spirit and the Ibo communities, presided over divinations and fashioned ''Ikenga'', ''Okwute'' (ritual staffs) that combined both Igala and Ibo religious elements. The Attama thus became the major agents of Igala socio-cultural control. Several efforts to keep the Attama lineage Igala failed, eventually the priestly office has been ibonized, even though the nominal Igala identification is still predominant. Many of the northern Ibo state settlements have lineages with Igala names, cultural practices with marked Igala modification and adaptations. The use of Igala circular basket in contrast to the Ibo rectangular types persists till this day. By the turn of the 19th century, the Igala empire was too large for any reliable and robust central control. Internal decay and implosion set in. The Fulani Crusaders  started contracting the Igala imperial power, conquered territories in the north switched tributes, forced or/and seceded from the Igala empire. The Bassa war added more pressure to the war-weary empire. The abolition of slave trade brought in untold economic recession. In 1914 the British burnt down Ibagwa and Obukpa as a punitive measure. By the 1920s, Igala empire was a spent force and a limping shadow, the British easily took over control of both Nsukka and the Igala territories.\n\nThe kingdom of Igala survived well into the 19th century, becoming a British protectorate in 1901.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Igala people]]\n*[[Idah]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |author=Isichei, Elizabeth. |title=A history of African Societies to 1870 |url=https://archive.org/details/historyofafrican00isic |url-access=registration |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-45599-5}}\n\n{{Nigerian traditional states}}\n\n[[Category:Former countries in Africa]]\n[[Category:Nigerian traditional states]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toBassa(link changed toBassa, Kogi State) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Igala_Kingdom"}
