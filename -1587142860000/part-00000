It was co-written by Bowie and [[Brian Eno]], produced by Bowie and [[Tony Visconti]], and recorded in July and August 1977 at [[Hansa Tonstudio|Hansa Studio by the Wall]]. It was released on 23 September 1977 as the lead single from his [[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|12th studio album of the same name]], backed with the song \"[[V-2 Schneider]]\". A product of Bowie's [[Berlin Trilogy|\"Berlin\" period]], the track was not a huge hit in the United Kingdom or United States after its release, but it has since become one of his [[signature song]]s. In January 2016, following Bowie's death, the song reached a new peak of number 12 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. {{\"'}}Heroes{{'\"}} has been cited as Bowie's second-most covered song after \"[[Rebel Rebel]]\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000).
