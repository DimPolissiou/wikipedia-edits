While there is no scientifically accepted definition of the term \"breed\",<ref>The state of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. Barbara Rischkowsky and Dafydd Pilling. [[Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]]. 2007</ref> a breed is generally defined as having distinct true-breeding characteristics over a number of generations. Its members may be called \"[[purebred]]\".  In most cases, bloodlines of [[horse breed]]s are recorded with a [[breed registry]]. The concept is somewhat flexible in horses, as [[open stud book]]s are created for developing horse breeds that are not yet fully true-breeding.\n\nRegistries also are considered the authority as to whether a given breed is listed as a \"horse\" or a \"pony\".  There are also a number of \"[[color breed]]\", [[sport horse]], and [[ambling|gaited horse]] registries for horses with various [[phenotype]]s or other traits, which admit any animal fitting a given set of physical characteristics, even if there is little or no evidence of the trait being a true-breeding characteristic.  Other recording entities or specialty organizations may recognize horses from multiple breeds, thus, for the purposes of this article, such animals are classified as a \"type\" rather than a \"breed\".\n\nThe breeds and types listed here are those that already have a Wikipedia article. For a more extensive list, see the [[List of all horse breeds in DAD-IS]].\n\nFor additional information, see [[horse breed]], [[horse breeding]], and the individual articles listed below.

Color is either the only criterion for registration or the primary criterion.  These are called \"[[color breed]]s,\" because unlike \"true\" horse breeds, there are few other physical requirements, nor is the [[stud book]] limited in any fashion.  As a general rule, the color also does not always breed on (in some cases due to genetic impossibility), and offspring without the stated color are usually not eligible for recording with the color breed registry.  There are breeds that have color that usually breeds \"true\" as well as distinctive physical characteristics and a limited stud book.  These horses are true breeds that have a preferred color, not color breeds, and include the [[Friesian horse]], the [[Cleveland Bay]], the [[Appaloosa]], and the [[American Paint Horse]].\n\nThe best-known \"color breed\" registries that accept horses from many different breeds are for the following colors:\n* [[Buckskin (horse)]], a color which cannot breed \"true\" due to the [[cream gene]] which creates it being an [[incomplete dominant]]\n* [[Palomino]], a color which cannot breed \"true\" due to the [[cream gene]] which creates it being an [[incomplete dominant]]\n* [[Pinto horse]]\n* [[White (horse)]].  Some of these animals are registered in the United States with the [[American creme and white horse registry]], which was once called an \"Albino\" registry until it was understood that true [[albino]] does not exist in horses.  (''see [[White (horse)]] and [[Dominant white]] for details'')\n\n== Types of horse ==\n{{see also|Category:Types of horse}}\nA \"type\" of horse is not a breed but is used here to categorize groups of horses or horse breeds that are similar in appearance ([[phenotype]]) or use.  A type usually has no [[breed registry]], and often encompasses several breeds. However, in some nations, particularly in Europe, there is a recording method or means of [[studbook selection]] for certain types to allow them to be licensed for breeding. Horses of a given type may be registered as one of several different recognized breeds, or a grouping may include horses that are of no particular [[Pedigree (animal)|pedigree]] but meet a certain standard of appearance or use.  \n<!--section only intended for types often mistaken for breeds, or for groupings that include several breeds-->\n<!--Please keep list alphabetized when editing-->\n\n=== Modern types ===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[AQPS]] (\"Autre Que Pur-Sang\"), French designation for riding horses \"other than Thoroughbred,\" usually referring to the [[Anglo-Arabian]], [[Selle Fran\u00e7ais]] and other Thoroughbred crosses.

While there is no scientifically accepted definition of the term \"breed\",<ref>The state of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. Barbara Rischkowsky and Dafydd Pilling. [[Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]]. 2007</ref> a breed is generally defined as having distinct true-breeding characteristics over a number of generations. Its members may be called \"[[purebred]]\".  In most cases, bloodlines of [[horse breed]]s are recorded with a [[breed registry]]. The concept is somewhat flexible in horses, as [[open stud book]]s are created for developing horse breeds that are not yet fully true-breeding.\n\nRegistries also are considered the authority as to whether a given breed is listed as a \"horse\" or a \"pony\".  There are also a number of \"[[color breed]]\", [[sport horse]], and [[ambling|gaited horse]] registries for horses with various [[phenotype]]s or other traits, which admit any animal fitting a given set of physical characteristics, even if there is little or no evidence of the trait being a true-breeding characteristic.  Other recording entities or specialty organizations may recognize horses from multiple breeds, thus, for the purposes of this article, such animals are classified as a \"type\" rather than a \"breed\".\n\nThe breeds and types listed here are those that already have a Wikipedia article. For a more extensive list, see the [[List of all horse breeds in DAD-IS]].\n\nFor additional information, see [[horse breed]], [[horse breeding]], and the individual articles listed below.

Color is either the only criterion for registration or the primary criterion.  These are called \"[[color breed]]s,\" because unlike \"true\" horse breeds, there are few other physical requirements, nor is the [[stud book]] limited in any fashion.  As a general rule, the color also does not always breed on (in some cases due to genetic impossibility), and offspring without the stated color are usually not eligible for recording with the color breed registry.  There are breeds that have color that usually breeds \"true\" as well as distinctive physical characteristics and a limited stud book.  These horses are true breeds that have a preferred color, not color breeds, and include the [[Friesian horse]], the [[Cleveland Bay]], the [[Appaloosa]], and the [[American Paint Horse]].\n\nThe best-known \"color breed\" registries that accept horses from many different breeds are for the following colors:\n* [[Buckskin (horse)]], a color which cannot breed \"true\" due to the [[cream gene]] which creates it being an [[incomplete dominant]]\n* [[Palomino]], a color which cannot breed \"true\" due to the [[cream gene]] which creates it being an [[incomplete dominant]]\n* [[Pinto horse]]\n* [[White (horse)]].  Some of these animals are registered in the United States with the [[American creme and white horse registry]], which was once called an \"Albino\" registry until it was understood that true [[albino]] does not exist in horses.  (''see [[White (horse)]] and [[Dominant white]] for details'')\n\n== Types of horse ==\n{{see also|Category:Types of horse}}\nA \"type\" of horse is not a breed but is used here to categorize groups of horses or horse breeds that are similar in appearance ([[phenotype]]) or use.  A type usually has no [[breed registry]], and often encompasses several breeds. However, in some nations, particularly in Europe, there is a recording method or means of [[studbook selection]] for certain types to allow them to be licensed for breeding. Horses of a given type may be registered as one of several different recognized breeds, or a grouping may include horses that are of no particular [[Pedigree (animal)|pedigree]] but meet a certain standard of appearance or use.  \n<!--section only intended for types often mistaken for breeds, or for groupings that include several breeds-->\n<!--Please keep list alphabetized when editing-->\n\n=== Modern types ===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[AQPS]] (\"Autre Que Pur-Sang\"), French designation for riding horses \"other than Thoroughbred,\" usually referring to the [[Anglo-Arabian]], [[Selle Fran\u00e7ais]] and other Thoroughbred crosses.

Thus, many terms for [[Horses in the Middle Ages]] did not refer to breeds as we know them today, but rather described appearance or purpose.  These terms included:\n\n*Charger, ''see'' [[Courser (horse)]]\n*[[Courser (horse)]]\n*[[Destrier]] ''or'' \"Great Horse\"\n*Hobby, ''see'' [[Irish Hobby]]\n*[[Jennet]], sometimes called Spanish Jennet\n*[[Palfrey]]\n*[[Rouncey]]\n*[[Steppe horse]], refers to various [[domesticated horse]] and [[wild horse]] species, particularly those from [[Siberia]] and other parts of western Asia\n\n== Extinct subspecies and breeds ==\nThese members of ''equus ferus'' either were a recognized, distinct breed of horse that no longer exists as such, or subspecies that have become [[Extinction|extinct]] at some point since [[domestication of the horse]].

One classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes, labeled the \"[[Tarpan]]\", \"[[History of horse domestication theories|Forest horse]]\", [[Draft horse|Draft]] and [[Oriental horse|\"Oriental\"]], each of which was hypothesized to have adapted to their environment prior to domestication.<ref name=\"Bennett7\">Bennett, ''Conquerors'', p.7</ref> However, more recent studies suggest that all domesticated horses originated from a single wild species and that the different body types of horses were entirely a result of [[selective breeding]] after domestication,<ref>Edwards, G. ''The Arabian,'' pp 1, 3</ref> or possibly [[landrace]] adaptation.\n\n=== Extinct breeds ===\nThese were human-developed breeds which no longer exist.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=20em|\n* [[Abaco Barb]]\n* [[Anglo-Norman horse]]\n* [[Angevin horse]]\n* [[Berrichon horse]]\n* [[Bidet horse]]\n* Cape Horse, see [[Boerperd]]\n* Chapman horse, see [[Cleveland Bay]], into which it developed\n* [[Charentais horse]], or Vend\u00e9en\n* [[Charolais horse]]\n* [[Cheval du Morvan]]\n* [[Ferghana horse]]\n* [[Galloway pony]]\n* [[Karacabey horse]]\n* [[Irish Hobby]]\n* [[Jennet]], or Spanish Jennet\n* [[Mazury horse]]\n* [[Narragansett Pacer]]\n* [[Navarrin horse]]\n* [[Neapolitan horse]]\n* [[Nisean horse]]\n* [[Norfolk Trotter]], ''also called'' the Norfolk Roadster, Yorkshire Trotter or Yorkshire Roadster\n* [[\u00d6land horse]]\n* [[Old English Black]] horse\n* [[Pozan]]\n* [[Turkoman Horse]] ''also known as'' Turkemene.

Do not place a period at the end of the entry. Names are reported under the date of death. Names under each date are reported in alphabetical order by surname or pseudonym.\n\n(1) Please add only those meeting Wikipedia notability guidelines. Include a reference to a reliable source.[a] [b] If a Wikipedia article for the dead does not yet exist, reconsider whether the subject is actually notable. If so, consider writing an article yourself. Those without a Wikipedia article are removed after one month.\n\n(2) Please understand that the intent of this article is to report notable deaths. Tragic deaths, while unfortunate, do not necessarily render the dead \"notable\". If you report the death of a notable subject that does not already have a Wikipedia article, consider starting one. Include third-party sources other than the obituary.\n\n(3) Please add entries in alphabetical order by family name. Please avoid over-linking. As such, please do not add links to nationalities, common occupations, or common causes of death. Rather, include only \"links that aid navigation and understanding\". Thank you.\n\n(4) References should be in <ref>[url & title]</ref> format, as full citations make the page too slow to load, and too big to edit.\n\n--Notes--\n[a] See [[WP:RS]] for definition of
