Furthermore, because national dishes are so interwoven into a nation's sense of identity, strong emotions and conflicts can arise when trying to choose a country's national dish.\n\n==Latin American dishes==\nIn [[Latin America]], dishes may be claimed or designated as a [https://www.linguee.com/spanish-english/translation/plato+nacional.html \"''plato nacional''\"], although in many cases, recipes transcend national borders with only minor variations.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Both [[Peru]] and [[Ecuador]] claim ''[[ceviche]]'' as their national dish. Stews of [[meat]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], and [[root vegetable]]s are the ''platos nacionales'' of several countries in [[Central America]], [[South America]], and the [[Caribbean]]: Colombian ''[[ajiaco]]'', as well as the ''[[sancocho]]'' of the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Colombia]], and [[Panama]], are examples of platos nacionales. Janer (2008) observes that this sharing of the same ''plato nacional'' by different countries calls into question the idea that every country has a unique national dish that is special to that country; she states that cuisine does not respect national and geopolitical borders.<ref name=Janer2008 />\n\nThe identification of Latin American national dishes is stronger among expatriate communities in North America.<ref name=Janer2008 /> In Latin American countries, the ''plato nacional''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spanishdict.com/translate/el%20plato%20nacional|title=plato nacional|last=online|first=testing|date=12 December 1990|website=spanishdict|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> is usually part of the cuisine of rural and peasant communities, and not necessarily part of the everyday cuisine of city dwellers. In expatriate communities, the dish is strongly reclaimed in order to retain the sense of national identity and ties to one's homeland, and is proudly served in homes and restaurants. By this show of national identity, the community can resist social pressures that push for homogenization of many ethnically and culturally diverse communities into a single all-encompassing group identity, such as [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]] or [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic American]].<ref name=Janer2008 />\n\n==By country==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2020}}\nThis is not a definitive list of national dishes, but rather a list of some foods that have been suggested to be national dishes.\n\n===A===\n* '''{{flag|Afghanistan}}''': [[Kabuli Palaw]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tastedefined.com/2009/11/kabuli-pulao-with-raisins-and-carrots.html|title=Kabuli Pulao With Raisins And Carrots|accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref>\n* '''{{flag|Albania}}''': [[Tav\u00eb kosi]]\n* '''{{flag|Algeria}}''': [[Couscous]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foodbycountry.com/Algeria-to-France/Algeria.html|title=Food in Algeria: Algerian Food, Algerian Cuisine|accessdate=15 August 2011}}</ref> [[chakhchoukha]]\n* '''{{flag|Andorra}}''': [[Escudella i carn d'olla|Escudella]]\n* '''{{flag|Angola}}''': [[Muamba de galinha]]<ref>Hamilton, Cherie.

An alcoholic national drink is sometimes a [[List of national liquors|national liquor]] drank straight/neat (as in the case of whiskey in Ireland), but is most often a mixed drink (e.g., caipirinhas in Brazil and pisco sours in Peru and Chile), or beer or wine.

It originally aired on June 13, 2000.<ref name=yahoo/> This episode features the youngest son of the [[Griffin family]], [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], as he develops romantic feelings for Janet, a female infant at a daycare. [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] begins working as a [[stewardess]], but soon wishes to quit; [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] convinces her to keep working because he gets to fly anywhere for free. Stewie realizes that Janet only played with him because he shared his cookies with her. Peter inadvertently flies in the same plane that Lois is working on; while they are arguing about his actions the plane is [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] to [[Cuba]]. Lois and Peter return to the United States via a refugee raft.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]] and [[Matt Weitzman]] and directed by Bert Ring. The episode received a positive review from Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]] for its storyline and use of Stewie. The episode features guest performances by [[Tara Charendoff]], [[Mo Collins]], [[Camryn Manheim]], and [[Haley Joel Osment]]. This episode marks the first appearance of the \"[[Evil Monkey]]\" character.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lois Griffin]] is concerned that her and Peter's intelligent infant son, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], is not getting along with other children at the park; so she and Peter decide to put him in a [[daycare]] so he can be around children his own age. With Stewie out of the house, Lois begins to feel rather bored, so her [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], suggests she get a part-time job to add some excitement to her life.\n\nWhen Peter tells his friends about Lois wanting to get a job, [[Glen Quagmire|Quagmire]] offers to get Lois a job as a [[flight attendant]] at the airport he works at, explaining that flight attendants get to travel to all kinds of exotic places and that relatives of flight attendants (including [[spouse]]s) can fly anywhere in the world for free, which inspires Peter to encourage Lois to work as a flight attendant. Since Lois is unaware of this, Peter visits many different locations without telling her. Dealing with obnoxious co-workers and passengers, Lois ends up hating the job and wants to quit but Peter tells her not to give up so soon so he can continue to reap the benefits of her hard work. Peter's fun eventually comes to an end when he and Lois end up on the same flight, and a furious Lois finds out what he had been up to, dragging him into the plane's bathroom to argue with him for using her. While they are occupied, the plane is [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] to [[Cuba]]. Unable to get documents to return to the US, they ride a refugee raft back home.\n\nMeanwhile, at the daycare, Stewie meets a female infant named Janet (voiced by [[Tara Strong|Tara Charendoff]]). For reasons that Stewie does not comprehend, he cannot stop thinking about her and Brian explains that he is in love with her. At first Stewie denies his feelings for Janet, but he soon becomes aware of his interest for her after he gives her the cookie that he brings daily as lunch; and he starts playing with her. Janet starts eating cookies with another infant of the daycare, after witnessing this Stewie feels betrayed and tries to make her jealous with another infant but is unsuccessful. At the end, Janet tells Stewie she likes him and asks if she could eat his cookie. Stewie is heartbroken when he figures out that she only wanted his cookies.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|200px|alt=A man with a bald head and a brown sweater, and a man with spiked brown hair and glasses, speaking into a microphone.|Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman wrote the episode.]]\nThe episode was written by series regulars [[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]] and [[Matt Weitzman]] and directed by Bert Ring, before the conclusion of the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second production season]].<ref name=yahoo/> [[Peter Shin]] and [[Pete Michels]] acted as supervising directors for the episode.

It originally aired on June 13, 2000.<ref name=yahoo/> This episode features the youngest son of the [[Griffin family]], [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], as he develops romantic feelings for Janet, a female infant at a daycare. [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] begins working as a [[stewardess]], but soon wishes to quit; [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] convinces her to keep working because he gets to fly anywhere for free. Stewie realizes that Janet only played with him because he shared his cookies with her. Peter inadvertently flies in the same plane that Lois is working on; while they are arguing about his actions the plane is [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] to [[Cuba]]. Lois and Peter return to the United States via a refugee raft.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]] and [[Matt Weitzman]] and directed by Bert Ring. The episode received a positive review from Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]] for its storyline and use of Stewie. The episode features guest performances by [[Tara Charendoff]], [[Mo Collins]], [[Camryn Manheim]], and [[Haley Joel Osment]]. This episode marks the first appearance of the \"[[Evil Monkey]]\" character.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lois Griffin]] is concerned that her and Peter's intelligent infant son, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], is not getting along with other children at the park; so she and Peter decide to put him in a [[daycare]] so he can be around children his own age. With Stewie out of the house, Lois begins to feel rather bored, so her [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], suggests she get a part-time job to add some excitement to her life.\n\nWhen Peter tells his friends about Lois wanting to get a job, [[Glen Quagmire|Quagmire]] offers to get Lois a job as a [[flight attendant]] at the airport he works at, explaining that flight attendants get to travel to all kinds of exotic places and that relatives of flight attendants (including [[spouse]]s) can fly anywhere in the world for free, which inspires Peter to encourage Lois to work as a flight attendant. Since Lois is unaware of this, Peter visits many different locations without telling her. Dealing with obnoxious co-workers and passengers, Lois ends up hating the job and wants to quit but Peter tells her not to give up so soon so he can continue to reap the benefits of her hard work. Peter's fun eventually comes to an end when he and Lois end up on the same flight, and a furious Lois finds out what he had been up to, dragging him into the plane's bathroom to argue with him for using her. While they are occupied, the plane is [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] to [[Cuba]]. Unable to get documents to return to the US, they ride a refugee raft back home.\n\nMeanwhile, at the daycare, Stewie meets a female infant named Janet (voiced by [[Tara Strong|Tara Charendoff]]). For reasons that Stewie does not comprehend, he cannot stop thinking about her and Brian explains that he is in love with her. At first Stewie denies his feelings for Janet, but he soon becomes aware of his interest for her after he gives her the cookie that he brings daily as lunch; and he starts playing with her. Janet starts eating cookies with another infant of the daycare, after witnessing this Stewie feels betrayed and tries to make her jealous with another infant but is unsuccessful. At the end, Janet tells Stewie she likes him and asks if she could eat his cookie. Stewie is heartbroken when he figures out that she only wanted his cookies.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|thumb|200px|alt=A man with a bald head and a brown sweater, and a man with spiked brown hair and glasses, speaking into a microphone.|Mike Barker and Matt Weitzman wrote the episode.]]\nThe episode was written by series regulars [[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]] and [[Matt Weitzman]] and directed by Bert Ring, before the conclusion of the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second production season]].<ref name=yahoo/> [[Peter Shin]] and [[Pete Michels]] acted as supervising directors for the episode.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on October 3, 2010. The episode features [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], an adamant [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], confronting [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] radio talk show host [[Rush Limbaugh]] at a book signing in [[Quahog, RI|Quahog]], and ultimately having a political change of heart when Limbaugh convinces him to read his latest book. Brian soon decides to become a devoted member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and soon begins criticizing liberals. This leads Brian to become roommates with Limbaugh, and begins following him everywhere; Limbaugh eventually gets annoyed with Brian and ends up disclosing his true political convictions.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Patrick Meighan (writer)|Patrick Meighan]] and directed by [[John Holmquist]]. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references, in addition to receiving both praise and criticism from conservative news outlets. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 7.94 million homes in its original airing. As well as Limbaugh, the episode featured guest performances by [[Gary Cole]], [[Christine Lakin]], [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Shelley Long]], [[Nana Visitor]] and [[Rainn Wilson]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \"Excellence in Broadcasting\" was released on [[DVD]] along with three other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nIn light of \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\", the Griffins are watching the news \u2014 where [[List of Family Guy characters#Tom Tucker|Tom Tucker]] reveals that [[Diane Simmons (Family Guy)|Diane Simmons]] committed the murders at [[James Woods]]' mansion and is now dead. He then introduces Diane's successor, [[Joyce Kinney]]. As [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] reads the newspaper, she discovers that conservative radio talk show host [[Rush Limbaugh]] is holding a book signing in [[Quahog, RI|Quahog]]. This enrages [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], who despises Limbaugh over his political beliefs and decides to confront him at the signing. There, Limbaugh is criticized by Brian, but he counters by asking him whether he has read any of his books, leaving Brian dumbfounded and angry. As he curses Limbaugh to himself on his way home, Brian is mugged by a gang; Limbaugh abruptly shows up and beats them all to rescue Brian. Thankful, Brian agrees to read four pages of Limbaugh's book. This he does, but Brian grows interested enough to continue reading the book overnight. By then, he becomes a conservative Republican. Lois questions Brian's conviction, citing his past liberalism, while Brian defends his ability to change his mind based on new information. Lois also mentions that Brian goes out of his way to not agree with the general consensus on many things (for example, he hated ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' but defends the movie ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]''), and accuses him of being a \"[[contrarian]]\" rather than a genuine believer. Brian meets with Limbaugh to thank him for helping his political conversion, and the two travel to the Republican National Headquarters, where they are greeted by former President of the United States [[George W. Bush]] and United States Senator [[John McCain]].\n\nReturning home, Lois is unimpressed when Brian tells her that Limbaugh will be coming over for dinner. That night, Lois begins arguing and challenging Limbaugh politically \u2014 with [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] joining in as well. She then accuses Limbaugh of [[brainwashing]] Brian, and demands for their dog to go back to the way he used to be. Limbaugh insists Brian became a conservative on his own terms, and the two sing a number based on \"[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying|The Company Way]]\", \"Republican Town\". Brian, outraged by Lois' unsupportive behaviour, decides to move out and become roommates with Limbaugh \u2014 who reluctantly allows him to move into his house. Brian soon begins to irritate Limbaugh with his blind devotion. He replaces lots of Limbaugh's possessions with American-Made versions, which all go wrong. Brian then proceeds to follow Limbaugh to his radio show, where he attempts to voice his own political opinions on the air about Speaker of the House [[Nancy Pelosi]]. This frustrates Limbaugh, who ends up having Brian thrown out. Despite this, Brian continues to try and prove his devotion to the conservative cause by [[waterboarding]] Pelosi \u2014 only to end up getting apprehended and sent to jail.\n\nLater on, Limbaugh [[bail]]s out Brian, but he grows annoyed when Brian again tries to assert his conservatism. This prompts Limbaugh to tell Brian he is only fighting against [[the Establishment]] due to his desire of being the [[underdog (competition)|underdog]]. He proves his point by telling Brian that a child was executed in [[Texas]], causing Brian to be visibly horrified; Limbaugh then says that he made up the story, but Brian's honest reaction to it shows he is a liberal at heart. Reassuring Brian of his liberal convictions, Limbaugh leaves the jail, making a [[The Grapes of Wrath|Grapes of Wrath]]-like pledge to \"be around\" wherever conservative causes need help. Outside, they heckle each other with reassurance before waving goodbye to the other. The episode ends with Brian watching Limbaugh transform into a [[National bird of the United States|bald eagle]] and subsequently flying away into the skyline.\n\n==Production and development==\n[[File:Rush Limbaugh at CPAC (2009).jpg|right|thumb|180px|Limbaugh guest starred as himself in \"Excellence in Broadcasting\".]]\nFirst announced by series creator and executive producer [[Seth MacFarlane]] in an interview on August 13, 2009, the episode was written by series regular [[Patrick Meighan (writer)|Patrick Meighan]], and directed by series regular [[John Holmquist]] shortly after the conclusion of the production of the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth season]]. In the interview, with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', MacFarlane conceded that ''Family Guy'' tends to be very liberal because \"it's written by liberals\". In choosing the conservatives who would be featured in the episode, MacFarlane stated, \"we put it out there to a lot of Republicans&nbsp;\u2014 'we're doing this show, who wants in?'&nbsp;\u2014 and we got some bites.\"<ref name=\"thr\">{{cite magazine |url=http://livefeed.hollywoodreporter.com/2009/08/limbaugh-rove-to-guest-on-family-guy.html |title=Limbaugh, Rove to guest on \u2018Family Guy\u2019 |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2010-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926222327/http://livefeed.hollywoodreporter.com/2009/08/limbaugh-rove-to-guest-on-family-guy.html |archivedate=2010-09-26 }}</ref> Series regulars [[Peter Shin]] and [[James Purdum]] served as supervising director, with [[Andrew Goldberg (writer)|Andrew Goldberg]], Alex Carter, [[Elaine Ko]] and Spencer Porter serving as staff writers for the episode.

It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on October 3, 2010. The episode features [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], an adamant [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]], confronting [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] radio talk show host [[Rush Limbaugh]] at a book signing in [[Quahog, RI|Quahog]], and ultimately having a political change of heart when Limbaugh convinces him to read his latest book. Brian soon decides to become a devoted member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and soon begins criticizing liberals. This leads Brian to become roommates with Limbaugh, and begins following him everywhere; Limbaugh eventually gets annoyed with Brian and ends up disclosing his true political convictions.\n\nThe episode was written by [[Patrick Meighan (writer)|Patrick Meighan]] and directed by [[John Holmquist]]. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references, in addition to receiving both praise and criticism from conservative news outlets. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 7.94 million homes in its original airing. As well as Limbaugh, the episode featured guest performances by [[Gary Cole]], [[Christine Lakin]], [[Phil LaMarr]], [[Shelley Long]], [[Nana Visitor]] and [[Rainn Wilson]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \"Excellence in Broadcasting\" was released on [[DVD]] along with three other episodes from the season on December 13, 2011.\n\n==Plot==\nIn light of \"[[And Then There Were Fewer]]\", the Griffins are watching the news \u2014 where [[List of Family Guy characters#Tom Tucker|Tom Tucker]] reveals that [[Diane Simmons (Family Guy)|Diane Simmons]] committed the murders at [[James Woods]]' mansion and is now dead. He then introduces Diane's successor, [[Joyce Kinney]]. As [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] reads the newspaper, she discovers that conservative radio talk show host [[Rush Limbaugh]] is holding a book signing in [[Quahog, RI|Quahog]]. This enrages [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], who despises Limbaugh over his political beliefs and decides to confront him at the signing. There, Limbaugh is criticized by Brian, but he counters by asking him whether he has read any of his books, leaving Brian dumbfounded and angry. As he curses Limbaugh to himself on his way home, Brian is mugged by a gang; Limbaugh abruptly shows up and beats them all to rescue Brian. Thankful, Brian agrees to read four pages of Limbaugh's book. This he does, but Brian grows interested enough to continue reading the book overnight. By then, he becomes a conservative Republican. Lois questions Brian's conviction, citing his past liberalism, while Brian defends his ability to change his mind based on new information. Lois also mentions that Brian goes out of his way to not agree with the general consensus on many things (for example, he hated ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]'' and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' but defends the movie ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]''), and accuses him of being a \"[[contrarian]]\" rather than a genuine believer. Brian meets with Limbaugh to thank him for helping his political conversion, and the two travel to the Republican National Headquarters, where they are greeted by former President of the United States [[George W. Bush]] and United States Senator [[John McCain]].\n\nReturning home, Lois is unimpressed when Brian tells her that Limbaugh will be coming over for dinner. That night, Lois begins arguing and challenging Limbaugh politically \u2014 with [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] joining in as well. She then accuses Limbaugh of [[brainwashing]] Brian, and demands for their dog to go back to the way he used to be. Limbaugh insists Brian became a conservative on his own terms, and the two sing a number based on \"[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying|The Company Way]]\", \"Republican Town\". Brian, outraged by Lois' unsupportive behaviour, decides to move out and become roommates with Limbaugh \u2014 who reluctantly allows him to move into his house. Brian soon begins to irritate Limbaugh with his blind devotion. He replaces lots of Limbaugh's possessions with American-Made versions, which all go wrong. Brian then proceeds to follow Limbaugh to his radio show, where he attempts to voice his own political opinions on the air about Speaker of the House [[Nancy Pelosi]]. This frustrates Limbaugh, who ends up having Brian thrown out. Despite this, Brian continues to try and prove his devotion to the conservative cause by [[waterboarding]] Pelosi \u2014 only to end up getting apprehended and sent to jail.\n\nLater on, Limbaugh [[bail|bails]] out Brian, but he grows annoyed when Brian again tries to assert his conservatism. This prompts Limbaugh to tell Brian he is only fighting against [[the Establishment]] due to his desire of being the [[underdog (competition)|underdog]]. He proves his point by telling Brian that a child was executed in [[Texas]], causing Brian to be visibly horrified; Limbaugh then says that he made up the story, but Brian's honest reaction to it shows he is a liberal at heart. Reassuring Brian of his liberal convictions, Limbaugh leaves the jail, making a [[The Grapes of Wrath|Grapes of Wrath]]-like pledge to \"be around\" wherever conservative causes need help. Outside, they heckle each other with reassurance before waving goodbye to the other. The episode ends with Brian watching Limbaugh transform into a [[National bird of the United States|bald eagle]] and subsequently flying away into the skyline.\n\n==Production and development==\n[[File:Rush Limbaugh at CPAC (2009).jpg|right|thumb|180px|Limbaugh guest starred as himself in \"Excellence in Broadcasting\".]]\nFirst announced by series creator and executive producer [[Seth MacFarlane]] in an interview on August 13, 2009, the episode was written by series regular [[Patrick Meighan (writer)|Patrick Meighan]], and directed by series regular [[John Holmquist]] shortly after the conclusion of the production of the [[Family Guy (season 8)|eighth season]]. In the interview, with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', MacFarlane conceded that ''Family Guy'' tends to be very liberal because \"it's written by liberals\". In choosing the conservatives who would be featured in the episode, MacFarlane stated, \"we put it out there to a lot of Republicans&nbsp;\u2014 'we're doing this show, who wants in?'&nbsp;\u2014 and we got some bites.\"<ref name=\"thr\">{{cite magazine |url=http://livefeed.hollywoodreporter.com/2009/08/limbaugh-rove-to-guest-on-family-guy.html |title=Limbaugh, Rove to guest on \u2018Family Guy\u2019 |magazine=The Hollywood Reporter |last=Hibberd |first=James |date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2010-09-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926222327/http://livefeed.hollywoodreporter.com/2009/08/limbaugh-rove-to-guest-on-family-guy.html |archivedate=2010-09-26 }}</ref> Series regulars [[Peter Shin]] and [[James Purdum]] served as supervising director, with [[Andrew Goldberg (writer)|Andrew Goldberg]], Alex Carter, [[Elaine Ko]] and Spencer Porter serving as staff writers for the episode.

In 1839, with his friend [[Thomas Edward Plint]], he started and edited a magazine called ''The Leeds Repository'', and on returning to London he co-founded the firm of Tyler & Reed, printers and [[type foundry|typefounders]] in 1842. Reed changed business partners several times, becoming a partner in the famous [[Fann Street Foundry]] in [[Fann Street]] off [[Aldersgate|Aldersgate Street]] in 1866 (which thereby became 'Reed & Fox'). The Fann Street business formed the basis for his own type-founding business ''Sir Charles Reed & Sons'', whose office at 33 Aldersgate Street is illustrated.<ref>ODNB: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23270/23271 Retrieved 13 December 2010.

At one time Reed's had been the larger of the two firms but it had difficulties in financing a modernisation programme as typography changed, and its once valuable equipment became out of date. Indeed, Stephenson Blake's acquisition was thought at the time to be very generous as it looked to be buying little other than the Reed's name and reputation. Not long after, however, thorough cataloguing of Reed's typefaces proved to be a treasure trove. Designs such as the Clarendon typeface, which Charles Reed had originally acquired from Robert Besley & Sons of the Fann Street foundry, became very marketable once re-cast using new technology. Several of Reed's typefaces are now available for use in font collections on our computers, such as Clarendon, which is now owned by a German company (as a trademark of [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen|Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG]] licensed through Linotype Library GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG).<ref>{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}.

Founded in 1867, the Fund was originally established to help support seamen who risked their own lives to save others off the coast near Broadstairs. The following account is attributed by [[Robert Michael Ballantyne|R. M. Ballantyne]] to Sir Charles Reed himself:\n\n\"Eight boatmen of Broadstairs [and their [[lugger]]\u2014the Dreadnought] had for years done good service on the [[Goodwin Sands|Goodwins]]. One night they went off in a tremendous sea to save a French [[barque]]; but though they secured the crew, a steam-tug claimed the [[marine salvage|prize]] and towed her into [[Ramsgate]] Harbour. The Broadstairs men instituted proceedings to secure the salvage, but they were beaten in a London law court, where they were overpowered by the advocacy of a powerful company. In the meantime they lost their lugger off the coast of Normandy, and in this emergency the lawyers they had employed demanded their costs. The poor men had no means, and not being able to pay they were taken from their homes and lodged in [[Maidstone (HM Prison)|Maidstone Gaol]]. He (Sir Charles) was then staying in Broadstairs, and an appeal being made to him, he wrote to ''[[The Times]]'', and in one week received nearly twice the amount required. The bill was paid, the men were liberated and brought home to their families, and the considerable balance... of the amount was invested, the interest to be applied to rewarding boatmen who, by personal bravery, had... saved life on the coast.\"<ref>R.

The London School Board was the first directly elected body covering the whole of London, and a pioneer for its time in other respects too - women were entitled to vote for its board members and also to stand for election as politicians. Reed subsequently became vice-chairman and [[List of heads of London government|chairman]].

As a member of Britain's first Liberal government, he faced a vigorous opponent at the next election in April 1874, when Gladstone was defeated. Lieutenant William Gill stood against him for the Conservatives with support from the ''Independent'' newspaper, which dubbed the constituency ''notorious hitherto as a hotbed of Radicalism''. The vigorous Conservative campaign increased its poll share from 10 per cent to 31 per cent, but Gill still came bottom of the poll. However, the ballot was called into question on procedural grounds, with the result that a new election had to be called three months later. Charles Reed's place was taken by [[Henry Fawcett|Professor Fawcett]] for the Liberals. He chose Holms again as his running mate in the two-seat constituency and this time Gill lost by only a small margin. However, Liberals were always returned until the constituencies of North, Central, and South Hackney were created in 1885.<ref>ODNB: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23270/23271 Retrieved 13 December 2010.

The associated members sought to maintain the site for its religious associations and for its value as open space. It was the only surviving example of a landscape designed by the nurseryman [[Loddiges|George Loddiges]] and boasted an [[arboretum]] of 2500 trees and shrubs. As the only New World cemetery design in Europe it had commissioned an entrance in an Egyptian revival style, to reflect its non-denominational character. The originality of the design and the motive force for acquiring and preserving the site had been [[George Collison]], its first secretary, whose father had tutored Reed's father.\n\nReed, with a firm understanding of the historical importance of the landscape and its educational value, won election as a director of the company for 16 years between 1866 and 1881 and became a principal influence during its last decades as a joint stock company. Reed himself is buried there. Soon after Reed died, the cemetery was made over on 11 April 1882 to a new company run on commercial lines. This laid out a new cemetery, [[Chingford Mount Cemetery]] in 1883\u20131884. Others at [[Hendon Park]] and [[Greenford]] followed.<ref>{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Bunhill Fields==\n[[File:BunhillFieldsCommittee.jpg|350px|thumb|List of members of the Bunhill Fields Preservation Committee]]\n\nThe [[Bunhill Fields]] burial ground is an ancient open space. Until its closure in the mid\u201319th century, many historically important people (particularly those whose religious beliefs ''dissented'' from the Established Church), chose this as their place of quiet interment on the edge of the City.\n\nThe poet [[Robert Southey]] gave Bunhill Fields the memorable appellation the ''Campo Santo of the Dissenters''; a phrase that also came to be applied to its \"daughter\" cemetery at Abney Park. This was a reference to its historical importance as a burial place for religious figures such as [[John Bunyan]] and Dr [[Isaac Watts]].\n[[File:JohnBunyan1862.jpg|thumb|Monument to John Bunyan paid for by public subscription on the preservation of Bunhill Fields Burial Ground as a public park]]\n\nIn a move to prevent the land from being built upon on expiry of a longstanding lease, the Corporation of the City of London formed a special [[Bunhill Fields]] Burial Ground Committee in 1865, which became formally known as the ''Bunhill Fields Preservation Committee''. The committee, appointed by the Corporation, consisted of twelve advisors under Reed's chairmanship. Following the work of the committee, the City of London Corporation obtained an Act of Parliament in 1867 for the Preservation of [[Bunhill Fields]] Burial Ground as a public open space with seating, gardens, and for the restoration of some of its worthiest monuments, including one to [[Daniel Defoe]] funded by ''The Christian World'' and unveiled by Reed. The new park was opened by the Lord Mayor on 14 October 1869.<ref>C. B. E. Reed: ''Memoir of Sir Charles Reed'' (London: Macmillan, 1883), p. 122 ff.</ref>\n\n==Other public activity==\nReed was widely involved in other philanthropic circles. He was an associate of [[George Peabody]], for whom Reed moved the motion of 10 July 1862 granting ''Freedom of the City of London''. He also developed the [[Guildhall Library]] of the City of London, while he was a councillor. His longstanding interest in social and educational improvement in The City of London was also reflected in membership of the [[City of London#The Court of Common Council|Court of Common Council]] and in membership of the board of the [[City of London School]].<ref>C.

Subscription required.]</ref>\n\nThe 'Reed' company name continued into the twentieth century long after Charles Reed's death, though under the proprietorship of Stephenson Blake & Co. who had bought Reed's business interests. At one time Reed's had been the larger of the two firms but it had difficulties in financing a modernisation programme as typography changed, and its once valuable equipment became out of date. Indeed, Stephenson Blake's acquisition was thought at the time to be very generous as it looked to be buying little other than the Reed's name and reputation. Not long after, however, thorough cataloguing of Reed's typefaces proved to be a treasure trove. Designs such as the Clarendon typeface, which Charles Reed had originally acquired from Robert Besley & Sons of the Fann Street foundry, became very marketable once re-cast using new technology. Several of Reed's typefaces are now available for use in font collections on our computers, such as Clarendon, which is now owned by a German company (as a trademark of [[Heidelberger Druckmaschinen|Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG]] licensed through Linotype Library GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary of Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG).<ref>{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}.

Founded in 1867, the Fund was originally established to help support seamen who risked their own lives to save others off the coast near Broadstairs. The following account is attributed by [[Robert Michael Ballantyne|R. M. Ballantyne]] to Sir Charles Reed himself:\n\n\"Eight boatmen of Broadstairs [and their [[lugger]]\u2014the Dreadnought] had for years done good service on the [[Goodwin Sands|Goodwins]]. One night they went off in a tremendous sea to save a French [[barque]]; but though they secured the crew, a steam-tug claimed the [[marine salvage|prize]] and towed her into [[Ramsgate]] Harbour. The Broadstairs men instituted proceedings to secure the salvage, but they were beaten in a London law court, where they were overpowered by the advocacy of a powerful company. In the meantime they lost their lugger off the coast of Normandy, and in this emergency the lawyers they had employed demanded their costs. The poor men had no means, and not being able to pay they were taken from their homes and lodged in [[Maidstone (HM Prison)|Maidstone Gaol]]. He (Sir Charles) was then staying in Broadstairs, and an appeal being made to him, he wrote to ''[[The Times]]'', and in one week received nearly twice the amount required. The bill was paid, the men were liberated and brought home to their families, and the considerable balance... of the amount was invested, the interest to be applied to rewarding boatmen who, by personal bravery, had... saved life on the coast.\"<ref>R.

The London School Board was the first directly elected body covering the whole of London, and a pioneer for its time in other respects too - women were entitled to vote for its board members and also to stand for election as politicians. Reed subsequently became vice-chairman and [[List of heads of London government|chairman]]. He died in office in 1881.<ref>ODNB: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23270/23271 Retrieved 13 December 2010.

As a member of Britain's first Liberal government, he faced a vigorous opponent at the next election in April 1874, when Gladstone was defeated. Lieutenant William Gill stood against him for the Conservatives with support from the ''Independent'' newspaper, which dubbed the constituency ''notorious hitherto as a hotbed of Radicalism''. The vigorous Conservative campaign increased its poll share from 10 per cent to 31 per cent, but Gill still came bottom of the poll. However, the ballot was called into question on procedural grounds, with the result that a new election had to be called three months later. Charles Reed's place was taken by [[Henry Fawcett|Professor Fawcett]] for the Liberals. He chose Holms again as his running mate in the two-seat constituency and this time Gill lost by only a small margin. However, Liberals were always returned until the constituencies of North, Central, and South Hackney were created in 1885.<ref>ODNB: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23270/23271 Retrieved 13 December 2010.

The associated members sought to maintain the site for its religious associations and for its value as open space. It was the only surviving example of a landscape designed by the nurseryman [[Loddiges|George Loddiges]] and boasted an [[arboretum]] of 2500 trees and shrubs. As the only New World cemetery design in Europe it had commissioned an entrance in an Egyptian revival style, to reflect its non-denominational character. The originality of the design and the motive force for acquiring and preserving the site had been [[George Collison]], its first secretary, whose father had tutored Reed's father.\n\nReed, with a firm understanding of the historical importance of the landscape and its educational value, won election as a director of the company for 16 years between 1866 and 1881 and became a principal influence during its last decades as a joint stock company. Reed himself is buried there. Soon after Reed died, the cemetery was made over on 11 April 1882 to a new company run on commercial lines. This laid out a new cemetery, [[Chingford Mount Cemetery]] in 1883\u20131884. Others at [[Hendon Park]] and [[Greenford]] followed.<ref>{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Bunhill Fields==\n[[File:BunhillFieldsCommittee.jpg|350px|thumb|List of members of the Bunhill Fields Preservation Committee]]\n\nThe [[Bunhill Fields]] burial ground is an ancient open space. Until its closure in the mid\u201319th century, many historically important people (particularly those whose religious beliefs ''dissented'' from the Established Church), chose this as their place of quiet interment on the edge of the City.\n\nThe poet [[Robert Southey]] gave Bunhill Fields the memorable appellation the ''Campo Santo of the Dissenters''; a phrase that also came to be applied to its \"daughter\" cemetery at Abney Park. This was a reference to its historical importance as a burial place for religious figures such as [[John Bunyan]] and Dr [[Isaac Watts]].\n[[File:JohnBunyan1862.jpg|thumb|Monument to John Bunyan paid for by public subscription on the preservation of Bunhill Fields Burial Ground as a public park]]\n\nIn a move to prevent the land from being built upon on expiry of a longstanding lease, the Corporation of the City of London formed a special [[Bunhill Fields]] Burial Ground Committee in 1865, which became formally known as the ''Bunhill Fields Preservation Committee''. The committee, appointed by the Corporation, consisted of twelve advisors under Reed's chairmanship. Following the work of the committee, the City of London Corporation obtained an Act of Parliament in 1867 for the Preservation of [[Bunhill Fields]] Burial Ground as a public open space with seating, gardens, and for the restoration of some of its worthiest monuments, including one to [[Daniel Defoe]] funded by ''The Christian World'' and unveiled by Reed. The new park was opened by the Lord Mayor on 14 October 1869.<ref>C. B. E. Reed: ''Memoir of Sir Charles Reed'' (London: Macmillan, 1883), p. 122 ff.</ref>\n\n==Other public activity==\nReed was widely involved in other philanthropic circles. He was an associate of [[George Peabody]], for whom Reed moved the motion of 10 July 1862 granting ''Freedom of the City of London''. He also developed the [[Guildhall Library]] of the City of London, while he was a councillor. His longstanding interest in social and educational improvement in The City of London was also reflected in membership of the [[City of London#The Court of Common Council|Court of Common Council]] and in membership of the board of the [[City of London School]].<ref>C. B. E. Reed: ''Memoir of Sir Charles Reed'' (London: Macmillan, 1883), passim.</ref>\n\nIn the religious field he was active in the [[London Missionary Society]], the British and Foreign Bible Society, the London [[Sunday School]] Union, and the [[Religious Tract Society]]. Returned to Parliament again in 1880 for [[St Ives (UK Parliament constituency)|St Ives]] in [[Cornwall]], he voted against his party in the Bradlaugh debates, deploring [[Charles Bradlaugh]]'s atheism.<ref>ODNB: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/23270/23271 Retrieved 13 December 2010.

McGill becomes the lawyer for former police officer [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), whose skills allow him to enter the criminal underworld of drug trafficking in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].

Jimmy cares for his brother Chuck, who is housebound without electricity because he believes he has electromagnetic hypersensitivity. While pursuing an elder law career, Jimmy discovers clients being defrauded by the Sandpiper retirement home and begins a class action lawsuit with Chuck.

Kim quits at HHM, and she and Jimmy begin separate private practices in a shared office. Jimmy secretly causes Chuck to make an error that delays a new branch construction, so Mesa Verde drops HHM to hire Kim. Nacho hires Mike to remove Tuco from the Salamanca organization. Mike goads Tuco into fighting and Tuco is imprisoned. Hector is suspicious so Mike prepares to assassinate him but is interrupted.\n\n=== Season 3 (2017) ===\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck discovers Jimmy's fraud and tricks him into confessing, leading to suspension of Jimmy's law license.

Gus arranges for Mike's hire as a contracted security expert at Madrigal and payment of monthly consulting fees. Hector plans to take over Manuel's business so Nacho attempts to kill Hector by changing his angina medication for a placebo.

Jimmy manages a cell phone store but makes more reselling prepaid phones. His law license reinstatement request is denied over lack of remorse for Chuck. After faking mourning, he successfully appeals, but reveals he is going to practice as Saul Goodman. Gus learns Nacho attempted to kill Hector and blackmails him into undermining the Salamancas. Mike escorts engineers who evaluate the laundry's potential as a meth lab and Gus hires Werner to oversee construction. Hector recovers mentally and can move his right index finger. Lalo Salamanca arrives to run Hector's business.\n\n===Season 5 (2020)===\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nJimmy's new business as Saul Goodman draws him into the drug trade within Alburquerque.

Gould]], and a prequel and spin-off of Gilligan's prior series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''. Set in the early to mid [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], the series follows the story of con-man turned small-time lawyer Jimmy McGill (played by [[Bob Odenkirk]]), beginning six years before the events of ''Breaking Bad'' and showing his transformation into the persona of criminal for hire [[Saul Goodman]]. McGill becomes the lawyer for former police officer [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), whose skills allow him to enter the criminal underworld of drug trafficking in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. The show premiered on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] on February 8, 2015, airing five seasons to date.

His friend and romantic interest [[Kim Wexler]] ([[Rhea Seehorn]]) works as a lawyer at the firm of Hamlin, Hamlin & McGill (HHM), where she and Jimmy once worked in the mailroom. Partners at HHM include Jimmy's nemesis [[Howard Hamlin]] ([[Patrick Fabian]]) and his brother [[Chuck McGill]] ([[Michael McKean]]). Ehrmantraut conducts illegal drug distribution with [[Nacho Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), in addition to becoming right-hand man for drug lord [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]) who runs a chain of fast food restaurants as a business front. Their operations are disrupted by members of the Salamanca crime family, including [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]). Odenkirk, Banks, and Esposito all reprise their roles from ''Breaking Bad''.\n\n''Better Call Saul'' has received critical acclaim, with particular praise for its acting, characters, and cinematography; many critics have called it a worthy successor to ''Breaking Bad'' and one of the best prequels ever made, with some deeming it superior to its predecessor.<ref name=\"sallgoodman\">{{cite web |last1=Heritage |first1=Stuart |title='S'all good, man': How Better Call Saul became superior to Breaking Bad |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/oct/11/sall-good-man-how-better-call-saul-became-superior-to-breaking-bad |website=The Guardian |date=October 11, 2018 |accessdate=October 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Kelly |first=Stephen |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/20/better-call-saul-breaking-bad-vince-gilligan |title=The perfect prequel: how Better Call Saul left Breaking Bad in its dust |work=The Guardian |date=June 20, 2017 |accessdate=August 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Turner |first=Julia |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2016/04/18/better_call_saul_is_better_than_breaking_bad.html |title=Better Call Saul Is Better Than Breaking Bad |work=Slate |date=April 18, 2016 |accessdate=September 25, 2018}}</ref> It has garnered many nominations, including a [[Peabody Award]], 23 [[Primetime Emmy Awards]], eleven [[Writers Guild of America Awards]], five [[Critics' Choice Television Awards]], a [[Screen Actors Guild Award]], and two [[Golden Globe Award]]s.

This includes the uneasy truce between the Salamanca family that serves the [[Ju\u00e1rez Cartel]] drug interest and later led by [[Lalo Salamanca]] ([[Tony Dalton]]) when their patriarch falls ill, and [[Gus Fring]] ([[Giancarlo Esposito]]), a restaurant entrepreneur that uses his stores as a front for the drug trade. Among those caught up in these events include [[Ignacio Varga|Ignacio \"Nacho\" Varga]] ([[Michael Mando]]), an enforcer for the Salamancas who only wants to protect his father from harm, and [[Mike Ehrmantraut]] ([[Jonathan Banks]]), a former police officer who becomes a [[fixer (person)|fixer]] for Gus.\n\nThe show also includes flash-forwards at the start of each season's premiere following the events of ''Breaking Bad'', where Saul has paid to take on a new identity as Gene Takovic, the manager of a [[Cinnabon]] store in [[Omaha, Nebraska]].\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Conception ===\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|align=right|total_width=300\n|image1=Vince_Gilligan_by_Gage_Skidmore_3.jpg\n|image2=Peter Gould by Gage Skidmore.jpg\n|footer=''Better Call Saul'' was developed by [[Vince Gilligan]] (left) and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]].\n}}\n[[Vince Gilligan]] and [[Peter Gould (writer)|Peter Gould]] began planning a [[television spinoff]] of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' as early as 2009.

Jimmy cares for his brother Chuck, who is housebound without electricity because he believes he has electromagnetic hypersensitivity. While pursuing an elder law career, Jimmy discovers clients being defrauded by the Sandpiper retirement home and begins a class action lawsuit with Chuck.

Kim quits at HHM, and she and Jimmy begin separate private practices in a shared office. Jimmy secretly causes Chuck to make an error that delays a new branch construction, so Mesa Verde drops HHM to hire Kim. Nacho hires Mike to remove Tuco from the Salamanca organization. Mike goads Tuco into fighting and Tuco is imprisoned. Hector is suspicious so Mike prepares to assassinate him but is interrupted.\n\n=== Season 3 (2017) ===\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nChuck discovers Jimmy's fraud and tricks him into confessing, leading to suspension of Jimmy's law license.

Gus arranges for Mike's hire as a contracted security expert at Madrigal and payment of monthly consulting fees. Hector plans to take over Manuel's business so Nacho attempts to kill Hector by changing his angina medication for a placebo.

Jimmy manages a cell phone store but makes more reselling prepaid phones. His law license reinstatement request is denied over lack of remorse for Chuck. After faking mourning, he successfully appeals, but reveals he is going to practice as Saul Goodman. Gus learns Nacho attempted to kill Hector and blackmails him into undermining the Salamancas. Mike escorts engineers who evaluate the laundry's potential as a meth lab and Gus hires Werner to oversee construction. Hector recovers mentally and can move his right index finger. Lalo Salamanca arrives to run Hector's business.\n\n===Season 5 (2020)===\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nJimmy's new business as Saul Goodman draws him into the drug trade within Alburquerque.
