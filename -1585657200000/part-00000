In other countries, such as France, political advertising on television is heavily restricted,<ref>Fritz Plasser,''Global Political Campaigning'', p226</ref> while some countries, such as [[Norway]], completely ban political advertisements.\n\nThe first official, paid television advertisement came out in the United States on July 1, 1941, over New York station WNBT (subsequently [[WNBC]]) before a baseball game between the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and [[Philadelphia Phillies]]. The announcement for [[Bulova]] watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase \"Bulova Watch Time\", appeared in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.<ref>\"Imagery For Profit\" R.W.

Retrieved November 13, 2018</ref>\n\nTo accomplish the first step means different things to different parts of the world depending on the regulations in place. In the UK for example, clearance must be given by the body [[Clearcast]]. Another example is Venezuela where clearance is governed by a body called CNAC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnac.gob.ve/|title=CNAC \u2013 Ente rector de la Plataforma del Cine y Medios Audiovisuales de Venezuela.|last=cnac.gob.ve|website=cnac.gob.ve|access-date=January 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220010035/http://www.cnac.gob.ve/|archive-date=February 20, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The clearance provides guarantee to the broadcasters that the content of the advertisement meets legal guidelines. Because of this, special extended clearance sometimes applies to food and medical products as well as gambling advertisements.\n\nThe second is the process of TV advertising delivery and usually incorporates the involvement of a [[post-production]] house, a [[media agency]], advertising distribution specialists and the end-goal, the broadcasters.\n\nAt New York's TV Week in November, 2018 the TV advertising model was described by [[Turner Broadcasting System]] as broken.<ref>[https://www.dativa.com/thoughts-on-tv-week/ Thoughts on TV Week] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112223329/https://www.dativa.com/thoughts-on-tv-week/ |date=November 12, 2018 }} Published by dativa.com, November 7, 2018.

Advertising agencies fought the trend by making them more entertaining.<ref name=\"deatley19850907\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lc8vAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1Y0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5630%2C870934 | title=VCRs put entertainment industry into fast-forward frenzy | work=The Free Lance-Star | date=September 7, 1985 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=January 25, 2015 | author=De Atley, Richard | pages=12\u2013TV}}</ref> The introduction of [[digital video recorder]]s (also known as digital television recorders or DTRs), such as [[TiVo]], and services like [[Sky+]], Dish Network and Astro MAX, which allow the recording of television programs into a [[hard drive]], also enabled viewers to fast-forward or [[Commercial skipping|automatically skip through advertisements]] of recorded programs.\n\nAt the end of 2008 22 percent of UK households had a DTR. The majority of these households had [[Sky+]] and data from these homes (collected via the SkyView<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skymedia.co.uk/Audience-Insight/skyview.aspx |title=SkyView |publisher=Skymedia.co.uk |accessdate=September 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903074734/http://www.skymedia.co.uk/Audience-Insight/skyview.aspx |archive-date=September 3, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> panel of more than 33,000) shows that, once a household gets a DTR, they watch 17 percent more television. 82 percent of their viewing is to normal, linear, broadcast TV without fast-forwarding the ads. In the 18 percent of TV viewing that is time-shifted (i.e. not watched as live broadcast), viewers still watch 30 percent of the ads at normal speed. Overall, the extra viewing encouraged by owning a DTR results in viewers watching 2 percent more ads at normal speed than they did before the DTR was installed.\n\nThe SkyView evidence is reinforced by studies on actual DTR behaviour by the [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] (BARB) and the [[London Business School]].\n\n===Product placement===\nOther forms of TV advertising include [[product placement]] advertising in the TV shows themselves. For example, ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' advertises [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]], [[Kenmore Appliances|Kenmore]], and [[the Home Depot]] by specifically using products from these companies, and some sports events like the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Monster Energy Cup]] of [[NASCAR]] are named after sponsors, and race cars are frequently covered in advertisements. Many major sporting venues in North America are named for commercial companies, dating back as far as [[Wrigley Field]]. Television programs delivered through new mediums such as streaming online video also bring different opportunities to the traditional methods of generating revenue from television advertising.\n\n===Overlay advertisements===\nAnother type of advertisement shown increasingly, mostly for advertising TV shows on the same channel, is an ad overlay at the bottom of the TV screen, which blocks out some of the picture. \"Banners\", or \"Logo Bugs\", as they are called, are referred to by media companies as Secondary Events (2E). This is done in much the same way as a severe weather warning is done, only these happen more frequently. They may sometimes take up only 5 to 10 percent of the screen, but in the extreme, they can take up as much as 25 percent of the viewing area. Subtitles that are part of the programme content can be completely obscured by banners. Some even make noise or move across the screen. One example is the 2E ads for [[Three Moons Over Milford]], which was broadcast in the months before the TV show's premi\u00e8re. A video taking up approximately 25 percent of the bottom-left portion of the screen would show a comet impacting into the moon with an accompanying explosion, during another television programme.\n\n===Interactive advertisements===\nOnline video directories are an emerging form of [[interactive advertising]], which help in recalling and responding to advertising produced primarily for television. These directories also have the potential to offer other value-added services, such as response sheets and click-to-call, which enhance the scope of the interaction with the brand.\n\n===Shorter commercial breaks===\nDuring the 2008\u201309 TV season, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] experimented with a new strategy, which the network dubbed \"Remote-Free TV\". Episodes of ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' and ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'' contained approximately ten minutes of advertisements, four to six minutes fewer than other hour-long programs. Fox stated that shorter commercial breaks keep viewers more engaged and improve brand recall for advertisers, as well as reducing channel surfing and fast-forwarding past the advertisements. However, the strategy was not as successful as the network had hoped and it is unclear whether it will be continued in the future.<ref name=\"remotefree\">{{cite news | author = Brian Stelter | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/business/media/13adco.html?_r=1&ref=media | title = Fox TV's Gamble: Fewer Ads in a Break, but Costing More | date = February 12, 2009 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = February 13, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130512184242/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/business/media/13adco.html?_r=1&ref=media | archive-date = May 12, 2013 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2018, [[Fox Networks Group]] said its channels would try one-minute commercial breaks, mainly during sports events, but also on some shows on [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].

Many psychological studies have attempted to demonstrate the effects of humor and their relationship to empowering advertising persuasion.\n\n[[Animated cartoon|Animation]] is often used in advertisements. The pictures can vary from hand-drawn [[traditional animation]] to computer animation. By using [[character animation|animated characters]], an advertisement may have a certain appeal that is difficult to achieve with actors or mere product displays. Animation also protects the advertisement from changes in fashion that would date it. For this reason, an animated advertisement (or a series of such advertisements) can be very long-running, several decades in many instances. Notable examples are the series of advertisements for [[Kellogg's]] cereals, starring [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] and also [[Tony the Tiger]]. The animation is often [[Live-action/animated film|combined]] with real actors. Animated advertisements can achieve lasting popularity. In any popular vote for the most memorable television advertisements in the UK, such as on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/nav.943 |title=thinkbox \u2013 Classic Ads |publisher=Thinkbox.tv |accessdate=November 30, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305130459/http://thinkbox.tv/server/show/nav.943 |archivedate=March 5, 2009 }}</ref> or [[Channel 4]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_ads/results.html |title=Explore |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=November 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403035953/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_ads/results.html |archive-date=April 3, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> the top positions in the list invariably include animations, such as the classic ''Smash'' and [[Creature Comforts]] advertisements.\n\nOther long-running advertising campaigns catch people by surprise, even tricking the viewer, such as the [[Energizer Bunny]] advertisement series. It started in the late 1980s as a simple comparison advertisement, where a room full of battery-operated bunnies was seen pounding their drums, all slowing down except one, with the Energizer battery. Years later, a revised version of this seminal advertisement had the Energizer bunny escaping the stage and moving on (according to the announcer, he \"keeps going and going and going...\"). This was followed by what appeared to be another advertisement: viewers were oblivious to the fact that the following \"advertisement\" was actually a [[parody advertisement|parody]] of other well-known advertisements until the Energizer bunny suddenly intrudes on the situation, with the announcer saying \"Still going...\" (the Energizer Battery Company's way of emphasizing that their battery lasts longer than other leading batteries). This ad campaign lasted for nearly fifteen years. The Energizer Bunny series has itself been imitated by others, via a [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors Light Beer]] advertisement, in motion pictures, and by current advertisements by [[GEICO]] Insurance.\n\n===Use of popular music===\nMany television advertisements feature songs or melodies (\"[[jingle]]s\") or slogans designed to be striking and memorable, which may remain in the minds of television viewers long after the span of the advertising campaign. Some of these ad jingles or catch-phrases may take on lives of their own, spawning gags that appear in films, television shows, magazines, [[comics]], or literature. These long-lasting advertising elements may be said to have taken a place in the [[popular culture|pop culture]] history of the demographic to whom they appeared. An example is the enduring phrase, \"[[Winston tastes good like a cigarette should]]\", from the eighteen-year advertising campaign for [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston cigarettes]] from the 1950s to the 1970s. Variations of this dialogue and direct references to it appeared as long as two decades after the advertising campaign expired. Another example is \"[[Where's the Beef?]]\", which grew so popular it was used in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]] by [[Walter Mondale]]. Another popular catch-phrase is \"[[I've fallen and I can't get up]]\", which still appears occasionally, over two decades after its first use. Some advertising agency executives have originated more than one enduring slogan, such as [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], who is responsible for such famous slogans as \"Raise your hand if you're Sure\", \"[[I Love New York|I\u2665New York]]\" and \"Trust the Midas touch.\"\n\nPrior to the 1970s, music in television advertisements was generally limited to [[jingle]]s and [[incidental music]]; on some occasions lyrics to a popular song would be changed to create a theme song or a jingle for a particular product. An example of this is found on the recent popular Gocompare.com advert that utilises \"Over There\", the 1917 song popular with United States soldiers in both World Wars and written by George M. Cohan during World War I.  In 1971 the converse occurred when a song written for a [[Coca-Cola]] advertisement was re-recorded as the pop single \"[[I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)]]\" by the [[New Seekers]], and became a hit. Additionally songwriter [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] composed a piece for a Crocker Bank commercial which he lengthened and [[The Carpenters]] recorded as \"[[We've Only Just Begun]]\".  Some pop and rock songs were re-recorded by cover bands for use in advertisements, but the cost of licensing original recordings for this purpose remained prohibitive in certain countries (including the U.S.) until the late 1980s.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe use of previously recorded popular songs in American television advertisements began in earnest in 1985 when [[Burger King]] used the original recording of [[Aretha Franklin]]'s song  \"[[Freeway of Love]]\" in a television advertisement for the restaurant. This also occurred in 1987 when [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] used the original recording of [[The Beatles]]' song \"[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]\" in an advertisement for athletic shoes.  Since then, many classic popular songs have been used in similar fashion.  Songs can be used to concretely illustrate a point about the product being sold (such as [[Bob Seger]]'s \"[[Like a Rock (song)|Like a Rock]]\" used for [[Chevrolet|Chevy]] trucks), but more often are simply used to associate the good feelings listeners had for the song to the product on display.  In some cases the original meaning of the song can be totally irrelevant or even completely opposite to the implication of the use in advertising; for example [[Iggy Pop]]'s \"[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop song)|Lust for Life]]\", a song about heroin addiction, has been used to advertise [[Royal Caribbean International]], a cruise ship line.  Music-licensing agreements with major artists, especially those that had not previously allowed their recordings to be used for this purpose, such as [[Microsoft]]'s use of \"[[Start Me Up]]\" by [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Apple Inc.]]'s use of [[U2]]'s \"[[Vertigo (U2 song)|Vertigo]]\" became a source of publicity in themselves.\n\nIn early instances, songs were often used over the objections of the original artists,{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} who had lost control of their [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing]], the music of the Beatles being perhaps the most well-known case; more recently artists have actively solicited use of their music in advertisements and songs have gained popularity and sales after being used in advertisements. A famous case is [[Levi's]] company, which has used several [[one hit wonder]]s in their advertisements (songs such as [[Stiltskin|\"Inside\"]], [[Spaceman (Babylon Zoo song)|\"Spaceman\"]], and \"[[Flat Beat]]\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Levi's TV Advert Music \u2013 Sounds-Familiar|url=http://www.sounds-familiar.info/tag/levis/|accessdate=November 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112193251/http://www.sounds-familiar.info/tag/levis/|archive-date=November 12, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2010, research conducted by [[PRS for Music]] revealed that \"[[Light & Day]]\" by [[The Polyphonic Spree]] is the most performed song in UK TV advertising.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/7605314/Sainsburys-song-tops-adverts-playlist.html |title=Sainsbury's song tops adverts playlist |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=April 19, 2010 |accessdate=September 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902101809/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/7605314/Sainsburys-song-tops-adverts-playlist.html |archive-date=September 2, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nSometimes a controversial reaction has followed the use of some particular song on an advertisement. Often the trouble has been that people do not like the idea of using songs that promote values important for them in advertisements.

Retrieved November 13, 2018</ref>\n\nTo accomplish the first step means different things to different parts of the world depending on the regulations in place. In the UK for example, clearance must be given by the body [[Clearcast]]. Another example is Venezuela where clearance is governed by a body called CNAC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnac.gob.ve/|title=CNAC \u2013 Ente rector de la Plataforma del Cine y Medios Audiovisuales de Venezuela.|last=cnac.gob.ve|website=cnac.gob.ve|access-date=January 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220010035/http://www.cnac.gob.ve/|archive-date=February 20, 2015|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The clearance provides guarantee to the broadcasters that the content of the advertisement meets legal guidelines. Because of this, special extended clearance sometimes applies to food and medical products as well as gambling advertisements.\n\nThe second is the process of TV advertising delivery and usually incorporates the involvement of a [[post-production]] house, a [[media agency]], advertising distribution specialists and the end-goal, the broadcasters.\n\nAt New York's TV Week in November, 2018 the TV advertising model was described by [[Turner Broadcasting System]] as broken.<ref>[https://www.dativa.com/thoughts-on-tv-week/ Thoughts on TV Week] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112223329/https://www.dativa.com/thoughts-on-tv-week/ |date=November 12, 2018 }} Published by dativa.com, November 7, 2018.

Advertising agencies fought the trend by making them more entertaining.<ref name=\"deatley19850907\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lc8vAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1Y0DAAAAIBAJ&pg=5630%2C870934 | title=VCRs put entertainment industry into fast-forward frenzy | work=The Free Lance-Star | date=September 7, 1985 | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=January 25, 2015 | author=De Atley, Richard | pages=12\u2013TV}}</ref> The introduction of [[digital video recorder]]s (also known as digital television recorders or DTRs), such as [[TiVo]], and services like [[Sky+]], Dish Network and Astro MAX, which allow the recording of television programs into a [[hard drive]], also enabled viewers to fast-forward or [[Commercial skipping|automatically skip through advertisements]] of recorded programs.\n\nAt the end of 2008 22 percent of UK households had a DTR. The majority of these households had [[Sky+]] and data from these homes (collected via the SkyView<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skymedia.co.uk/Audience-Insight/skyview.aspx |title=SkyView |publisher=Skymedia.co.uk |accessdate=September 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903074734/http://www.skymedia.co.uk/Audience-Insight/skyview.aspx |archive-date=September 3, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> panel of more than 33,000) shows that, once a household gets a DTR, they watch 17 percent more television. 82 percent of their viewing is to normal, linear, broadcast TV without fast-forwarding the ads. In the 18 percent of TV viewing that is time-shifted (i.e. not watched as live broadcast), viewers still watch 30 percent of the ads at normal speed. Overall, the extra viewing encouraged by owning a DTR results in viewers watching 2 percent more ads at normal speed than they did before the DTR was installed.\n\nThe SkyView evidence is reinforced by studies on actual DTR behaviour by the [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] (BARB) and the [[London Business School]].\n\n===Product placement===\nOther forms of TV advertising include [[product placement]] advertising in the TV shows themselves. For example, ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' advertises [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]], [[Kenmore Appliances|Kenmore]], and [[the Home Depot]] by specifically using products from these companies, and some sports events like the [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Monster Energy Cup]] of [[NASCAR]] are named after sponsors, and race cars are frequently covered in advertisements. Many major sporting venues in North America are named for commercial companies, dating back as far as [[Wrigley Field]]. Television programs delivered through new mediums such as streaming online video also bring different opportunities to the traditional methods of generating revenue from television advertising.\n\n===Overlay advertisements===\nAnother type of advertisement shown increasingly, mostly for advertising TV shows on the same channel, is an ad overlay at the bottom of the TV screen, which blocks out some of the picture. \"Banners\", or \"Logo Bugs\", as they are called, are referred to by media companies as Secondary Events (2E). This is done in much the same way as a severe weather warning is done, only these happen more frequently. They may sometimes take up only 5 to 10 percent of the screen, but in the extreme, they can take up as much as 25 percent of the viewing area. Subtitles that are part of the programme content can be completely obscured by banners. Some even make noise or move across the screen. One example is the 2E ads for [[Three Moons Over Milford]], which was broadcast in the months before the TV show's premi\u00e8re. A video taking up approximately 25 percent of the bottom-left portion of the screen would show a comet impacting into the moon with an accompanying explosion, during another television programme.\n\n===Interactive advertisements===\nOnline video directories are an emerging form of [[interactive advertising]], which help in recalling and responding to advertising produced primarily for television. These directories also have the potential to offer other value-added services, such as response sheets and click-to-call, which enhance the scope of the interaction with the brand.\n\n===Shorter commercial breaks===\nDuring the 2008\u201309 TV season, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] experimented with a new strategy, which the network dubbed \"Remote-Free TV\". Episodes of ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' and ''[[Dollhouse (TV series)|Dollhouse]]'' contained approximately ten minutes of advertisements, four to six minutes fewer than other hour-long programs. Fox stated that shorter commercial breaks keep viewers more engaged and improve brand recall for advertisers, as well as reducing channel surfing and fast-forwarding past the advertisements. However, the strategy was not as successful as the network had hoped and it is unclear whether it will be continued in the future.<ref name=\"remotefree\">{{cite news | author = Brian Stelter | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/business/media/13adco.html?_r=1&ref=media | title = Fox TV's Gamble: Fewer Ads in a Break, but Costing More | date = February 12, 2009 | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = February 13, 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130512184242/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/business/media/13adco.html?_r=1&ref=media | archive-date = May 12, 2013 | url-status = live | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2018, [[Fox Networks Group]] said its channels would try one-minute commercial breaks, mainly during sports events, but also on some shows on [[Fox Broadcasting Company]].

Many psychological studies have attempted to demonstrate the effects of humor and their relationship to empowering advertising persuasion.\n\n[[Animated cartoon|Animation]] is often used in advertisements. The pictures can vary from hand-drawn [[traditional animation]] to computer animation. By using [[character animation|animated characters]], an advertisement may have a certain appeal that is difficult to achieve with actors or mere product displays. Animation also protects the advertisement from changes in fashion that would date it. For this reason, an animated advertisement (or a series of such advertisements) can be very long-running, several decades in many instances. Notable examples are the series of advertisements for [[Kellogg's]] cereals, starring [[Snap, Crackle and Pop]] and also [[Tony the Tiger]]. The animation is often [[Live-action/animated film|combined]] with real actors. Animated advertisements can achieve lasting popularity. In any popular vote for the most memorable television advertisements in the UK, such as on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thinkbox.tv/server/show/nav.943 |title=thinkbox \u2013 Classic Ads |publisher=Thinkbox.tv |accessdate=November 30, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305130459/http://thinkbox.tv/server/show/nav.943 |archivedate=March 5, 2009 }}</ref> or [[Channel 4]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_ads/results.html |title=Explore |publisher=Channel 4 |accessdate=November 30, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100403035953/http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/G/greatest/tv_ads/results.html |archive-date=April 3, 2010 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref> the top positions in the list invariably include animations, such as the classic ''Smash'' and [[Creature Comforts]] advertisements.\n\nOther long-running advertising campaigns catch people by surprise, even tricking the viewer, such as the [[Energizer Bunny]] advertisement series. It started in the late 1980s as a simple comparison advertisement, where a room full of battery-operated bunnies was seen pounding their drums, all slowing down except one, with the Energizer battery. Years later, a revised version of this seminal advertisement had the Energizer bunny escaping the stage and moving on (according to the announcer, he \"keeps going and going and going...\"). This was followed by what appeared to be another advertisement: viewers were oblivious to the fact that the following \"advertisement\" was actually a [[parody advertisement|parody]] of other well-known advertisements until the Energizer bunny suddenly intrudes on the situation, with the announcer saying \"Still going...\" (the Energizer Battery Company's way of emphasizing that their battery lasts longer than other leading batteries). This ad campaign lasted for nearly fifteen years. The Energizer Bunny series has itself been imitated by others, via a [[Coors Brewing Company|Coors Light Beer]] advertisement, in motion pictures, and by current advertisements by [[GEICO]] Insurance.\n\n===Use of popular music===\nMany television advertisements feature songs or melodies (\"[[jingle]]s\") or slogans designed to be striking and memorable, which may remain in the minds of television viewers long after the span of the advertising campaign. Some of these ad jingles or catch-phrases may take on lives of their own, spawning gags that appear in films, television shows, magazines, [[comics]], or literature. These long-lasting advertising elements may be said to have taken a place in the [[popular culture|pop culture]] history of the demographic to whom they appeared. An example is the enduring phrase, \"[[Winston tastes good like a cigarette should]]\", from the eighteen-year advertising campaign for [[Winston (cigarette)|Winston cigarettes]] from the 1950s to the 1970s. Variations of this dialogue and direct references to it appeared as long as two decades after the advertising campaign expired. Another example is \"[[Where's the Beef?]]\", which grew so popular it was used in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]] by [[Walter Mondale]]. Another popular catch-phrase is \"[[I've fallen and I can't get up]]\", which still appears occasionally, over two decades after its first use. Some advertising agency executives have originated more than one enduring slogan, such as [[Mary Wells Lawrence]], who is responsible for such famous slogans as \"Raise your hand if you're Sure\", \"[[I Love New York|I\u2665New York]]\" and \"Trust the Midas touch.\"\n\nPrior to the 1970s, music in television advertisements was generally limited to [[jingle]]s and [[incidental music]]; on some occasions lyrics to a popular song would be changed to create a theme song or a jingle for a particular product. An example of this is found on the recent popular Gocompare.com advert that utilises \"Over There\", the 1917 song popular with United States soldiers in both World Wars and written by George M. Cohan during World War I.  In 1971 the converse occurred when a song written for a [[Coca-Cola]] advertisement was re-recorded as the pop single \"[[I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing (In Perfect Harmony)]]\" by the [[New Seekers]], and became a hit. Additionally songwriter [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] composed a piece for a Crocker Bank commercial which he lengthened and [[The Carpenters]] recorded as \"[[We've Only Just Begun]]\".  Some pop and rock songs were re-recorded by cover bands for use in advertisements, but the cost of licensing original recordings for this purpose remained prohibitive in certain countries (including the U.S.) until the late 1980s.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe use of previously recorded popular songs in American television advertisements began in earnest in 1985 when [[Burger King]] used the original recording of [[Aretha Franklin]]'s song  \"[[Freeway of Love]]\" in a television advertisement for the restaurant. This also occurred in 1987 when [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] used the original recording of [[The Beatles]]' song \"[[Revolution (Beatles song)|Revolution]]\" in an advertisement for athletic shoes.  Since then, many classic popular songs have been used in similar fashion.  Songs can be used to concretely illustrate a point about the product being sold (such as [[Bob Seger]]'s \"[[Like a Rock (song)|Like a Rock]]\" used for [[Chevrolet|Chevy]] trucks), but more often are simply used to associate the good feelings listeners had for the song to the product on display.  In some cases the original meaning of the song can be totally irrelevant or even completely opposite to the implication of the use in advertising; for example [[Iggy Pop]]'s \"[[Lust for Life (Iggy Pop song)|Lust for Life]]\", a song about heroin addiction, has been used to advertise [[Royal Caribbean International]], a cruise ship line.  Music-licensing agreements with major artists, especially those that had not previously allowed their recordings to be used for this purpose, such as [[Microsoft]]'s use of \"[[Start Me Up]]\" by [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[Apple Inc.]]'s use of [[U2]]'s \"[[Vertigo (U2 song)|Vertigo]]\" became a source of publicity in themselves.\n\nIn early instances, songs were often used over the objections of the original artists,{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} who had lost control of their [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishing]], the music of the Beatles being perhaps the most well-known case; more recently artists have actively solicited use of their music in advertisements and songs have gained popularity and sales after being used in advertisements. A famous case is [[Levi's]] company, which has used several [[one hit wonder]]s in their advertisements (songs such as [[Stiltskin|\"Inside\"]], [[Spaceman (Babylon Zoo song)|\"Spaceman\"]], and \"[[Flat Beat]]\").<ref>{{cite web|title=Levi's TV Advert Music \u2013 Sounds-Familiar|url=http://www.sounds-familiar.info/tag/levis/|accessdate=November 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181112193251/http://www.sounds-familiar.info/tag/levis/|archive-date=November 12, 2018|url-status=live|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 2010, research conducted by [[PRS for Music]] revealed that \"[[Light & Day]]\" by [[The Polyphonic Spree]] is the most performed song in UK TV advertising.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/7605314/Sainsburys-song-tops-adverts-playlist.html |title=Sainsbury's song tops adverts playlist |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=April 19, 2010 |accessdate=September 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902101809/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-news/7605314/Sainsburys-song-tops-adverts-playlist.html |archive-date=September 2, 2013 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nSometimes a controversial reaction has followed the use of some particular song on an advertisement. Often the trouble has been that people do not like the idea of using songs that promote values important for them in advertisements. For example, [[Sly and the Family Stone]]'s anti-racism song, \"[[Everyday People (Sly & the Family Stone song)|Everyday People]]\", was used in a car advertisement, which angered some people.{{who|date=November 2010}}{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nGeneric [[Music in advertising|scores for advertisements]] often feature [[clarinet]]s, saxophones, or various [[string instrument|strings]] (such as the [[Classical guitar|acoustic]]/electric guitars and violins) as the primary instruments.\n\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, electronica music was increasingly used as background scores for television advertisements, initially for automobiles,<ref name=\"taylor\">''The Changing Shape of the Culture Industry; or, How Did Electronica Music Get into Television Commercials?'', Timothy D.

These resources found in South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere. However, the concentration in producing one major export [[commodity]] often has hindered the development of diversified economies. The fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often causing extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify production to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export.\n\nSouth America is one of the most biodiverse continents on earth. South America is home to many interesting and unique species of animals including the [[llama]], [[anaconda]], [[piranha]], [[jaguar]], [[vicu\u00f1a]], and [[tapir]].

The northern and eastern parts of the Argentine pampas have a [[Subtropics|humid subtropical climate]] with dry winters and humid summers of the Chinese type, while the western and eastern ranges have a subtropical climate of the dinaric type. At the highest points of the Andean region, climates are colder than the ones occurring at the highest point of the Norwegian fjords. In the Andean plateaus, the warm climate prevails, although it is tempered by the altitude, while in the coastal strip, there is an equatorial climate of the Guinean type. From this point until the north of the Chilean coast appear, successively, [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean oceanic climate]], temperate of the Breton type and, already in [[Tierra del Fuego]], cold climate of the Siberian type.<ref name=\"Climate\"/>\n\nThe distribution of rainfall is related to the regime of winds and air masses. In most of the [[tropical region]] east of the Andes, winds blowing from the northeast, east and southeast carry moisture from the Atlantic, causing abundant rainfall. However, due to a consistently strong [[wind shear]] and a weak [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], [[South Atlantic tropical cyclone]]s are rare.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G6.html\n | title =Why doesn't the South Atlantic Ocean experience tropical cyclones?\n | last =Landsea\n | first =Chris\n | date =13 July 2005\n | website =Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorlogical Laboratory\n | publisher =National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration\n | access-date =9 June 2018\n | quote = }}</ref> In the [[Los Llanos (South America)|Orinoco Llanos]] and in the [[The Guianas|Guianas plateau]], the precipitation levels go from moderate to high.

The moderately dry conditions of the Chaco oppose the intense rainfall of the eastern region of Paraguay. In the [[semiarid]] coast of the Brazilian Northeast the rains are linked to a monsoon regime.<ref name=\"Climate\"/>\n\nImportant factors in the determination of climates are sea currents, such as the current Humboldt and [[Falklands]]. The equatorial current of the South Atlantic strikes the coast of the Northeast and there is divided into two others: the current of Brazil and a coastal current that flows to the northwest towards the [[Antilles]], where there it moves towards northeast course thus forming the most Important and famous ocean current in the world, the [[Gulf Stream]].<ref name=\"Climate\"/><ref name=\"Know.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.knoow.net/ciencterravida/geografia/correntegolfo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411062149/http://www.knoow.net/ciencterravida/geografia/correntegolfo.htm |archivedate=11 April 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of South America}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{further|History of South America#Pre-Columbian era}}\n[[File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg|thumb|The prehistoric [[Cueva de las Manos]], or \"Cave of the Hands\", in Argentina]]\nSouth America is believed to have been joined with Africa from the late [[Paleozoic Era]] to the early [[Mesozoic Era]], until the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] began to rift and break apart about 225 million years ago. Therefore, South America and Africa share similar fossils and rock layers.\n\nSouth America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] (now the [[Bering Strait]]) at least 15,000 years ago from the territory that is present-day Russia. They migrated south through North America, and eventually reached South America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]].\n\nThe first evidence for the existence of the human race in South America dates back to about 9000 BC, when [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], [[chili pepper]]s and [[bean]]s began to be cultivated for food in the highlands of the [[Amazon Basin]]. Pottery evidence further suggests that [[manioc]], which remains a [[staple food]] today, was being cultivated as early as 2000 BC.<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\">O'Brien, Patrick.

Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an [[agrarian society]].<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\"/>\n\nSouth American cultures began domesticating [[llama]]s, [[vicu\u00f1a]]s, [[guanaco]]s, and [[alpaca]]s in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods.<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\"/>\n\n===Pre-Columbian civilizations===\n{{Main|Pre-Columbian era#South America}}\n[[File:Machu Picchu, Per\u00fa, 2015-07-30, DD 39.JPG|alt=|thumb|The Inca estate of [[Machu Picchu]], [[Peru]] is one of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World#Winners|New Seven Wonders of the World]].]]\n\nThe rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America.\n\nOne of the earliest known South American civilizations was at [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], on the central [[Peru]]vian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Norte Chico is contemporaneous with the pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Norte Chico governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture then followed by [[Chavin culture|Chav\u00edn]] by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called [[Chav\u00edn de Huantar]] in modern Peru at an elevation of {{convert|3177|m|sp=us||}}. Chav\u00edn civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.\n\nIn the central coast of Peru, around the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] (100 BC&nbsp;\u2013 700 AD, at the northern coast of Peru), [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] (400 BC&nbsp;\u2013 800 AD, Peru) cultures flourished with centralized states with permanent militia improving agriculture through [[irrigation]] and new styles of ceramic art. At the [[Altiplano]], Tiahuanaco or [[Tiwanaku]] (100 BC&nbsp;\u2013 1200 AD, Bolivia) managed a large commercial network based on religion.\n\nAround the 7th century, both Tiahuanaco and Wari or [[Wari culture|Huari]] Empire (600\u20131200, Central and northern Peru) expanded its influence to all the Andean region, imposing the Huari urbanism and Tiahuanaco religious iconography.\n\nThe [[Muisca people|Muisca]] were the main indigenous civilization in what is now Colombia. They established the [[Muisca Confederation]] of many clans, or ''[[cacique|cacicazgos]]'', that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers.\n\nOther important Pre-Columbian cultures include: the [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s (in south central Ecuador), [[Chim\u00fa Empire]] (1300\u20131470, Peruvian northern coast), [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and the Aymaran kingdoms (1000\u20131450, Western Bolivia and southern Peru).\nHolding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as ''Tawantin suyu'', and \"the land of the four regions,\" in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the [[Inca Empire]] was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some nine to fourteen million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer [[Inca road system|road system]]. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture.\n\nThe [[Mapuche]] in Central and Southern Chile resisted the European and Chilean settlers, waging the [[Arauco War]] for more than 300 years.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===European colonization===\n{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Vespucci's first voyage, from Letter to Soderini.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut depicting Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s first voyage (1497-98) to the New World, from the first known published edition of Vespucci's 1504 letter to [[Piero Soderini]].]]\n\nIn 1494, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the two great maritime European powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], by which they agreed, with the support of the Pope, that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the two countries.\n\nThe treaty established an imaginary line along a north\u2013south [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde Islands]], roughly 46\u00b0 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (known to comprise most of the South American soil) would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of [[longitude]] were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese expansion of Brazil]] across the meridian.\n\n[[File:Inca-Spanish confrontation.JPG|thumb|The [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Inca\u2013Spanish confrontation]] in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] left thousands of natives dead.]]\n\nBeginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign [[conquistadors]], first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it in colonies.\n\nEuropean infectious diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[typhus]]) \u2013 to which the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native populations]] had no immune resistance&nbsp;\u2013 caused large-scale depopulation of the native population under Spanish control. Systems of forced labor, such as the [[hacienda]]s and mining industry's [[Mita (Inca)|mit'a]] also contributed to the depopulation. After this, African [[Slavery|slaves]], who had developed immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.\n\n[[File:Desembarque de Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral em Porto Seguro em 1500 by Oscar Pereira da Silva (1865\u20131939).jpg|thumb|left|The Portuguese arrival in Brazil on 22 April 1500 was led by [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]].]]\n[[File:Waterkant seen from Suriname river III.JPG|thumb|The Dutch colonial houses in the historic center of [[Paramaribo]], Suriname.]]\n[[File:Plate 6 Provisional Battalion.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the Demerara rebellion in [[British Guiana]] in 1823.]]\n\nThe Spaniards were committed to converting their native subjects to [[Christianity]] and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end; however, many initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as native groups simply blended [[Catholicism]] with their established beliefs and practices. Furthermore, the Spaniards brought their language to the degree they did with their religion, although the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s evangelization in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form.\n\nEventually, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives]] and the Spaniards interbred, forming a [[mestizo]] class. At the beginning, many mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers. After independence, most mestizos had native fathers and European or mestizo mothers.\n\nMany native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers; this included many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America, which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal. Spaniards and Portuguese brought the western European architectural style to the continent, and helped to improve infrastructures like bridges, roads, and the sewer system of the cities they discovered or conquered. They also significantly increased economic and trade relations, not just between the old and new world but between the different South American regions and peoples. Finally, with the expansion of the Portuguese and Spanish languages, many cultures that were previously separated became united through that of Latin American.\n\n[[Guyana]] was first a Dutch, and then a [[British Empire|British colony]], though there was a brief period during the Napoleonic Wars when it was colonized by the French. The country was once partitioned into three parts, each being controlled by one of the colonial powers until the country was finally taken over fully by the British.\n\n===Slavery in South America===\n{{Slavery}}\n{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}\n[[File:Johann Moritz Rugendas in Brazil.jpg|thumb|left|Public flogging of a slave in 19th-century Brazil.]]\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in European plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries. The colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labor during the initial phases of European settlement to maintain the subsistence economy, and natives were often captured by expeditions. The importation of African slaves began midway through the 16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th and 18th centuries. The [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought African slaves primarily to South American colonies, beginning with the Portuguese since 1502.<ref>Anstey, Roger: ''The Atlantic Slave Trade and British abolition, 1760\u20131810''. London: Macmillan, 1975, p. 5.</ref> The main destinations of this phase were the [[Caribbean]] colonies and [[Brazil]], as European nations built up economically slave-dependent colonies in the [[New World]]. Nearly 40% of all African slaves trafficked to the Americas went to Brazil. An estimated 4.9 million slaves from Africa came to Brazil during the period from 1501 to 1866.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vergonha Ainda Maior: Novas informa\u00e7\u00f5es dispon\u00edveis em um enorme banco de dados mostram que a escravid\u00e3o no Brasil foi muito pior do que se sabia antes (|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|website=Veja|accessdate=16 March 2015|language=Portuguese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313000755/http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|archivedate=13 March 2015|df=}}</ref><ref>Stephen D.

In 1750 Portugal abolished native slavery in the colonies because they considered them unfit for labour and began to import even more African slaves. Slaves were brought to the mainland on [[slave ships]], under inhuman conditions and ill-treatment, and those who survived were sold into the slave markets.\n\nAfter independence, all South American countries maintained slavery for some time. The first South American country to abolish slavery was Chile in 1823, Uruguay in 1830, Bolivia in 1831, Colombia and Ecuador in 1851, Argentina in 1853, Peru and Venezuela in 1854, Suriname in 1863, Paraguay in 1869, and in 1888 Brazil was the last South American nation and the last country in [[western world]] to abolish slavery.\n\n===Independence from Spain and Portugal===\n{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence|Independence of Brazil}}\n[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Guayaquil conference]] between [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]]]\n[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|thumb|The proclamation of the [[Independence of Brazil]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]] on 7 September 1822]]\n[[File:Coroa\u00e7ao pedro I 001.jpg|thumb|Coronation of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] as 1st [[Emperor of Brazil]]]]\n[[File:JuraIndependencia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]] swears officially the independence of [[Chile]].]]\n\nThe European [[Peninsular War]] (1807\u20131814), a theater of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], changed the political situation of both the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. First, Napoleon invaded Portugal, but the [[House of Braganza]] avoided capture by [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|escaping to Brazil]]. Napoleon also captured King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], and appointed his own brother instead. This appointment provoked severe popular resistance, which created [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Juntas]] to rule in the name of the captured king.\n\nMany cities in the Spanish colonies, however, considered themselves equally authorized to appoint local Juntas like those of Spain. This began the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] between the patriots, who promoted such autonomy, and the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], who supported Spanish authority over the Americas. The Juntas, in both Spain and the Americas, promoted the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Five years after the beginning of the war, Ferdinand VII returned to the throne and began the [[Absolutist Restoration]] as the royalists got the upper hand in the conflict.\n\nThe independence of South America was secured by [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] (Venezuela) and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] (Argentina), the two most important ''[[Libertadores]]''. Bol\u00edvar led a great uprising in the north, then led his army southward towards [[Lima]], the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Meanwhile, San Mart\u00edn led an army across the Andes Mountains, along with Chilean expatriates, and liberated Chile. He organized a fleet to reach Peru by sea, and sought the military support of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru. The two armies finally met in Guayaquil, [[Ecuador]], where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish Crown and forced its surrender.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil]], [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese King [[Dom Jo\u00e3o VI]], proclaimed the independent [[Kingdom of Brazil]] in 1822, which later became the [[Empire of Brazil]]. Despite the Portuguese loyalties of garrisons in [[Bahia]], [[Cisplatine Province|Cisplatina]] and [[Par\u00e1]], independence was diplomatically accepted by the crown in Portugal in 1825, on condition of a high compensation paid by Brazil mediatized by the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n===Nation-building and fragmentation===\n[[File:Juan Manuel Blanes - El Juramento de los Treinta y Tres Orientales.jpg|thumb|The [[Thirty-Three Orientals]] proclaimed the independence of [[Cisplatine Province]].]]\n[[File:Oscar Pereira da Silva - Cena de Batalha no Sul do Brasil.jpg|thumb|Battle of Fanfa, battle scene in Southern Brazil during the [[Ragamuffin War]]]]\n\nThe newly independent nations began a process of fragmentation, with several civil and international wars. However, it was not as strong as in Central America. Some countries created from provinces of larger countries stayed as such up to modern times (such as Paraguay or Uruguay), while others were reconquered and reincorporated into their former countries (such as the [[Republic of Entre R\u00edos]] and the [[Riograndense Republic]]).\n\nThe first separatist attempt was in 1820 by the Argentine province of [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre R\u00edos]], led by a [[caudillo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilescola.com/historia-da-america/caudilhismo.htm|title=Caudillo}}</ref> In spite of the \"Republic\" in its title, [[Francisco Ram\u00edrez (governor)|General Ram\u00edrez]], its caudillo, never really intended to declare an independent Entre Rios. Rather, he was making a political statement in opposition to the monarchist and centralist ideas that back then permeated [[Buenos Aires]] politics. The \"country\" was reincorporated at the United Provinces in 1821.\n\nIn 1825 the [[Cisplatine Province]] declared its independence from the [[Empire of Brazil]], which led to the [[Cisplatine War]] between the imperials and the Argentine from the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] to control the region. Three years later, the [[United Kingdom]] intervened in the question by proclaiming a tie and creating in the former Cisplatina a new independent country: The [[Oriental Republic of Uruguay]].\n\nLater in 1836, while Brazil was experiencing the chaos of the regency, [[Rio Grande do Sul]] [[Ragamuffin War|proclaimed its independence]] motivated by a tax crisis. With the anticipation of the coronation of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] to the throne of Brazil, the country could stabilize and fight the separatists, which the province of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] had joined in 1839. The Conflict came to an end by a process of compromise by which both [[Riograndense Republic]] and [[Juliana Republic]] were reincorporated as provinces in 1845.<ref>{{Cite web | url= http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/guerra-farrapos.htm | title= Ragamuffin War | last= Day | first= Peter | date= 17 December 1997 | publisher= Brasil Escola | accessdate= 27 March 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070303074424/http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/guerra-farrapos.htm | archivedate= 3 March 2007 | df=  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/revolucao-farroupilha.htm |title= Ragamuffin Revolution |last= Souza |first=Rainer |date=20 January 2002|publisher=RioGrande |accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Peru\u2013Bolivian Confederation]], a short-lived union of Peru and Bolivia, was blocked by Chile in the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836\u20131839) and again during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131883).

Despite the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] and the [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazilian War of Independence]], the new nations quickly began to suffer with internal conflicts and wars among themselves.\n\nIn 1825 the proclamation of independence of Cisplatina led to the [[Cisplatine War]] between historical rivals the [[Empire of Brazil]] and the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], Argentina's predecessor. The result was a stalemate, ending with the British arranging for the independence of Uruguay. Soon after, another Brazilian province proclaimed its independence leading to the [[Ragamuffin War]] which Brazil won.\n\nBetween 1836 and 1839 the [[War of the Confederation]] broke out between the short-lived [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] and [[Chile]], with the support of the [[Argentine Confederation]]. The war was fought mostly in the actual territory of [[Peru]] and ended with a Confederate defeat and the dissolution of the Confederacy and annexation of many territories by Argentina.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Argentine Civil Wars]] plagued Argentina since its independence. The conflict was mainly between those who defended the centralization of power in Buenos Aires and those who defended a confederation. During this period it can be said that \"there were two Argentines\": the [[Argentine Confederation]] and the [[Argentine Republic]]. At the same time the political instability in Uruguay led to the [[Uruguayan Civil War]] among the main political factions of the country. All this instability in the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin|platine region]] interfered with the goals of other countries such as Brazil, which was soon forced to take sides. In 1851 the [[Brazilian Empire]], supporting the centralizing unitarians, and the [[Uruguay|Uruguayan government]] invaded Argentina and deposed the caudillo, [[Juan Manuel Rosas]], who ruled the confederation with an iron hand. Although the [[Platine War]] did not put an end to the political chaos and civil war in Argentina, it brought temporary peace to Uruguay where the [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorados faction]] won, supported by the [[Brazilian Empire]], [[British Empire]], [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] and the [[Unitarian Party]] of Argentina.<ref name=\"Latin America\u2019s Wars\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=khU0sFxgyjMC&pg=RA2-PA1844&dq=lorenzo%20latorre%20uruguay%20president#v=onepage&q=chapter%20twenty-five&f=false|title=Latin America's Wars|first=Robert L.|last=Scheina|date=31 January 2003|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1597974776}}</ref>\n\nPeace lasted only a short time: in 1864 the Uruguayan factions faced each other again in the [[Uruguayan War]]. The [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]] supported by Paraguay started to attack Brazilian and Argentine farmers near the borders. The Empire made an initial attempt to settle the dispute between Blancos and Colorados without success. In 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, the imperial government declared that Brazil's military would begin reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and, for most of its duration, the Uruguayan\u2013Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war which led to the deposition of the ''Blancos'' and the rise of the pro-Brazilian ''Colorados'' to power again. This angered the Paraguayan government, which even before the end of the war invaded Brazil, beginning the biggest and deadliest war in both South American and Latin American histories: the Paraguayan War.\n\nThe Paraguayan War began when the Paraguayan dictator [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez]] ordered the invasion of the Brazilian provinces of [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. His attempt to cross Argentinian territory without Argentinian approval led the pro-Brazilian Argentine government into the war. The pro-Brazilian Uruguayan government showed its support by sending troops. In 1865 the three countries signed the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance]] against Paraguay. At the beginning of the war, the Paraguayans took the lead with several victories, until the Triple Alliance organized to repel the invaders and fight effectively. This was the second [[total war]] experience in the world after the [[American Civil War]]. It was deemed the greatest war effort in the history of all participating countries, taking almost 6 years and ending with the complete devastation of Paraguay. The country lost 40% of its territory to Brazil and Argentina and lost 60% of its population, including 90% of the men. The dictator Lopez was killed in battle and a new government was instituted in alliance with Brazil, which maintained occupation forces in the country until 1876.<ref>{{cite web|language = Portuguese|url= http://www.historiadobrasil.net/guerraparaguai/ |title=A Guerra do Paraguai \u2013 Hist\u00f3ria \u2013 Resumo|last=Borges|first = Fernando Tadeu de Miranda|website=Historiadobrasil.net|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe last South American war in the 19th century was the [[War of the Pacific]] with Bolivia and Peru on one side and Chile on the other. In 1879 the war began with Chilean troops occupying Bolivian ports, followed by Bolivia declaring war on Chile which activated an alliance treaty with Peru. The Bolivians were completely defeated in 1880 and Lima was occupied in 1881. The peace was signed with Peru in 1883 while a truce was signed with Bolivia in 1884.

At one point, the Argentine government was spending a fifth of its entire yearly budget for just two dreadnoughts, a price that did not include later in-service costs, which for the Brazilian dreadnoughts was sixty percent of the initial purchase.<ref>Richard Hough, ''The Big Battleship'' (London: Michael Joseph, 1966), 19. {{oclc|8898108}}.</ref><ref>Robert Scheina, ''Latin America: A Naval History, 1810\u20131987'' (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 1987), 86. {{ISBN|0-87021-295-8}}. {{oclc|15696006}}.</ref>\n\nThe continent became a battlefield of the [[Cold War]] in the late 20th century. Some democratically elected governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay were overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed on [[Operation Condor|inter-state collaboration]]. Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the US Cold War doctrine of \"National Security\" against internal subversion. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Peru suffered from [[Internal conflict in Peru|an internal conflict]].\n\nArgentina and Britain fought the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.\n\nColombia has had an ongoing, though diminished internal conflict, which started in 1964 with the creation of [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] (FARC-EP) and then involved several illegal armed groups of leftist-leaning ideology as well as the private armies of powerful drug lords. Many of these are now defunct, and only a small portion of the ELN remains, along with the stronger, though also greatly reduced, FARC.\n\nRevolutionary movements and right-wing military dictatorships became common after [[World War II]], but since the 1980s, a wave of democratization passed through the continent, and democratic rule is widespread now.<ref>\"The Cambridge History of Latin America\", edited by Leslie Bethell, Cambridge University Press (1995) {{ISBN|0-521-39525-9}}</ref> Nonetheless, allegations of corruption are still very common, and several countries have developed crises which have forced the resignation of their governments, although, on most occasions, regular civilian succession has continued.\n\n[[File:Presidentes unasur (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Presidents of [[UNASUR]] member states at the Second Bras\u00edlia Summit on 23 May 2008.]]\n[[Developing countries' debt|International indebtedness]] turned into a severe problem in the late 1980s, and some countries, despite having strong democracies, have not yet developed political institutions capable of handling such crises without resorting to unorthodox economic policies, as most recently illustrated by Argentina's [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|default]] in the early 21st century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Leslie Bethell|title=Bibliographical Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6tNWbywFXhkC|year=1995|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-39525-0}}</ref>{{POV statement|date=November 2012}} The last twenty years have seen an increased push towards [[Integration of Latin America|regional integration]], with the creation of uniquely South American institutions such as the [[Andean Community]], [[Mercosur]] and [[Unasur]].

The second largest country is Colombia with a population of {{UN_Population|Colombia}}. Argentina is the third most populous country with {{UN_Population|Argentina}}.\n\nWhile Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. The largest cities in South America, by far, are S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Lima, and Bogot\u00e1. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and three of five in the [[Americas]]. Next in size are Caracas, Belo Horizonte, Medellin and Salvador.\n\nFive of the [[List of metropolitan areas in the Americas|top ten metropolitan areas]] are in Brazil. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 4 million and include the [[Greater S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area]], [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area]], and [[Greater Belo Horizonte|Belo Horizonte metropolitan area]]. Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within Brazil, Argentina is host to the second largest metropolitan area by population in South America: the [[Greater Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires metropolitan region]] is above 13 million inhabitants.\n\nSouth America has also been witness to the growth of [[Megalopolis|megapolitan areas]]. In Brazil four megaregions exist including the [[Expanded Metropolitan Complex of S\u00e3o Paulo]] with more than 32 million inhabitants. The others are the Greater Rio, Greater Belo Horizonte and [[Greater Porto Alegre]]. Colombia also has four megaregions which comprise 72% of its population, followed by Venezuela, Argentina and Peru which are also homes of megaregions.\n\nThe top ten largest South American metropolitan areas by population as of 2015, based on national census numbers from each country:\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Metro Area'''\n| '''Population'''\n| '''Area'''\n| '''Country'''\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n| 21,090,792\n| {{convert|7947|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]]\n| 13,693,657\n| {{convert|3830|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Argentina\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro]]\n| 13,131,431\n| {{convert|6744|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Lima metropolitan area|Lima]]\n| 9,904,727\n| {{convert|2819|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Peru\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Metropolitan Area of Bogot\u00e1|Bogot\u00e1]]\n| 9,800,225\n| {{convert|4200|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Colombia\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Santiago Metropolitan Region|Santiago]]\n| 6,683,852\n| {{convert|15403|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Chile\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Belo Horizonte|Belo Horizonte]]\n| 5,829,923\n| {{convert|9467|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Caracas|Caracas]]\n| 5,322,310\n| {{convert|4715|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Venezuela\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Porto Alegre|Porto Alegre]]\n| 4,258,926\n| {{convert|10232|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Bras\u00edlia|Brasilia]]\n| 4,201,737\n| {{convert|56433|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|}\n<small>2015 Census figures.</small>\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of South America|List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (nominal)|List of South American countries by GDP (PPP)}}\n{{update-section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Banco del Sur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rafael Correa]], [[Evo Morales]], [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]], [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]], [[Nicanor Duarte]], and [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] signed the founding charter of the [[Bank of the South]].]]\n[[File:Sao Paulo Stock Exchange.jpg|thumb|left|Trading panel of the [[BM&F Bovespa|S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange]] is the second biggest in the [[Americas]] and 13th in the world.]]\n[[File:Vista Parcial de Santiago de Chile 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Financial center of [[Santiago]], [[Chile]]]]\n[[File:Ariane 5ES liftoff from ELA-3.jpg|thumb|Launch at the [[Kourou Space Center]] in [[French Guiana]]]]\n[[File:Petrobrasbolivia2006.jpg|thumb|[[Refinery]] of Brazilian state-owned [[Petrobras]] in [[Cochabamba]], [[Bolivia]]]]\n[[File:Chuqui001 02.jpg|thumb|[[Chuquicamata]] is the largest [[Open-pit mining|open pit mine]] in the world, near the city of [[Calama, Chile|Calama]] in Chile.]]\n[[File:Apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o KC-390 (15414135738).jpg|thumb|[[Embraer KC-390|KC-390]] is the largest military transport aircraft produced in South America by the Brazilian company [[Embraer]].]]\n[[File:Bodega chakana hacia la monta\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vineyard]] in [[Luj\u00e1n de Cuyo]], province of [[Mendoza, Argentina]]]]\n\nSouth America relies less on the export of both manufactured goods and natural resources than the world average; merchandise exports from the continent were 16% of GDP on an [[nominal GDP|exchange rate]] basis, compared to 25% for the world as a whole.<ref name=wfex/> Brazil (the seventh largest economy in the world and the largest in South America) leads [[List of countries by exports|in terms of merchandise exports]] at $251 billion, followed by Venezuela at $93 billion, Chile at $86 billion, and Argentina at $84 billion.<ref name=wfex/>\n\nSince 1930, the continent has experienced remarkable growth and diversification in most economic sectors. Most agricultural and livestock products are destined for the domestic market and local consumption. However, the export of [[agriculture|agricultural products]] is essential for the [[balance of trade]] in most countries.<ref name=\"Economy\">O Sistema Econ\u00f4mico / Am\u00e9rica do Sul.

The production of staple foods such as vegetables, corn or beans is large, but focused on domestic consumption. Livestock raising for meat exports is important in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Colombia. In tropical regions the most important crops are [[coffee]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[bananas]], mainly in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador. Traditionally, the countries producing [[sugar]] for export are Peru, Guyana and Suriname, and in Brazil, [[sugar cane]] is also used to make [[ethanol]]. On the coast of Peru, northeast and south of Brazil, [[cotton]] is grown. Fifty percent of the South American surface is covered by forests, but timber industries are small and directed to domestic markets. In recent years, however, transnational companies have been settling in the [[Amazon forest|Amazon]] to exploit noble timber destined for export. The Pacific coastal waters of South America are the most important for commercial fishing. The anchovy catch reaches thousands of tons, and tuna is also abundant (Peru is a major exporter). The capture of [[crustaceans]] is remarkable, particularly in northeastern Brazil and Chile.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nOnly Brazil and Argentina are part of the [[G20]] (industrial countries), while only Brazil is part of the [[G8+5]] (the most powerful and influential nations in the world). In the tourism sector, a series of negotiations began in 2005 to promote tourism and increase air connections within the region. [[Punta del Este]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]] and [[Mar del Plata]] are among the most important resorts in South America.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nThe most industrialized countries in South America are Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay respectively. These countries alone account for more than 75 percent of the region's economy and add up to a GDP of more than US$3.0 trillion. Industries in South America began to take on the economies of the region from the 1930s when the [[Great Depression]] in the United States and other countries of the world boosted industrial production in the continent. From that period the region left the agricultural side behind and began to achieve high rates of economic growth that remained until the early 1990s when they slowed due to political instabilities, economic crises and neoliberal policies.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nSince the end of the economic crisis in Brazil and Argentina that occurred in the period from 1998 to 2002, which has led to [[economic recession]], rising unemployment and falling population income, the industrial and service sectors have been recovering rapidly. Chile, Argentina and Brazil have recovered fastest, growing at an average of 5% per year. All of South America after this period has been recovering and showing good signs of economic stability, with controlled [[inflation]] and exchange rates, continuous growth, a decrease in [[social inequality]] and unemployment\u2013factors that favor industry.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nThe main industries are: electronics, textiles, food, automotive, metallurgy, aviation, naval, clothing, beverage, steel, tobacco, timber, chemical, among others. Exports reach almost US$400 billion annually, with Brazil accounting for half of this.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nThe [[Economic inequality|economic gap]] between the rich and poor in most South American nations is larger than on most other continents.

Some of the most famous genres include [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] from Colombia, [[pasillo]] from Colombia and Ecuador, [[samba]], [[bossa nova]] and [[m\u00fasica sertaneja]] from Brazil, and [[tango music|tango]] from Argentina and Uruguay.

In the late 20th century, [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol|Spanish rock]] emerged by young hipsters influenced by British pop and American rock. [[Music of Brazil|Brazil]] has a Portuguese-language pop rock industry as well a great variety of other music genres.  In the central and western regions of Bolivia, Andean and folklore music like [[Diablada]], [[Caporales]] and [[Morenada]] are the most representative of the country, which were originated by European, Aymara and Quechua influences.\n\nThe [[Spanish American literature|literature]] of South America has attracted considerable critical and popular acclaim, especially with the [[Latin American Boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of authors such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] in novels and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Pablo Neruda]] in other genres. The Brazilians [[Machado de Assis]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa]] are widely regarded as the greatest Brazilian writers.\n\nBecause of South America's broad ethnic mix, [[South American cuisine]] has African, South American Indian, South Asian, East Asian, and European influences. [[Bahia]], Brazil, is especially well known for its West African\u2013influenced cuisine. Argentines, Chileans, Uruguayans, Brazilians, Bolivians, and Venezuelans regularly consume wine. People in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Chile, Bolivia and Brazil drink [[mate (beverage)|mate]], an herb which is brewed. The Paraguayan version, [[terere]], differs from other forms of mate in that it is served cold. [[Pisco]] is a liquor distilled from grapes in Peru and Chile. Peruvian cuisine mixes elements from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, African, Arab, Andean, and Amazonic food.\n\n=== Plastic arts ===\n[[File:Fernando Botero, Bird (1990), Singapore - 20040616.jpg|thumb|''Bird'' (Singapore), sculpture of [[Fernando Botero]]]]\nThe artist [[Oswaldo Guayasam\u00edn]] (1919\u20131999) from [[Ecuador]], represented with his painting style the feeling of the peoples of Latin America<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.andes.info.ec/es/noticias/guayasamin-pintor-ecuatoriano-retrato-sufrimiento-pueblos-latinoamericanos.html|title=Guayasam\u00edn, el pintor ecuatoriano que retrat\u00f3 los sufrimientos latinoamericanos|last=|first=|date=|work=Andes, Agencia de Noticias|access-date=}}</ref> highlighting social injustices in various parts of the world.

Brazil holds the record at the FIFA World Cup with five titles in total. Argentina and Uruguay have two titles each. So far four South American nations have hosted the tournament including the first edition in Uruguay (1930). The other three were Brazil (1950, 2014), Chile (1962), and Argentina (1978).\n\nSouth America is home to the longest running international football tournament; the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]], which has been regularly contested since 1916. Uruguay won the Copa Am\u00e9rica a record 15 times, surpassing hosts Argentina in 2011 to reach 15 titles (they were previously equal at 14 titles each during the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica).\n\nAlso, in South America, a multi-sport event, the [[South American Games]], are held every four years. The first edition was held in [[La Paz]] in 1978 and the most recent took place in [[Santiago]] in 2014.\n\n[[South American Cricket Championship]] is an international [[limited-overs cricket]] tournament played since 1995 featuring national teams from [[Sports in South America|South America]] and certain other invited sides including teams from North America, currently played annually but until 2013 was usually played every two seasons.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n[[File:Molino de viento (moderno) 2014-09-21 (3).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jep\u00edrachi wind farm in the [[Guajira Peninsula]].]]\n===Energy===\nDue to the diversity of [[topography]] and pluviometric precipitation conditions, the region's water resources vary enormously in different areas. In the [[Andes]], navigation possibilities are limited, except for the Magdalena River, [[Lake Titicaca]] and the lakes of the southern regions of Chile and Argentina. Irrigation is an important factor for agriculture from northwestern Peru to Patagonia. Less than 10% of the known electrical potential of the Andes had been used until the mid-1960s.\n\nThe [[Brazilian Highlands]] has a much higher [[hydroelectric]] potential than the [[Andes|Andean region]] and its possibilities of exploitation are greater due to the existence of several large rivers with high margins and the occurrence of great differences forming huge cataracts, such as those of Paulo Afonso, Igua\u00e7u and others. The [[Amazon River]] system has about 13,000&nbsp;km of waterways, but its possibilities for hydroelectric use are still unknown.\n\nMost of the continent's energy is generated through [[hydroelectric power plants]], but there is also an important share of [[thermoelectric]] and [[wind energy]]. Brazil and Argentina are the only South American countries that generate [[nuclear power]], each with two [[nuclear power plants]]. In 1991 these countries signed a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement.\n\n{{wide image|Itaipu D\u00e9cembre 2007 - Vue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.jpg|1500px|Panoramic view of the [[Itaipu Dam]], the largest of the world in energy production.}}\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Ruta Panamericana Buenos Aires Florida.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stretch of the [[Pan-American Highway]] in Argentina]]\n[[File:Puerto-del-callao.jpg|thumb|The Port of Callao in Lima|alt=]]\n[[File:L\u00ednea Roja de Mi Telef\u00e9rico en La Paz, Bolivia.jpg|thumb|The La Paz cable car system in Bolivia is home to both the longest and highest urban cable car network in the world.]]\n\nSouth American transportation systems are still deficient, with low kilometric densities. The region has about 1,700,000&nbsp;km of [[highways]] and 100,000&nbsp;km of [[railways]], which are concentrated in the coastal strip, and the interior is still devoid of communication.\n\nOnly two railroads are continental: the Transandina, which connects [[Buenos Aires]], in Argentina to [[Valpara\u00edso]], in Chile, and the Brazil\u2013Bolivia Railroad, which makes it the connection between the port of [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]] in Brazil and the city of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], in Bolivia. In addition, there is the [[Pan-American Highway]], which crosses the Andean countries from north to south, although some stretches are unfinished.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=88271|title=A Gap in the Andes : Image of the Day|date=2 April 2015|website=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=22 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTwo areas of greater density occur in the railway sector: the platinum network, which develops around the [[Platine region]], largely belonging to Argentina, with more than 45,000&nbsp;km in length; And the [[Southeast Brazil]] network, which mainly serves the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|state of S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Minas Gerais]]. Brazil and Argentina also stand out in the road sector. In addition to the modern roads that extend through northern Argentina and south-east and south of Brazil, a vast road complex aims to link [[Bras\u00edlia]], the federal capital, to the South, Southeast, Northeast and Northern regions of Brazil.\n\nThe Port of Callao is the main port of Peru.\nSouth America has one of the largest bays of navigable inland waterways in the world, represented mainly by the [[Amazon basin]], the [[Platine basin]], the S\u00e3o Francisco and the Orinoco basins, Brazil having about 54,000&nbsp;km navigable, while Argentina has 6,500&nbsp;km and Venezuela, 1,200&nbsp;km.\n\nThe two main merchant fleets also belong to Brazil and Argentina. The following are those of Chile, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia. The largest ports in commercial movement are those of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]], [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], [[Valpara\u00edso]], [[Recife]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Montevideo]], [[Paranagu\u00e1]], [[Rio Grande]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Bel\u00e9m]] and [[Maracaibo]].\n\nIn South America, [[commercial aviation]] has a magnificent expansion field, which has one of the largest traffic density lines in the world, Rio de Janeiro\u2013S\u00e3o Paulo, and large airports, such as [[S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Congonhas Airport|Congonhas]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport|S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International]] and [[Viracopos International Airport|Viracopos]] (S\u00e3o Paulo), [[Rio de Janeiro\u2013Gale\u00e3o International Airport|Rio de Janeiro International]] and [[Santos Dumont Airport|Santos Dumont]] (Rio de Janeiro), [[El Dorado International Airport|El Dorado]] (Bogot\u00e1), [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Ezeiza]] (Buenos Aires), [[Tancredo Neves International Airport]] (Belo Horizonte), [[Afonso Pena International Airport|Curitiba International Airport]] (Curitiba), Brasilia, Caracas, Montevideo, Lima, [[Viru Viru International Airport]] (Santa Cruz de la Sierra), Recife, Salvador, Salgado Filho International Airport (Porto Alegre), Fortaleza, Manaus and Bel\u00e9m.\n\nThe main public transport in major cities is the bus.

These resources found in South America have brought high income to its countries especially in times of war or of rapid economic growth by industrialized countries elsewhere. However, the concentration in producing one major export [[commodity]] often has hindered the development of diversified economies. The fluctuation in the price of commodities in the international markets has led historically to major highs and lows in the economies of South American states, often causing extreme political instability. This is leading to efforts to diversify production to drive away from staying as economies dedicated to one major export.\n\nSouth America is one of the most biodiverse continents on earth. South America is home to many interesting and unique species of animals including the [[llama]], [[anaconda]], [[piranha]], [[jaguar]], [[vicu\u00f1a]], and [[tapir]].

The northern and eastern parts of the Argentine pampas have a [[Subtropics|humid subtropical climate]] with dry winters and humid summers of the Chinese type, while the western and eastern ranges have a subtropical climate of the dinaric type. At the highest points of the Andean region, climates are colder than the ones occurring at the highest point of the Norwegian fjords. In the Andean plateaus, the warm climate prevails, although it is tempered by the altitude, while in the coastal strip, there is an equatorial climate of the Guinean type. From this point until the north of the Chilean coast appear, successively, [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean oceanic climate]], temperate of the Breton type and, already in [[Tierra del Fuego]], cold climate of the Siberian type.<ref name=\"Climate\"/>\n\nThe distribution of rainfall is related to the regime of winds and air masses. In most of the [[tropical region]] east of the Andes, winds blowing from the northeast, east and southeast carry moisture from the Atlantic, causing abundant rainfall. However, due to a consistently strong [[wind shear]] and a weak [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]], [[South Atlantic tropical cyclone]]s are rare.<ref>{{cite web\n | url =http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/G6.html\n | title =Why doesn't the South Atlantic Ocean experience tropical cyclones?\n | last =Landsea\n | first =Chris\n | date =13 July 2005\n | website =Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorlogical Laboratory\n | publisher =National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration\n | access-date =9 June 2018\n | quote = }}</ref> In the [[Los Llanos (South America)|Orinoco Llanos]] and in the [[The Guianas|Guianas plateau]], the precipitation levels go from moderate to high.

The moderately dry conditions of the Chaco oppose the intense rainfall of the eastern region of Paraguay. In the [[semiarid]] coast of the Brazilian Northeast the rains are linked to a monsoon regime.<ref name=\"Climate\"/>\n\nImportant factors in the determination of climates are sea currents, such as the current Humboldt and [[Falklands]]. The equatorial current of the South Atlantic strikes the coast of the Northeast and there is divided into two others: the current of Brazil and a coastal current that flows to the northwest towards the [[Antilles]], where there it moves towards northeast course thus forming the most Important and famous ocean current in the world, the [[Gulf Stream]].<ref name=\"Climate\"/><ref name=\"Know.net\">{{cite web |url=http://www.knoow.net/ciencterravida/geografia/correntegolfo.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=26 January 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411062149/http://www.knoow.net/ciencterravida/geografia/correntegolfo.htm |archivedate=11 April 2015 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of South America}}\n\n===Prehistory===\n{{further|History of South America#Pre-Columbian era}}\n[[File:SantaCruz-CuevaManos-P2210651b.jpg|thumb|The prehistoric [[Cueva de las Manos]], or \"Cave of the Hands\", in Argentina]]\nSouth America is believed to have been joined with Africa from the late [[Paleozoic Era]] to the early [[Mesozoic Era]], until the [[supercontinent]] [[Pangaea]] began to rift and break apart about 225 million years ago. Therefore, South America and Africa share similar fossils and rock layers.\n\nSouth America is thought to have been first inhabited by humans when people were crossing the [[Beringia|Bering Land Bridge]] (now the [[Bering Strait]]) at least 15,000 years ago from the territory that is present-day Russia. They migrated south through North America, and eventually reached South America through the [[Isthmus of Panama]].\n\nThe first evidence for the existence of the human race in South America dates back to about 9000 BC, when [[Squash (plant)|squashes]], [[chili pepper]]s and [[bean]]s began to be cultivated for food in the highlands of the [[Amazon Basin]]. Pottery evidence further suggests that [[manioc]], which remains a [[staple food]] today, was being cultivated as early as 2000 BC.<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\">O'Brien, Patrick.

New York: Oxford University Press, 2005. p. 25</ref>\n\nBy 2000 BC, many [[agrarian society|agrarian]] communities had been settled throughout the [[Andes]] and the surrounding regions. Fishing became a widespread practice along the coast, helping establish fish as a primary source of food. Irrigation systems were also developed at this time, which aided in the rise of an [[agrarian society]].<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\"/>\n\nSouth American cultures began domesticating [[llama]]s, [[vicu\u00f1a]]s, [[guanaco]]s, and [[alpaca]]s in the highlands of the Andes circa 3500 BC. Besides their use as sources of meat and wool, these animals were used for transportation of goods.<ref name=\"OBrienP-Oxford_Atlas\"/>\n\n===Pre-Columbian civilizations===\n{{Main|Pre-Columbian era#South America}}\n[[File:Machu Picchu, Per\u00fa, 2015-07-30, DD 39.JPG|alt=|thumb|The Inca estate of [[Machu Picchu]], [[Peru]] is one of the [[New Seven Wonders of the World#Winners|New Seven Wonders of the World]].]]\n\nThe rise of plant growing and the subsequent appearance of permanent human settlements allowed for the multiple and overlapping beginnings of civilizations in South America.\n\nOne of the earliest known South American civilizations was at [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]], on the central [[Peru]]vian coast. Though a pre-ceramic culture, the monumental architecture of Norte Chico is contemporaneous with the pyramids of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Norte Chico governing class established a trade network and developed agriculture then followed by [[Chavin culture|Chav\u00edn]] by 900 BC, according to some estimates and archaeological finds. Artifacts were found at a site called [[Chav\u00edn de Huantar]] in modern Peru at an elevation of {{convert|3177|m|sp=us||}}. Chav\u00edn civilization spanned 900 BC to 300 BC.\n\nIn the central coast of Peru, around the beginning of the 1st millennium AD, [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] (100 BC&nbsp;\u2013 700 AD, at the northern coast of Peru), [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] and [[Nazca culture|Nazca]] (400 BC&nbsp;\u2013 800 AD, Peru) cultures flourished with centralized states with permanent militia improving agriculture through [[irrigation]] and new styles of ceramic art. At the [[Altiplano]], Tiahuanaco or [[Tiwanaku]] (100 BC&nbsp;\u2013 1200 AD, Bolivia) managed a large commercial network based on religion.\n\nAround the 7th century, both Tiahuanaco and Wari or [[Wari culture|Huari]] Empire (600\u20131200, Central and northern Peru) expanded its influence to all the Andean region, imposing the Huari urbanism and Tiahuanaco religious iconography.\n\nThe [[Muisca people|Muisca]] were the main indigenous civilization in what is now Colombia. They established the [[Muisca Confederation]] of many clans, or ''[[cacique|cacicazgos]]'', that had a free trade network among themselves. They were goldsmiths and farmers.\n\nOther important Pre-Columbian cultures include: the [[Ca\u00f1ari]]s (in south central Ecuador), [[Chim\u00fa Empire]] (1300\u20131470, Peruvian northern coast), [[Chachapoyas culture|Chachapoyas]], and the Aymaran kingdoms (1000\u20131450, Western Bolivia and southern Peru).\nHolding their capital at the great city of [[Cusco]], the [[Inca civilization]] dominated the Andes region from 1438 to 1533. Known as ''Tawantin suyu'', and \"the land of the four regions,\" in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the [[Inca Empire]] was highly distinct and developed. Inca rule extended to nearly a hundred linguistic or ethnic communities, some nine to fourteen million people connected by a 25,000 kilometer [[Inca road system|road system]]. Cities were built with precise, unmatched stonework, constructed over many levels of mountain terrain. [[Terrace farming]] was a useful form of agriculture.\n\nThe [[Mapuche]] in Central and Southern Chile resisted the European and Chilean settlers, waging the [[Arauco War]] for more than 300 years.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n===European colonization===\n{{Main|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\n[[File:Vespucci's first voyage, from Letter to Soderini.jpg|thumb|left|Woodcut depicting Italian explorer [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s first voyage (1497-98) to the New World, from the first known published edition of Vespucci's 1504 letter to [[Piero Soderini]].]]\n\nIn 1494, [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the two great maritime European powers of that time, on the expectation of new lands being discovered in the west, signed the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]], by which they agreed, with the support of the Pope, that all the land outside Europe should be an exclusive [[duopoly]] between the two countries.\n\nThe treaty established an imaginary line along a north\u2013south [[meridian (geography)|meridian]] 370 [[league (unit)|leagues]] west of the [[Cape Verde Islands]], roughly 46\u00b0 37' W. In terms of the treaty, all land to the west of the line (known to comprise most of the South American soil) would belong to Spain, and all land to the east, to Portugal. As accurate measurements of [[longitude]] were impossible at that time, the line was not strictly enforced, resulting in a [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese expansion of Brazil]] across the meridian.\n\n[[File:Inca-Spanish confrontation.JPG|thumb|The [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Inca\u2013Spanish confrontation]] in the [[Battle of Cajamarca]] left thousands of natives dead.]]\n\nBeginning in the 1530s, the people and natural resources of South America were repeatedly exploited by foreign [[conquistadors]], first from Spain and later from Portugal. These competing colonial nations claimed the land and resources as their own and divided it in colonies.\n\nEuropean infectious diseases ([[smallpox]], [[influenza]], [[measles]], and [[typhus]]) \u2013 to which the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|native populations]] had no immune resistance&nbsp;\u2013 caused large-scale depopulation of the native population under Spanish control. Systems of forced labor, such as the [[hacienda]]s and mining industry's [[Mita (Inca)|mit'a]] also contributed to the depopulation. After this, African [[Slavery|slaves]], who had developed immunities to these diseases, were quickly brought in to replace them.\n\n[[File:Desembarque de Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral em Porto Seguro em 1500 by Oscar Pereira da Silva (1865\u20131939).jpg|thumb|left|The Portuguese arrival in Brazil on 22 April 1500 was led by [[Pedro \u00c1lvares Cabral]].]]\n[[File:Waterkant seen from Suriname river III.JPG|thumb|The Dutch colonial houses in the historic center of [[Paramaribo]], Suriname.]]\n[[File:Plate 6 Provisional Battalion.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the Demerara rebellion in [[British Guiana]] in 1823.]]\n\nThe Spaniards were committed to converting their native subjects to [[Christianity]] and were quick to purge any native cultural practices that hindered this end; however, many initial attempts at this were only partially successful, as native groups simply blended [[Catholicism]] with their established beliefs and practices. Furthermore, the Spaniards brought their language to the degree they did with their religion, although the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s evangelization in [[Quechua language|Quechua]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], and [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]] actually contributed to the continuous use of these native languages albeit only in the oral form.\n\nEventually, the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|natives]] and the Spaniards interbred, forming a [[mestizo]] class. At the beginning, many mestizos of the Andean region were offspring of Amerindian mothers and Spanish fathers. After independence, most mestizos had native fathers and European or mestizo mothers.\n\nMany native artworks were considered pagan idols and destroyed by Spanish explorers; this included many gold and silver sculptures and other artifacts found in South America, which were melted down before their transport to Spain or Portugal. Spaniards and Portuguese brought the western European architectural style to the continent, and helped to improve infrastructures like bridges, roads, and the sewer system of the cities they discovered or conquered. They also significantly increased economic and trade relations, not just between the old and new world but between the different South American regions and peoples. Finally, with the expansion of the Portuguese and Spanish languages, many cultures that were previously separated became united through that of Latin American.\n\n[[Guyana]] was first a Dutch, and then a [[British Empire|British colony]], though there was a brief period during the Napoleonic Wars when it was colonized by the French. The country was once partitioned into three parts, each being controlled by one of the colonial powers until the country was finally taken over fully by the British.\n\n===Slavery in South America===\n{{Slavery}}\n{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}\n[[File:Johann Moritz Rugendas in Brazil.jpg|thumb|left|Public flogging of a slave in 19th-century Brazil.]]\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in European plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries. The colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labor during the initial phases of European settlement to maintain the subsistence economy, and natives were often captured by expeditions. The importation of African slaves began midway through the 16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th and 18th centuries. The [[Atlantic slave trade]] brought African slaves primarily to South American colonies, beginning with the Portuguese since 1502.<ref>Anstey, Roger: ''The Atlantic Slave Trade and British abolition, 1760\u20131810''. London: Macmillan, 1975, p. 5.</ref> The main destinations of this phase were the [[Caribbean]] colonies and [[Brazil]], as European nations built up economically slave-dependent colonies in the [[New World]]. Nearly 40% of all African slaves trafficked to the Americas went to Brazil. An estimated 4.9 million slaves from Africa came to Brazil during the period from 1501 to 1866.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vergonha Ainda Maior: Novas informa\u00e7\u00f5es dispon\u00edveis em um enorme banco de dados mostram que a escravid\u00e3o no Brasil foi muito pior do que se sabia antes (|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|website=Veja|accessdate=16 March 2015|language=Portuguese|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313000755/http://veja.abril.com.br/blog/ricardo-setti/tema-livre/vergonha-ainda-maior-novas-informacoes-disponiveis-em-um-enorme-banco-de-dados-mostram-que-a-escravidao-no-brasil-foi-muito-pior-do-que-se-sabia-antes/|archivedate=13 March 2015|df=}}</ref><ref>Stephen D.

In 1750 Portugal abolished native slavery in the colonies because they considered them unfit for labour and began to import even more African slaves. Slaves were brought to the mainland on [[slave ships]], under inhuman conditions and ill-treatment, and those who survived were sold into the slave markets.\n\nAfter independence, all South American countries maintained slavery for some time. The first South American country to abolish slavery was Chile in 1823, Uruguay in 1830, Bolivia in 1831, Colombia and Ecuador in 1851, Argentina in 1853, Peru and Venezuela in 1854, Suriname in 1863, Paraguay in 1869, and in 1888 Brazil was the last South American nation and the last country in [[western world]] to abolish slavery.\n\n===Independence from Spain and Portugal===\n{{Main|Spanish American wars of independence|Independence of Brazil}}\n[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Guayaquil conference]] between [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] and [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]]]]\n[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|thumb|The proclamation of the [[Independence of Brazil]] by [[Pedro I of Brazil|Prince Pedro]] on 7 September 1822]]\n[[File:Coroa\u00e7ao pedro I 001.jpg|thumb|Coronation of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] as 1st [[Emperor of Brazil]]]]\n[[File:JuraIndependencia.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bernardo O'Higgins]] swears officially the independence of [[Chile]].]]\n\nThe European [[Peninsular War]] (1807\u20131814), a theater of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], changed the political situation of both the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. First, Napoleon invaded Portugal, but the [[House of Braganza]] avoided capture by [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|escaping to Brazil]]. Napoleon also captured King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain]], and appointed his own brother instead. This appointment provoked severe popular resistance, which created [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Juntas]] to rule in the name of the captured king.\n\nMany cities in the Spanish colonies, however, considered themselves equally authorized to appoint local Juntas like those of Spain. This began the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] between the patriots, who promoted such autonomy, and the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalists]], who supported Spanish authority over the Americas. The Juntas, in both Spain and the Americas, promoted the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Five years after the beginning of the war, Ferdinand VII returned to the throne and began the [[Absolutist Restoration]] as the royalists got the upper hand in the conflict.\n\nThe independence of South America was secured by [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] (Venezuela) and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] (Argentina), the two most important ''[[Libertadores]]''. Bol\u00edvar led a great uprising in the north, then led his army southward towards [[Lima]], the capital of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]]. Meanwhile, San Mart\u00edn led an army across the Andes Mountains, along with Chilean expatriates, and liberated Chile. He organized a fleet to reach Peru by sea, and sought the military support of various rebels from the Viceroyalty of Peru. The two armies finally met in Guayaquil, [[Ecuador]], where they cornered the Royal Army of the Spanish Crown and forced its surrender.\n\nIn the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves|Portuguese Kingdom of Brazil]], [[Dom Pedro I]] (also Pedro IV of Portugal), son of the Portuguese King [[Dom Jo\u00e3o VI]], proclaimed the independent [[Kingdom of Brazil]] in 1822, which later became the [[Empire of Brazil]]. Despite the Portuguese loyalties of garrisons in [[Bahia]], [[Cisplatine Province|Cisplatina]] and [[Par\u00e1]], independence was diplomatically accepted by the crown in Portugal in 1825, on condition of a high compensation paid by Brazil mediatized by the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n===Nation-building and fragmentation===\n[[File:Juan Manuel Blanes - El Juramento de los Treinta y Tres Orientales.jpg|thumb|The [[Thirty-Three Orientals]] proclaimed the independence of [[Cisplatine Province]].]]\n[[File:Oscar Pereira da Silva - Cena de Batalha no Sul do Brasil.jpg|thumb|Battle of Fanfa, battle scene in Southern Brazil during the [[Ragamuffin War]]]]\n\nThe newly independent nations began a process of fragmentation, with several civil and international wars. However, it was not as strong as in Central America. Some countries created from provinces of larger countries stayed as such up to modern times (such as Paraguay or Uruguay), while others were reconquered and reincorporated into their former countries (such as the [[Republic of Entre R\u00edos]] and the [[Riograndense Republic]]).\n\nThe first separatist attempt was in 1820 by the Argentine province of [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre R\u00edos]], led by a [[caudillo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brasilescola.com/historia-da-america/caudilhismo.htm|title=Caudillo}}</ref> In spite of the \"Republic\" in its title, [[Francisco Ram\u00edrez (governor)|General Ram\u00edrez]], its caudillo, never really intended to declare an independent Entre Rios. Rather, he was making a political statement in opposition to the monarchist and centralist ideas that back then permeated [[Buenos Aires]] politics. The \"country\" was reincorporated at the United Provinces in 1821.\n\nIn 1825 the [[Cisplatine Province]] declared its independence from the [[Empire of Brazil]], which led to the [[Cisplatine War]] between the imperials and the Argentine from the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]] to control the region. Three years later, the [[United Kingdom]] intervened in the question by proclaiming a tie and creating in the former Cisplatina a new independent country: The [[Oriental Republic of Uruguay]].\n\nLater in 1836, while Brazil was experiencing the chaos of the regency, [[Rio Grande do Sul]] [[Ragamuffin War|proclaimed its independence]] motivated by a tax crisis. With the anticipation of the coronation of [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] to the throne of Brazil, the country could stabilize and fight the separatists, which the province of [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] had joined in 1839. The Conflict came to an end by a process of compromise by which both [[Riograndense Republic]] and [[Juliana Republic]] were reincorporated as provinces in 1845.<ref>{{Cite web | url= http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/guerra-farrapos.htm | title= Ragamuffin War | last= Day | first= Peter | date= 17 December 1997 | publisher= Brasil Escola | accessdate= 27 March 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070303074424/http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/guerra-farrapos.htm | archivedate= 3 March 2007 | df=  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.brasilescola.com/historiab/revolucao-farroupilha.htm |title= Ragamuffin Revolution |last= Souza |first=Rainer |date=20 January 2002|publisher=RioGrande |accessdate=27 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Peru\u2013Bolivian Confederation]], a short-lived union of Peru and Bolivia, was blocked by Chile in the [[War of the Confederation]] (1836\u20131839) and again during the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u20131883).

Despite the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] and the [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazilian War of Independence]], the new nations quickly began to suffer with internal conflicts and wars among themselves.\n\nIn 1825 the proclamation of independence of Cisplatina led to the [[Cisplatine War]] between historical rivals the [[Empire of Brazil]] and the [[United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata]], Argentina's predecessor. The result was a stalemate, ending with the British arranging for the independence of Uruguay. Soon after, another Brazilian province proclaimed its independence leading to the [[Ragamuffin War]] which Brazil won.\n\nBetween 1836 and 1839 the [[War of the Confederation]] broke out between the short-lived [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] and [[Chile]], with the support of the [[Argentine Confederation]]. The war was fought mostly in the actual territory of [[Peru]] and ended with a Confederate defeat and the dissolution of the Confederacy and annexation of many territories by Argentina.\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Argentine Civil Wars]] plagued Argentina since its independence. The conflict was mainly between those who defended the centralization of power in Buenos Aires and those who defended a confederation. During this period it can be said that \"there were two Argentines\": the [[Argentine Confederation]] and the [[Argentine Republic]]. At the same time the political instability in Uruguay led to the [[Uruguayan Civil War]] among the main political factions of the country. All this instability in the [[R\u00edo de la Plata Basin|platine region]] interfered with the goals of other countries such as Brazil, which was soon forced to take sides. In 1851 the [[Brazilian Empire]], supporting the centralizing unitarians, and the [[Uruguay|Uruguayan government]] invaded Argentina and deposed the caudillo, [[Juan Manuel Rosas]], who ruled the confederation with an iron hand. Although the [[Platine War]] did not put an end to the political chaos and civil war in Argentina, it brought temporary peace to Uruguay where the [[Colorado Party (Uruguay)|Colorados faction]] won, supported by the [[Brazilian Empire]], [[British Empire]], [[Second French Empire|French Empire]] and the [[Unitarian Party]] of Argentina.<ref name=\"Latin America\u2019s Wars\">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=khU0sFxgyjMC&pg=RA2-PA1844&dq=lorenzo%20latorre%20uruguay%20president#v=onepage&q=chapter%20twenty-five&f=false|title=Latin America's Wars|first=Robert L.|last=Scheina|date=31 January 2003|publisher=Potomac Books, Inc.|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1597974776}}</ref>\n\nPeace lasted only a short time: in 1864 the Uruguayan factions faced each other again in the [[Uruguayan War]]. The [[National Party (Uruguay)|Blancos]] supported by Paraguay started to attack Brazilian and Argentine farmers near the borders. The Empire made an initial attempt to settle the dispute between Blancos and Colorados without success. In 1864, after a Brazilian ultimatum was refused, the imperial government declared that Brazil's military would begin reprisals. Brazil declined to acknowledge a formal state of war, and, for most of its duration, the Uruguayan\u2013Brazilian armed conflict was an undeclared war which led to the deposition of the ''Blancos'' and the rise of the pro-Brazilian ''Colorados'' to power again. This angered the Paraguayan government, which even before the end of the war invaded Brazil, beginning the biggest and deadliest war in both South American and Latin American histories: the Paraguayan War.\n\nThe Paraguayan War began when the Paraguayan dictator [[Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez]] ordered the invasion of the Brazilian provinces of [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. His attempt to cross Argentinian territory without Argentinian approval led the pro-Brazilian Argentine government into the war. The pro-Brazilian Uruguayan government showed its support by sending troops. In 1865 the three countries signed the [[Treaty of the Triple Alliance]] against Paraguay. At the beginning of the war, the Paraguayans took the lead with several victories, until the Triple Alliance organized to repel the invaders and fight effectively. This was the second [[total war]] experience in the world after the [[American Civil War]]. It was deemed the greatest war effort in the history of all participating countries, taking almost 6 years and ending with the complete devastation of Paraguay. The country lost 40% of its territory to Brazil and Argentina and lost 60% of its population, including 90% of the men. The dictator Lopez was killed in battle and a new government was instituted in alliance with Brazil, which maintained occupation forces in the country until 1876.<ref>{{cite web|language = Portuguese|url= http://www.historiadobrasil.net/guerraparaguai/ |title=A Guerra do Paraguai \u2013 Hist\u00f3ria \u2013 Resumo|last=Borges|first = Fernando Tadeu de Miranda|website=Historiadobrasil.net|accessdate=}}</ref>\n\nThe last South American war in the 19th century was the [[War of the Pacific]] with Bolivia and Peru on one side and Chile on the other. In 1879 the war began with Chilean troops occupying Bolivian ports, followed by Bolivia declaring war on Chile which activated an alliance treaty with Peru. The Bolivians were completely defeated in 1880 and Lima was occupied in 1881. The peace was signed with Peru in 1883 while a truce was signed with Bolivia in 1884.

Some democratically elected governments of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay and Paraguay were overthrown or displaced by military dictatorships in the 1960s and 1970s. To curtail opposition, their governments detained tens of thousands of [[political prisoner]]s, many of whom were tortured and/or killed on [[Operation Condor|inter-state collaboration]]. Economically, they began a transition to [[neoliberal]] economic policies. They placed their own actions within the US Cold War doctrine of \"National Security\" against internal subversion.

There are several areas of sparse demographics such as [[tropical forest]]s, the [[Atacama Desert]] and the icy portions of [[Patagonia]]. On the other hand, the continent presents regions of high population density, such as the great urban centers. The population is formed by descendants of Europeans (mainly [[Spaniards]], [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and [[Italians]]), [[Africans]] and [[indigenous peoples]]. There is a high percentage of [[mestizos]] that vary greatly in composition by place. There is also a minor population of [[Asians]], especially in Brazil.

At least three South American indigenous languages (Quechua, Aymara, and Guarani) are recognized along with Spanish as national languages.\n\nOther languages found in South America include [[Caribbean Hindustani|Hindustani]] and [[Javanese language|Javanese]] in Suriname; [[Italian language|Italian]] in Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Venezuela; and [[German language|German]] in certain pockets of Argentina and Brazil.

Argentina is the third most populous country with {{UN_Population|Argentina}}.\n\nWhile Brazil, Argentina, and Colombia maintain the largest populations, large city populations are not restricted to those nations. The largest cities in South America, by far, are S\u00e3o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Buenos Aires, Santiago, Lima, and Bogot\u00e1. These cities are the only cities on the continent to exceed eight million, and three of five in the [[Americas]]. Next in size are Caracas, Belo Horizonte, Medellin and Salvador.\n\nFive of the [[List of metropolitan areas in the Americas|top ten metropolitan areas]] are in Brazil. These metropolitan areas all have a population of above 4 million and include the [[Greater S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo metropolitan area]], [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area]], and [[Greater Belo Horizonte|Belo Horizonte metropolitan area]]. Whilst the majority of the largest metropolitan areas are within Brazil, Argentina is host to the second largest metropolitan area by population in South America: the [[Greater Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires metropolitan region]] is above 13 million inhabitants.\n\nSouth America has also been witness to the growth of [[Megalopolis|megapolitan areas]]. In Brazil four megaregions exist including the [[Expanded Metropolitan Complex of S\u00e3o Paulo]] with more than 32 million inhabitants. The others are the Greater Rio, Greater Belo Horizonte and [[Greater Porto Alegre]]. Colombia also has four megaregions which comprise 72% of its population, followed by Venezuela, Argentina and Peru which are also homes of megaregions.\n\nThe top ten largest South American metropolitan areas by population as of 2015, based on national census numbers from each country:\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| '''Metro Area'''\n| '''Population'''\n| '''Area'''\n| '''Country'''\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater S\u00e3o Paulo|S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n| 21,090,792\n| {{convert|7947|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Buenos Aires|Buenos Aires]]\n| 13,693,657\n| {{convert|3830|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Argentina\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro]]\n| 13,131,431\n| {{convert|6744|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Lima metropolitan area|Lima]]\n| 9,904,727\n| {{convert|2819|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Peru\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Metropolitan Area of Bogot\u00e1|Bogot\u00e1]]\n| 9,800,225\n| {{convert|4200|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Colombia\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Santiago Metropolitan Region|Santiago]]\n| 6,683,852\n| {{convert|15403|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Chile\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Belo Horizonte|Belo Horizonte]]\n| 5,829,923\n| {{convert|9467|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Caracas|Caracas]]\n| 5,322,310\n| {{convert|4715|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Venezuela\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Greater Porto Alegre|Porto Alegre]]\n| 4,258,926\n| {{convert|10232|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\"\n| [[Bras\u00edlia|Brasilia]]\n| 4,201,737\n| {{convert|56433|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}\n| Brazil\n|}\n<small>2015 Census figures.</small>\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of South America|List of Latin American and Caribbean countries by GDP (nominal)|List of South American countries by GDP (PPP)}}\n{{update-section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Banco del Sur.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rafael Correa]], [[Evo Morales]], [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]], [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]], [[Nicanor Duarte]], and [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] signed the founding charter of the [[Bank of the South]].]]\n[[File:Sao Paulo Stock Exchange.jpg|thumb|left|Trading panel of the [[BM&F Bovespa|S\u00e3o Paulo Stock Exchange]] is the second biggest in the [[Americas]] and 13th in the world.]]\n[[File:Vista Parcial de Santiago de Chile 2013.jpg|thumb|left|Financial center of [[Santiago]], [[Chile]]]]\n[[File:Ariane 5ES liftoff from ELA-3.jpg|thumb|Launch at the [[Kourou Space Center]] in [[French Guiana]]]]\n[[File:Petrobrasbolivia2006.jpg|thumb|[[Refinery]] of Brazilian state-owned [[Petrobras]] in [[Cochabamba]], [[Bolivia]]]]\n[[File:Chuqui001 02.jpg|thumb|[[Chuquicamata]] is the largest [[Open-pit mining|open pit mine]] in the world, near the city of [[Calama, Chile|Calama]] in Chile.]]\n[[File:Apresenta\u00e7\u00e3o KC-390 (15414135738).jpg|thumb|[[Embraer KC-390|KC-390]] is the largest military transport aircraft produced in South America by the Brazilian company [[Embraer]].]]\n[[File:Bodega chakana hacia la monta\u00f1a.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vineyard]] in [[Luj\u00e1n de Cuyo]], province of [[Mendoza, Argentina]]]]\n\nSouth America relies less on the export of both manufactured goods and natural resources than the world average; merchandise exports from the continent were 16% of GDP on an [[nominal GDP|exchange rate]] basis, compared to 25% for the world as a whole.<ref name=wfex/> Brazil (the seventh largest economy in the world and the largest in South America) leads [[List of countries by exports|in terms of merchandise exports]] at $251 billion, followed by Venezuela at $93 billion, Chile at $86 billion, and Argentina at $84 billion.<ref name=wfex/>\n\nSince 1930, the continent has experienced remarkable growth and diversification in most economic sectors. Most agricultural and livestock products are destined for the domestic market and local consumption. However, the export of [[agriculture|agricultural products]] is essential for the [[balance of trade]] in most countries.<ref name=\"Economy\">O Sistema Econ\u00f4mico / Am\u00e9rica do Sul.

The production of staple foods such as vegetables, corn or beans is large, but focused on domestic consumption. Livestock raising for meat exports is important in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and Colombia. In tropical regions the most important crops are [[coffee]], [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[bananas]], mainly in Brazil, Colombia and Ecuador. Traditionally, the countries producing [[sugar]] for export are Peru, Guyana and Suriname, and in Brazil, [[sugar cane]] is also used to make [[ethanol]]. On the coast of Peru, northeast and south of Brazil, [[cotton]] is grown. Fifty percent of the South American surface is covered by forests, but timber industries are small and directed to domestic markets. In recent years, however, transnational companies have been settling in the [[Amazon forest|Amazon]] to exploit noble timber destined for export. The Pacific coastal waters of South America are the most important for commercial fishing. The anchovy catch reaches thousands of tons, and tuna is also abundant (Peru is a major exporter). The capture of [[crustaceans]] is remarkable, particularly in northeastern Brazil and Chile.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nOnly Brazil and Argentina are part of the [[G20]] (industrial countries), while only Brazil is part of the [[G8+5]] (the most powerful and influential nations in the world). In the tourism sector, a series of negotiations began in 2005 to promote tourism and increase air connections within the region. [[Punta del Este]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]] and [[Mar del Plata]] are among the most important resorts in South America.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nThe most industrialized countries in South America are Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay respectively. These countries alone account for more than 75 percent of the region's economy and add up to a GDP of more than US$3.0 trillion. Industries in South America began to take on the economies of the region from the 1930s when the [[Great Depression]] in the United States and other countries of the world boosted industrial production in the continent. From that period the region left the agricultural side behind and began to achieve high rates of economic growth that remained until the early 1990s when they slowed due to political instabilities, economic crises and neoliberal policies.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nSince the end of the economic crisis in Brazil and Argentina that occurred in the period from 1998 to 2002, which has led to [[economic recession]], rising unemployment and falling population income, the industrial and service sectors have been recovering rapidly. Chile, Argentina and Brazil have recovered fastest, growing at an average of 5% per year. All of South America after this period has been recovering and showing good signs of economic stability, with controlled [[inflation]] and exchange rates, continuous growth, a decrease in [[social inequality]] and unemployment\u2013factors that favor industry.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nThe main industries are: electronics, textiles, food, automotive, metallurgy, aviation, naval, clothing, beverage, steel, tobacco, timber, chemical, among others. Exports reach almost US$400 billion annually, with Brazil accounting for half of this.<ref name=\"Economy\"/>\n\nThe [[Economic inequality|economic gap]] between the rich and poor in most South American nations is larger than on most other continents.

Some of the most famous genres include [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]] from Colombia, [[pasillo]] from Colombia and Ecuador, [[samba]], [[bossa nova]] and [[m\u00fasica sertaneja]] from Brazil, and [[tango music|tango]] from Argentina and Uruguay.

In the late 20th century, [[Rock en Espa\u00f1ol|Spanish rock]] emerged by young hipsters influenced by British pop and American rock. [[Music of Brazil|Brazil]] has a Portuguese-language pop rock industry as well a great variety of other music genres.  In the central and western regions of Bolivia, Andean and folklore music like [[Diablada]], [[Caporales]] and [[Morenada]] are the most representative of the country, which were originated by European, Aymara and Quechua influences.\n\nThe [[Spanish American literature|literature]] of South America has attracted considerable critical and popular acclaim, especially with the [[Latin American Boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and the rise of authors such as [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] in novels and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] and [[Pablo Neruda]] in other genres. The Brazilians [[Machado de Assis]] and [[Jo\u00e3o Guimar\u00e3es Rosa]] are widely regarded as the greatest Brazilian writers.\n\nBecause of South America's broad ethnic mix, [[South American cuisine]] has African, South American Indian, South Asian, East Asian, and European influences. [[Bahia]], Brazil, is especially well known for its West African\u2013influenced cuisine. Argentines, Chileans, Uruguayans, Brazilians, Bolivians, and Venezuelans regularly consume wine. People in Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, southern Chile, Bolivia and Brazil drink [[mate (beverage)|mate]], an herb which is brewed. The Paraguayan version, [[terere]], differs from other forms of mate in that it is served cold. [[Pisco]] is a liquor distilled from grapes in Peru and Chile. Peruvian cuisine mixes elements from Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, African, Arab, Andean, and Amazonic food.\n\n=== Plastic arts ===\n[[File:Fernando Botero, Bird (1990), Singapore - 20040616.jpg|thumb|''Bird'' (Singapore), sculpture of [[Fernando Botero]]]]\nThe artist [[Oswaldo Guayasam\u00edn]] (1919\u20131999) from [[Ecuador]], represented with his painting style the feeling of the peoples of Latin America<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.andes.info.ec/es/noticias/guayasamin-pintor-ecuatoriano-retrato-sufrimiento-pueblos-latinoamericanos.html|title=Guayasam\u00edn, el pintor ecuatoriano que retrat\u00f3 los sufrimientos latinoamericanos|last=|first=|date=|work=Andes, Agencia de Noticias|access-date=}}</ref> highlighting social injustices in various parts of the world.

Brazil holds the record at the FIFA World Cup with five titles in total. Argentina and Uruguay have two titles each. So far four South American nations have hosted the tournament including the first edition in Uruguay (1930). The other three were Brazil (1950, 2014), Chile (1962), and Argentina (1978).\n\nSouth America is home to the longest running international football tournament; the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]], which has been regularly contested since 1916. Uruguay won the Copa Am\u00e9rica a record 15 times, surpassing hosts Argentina in 2011 to reach 15 titles (they were previously equal at 14 titles each during the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica).\n\nAlso, in South America, a multi-sport event, the [[South American Games]], are held every four years. The first edition was held in [[La Paz]] in 1978 and the most recent took place in [[Santiago]] in 2014.\n\n[[South American Cricket Championship]] is an international [[limited-overs cricket]] tournament played since 1995 featuring national teams from [[Sports in South America|South America]] and certain other invited sides including teams from North America, currently played annually but until 2013 was usually played every two seasons.\n\n==Infrastructure==\n[[File:Molino de viento (moderno) 2014-09-21 (3).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Jep\u00edrachi wind farm in the [[Guajira Peninsula]].]]\n===Energy===\nDue to the diversity of [[topography]] and pluviometric precipitation conditions, the region's water resources vary enormously in different areas. In the [[Andes]], navigation possibilities are limited, except for the Magdalena River, [[Lake Titicaca]] and the lakes of the southern regions of Chile and Argentina. Irrigation is an important factor for agriculture from northwestern Peru to Patagonia. Less than 10% of the known electrical potential of the Andes had been used until the mid-1960s.\n\nThe [[Brazilian Highlands]] has a much higher [[hydroelectric]] potential than the [[Andes|Andean region]] and its possibilities of exploitation are greater due to the existence of several large rivers with high margins and the occurrence of great differences forming huge cataracts, such as those of Paulo Afonso, Igua\u00e7u and others. The [[Amazon River]] system has about 13,000&nbsp;km of waterways, but its possibilities for hydroelectric use are still unknown.\n\nMost of the continent's energy is generated through [[hydroelectric power plants]], but there is also an important share of [[thermoelectric]] and [[wind energy]]. Brazil and Argentina are the only South American countries that generate [[nuclear power]], each with two [[nuclear power plants]]. In 1991 these countries signed a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement.\n\n{{wide image|Itaipu D\u00e9cembre 2007 - Vue G\u00e9n\u00e9rale.jpg|1500px|Panoramic view of the [[Itaipu Dam]], the largest of the world in energy production.}}\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Ruta Panamericana Buenos Aires Florida.jpg|alt=|thumb|Stretch of the [[Pan-American Highway]] in Argentina]]\n[[File:Puerto-del-callao.jpg|thumb|The Port of Callao in Lima|alt=]]\n[[File:L\u00ednea Roja de Mi Telef\u00e9rico en La Paz, Bolivia.jpg|thumb|The La Paz cable car system in Bolivia is home to both the longest and highest urban cable car network in the world.]]\n\nSouth American transportation systems are still deficient, with low kilometric densities. The region has about 1,700,000&nbsp;km of [[highways]] and 100,000&nbsp;km of [[railways]], which are concentrated in the coastal strip, and the interior is still devoid of communication.\n\nOnly two railroads are continental: the Transandina, which connects [[Buenos Aires]], in Argentina to [[Valpara\u00edso]], in Chile, and the Brazil\u2013Bolivia Railroad, which makes it the connection between the port of [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]] in Brazil and the city of [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], in Bolivia. In addition, there is the [[Pan-American Highway]], which crosses the Andean countries from north to south, although some stretches are unfinished.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/IOTD/view.php?id=88271|title=A Gap in the Andes : Image of the Day|date=2 April 2015|website=Earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=22 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nTwo areas of greater density occur in the railway sector: the platinum network, which develops around the [[Platine region]], largely belonging to Argentina, with more than 45,000&nbsp;km in length; And the [[Southeast Brazil]] network, which mainly serves the [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|state of S\u00e3o Paulo]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|state of Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Minas Gerais]]. Brazil and Argentina also stand out in the road sector. In addition to the modern roads that extend through northern Argentina and south-east and south of Brazil, a vast road complex aims to link [[Bras\u00edlia]], the federal capital, to the South, Southeast, Northeast and Northern regions of Brazil.\n\nThe Port of Callao is the main port of Peru.\nSouth America has one of the largest bays of navigable inland waterways in the world, represented mainly by the [[Amazon basin]], the [[Platine basin]], the S\u00e3o Francisco and the Orinoco basins, Brazil having about 54,000&nbsp;km navigable, while Argentina has 6,500&nbsp;km and Venezuela, 1,200&nbsp;km.\n\nThe two main merchant fleets also belong to Brazil and Argentina. The following are those of Chile, Venezuela, Peru and Colombia. The largest ports in commercial movement are those of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo|Santos]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]], [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], [[Valpara\u00edso]], [[Recife]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Montevideo]], [[Paranagu\u00e1]], [[Rio Grande]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Bel\u00e9m]] and [[Maracaibo]].\n\nIn South America, [[commercial aviation]] has a magnificent expansion field, which has one of the largest traffic density lines in the world, Rio de Janeiro\u2013S\u00e3o Paulo, and large airports, such as [[S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Congonhas Airport|Congonhas]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International Airport|S\u00e3o Paulo\u2013Guarulhos International]] and [[Viracopos International Airport|Viracopos]] (S\u00e3o Paulo), [[Rio de Janeiro\u2013Gale\u00e3o International Airport|Rio de Janeiro International]] and [[Santos Dumont Airport|Santos Dumont]] (Rio de Janeiro), [[El Dorado International Airport|El Dorado]] (Bogot\u00e1), [[Ministro Pistarini International Airport|Ezeiza]] (Buenos Aires), [[Tancredo Neves International Airport]] (Belo Horizonte), [[Afonso Pena International Airport|Curitiba International Airport]] (Curitiba), Brasilia, Caracas, Montevideo, Lima, [[Viru Viru International Airport]] (Santa Cruz de la Sierra), Recife, Salvador, Salgado Filho International Airport (Porto Alegre), Fortaleza, Manaus and Bel\u00e9m.\n\nThe main public transport in major cities is the bus.

Five complete Space Shuttle orbiter vehicles were built and flown on a total of 135 missions from 1981 to 2011, launched from the [[Kennedy Space Center]] (KSC) in Florida. Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell also constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was later fit with RS-25 engines and tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]]. Rockwell conducted structural tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effect of aerodynamic stresses.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB.

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\nFour operational OVs were originally built. Following the construction of ''Columbia'' (OV-102) and the conversion of ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' (OV-099) to a flyable spacecraft, ''Discovery'' (OV-103) and ''Atlantis'' (OV-104) were ordered in January 1979. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]] in January 1986, NASA ordered a fifth OV, ''Endeavour'' (OV-105) in July 1987.

The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after [[STS-4]] and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to gimbal the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting [[extravehicular activity]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

Early missions routinely ferried satellites, which determined the type of orbit that the orbiter vehicle would enter.  Following the ''Challenger'' disaster, many commercial payloads were moved to expendable commercial rockets, such as the [[Delta II]].

The Shuttle fleet's total mission time was 1322 days, 19 hours, 21 minutes and 23 seconds.<ref name=\"ShuttleByNumbers\">{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/12376-nasa-space-shuttle-program-facts-statistics.html |title=NASA's Space Shuttle By the Numbers: 30 Years of a Spaceflight Icon |publisher=Space.com |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |author=Malik, Tarik}}</ref>\n\nShuttle components include the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|Orbiter Vehicle]] (OV) with three clustered [[Rocketdyne RS-25]] main engines, a pair of recoverable [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]] (SRBs), and the expendable [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] (ET) containing [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]]. The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell also constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was later fit with RS-25 engines and tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]]. Rockwell conducted structural tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effect of aerodynamic stresses.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\nFour operational OVs were originally built. Following the construction of ''Columbia'' (OV-102) and the conversion of ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'' (OV-099) to a flyable spacecraft, ''Discovery'' (OV-103) and ''Atlantis'' (OV-104) were ordered in January 1979. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]] in January 1986, NASA ordered a fifth OV, ''Endeavour'' (OV-105) in July 1987.

The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after [[STS-4]] and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to gimbal the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star.

In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]].

Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting [[extravehicular activity]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

When the U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

Their village elder warns them not to dig up the weapons as it will arouse the suspicions of the Germans. One of the boys, Flyora, finds an [[SVT-40]] rifle, though the both of them are seen by an [[Focke-Wulf Fw 189|Fw 189]] flying overhead.[[File:Focke Wulf Fw189.jpg|thumb|A [[Focke-Wulf Fw 189]]. A single [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance aircraft]] of this model repeatedly appears in scenes flying above Flyora's head throughout ''Come and See'']]\n\nThe next day, partisans arrive at Flyora's house to [[Conscription|conscript]] him. Flyora becomes a low-rank [[militiaman]] and is ordered to perform menial tasks. When the partisans are ready to move on, an old partisan says that he wants to stay behind because his boots are falling apart. The partisan commander, Kosach, orders the old man to swap boots with Flyora and for Flyora to remain behind at the camp. Bitterly disappointed, Flyora walks into the forest weeping and meets Glasha, a young girl working as a nurse in the camp, and the two bond before the camp is suddenly attacked by [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger|German paratroopers]] and [[dive bomber]]s. Flyora is partially [[deaf]]ened from explosions before the two hide in the forest to avoid the German soldiers. Flyora and Glasha travel to his village, only to find his home deserted and covered in flies. Denying that his family is dead, Flyora believes that they are hiding on a nearby island across a [[bog]]. As they run from the village in the direction of the bogland, Glasha glances across her shoulder, seeing a pile of executed villagers' bodies stacked behind a house, but does not alert Flyora. The two become hysterical after wading through the bog, where Glasha then screams at Flyora that his family are actually dead in the village. They are soon met by Roubej, a partisan fighter, who takes them to a large group of villagers who have fled the Germans. Flyora sees the village elder, badly burnt by the Germans, who tells him that he witnessed his family's execution and that he should not have dug up the rifles. Flyora accepts that his family is dead and blames himself for the tragedy.\n\nRoubej takes Flyora and two other men to find food at a nearby warehouse, only to find it being guarded by German troops. During their retreat, the group unknowingly wanders through a [[minefield]] resulting in the deaths of the two companions. That evening Roubej and Flyora sneak up to an occupied village and manage to steal a cow from a collaborating farmer. However, as they escape across an open field, Roubej and the cow are shot and killed by a German [[machine gun]]. The next morning, Flyora attempts to steal a horse and cart but the owner catches him and instead of doing him harm, he helps hide Flyora's identity when [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] troops approach. Flyora is taken to the village of Perekhody, where they hurriedly discuss a fake identity for him, while the SS unit (based on the [[Dirlewanger Brigade]]) accompanied by [[Schutzmannschaft Battalion 118|Ukrainian collaborators]] surround and occupy the village. Flyora tries to warn the townsfolk they are being herded to their deaths, but is forced to join them inside a church. Flyora and a young woman bearing a strong resemblance to Glasha manage to escape; the young woman is dragged by her hair across the ground and into a truck to be [[gang rape]]d, while Flyora is forced to watch as several [[Molotov cocktail]]s are thrown onto and within the church before it is further set ablaze with a flamethrower as other soldiers shoot into the building. A German officer points a gun to Flyora's head to pose for a picture before leaving him to slump to the ground as the soldiers leave.\n\nFlyora later wanders out of the scorched village in the direction of the Germans, where he discovers they had been ambushed by the partisans. After recovering his jacket and rifle, Flyora comes across the young woman who had also escaped the church in a [[fugue state]] and covered in blood after having been gang-raped and brutalized. Flyora returns to the village and finds that his fellow partisans have captured eleven of the Germans and their collaborators, including the commander, an ''[[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer|SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]]''. While some of the captured men including the commander plead for their lives and deflect blame, a young fanatical nazi officer bluntly tells the captors that their people have no right to exist and they will carry out their mission. Kosach then forces most of the collaborators to douse the Germans with a can of petrol but the disgusted crowd shoots them all before they can be set on fire. As the partisans leave, Flyora notices a framed portrait of [[Adolf Hitler]] in a puddle and proceeds to shoot it numerous times. As he does so, a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of clips from Hitler's life play in reverse, but when Hitler is shown as a baby on his [[Klara Hitler|mother]]'s lap, Flyora stops shooting and cries.{{Rquote |1=right |2=We are obliged to exterminate the population\u2014this is part of our mission to protect the German population.

I had been reading and rereading the book ''I Am from the Fiery Village'', which consisted of the first-hand accounts of people who miraculously survived the horrors of the fascist genocide in Belorussia. Many of them were still alive then, and Belorussians managed to record some of their memories onto film. I will never forget the face and eyes of one peasant, and his quiet recollection about how his whole village had been herded into a church, and how just before they were about to be burned, an officer gave them the offer: \"Whoever has no children can leave\". And he couldn't take it, he left, and left behind his wife and little kids&nbsp;... or about how another village was burned: the adults were all herded into a barn, but the children were left behind. And later, the drunk men surrounded them with sheepdogs and let the dogs tear the children to pieces.\n\nAnd then I thought: the world doesn't know about [[Khatyn massacre|Khatyn]]! They know about Katyn, about the massacre of the Polish officers there. But they don't know about Belorussia. Even though more than 600 villages were burned there!\n\nAnd I decided to make a film about this tragedy. I perfectly understood that the film would end up a harsh one. I decided that the central role of the village lad Flyora would not be played by a professional actor, who upon immersion into a difficult role could have protected himself psychologically with his accumulated acting experience, technique and skill. I wanted to find a simple boy fourteen years of age. We had to prepare him for the most difficult experiences, then capture them on film. And at the same time, we had to protect him from the stresses so that he wasn't left in the loony bin after filming was over, but was returned to his mother alive and healthy.

(The movie has been compared both to ''[[Schindler's List]]'' and ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', and it would not be surprising to learn that [[Steven Spielberg]] had screened it before making either of these.) The film's central atrocity is a barbaric circus of blaring music and barking dogs in which a squadron of drunken German soldiers round up and parade the peasants to their fiery doom&nbsp;... The bit of actual death-camp corpse footage that Klimov uses is doubly disturbing in that it retrospectively diminishes the care with which he orchestrates the town's destruction.

Their village elder warns them not to dig up the weapons as it will arouse the suspicions of the Germans. One of the boys, Flyora, finds an [[SVT-40]] rifle, though the both of them are seen by an [[Focke-Wulf Fw 189|Fw 189]] flying overhead.[[File:Focke Wulf Fw189.jpg|thumb|A [[Focke-Wulf Fw 189]]. A single [[Aerial reconnaissance|reconnaissance aircraft]] of this model repeatedly appears in scenes flying above Flyora's head throughout Come and See]]\n\nThe next day, partisans arrive at Flyora's house to [[Conscription|conscript]] him. Flyora becomes a low-rank [[militiaman]] and is ordered to perform menial tasks. When the partisans are ready to move on, an old partisan says that he wants to stay behind because his boots are falling apart. The partisan commander, Kosach, orders the old man to swap boots with Flyora and for Flyora to remain behind at the camp. Bitterly disappointed, Flyora walks into the forest weeping and meets Glasha, a young girl working as a nurse in the camp, and the two bond before the camp is suddenly attacked by [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger|German paratroopers]] and [[dive bomber]]s. Flyora is partially [[deaf]]ened from explosions before the two hide in the forest to avoid the German soldiers. Flyora and Glasha travel to his village, only to find his home deserted and covered in flies. Denying that his family is dead, Flyora believes that they are hiding on a nearby island across a [[bog]]. As they run from the village in the direction of the bogland, Glasha glances across her shoulder, seeing a pile of executed villagers' bodies stacked behind a house, but does not alert Flyora. The two become hysterical after wading through the bog, where Glasha then screams at Flyora that his family are actually dead in the village. They are soon met by Roubej, a partisan fighter, who takes them to a large group of villagers who have fled the Germans. Flyora sees the village elder, badly burnt by the Germans, who tells him that he witnessed his family's execution and that he should not have dug up the rifles. Flyora accepts that his family is dead and blames himself for the tragedy.\n\nRoubej takes Flyora and two other men to find food at a nearby warehouse, only to find it being guarded by German troops. During their retreat, the group unknowingly wanders through a [[minefield]] resulting in the deaths of the two companions. That evening Roubej and Flyora sneak up to an occupied village and manage to steal a cow from a collaborating farmer. However, as they escape across an open field, Roubej and the cow are shot and killed by a German [[machine gun]]. The next morning, Flyora attempts to steal a horse and cart but the owner catches him and instead of doing him harm, he helps hide Flyora's identity when [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] troops approach. Flyora is taken to the village of Perekhody, where they hurriedly discuss a fake identity for him, while the SS unit (based on the [[Dirlewanger Brigade]]) accompanied by [[Schutzmannschaft Battalion 118|Ukrainian collaborators]] surround and occupy the village. Flyora tries to warn the townsfolk they are being herded to their deaths, but is forced to join them inside a church. Flyora and a young woman bearing a strong resemblance to Glasha manage to escape; the young woman is dragged by her hair across the ground and into a truck to be [[gang rape]]d, while Flyora is forced to watch as several [[Molotov cocktail]]s are thrown onto and within the church before it is further set ablaze with a flamethrower as other soldiers shoot into the building. A German officer points a gun to Flyora's head to pose for a picture before leaving him to slump to the ground as the soldiers leave.\n\nFlyora later wanders out of the scorched village in the direction of the Germans, where he discovers they had been ambushed by the partisans. After recovering his jacket and rifle, Flyora comes across the young woman who had also escaped the church in a [[fugue state]] and covered in blood after having been gang-raped and brutalized. Flyora returns to the village and finds that his fellow partisans have captured eleven of the Germans and their collaborators, including the commander, an ''[[Sturmbannf\u00fchrer|SS-Sturmbannf\u00fchrer]]''. While some of the captured men including the commander plead for their lives and deflect blame, a young fanatical nazi officer bluntly tells the captors that their people have no right to exist and they will carry out their mission. Kosach then forces most of the collaborators to douse the Germans with a can of petrol but the disgusted crowd shoots them all before they can be set on fire. As the partisans leave, Flyora notices a framed portrait of [[Adolf Hitler]] in a puddle and proceeds to shoot it numerous times. As he does so, a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] of clips from Hitler's life play in reverse, but when Hitler is shown as a baby on his [[Klara Hitler|mother]]'s lap, Flyora stops shooting and cries.{{Rquote |1=right |2=We are obliged to exterminate the population\u2014this is part of our mission to protect the German population.

I had been reading and rereading the book ''I Am from the Fiery Village'', which consisted of the first-hand accounts of people who miraculously survived the horrors of the fascist genocide in Belorussia. Many of them were still alive then, and Belorussians managed to record some of their memories onto film. I will never forget the face and eyes of one peasant, and his quiet recollection about how his whole village had been herded into a church, and how just before they were about to be burned, an officer gave them the offer: \"Whoever has no children can leave\". And he couldn't take it, he left, and left behind his wife and little kids&nbsp;... or about how another village was burned: the adults were all herded into a barn, but the children were left behind. And later, the drunk men surrounded them with sheepdogs and let the dogs tear the children to pieces.\n\nAnd then I thought: the world doesn't know about [[Khatyn massacre|Khatyn]]! They know about Katyn, about the massacre of the Polish officers there. But they don't know about Belorussia. Even though more than 600 villages were burned there!\n\nAnd I decided to make a film about this tragedy. I perfectly understood that the film would end up a harsh one. I decided that the central role of the village lad Flyora would not be played by a professional actor, who upon immersion into a difficult role could have protected himself psychologically with his accumulated acting experience, technique and skill. I wanted to find a simple boy fourteen years of age. We had to prepare him for the most difficult experiences, then capture them on film. And at the same time, we had to protect him from the stresses so that he wasn't left in the loony bin after filming was over, but was returned to his mother alive and healthy. Fortunately, with Aleksey Kravchenko, who played Flyora and who later became a good actor, everything went smoothly.\n\nI understood that this would be a very brutal film and that it was unlikely that people would be able to watch it. I told this to my screenplay coauthor, the writer Ales Adamovich. But he replied: \"Let them not watch it, then. This is something we must leave after us. As evidence of war, and as a plea for peace.\"\n|sign=|source=|4=Elem Klimov\n|5=AIF.<ref name=\"aif\"/>}}\n\n{{quote|''Come and See'' was shot only on Belarusian soil.

Hoberman]] of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' reviewed ''Come and See'', writing the following: \"Directed for baroque intensity, ''Come and See'' is a robust art film with aspirations to the visionary \u2013 not so much graphic as leisurely literal-minded in its representation of mass murder. (The movie has been compared both to ''[[Schindler's List]]'' and ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'', and it would not be surprising to learn that [[Steven Spielberg]] had screened it before making either of these.) The film's central atrocity is a barbaric circus of blaring music and barking dogs in which a squadron of drunken German soldiers round up and parade the peasants to their fiery doom&nbsp;... The bit of actual death-camp corpse footage that Klimov uses is doubly disturbing in that it retrospectively diminishes the care with which he orchestrates the town's destruction. For the most part, he prefers to show the [[Gorgon]] as reflected in [[Perseus]]'s shield. There are few images more indelible than the sight of young Alexei Kravchenko's fear-petrified expression.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Hoberman |first=J. |authorlink=J.

All five convictions were vacated in 2002 after Matias Reyes, a convicted serial rapist and murderer, confessed to having been the sole perpetrator of the crime, and DNA testing showed he was the sole contributor of the DNA of the semen on the victim.

It is based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batwoman]], a costumed crime-fighter created by [[Geoff Johns]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Greg Rucka]], [[Mark Waid]], and [[Keith Giffen]], and is set in the [[Arrowverse]], sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe. The series premiered on [[The CW]] on October 6, 2019 and is primarily filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, with location filming in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. ''Batwoman'' follows Kate Kane overcoming her demons and past to become Gotham City's new symbol of hope as the vigilante Batwoman.\n\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Batwoman would appear in \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", the Arrowverse series' 2018 crossover, with an announcement two months later that a series centered on the character was in development from Dries. [[Ruby Rose]] was cast in the title role in August of the same year. In January 2019, the series received a pilot order from the CW, to be considered for a series order in the [[2019\u201320 United States network television schedule|2019\u201320 television season]]. The show was picked up to series in May 2019 and in October 2019 a full season of 22 episodes was ordered.

August hooks up Mouse to a canister of fear toxin and tells him he killed Alice.

Following this, Luke discovers that Myrtle changed her name to Veronica May and Duela's victims were all connected to Dr. Campbell.

It is based on the [[DC Comics]] character [[Batwoman]], a costumed crime-fighter created by [[Geoff Johns]], [[Grant Morrison]], [[Greg Rucka]], [[Mark Waid]], and [[Keith Giffen]], and is set in the [[Arrowverse]], sharing continuity with the other television series of the universe. The series premiered on [[The CW]] on October 6, 2019 and is primarily filmed in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada, with location filming in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. ''Batwoman'' follows Kate Kane overcoming her demons and past to become Gotham City's new symbol of hope as the vigilante Batwoman.\n\nIn May 2018, it was announced that Batwoman would appear in \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", the Arrowverse series' 2018 crossover, with an announcement two months later that a series centered on the character was in development from Dries. [[Ruby Rose]] was cast in the title role in August of the same year. In January 2019, the series received a pilot order from the CW, to be considered for a series order in the [[2019\u201320 United States network television schedule|2019\u201320 television season]]. The show was picked up to series in May 2019 and in October 2019 a full season of 22 episodes was ordered. In January 2020, The CW renewed the series for a second season.\n\n== Premise ==\nThree years after billionaire philanthropist Bruce Wayne and his vigilante alter ego [[Batman]] disappeared,{{efn|It is stated by Kate Kane in the ''[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]'' crossover that both Batman and Bruce Wayne have \"gone missing.\"}} his cousin Kate Kane sets out to overcome her demons and become a symbol of hope by protecting the streets of [[Gotham City]] as [[Batwoman]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a27499099/batwoman-season-1-trailer-arrowverse/ |title=Batwoman trailer reveals origin of Ruby Rose's LGBTQ+ superhero |date=May 16, 2019 |work=Digital Spy |access-date=June 3, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603034728/https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a27499099/batwoman-season-1-trailer-arrowverse/ |archive-date=June 3, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"BatwomanSeries\" />\n\n== Cast and characters ==\n<!--Can someone split the character section when Season Two begins?-->\n=== Main ===\n<!--Main cast order is according to original broadcasting credits (the pilot episode).

The Zaporozhian Sich, however, represented a safe haven for runaway serfs, where the state authority did not extend, and often took part in rebellions which were constantly breaking out in Ukraine.

In 1778 the Turkish sultan offered the exiled Zaporozhians the chance to build a new [[Danubian Sich]].

Owing to their service in the war, on 6 October 1774 [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] issued a manifesto granting their request.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe end of the war and the [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]] brought Russia's frontiers south from the [[Kuban River]]'s entry into the [[Azov Sea]] along its right bank and right to the bend of the [[Terek River]]. This created a 500-[[verst]] undefended border, and in the summer of 1777 the Khopyor regiment - in addition to the remnants of the [[Volga Cossacks]] and a [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] [[Dragoon]] regiment - were re-settled in the [[North Caucasus|Northern Caucasus]] to build the [[Azov]]-[[Mozdok, Republic of North Ossetia\u2013Alania|Mozdok]] defence line. This marked the start of the [[Caucasus War]], which would continue for almost 90 years.\n\nThe Khopyor regiment was responsible for the western flank of the line. In 1778-1782, Khopyor Cossacks founded four [[stanitsa]]s: Stavropolskaya (next to the fortress of [[Stavropol]], established on 22 October 1777), Moskovskaya, Donskaya and Severnaya \u2013 with approximately 140 Cossack families in each. In 1779, the Khopyor regiment was given its own district. The conditions were desperate as the Circassians would mount almost daily raids on the Russian positions. In 1825-1826 the regiment began its first expansions, pushing westwards to the bend of the [[Kuban River]] and founding five new stanitsas (the so-called new-Kuban line: [[\u0411\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f|Barsukovskaya]], [[Nevinnomyssk]]aya, [[\u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f|Belomechetskaya]], Batalpashinskaya (modern [[Cherkessk]]), [[\u0411\u0435\u043a\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f|Bekeshevskaya]] and Karantynnaya (currently - [[\u0421\u0443\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f|Suvorovskaya]]).

The Khopyor regiment was also given several civilian settlements, raising its manpower to 12,000.

The Black Sea Cossacks sent men to many major campaigns at the Russian Empire's demand, such as the suppression of the Polish [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] in 1794, the ill-fated [[Persian Expedition of 1796]] where nearly half of the Cossacks died from hunger and disease, and sent the 9th [[plastun]] (infantry) and 1st joint cavalry regiments as well as the first [[Leib Guard]]s (elite) [[sotnia]] to aid the Russian Army in the [[French invasion of Russia (1812)|Patriotic War of 1812]]. The new host participated in the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]] where they stormed the last remaining Ottoman bastion of the northern Black Sea coast, the fortress of [[Anapa]], in 1828. In the course of the [[Crimean War]] of 1853 to 1856, the Cossacks foiled any attempts of allied landing on the [[Taman Peninsula]], whilst the 2nd and 5th plastun battalions took part in the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|Defence of Sevastopol]].\n\nIn the land they left behind, the [[Buh Cossacks]] were able to provide a strong buffer from the [[Danubian Sich]]. After the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)]] most of the Danube Cossacks officially turned themselves over and under amnesty were resettled between the [[Mariupol]] and [[Berdyansk]], forming the [[Azov Cossack Host]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Expansion==\n[[File:Kubanskie kazaki 2.jpg|thumb|left|Late 19th century]]\n\nAs the years went by, the Black Sea Cossacks continued its systematic penetrations into the mountainous regions of the Northern Caucasus. Taking an active part in the finale of the [[Caucasian War|Russian conquest of the Northern Caucasus]], they settled the regions each time these were conquered. To aid them, a total of 70 thousand additional ex-Zaporozhians from the [[Bug Cossacks|Bug]], [[Yekaterinoslav Cossack Host|Yekaterinoslav]], and finally the [[Azov Cossack Host]] migrated there in the mid 19th century. All three of the former were necessary to be removed to vacate space for the colonisation of [[New Russia]], and with the increasing weakness of the Ottoman Empire as well as the formation of independent buffer states in the Balkans, the need for further Cossack presence had ended. They made the migration to the Kuban in 1860.  Separating the ethnic Ukrainian Black Sea Cossacks from the Caucasian mountain tribes were the [[Caucasus Line Cossack Host]], ethnic Russian Cossacks from the Don region. Although both groups lived in the general Kuban region, they did not integrate with each other.<ref name = \"Procyk\">Anna Procyk. (1995).

The Kuban Cossacks continued to make an active part in the Russian affairs of the 19th century starting from the finale of the [[Russian-Circassian War]] which ceased shortly after the hosts' formation. A small group took part in the 1873 conquest that brought the [[Khanate of Khiva]] under Russian control. Their largest military campaign was the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)]], on both the Balkan and the Caucasus fronts. The latter in particular was a strong contribution as the Kuban Cossacks made 90% of the Russian cavalry. Famous achievements in the numerous [[Battle of Shipka Pass|Battles of Shipka]], the defence of [[Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t|Bayazet]] and finally, in decisive and victorious [[Battle of Kars]] where the Cossacks were the first to enter. Three Kuban Cossack regiments took part in the storming of [[Geok Tepe]] in Turkmenistan in 1881. During the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u20131905), the host mobilised six cavalry regiments, five plastun battalions and one battery to the distant region of Russia.\n\nThe Cossacks also carried out the second strategical objective, the colonisation of the Kuban land. In total, the host owned more than six million tithes, of which 5.7 million belonged to the stanitsas, with the remaining in the reserve or in private hands of Cossack officers and officials. Upon reaching the age of 17, a Cossack would be given between 16 and 30 tithes for cultivation and personal use. With the natural growth of the population, the average land that a Cossack owned decreased from 23 tithes in the 1860s to 7.6 in 1917. Such arrangements, however ensured that the colonisation and the cultivation would be very rational.\n\nThe military purpose of the Kuban was echoed in its administration pattern. Rather than a traditional Imperial [[Governorate (Russia)|Guberniya]] (governorate) with [[uyezd]]s (districts), the territory was administered by the [[Kuban Oblast]] which was split into otdels (regions, which in 1888 counted seven). Each otdel would have its own [[sotnia]]s which in turn would be split into [[stanitsa]]s and [[khutor]]s. The [[Ataman]] (commander) for each region was not only responsible for the military preparation of the Cossacks, but for the local administration duties. Local Stanitsa and Khutor atamans were elected, but approved by the atamans of the otdel. These, in turn, were appointed by the supreme ataman of the host, who was in turn appointed directly by the Russian Emperor. Prior to 1870, this system of legislature in the Oblast remained a robust military one and all legal decisions were carried out by the stanitsa ataman and two elected judges. Afterwards, however, the system was bureaucratised and the judicial functions became independent of the stanitsas.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe more liberal policy of the Kuban was directly mirrored in the living standards of the people. One of the central features of this was education. Indeed, the first schools were known to have existed since the migration of the Black Sea Cossacks, and by 1860, the host had one male high school and 30 elementary schools.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In 1863, the first periodical \u041a\u0443\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0438 - ''Kubanskiye voiskovye vedomsti'' began printing, and two years later the host's library was opened in Yekaterinodar. In all, by 1870, the number of schools in rural stanitsas increased to 170. Compared with the rest of the Russian Empire, by the start of the 20th century the Oblast had a very high literacy rate of 50% and each year up to 30 students from Cossack families (again a rate unmatched by any other rural province) were sent to study in the [[Education in Russia|higher education establishments of Russia]].\n\nDuring the early twentieth century contacts between Kuban and Ukraine were established and clandestine Ukrainian organizations appeared in Kuban.<ref name=\"Procyk\"/><!--\nHowever, frictions with the Tsarist administration was also widespread. During the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] the pro-liberal reforms effectively split the Caucasus lines by creating an independent [[Stavropol Oblast]], which was settled by rural peasants seeking to colonise the new lands, which were forcibly confiscated from the Cossacks. These migrations led to a large [[Armenians in Kuban|Armenian]] and [[Ukrainians in Kuban|Ukrainian]] minorities to form. Such that by 1888, the non-Cossack share of Kuban Oblast was 48%. Other administrative reforms, prevented the Cossacks from colonising regions of the Kuban such as its Black Sea Coast, where a separate [[Black Sea Governorate]] existed. Nonetheless, it was a Kuban Cossack, that used his body as a human shield to protect the Emperor in 1881 assassination, wounded mortally by the blast, it was the Tsar's own insistence to leave the carriage and thank the dying Cossack that allowed the terrorists to through the second bomb which ultimately took the Emperor's life as well.-->\n\n===Uniform and equipment===\n[[File:Kubanskie Kazaki.jpg|thumb|Kuban Cossacks in 1915.]]\nUntil 1914 the Kuban Cossack Host wore a full dress uniform comprising a dark grey/black [[kaftan]] (knee length collarless coat) with red shoulder straps and braiding on the wide cuffs. Ornamental containers (''gaziri'') which had originally contained single loading measures of gunpowder for muzzle-loading muskets, were worn on the breasts of the kaftans. The kaftan had an open front, showing a red waistcoat.<ref>{{cite book|first=Vladimir A.|last=Emmanuel|pages=90 & 91 & 105|title=The Russian Imperial Cavalry in 1914|ISBN=978-0-9889532-1-5}}</ref> Wide grey trousers were worn, tucked into soft leather boots without heels.

A black felt cloak (''bourki'') was worn in bad weather both in peace-time and on active service.\n\nThe Kuban and Terek Cossacks of the Imperial Escort (''Konvoi'') wore a special gala uniform; including a scarlet kaftan edged with gold braid and a white waistcoat.<ref>{{cite book|first=Vladimir A.|last=Emmanuel|page=12|title=The Russian Imperial Cavalry in 1914|ISBN=978-0-9889532-1-5}}</ref>\n\n===Russian Revolution and Civil War===\nDuring the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and resulting [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], the Cossacks found themselves conflicted in their loyalties. In October 1917, the [[Kuban Soviet Republic]] and the [[Kuban Rada]] were formed simultaneously, with both proclaiming their right to rule the Kuban. Shortly after the Rada declared a [[Kuban National Republic]], but this was soon dispersed by Bolshevik forces. While most Cossacks initially sided with the Rada, many joined the Bolsheviks who promised them autonomy.\n[[File:Nicholas II and children with Cossacks of the Guard.jpg|thumb|left|Kuban Cossacks of the Imperial Escort pose with [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and his family.]]\n\nIn March 1918, after [[Lavr Kornilov]]'s successful offensive, the Kuban Rada placed itself under his authority. With his death in June 1918, however, a federative union was signed with the Ukrainian government of Hetman [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] after which many Cossacks left to return home or defected to the Bolsheviks. Additionally, there was an internal struggle among the Kuban cossacks over loyalty towards [[Anton Denikin]]'s [[Volunteer Army|Russian Volunteer Army]] and the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].\n\nOn 6 November 1919, Denikin's forces surrounded the Rada, and with the help of Ataman [[Alexander Filimonov (Cossack)|Alexander Filimonov]] arrested ten of its members, including the [[Ukrainophile]], P. Kurgansky, who was the premier of the Rada, and publicly hanged one of them for treason. Many Cossacks joined Denikin and fought in the ranks of the Volunteer Army. In December 1919, after Denikin's defeat and as it became clear that the Bolsheviks would overrun the Kuban, some of the pro-Ukrainian groups attempted to restore the Rada and to break away from the Volunteer Army and fight the Bolsheviks in alliance with Ukraine;<ref name=\"Encyclopedioa\">{{cite book| author=Kubijovic, V..|title=Ukraine: A Concise Encyclopedia| location= Toronto|publisher= University of Toronto Press|year = 1963|pages = 790\u2013793}}</ref> however, by early 1920 the [[Red Army]] took most of Kuban, and both the Rada and Denikin were ousted.\n\n===World War II===\n====Collaborators in Wehrmacht and Waffen SS====\n[[File:Genera\u0142 Heinz Reinefarth w czapce kubance i 3 pu\u0142k Kozak\u00f3w.jpg|thumb|right|Waffen SS and the Regiment III of Cossacks during [[Warsaw Uprising]].

After the German defeat at [[Stalingrad]], the 4th Guards Kuban Cossack Corps, strengthened by tanks and artillery, broke through the German lines and liberated [[Mineralnye Vody]], and [[Stavropol]].\n\nFor the latter part of the war, although the Cossacks did prove especially useful in reconnaissance and rear guards, the war did show that the age of horse cavalry had come to an end. The famous 4th Guards Kuban Cossack Regiment which took part in heavy fighting in the course of the liberation of Southern Ukraine and Romania was allowed to proudly march on the [[Red Square]] in the famous [[Victory parade]] of 1945.\n\n==Modern Kuban Cossacks==\n[[File:Flag of Kuban People's Republic.svg|right|thumb|150px|Flag of the Kuban Cossacks]]\nFollowing the war, the Cossack regiments, along with remaining cavalry were disbanded and removed from the Soviet armed forces as they were thought to be obsolete.\n\nStarting in the late 1980s, there were renewed efforts to revive Cossack traditions which went to great lengths; in 1990, the Host was once again recognised by the Supreme [[Ataman]] of the [[Don Cossacks|All-Great Don Host]] (\u0412\u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435). At this time some pro-Ukrainian sentiment emerged among some Kuban Cossack leaders.  For example, when in May 1993 Cossack leader Yevhen Nahai was arrested and accused of plotting a coup, another Cossack leader (kish otaman Pyuypenko) threatened to call for support for Ukraine if Nahai's rights were violated. A march of cossack cavalry from eastern Ukraine to Kuban was met with some enthusiasm by locals.<ref>Serhiy Plokhy.(2008). ''Ukraine and Russia: Representations of the Past''.

The latter conflict was in particular special for the Kuban Cossacks, initially a number of Cossacks fled from the de-Cossackization repressions of the 1920s and assimilated with the [[Abkhaz people]]. Before the [[Georgian-Abkhaz Conflict]] there was a strong movement of creating an Abkhaz-Kuban Host among the descendants. When the civil war broke out, 1500 Kuban Cossack volunteers from Russia came to aid the Abkhaz side. One of the notable groups was the 1st [[sotnia]] under the command of Ataman Nikolay Pusko which reportedly completely destroyed a Ukrainian volunteer group fighting on the Georgian side and then went on to be the first to enter Sukhumi in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perov|first=Sergei|url=http://www.newizv.ru/news/2004-02-11/4562/|script-title=ru:\u041a\u0443\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0442 \u0421\u0443\u0445\u0443\u043c\u0438 -\u0413\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0422\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0430\u0431\u0445\u0430\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044b|trans-title=Kuban Cossacks take Sukhumi - Governor Alexander Tkachov has taken on the solution to the Abkhazian problem|language=ru|publisher=Newizv.ru|location=Krasnodar Krai|date=11 February 2004|accessdate=25 April 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714025831/http://www.newizv.ru/news/2004-02-11/4562/|archivedate=14 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Since then, a detachment of Kuban Cossacks continue to inhabit Abkhazia, and their presence continues to influence the [[Georgian-Russian relations]].\n\nAccording to human rights reports from the 1990s, the Cossacks regularly harassed non-Russians, such as Armenians and Chechens, living in southern Russia.<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,49709c7d2,3ae6a6b57,0.html Russia: Cossacks and their role in Sochi (Krasnodar Krai)].

It was composed of seven subdivisions (''otdels''), and numbered 1.3 million people (278 ''stanitsas'' and 32 ''khutors''). Kuban Cossacks formed regular units of the Imperial Russian Army as listed below. The following lists the structure prior to the outbreak of World War I, although this would be re-organised during the conflict (see foot-note).\n\nIn peacetime the Host provided 10 horse regiments making up a Kuban Cossack division, six ''plastun'' (infantry) battalions and six horse-artillery batteries; in addition to irregular and support units. The \"first\" regiments were linked to the specific locales that they were recruited from, although they would often be deployed elsewhere in the Empire. In wartime, recruits were drafted from each region to form \"second\" regiments during the stage of initial mobilization. If further manpower was required, a \"third\" regiment would be formed to be dispatched as reinforcements. During World War One a total of 37 horse (cavalry) regiments were raised by the Kuban Cossack Host.\n \n[[File:Map of Kuban Oblast (1916).jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 1916 map of Kuban Oblast with the neighboring [[Black Sea Governorate]] and part of [[Sukhumi Okrug]] {{in lang|ru}}]]\n\n'''Regiments:'''\n* 1st and 2nd Kuban Life Guard sotnias of His Imperial Majesty's personal convoy (a special unit of the [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Imperial Guard]] acting for personal protection of the monarch)\n* 1st Khopyor regiment \"Her Imperial Highness [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna]]\"\n* 1st Kuban regiment \"General Field Marshal [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich]]\"\n* 1st Zaporozhian regiment \"Empress [[Catherine the Great]]\"\n* 1st Yekaterinodar regiment \"Kosh Ataman [[Zakhary Chepiha|Chepiga]]\"\n* 1st Poltavskaya regiment \"Yekatrinoslav Viceroy General Field Marshal Prince [[Grigory Potemkin|Potyomkin-Tavrichesky]]\"\n* 1st Umanskaya regiment \"Brigadier [[Antin Holovaty|Golovaty]]\"\n* 1st Taman regiment \"General [[Alexey Bezrkovny|Bezkrovny]]\"\n* 1st Laba regiment \"General [[Grigory Zas|Zass]]\"\n* 1st Line regiment \"General [[Nikolaya Velyaminov|Velyaminov]]\"\n* 1st Black Sea regiment \"Colonel [[Fyodor Bursak|Bursak]]\"\n\n'''Divisions:'''\n* Kuban Cossack Division (after the outbreak of World War I, the Russian Army began reforming this system along modern lines, but only one division was in existence in 1914)\n\n'''Plastuns:'''\n* 1st Kuban [[plastun]] battalion \"General Field Marshal [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich]]\"\n* 2nd through 6th Kuban plastun battalions\n\nAs noted the ''plastun'' units served as infantry.

Owing to their service in the war, on 6 October 1774 [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] issued a manifesto granting their request.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe end of the war and the [[Treaty of K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Kaynarca]] brought Russia's frontiers south from the [[Kuban River]]'s entry into the [[Azov Sea]] along its right bank and right to the bend of the [[Terek River]]. This created a 500-[[verst]] undefended border, and in the summer of 1777 the Khopyor regiment - in addition to the remnants of the [[Volga Cossacks]] and a [[Vladimir, Russia|Vladimir]] [[Dragoon]] regiment - were re-settled in the [[North Caucasus|Northern Caucasus]] to build the [[Azov]]-[[Mozdok, Republic of North Ossetia\u2013Alania|Mozdok]] defence line. This marked the start of the [[Caucasus War]], which would continue for almost 90 years.\n\nThe Khopyor regiment was responsible for the western flank of the line. In 1778-1782, Khopyor Cossacks founded four [[stanitsa]]s: Stavropolskaya (next to the fortress of [[Stavropol]], established on 22 October 1777), Moskovskaya, Donskaya and Severnaya \u2013 with approximately 140 Cossack families in each. In 1779, the Khopyor regiment was given its own district. The conditions were desperate as the Circassians would mount almost daily raids on the Russian positions. In 1825-1826 the regiment began its first expansions, pushing westwards to the bend of the [[Kuban River]] and founding five new stanitsas (the so-called new-Kuban line: [[\u0411\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0443\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f|Barsukovskaya]], [[Nevinnomyssk]]aya, [[\u0411\u0435\u043b\u043e\u043c\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f|Belomechetskaya]], Batalpashinskaya (modern [[Cherkessk]]), [[\u0411\u0435\u043a\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f|Bekeshevskaya]] and Karantynnaya (currently - [[\u0421\u0443\u0432\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f|Suvorovskaya]]).

The Khopyor regiment was also given several civilian settlements, raising its manpower to 12,000. With the further advance to the [[Bolshaya Laba River|Laba River]] the Khopyor district was split into two regiments, and  Spokoynaya, Ispravnaya, Podgornaya, Udobnaya, Peredovaya, Storozhevaya formed the Laba line.\n\n===Zaporozhets beyond the Kuban River===\n{{main|Black Sea Cossack Host}}\n[[File:KOZAKS of the BLACK SEA on the MAP of 1806.JPG|thumb|left|Historic map, showing the initial settlement of the Black Sea Cossacks]]\n\nMany traditions of the Zaporozhian Cossacks continued in the Black Sea Cossacks, such as the formal election of the host administration, but in some cases, new traditions replaced the old. Instead of a central Sich, a defence line was formed from the Kuban River Black Sea inlet to the [[Bolshaya Laba River]] inlet. The land north of this line was settled with villages called [[stanitsa]]s. The administrative centre of [[Yekaterinodar]] (literally \"Catherine's gift\") was built. The Black Sea Cossacks sent men to many major campaigns at the Russian Empire's demand, such as the suppression of the Polish [[Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising]] in 1794, the ill-fated [[Persian Expedition of 1796]] where nearly half of the Cossacks died from hunger and disease, and sent the 9th [[plastun]] (infantry) and 1st joint cavalry regiments as well as the first [[Leib Guard]]s (elite) [[sotnia]] to aid the Russian Army in the [[French invasion of Russia (1812)|Patriotic War of 1812]]. The new host participated in the [[Russo-Persian War (1826-1828)]] where they stormed the last remaining Ottoman bastion of the northern Black Sea coast, the fortress of [[Anapa]], in 1828. In the course of the [[Crimean War]] of 1853 to 1856, the Cossacks foiled any attempts of allied landing on the [[Taman Peninsula]], whilst the 2nd and 5th plastun battalions took part in the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1854\u20131855)|Defence of Sevastopol]].\n\nIn the land they left behind, the [[Buh Cossacks]] were able to provide a strong buffer from the [[Danubian Sich]]. After the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828\u20131829)]] most of the Danube Cossacks officially turned themselves over and under amnesty were resettled between the [[Mariupol]] and [[Berdyansk]], forming the [[Azov Cossack Host]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\n==Expansion==\n[[File:Kubanskie kazaki 2.jpg|thumb|left|Late 19th century]]\n\nAs the years went by, the Black Sea Cossacks continued its systematic penetrations into the mountainous regions of the Northern Caucasus. Taking an active part in the finale of the [[Caucasian War|Russian conquest of the Northern Caucasus]], they settled the regions each time these were conquered. To aid them, a total of 70 thousand additional ex-Zaporozhians from the [[Bug Cossacks|Bug]], [[Yekaterinoslav Cossack Host|Yekaterinoslav]], and finally the [[Azov Cossack Host]] migrated there in the mid 19th century. All three of the former were necessary to be removed to vacate space for the colonisation of [[New Russia]], and with the increasing weakness of the Ottoman Empire as well as the formation of independent buffer states in the Balkans, the need for further Cossack presence had ended. They made the migration to the Kuban in 1860.  Separating the ethnic Ukrainian Black Sea Cossacks from the Caucasian mountain tribes were the [[Caucasus Line Cossack Host]], ethnic Russian Cossacks from the Don region. Although both groups lived in the general Kuban region, they did not integrate with each other.<ref name = \"Procyk\">Anna Procyk. (1995).

The Kuban Cossacks continued to make an active part in the Russian affairs of the 19th century starting from the finale of the [[Russian-Circassian War]] which ceased shortly after the hosts' formation. A small group took part in the 1873 conquest that brought the [[Khanate of Khiva]] under Russian control. Their largest military campaign was the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)]], on both the Balkan and the Caucasus fronts. The latter in particular was a strong contribution as the Kuban Cossacks made 90% of the Russian cavalry. Famous achievements in the numerous [[Battle of Shipka Pass|Battles of Shipka]], the defence of [[Do\u011fubeyaz\u0131t|Bayazet]] and finally, in decisive and victorious [[Battle of Kars]] where the Cossacks were the first to enter. Three Kuban Cossack regiments took part in the storming of [[Geok Tepe]] in Turkmenistan in 1881. During the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u20131905), the host mobilised six cavalry regiments, five plastun battalions and one battery to the distant region of Russia.\n\nThe Cossacks also carried out the second strategical objective, the colonisation of the Kuban land. In total, the host owned more than six million tithes, of which 5.7 million belonged to the stanitsas, with the remaining in the reserve or in private hands of Cossack officers and officials. Upon reaching the age of 17, a Cossack would be given between 16 and 30 tithes for cultivation and personal use. With the natural growth of the population, the average land that a Cossack owned decreased from 23 tithes in the 1860s to 7.6 in 1917. Such arrangements, however ensured that the colonisation and the cultivation would be very rational.\n\nThe military purpose of the Kuban was echoed in its administration pattern. Rather than a traditional Imperial [[Governorate (Russia)|Guberniya]] (governorate) with [[uyezd]]s (districts), the territory was administered by the [[Kuban Oblast]] which was split into otdels (regions, which in 1888 counted seven). Each otdel would have its own [[sotnia]]s which in turn would be split into [[stanitsa]]s and [[khutor]]s. The [[Ataman]] (commander) for each region was not only responsible for the military preparation of the Cossacks, but for the local administration duties. Local Stanitsa and Khutor atamans were elected, but approved by the atamans of the otdel. These, in turn, were appointed by the supreme ataman of the host, who was in turn appointed directly by the Russian Emperor. Prior to 1870, this system of legislature in the Oblast remained a robust military one and all legal decisions were carried out by the stanitsa ataman and two elected judges. Afterwards, however, the system was bureaucratised and the judicial functions became independent of the stanitsas.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}\n\nThe more liberal policy of the Kuban was directly mirrored in the living standards of the people. One of the central features of this was education. Indeed, the first schools were known to have existed since the migration of the Black Sea Cossacks, and by 1860, the host had one male high school and 30 elementary schools.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} In 1863, the first periodical \u041a\u0443\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u0432\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0441\u0442\u0438 - ''Kubanskiye voiskovye vedomsti'' began printing, and two years later the host's library was opened in Yekaterinodar. In all, by 1870, the number of schools in rural stanitsas increased to 170. Compared with the rest of the Russian Empire, by the start of the 20th century the Oblast had a very high literacy rate of 50% and each year up to 30 students from Cossack families (again a rate unmatched by any other rural province) were sent to study in the [[Education in Russia|higher education establishments of Russia]].\n\nDuring the early twentieth century contacts between Kuban and Ukraine were established and clandestine Ukrainian organizations appeared in Kuban.<ref name=\"Procyk\"/><!--\nHowever, frictions with the Tsarist administration was also widespread. During the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] the pro-liberal reforms effectively split the Caucasus lines by creating an independent [[Stavropol Oblast]], which was settled by rural peasants seeking to colonise the new lands, which were forcibly confiscated from the Cossacks. These migrations led to a large [[Armenians in Kuban|Armenian]] and [[Ukrainians in Kuban|Ukrainian]] minorities to form. Such that by 1888, the non-Cossack share of Kuban Oblast was 48%. Other administrative reforms, prevented the Cossacks from colonising regions of the Kuban such as its Black Sea Coast, where a separate [[Black Sea Governorate]] existed. Nonetheless, it was a Kuban Cossack, that used his body as a human shield to protect the Emperor in 1881 assassination, wounded mortally by the blast, it was the Tsar's own insistence to leave the carriage and thank the dying Cossack that allowed the terrorists to through the second bomb which ultimately took the Emperor's life as well.-->\n\n===Uniform and equipment===\n[[File:Kubanskie Kazaki.jpg|thumb|Kuban Cossacks in 1915.]]\nUntil 1914 the Kuban Cossack Host wore a full dress uniform comprising a dark grey/black [[kaftan]] (knee length collarless coat) with red shoulder straps and braiding on the wide cuffs. Ornamental containers (''gaziri'') which had originally contained single loading measures of gunpowder for muzzle-loading muskets, were worn on the breasts of the kaftans.

A black felt cloak (''bourki'') was worn in bad weather both in peace-time and on active service.\n\nThe Kuban and Terek Cossacks of the Imperial Escort (''Konvoi'') wore a special gala uniform; including a scarlet kaftan edged with gold braid and a white waistcoat.<ref>{{cite book|first=Vladimir A.|last=Emmanuel|page=12|title=The Russian Imperial Cavalry in 1914|ISBN=978-0-9889532-1-5}}</ref>\n\n===Russian Revolution and Civil War===\nDuring the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and resulting [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]], the Cossacks found themselves conflicted in their loyalties. In October 1917, the [[Kuban Soviet Republic]] and the [[Kuban Rada]] were formed simultaneously, with both proclaiming their right to rule the Kuban. Shortly after the Rada declared a [[Kuban National Republic]], but this was soon dispersed by Bolshevik forces. While most Cossacks initially sided with the Rada, many joined the Bolsheviks who promised them autonomy.\n[[File:Nicholas II and children with Cossacks of the Guard.jpg|thumb|left|Kuban Cossacks of the Imperial Escort pose with [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and his family.]]\n\nIn March 1918, after [[Lavr Kornilov]]'s successful offensive, the Kuban Rada placed itself under his authority. With his death in June 1918, however, a federative union was signed with the Ukrainian government of Hetman [[Pavlo Skoropadsky]] after which many Cossacks left to return home or defected to the Bolsheviks. Additionally, there was an internal struggle among the Kuban cossacks over loyalty towards [[Anton Denikin]]'s [[Volunteer Army|Russian Volunteer Army]] and the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]].\n\nOn 6 November 1919, Denikin's forces surrounded the Rada, and with the help of Ataman [[Alexander Filimonov (Cossack)|Alexander Filimonov]] arrested ten of its members, including the [[Ukrainophile]], P.

After the German defeat at [[Stalingrad]], the 4th Guards Kuban Cossack Corps, strengthened by tanks and artillery, broke through the German lines and liberated [[Mineralnye Vody]], and [[Stavropol]].\n\nFor the latter part of the war, although the Cossacks did prove especially useful in reconnaissance and rear guards, the war did show that the age of horse cavalry had come to an end. The famous 4th Guards Kuban Cossack Regiment which took part in heavy fighting in the course of the liberation of Southern Ukraine and Romania was allowed to proudly march on the [[Red Square]] in the famous [[Victory parade]] of 1945.\n\n==Modern Kuban Cossacks==\n[[File:Flag of Kuban People's Republic.svg|right|thumb|150px|Flag of the Kuban Cossacks]]\nFollowing the war, the Cossack regiments, along with remaining cavalry were disbanded and removed from the Soviet armed forces as they were thought to be obsolete.\n\nStarting in the late 1980s, there were renewed efforts to revive Cossack traditions which went to great lengths; in 1990, the Host was once again recognised by the Supreme [[Ataman]] of the [[Don Cossacks|All-Great Don Host]] (\u0412\u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u043e\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e \u0414\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435). At this time some pro-Ukrainian sentiment emerged among some Kuban Cossack leaders.  For example, when in May 1993 Cossack leader Yevhen Nahai was arrested and accused of plotting a coup, another Cossack leader (kish otaman Pyuypenko) threatened to call for support for Ukraine if Nahai's rights were violated. A march of cossack cavalry from eastern Ukraine to Kuban was met with some enthusiasm by locals.<ref>Serhiy Plokhy.(2008). ''Ukraine and Russia: Representations of the Past''.

The latter conflict was in particular special for the Kuban Cossacks, initially a number of Cossacks fled from the de-Cossackization repressions of the 1920s and assimilated with the [[Abkhaz people]]. Before the [[Georgian-Abkhaz Conflict]] there was a strong movement of creating an Abkhaz-Kuban Host among the descendants. When the civil war broke out, 1500 Kuban Cossack volunteers from Russia came to aid the Abkhaz side. One of the notable groups was the 1st [[sotnia]] under the command of Ataman Nikolay Pusko which reportedly completely destroyed a Ukrainian volunteer group fighting on the Georgian side and then went on to be the first to enter Sukhumi in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|last=Perov|first=Sergei|url=http://www.newizv.ru/news/2004-02-11/4562/|script-title=ru:\u041a\u0443\u0431\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0435 \u043a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u043a\u0438 \u0431\u0435\u0440\u0443\u0442 \u0421\u0443\u0445\u0443\u043c\u0438 -\u0413\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0440 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u0422\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432 \u0432\u0437\u044f\u043b\u0441\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0440\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0430\u0431\u0445\u0430\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043c\u044b|trans-title=Kuban Cossacks take Sukhumi - Governor Alexander Tkachov has taken on the solution to the Abkhazian problem|language=ru|publisher=Newizv.ru|location=Krasnodar Krai|date=11 February 2004|accessdate=25 April 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714025831/http://www.newizv.ru/news/2004-02-11/4562/|archivedate=14 July 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Since then, a detachment of Kuban Cossacks continue to inhabit Abkhazia, and their presence continues to influence the [[Georgian-Russian relations]].\n\nAccording to human rights reports from the 1990s, the Cossacks regularly harassed non-Russians, such as Armenians and Chechens, living in southern Russia.<ref>[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/topic,463af2212,49709c7d2,3ae6a6b57,0.html Russia: Cossacks and their role in Sochi (Krasnodar Krai)].

It was composed of seven subdivisions (''otdels''), and numbered 1.3 million people (278 ''stanitsas'' and 32 ''khutors''). Kuban Cossacks formed regular units of the Imperial Russian Army as listed below. The following lists the structure prior to the outbreak of World War I, although this would be re-organised during the conflict (see foot-note).\n\nIn peacetime the Host provided 10 horse regiments making up a Kuban Cossack division, six ''plastun'' (infantry) battalions and six horse-artillery batteries; in addition to irregular and support units. The \"first\" regiments were linked to the specific locales that they were recruited from, although they would often be deployed elsewhere in the Empire. In wartime, recruits were drafted from each region to form \"second\" regiments during the stage of initial mobilization. If further manpower was required, a \"third\" regiment would be formed to be dispatched as reinforcements. During World War One a total of 37 horse (cavalry) regiments were raised by the Kuban Cossack Host.\n \n[[File:Map of Kuban Oblast (1916).jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 1916 map of Kuban Oblast with the neighboring [[Black Sea Governorate]] and part of [[Sukhumi Okrug]] {{in lang|ru}}]]\n\n'''Regiments:'''\n* 1st and 2nd Kuban Life Guard sotnias of His Imperial Majesty's personal convoy (a special unit of the [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Imperial Guard]] acting for personal protection of the monarch)\n* 1st Khopyor regiment \"Her Imperial Highness [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna]]\"\n* 1st Kuban regiment \"General Field Marshal [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich]]\"\n* 1st Zaporozhian regiment \"Empress [[Catherine the Great]]\"\n* 1st Yekaterinodar regiment \"Kosh Ataman [[Zakhary Chepiha|Chepiga]]\"\n* 1st Poltavskaya regiment \"Yekatrinoslav Viceroy General Field Marshal Prince [[Grigory Potemkin|Potyomkin-Tavrichesky]]\"\n* 1st Umanskaya regiment \"Brigadier [[Antin Holovaty|Golovaty]]\"\n* 1st Taman regiment \"General [[Alexey Bezrkovny|Bezkrovny]]\"\n* 1st Laba regiment \"General [[Grigory Zas|Zass]]\"\n* 1st Line regiment \"General [[Nikolaya Velyaminov|Velyaminov]]\"\n* 1st Black Sea regiment \"Colonel [[Fyodor Bursak|Bursak]]\"\n\n'''Divisions:'''\n* Kuban Cossack Division (after the outbreak of World War I, the Russian Army began reforming this system along modern lines, but only one division was in existence in 1914)\n\n'''Plastuns:'''\n* 1st Kuban [[plastun]] battalion \"General Field Marshal [[Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich]]\"\n* 2nd through 6th Kuban plastun battalions\n\nAs noted the ''plastun'' units served as infantry.
