The club had won the '''Calcutta Football League''' this season and became the runners of 2015 [[Sheikh Kamal International Club Cup]].\n\n==Pre-Season Overview==\nThe club signed [[Do Dong-hyun]], a South Korean attacking mid-fielder to support the stricking part.\nWith the arrival of veteran defender [[Bello Razaq]] from [[Mohun Bagan]], the team became stronger and the '''Red and Gold Brigade''' are hoping to seal the '''CFL''' championship and set another hexa record.\nWith the help of recent performances, The Club clinched to the '''74th spot''' in the recent [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] Club Ranking, the highest among all Indian football clubs.\n\n==Season Overview==\n\n===August===\nThe club started their '''Calcutta Football League''' campaign on 8 August by beating [[SVF Tollygunge Agragami FC]] by '''1-0'''. In the next match, against [[Aryan F.C.]], the club managed a draw, the only draw of this '''CFL''' campaign. Then they went on winning all the matches against [[Bengal Nagpur Railway]], Army XI, [[Mohammedan S.C. (Kolkata)]], Police AC and [[Sports Authority of India]].\n\n===September===\nMaintaining their winning streak of August, '''East Bengal''' started their September by beating [[Kalighat Milan Sangha F.C.]] by 4-3. This fixture was their toughest in this campaign as at a time, the team was trailing by 0-2 and then they managed to win it. <br />\nThe next fixture of the club was a prestigious [[Kolkata Derby]] against their arch rivals [[Mohun Bagan]] in which the team managed an easy 4-0 win with two stunning free kicks by [[Do Dong-hyun]], the top scorer of the club, one of which came in just after 82 seconds from the kick off.

The team draw set '''East Bengal''' in Group B on the fixture of this tour. Due to the absence of almost all the main and first team players of the club (all out on loan in different clubs of [[Indian Super League]]), the junior and reserve bench players had taken part in it.

Chow described the 27\u201324 win as \"joyless\", but following a tough loss to former WAC foe [[Rice Owls football|Rice]], the 'Bows put together the best performance of the season with a wild 38\u201328 win over [[Wyoming Cowboys football|Wyoming]], capturing the [[Paniolo Trophy]] for the first time since 1992. But the team fell apart, culminating in a disheartening 28\u201321 loss to [[Fresno State Bulldogs football|Fresno State]] following a wild 37\u201335 victory over [[UNLV Rebels football|UNLV]]. The loss salted already smashed hopes of a division title, ending the 'Bows season at 4\u20139.\n*'''2015''' \u2013 The season started out with a big win for the program over [[Colorado Buffaloes football|Colorado]] but the team slumped to 2\u20137 and [[Norm Chow]] was fired following a program-worst 51-point conference home loss to Air Force, 58\u20137, with the Falcons retaining the Kuter Trophy. [[Chris Naeole]] was named the interim head coach the Sunday following the game. Later, defensive coordinator [[Tom Mason (American football)|Tom Mason]] was reassigned to an administrative role before the season finale. But the Rainbow Warriors fought on, winning their final game of the season and finishing with an overall record of 3\u201310.

Hawaii spends the season with alternating quarterback play, with [[Cole McDonald]] starting 13 games, and Chevan Cordeiro starting 2 and replacing McDonald as starter in 10 of McDonald's 13 starts. Hawaii wins their conference game against [[2019 San Diego State Aztecs football team|San Diego State]] 14\u201311, clinching their first division title in the history of Hawaii's play in the [[Mountain West Conference]].

Hawaii finishes the season 10\u20135, their first ten win season since 2010, and just the seventh in program history.

Coaches from both schools have accused each side of various episodes of poor sportsmanship over the years, and both schools have some of the nation's rowdiest home fans. The rivalry has featured some lopsided results, including a 70\u201314 Fresno victory over [[2004 Hawaii Warriors football team|Hawai\u02bbi]] in [[2004 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2004]] and a 68\u201337 [[2006 Hawaii Warriors football team|Warriors]] victory in [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006]] over [[2006 Fresno State Bulldogs football team|Fresno]]. In [[2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2007]], allegations that [[2007 Fresno State Bulldogs football team|Fresno State]] fans were physically and verbally abused by hometown [[2007 Hawaii Warriors football team|Hawai\u02bbi]] fans circulated the internet and television media added to this rivalry.\n\nIt was being reported that several Fresno State fans attempted to warn Boise State fans from attending Hawai{{okina}}i football games due to potential violence against them, however no incidents were reported by Boise State fans and many photographs from Hawai{{okina}}i-based publications covered incidents where Hawai{{okina}}i and Boise State fans were seen mingling together before and after their 2007 game. The rivalry still continues to be one that is anticipated by both sides and continues to the present, with Fresno State having joined the [[Mountain West Conference]] in 2012, reuniting it with Hawai\u02bbi and other former WAC members in Nevada and Boise State.\n\n===Air Force===\n{{Main|Air Force\u2013Hawaii football rivalry}}\nThis is one of the oldest rivalries involving Hawaii, along with the Fresno State rivalry. This rivalry is attributed to the late General Laurence S. Kuter, who was stationed on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam as commander of the Pacific Air Forces. This led to the creation of the Kuter Trophy, a symbol of sportsmanship and school pride, but also the eternal friendship between the Air Force and Hawaii. The Rainbow Warriors are currently in possession of the trophy following a 34\u201327 double overtime road win, the first in Colorado Springs since 1992 and first win versus Air Force since 2001.\n\n===Wyoming===\n{{Main|Hawaii\u2013Wyoming football rivalry}}\n[[Wyoming Cowboys football|Wyoming]] and Hawaii play for the Paniolo Trophy. The rivalry was renewed in 2013 after 15 years when Hawaii joined the Mountain West Conference in 2012. Because the two teams could not find the original trophy, a new trophy was modeled after a statue that currently stands in [[Kamuela|Waimea]] on the Big Island at the Parker Ranch Center. Wyoming won that game in Laramie 59\u201356 in overtime. Before that, the last time the two schools met was in 1997 in the old Western Athletic Conference with Wyoming winning 35\u20136 in Honolulu. Hawaii currently holds the Paniolo Trophy as they won the most recent meeting, 38\u201328 in Honolulu.

Coaches from both schools have accused each side of various episodes of poor sportsmanship over the years, and both schools have some of the nation's rowdiest home fans. The rivalry has featured some lopsided results, including a 70\u201314 Fresno victory over [[2004 Hawaii Warriors football team|Hawai\u02bbi]] in [[2004 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2004]] and a 68\u201337 [[2006 Hawaii Warriors football team|Warriors]] victory in [[2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2006]] over [[2006 Fresno State Bulldogs football team|Fresno]]. In [[2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2007]], allegations that [[2007 Fresno State Bulldogs football team|Fresno State]] fans were physically and verbally abused by hometown [[2007 Hawaii Warriors football team|Hawai\u02bbi]] fans circulated the internet and television media added to this rivalry.\n\nIt was being reported that several Fresno State fans attempted to warn Boise State fans from attending Hawai{{okina}}i football games due to potential violence against them, however no incidents were reported by Boise State fans and many photographs from Hawai{{okina}}i-based publications covered incidents where Hawai{{okina}}i and Boise State fans were seen mingling together before and after their 2007 game. The rivalry still continues to be one that is anticipated by both sides and continues to the present, with Fresno State having joined the [[Mountain West Conference]] in 2012, reuniting it with Hawai\u02bbi and other former WAC members in Nevada and Boise State.\n\n===Air Force===\n{{Main article|Air Force\u2013Hawaii football rivalry}}\nThis is one of the oldest rivalries involving Hawaii, along with the Fresno State rivalry. This rivalry is attributed to the late General Laurence S. Kuter, who was stationed on Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam as commander of the Pacific Air Forces. This led to the creation of the Kuter Trophy, a symbol of sportsmanship and school pride, but also the eternal friendship between the Air Force and Hawaii. The Rainbow Warriors are currently in possession of the trophy following a 34\u201327 double overtime road win, the first in Colorado Springs since 1992 and first win versus Air Force since 2001.\n\n===Wyoming===\n{{Main article|Hawaii\u2013Wyoming football rivalry}}\n[[Wyoming Cowboys football|Wyoming]] and Hawaii play for the Paniolo Trophy. The rivalry was renewed in 2013 after 15 years when Hawaii joined the Mountain West Conference in 2012. Because the two teams could not find the original trophy, a new trophy was modeled after a statue that currently stands in [[Kamuela|Waimea]] on the Big Island at the Parker Ranch Center.
