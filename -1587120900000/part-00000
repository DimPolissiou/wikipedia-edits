It is situated within the wider [[Touraine AOC]] wine appellation. It is produced by ten communes bordering both sides of the [[Loire (river)|River Loire]]. To their west lies the town of [[Amboise]] with its famous [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise|royal ch\u00e2teau]].  Since its separation from the Touraine AOC in 1954, it has constituted an AOC in its own right. Annual production stands at 9,000 hectolitres of wine, spread between red, ros\u00e9, and still white wines. Effervescent wines are also produced within this AOC's boundaries, but they are not entitled to use the Touraine-Amboise appellation, belonging instead to the Touraine appellation.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=253BF80AC172B4A02D2A1B95BF132C20.tpdjo11v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000021164008&dateTexte=&oldAction=rechJO&categorieLien=id D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2009-1253 du 16 octobre 2009]</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Prehistory and Antiquity ===\n[[File:Vitis vinifera sylvestris Habitus SierraMadrona.jpg|thumb|Wild Vine]]\nThere is evidence that people were living on the sloping hillsides of this middle stretch of the Loire as early as [[palaeolithic]] and [[neolithic]] times.  The Ch\u00e2telliers plateau, on the edge of which the Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise is built, contains one of the Loire region's most important [[Chass\u00e9en culture|Chass\u00e9en]] neolithic sites.<ref>Le site chass\u00e9en du plateau des Ch\u00e2telliers \u00e0 Amboise \u2013 G Cordier \u2013 ''Revue arch\u00e9ologique du centre de la France'' \u2013 Jou\u00e9-l\u00e8s-Tours \u2013 1995 \u2013 V34 \u2013 pp. 109\u2013155</ref> An [[axe]] made with local stone and a [[dagger]] made with stone from the [[Le Grand-Pressigny|Grand-Pressigny]] region, have been discovered to the west of the market town of Limeray.<ref>Christian Guyon (conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et maire d'Amboise, ''Le canton d'Amboise'', published ca 2002, p. 24</ref> Significant permanent settlements seem to have grown up at the start of the [[Bronze Age]] (approximately 5,000 years BC), while large-scale planting of the valleys dates from the final period of the Bronze Age, between 1,200 and 750 BC.<ref>''Guide bleu Hachette'', Centre, 1991, pp. 58\u201359</ref> At that time, following the last glacial period, vines already existed in their wild state as a kind of creeper growing on the edges of forests and on stony soils, but wine-making was as yet undiscovered.\n\nIn the first century AD the geographer, [[Pliny the Elder]] (23\u201379 AD), described [[viticulture|wine-growing]] in [[Gaul]] as well-developed, but made no specific mention of wines produced along the banks of the Loire.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'', XIV</ref> Whereas the [[Nantes]] wine-growing area dates back to the Roman occupation, popular tradition links the start of vine cultivation in the province of [[Touraine]] (in the middle section of the Loire's course) to the founding of [[Marmoutier Abbey (Tours)|Marmoutier Abbey]] by [[Martin of Tours|St Martin]] in 372 AD. [[Decline of the Roman Empire|The fall of the Roman empire]], and the turbulent centuries of the [[early Middle Ages]] that followed, interrupted the development of wine production, and the use of wine was restricted to religious practices and medical applications, in both cases dispensed by monasteries. This was documented by [[Sulpicius Severus]], writing about meals at Marmoutier Abbey at the end of the 4th century: \"Everyone gathered to break the fast and eat together; there was no wine provided except when illness demanded it\".<ref>[[Sulpicius Severus]], ''Life of saint Martin'', ch. X</ref> Several legends about the effects of drinking wine or pruning vines are linked to St Martin of Tours.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n[[File:Monk tasting wine from a barrel.jpg|thumb|Monk tasting his wine]]\n\nNo information is available regarding wine-growing or wine production in the area directly around Amboise during the [[Middle Ages]].  One can only make deductions from what is known of the wine-growing history of the region, and assume that local circumstances would not have differed greatly.\n\nIn the High Middle Ages, the oldest record seems to be that of [[Gregory of Tours]] who described the damage caused to the vines by bad weather in the spring of 587.  He refers on several occasions to vines growing near to the [[Basilica of St. Martin, Tours|Basilica of St Martin of Tours]]. At the time the Basilica owned the villa at [[Nazelles-N\u00e9gron|Nazelles]] close to Amboise, but there is no way of ascertaining whether the latter was planted with vines at that period.<ref>Gr\u00e9goire de Tours, ''Histoire des Francs'', \u00e9dition des Belles lettres, collection \u00abClassiques de l'Histoire\u00bb, Paris, 1980</ref>\n\nFrom the 11th century onwards the majority of monasteries and abbeys strung out along the banks of the [[Loire (river)|Loire]] were involved in wine-growing, taking full advantage of the opportunity for transporting wine by river. A text dating from this time describes how a cleric from [[Chinon]] used this mode of transport to take his wine to [[Nantes]].<ref group=\"N\">Issue de ''La vie et les miracles de saint Mexme'' XI<sup>e</sup>, cit\u00e9 dans ''Les vins de Loire'', \u00c9ditions Montalba, 1979, p. 31</ref>\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nThe popularity of Touraine wines was due in no small part to the earthy writings of the French author, [[Rabelais]], and his panegyric, \"The Divine Bottle\":\n{{poemquote|...In the liquor so divine,\nContained within your loins,\nBacchus, conqueror of India,\nLies all truth enclosed.<ref>\u0152uvres de Ma\u00eetre Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais \u2013 Livre cinq \u2013 Jean de Bonnot \u2013 1973 \u2013 extrait de la chanson de la dive bouteille \u2013 p139</ref>}}\n\nAmboise wines were especially enjoyed by the French king, [[Louis XI]], who published a [[charter]] stipulating that Amboise wines should be sold before all other wines at the market in [[Tours]].<ref>Cit\u00e9 par la Commanderie des Grands Vins d'Amboise sur son site officiel</ref> In 1477 he also introduced an annual gift of one hundred muids (one muid equalled eight French cubic feet) of wine to the monks of [[Canterbury]] Church.<ref>Jules Tardif, Archives nationales de France, 1977</ref> Touraine wine was also routinely served at the table of the French king, [[Francis I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]], who was apparently moved to comment: \"Even though I was not born in Amboise, I grew up there, and all my life the taste of that divine draft from the beautiful city of [[Tours]], so dear to my heart, has remained with me\".<ref>Citation figurant sur la contre \u00e9tiquette des vins de la Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9, domaine de Serge et Pascal Bonnigal</ref>\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Francois Rabelais - Portrait.jpg|Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais\nFile:Louis XI of France.jpg|Louis XI of France\nFile:Canterburycathedrale.JPG|Canterbury Cathedral \nFile:Fran\u00e7ois Ier Louvre.jpg|Fran\u00e7ois I of France\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n=== Modern Period ===\n[[File:Colbert1666.jpg|thumb|Jean-Baptiste Colbert]]\n[[File:Arr\u00eat Vin Amboise.JPG|thumb|1722 ruling regarding absence on leave from the Amboise wine transportation]]\n\nTwo main factors contributed to the growth of Touraine wines between the 16th and 19th century.  The first was a decree issued by the Paris parliament on 14 August 1577, forbidding Paris wine merchants to obtain their supplies from anywhere within twenty [[league (unit)|leagues]]<ref group=\"N\">Avant 1674, il s'agissait de l'ancienne [[lieue]] de Paris, d'une longueur de {{Formatnum:3248}} m\u00e8tres, soit une distance d'environ 65&nbsp;km.</ref> of the city.<ref group=\"N\">Interdiction annul\u00e9e en 1776 par un \u00e9dit royal.</ref> Since the [[Loire Valley]] was easily accessible by road from the capital, demand rapidly increased firstly in the province of [[Orl\u00e9anais]], then in the province of Touraine.  The second factor was the popularity of the Loire Valley's white wines with [[Holland|Dutch]] buyers. The latter installed agents, charged with overseeing their imports at close quarters, in several [[Loire Valley]] trading posts, including [[Amboise]].\n\nTo all intents and purposes, the Dutch agents were middle-men, stocking and selling on French wines to the whole world and making a considerable profit in the process. [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] (Louis XIV's finance minister) attempted to break their monopoly by creating a trading company that could deal directly with the markets. The Dutch retaliated by levying a heavy surcharge on various French manufactured articles, as well as French brandy and wine.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Cochut, ''Le minist\u00e8re de Colbert'', Revue des Deux Mondes, T.15, 1846 [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Minist%C3%A8re_de_Colbert Wikisource]</ref> Exports slowed down, with the regrettable result that the focus of production shifted from quality to quantity. A further undesirable effect was that cereal crops were often abandoned in favour of wine-growing, regardless of the land's suitability.<ref>{{harvsp|Robert de La Croix|1979|pp=36\u201337}}</ref>\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\nAt the start of the 19th century wine-growing became one of the mainstays of the local economy. For this reason the devastation caused by the dual scourge of [[mildew]] and [[phylloxera]] that hit the region in 1882 came as a particularly heavy blow. The extent of the damage was even greater because the wine-growers initially refused to pull up their vines, trying instead to treat them with [[carbon disulfide]], though without success.\n:\"As far as the phylloxera is concerned, the wine-growers were wrong, at the start, not to fight it.''They allowed it to get completely out of hand.  '' ''Nevertheless the wine-growers' unions have succeeded at many levels in keeping production at full capacity.  '' ''In the Touraine area, however, there is no such flurry of activity.  '' ''In his report to the General Council of the department of Indre-et-Loire, the Prefet (official in charge of a French department) does not even mention the situation.  '' ''The general reaction is one of complete indifference. The local temperament militates against any attempt to take effective action, and at the same time political animosities are distracting everyone from the true problems of this region. However, the Touraine wine-growing area has already lost many vines and there are frequent cases of vines being pulled up''.<ref group=\"N\">En fait pr\u00e8s de la moiti\u00e9 des vignes seront arrach\u00e9es</ref> A vast fortune is disappearing\".<ref>Ardouin Dumazet, Voyage en France, Berger-Levrault, 1910 [Ardouin Dumazet, A Journey through France, etc.]</ref><ref group=\"N\">There is, however, a vine in the Touraine region, planted around 1850 and rediscovered in 1998, that successfully resisted phylloxera and is now probably the oldest vine in France.</ref>\n\nFollowing the introduction of new grape varieties, grafted onto American rootstocks, the vineyards were built up again between 1901 and 1905. In spite of these measures, the decline continued with a series of crises caused firstly by the collapse of stock market prices in 1906\u20131907, then by over-production in 1922\u20131923. It was only after the Second World War that the tide began to turn, thanks to improvements in quality due to the use of \"noble\" grape varieties, and increased demand for quality effervescent wines as an alternative to [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]]. The growth of tourism was also a crucial in boosting sales of the wine produced.\n\n;Award of AOC status\n\nIn 1954, the wine-growing area located around the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise]], which was originally classed as part of the \"Coteaux-de-Touraine\"<ref>Devenue en 1953 Touraine (AOC)|l'AOC touraine</ref> [[Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e|AOC]] by the decree passed on 24 December 1939, was granted its own appellation of Touraine-Amboise. The new appellation originally covered nine communes in the department of [[Indre-et-Loire]], three on the left bank of the [[Loire (river)|Loire]] ([[Amboise]], [[Charg\u00e9]] and [[Mosnes]]) and six on the right bank ([[Cangey]], [[Limeray]], [[Poc\u00e9-sur-Cisse]], [[Nazelles-N\u00e9gron]], [[Saint-Ouen-les-Vignes]] and [[Montreuil-en-Touraine]]). The commune of [[Saint-R\u00e8gle]] (on the left bank) was added to the appellation by the decree of 2 August 2005.<ref>[http://www.inao.gouv.fr/public/produits/showTexte.php?comiteNat=1&id_txt=636 D\u00e9cret officiel de constitution de l'AOC]</ref> In 1967 the Commanderie des Grands Vins d'Amboise (the Order of the Great Wines of Amboise) was established to ensure that the wines were well promoted.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe etymological origins of the Touraine-Amboise appellation are relatively self-explanatory. It is made up of the name of the former province of [[Touraine]] (which derived its name from its Gallic inhabitants, the [[Turones]]<ref group=\"N\">Selon certaines sources, l'oppidum d'Amboise pourrait m\u00eame avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 la cit\u00e9 d'origine des Turones</ref>), combined with the name of the town of Amboise, the most famous of the appellation's constituent communes.\n\n==Geographical location==\n[[File:Carte vignoble vallee de la loire.png|thumb|center|upright=3|Wine-growing areas of the Loire Valley]]\n\n===Orography===\nThe territory of the communes of the Touraine-Amboise AOC consists primarily of a [[plateau]] that lies between 105 and 130 metres above sea level. This is divided in two by the wide valley of the Loire, which lies, on average, at about 55 metres above sea level and is bordered on either side by often steeply sloping hillsides.<ref name=\"GEO\">[Notice de la carte g\u00e9ologique d'[[Amboise]] (XIX-22) publi\u00e9e par le [[Bureau de recherches g\u00e9ologiques et mini\u00e8res]]</ref>\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Kleine feuersteine.jpg|thumb|Different kinds of silex]]\nThe wide valley of the Loire is made up of a mixture of [[sand]] and [[silt]] that is carried along by the river.<ref name=\"GEO\" /> The slopes on either side are made up of a mixture of [[clay]]s and other elements that have come down from the plateau areas. The wine-growing area is mainly located on the two-halves of the plateau and, occasionally, on the upper slopes to either side of the valley. The plateau areas are covered in a thin layer of clay-sand silt that has been deposited there by the wind. Beneath this silt lies a polygenetic [[puddingstone (rock)|puddingstone]] dating from the Upper [[Eocene]] Age, mixed with varicoloured clays and small pebbles of rolled [[silex]], [[Jurassic]] [[chert]]s and [[quartz]] grains. The soils of this wine-growing [[terroir]] can be carbonate, overlying tuffeau stone on the higher slopes, or, more frequently, silicate and fairly heavy, overlying sands and clay gravels.<ref>Terroirs et vins de France.

A series of east-west facing [[valleys]], where the continental influence is less harsh, present ideal conditions for the creation of [[microclimate]]s that are especially favourable to wine-growing.\n\nThe nearest [[weather station]] with readings that can be accessed is in [[Tours]].\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Touraine-Amboise\n|Jan high C = 6.9\n|Feb high C = 8.2\n|Mar high C = 11.3\n|Apr high C = 14.3\n|May high C = 18.1\n|Jun high C = 21.7\n|Jul high C = 24.6\n|Aug high C = 24.3\n|Sep high C = 21.4\n|Oct high C = 16.7\n|Nov high C = 10.5\n|Dec high C = 7.4\n|year high C = 15.4\n|Jan low C = 1.6\n|Feb low C = 2.0\n|Mar low C = 3.3\n|Apr low C = 5.0\n|May low C = 8.4\n|Jun low C = 11.4\n|Jul low C = 13.1\n|Aug low C = 12.9\n|Sep low C = 10.8\n|Oct low C = 7.9\n|Nov low C = 3.8\n|Dec low C = 2.3\n|year low C = 6.9\n|Jan precipitation mm = 63.3\n|Feb precipitation mm = 61.6\n|Mar precipitation mm = 54.3\n|Apr precipitation mm = 51.4\n|May precipitation mm = 67.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 47.5\n|Jul precipitation mm = 53.0\n|Aug precipitation mm = 40.9\n|Sep precipitation mm = 54.3\n|Oct precipitation mm = 61.0\n|Nov precipitation mm = 63.0\n|Dec precipitation mm = 65.9\n|year precipitation mm = 683.7\n|source 1 = Infoclimat : Tours<ref>[http://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie/?s=07240&d=2004-01-01 Relev\u00e9s infoclimat de Tours]\n</ref>\n|date=August 2010\n}}\n\n[[File:Global Warming Predictions fr.png|230px|right]]\nPossible consequences of global warming\nAccording to the conclusions of two studies published in the [[United States]] (one of which was conducted by the [[Colmar]] branch of l'[[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique|INRA]] (Institut National de Recherche Agronomique or French National Institute for Agricultural Research) on the consequences of [[global warming]] for wine-growing, the [[Loire Valley]] wine-growing area should be one of the prime beneficiaries of the gradual increase in temperatures. Basing their calculations on [[Sotheby's]] auction statistics, these studies suggest that in the last ten years the optimum temperature for producing quality wine has already been reached in most French wine-growing areas, but that there is a margin for potential improvement of about 0.8&nbsp;\u00b0C along the banks of the Loire. If these conclusions are right, the wines of this region could, in fact, reach their peak without the need for any changes in the grape varieties grown<ref>{{in lang|en}} E. Duch\u00eane et C.

The bottom wire of the trellis must be no more than 0.55 metres above the ground. The AOC status only applies to wines produced from the harvest gathered two years after the year in which the vines were planted (before 31 August).\n\n==== Pruning ====\n[[File:Pr\u00e9taille vigne.JPG|thumb|Vines that have undergone mechanized pre-pruning]]\nPruning generally takes place once the leaves have fallen in November, and continues throughout the winter months.  Mechanized pre-pruning is carried out first, using a high-clearance tractor, and this cuts the time spent pruning manually by about a quarter.  The following pruning methods are permitted:\n* The so-called \"Guyot simple\" or \"Single Guyot\" pruning: a single cane with five to eight buds and a single spur with one to three buds, the maximum total of renewal buds allowed per vine being eleven;\n* The Taille \u00e0 trois bras or Three-armed pruning: a long branch with a maximum of seven renewal buds, and spurs, each with a maximum of three renewal buds, totalling no more than eleven renewal buds per vine.\n* The Taille courte or Short pruning: spurs bearing a maximum of three renewal buds and one optional spur bearing four renewal buds, the total number of renewal buds allowed per vine being no more than thirteen.\nThe numbers of buds stipulated above apply to vines spaced up to one metre apart within the row.  The number of buds per vine may be increased by one renewal bud for every 0.2 metres of additional spacing.\n\nPruning has become less strenuous and time-consuming since the introduction of electric and pneumatic [[loppers|secateurs]]. The cuttings produced by pruning are shredded to form a mulch or burnt in situ.  Pruning and trellising are the only tasks that wine-growers still carry out completely by hand.\n\n==== Cultivation ====\nThe work of cultivation falls into two main categories:\n* Mechanized operations, such as ploughing, which aerates the soil and helps to keep down the weeds, and hedging, which removes the upper sections of the shoots in order to increase the vines' exposure to the sun and make them less susceptible to disease.\n* Chemical treatments, using [[pesticide]]s and [[herbicide]]s, in order to protect the vines against cryptogamic diseases such as [[mildew]], [[Uncinula necator|oidium]], grey rot, etc., and against [[insect]]s such as the [[Eudemis]] and the [[Cochylis]].  Every effort is made to minimize the environmental effects of these procedures.\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Mildew-back.JPG|Mildew\nFile:UncinulaNecatorOnGrapes.jpg|Oidium\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==== Harvesting ====\n[[File:Img1415 Vendanges C\u00f4te Chalonnaise.jpg|thumb|Grape Harvester]]\nThe harvest usually begins in the second week of September and continues through to the first weeks of October.  Over the last fifteen years or so, the use of mechanized harvesters has become increasingly common, especially since virtually all the wine-growing area lies on level ground.  As a result, manual harvesting has virtually died out.\n\n====Wine-making and maturing====\nThe following are the usual wine-making methods employed. However, it should be remembered that there can be slight variations in the methods used by individual wine-makers within the AOC.\n\n===== Red wine-making =====\n[[File:GrandPressoir.JPG|thumb|left|Old press from the Touraine region in the Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]]\n[[File:Composite fermentation tanks.jpg|thumb|Fermentation tanks]]\n\nThe grapes are [[harvest (wine)|harvest]]ed, either manually or by machine, when they are fully ripe. Sometimes grapes that have been harvested manually are sorted, either on the vines or at a sorting table on the wine-maker's premises, to ensure that rotten or insufficiently ripe grapes are removed.<ref name=\"VITI\">''Conduite et gestion de l'exploitation agricole'', cours de viticulture du lyc\u00e9e viticole de Beaune (1999\u20132001). Baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel option viticulture-oenologie.</ref> Grapes that have been harvested manually are usually crushed, then transferred to a tank. Pre-fermentation cold maceration is sometimes carried out. [[Ethanol fermentation|Alcoholic fermentation]] can then begin, normally after the addition of [[yeast (wine)|yeast]]. The next stage is the extraction of [[phenols in wines|polyphenol]]s (tannins and anthocyanins) and other chemical constituents of the grapes. In the past this was carried out by a process called [[pigeage]], which involved repeatedly pushing the floating cap of grape solids back down into the fermenting juice. Now, however, extraction is normally brought about by a series of remontages. This involves pumping the juice from the bottom of the tank, then pouring it over the cap of grape solids to wash out the grapes' distinctive constituents. The temperature for alcoholic fermentation can be varied, but the normal average temperature at the height of fermentation is between 28 and 35 degrees Celsius. If the naturally generated temperature is too low, [[chaptalization]] may be carried out. This practice is subject to external regulations. Once alcoholic fermentation has finished, the liquid is removed from the tank and separated into [[free-run wine and press wine]]. [[Malolactic fermentation]] may take place next, but is dependent on temperature. The wine is drawn off and stored in barrels or vats to be matured.  The maturing process takes several months (6 to 24 months),<ref name=\"VITI\"/> after which the wine is fined, filtered and bottled.\n\n=====Ros\u00e9 wine-making=====\n[[File:Mise en bouteille (vin).jpg|thumb|Bottling machine]]\n[[Harvest (wine)|Harvesting]] is manual or mechanized. Two different methods may be used, either the direct pressing method (to produce a pressed ros\u00e9 wine) or the method whereby the harvested red grapes are put in a tank and red wine maceration begins, but some of the juice is then bled off (to produce a bled ros\u00e9 wine). [[Alcoholic fermentation]] takes place in tanks, as for white wine, and temperatures, [[chaptalization]], etc. are carefully controlled. This is followed by [[malolactic fermentation]]. The wine is matured in vats, or sometimes in barrels. Lastly, the wine is filtered and bottled.\n\n===== White wine-making =====\nAs with red wine-making, harvesting is manual or mechanized, and may include sorting. The grapes are then transferred into a press to be pressed.  Once the grape must is in the tank, the sludge is removed, normally after certain enzymes have been added. At this stage pre-fermentation cold stabulation (at temperatures between 10 and 12&nbsp;\u00b0C for several days) may be carried out in order to promote the extraction of aromas.  Normally, however, after 12 to 48 hours, the clear juice is drawn off and left to ferment. [[Alcoholic fermentation]] continues under supervision, particular attention being paid to the temperature, which must remain more or less stable (between 18 and 24 degrees Celsius).<ref name=\"VITI\" /> If necessary, chaptalization is also carried out in order to boost the alcoholic strength by volume. [[Malolactic fermentation]] and maturing then take place in barrels or in vats. Once this process is completed, the wine is filtered in order to clarify it.

These limits may be adjusted in line with changing climate conditions.\n\nEven when enrichment with dry sugar ([[chaptalization]]) has been authorized, a maximum total alcoholic strength by volume of 12.5% may not be exceeded.\n\nSugar content\nThe Touraine-Amboise AOC wines cannot be considered properly matured if their sugar content is less than 153&nbsp;grams per litre of must.  For sparkling white wines the amount should be 136&nbsp;grams per litre of must.\n\n=== Terroir and wines ===\nThe soil is made up of alternating \"perruches\" and \"aubuis\" soils,<ref name=\"VDL1\">[http://www.vinsdeloire.fr/vins_vdl/fiche_aoc.aspx?ID=3b255aeb-3503-4f6a-b19d-b940151bb690 Touraine Amboise -AOC par d\u00e9cret du 24 d\u00e9cembre 1939], sur ''www.vinsdeloire.fr'', consult\u00e9 le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2009.</ref> as they are called in French. Perruches are clays combined with silica, which warm up quickly and are the reason why these wines have a flinty taste. Aubuis are a mixture of permeable, fertile, calcereous clays, which give the wine its powerful character and are perfectly suited to white grape varieties.\n\n=== Business structure ===\nOne of the features of this AOC is the large number of small family concerns, despite the gradual disappearance of very small plots farmed by retired people or those in paid employment, for whom wine-production was only a means of supplementing their main income.\n\n=== Type of wine and gastronomy ===\n\n==== Types of wines ====\n[[File:Bouteille touraine-amboise.JPG|thumb|Bottle of Touraine-Amboise wine awarded a Golden Bacchus]]\n* The red wines are fruity and balanced with depth of colour. They should be served at between 14&nbsp;\u00b0C and 16&nbsp;\u00b0C and can be used as an accompaniment to game, meats and cheeses. They can be kept on average for 2 to 5 years, longer for batches that have been aged in oak barrels.\n* The ros\u00e9 wines come from the same grape varieties as the red wines, but have a shorter maceration period and are bottled very much sooner. They have aromas of small red fruits, and should be served at between 10&nbsp;\u00b0C and 12&nbsp;\u00b0C. They complement starters and grilled meats.\n* The still white wines are either dry, medium dry, or medium sweet, depending on the amount of sunshine the grapes have absorbed.  They have a supple, sometimes dense taste, with fresh fruit and citrus aromas. The dry wines should be served at 10&nbsp;\u00b0C with fish and seafood, while the medium dry wines are better suited to fish prepared with a sauce or to cooked and cured meats. The medium sweet wines go particularly well with foie gras and desserts. Alternatively they can be served as an aperitif. On average they can be kept for between 2 and 5 years.\n;Touraine AOC wines\n\n* The effervescent wines carry the double designation of \"[[M\u00e9thode Traditionnelle]]\" (produced by traditional methods), which means that they are very fruity and ideal for the preparation of kirs, and \"[[Cr\u00e9mant de Loire]]\" (or sparkling wine from the Loire region) which makes them the ideal way to end a meal.\n\n=== Marketing ===\n\nMarketing is largely carried out directly by the wine-growers from their wine cellars that are usually hollowed out of the local [[tufa|tuffeau]] rock, and by the Cellier L\u00e9onard de Vinci<ref>[http://www.cellier-leonard-de-vinci.com/index.htm Cellier L\u00e9onard de Vinci] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407001051/http://www.cellier-leonard-de-vinci.com/index.htm |date=7 April 2010 }}</ref> (Leonardo da Vinci Wine Cellar) in [[Limeray]], a [[winemaking cooperative]] set up in 1931 by Charles Bellamy and some local wine-growers under the name \"Cave des vignerons de Limeray\" (Limeray Wine-growers Cellar), and renamed in 1995. Customer sales are managed by the ''Caveau des vignerons d'Amboise''<ref>[http://caveauvins-amboise.monsite.wanadoo.fr/ Caveau des vins d'Amboise]</ref> (Amboise Wine-growers Vault), located immediately below the [[Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise]], as well as by various shops in Amboise and the surrounding towns.\n\nWine fairs are organized on a regular basis at Easter and in the week of 15 August (the Feast of the Assumption is a public holiday in France), and are held in a tunnel dug out of the tuffeau rock beneath the Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise.\n\nThe first or second Sunday of July is reserved for a gourmet walk of about 5&nbsp;km around the vineyards of the village of Limeray. The walk is in aid of humanitarian causes and is organized with the help of the [[Lions Clubs International|Lions Club of Amboise les Deux Vall\u00e9es]]. This gives the [[winemaker|wine-growers]], in conjunction with the Commanderie des Grans Vins d'Amboise (the Order of the Great Wines of Amboise) and the region's gastronomical guilds, an opportunity to showcase local wines and other specialities from the Touraine region.<ref>[http://monsite.wanadoo.fr/LIONS_CLUB_AMBOISE/page8.html Renseignements sur la promenade gourmande de Limeray :]</ref>\n\n==The Order of the Great Wines of Amboise==\n[[File:Confr\u00e9rie Saint-Etienne.jpg|thumb|The Order of the Great Wines of Amboise being welcomed at a reception given by Alsace's Saint-Etienne Guild.]]\nLa Commanderie des Grands Vins d'Amboise (the Order of the Great Wines of Amboise) is a guild for the promotion of fine wines founded on 15 April 1967 by a team of wine-growers who were backed by [[Michel Debr\u00e9]], honorary president of the Syndicat des Vins de Touraine Amboise (Touraine-Amboise wine-growers' union).\n\nThe Order derives its name from an order of the Hospitaller Knights of St John of Jerusalem,<ref group=\"N\">Elle avait pour nom exact \u00ab Commanderie de Saint-Jean de l'Isle-l\u00e8s-Amboise \u00bb</ref> who were based on the Ile d'Or<ref group=\"N\">Anciennement appel\u00e9e \u00eele saint-Jean du fait de la pr\u00e9sence de cette commanderie</ref> (Island of Gold), at the foot of the [[Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise]], during the [[Middle Ages]]. The Order has as its motto \"Nos Roys l'ont aym\u00e9\" (mediaeval French for \"Our kings loved it\"), a reference to [[Louis XI|Louis XI's]] [[charter]] decreeing that Amboise wine should be sold before all other kinds at the market in [[Tours]].  The order's purpose is to promote wines from the Touraine-Amboise appellation area in Europe and throughout the world.\n\nUnder the terms of a ministerial order issued on 11 August 2003 [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf//jopdf/2003/143/JO200314360ALL.pdf], the Order is one of ten French guilds for the promotion of fine wines that are authorized to confer competition prize-winning honours, in this case \"Bacchus d'Or\" (Golden Bacchus), on still wines.\n\nTraditionally the Order holds two chapter meetings each year:\n* The rotating chapter in honour of [[Vincent of Saragossa|St Vincent]], patron saint of wine-growers, which moves between each of the ten communes of the appellation in turn.  At this chapter meeting the most long-standing and most well-deserving wine-growers in the village are honoured.\n* The harvest chapter meeting, held in the Croix-Douillard wine cellars in Amboise, at which wine-growers can be enthroned at their own request.\n\n==Touraine-Amboise wines in French literature==\n[[File:Vendange 1900.png|thumb|Harvesting in M\u00e9lie's time]]\nThe writer of regional literature, Robert Morin (1893\u20131925) was the author of ''M\u00e9lie Butteli\u00e8re'' (M\u00e9lie the Basket Carrier), which was published posthumously in 1926. In the 1920s Morin lived in the M\u00e9nard manor house at [[Poc\u00e9-sur-Cisse]]. His heroine, M\u00e9lie, lived half way up a hillside in a cave-dwelling between the hamlets of Fourchette and Monc\u00e9 in [[Limeray]], right in the heart of the present AOC wine-growing area. Her job was to carry the soil washed down the hillsides by the rain back up the slopes again, earthing up the base of each vine. The small basket she used was known locally as a \"buttelet\", and is the root of the word \"butteli\u00e8re\" (basket carrier), M\u00e9lie's job title.  By depicting a few brief scenes from her existence, the author painted a vivid picture of the lives and characterful speech of the local wine-growing community in the early 20th century.\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n=== Notes ===\n<references group=\"N\"/>\n\n=== References ===\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://vinsdeloire.info/texts/touraine-amboise Information on the AOC Touraine Amboise ]\n* [http://www.commanderie-vins-amboise.com/ Commanderie des Grands Vins d'Amboise]\n* [http://caveauvins-amboise.monsite.wanadoo.fr/ Wine Cellar d'Amboise]\n* [http://www.ville-amboise.fr/descriptionStructure.php?id=473&amp;domaine=3&amp;famille=79&amp;theme=&amp;activite= Wines in the town of Amboise]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100407001051/http://www.cellier-leonard-de-vinci.com/index.htm Cellier Leonardo da Vinci]\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Cite book\n  | last = de la Croix\n  | first = Robert\n  | title = Les vins de Loire et les vins du Jura\n  | publisher = \u00c9ditions Montalba\n  | year = 1979\n  | isbn = 978-2-85870-016-5}}\n\n[[Category:Loire AOCs]]\n[[Category:Indre-et-Loire]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox Wine Region\n| name = Touraine-Ambois\n| image = Vignoble poc\u00e9.JPG\n| official name =\n| type = AOC\n| year = 1954\n| country = [[France]]\n| sub regions =\n| climate region = oceanic and continental\n| heat units =\n| precipitation =\n| soil = containing carbonates on tuffeau on the higher slopes, or siliceous and fairly heavy on sands and gravels mixed with clay\n| total size =\n| planted = 220 ha\n| vineyards =\n| grapes = red: [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[C\u00f4t]] and [[Gamay]]; white: [[Chenin blanc]]\n| varietals =\n| designation =\n}}\n\n'''Touraine-Amboise''' is an ''[[Appellation d'Origine Contr\u00f4l\u00e9e]]'' (AOC) for in the [[Loire Valley (wine)|Loire Valley wine region]] in [[France]].

To their west lies the town of [[Amboise]] with its famous [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise|royal ch\u00e2teau]].  Since its separation from the Touraine AOC in 1954, it has constituted an AOC in its own right. Annual production stands at 9,000 hectolitres of wine, spread between red, ros\u00e9, and still white wines. Effervescent wines are also produced within this AOC's boundaries, but they are not entitled to use the Touraine-Amboise appellation, belonging instead to the Touraine appellation.<ref>[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=253BF80AC172B4A02D2A1B95BF132C20.tpdjo11v_1?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000021164008&dateTexte=&oldAction=rechJO&categorieLien=id D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2009-1253 du 16 octobre 2009]</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Prehistory and Antiquity ===\n[[File:Vitis vinifera sylvestris Habitus SierraMadrona.jpg|thumb|Wild Vine]]\nThere is evidence that people were living on the sloping hillsides of this middle stretch of the Loire as early as [[palaeolithic]] and [[neolithic]] times.  The Ch\u00e2telliers plateau, on the edge of which the Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise is built, contains one of the Loire region's most important [[Chass\u00e9en culture|Chass\u00e9en]] neolithic sites.<ref>Le site chass\u00e9en du plateau des Ch\u00e2telliers \u00e0 Amboise \u2013 G Cordier \u2013 ''Revue arch\u00e9ologique du centre de la France'' \u2013 Jou\u00e9-l\u00e8s-Tours \u2013 1995 \u2013 V34 \u2013 pp. 109\u2013155</ref> An [[axe]] made with local stone and a [[dagger]] made with stone from the [[Le Grand-Pressigny|Grand-Pressigny]] region, have been discovered to the west of the market town of Limeray.<ref>Christian Guyon (conseiller g\u00e9n\u00e9ral et maire d'Amboise, ''Le canton d'Amboise'', published ca 2002, p. 24</ref> Significant permanent settlements seem to have grown up at the start of the [[Bronze Age]] (approximately 5,000 years BC), while large-scale planting of the valleys dates from the final period of the Bronze Age, between 1,200 and 750 BC.<ref>''Guide bleu Hachette'', Centre, 1991, pp. 58\u201359</ref> At that time, following the last glacial period, vines already existed in their wild state as a kind of creeper growing on the edges of forests and on stony soils, but wine-making was as yet undiscovered.\n\nIn the first century AD the geographer, [[Pliny the Elder]] (23\u201379 AD), described [[viticulture|wine-growing]] in [[Gaul]] as well-developed, but made no specific mention of wines produced along the banks of the Loire.<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'', XIV</ref> Whereas the [[Nantes]] wine-growing area dates back to the Roman occupation, popular tradition links the start of vine cultivation in the province of [[Touraine]] (in the middle section of the Loire's course) to the founding of [[Marmoutier Abbey (Tours)|Marmoutier Abbey]] by [[Martin of Tours|St Martin]] in 372 AD. [[Decline of the Roman Empire|The fall of the Roman empire]], and the turbulent centuries of the [[early Middle Ages]] that followed, interrupted the development of wine production, and the use of wine was restricted to religious practices and medical applications, in both cases dispensed by monasteries. This was documented by [[Sulpicius Severus]], writing about meals at Marmoutier Abbey at the end of the 4th century: \"Everyone gathered to break the fast and eat together; there was no wine provided except when illness demanded it\".<ref>[[Sulpicius Severus]], ''Life of saint Martin'', ch. X</ref> Several legends about the effects of drinking wine or pruning vines are linked to St Martin of Tours.\n\n=== Middle Ages ===\n[[File:Monk tasting wine from a barrel.jpg|thumb|Monk tasting his wine]]\n\nNo information is available regarding wine-growing or wine production in the area directly around Amboise during the [[Middle Ages]].  One can only make deductions from what is known of the wine-growing history of the region, and assume that local circumstances would not have differed greatly.\n\nIn the High Middle Ages, the oldest record seems to be that of [[Gregory of Tours]] who described the damage caused to the vines by bad weather in the spring of 587.  He refers on several occasions to vines growing near to the [[Basilica of St. Martin, Tours|Basilica of St Martin of Tours]]. At the time the Basilica owned the villa at [[Nazelles-N\u00e9gron|Nazelles]] close to Amboise, but there is no way of ascertaining whether the latter was planted with vines at that period.<ref>Gr\u00e9goire de Tours, ''Histoire des Francs'', \u00e9dition des Belles lettres, collection \u00abClassiques de l'Histoire\u00bb, Paris, 1980</ref>\n\nFrom the 11th century onwards the majority of monasteries and abbeys strung out along the banks of the [[Loire (river)|Loire]] were involved in wine-growing, taking full advantage of the opportunity for transporting wine by river. A text dating from this time describes how a cleric from [[Chinon]] used this mode of transport to take his wine to [[Nantes]].<ref group=\"N\">Issue de ''La vie et les miracles de saint Mexme'' XI<sup>e</sup>, cit\u00e9 dans ''Les vins de Loire'', \u00c9ditions Montalba, 1979, p. 31</ref>\n\n=== Renaissance ===\nThe popularity of Touraine wines was due in no small part to the earthy writings of the French author, [[Rabelais]], and his panegyric, \"The Divine Bottle\":\n{{poemquote|...In the liquor so divine,\nContained within your loins,\nBacchus, conqueror of India,\nLies all truth enclosed.<ref>\u0152uvres de Ma\u00eetre Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais \u2013 Livre cinq \u2013 Jean de Bonnot \u2013 1973 \u2013 extrait de la chanson de la dive bouteille \u2013 p139</ref>}}\n\nAmboise wines were especially enjoyed by the French king, [[Louis XI]], who published a [[charter]] stipulating that Amboise wines should be sold before all other wines at the market in [[Tours]].<ref>Cit\u00e9 par la Commanderie des Grands Vins d'Amboise sur son site officiel</ref> In 1477 he also introduced an annual gift of one hundred muids (one muid equalled eight French cubic feet) of wine to the monks of [[Canterbury]] Church.<ref>Jules Tardif, Archives nationales de France, 1977</ref> Touraine wine was also routinely served at the table of the French king, [[Francis I of France|Fran\u00e7ois I]], who was apparently moved to comment: \"Even though I was not born in Amboise, I grew up there, and all my life the taste of that divine draft from the beautiful city of [[Tours]], so dear to my heart, has remained with me\".<ref>Citation figurant sur la contre \u00e9tiquette des vins de la Pr\u00e9v\u00f4t\u00e9, domaine de Serge et Pascal Bonnigal</ref>\n\n<br>\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Francois Rabelais - Portrait.jpg|Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais\nFile:Louis XI of France.jpg|Louis XI of France\nFile:Canterburycathedrale.JPG|Canterbury Cathedral \nFile:Fran\u00e7ois Ier Louvre.jpg|Fran\u00e7ois I of France\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n=== Modern Period ===\n[[File:Colbert1666.jpg|thumb|Jean-Baptiste Colbert]]\n[[File:Arr\u00eat Vin Amboise.JPG|thumb|1722 ruling regarding absence on leave from the Amboise wine transportation]]\n\nTwo main factors contributed to the growth of Touraine wines between the 16th and 19th century.  The first was a decree issued by the Paris parliament on 14 August 1577, forbidding Paris wine merchants to obtain their supplies from anywhere within twenty [[league (unit)|leagues]]<ref group=\"N\">Avant 1674, il s'agissait de l'ancienne [[lieue]] de Paris, d'une longueur de {{Formatnum:3248}} m\u00e8tres, soit une distance d'environ 65&nbsp;km.</ref> of the city.<ref group=\"N\">Interdiction annul\u00e9e en 1776 par un \u00e9dit royal.</ref> Since the [[Loire Valley]] was easily accessible by road from the capital, demand rapidly increased firstly in the province of [[Orl\u00e9anais]], then in the province of Touraine.  The second factor was the popularity of the Loire Valley's white wines with [[Holland|Dutch]] buyers. The latter installed agents, charged with overseeing their imports at close quarters, in several [[Loire Valley]] trading posts, including [[Amboise]].\n\nTo all intents and purposes, the Dutch agents were middle-men, stocking and selling on French wines to the whole world and making a considerable profit in the process. [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert|Colbert]] (Louis XIV's finance minister) attempted to break their monopoly by creating a trading company that could deal directly with the markets. The Dutch retaliated by levying a heavy surcharge on various French manufactured articles, as well as French brandy and wine.<ref>Andr\u00e9 Cochut, ''Le minist\u00e8re de Colbert'', Revue des Deux Mondes, T.15, 1846 [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Minist%C3%A8re_de_Colbert Wikisource]</ref> Exports slowed down, with the regrettable result that the focus of production shifted from quality to quantity. A further undesirable effect was that cereal crops were often abandoned in favour of wine-growing, regardless of the land's suitability.<ref>{{harvsp|Robert de La Croix|1979|pp=36\u201337}}</ref>\n\n=== Contemporary history ===\nAt the start of the 19th century wine-growing became one of the mainstays of the local economy. For this reason the devastation caused by the dual scourge of [[mildew]] and [[phylloxera]] that hit the region in 1882 came as a particularly heavy blow. The extent of the damage was even greater because the wine-growers initially refused to pull up their vines, trying instead to treat them with [[carbon disulfide]], though without success.\n:\"As far as the phylloxera is concerned, the wine-growers were wrong, at the start, not to fight it.''They allowed it to get completely out of hand.  '' ''Nevertheless the wine-growers' unions have succeeded at many levels in keeping production at full capacity.  '' ''In the Touraine area, however, there is no such flurry of activity.  '' ''In his report to the General Council of the department of Indre-et-Loire, the Prefet (official in charge of a French department) does not even mention the situation.  '' ''The general reaction is one of complete indifference. The local temperament militates against any attempt to take effective action, and at the same time political animosities are distracting everyone from the true problems of this region. However, the Touraine wine-growing area has already lost many vines and there are frequent cases of vines being pulled up''.<ref group=\"N\">En fait pr\u00e8s de la moiti\u00e9 des vignes seront arrach\u00e9es</ref> A vast fortune is disappearing\".<ref>Ardouin Dumazet, Voyage en France, Berger-Levrault, 1910 [Ardouin Dumazet, A Journey through France, etc.]</ref><ref group=\"N\">There is, however, a vine in the Touraine region, planted around 1850 and rediscovered in 1998, that successfully resisted phylloxera and is now probably the oldest vine in France.</ref>\n\nFollowing the introduction of new grape varieties, grafted onto American rootstocks, the vineyards were built up again between 1901 and 1905. In spite of these measures, the decline continued with a series of crises caused firstly by the collapse of stock market prices in 1906\u20131907, then by over-production in 1922\u20131923. It was only after the Second World War that the tide began to turn, thanks to improvements in quality due to the use of \"noble\" grape varieties, and increased demand for quality effervescent wines as an alternative to [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]]. The growth of tourism was also a crucial in boosting sales of the wine produced.\n\n;Award of AOC status\n\nIn 1954, the wine-growing area located around the [[Ch\u00e2teau d'Amboise]], which was originally classed as part of the \"Coteaux-de-Touraine\"<ref>Devenue en 1953 Touraine (AOC)|l'AOC touraine</ref> [[Appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e|AOC]] by the decree passed on 24 December 1939, was granted its own appellation of Touraine-Amboise. The new appellation originally covered nine communes in the department of [[Indre-et-Loire]], three on the left bank of the [[Loire (river)|Loire]] ([[Amboise]], [[Charg\u00e9]] and [[Mosnes]]) and six on the right bank ([[Cangey]], [[Limeray]], [[Poc\u00e9-sur-Cisse]], [[Nazelles-N\u00e9gron]], [[Saint-Ouen-les-Vignes]] and [[Montreuil-en-Touraine]]). The commune of [[Saint-R\u00e8gle]] (on the left bank) was added to the appellation by the decree of 2 August 2005.<ref>[http://www.inao.gouv.fr/public/produits/showTexte.php?comiteNat=1&id_txt=636 D\u00e9cret officiel de constitution de l'AOC]</ref> In 1967 the Commanderie des Grands Vins d'Amboise (the Order of the Great Wines of Amboise) was established to ensure that the wines were well promoted.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe etymological origins of the Touraine-Amboise appellation are relatively self-explanatory. It is made up of the name of the former province of [[Touraine]] (which derived its name from its Gallic inhabitants, the [[Turones]]<ref group=\"N\">Selon certaines sources, l'oppidum d'Amboise pourrait m\u00eame avoir \u00e9t\u00e9 la cit\u00e9 d'origine des Turones</ref>), combined with the name of the town of Amboise, the most famous of the appellation's constituent communes.\n\n==Geographical location==\n[[File:Carte vignoble vallee de la loire.png|thumb|center|upright=3|Wine-growing areas of the Loire Valley]]\n\n===Orography===\nThe territory of the communes of the Touraine-Amboise AOC consists primarily of a [[plateau]] that lies between 105 and 130 metres above sea level. This is divided in two by the wide valley of the Loire, which lies, on average, at about 55 metres above sea level and is bordered on either side by often steeply sloping hillsides.<ref name=\"GEO\">[Notice de la carte g\u00e9ologique d'[[Amboise]] (XIX-22) publi\u00e9e par le [[Bureau de recherches g\u00e9ologiques et mini\u00e8res]]</ref>\n\n===Geology===\n[[File:Kleine feuersteine.jpg|thumb|Different kinds of silex]]\nThe wide valley of the Loire is made up of a mixture of [[sand]] and [[silt]] that is carried along by the river.<ref name=\"GEO\">[Notice de la carte g\u00e9ologique d'Amboise (XIX-22) publi\u00e9e par le Bureau de recherches g\u00e9ologiques et mini\u00e8res</ref> The slopes on either side are made up of a mixture of [[clay]]s and other elements that have come down from the plateau areas. The wine-growing area is mainly located on the two-halves of the plateau and, occasionally, on the upper slopes to either side of the valley. The plateau areas are covered in a thin layer of clay-sand silt that has been deposited there by the wind. Beneath this silt lies a polygenetic [[puddingstone (rock)|puddingstone]] dating from the Upper [[Eocene]] Age, mixed with varicoloured clays and small pebbles of rolled [[silex]], [[Jurassic]] [[chert]]s and [[quartz]] grains. The soils of this wine-growing [[terroir]] can be carbonate, overlying tuffeau stone on the higher slopes, or, more frequently, silicate and fairly heavy, overlying sands and clay gravels.<ref>Terroirs et vins de France.

Basing their calculations on [[Sotheby's]] auction statistics, these studies suggest that in the last ten years the optimum temperature for producing quality wine has already been reached in most French wine-growing areas, but that there is a margin for potential improvement of about 0.8&nbsp;\u00b0C along the banks of the Loire. If these conclusions are right, the wines of this region could, in fact, reach their peak without the need for any changes in the grape varieties grown<ref>{{in lang|en}} E. Duch\u00eane et C.

The bottom wire of the trellis must be no more than 0.55 metres above the ground. The AOC status only applies to wines produced from the harvest gathered two years after the year in which the vines were planted (before 31 August).\n\n==== Pruning ====\n[[File:Pr\u00e9taille vigne.JPG|thumb|Vines that have undergone mechanized pre-pruning]]\nPruning generally takes place once the leaves have fallen in November, and continues throughout the winter months.  Mechanized pre-pruning is carried out first, using a high-clearance tractor, and this cuts the time spent pruning manually by about a quarter.  The following pruning methods are permitted:\n* The so-called \"Guyot simple\" or \"Single Guyot\" pruning: a single cane with five to eight buds and a single spur with one to three buds, the maximum total of renewal buds allowed per vine being eleven;\n* The Taille \u00e0 trois bras or Three-armed pruning: a long branch with a maximum of seven renewal buds, and spurs, each with a maximum of three renewal buds, totalling no more than eleven renewal buds per vine.\n* The Taille courte or Short pruning: spurs bearing a maximum of three renewal buds and one optional spur bearing four renewal buds, the total number of renewal buds allowed per vine being no more than thirteen.\nThe numbers of buds stipulated above apply to vines spaced up to one metre apart within the row.  The number of buds per vine may be increased by one renewal bud for every 0.2 metres of additional spacing.\n\nPruning has become less strenuous and time-consuming since the introduction of electric and pneumatic [[loppers|secateurs]]. The cuttings produced by pruning are shredded to form a mulch or burnt in situ.  Pruning and trellising are the only tasks that wine-growers still carry out completely by hand.\n\n==== Cultivation ====\nThe work of cultivation falls into two main categories:\n* Mechanized operations, such as ploughing, which aerates the soil and helps to keep down the weeds, and hedging, which removes the upper sections of the shoots in order to increase the vines' exposure to the sun and make them less susceptible to disease.\n* Chemical treatments, using [[pesticide]]s and [[herbicide]]s, in order to protect the vines against cryptogamic diseases such as [[mildew]], [[Uncinula necator|oidium]], grey rot, etc., and against [[insect]]s such as the [[Eudemis]] and the [[Cochylis]].  Every effort is made to minimize the environmental effects of these procedures.\n\n<center>\n<gallery>\nFile:Mildew-back.JPG|Mildew\nFile:UncinulaNecatorOnGrapes.jpg|Oidium\n</gallery>\n</center>\n\n==== Harvesting ====\n[[File:Img1415 Vendanges C\u00f4te Chalonnaise.jpg|thumb|Grape Harvester]]\nThe harvest usually begins in the second week of September and continues through to the first weeks of October.  Over the last fifteen years or so, the use of mechanized harvesters has become increasingly common, especially since virtually all the wine-growing area lies on level ground.  As a result, manual harvesting has virtually died out.\n\n====Wine-making and maturing====\nThe following are the usual wine-making methods employed. However, it should be remembered that there can be slight variations in the methods used by individual wine-makers within the AOC.\n\n===== Red wine-making =====\n[[File:GrandPressoir.JPG|thumb|left|Old press from the Touraine region in the Ch\u00e2teau de Chenonceau]]\n[[File:Composite fermentation tanks.jpg|thumb|Fermentation tanks]]\n\nThe grapes are [[harvest (wine)|harvest]]ed, either manually or by machine, when they are fully ripe. Sometimes grapes that have been harvested manually are sorted, either on the vines or at a sorting table on the wine-maker's premises, to ensure that rotten or insufficiently ripe grapes are removed.<ref name=\"VITI\">''Conduite et gestion de l'exploitation agricole'', cours de viticulture du lyc\u00e9e viticole de Beaune (1999\u20132001). Baccalaur\u00e9at professionnel option viticulture-oenologie.</ref> Grapes that have been harvested manually are usually crushed, then transferred to a tank. Pre-fermentation cold maceration is sometimes carried out. [[Ethanol fermentation|Alcoholic fermentation]] can then begin, normally after the addition of [[yeast (wine)|yeast]]. The next stage is the extraction of [[phenols in wines|polyphenol]]s (tannins and anthocyanins) and other chemical constituents of the grapes. In the past this was carried out by a process called [[pigeage]], which involved repeatedly pushing the floating cap of grape solids back down into the fermenting juice. Now, however, extraction is normally brought about by a series of remontages. This involves pumping the juice from the bottom of the tank, then pouring it over the cap of grape solids to wash out the grapes' distinctive constituents. The temperature for alcoholic fermentation can be varied, but the normal average temperature at the height of fermentation is between 28 and 35 degrees Celsius. If the naturally generated temperature is too low, [[chaptalization]] may be carried out. This practice is subject to external regulations. Once alcoholic fermentation has finished, the liquid is removed from the tank and separated into [[free-run wine and press wine]]. [[Malolactic fermentation]] may take place next, but is dependent on temperature. The wine is drawn off and stored in barrels or vats to be matured.  The maturing process takes several months (6 to 24 months),<ref name=\"VITI\"/> after which the wine is fined, filtered and bottled.\n\n=====Ros\u00e9 wine-making=====\n[[File:Mise en bouteille (vin).jpg|thumb|Bottling machine]]\n[[Harvest (wine)|Harvesting]] is manual or mechanized. Two different methods may be used, either the direct pressing method (to produce a pressed ros\u00e9 wine) or the method whereby the harvested red grapes are put in a tank and red wine maceration begins, but some of the juice is then bled off (to produce a bled ros\u00e9 wine). [[Alcoholic fermentation]] takes place in tanks, as for white wine, and temperatures, [[chaptalization]], etc. are carefully controlled. This is followed by [[malolactic fermentation]]. The wine is matured in vats, or sometimes in barrels. Lastly, the wine is filtered and bottled.\n\n===== White wine-making =====\nAs with red wine-making, harvesting is manual or mechanized, and may include sorting. The grapes are then transferred into a press to be pressed.  Once the grape must is in the tank, the sludge is removed, normally after certain enzymes have been added. At this stage pre-fermentation cold stabulation (at temperatures between 10 and 12&nbsp;\u00b0C for several days) may be carried out in order to promote the extraction of aromas.  Normally, however, after 12 to 48 hours, the clear juice is drawn off and left to ferment. [[Alcoholic fermentation]] continues under supervision, particular attention being paid to the temperature, which must remain more or less stable (between 18 and 24 degrees Celsius).<ref name=\"VITI\" /> If necessary, chaptalization is also carried out in order to boost the alcoholic strength by volume. [[Malolactic fermentation]] and maturing then take place in barrels or in vats. Once this process is completed, the wine is filtered in order to clarify it. The final stage of the whole operation is the bottling of the wine.\n\n=== Yields ===\nThe minimum and maximum [[Yield (wine)|yield]]s for the AOC, stipulated by the decree of 12 July 1994,<ref>Article 4 du d\u00e9cret du 12 juillet 1994 relatif \u00e0 l'appellation d'origine contr\u00f4l\u00e9e << Touraine >> \u2013 J.O Numero 165 du 19 juillet 1994.</ref> are as follows:\n\n<center>\n{| bgcolor=\"#FF8080 cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- Bgcolor=\"#FF8080\"\n| Bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" align=\"left\" | Yield per hectare\n| Bgcolor=\"#FF8080\" align=\"center\" | Red\n| Bgcolor=\"#FFB2B2\" align=\"center\" | Rose\n| Bgcolor=\"#F4E2BA\" align=\"center\" | White\n| Bgcolor=\"#90FF80\" align \"center\" | Sparkling\n|-bgcolor=\"#FFB2B2\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#EBF5FF\"\n|align=\"left\" |Performance Based||align=\"center\"|55 hl/ha||align=\"center\"|55 hl/ha||align=\"center\"|60 hl/ha||align=\"center\"|78 hl/ha\n|-\n|align=\"left\" |Return target||align=\"center\"|67 hl/ha||align=\"center\"|67hl/ha||align=\"center\"|70 hl/ha||align=\"center\"|78 hl/ha\n|}\n</center>\n\n===Minimum and maximum alcoholic strength by volume===\nThe Touraine-Amboise AOC wines must come from well-ripened grape harvests and must have the following natural alcoholic strengths by volume:\n\n<center>\n{| Bgcolor=\"#FF8080 cellpadding=\"3\" cellspacing=\"1\" border=\"2\" style=\"font-size: 95%; border: gray solid 1px; border-collapse: collapse;\"\n|- Bgcolor=\"#FF8080\"\n| Bgcolor=\"#FFFFFF\" align=\"center\" | alcohol by volume\n| Bgcolor=\"#FF8080\" align=\"center\" | Red\n| Bgcolor=\"#FFB2B2\" align=\"center\" | Rose\n| Bgcolor=\"#F4E2BA\" align=\"center\" | White\n| Bgcolor=\"#90FF80\" align=\"center\" | Sparkling\n|-bgcolor=\"#FFB2B2\"\n|-bgcolor=\"#EBF5FF\"\n| align=\"left\"|Minimal||align=\"center\"|9.5% vol || align=\"center\"|9.5% vol ||align=\"center\"|10% vol || align=\"center\"|8.5% vol\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|Maximum||align=\"center\"|12.5% vol||align=\"center\"|12.5% vol||align=\"center\"|12.5% vol||align=\"center\"|12.5% vol\n|}\n</center>\n[[File:Alcoolm\u00e8tre.JPG|thumb|Early 20th century alcohol meter]]\nThe upper limit may be exceeded, provided the wine has been made without enrichment of any kind, and provided an investigation by the [[Institut National des Appellations d'Origine|INAO]] has been requested by the wine-grower, carried out and filed prior to the harvesting of the vines in question. These limits may be adjusted in line with changing climate conditions.\n\nEven when enrichment with dry sugar ([[chaptalization]]) has been authorized, a maximum total alcoholic strength by volume of 12.5% may not be exceeded.\n\nSugar content\nThe Touraine-Amboise AOC wines cannot be considered properly matured if their sugar content is less than 153&nbsp;grams per litre of must.  For sparkling white wines the amount should be 136&nbsp;grams per litre of must.\n\n=== Terroir and wines ===\nThe soil is made up of alternating \"perruches\" and \"aubuis\" soils,<ref name=\"VDL1\">[http://www.vinsdeloire.fr/vins_vdl/fiche_aoc.aspx?ID=3b255aeb-3503-4f6a-b19d-b940151bb690 Touraine Amboise -AOC par d\u00e9cret du 24 d\u00e9cembre 1939], sur ''www.vinsdeloire.fr'', consult\u00e9 le 3 d\u00e9cembre 2009.</ref> as they are called in French. Perruches are clays combined with silica, which warm up quickly and are the reason why these wines have a flinty taste. Aubuis are a mixture of permeable, fertile, calcereous clays, which give the wine its powerful character and are perfectly suited to white grape varieties.\n\n=== Business structure ===\nOne of the features of this AOC is the large number of small family concerns, despite the gradual disappearance of very small plots farmed by retired people or those in paid employment, for whom wine-production was only a means of supplementing their main income.\n\n=== Type of wine and gastronomy ===\n\n==== Types of wines ====\n[[File:Bouteille touraine-amboise.JPG|thumb|Bottle of Touraine-Amboise wine awarded a Golden Bacchus]]\n* The red wines are fruity and balanced with depth of colour. They should be served at between 14&nbsp;\u00b0C and 16&nbsp;\u00b0C and can be used as an accompaniment to game, meats and cheeses. They can be kept on average for 2 to 5 years, longer for batches that have been aged in oak barrels.\n* The ros\u00e9 wines come from the same grape varieties as the red wines, but have a shorter maceration period and are bottled very much sooner. They have aromas of small red fruits, and should be served at between 10&nbsp;\u00b0C and 12&nbsp;\u00b0C. They complement starters and grilled meats.\n* The still white wines are either dry, medium dry, or medium sweet, depending on the amount of sunshine the grapes have absorbed.  They have a supple, sometimes dense taste, with fresh fruit and citrus aromas. The dry wines should be served at 10&nbsp;\u00b0C with fish and seafood, while the medium dry wines are better suited to fish prepared with a sauce or to cooked and cured meats. The medium sweet wines go particularly well with foie gras and desserts. Alternatively they can be served as an aperitif. On average they can be kept for between 2 and 5 years.\n;Touraine AOC wines\n\n* The effervescent wines carry the double designation of \"[[M\u00e9thode Traditionnelle]]\" (produced by traditional methods), which means that they are very fruity and ideal for the preparation of kirs, and \"[[Cr\u00e9mant de Loire]]\" (or sparkling wine from the Loire region) which makes them the ideal way to end a meal.\n\n=== Marketing ===\n\nMarketing is largely carried out directly by the wine-growers from their wine cellars that are usually hollowed out of the local [[tufa|tuffeau]] rock, and by the Cellier L\u00e9onard de Vinci<ref>[http://www.cellier-leonard-de-vinci.com/index.htm Cellier L\u00e9onard de Vinci] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100407001051/http://www.cellier-leonard-de-vinci.com/index.htm |date=7 April 2010 }}</ref> (Leonardo da Vinci Wine Cellar) in [[Limeray]], a [[winemaking cooperative]] set up in 1931 by Charles Bellamy and some local wine-growers under the name \"Cave des vignerons de Limeray\" (Limeray Wine-growers Cellar), and renamed in 1995. Customer sales are managed by the ''Caveau des vignerons d'Amboise''<ref>[http://caveauvins-amboise.monsite.wanadoo.fr/ Caveau des vins d'Amboise]</ref> (Amboise Wine-growers Vault), located immediately below the [[Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise]], as well as by various shops in Amboise and the surrounding towns.\n\nWine fairs are organized on a regular basis at Easter and in the week of 15 August (the Feast of the Assumption is a public holiday in France), and are held in a tunnel dug out of the tuffeau rock beneath the Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise.\n\nThe first or second Sunday of July is reserved for a gourmet walk of about 5&nbsp;km around the vineyards of the village of Limeray. The walk is in aid of humanitarian causes and is organized with the help of the [[Lions Clubs International|Lions Club of Amboise les Deux Vall\u00e9es]]. This gives the [[winemaker|wine-growers]], in conjunction with the Commanderie des Grans Vins d'Amboise (the Order of the Great Wines of Amboise) and the region's gastronomical guilds, an opportunity to showcase local wines and other specialities from the Touraine region.<ref>[http://monsite.wanadoo.fr/LIONS_CLUB_AMBOISE/page8.html Renseignements sur la promenade gourmande de Limeray :]</ref>\n\n==The Order of the Great Wines of Amboise==\n[[File:Confr\u00e9rie Saint-Etienne.jpg|thumb|The Order of the Great Wines of Amboise being welcomed at a reception given by Alsace's Saint-Etienne Guild.]]\nLa Commanderie des Grands Vins d'Amboise (the Order of the Great Wines of Amboise) is a guild for the promotion of fine wines founded on 15 April 1967 by a team of wine-growers who were backed by [[Michel Debr\u00e9]], honorary president of the Syndicat des Vins de Touraine Amboise (Touraine-Amboise wine-growers' union).\n\nThe Order derives its name from an order of the Hospitaller Knights of St John of Jerusalem,<ref group=\"N\">Elle avait pour nom exact \u00ab Commanderie de Saint-Jean de l'Isle-l\u00e8s-Amboise \u00bb</ref> who were based on the Ile d'Or<ref group=\"N\">Anciennement appel\u00e9e \u00eele saint-Jean du fait de la pr\u00e9sence de cette commanderie</ref> (Island of Gold), at the foot of the [[Ch\u00e2teau of Amboise]], during the [[Middle Ages]]. The Order has as its motto \"Nos Roys l'ont aym\u00e9\" (mediaeval French for \"Our kings loved it\"), a reference to [[Louis XI|Louis XI's]] [[charter]] decreeing that Amboise wine should be sold before all other kinds at the market in [[Tours]].  The order's purpose is to promote wines from the Touraine-Amboise appellation area in Europe and throughout the world.\n\nUnder the terms of a ministerial order issued on 11 August 2003 [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf//jopdf/2003/143/JO200314360ALL.pdf], the Order is one of ten French guilds for the promotion of fine wines that are authorized to confer competition prize-winning honours, in this case \"Bacchus d'Or\" (Golden Bacchus), on still wines.\n\nTraditionally the Order holds two chapter meetings each year:\n* The rotating chapter in honour of [[Vincent of Saragossa|St Vincent]], patron saint of wine-growers, which moves between each of the ten communes of the appellation in turn.  At this chapter meeting the most long-standing and most well-deserving wine-growers in the village are honoured.\n* The harvest chapter meeting, held in the Croix-Douillard wine cellars in Amboise, at which wine-growers can be enthroned at their own request.\n\n==Touraine-Amboise wines in French literature==\n[[File:Vendange 1900.png|thumb|Harvesting in M\u00e9lie's time]]\nThe writer of regional literature, Robert Morin (1893\u20131925) was the author of ''M\u00e9lie Butteli\u00e8re'' (M\u00e9lie the Basket Carrier), which was published posthumously in 1926. In the 1920s Morin lived in the M\u00e9nard manor house at [[Poc\u00e9-sur-Cisse]]. His heroine, M\u00e9lie, lived half way up a hillside in a cave-dwelling between the hamlets of Fourchette and Monc\u00e9 in [[Limeray]], right in the heart of the present AOC wine-growing area. Her job was to carry the soil washed down the hillsides by the rain back up the slopes again, earthing up the base of each vine.

Ali was so trustworthy that Muhammad asked him to carry the messages and declare the orders. In 630, Ali recited to a large gathering of pilgrims in Mecca [[At-Tawba|a portion of the Quran]] that declared Muhammad and the Islamic community no longer bound by agreements made earlier with Arab [[polytheist]]s. During the [[Conquest of Mecca]] in 630, Muhammad asked Ali to guarantee that the conquest would be bloodless. He ordered Ali to break all the idols worshiped by the [[Banu Aus]], [[Banu Khazraj]], [[Tayy]], and those in the Ka'bah to purify it after its defilement by the polytheism of [[Jahiliyah|old times]].

Sunnis assert that even though Muhammad never appointed a successor, Abu Bakr was elected first caliph by the Muslim community. The Sunnis recognize the first four caliphs as [[Rashidun|Muhammad's rightful successors]]. Shias believe that Muhammad explicitly named Ali as his successor at Ghadir Khumm and Muslim leadership belonged to him by dint of divine order.<ref name=\"Islam\"/>\n\nAccording to [[Wilferd Madelung]], Ali himself was firmly convinced of his legitimacy for the [[caliphate]] based on his close kinship with Muhammad, his knowledge of Islam, and his merits in serving its cause. He told Abu Bakr that his delay in pledging allegiance (''[[bay'ah]]'') to him was based on his belief in his own claim to the caliphate. Ali did not change his mind when he finally pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and to Uthman but had done so for the sake of the unity of Islam, at a time when it was clear that the Muslims had turned away from him.<ref name=\"Islam\"/><ref>See:\n* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=141 and 270}}\n* {{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=99 and 100}}\n</ref> Ali also believed that he could fulfill the role of Imam without fighting.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chirri|1982|p=}}</ref>\n \nAt the beginning of Abu Bakr's caliphate, there was a controversy about Muhammad's endowment to his daughter, especially the oasis of [[Fadak]], between Fatimah and Ali on one side and Abu Bakr on the other side. Fatimah asked Abu Bakr to turn over their property, the lands of Fadak and [[Khaybar]], but Abu Bakr refused and told her that [[Prophets of Islam|prophets]] did not have any legacy and that Fadak belonged to the Muslim community. Abu Bakr said to her, \"Allah's Apostle said, we do not have heirs, whatever we leave is [[Sadaqa]].\" Together with [[Umm Ayman]], Ali testified to the fact that Muhammad granted it to Fatimah Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested her to summon witnesses for her claim. Fatimah became angry and stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude until she died.<ref>See:\n* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=50 and 51}}\n* {{Harvnb|Qazwini|Ordoni|1992|p=211}}\n* {{cite quran|27|16}}\n* {{cite quran|21|89}}\n* {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|4|53|325}}\n* {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|546}}\n* {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|57|60}}\n* {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|19|4352}}</ref> According to some sources, 'Ali did not give his oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr until some time after the death of his wife, Fatimah, in the year 633.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/>\n\nHe pledged allegiance to the second caliph, '[[Umar ibn Khattab]], and helped him as a trusted advisor. 'Umar particularly relied upon Ali as the chief judge of Medina. He also advised Umar to set Hijra as the beginning of the [[Islamic calendar]]. 'Umar followed 'Ali's suggestions in political matters as well as religious ones.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|pp=107\u2013110}}</ref>\n\n'Ali was one of [[The election of Uthman|the electoral council to choose the third caliph]] which was appointed by 'Umar. Although 'Ali was one of the two major candidates, the council was inclined against him. [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas]] and [[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]], who were cousins, were naturally inclined to support Uthman, who was Abdur Rahman's brother-in-law. In addition, Umar gave the deciding vote to Abdur Rahman, who offered the caliphate to Ali on the condition that he should rule in accordance with the Quran, the [[Sunnah|example set by Muhammad]], and the precedents established by the first two caliphs. Ali rejected the third condition while Uthman accepted it. According to [[Comments on the Peak of Eloquence (Ibn Abi al-Hadid)|Ibn Abi al-Hadid's Comments on the Peak of Eloquence]] Ali insisted on his prominence there, but most of the electors supported Uthman and Ali was reluctantly urged to accept him.<ref>See:\n* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=70\u201372}}\n* {{Harvnb|Dakake|2008|p=41}}\n* {{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=21}}\n</ref>\n\n'Uthman ibn 'Affan expressed generosity toward his kin, [[Banu Abd-Shams]], who seemed to dominate him, and his supposed arrogant mistreatment toward several of the earliest companions such as [[Abu Dharr al-Ghifari]], [[Abd-Allah ibn Mas'ud]] and [[Ammar ibn Yasir]] provoked outrage among some groups of people.

On several occasions Ali disagreed with Uthman in the application of the [[Hudud]]; he had publicly shown sympathy for Abu Dharr al-Ghifari and had spoken strongly in the defence of Ammar ibn Yasir. He conveyed to Uthman the criticisms of other Companions and acted on Uthman's behalf as negotiator with the provincial opposition who had come to Medina; because of this some mistrust between Ali and Uthman's family seems to have arisen. Finally, he tried to mitigate the severity of [[Siege of Uthman|the siege]] by his insistence that Uthman should be allowed water.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/>\n\nThere is controversy among historians about the relationship between Ali and Uthman. Although pledging allegiance to Uthman, Ali disagreed with some of his policies. In particular, he clashed with Uthman on the question of religious law. He insisted that [[Hudud|religious punishment]] had to be meted out in several cases, such as those of [[Ubayd Allah ibn Umar]] and [[Walid ibn Uqba]]. In 650, during the [[Hajj|pilgrimage]], he reproached Uthman for his change of the prayer ritual. When Uthman declared that he would take whatever he needed from the fey', Ali exclaimed that in that case the caliph would be prevented by force. Ali endeavoured to protect companions such as [[Ibn Mas'ud]] from maltreatment by the caliph.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=109 and 110}}</ref> Therefore, some historians consider Ali one of the leading members of Uthman's opposition, if not the main one. But [[Wilferd Madelung]] rejects their judgment due to the fact that Ali did not have the Quraysh's support to be elected as a caliph. According to him, there is not even evidence that Ali had close relations with rebels who supported his caliphate, much less directed their actions.\n<ref>See:\n* {{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1970|p=67 and 68}}\n* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=107 and 111}}\n</ref> Some other sources say Ali had acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/> However, Madelung relates that [[Marwan I|Marwan]] told [[Zayn al-Abidin]], the grandson of Ali, that \"No one [among the Islamic nobility] was more temperate toward our master than your master.\"<ref name=\"Madelung 1997 334\">{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=334}}</ref>\n\n==Caliphate==\n{{caliphate}}\n{{See also|Rashidun Empire|Ali as caliph}}\n[[File:First Fitna Map, Ali-Muawiya Phase.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of the [[First Fitna]].

Since the conflicts in which Ali was involved were perpetuated in polemical sectarian historiography, biographical material is often biased. However, the sources agree that he was a profoundly religious man, devoted to the cause of Islam and the rule of justice in accordance with the Quran and the [[Sunnah]]. The sources abound in notices on his austerity, rigorous observance of religious duties, and detachment from worldly goods. Authors have noted that Ali stood firmly by his principles and would not compromise them for political self-gain.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Madelung |first1=Wilferd |title=The Succession to Muhammad |date=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=149 |quote='Ali, deeply convinced of his right and his religious mission, unwilling to compromise his principles for the sake of political expediency, ready to fight against overwhelming odds.}}</ref>\n\n===Election===\nUthman's assassination meant that rebels had to select a new caliph. This met with difficulties since the rebels were divided into several groups: the ''[[Muhajirun]]'', ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'', [[Egypt]]ians, Kufans and [[Bassorah|Basrites]]. There were three candidates: Ali, [[Talha]]h and [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam|Al-Zubayr]]. First the rebels approached Ali and offered him the caliphate. Some of Muhammad's companions tried to persuade Ali to accept the office,<ref name=\"Sermon 3\">\n* [[Nahj Al-Balagha]] [http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=3 Nahj Al-Balagha Sermon 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923213833/http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=3 |date=23 September 2009 }}\n* For Isnad of this sermon and the names of scholars who narrate it see [https://books.google.com/books?id=zQjKHj0vA1IC&pg=PA112&dq=Ali+axis++hand-mill&ei=GEPmR5jmDZG0yQSY9InCAg&sig=LitcBMh39oXValrXDMsMwnFTXKA#PPA108,M1 Nahjul Balagha, Mohammad Askari Jafery (1984), pp. 108\u2013112]</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=119}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=141\u2013143}}</ref> but he turned down the offer, requesting he be made a counsellor instead of a chief.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hamidullah|1988|p=126}}</ref>\nTalhah, Zubayr and other companions also refused the rebels' offer as well. Therefore, the rebels warned the inhabitants of Medina to select a caliph within one day, or they would take drastic action. In order to resolve the deadlock, the Muslims gathered in the [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi|Prophet's Mosque]] on 18 June 656, to appoint the caliph. Initially, 'Ali refused to accept the office, simply because his most vigorous supporters were rebels. However, when some notable companions of Muhammad, in addition to the residents of Medina, urged him to accept the offer, he finally agreed. According to [[Abu Mekhnaf]]'s narration, Talhah was the first prominent companion who gave his pledge to 'Ali, but other accounts claimed otherwise, stating they were forced to give their pledge. Also, Talhah and Al-Zubayr later claimed they supported him only reluctantly. Regardless, Ali refuted these claims, insisting they recognised him as caliph voluntarily. [[Wilferd Madelung]] believes that coercion was not a factor and that they pledged publicly in the mosque.<ref name=\"Ashraf (2005), pp. 119-120\">{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=119 and 120}}</ref><ref name=\"Madelung (1997), pp. 141-145\">{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=141\u2013145}}</ref> While the overwhelming majority of Medina's population as well as many of the rebels gave their pledge, some important figures or tribes did not do so. The Umayyads, kinsmen of Uthman, fled to the [[Levant]], or remained in their houses, later refusing 'Ali's legitimacy. [[Sa'ad ibn Abi Waqqas]] was absent and [[Abdullah ibn Umar|'Abdullah ibn 'Umar]] abstained from offering his allegiance, but both of them assured 'Ali that they would not act against him.<ref name=\"Ashraf (2005), pp. 119-120\"/><ref name=\"Madelung (1997), pp. 141-145\"/> Ali thus inherited the Rashidun caliphate \u2013 which extended from Egypt in the west to the [[Iranian Plateau|Iranian highlands]] in the east\u2014while the situation in the [[Hejaz]] and the other provinces on the eve of his election was unsettled.\n\nUthman had appointed his family members as governors and in other positions of power, and public dissatisfaction with this nepotism was one of the factors that had caused a rebellion against him.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Madelung |first1=Wilferd |title=The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate |date=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=87}}</ref> In addition, Uthman's governors were widely known for their corruption and plundering.

Some Muslims, known as Uthmanis, considered Uthman a rightful and just [[caliph]] till the end, who had been unlawfully killed. Some others, known as the party of Ali, believed Uthman had fallen into error, had forfeited the caliphate, and been lawfully executed for his refusal to mend his ways or step down; thus, Ali was the just and true Imam and his opponents were infidels. This was not the position of Ali himself. This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community regarding who had the legitimate right to occupy the caliphate.<ref>See:\n* {{Harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=47}}\n* {{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1970|p=72}}\n* {{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|p=57}}</ref>\nThe First Fitna, 656\u2013661, followed the assassination of [[Uthman]], continued during the caliphate of Ali, and was ended by Muawiyah's assumption of the caliphate.

Later, Muawiyah I, governor of the Levant and cousin of [[Uthman]], refused Ali's demands for allegiance. Ali opened negotiations, but Muawiyah insisted on Levantine autonomy under his rule. Muawiyah mobilised an army and refused to pay homage to Ali on the pretext that his contingent had not participated in the election. Ali then moved his armies north and the two sides encamped at [[Siffin]] for more than one hundred days, most of the time being spent in negotiations. Although Ali exchanged several letters with Muawiyah, he was unable to dismiss the latter, nor persuade him to pledge allegiance. Skirmishes between the parties led to the [[Battle of Siffin]] in 657.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/><ref name=\"lapidus47\">See:\n* {{Harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=47}}\n* {{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1970|pp=70\u201372}}\n* {{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|p=53 and 54}}</ref>\n\nA week of combat was followed by a violent battle known as ''laylat al-harir'' (the night of clamour). Muawiyah's army was on the point of being routed when [[Amr ibn al-As]] advised Muawiyah to have his soldiers hoist ''[[mus'haf]]'' (either parchments inscribed with verses of the Quran, or complete copies of it) on their spearheads in order to cause disagreement and confusion in Ali's army.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/><ref name=\"lapidus47\"/> Ali saw through the stratagem, but only a minority wanted to pursue the fight.<ref name=\"Islam\"/>\nThe two armies finally agreed to settle the matter of who should be caliph by arbitration. The refusal of the largest bloc in Ali's army to fight was the decisive factor in his acceptance of the arbitration. The question as to whether the arbiter would represent Ali or the Kufans caused a further split in Ali's army. [[Ash'ath ibn Qays]] and some others rejected Ali's nominees, [['Abd Allah ibn 'Abbas]] and [[Malik al-Ashtar]], and insisted on [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]], for his neutrality. Finally, Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa. [[Amr ibn al-As]] was appointed by Muawiyah as an arbitrator. Seven months after the battle, in February 658, the two arbitrators met at [[Udhruh|Adhruh]] about 10 miles northwest of Maan in Jordan. [[Amr ibn al-As]] convinced [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]] that both Ali and Muawiyah should step down and a new caliph be elected. Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision, which had lowered the caliph to the status of the rebellious Muawiyah. Ali was therefore outwitted by Muawiyah and [[Amr ibn al-As]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia |first=Alexander |last=Mikaberidze|authorlink=Alexander Mikaberidze|page= 836 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jBBYD2J2oE4C&pg=PA836&dq=Muawiyah+ali+at+Siffin#v=onepage|isbn=9781598843378 |date=22 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L_xxOM85bD8C&pg=PA602&dq=Muawiyah+ali+at+Siffin#v=onepage|title=Ground Warfare|publisher=|isbn=9781576073445|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley|year=2002}}</ref>\nWhen the arbitrators assembled at [[Daumet-ul-Jandal]], a series of daily meetings were arranged for them to discuss the matters in hand.

Ali opposed the centralisation of capital control over provincial revenues, favouring an equal distribution of [[Islamic tax|taxes]] and booty amongst the Muslim citizens; he distributed the entire revenue of the [[Bayt al-mal|treasury]] among them. 'Ali refrained from [[nepotism]], including with his brother '[[Aqeel ibn Abu Talib]].

His policy of equal distribution of taxes and booty gained the support of Muhammad's companions, especially the Ansar who were subordinated by the Quraysh leadership after Muhammad, the traditional tribal leaders, and the [[Qari|Qurra]] or Qur'anic reciters that sought pious Islamic leadership.

Although at this time there were many who were counted as political Shia, few of them believed in Ali's religious leadership.<ref>{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=63}}</ref>\n\n====Governance doctrine====\n{{See also|Letter of Ali ibn Abi Talib to Malik al-Ashtar}}\nHis policies and ideas of governing are manifested in the letter he sent to [[Malik al-Ashtar]] after appointing him governor of Egypt.

According to the Shia, Ali himself gave this testimony:\n<blockquote>Not a single [[Ayah|verse]] of the Quran [[Wahy|descended]] upon (was revealed to) the Messenger of God which he did not proceed to dictate to me and make me [[Qira'at|recite]]. I would [[Mushaf|write it with my own hand]], and he would instruct me as to its ''tafsir'' (the literal explanation) and the ''[[ta'wil]]'' (the spiritual exegesis), the ''[[Naskh (tafsir)|nasikh]]'' (the verse which abrogates) and the ''[[mansukh]]'' (the abrogated verse), the ''[[Muhkam (tafsir)|muhkam]]'' and the ''[[mutashabih]]'' (the fixed and the ambiguous), the particular and the general&nbsp;...<ref>{{Harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=46}}\n</ref></blockquote>It has been narrated that when [[Abbas ibn Ali|Abbas]] was a baby, Ali placed him on his lap, kissed his hands and began to weep. He foretold the tragedy of Abbas and the inevitable fate of his hands which caused his wife, [[Umm ul-Banin]], to also weep. However, he goes on to describe Abbas's future position and great status with God, and this relieves her.<ref name=\"Al Abbas\" />\n\n===Theosophy===\nAccording to [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], Ali is credited with having established [[Kalam|Islamic theology]], and his quotations contain the first rational proofs among Muslims of the [[Tawhid|Unity of God]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Nasr|2006|p=120}}</ref> [[Ibn Abi al-Hadid]] has quoted\n<blockquote>As for theosophy and dealing with matters of divinity, it was not an Arab art.

The first one among Arabs to deal with it was Ali.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1996|p=136}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn later [[Islamic philosophy]], especially in the teachings of [[Mulla Sadra]] and his followers, like Allameh Tabatabaei, Ali's sayings and sermons were increasingly regarded as central sources of metaphysical knowledge, or divine philosophy. Members of [[Transcendent Theosophy|Sadra's school]] regard Ali as the supreme [[metaphysician]] of Islam.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> According to Henry Corbin, the ''[[Nahj al-Balagha]]'' may be regarded as one of the most important sources of doctrines professed by Shia thinkers, especially after 1500. Its influence can be sensed in the logical co-ordination of terms, the deduction of correct conclusions, and the creation of certain technical terms in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] which entered the literary and [[Philosophy|philosophical language]] independently of the translation into Arabic of [[Greek language|Greek]] texts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=35}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, some hidden or occult sciences such as ''[[Al-Jafr (book)|jafr]]'', Islamic [[numerology]], and the science of the symbolic significance of the letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]], are said to have been established by Ali<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> through his having studied the texts of [[Al-Jafr (book)|al-Jafr]] and [[al-Jamia]].\n\n===Eloquence===\nAli was also a great scholar of [[Arabic literature]] and pioneered in the field of Arabic grammar and rhetoric. Numerous short sayings of Ali have become part of general Islamic culture and are quoted as aphorisms and proverbs in daily life. They have also become the basis of literary works or have been integrated into poetic verse in many languages. Already in the 8th century, literary authorities such as [['Abd al-Hamid ibn Yahya al-'Amiri]] pointed to the unparalleled eloquence of Ali's sermons and sayings, as did [[al-Jahiz]] in the following century.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Even staffs in the [[Divan]] of Umayyad recited Ali's sermons to improve their eloquence.<ref>\"\u062d\u0641\u0638\u062a \u0633\u0628\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u062e\u0637\u0628\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0637\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0639 \u0641\u0641\u0627\u0636\u062a \u062b\u0645 \u0641\u0627\u0636\u062a ) \u0648\u064a\u0639\u0646\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0639 \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \" [http://books.rafed.net/turathona/5/ts2.html \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0645\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0646\u0647\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0629] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617233159/http://books.rafed.net/turathona/5/ts2.html |date=17 June 2015 }}</ref> The most famous selection of Ali's utterances and writings has been gathered in a book called ''[[Nahj al-Balagha]]'' (''Peak of Eloquence'') by a 10th-century Shia scholar, [[Al-Sharif al-Radi]], who selected them for their singular rhetorical beauty.<ref>[http://www.islamology.com/Resources/Nahj_Imam/Sermons/bookE/sources.htm Sources of Nahj Al-Balagha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123072458/http://www.islamology.com/Resources/Nahj_Imam/Sermons/bookE/sources.htm |date=23 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\n====The sermons without dots and alephs====\nOf note among sermons quoted in the book is the undotted sermon as well as the sermon without [[Aleph]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=|title=Sermons without 'dot's and 'Alef'|url=https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1396/01/16/1370272/%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B7%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D9%85%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B9?ref=shahrekhabar|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=fa|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406202149/https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1396/01/16/1370272/%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B7%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D9%85%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B9?ref=shahrekhabar|archivedate=6 April 2017}}</ref> According to narrations, some companions of [[Muhammad]] had gathered somewhere discussing the role of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] in speaking.

The extensive [[secondary source]]s include, in addition to works by Sunni and Shia Muslims, writings by [[Christian Arabs]], [[Hindus]], and other non-Muslims from the Middle East and Asia and a few works by modern western scholars. However, many of the early Islamic sources are coloured to some extent by a positive or negative bias towards Ali.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThere had been a common tendency among the earlier western scholars to consider narrations and reports gathered in later periods as fabrications, due to their tendency towards later Sunni and Shia partisan positions. This led these scholars to regard certain reported events as inauthentic or irrelevant. For example, [[Leone Caetani]] considered the attribution of historical reports to [['Abd Allah ibn 'Abbas|Ibn Abbas]] and Aisha as mostly fictitious while proffering accounts reported without ''[[isnad]]'' by the early compilers of history like Ibn Ishaq. Wilferd Madelung has rejected the stance of indiscriminately dismissing everything not included in \"early sources\" and in this approach tendentiousness alone is no evidence for late origin. According to him, Caetani's approach is inconsistent. Madelung and some later historians do not reject the narrations which have been compiled in later periods and try to judge them in the context of history and on the basis of their compatibility with the events and figures.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=xi, 19 and 20}}</ref>\n\nUntil the rise of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], few books were written and most of the reports had been oral. The most notable work prior to this period is ''[[The Book of Sulaym ibn Qays]]'', written by [[Sulaym ibn Qays]], a companion of Ali who lived before the Abbasids.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lawson|2005|p=59}}</ref> When paper was introduced to Muslim society, numerous monographs were written between 750 and 950. According to Robinson, at least twenty-one separate monographs have been composed on the Battle of Siffin. [[Abi Mikhnaf]] is one of the most renowned writers of this period who tried to gather all of the reports. Ninth- and tenth-century historians collected, selected and arranged the available narrations. However, most of these monographs do not exist any more except for a few which have been used in later works such as [[History of the Prophets and Kings]] by [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] (d.923).<ref>{{Harvnb|Robinson|2003|p=28 and 34}}</ref>\n\nShia of Iraq actively participated in writing monographs but most of those works have been lost. On the other hand, in the 8th and 9th century Ali's descendants such as [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] and [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] narrated his quotations and reports which have been gathered in Shia hadith books. The later Shia works written after the 10th century are about biographies of [[The Fourteen Infallibles]] and [[Twelve Imams]]. The earliest surviving work and one of the most important works in this field is ''[[Kitab al-Irshad]]'' by [[Shaykh Mufid]] (d. 1022). The author has dedicated the first part of his book to a detailed account of Ali. There are also some books known as ''Man\u0101qib'' which describe Ali's character from a religious viewpoint. Such works also constitute a kind of historiography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/message-thaqalayn/general-message-thaqalayn/glance-historiography-shiite-culture-rasul-jafariyan|title=A Glance at Historiography in Shiite Culture|work=Al-Islam.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Islam|Shia Islam}}\n* [[Outline of Islam]]\n* [[Glossary of Islam]]\n* [[Index of Islam-related articles]]\n\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n* [[Alevism]]\n* [[Ali in Muslim culture]]\n* [[Al-Farooq (title)]]\n* [[Hashemites]] Royal Family of Jordan\n* [[Idris I]] The First King of Morocco Founded 788\n* [[List of expeditions of Muhammad|List of expeditions of Ali during Muhammad's era]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist|2}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Al-Islam\">{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/articles/life-commander-faithful-ali-ibn-abu-talib|last=Al-Islam|title=The Life of the Commander of the Faithful Ali Ibn Abu Talib (as)|accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Iranica\">{{cite encyclopedia|title = Al\u012b ibn Abu Talib|encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica|accessdate = 16 December 2010|url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ali-b-abi-taleb|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429163734/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ali-b-abi-taleb|archivedate = 29 April 2011|url-status=live|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Nasr |first=Seyyed Hossein |authorlink=Seyyed Hossein Nasr |title=Ali |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |accessdate=12 October 2007 |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9005712/Ali |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018014146/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9005712/Ali |archivedate=18 October 2007 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite book| last = Ahmed| first = M.

Hence the Shia say of Ali that his face is honoured, as it was never sullied by prostrations before idols.<ref name=\"Tabatabae191\"/> The Sunnis also use the honorific ''Karam Allahu Wajhahu'', which means \"God's Favour upon his Face.\" The reason his acceptance is often not called a conversion is because he was never an idol worshipper like the people of Mecca.

He told Abu Bakr that his delay in pledging allegiance (''[[bay'ah]]'') to him was based on his belief in his own claim to the caliphate. Ali did not change his mind when he finally pledged allegiance to Abu Bakr and then to Umar and to Uthman but had done so for the sake of the unity of Islam, at a time when it was clear that the Muslims had turned away from him.<ref name=\"Islam\"/><ref>See:\n* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=141 and 270}}\n* {{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=99 and 100}}\n</ref> Ali also believed that he could fulfill the role of Imam without fighting.<ref>{{Harvnb|Chirri|1982|p=}}</ref>\n \nAt the beginning of Abu Bakr's caliphate, there was a controversy about Muhammad's endowment to his daughter, especially the oasis of [[Fadak]], between Fatimah and Ali on one side and Abu Bakr on the other side. Fatimah asked Abu Bakr to turn over their property, the lands of Fadak and [[Khaybar]], but Abu Bakr refused and told her that [[Prophets of Islam|prophets]] did not have any legacy and that Fadak belonged to the Muslim community. Abu Bakr said to her, \"Allah's Apostle said, we do not have heirs, whatever we leave is [[Sadaqa]].\" Together with [[Umm Ayman]], Ali testified to the fact that Muhammad granted it to Fatimah Zahra, when Abu Bakr requested her to summon witnesses for her claim. Fatimah became angry and stopped speaking to Abu Bakr, and continued assuming that attitude until she died.<ref>See:\n* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=50 and 51}}\n* {{Harvnb|Qazwini|Ordoni|1992|p=211}}\n* {{cite quran|27|16}}\n* {{cite quran|21|89}}\n* {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|4|53|325}}\n* {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|59|546}}\n* {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes|5|57|60}}\n* {{hadith-usc|usc=yes|muslim|19|4352}}</ref> According to some sources, 'Ali did not give his oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr until some time after the death of his wife, Fatimah, in the year 633.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/>\n\nHe pledged allegiance to the second caliph, '[[Umar ibn Khattab]], and helped him as a trusted advisor. 'Umar particularly relied upon Ali as the chief judge of Medina. He also advised Umar to set Hijra as the beginning of the [[Islamic calendar]]. 'Umar followed 'Ali's suggestions in political matters as well as religious ones.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|pp=107\u2013110}}</ref>\n\n'Ali was one of [[The election of Uthman|the electoral council to choose the third caliph]] which was appointed by 'Umar. Although 'Ali was one of the two major candidates, the council was inclined against him. [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas]] and [[Abdur Rahman bin Awf]], who were cousins, were naturally inclined to support Uthman, who was Abdur Rahman's brother-in-law. In addition, Umar gave the deciding vote to Abdur Rahman, who offered the caliphate to Ali on the condition that he should rule in accordance with the Quran, the [[Sunnah|example set by Muhammad]], and the precedents established by the first two caliphs. Ali rejected the third condition while Uthman accepted it. According to [[Comments on the Peak of Eloquence (Ibn Abi al-Hadid)|Ibn Abi al-Hadid's Comments on the Peak of Eloquence]] Ali insisted on his prominence there, but most of the electors supported Uthman and Ali was reluctantly urged to accept him.<ref>See:\n* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=70\u201372}}\n* {{Harvnb|Dakake|2008|p=41}}\n* {{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=21}}\n</ref>\n\n'Uthman ibn 'Affan expressed generosity toward his kin, [[Banu Abd-Shams]], who seemed to dominate him, and his supposed arrogant mistreatment toward several of the earliest companions such as [[Abu Dharr al-Ghifari]], [[Abd-Allah ibn Mas'ud]] and [[Ammar ibn Yasir]] provoked outrage among some groups of people. Overt resistance arose in 650\u2013651 throughout most of the empire.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=87 and 88}}</ref> The dissatisfaction with his rule and the governments appointed by him was not restricted to the provinces outside [[Arabia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=90}}</ref> When Uthman's kin, especially [[Marwan I|Marwan]], gained control over him, the noble companions, including most of [[The election of Uthman|the members of elector council]], turned against him or at least withdrew their support, putting pressure on the caliph to mend his ways and reduce the influence of his assertive kin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=92\u2013107}}</ref>\n\nAt this time, 'Ali had acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him. On several occasions Ali disagreed with Uthman in the application of the [[Hudud]]; he had publicly shown sympathy for Abu Dharr al-Ghifari and had spoken strongly in the defence of Ammar ibn Yasir. He conveyed to Uthman the criticisms of other Companions and acted on Uthman's behalf as negotiator with the provincial opposition who had come to Medina; because of this some mistrust between Ali and Uthman's family seems to have arisen. Finally, he tried to mitigate the severity of [[Siege of Uthman|the siege]] by his insistence that Uthman should be allowed water.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/>\n\nThere is controversy among historians about the relationship between Ali and Uthman. Although pledging allegiance to Uthman, Ali disagreed with some of his policies. In particular, he clashed with Uthman on the question of religious law. He insisted that [[Hudud|religious punishment]] had to be meted out in several cases, such as those of [[Ubayd Allah ibn Umar]] and [[Walid ibn Uqba]]. In 650, during the [[Hajj|pilgrimage]], he reproached Uthman for his change of the prayer ritual. When Uthman declared that he would take whatever he needed from the fey', Ali exclaimed that in that case the caliph would be prevented by force. Ali endeavoured to protect companions such as [[Ibn Mas'ud]] from maltreatment by the caliph.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=109 and 110}}</ref> Therefore, some historians consider Ali one of the leading members of Uthman's opposition, if not the main one. But [[Wilferd Madelung]] rejects their judgment due to the fact that Ali did not have the Quraysh's support to be elected as a caliph. According to him, there is not even evidence that Ali had close relations with rebels who supported his caliphate, much less directed their actions.\n<ref>See:\n* {{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1970|p=67 and 68}}\n* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=107 and 111}}\n</ref> Some other sources say Ali had acted as a restraining influence on Uthman without directly opposing him.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/> However, Madelung relates that [[Marwan I|Marwan]] told [[Zayn al-Abidin]], the grandson of Ali, that \"No one [among the Islamic nobility] was more temperate toward our master than your master.\"<ref name=\"Madelung 1997 334\">{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=334}}</ref>\n\n==Caliphate==\n{{caliphate}}\n{{See also|Rashidun Empire|Ali as caliph}}\n[[File:First Fitna Map, Ali-Muawiya Phase.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Map of the [[First Fitna]].

Since the conflicts in which Ali was involved were perpetuated in polemical sectarian historiography, biographical material is often biased. However, the sources agree that he was a profoundly religious man, devoted to the cause of Islam and the rule of justice in accordance with the Quran and the [[Sunnah]]. The sources abound in notices on his austerity, rigorous observance of religious duties, and detachment from worldly goods. Authors have noted that Ali stood firmly by his principles and would not compromise them for political self-gain.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Madelung |first1=Wilferd |title=The Succession to Muhammad |date=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=149 |quote='Ali, deeply convinced of his right and his religious mission, unwilling to compromise his principles for the sake of political expediency, ready to fight against overwhelming odds.}}</ref>\n\n===Election===\nUthman's assassination meant that rebels had to select a new caliph. This met with difficulties since the rebels were divided into several groups: the ''[[Muhajirun]]'', ''[[Ansar (Islam)|Ansar]]'', [[Egypt]]ians, Kufans and [[Bassorah|Basrites]]. There were three candidates: Ali, [[Talha]]h and [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam|Al-Zubayr]]. First the rebels approached Ali and offered him the caliphate. Some of Muhammad's companions tried to persuade Ali to accept the office,<ref name=\"Sermon 3\">\n* [[Nahj Al-Balagha]] [http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=3 Nahj Al-Balagha Sermon 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923213833/http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=3 |date=23 September 2009 }}\n* For Isnad of this sermon and the names of scholars who narrate it see [https://books.google.com/books?id=zQjKHj0vA1IC&pg=PA112&dq=Ali+axis++hand-mill&ei=GEPmR5jmDZG0yQSY9InCAg&sig=LitcBMh39oXValrXDMsMwnFTXKA#PPA108,M1 Nahjul Balagha, Mohammad Askari Jafery (1984), pp. 108\u2013112]</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=119}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=141\u2013143}}</ref> but he turned down the offer, requesting he be made a counsellor instead of a chief.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hamidullah|1988|p=126}}</ref>\nTalhah, Zubayr and other companions also refused the rebels' offer as well. Therefore, the rebels warned the inhabitants of Medina to select a caliph within one day, or they would take drastic action. In order to resolve the deadlock, the Muslims gathered in the [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi|Prophet's Mosque]] on 18 June 656, to appoint the caliph. Initially, 'Ali refused to accept the office, simply because his most vigorous supporters were rebels. However, when some notable companions of Muhammad, in addition to the residents of Medina, urged him to accept the offer, he finally agreed. According to [[Abu Mekhnaf]]'s narration, Talhah was the first prominent companion who gave his pledge to 'Ali, but other accounts claimed otherwise, stating they were forced to give their pledge. Also, Talhah and Al-Zubayr later claimed they supported him only reluctantly. Regardless, Ali refuted these claims, insisting they recognised him as caliph voluntarily. [[Wilferd Madelung]] believes that coercion was not a factor and that they pledged publicly in the mosque.<ref name=\"Ashraf (2005), pp. 119-120\">{{Harvnb|Ashraf|2005|p=119 and 120}}</ref><ref name=\"Madelung (1997), pp. 141-145\">{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|pp=141\u2013145}}</ref> While the overwhelming majority of Medina's population as well as many of the rebels gave their pledge, some important figures or tribes did not do so. The Umayyads, kinsmen of Uthman, fled to the [[Levant]], or remained in their houses, later refusing 'Ali's legitimacy. [[Sa'ad ibn Abi Waqqas]] was absent and [[Abdullah ibn Umar|'Abdullah ibn 'Umar]] abstained from offering his allegiance, but both of them assured 'Ali that they would not act against him.<ref name=\"Ashraf (2005), pp. 119-120\"/><ref name=\"Madelung (1997), pp. 141-145\"/> Ali thus inherited the Rashidun caliphate \u2013 which extended from Egypt in the west to the [[Iranian Plateau|Iranian highlands]] in the east\u2014while the situation in the [[Hejaz]] and the other provinces on the eve of his election was unsettled.\n\nUthman had appointed his family members as governors and in other positions of power, and public dissatisfaction with this nepotism was one of the factors that had caused a rebellion against him.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Madelung |first1=Wilferd |title=The Succession to Muhammad: A Study of the Early Caliphate |date=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=87}}</ref> In addition, Uthman's governors were widely known for their corruption and plundering.

Some Muslims, known as Uthmanis, considered Uthman a rightful and just [[caliph]] till the end, who had been unlawfully killed. Some others, known as the party of Ali, believed Uthman had fallen into error, had forfeited the caliphate, and been lawfully executed for his refusal to mend his ways or step down; thus, Ali was the just and true Imam and his opponents were infidels. This was not the position of Ali himself. This civil war created permanent divisions within the Muslim community regarding who had the legitimate right to occupy the caliphate.<ref>See:\n* {{Harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=47}}\n* {{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1970|p=72}}\n* {{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|p=57}}</ref>\nThe First Fitna, 656\u2013661, followed the assassination of [[Uthman]], continued during the caliphate of Ali, and was ended by Muawiyah's assumption of the caliphate.

Later, Muawiyah I, governor of the Levant and cousin of [[Uthman]], refused Ali's demands for allegiance. Ali opened negotiations, but Muawiyah insisted on Levantine autonomy under his rule. Muawiyah mobilised an army and refused to pay homage to Ali on the pretext that his contingent had not participated in the election. Ali then moved his armies north and the two sides encamped at [[Siffin]] for more than one hundred days, most of the time being spent in negotiations. Although Ali exchanged several letters with Muawiyah, he was unable to dismiss the latter, nor persuade him to pledge allegiance. Skirmishes between the parties led to the [[Battle of Siffin]] in 657.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/><ref name=\"lapidus47\">See:\n* {{Harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=47}}\n* {{Harvnb|Holt|Lambton|Lewis|1970|pp=70\u201372}}\n* {{Harvnb|Tabatabaei|1979|p=53 and 54}}</ref>\n\nA week of combat was followed by a violent battle known as ''laylat al-harir'' (the night of clamour). Muawiyah's army was on the point of being routed when [[Amr ibn al-As]] advised Muawiyah to have his soldiers hoist ''[[mus'haf]]'' (either parchments inscribed with verses of the Quran, or complete copies of it) on their spearheads in order to cause disagreement and confusion in Ali's army.<ref name=\"Iranica\"/><ref name=\"lapidus47\"/> Ali saw through the stratagem, but only a minority wanted to pursue the fight.<ref name=\"Islam\"/>\nThe two armies finally agreed to settle the matter of who should be caliph by arbitration. The refusal of the largest bloc in Ali's army to fight was the decisive factor in his acceptance of the arbitration. The question as to whether the arbiter would represent Ali or the Kufans caused a further split in Ali's army. [[Ash'ath ibn Qays]] and some others rejected Ali's nominees, [['Abd Allah ibn 'Abbas]] and [[Malik al-Ashtar]], and insisted on [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]], for his neutrality. Finally, Ali was urged to accept Abu Musa. [[Amr ibn al-As]] was appointed by Muawiyah as an arbitrator. Seven months after the battle, in February 658, the two arbitrators met at [[Udhruh|Adhruh]] about 10 miles northwest of Maan in Jordan. [[Amr ibn al-As]] convinced [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]] that both Ali and Muawiyah should step down and a new caliph be elected. Ali and his supporters were stunned by the decision, which had lowered the caliph to the status of the rebellious Muawiyah. Ali was therefore outwitted by Muawiyah and [[Amr ibn al-As]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Conflict and Conquest in the Islamic World: A Historical Encyclopedia |first=Alexander |last=Mikaberidze|authorlink=Alexander Mikaberidze|page= 836 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=jBBYD2J2oE4C&pg=PA836&dq=Muawiyah+ali+at+Siffin#v=onepage|isbn=9781598843378 |date=22 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=L_xxOM85bD8C&pg=PA602&dq=Muawiyah+ali+at+Siffin#v=onepage|title=Ground Warfare|publisher=|isbn=9781576073445|last1=Sandler|first1=Stanley|year=2002}}</ref>\nWhen the arbitrators assembled at [[Daumet-ul-Jandal]], a series of daily meetings were arranged for them to discuss the matters in hand.

Shias argue that his determination in pushing these reforms aroused the ire of the wealthy and the privileged former companions of the Prophet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/imam-ali-s-book-government-ayatullah-muhammadi-rayshahri/politics-two-schools#alawi-politics|title=Politics in two Schools|website=Al-Islam.org|language=en|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=10495|title=Hazrat Ali (A.S.): His Poor Subjects and Pro-Poor Government {{!}}{{!}} Imam Reza (A.S.)

The common men, the poor, apparently less important sections of your subjects are the pillars of Islam\u2026.be more friendly with them and secure their confidence and sympathy.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>\n'Ali recovered the land granted by 'Uthman and swore to recover anything that elites had acquired before his election. Ali opposed the centralisation of capital control over provincial revenues, favouring an equal distribution of [[Islamic tax|taxes]] and booty amongst the Muslim citizens; he distributed the entire revenue of the [[Bayt al-mal|treasury]] among them. 'Ali refrained from [[nepotism]], including with his brother '[[Aqeel ibn Abu Talib]]. This reflected his policy of offering equality to Muslims who served Islam in its early years and to those Muslims who played a role in the later [[Muslim conquests|conquests]].<ref name=\"Iranica\" /><ref>See:\n* {{Harvnb|Lapidus|2002|p=46}}\n* {{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=150 and 264}}\n</ref>\n\n====Forming coalitions====\nAli succeeded in forming a broad coalition, especially after the [[Battle of the Camel]]. His policy of equal distribution of taxes and booty gained the support of Muhammad's companions, especially the Ansar who were subordinated by the Quraysh leadership after Muhammad, the traditional tribal leaders, and the [[Qari|Qurra]] or Qur'anic reciters that sought pious Islamic leadership. The successful formation of this diverse coalition seems to be due to Ali's charisma.<ref name=\"Iranica\" /><ref>{{Harvnb|Shaban|1971|p=72}}</ref> This diverse coalition became known as ''Shia Ali'', \"adherents of Ali\" or \"followers of Ali\". However, according to Shia, as well as non-Shia reports, the majority of those who supported 'Ali after his election as caliph were Shia politically, not religiously. Although at this time there were many who were counted as political Shia, few of them believed in Ali's religious leadership.<ref>{{Harvnb|Momen|1985|p=63}}</ref>\n\n====Governance doctrine====\n{{See also|Letter of Ali ibn Abi Talib to Malik al-Ashtar}}\nHis policies and ideas of governing are manifested in the letter he sent to [[Malik al-Ashtar]] after appointing him governor of Egypt. This instruction, which has historically been viewed as the ideal constitution for Islamic governance, alongside the [[Constitution of Medina]], involved detailed descriptions of the duties and rights of the ruler, the various functionaries of the state, and the main classes of society at that time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Shah-Kazemi|2007|p=81}}</ref><ref>United Nations Development Program, Arab human development report, (2002), p. 107</ref>\nAli wrote:\n\n{{quote|text=Infuse your heart with mercy, love and kindness for your subjects. Be not in face of them a voracious animal, counting them as easy prey, for they are of two kinds: either they are your brothers in faith or in creation. Error catches them unaware, deficiencies overcome them, (evil deeds) are committed by them intentionally and by mistake. So grant them your pardon and your forgiveness to the same extent that you hope God will grant you His pardon and His forgiveness. For you are above them, and he who appointed you is above you, and God is above him who appointed you. God has sought from you the fulfillment of their requirements and He is trying you with them.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1989|p=75}}</ref>}}\n\nSince the majority of 'Ali's subjects were nomads and peasants, he was concerned with agriculture. He instructed Malik to give more attention to land development than to the tax collection, because tax can only be obtained by the development of the land and whoever demands tax without developing the land ruins the country and destroys the people.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lambton|1991|p=xix and xx}}</ref>\n\n===Assassination in Kufa===\n{{main|Assassination of Ali}}\n[[File:Kufa Mosque 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Mosque of Kufa|Great Mosque]] of [[Kufa]], where Ali was fatally attacked]]\n\nOn 19 Ramadan AH 40, which would correspond to 26 January 661,<ref name=\"Brill-ali\">{{Cite encyclopedia |title=\u02bfAl\u012b b.

Finally, Hasan was forced to make peace and yield the caliphate to Muawiyah. Muawiyah then transformed tuned the caliphate into a secular kingdom ([[Sultanate]]).

According to the Shia, Ali himself gave this testimony:\n<blockquote>Not a single [[Ayah|verse]] of the Quran [[Wahy|descended]] upon (was revealed to) the Messenger of God which he did not proceed to dictate to me and make me [[Qira'at|recite]]. I would [[Mushaf|write it with my own hand]], and he would instruct me as to its ''tafsir'' (the literal explanation) and the ''[[ta'wil]]'' (the spiritual exegesis), the ''[[Naskh (tafsir)|nasikh]]'' (the verse which abrogates) and the ''[[mansukh]]'' (the abrogated verse), the ''[[Muhkam (tafsir)|muhkam]]'' and the ''[[mutashabih]]'' (the fixed and the ambiguous), the particular and the general&nbsp;...<ref>{{Harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=46}}\n</ref></blockquote>It has been narrated that when [[Abbas ibn Ali|Abbas]] was a baby, Ali placed him on his lap, kissed his hands and began to weep. He foretold the tragedy of Abbas and the inevitable fate of his hands which caused his wife, [[Umm ul-Banin]], to also weep. However, he goes on to describe Abbas's future position and great status with God, and this relieves her.<ref name=\"Al Abbas\" />\n\n===Theosophy===\nAccording to [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], Ali is credited with having established [[Kalam|Islamic theology]], and his quotations contain the first rational proofs among Muslims of the [[Tawhid|Unity of God]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Nasr|2006|p=120}}</ref> [[Ibn Abi al-Hadid]] has quoted\n<blockquote>As for theosophy and dealing with matters of divinity, it was not an Arab art.

The first one among Arabs to deal with it was Ali.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1996|p=136}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn later [[Islamic philosophy]], especially in the teachings of [[Mulla Sadra]] and his followers, like Allameh Tabatabaei, Ali's sayings and sermons were increasingly regarded as central sources of metaphysical knowledge, or divine philosophy. Members of [[Transcendent Theosophy|Sadra's school]] regard Ali as the supreme [[metaphysician]] of Islam.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> According to Henry Corbin, the ''[[Nahj al-Balagha]]'' may be regarded as one of the most important sources of doctrines professed by Shia thinkers, especially after 1500. Its influence can be sensed in the logical co-ordination of terms, the deduction of correct conclusions, and the creation of certain technical terms in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] which entered the literary and [[Philosophy|philosophical language]] independently of the translation into Arabic of [[Greek language|Greek]] texts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Corbin|1993|p=35}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, some hidden or occult sciences such as ''[[Al-Jafr (book)|jafr]]'', Islamic [[numerology]], and the science of the symbolic significance of the letters of the [[Arabic alphabet]], are said to have been established by Ali<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> through his having studied the texts of [[Al-Jafr (book)|al-Jafr]] and [[al-Jamia]].\n\n===Eloquence===\nAli was also a great scholar of [[Arabic literature]] and pioneered in the field of Arabic grammar and rhetoric. Numerous short sayings of Ali have become part of general Islamic culture and are quoted as aphorisms and proverbs in daily life. They have also become the basis of literary works or have been integrated into poetic verse in many languages. Already in the 8th century, literary authorities such as [['Abd al-Hamid ibn Yahya al-'Amiri]] pointed to the unparalleled eloquence of Ali's sermons and sayings, as did [[al-Jahiz]] in the following century.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/> Even staffs in the [[Divan]] of Umayyad recited Ali's sermons to improve their eloquence.<ref>\"\u062d\u0641\u0638\u062a \u0633\u0628\u0639\u064a\u0646 \u062e\u0637\u0628\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u062e\u0637\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0639 \u0641\u0641\u0627\u0636\u062a \u062b\u0645 \u0641\u0627\u0636\u062a ) \u0648\u064a\u0639\u0646\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0639 \u0623\u0645\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0645\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0627 \u0639\u0644\u064a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645 \" [http://books.rafed.net/turathona/5/ts2.html \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0645\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u0635\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0646\u0647\u062c \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u0627\u063a\u0629] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150617233159/http://books.rafed.net/turathona/5/ts2.html |date=17 June 2015 }}</ref> The most famous selection of Ali's utterances and writings has been gathered in a book called ''[[Nahj al-Balagha]]'' (''Peak of Eloquence'') by a 10th-century Shia scholar, [[Al-Sharif al-Radi]], who selected them for their singular rhetorical beauty.<ref>[http://www.islamology.com/Resources/Nahj_Imam/Sermons/bookE/sources.htm Sources of Nahj Al-Balagha] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123072458/http://www.islamology.com/Resources/Nahj_Imam/Sermons/bookE/sources.htm |date=23 November 2012 }}</ref>\n\n====The sermons without dots and alephs====\nOf note among sermons quoted in the book is the undotted sermon as well as the sermon without [[Aleph]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=|title=Sermons without 'dot's and 'Alef'|url=https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1396/01/16/1370272/%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B7%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D9%85%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B9?ref=shahrekhabar|accessdate=6 April 2017|language=fa|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406202149/https://www.tasnimnews.com/fa/news/1396/01/16/1370272/%D8%AE%D8%B7%D8%A8%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%86%D9%82%D8%B7%D9%87-%D8%A7%D9%85%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D9%85%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%86-%D8%B9?ref=shahrekhabar|archivedate=6 April 2017}}</ref> According to narrations, some companions of [[Muhammad]] had gathered somewhere discussing the role of [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]] in speaking.

After multiple failed attempts to break the fort in the [[Battle of Khaybar]], Ali was summoned, miraculously healed, and he captured the fort.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ali|url=http://www.sunnah.org/publication/khulafa_rashideen/caliph4.htm|publisher=Sunnah|accessdate=14 May 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403090029/http://sunnah.org/publication/khulafa_rashideen/caliph4.htm|archivedate=3 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nMuhammad ibn Idris [[Al-Shafi\u2018i]], founder of the [[Shafi\u2018i]] school of [[fiqh]], stated the following when asked his opinion on Ali:\n<blockquote> \"What can we say about a person whose partisans have had to hide his merits because of fear, and enemies have hidden his merits out of envy? Nevertheless between these two, his merits that have become widely known are too numerous to be counted.\"<ref name = \"Al Abbas\"/>{{rp|6}}</blockquote>\n\n====Sufi====\nAlmost all Sufi orders trace their lineage to Muhammad through Ali, an exception being [[Naqshbandi]], who go through Abu Bakr. Even in this order, there is [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]], the great great grandson of Ali. Sufis believe that Ali inherited from Muhammad the saintly power ''[[Wali|wilayah]]'' that makes the [[Sulook|spiritual journey]] to God possible.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n \nEminent Sufis such as [[Ali Hujwiri]] claim that the tradition began with Ali and [[Junayd of Baghdad]] regarded Ali as the [[Sheikh]] of the principles and practices of Sufism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alim.org/library/biography/khalifa/content/KAL/79/1 |title=Khalifa Ali bin Abu Talib \u2013 Ali, The Father of Sufism |publisher=Alim.org |accessdate=31 December 2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113035327/http://www.alim.org/library/biography/khalifa/content/KAL/79/1 |archivedate=13 November 2013  }}</ref>\n \nSufis recite ''[[Manqabat]]'' Ali in the praise of Ali.\n\n====Titles====\nAli is known by various titles, some given due to his personal qualities and others due to events in his life:<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n*''[[Murtaza|Al-Murtaza]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0631\u0652\u062a\u064e\u0636\u064e\u0649\u0670}}, \"The Chosen One\")\n*''Amir al-Mu'minin'' ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u064e\u0645\u0650\u064a\u0631 \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0645\u064f\u0624\u0652\u0645\u0650\u0646\u0650\u064a\u0646}}, \"Commander of the Faithful Ones\")\n*''Bab-e Madinatul-'Ilm'' ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u064e\u0627\u0628\u0650 \u0645\u064e\u062f\u064a\u0652\u0646\u064e\u0629\u064f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u0639\u0650\u0644\u0652\u0645}}, \"Door of City of the Knowledge\")\n*''[[Abu Turab]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u064e\u0628\u064f\u0648 \u062a\u064f\u0631\u064e\u0627\u0628}}, \"Father of the Soil\")\n*''Asad Allah'' ({{lang-ar|\u0623\u064e\u0633\u064e\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0644\u0647}}, \"Lion of [[God]]\")\n*''[[Haydar]]'' ({{lang-ar|\u062d\u064e\u064a\u0652\u062f\u064e\u0631}}, \"Braveheart\" or \"Lion\")\n*''Walad al-Ka\u02bfbah'' ({{lang-ar|\u0648\u064e\u0644\u064e\u062f \u0671\u0644\u0652\u06a9\u064e\u0639\u0652\u0628\u064e\u0629}}, \"Son of the Kaaba\")<ref name=\"Piety\">{{cite book|last1=Flaskerud|first1=Ingvild|title=Visualizing Belief and Piety in Iranian Shiism|publisher=A&C Black|isbn=9781441149077|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fH1pvM0AdNIC&pg=PA3&lpg=PA3&dq=ali%27s+birth+ka%27ba|accessdate=11 April 2017|language=en|date=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n===As a \"deity\"===\n{{Main|Ghulat}}\n \nAli is recorded in some traditions as having forbidden those who sought to worship him in his own lifetime.<ref name=\"Peters 2003 320\u2013321\">See:\n* {{Harvnb|Peters|2003|pp=320\u2013321}}\n* {{Harvnb|Halm|2004|pp=154\u2013159}}</ref>\n\n====Alawites====\nSome groups such as the [[Alawites]] are claimed to believe that Ali was God [[Incarnation|incarnate]]. They are described as ''ghulat'' ({{lang-ar|\u063a\u064f\u0644\u064e\u0627\u0629}}, \"exaggerators\") by the majority of Islamic scholars. These groups have, according to traditionalist Muslims, left Islam due to their exaggeration of a human being's praiseworthy traits.<ref name=\"Peters 2003 320\u2013321\"/>\n\n====Ali-Illahism====\n[[Ali-Illahism]], a [[syncretism|syncretic]] religion, centres on the belief that there have been successive [[incarnations]] of their [[Deity]] throughout history, and reserves particular reverence for 'Ali, the son-in-law of Muhammad, who is considered one such incarnation.<ref>Layard, Austen Henry, Discoveries in the Ruins of Nineveh and Babylon, Page 216</ref>\n\n====Druze====\nThe [[Druze]] faith, a syncretic religion, holds that God was [[incarnation|incarnated]] in human beings, especially [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah]] a descendant of Ali.\n\n==Historiography==\n{{See also|Historiography of early Islam}}\n\nThe [[primary sources]] for scholarship on the life of Ali are the Qur'an and ''ahadith'', as well as other [[Historiography of early Islam|texts of early Islamic history]]. The extensive [[secondary source]]s include, in addition to works by Sunni and Shia Muslims, writings by [[Christian Arabs]], [[Hindus]], and other non-Muslims from the Middle East and Asia and a few works by modern western scholars. However, many of the early Islamic sources are coloured to some extent by a positive or negative bias towards Ali.<ref name=\"Britannica\"/>\n\nThere had been a common tendency among the earlier western scholars to consider narrations and reports gathered in later periods as fabrications, due to their tendency towards later Sunni and Shia partisan positions. This led these scholars to regard certain reported events as inauthentic or irrelevant. For example, [[Leone Caetani]] considered the attribution of historical reports to [['Abd Allah ibn 'Abbas|Ibn Abbas]] and Aisha as mostly fictitious while proffering accounts reported without ''[[isnad]]'' by the early compilers of history like Ibn Ishaq. Wilferd Madelung has rejected the stance of indiscriminately dismissing everything not included in \"early sources\" and in this approach tendentiousness alone is no evidence for late origin. According to him, Caetani's approach is inconsistent. Madelung and some later historians do not reject the narrations which have been compiled in later periods and try to judge them in the context of history and on the basis of their compatibility with the events and figures.<ref>{{Harvnb|Madelung|1997|p=xi, 19 and 20}}</ref>\n\nUntil the rise of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], few books were written and most of the reports had been oral. The most notable work prior to this period is ''[[The Book of Sulaym ibn Qays]]'', written by [[Sulaym ibn Qays]], a companion of Ali who lived before the Abbasids.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lawson|2005|p=59}}</ref> When paper was introduced to Muslim society, numerous monographs were written between 750 and 950. According to Robinson, at least twenty-one separate monographs have been composed on the Battle of Siffin. [[Abi Mikhnaf]] is one of the most renowned writers of this period who tried to gather all of the reports. Ninth- and tenth-century historians collected, selected and arranged the available narrations. However, most of these monographs do not exist any more except for a few which have been used in later works such as [[History of the Prophets and Kings]] by [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]] (d.923).<ref>{{Harvnb|Robinson|2003|p=28 and 34}}</ref>\n\nShia of Iraq actively participated in writing monographs but most of those works have been lost. On the other hand, in the 8th and 9th century Ali's descendants such as [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] and [[Jafar al-Sadiq]] narrated his quotations and reports which have been gathered in Shia hadith books. The later Shia works written after the 10th century are about biographies of [[The Fourteen Infallibles]] and [[Twelve Imams]]. The earliest surviving work and one of the most important works in this field is ''[[Kitab al-Irshad]]'' by [[Shaykh Mufid]] (d. 1022). The author has dedicated the first part of his book to a detailed account of Ali. There are also some books known as ''Man\u0101qib'' which describe Ali's character from a religious viewpoint. Such works also constitute a kind of historiography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/message-thaqalayn/general-message-thaqalayn/glance-historiography-shiite-culture-rasul-jafariyan|title=A Glance at Historiography in Shiite Culture|work=Al-Islam.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Islam|Shia Islam}}\n* [[Outline of Islam]]\n* [[Glossary of Islam]]\n* [[Index of Islam-related articles]]\n\n<!-- PLEASE RESPECT ALPHABETICAL ORDER -->\n* [[Alevism]]\n* [[Ali in Muslim culture]]\n* [[Al-Farooq (title)]]\n* [[Hashemites]] Royal Family of Jordan\n* [[Idris I]] The First King of Morocco Founded 788\n* [[List of expeditions of Muhammad|List of expeditions of Ali during Muhammad's era]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist|2}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em|refs=\n<ref name=\"Al-Islam\">{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/articles/life-commander-faithful-ali-ibn-abu-talib|last=Al-Islam|title=The Life of the Commander of the Faithful Ali Ibn Abu Talib (as)|accessdate=6 December 2015}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Iranica\">{{cite encyclopedia|title = Al\u012b ibn Abu Talib|encyclopedia = Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica|accessdate = 16 December 2010|url = http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ali-b-abi-taleb|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110429163734/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ali-b-abi-taleb|archivedate = 29 April 2011|url-status=live|df = mdy-all}}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Britannica\">{{cite encyclopedia|last=Nasr |first=Seyyed Hossein |authorlink=Seyyed Hossein Nasr |title=Ali |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online |accessdate=12 October 2007 |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc. |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9005712/Ali |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018014146/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9005712/Ali |archivedate=18 October 2007 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{cite book| last = Ahmed| first = M.
