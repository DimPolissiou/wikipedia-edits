As they spend time together, they form a bond of trust, understanding and friendship. Prerna starts falling for Anurag. Meanwhile, Komolika Chaubey makes her entry. She is arrogant, evil and attracts male attention wherever she goes. While Anurag realises his feelings for Prerna, Komolika starts getting interested in him.\n\nAnurag and Prerna confess their feelings, plan to marry each other and consummate their relationship. Seeing Prerna and Anurag plan a future together, Komolika decides to create misunderstandings between them. She asks Anurag to marry her in order to save Prerna's house. Compelled, Anurag agrees. Unaware of the truth, Prerna is left shocked. She gets hit by a car and is taken to the hospital where the doctor reveals her to be pregnant.\n\nHurt and rebellious, Prerna enters the Basu house, successfully exposes Komolika and gets her arrested. Komolika escapes and comes back to kill Prerna but instead falls down the terrace and goes missing. Anurag and Prerna reunite and get engaged.\n\nRishabh Bajaj, a ruthless and cunning businessman enters. He falsely frames Anurag and gets him jailed. Further, he asks Prerna to marry him in exchange of Anurag's freedom. Helpless, Prerna agrees. Heartbroken and devastated, Anurag questions Prerna. She lies to him, hoping he moves on but Anurag remains adamant and refuses to give up on their love.\n\nRishabh starts falling for Prerna. Knowing that Prerna is still in love with Anurag, Rishabh tries to kill him. Kukki tries to stop Rishabh but ends up getting hurt. Guilty, Rishabh steps back while Anurag and Prerna unite.\n\nVengeful, Komolika makes a comeback by changing her face through plastic surgery. Prerna reveals to Anurag about her pregnancy and the two rejoice as they get ready to marry. Komolika causes Anurag's accident.\n\n===One month later===\nAnurag loses his memory. Komolika fakes an identity and misuses the opportunity to make Anurag and the Basu's believe that they got married. Prerna discovers Komolika's identity and decides to expose her but chooses to refrain in fear of affecting Anurag's brain and memory. Komolika tries to kill Prerna and her child multiple times but fails.\n\nPrerna gives birth to Sneha and Anurag regains his memory. They rejoice and plan to marry. Komolika threatens to frame Prerna for murder by leaking footage of her pushing Viraj off the cliff. She further asks Anurag to accept her and leave Prerna. Helpless, Anurag pretends to betray Prerna and pushes her off a bridge, but she is saved by Rishabh. Prerna reaches the orphanage where Komolika abandoned Sneha and is devastated to see it on fire. Reeling from shock and heartbreak, Prerna moves to London with Rishabh.\n\n===Eight years later===\nPrerna is a successful businesswoman in London while Anurag's business thrives in Kolkata. Prerna maintains a formal relationship with Rishabh and detests Anurag for his betrayal whereas Anurag lives in guilt and detests Komolika who has taken over the Basu house. Nivedita and Anupam have separated. \n\nPrerna leaves for Kolkata in order to seek revenge from Anurag. Kukki and Kaushik start off by disliking each other, constantly bickering everytime they meet. Prerna and Rishabh succeed in taking over the project which Anurag has been dreaming of.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Parth Samthaan]] as Anurag Basu\u2013 Mohini and Moloy's son; Rakhi, Nivedita and Tapur's brother; Komolika's husband; Prerna's former husband; Sneha and Diya's father (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Erica Fernandes]] as Prerna Sharma \u2013 Veena and Rajesh's daughter; Shekhar, Shivani and Mahesh's sister; Anurag's former wife; Sneha's mother (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Hina Khan]]/[[Aamna Sharif]] as Komolika Chaubey - Siddhant's daughter; Anurag's wife; Mishka and Ronit's sister; Diya's mother (2018\u20132019)\n* [[Karan Singh Grover]] as Rishabh Bajaj\u2013  Samira's former husband; Kukki's father (2019\u2013present)\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Shubhaavi Choksey]] as Mohini Basu\u2013 Moloy's wife; Rakhi, Nivedita, Anurag and Tapur's mother (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Uday Tikekar]] as Moloy Basu\u2013 Prosenjit's brother; Rajesh's childhood friend; Mohini's husband; Rakhi, Nivedita, Anurag and Tapur's father (2018\u2013present)\n* Kanupriya Pandit as Veena Sharma\u2013 Rajesh's wife; Shekhar, Prerna, Shivani and Mahesh's mother (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Kali Prasad Mukherjee]] as Rajesh Sharma\u2013 Moloy's childhood friend; Veena's husband; Shekhar, Prerna, Shivani and Mahesh's father (2018\u20132019)\n* [[Parull Chaudhry]] as Rakhi Basu\u2013 Mohini and Moloy's daughter; Nivedita, Anurag and Tapur's sister; Subodh's former wife; Tanisha and Kaushik's mother (2020\u2013present)\n* Vidyut Aryan as Subodh Chakraborty\u2013 Rakhi's former husband; Tanisha and Kaushik's father (2020\u2013present)\n* [[Pooja Banerjee]] as Nivedita Basu\u2013 Mohini and Moloy's daughter; Rakhi, Anurag and Tapur's sister; Anupam's former wife (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Sahil Anand]] as Anupam Sengupta\u2013 Nivedita's former husband (2018\u2013present)\n* Upasana Salunke/Priyal Mahajan/Aastha Abhay/[[Garima Parihar]] as Tapur Basu\u2013 Mohini and Moloy's daughter; Rakhi, Nivedita and Anurag's sister; Sahil's former fiance (2018)/(2018\u20132019)/(2019\u20132020)/(2020\u2013present)\n* Karan Arora as Shekhar Sharma\u2013 Veena and Rajesh's son; Prerna, Shivani and Mahesh's brother; Suman's husband (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Antara Banerjee]]/Ritu Chauhan as Suman Sharma\u2013 Shekhar's wife (2018\u20132019)/(2019\u2013present)\n* Charvi Saraf as Shivani Sharma\u2013 Veena and Rajesh's daughter; Shekhar, Prerna and Mahesh's sister; Ronit's former girlfriend (2018\u2013present)\n* Karan Bhanushali/Mridul Das as Mahesh Sharma\u2013 Veena and Rajesh's son; Shekhar, Prerna and Shivani's brother; Kajal's husband (2018\u20132020)/(2020\u2013present)\n* Minal Mogam as Kajal Sharma\u2013 Mahesh's wife (2020\u2013present)\n* [[Adi Irani]] as Siddhant Chaubey\u2013 Komolika, Mishka and Ronit's father (2018\u20132019)\n* Ariah Aggarwal as Mishka Chaubey\u2013 Siddhant's daughter; Komolika and Ronit's sister; Anurag's former girlfriend (2018\u20132019)\n* Tarun Mahilani as Ronit Chaubey\u2013 Siddhant's son; Komolika and Mishka's brother; Shivani's former boyfriend (2018\u2013present)\n* Aditi Sanwal as Kukki Bajaj\u2013 Samira and Rishabh's daughter; (2020\u2013present)\n* [[Urfi Javed]] as Tanisha Chakraborty\u2013 Rakhi and Subodh's daughter; Kaushik's sister (2020\u2013present)\n* Kunal Thakur as Kaushik Chakraborty\u2013 Rakhi and Subodh's son; Tanisha's brother (2020\u2013present)\n* [[Alka Amin]] as Sharda Bajaj\u2013 Rishabh's aunt; Tanvi's adoptive mother (2019)\n* [[Sonyaa Ayodhya]] as Tanvi Bajaj\u2013 Sharda's adoptive daughter; Rishabh's family friend (2019)\n* [[Namik Paul]] as Viraj Bhardwaj\u2013 Prerna's ex-fiance; Komolika's accomplice (2020)\n* [[Sanjay Swaraj]] as Naveen Chandra Chattopadhyay\u2013 Ronita and Madhuri's husband; Mohini's namesake brother; Prerna's former husband.

As they spend time together, they form a bond of trust, understanding and friendship. Prerna starts falling for Anurag. Meanwhile, Komolika Chaubey makes her entry. She is arrogant, evil and attracts male attention wherever she goes. While Anurag realises his feelings for Prerna, Komolika starts getting interested in him.\n\nAnurag and Prerna confess their feelings, plan to marry each other and consummate their relationship. Seeing Prerna and Anurag plan a future together, Komolika decides to create misunderstandings between them. She asks Anurag to marry her in order to save Prerna's house. Compelled, Anurag agrees. Unaware of the truth, Prerna is left shocked. She gets hit by a car and is taken to the hospital where the doctor reveals her to be pregnant.\n\nHurt and rebellious, Prerna enters the Basu house, successfully exposes Komolika and gets her arrested. Komolika escapes and comes back to kill Prerna but instead falls down the terrace and goes missing. Anurag and Prerna reunite and get engaged.\n\nRishabh Bajaj, a ruthless and cunning businessman enters. He falsely frames Anurag and gets him jailed. Further, he asks Prerna to marry him in exchange of Anurag's freedom. Helpless, Prerna agrees. Heartbroken and devastated, Anurag questions Prerna. She lies to him, hoping he moves on but Anurag remains adamant and refuses to give up on their love.\n\nRishabh starts falling for Prerna. Knowing that Prerna is still in love with Anurag, Rishabh tries to kill him. Kukki tries to stop Rishabh but ends up getting hurt. Guilty, Rishabh steps back while Anurag and Prerna unite.\n\nVengeful, Komolika makes a comeback. Prerna reveals to Anurag about her pregnancy and the two rejoice as they get ready to marry. Komolika causes Anurag's accident.\n\n===One month later===\nAnurag loses his memory. Komolika fakes an identity and misuses the opportunity to make Anurag and the Basu's believe that they got married. Prerna discovers Komolika's identity and decides to expose her but chooses to refrain in fear of affecting Anurag's brain and memory. Komolika tries to kill Prerna and her child multiple times but fails.\n\nPrerna gives birth to Sneha and Anurag regains his memory. They rejoice and plan to marry. Komolika threatens to frame Prerna for murder by leaking footage of her pushing Viraj off the cliff. She further asks Anurag to accept her and leave Prerna. Helpless, Anurag pretends to betray Prerna and pushes her off a bridge, but she is saved by Rishabh. Prerna reaches the orphanage where Komolika abandoned Sneha and is devastated to see it on fire. Reeling from shock and heartbreak, Prerna moves to London with Rishabh.\n\n===Eight years later===\nPrerna is a successful businesswoman in London while Anurag's business thrives in Kolkata. Prerna maintains a formal relationship with Rishabh and Anurag hates Komolika. Prerna detests Anurag for his betrayal while he lives in guilt. Komolika has taken over the Basu house. Nivedita and Anupam have separated. Prerna leaves for Kolkata in order to seek revenge from Anurag. Kukki and Kaushik start off by disliking each other, constantly bickering everytime they meet.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main===\n* [[Parth Samthaan]] as Anurag Basu\u2013 Mohini and Moloy's son; Rakhi, Nivedita and Tapur's brother; Komolika's husband; Prerna's former husband; Sneha and Diya's father (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Erica Fernandes]] as Prerna Sharma \u2013 Veena and Rajesh's daughter; Shekhar, Shivani and Mahesh's sister; Anurag's former wife; Sneha's mother (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Hina Khan]]/[[Aamna Sharif]] as Komolika Chaubey - Siddhant's daughter; Anurag's wife; Mishka and Ronit's sister; Diya's mother (2018\u20132019)\n* [[Karan Singh Grover]] as Rishabh Bajaj\u2013  Samira's former husband; Kukki's father (2019\u2013present)\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Shubhaavi Choksey]] as Mohini Basu\u2013 Moloy's wife; Rakhi, Nivedita, Anurag and Tapur's mother (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Uday Tikekar]] as Moloy Basu\u2013 Prosenjit's brother; Rajesh's childhood friend; Mohini's husband; Rakhi, Nivedita, Anurag and Tapur's father (2018\u2013present)\n* Kanupriya Pandit as Veena Sharma\u2013 Rajesh's wife; Shekhar, Prerna, Shivani and Mahesh's mother (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Kali Prasad Mukherjee]] as Rajesh Sharma\u2013 Moloy's childhood friend; Veena's husband; Shekhar, Prerna, Shivani and Mahesh's father (2018\u20132019)\n* [[Parull Chaudhry]] as Rakhi Basu\u2013 Mohini and Moloy's daughter; Nivedita, Anurag and Tapur's sister; Subodh's former wife; Tanisha and Kaushik's mother (2020\u2013present)\n* Vidyut Aryan as Subodh Chakraborty\u2013 Rakhi's former husband; Tanisha and Kaushik's father (2020\u2013present)\n* [[Pooja Banerjee]] as Nivedita Basu\u2013 Mohini and Moloy's daughter; Rakhi, Anurag and Tapur's sister; Anupam's former wife (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Sahil Anand]] as Anupam Sengupta\u2013 Nivedita's former husband (2018\u2013present)\n* Upasana Salunke/Priyal Mahajan/Aastha Abhay/[[Garima Parihar]] as Tapur Basu\u2013 Mohini and Moloy's daughter; Rakhi, Nivedita and Anurag's sister; Sahil's former fiance (2018)/(2018\u20132019)/(2019\u20132020)/(2020\u2013present)\n* Karan Arora as Shekhar Sharma\u2013 Veena and Rajesh's son; Prerna, Shivani and Mahesh's brother; Suman's husband (2018\u2013present)\n* [[Antara Banerjee]]/Ritu Chauhan as Suman Sharma\u2013 Shekhar's wife (2018\u20132019)/(2019\u2013present)\n* Charvi Saraf as Shivani Sharma\u2013 Veena and Rajesh's daughter; Shekhar, Prerna and Mahesh's sister; Ronit's former girlfriend (2018\u2013present)\n* Karan Bhanushali/Mridul Das as Mahesh Sharma\u2013 Veena and Rajesh's son; Shekhar, Prerna and Shivani's brother; Kajal's husband (2018\u20132020)/(2020\u2013present)\n* Minal Mogam as Kajal Sharma\u2013 Mahesh's wife (2020\u2013present)\n* [[Adi Irani]] as Siddhant Chaubey\u2013 Komolika, Mishka and Ronit's father (2018\u20132019)\n* Ariah Aggarwal as Mishka Chaubey\u2013 Siddhant's daughter; Komolika and Ronit's sister; Anurag's former girlfriend (2018\u20132019)\n* Tarun Mahilani as Ronit Chaubey\u2013 Siddhant's son; Komolika and Mishka's brother; Shivani's former boyfriend (2018\u2013present)\n* Aditi Sanwal as Kukki Bajaj\u2013 Samira and Rishabh's daughter; (2020\u2013present)\n* [[Urfi Javed]] as Tanisha Chakraborty\u2013 Rakhi and Subodh's daughter; Kaushik's sister (2020\u2013present)\n* Kunal Thakur as Kaushik Chakraborty\u2013 Rakhi and Subodh's son; Tanisha's brother (2020\u2013present)\n* [[Alka Amin]] as Sharda Bajaj\u2013 Rishabh's aunt; Tanvi's adoptive mother (2019)\n* [[Sonyaa Ayodhya]] as Tanvi Bajaj\u2013 Sharda's adoptive daughter; Rishabh's family friend (2019)\n* [[Namik Paul]] as Viraj Bhardwaj\u2013 Prerna's ex-fiance; Komolika's accomplice (2020)\n* [[Sanjay Swaraj]] as Naveen Chandra Chattopadhyay\u2013 Ronita and Madhuri's husband; Mohini's namesake brother; Prerna's former husband.
