[[Hal Draper]] defined socialism from above as the philosophy which employs an [[elite]] [[Administration (government)|administration]] to run the [[socialist state]]. The other side of socialism is a more democratic [[socialism from below]].<ref name=\"Two Souls\">{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Two Souls of Socialism|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm|date=1963}}</ref> Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer, more [[Marxist]] version of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=James D.|title=Socialism Since 1889: A Biographical History|date=1988|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=Totowa|isbn=978-0-389-20813-6}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was \"conducive to superstitious authoritarianism\". Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently. In either case, this new ruling class is likely to see its goal as an Education Dictatorship over the masses \u2013 to Do Them Good, of course \u2013 the dictatorship being exercised by an elite party which suppresses all control from below, or by benevolent despots or Savior-Leaders of some kind, or by Shaw's \"Supermen,\" by eugenic manipulators, by Proudhon's \"anarchist\" managers or Saint-Simon's technocrats or their more modern equivalents \u2013 with up-to-date terms and new verbal screens which can be hailed as fresh social theory as against \"nineteenth-century Marxism.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/>}}\n\nThe idea of socialism from above is much more frequently discussed in elite circles than socialism from below\u2014even if that is the Marxist ideal\u2014because it is more practical.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\n=== Utopian socialism ===\nThe first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a [[meritocratic]] or [[technocratic]] society based on individual talent. [[Henri de Saint-Simon]] is regarded as the first individual to coin the term [[socialism]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|publisher=Macrohistory|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm|title=Birth of the Socialist Idea|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005). ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|author-link=Alan O.

According to Hayek, it is in this way that it becomes possible for [[totalitarian]] leaders to rise to power as happened in the years following World War I.<ref name=\"Hayek\"/> [[Austrian School]] economists such as Hayek and his mentor [[Ludwig Mises]] also continually used the word ''socialism'' as a synonym for authoritarian socialism, central planning and state socialism, conflating it with fascism,<ref name=\"Mises\">Mises, Ludwig (1936) [1922].

In reply, Hayek warned against confusing \"totalitarianism with authoritarianism\" and said that he was unaware of \"any totalitarian governments in Latin America.

Other features that are common to modern authoritarian [[socialist states]] (starting in the 20th century) include an emphasis on [[heavy industry]] for [[Economic development|development]], a [[Single-party state|single-party system]] to propel the goals of the [[State (polity)|state]] forward, the extensive use of [[propaganda]] to do the same and more.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/><ref name=\"Lowy\"/><ref name=\"Amandae\"/>\n\nSoviet advocates and socialists responded to these criticisms by highlighting the ideological differences in the concept of [[Liberty#Politics|freedom]].

The party's decisions are so integrated into public life that its economic and non-economic decisions are part of their overall actions.\n* State ownership of the means of production in which natural resources and capital belong to society.\n* Central economic planning, the main characteristic of an authoritarian, state socialist economy. The market is planned by a central government agency, generally a state planning commission.\n* Socially-equitable distribution of the national income in which goods and services are provided for free by the state that supplement private consumption.\n\nThis economic model is greatly characterized by the government's central planning.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\">Wilczynski, J.

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''. New York: Praeger.</ref> The central planning authority is responsible for five specific tasks:\n# Determining the criteria for the economic calculations of the planning decisions.\n# Determining and quantifying targets to be achieved within the a specified period.\n# Coordinating targets to ensure the plan is consistent and reliable.\n# Determining the methods to ensure the realization of the plan.\n# Revising targets in accordance to changing economic calculations.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/>\n\nThe planning process involved the creation of one-year plans, five-year plans and long-term plans. The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities. Structural changes were a main theme.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/><ref>Sejna, Jan (1986). ''Decision-Making in Communist Countries: An Inside View''.

It has been argued that authoritarian socialist states failed because they did not create rules and operational criteria for the efficient operation of [[state enterprise]]s in their administrative, command allocation of [[resources]] and [[commodities]] and the lack of [[democracy]] in the political systems that the authoritarian socialist economies were combined with. A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals.

[[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland.

Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\n{{see also|Soviet-type economic planning}}\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag.

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n==== Maoism ====\n[[Maoism]] is an adapted Sino-centric version of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]].<ref name=\"Esh\">{{cite journal|last=Esherick|first=Joseph W.|title=On the \"Restoration of Capitalism\": Mao and Marxist Theory|journal=Modern China|date=January 1979|volume=5|issue=1|pages=41\u201377|doi=10.1177/009770047900500102}}</ref> While believing in [[democratic centralism]], where party decisions are brought about by scrutiny and debate and then are binding upon all members of the party once implemented, Mao did not accept dissenters to the party's decisions.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> Through the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], Mao attempted to purge any subversive idea\u2014especially capitalist or Western threat\u2014with heavy force, justifying his actions as the necessary way for the central authority to keep power.<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/>\n\nAt the same time, Mao emphasized the importance of cultural heritage and individual choice as a way of creating this national unity. He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment. In his system, the proletariat and peasantry were responsible for rising up against the bureaucracy and capital of the state.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Joining the peasant class with the [[bourgeoisie]] of the countryside (the land-holding, local farmers), the group was able to stifle the claims to power by the wealthier, urban landowners through the banner of [[communism]]. Only when this collection of [[peasant]]s and [[petty bourgeoisie]] existed could Mao grow his own, custom bureaucracy.<ref name=\"Esh\"/> Once this unity was established, Mao argued that the people were the ones who could control the state, but his government's intense control over the citizenry emphasizes the contradiction in his theory\u2014a contradiction, he maintained, was a necessary reality of their specialized system <ref name=\"Esh\"/>\n\n=== Arab world ===\n{{see also|Arab socialism}}\nSocialism was introduced into the Middle East in the form of [[Populism|populist]] policies designed to galvanize the [[working class]] into overthrowing [[colonial powers]] and their domestic allies. These policies were held by authoritarian states interested in the rapid industrialization and social equalization of Arab nations and often were characterized by redistributive or protectionist economic policies, lower class mobilization, charismatic leaders and promises to improve national living standards.<ref name=\"New Authoritarianism\">{{cite book|last=King|first=Stephen J.|title=The New Authoritarianism in The Middle East and North Africa|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington}}</ref> Those states were progressive in terms of the colonial development that had occurred thus far.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness. [...] But the government cannot and must not do it all. It must be helped by the party. [...] Our party must be the consciousness of the masses\".<ref name=\"Gregor\"/>\n\n==== Ghana ====\nIn the same vein as Senghor, socialist leader [[Kwame Nkrumah]] sought to advance this one-party, nationalized form of socialist obedience.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state. Gradually, those who were not granted or did not desire entrance into the party created regions blocs.<ref name=\"Redl\">{{cite book|last=Riedl|first=Rachel|title=Authoritarian Origins of Democratic Party Systems in Africa|date=February 2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=108}}</ref> The [[Ashanti people|Asante]] emerged as a regional force capable political sway.

In the system, all Tanzanains were encouraged to run for office, with no campaign funding allowed. Speeches in the election would not focus on the national issues, but rather on the quality of the individual, each of whom would be closely controlled by TANU.<ref name=\"Pratt\"/> Structurally, the power was shared along regional boundaries, giving increased policy making power and resource allocation to these regions.

[[Hal Draper]] defined socialism from above as the philosophy which employs an [[elite]] [[Administration (government)|administration]] to run the [[socialist state]]. The other side of socialism is a more democratic [[socialism from below]].<ref name=\"Two Souls\">{{cite web|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Two Souls of Socialism|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/twosouls/twosouls.htm|date=1963}}</ref> Draper viewed socialism from below as being the purer, more [[Marxist]] version of [[Socialist mode of production|socialism]].<ref name=\"History\">{{cite book|last=Young|first=James D.|title=Socialism Since 1889: A Biographical History|date=1988|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|location=Totowa|isbn=978-0-389-20813-6}}</ref> [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were devoutly opposed to any socialist institution that was \"conducive to superstitious authoritarianism\". Draper makes the argument that this division echoes the division between \"reformist or revolutionary, peaceful or violent, democratic or authoritarian, etc.\"<ref name=\"Two Souls\"/> and identifies [[elitism]] as being one of the six major varieties of socialism from above, arguing: {{quote|We have mentioned several cases of this conviction that socialism is the business of a new ruling minority, non-capitalist in nature and therefore guaranteed pure, imposing its own domination either temporarily (for a mere historical era) or even permanently.

[[Henri de Saint-Simon]] is regarded as the first individual to coin the term [[socialism]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fsmitha.com/h3/h44-ph.html|title=Adam Smith|publisher=Macrohistory|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> Saint-Simon was fascinated by the enormous potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of [[capitalism]] and would be based on [[equal opportunities]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anu.edu.au/polsci/marx/contemp/pamsetc/socfrombel/sfb_2.htm|title=Birth of the Socialist Idea|publisher=Australian National University|accessdate=2 June 2010}}</ref> He advocated the creation of a society in which each person was [[To each according to his contribution|ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work]].<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/> The key focus of Saint-Simon's socialism was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was the key to progress.<ref>Newman, Michael (2005). ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction''. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.</ref> This was accompanied by a desire to implement a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific progress and material progress.<ref name=\"fsmitha.com\"/>\n\nThe first major fictional work that proposed an authoritarian socialist state was [[Edward Bellamy]]'s novel ''[[Looking Backward]]'' which depicted a [[bureaucratic]] [[Utopian socialism|socialist utopia]]. Bellamy distanced himself from radical socialist values and in many ways his ideal society still imitated many of the systems in late 19th century United States. However, his book served as the inspiration for a mass political movement called nationalism within the United States in the late 1800s. Those [[Nationalist Clubs]], so called because of their desire to nationalize [[industry]], were strong supporters of the [[People's Party (United States)|populists]], who wanted the [[nationalization]] of the railroad and telegraph systems. Despite their propaganda and involvement in politics, the nationalist movement began to decline in 1893 due to the financial difficulties of its main publications and Bellamy's failing health and essentially disappeared by the turn of the century.<ref name=\"History\"/>\n\nIn the society depicted in the novel, private property has been abolished in favor of state ownership, social classes were eliminated and all work which was minimal and relatively easy was done voluntarily by all citizens between the ages of 21 and 45. Workers were rewarded and recognized via a ranking system based on the army.<ref name=\"Bellamy\">{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Edward|title=Looking Backward: 2000-1887|url=https://archive.org/details/lookingbackward01bellgoog|date=1888|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}</ref> Most importantly, the government is the most powerful and respected institution, necessary for providing and maintaining this [[utopia]].<ref name=\"History\"/> Arthur Lipow identifies the bureaucratic ruling of this ideal society as a quasi-military organization of both economic and social relations.<ref name=\"Lipow\">{{cite book|last=Lipow|first=Arthur|title=Authoritarian Socialism in America: Edward Bellamy and the Nationalist Movement|date=1991|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520075436}}</ref> Bellamy elevated the modern military as a catalyst for national interest.<ref name=\"Bellamy\"/>\n\nThe biggest critique of Bellamy's society is that it is based on the idea of socialism from above. The regime is imposed on the people by an expert elite and there is no democratic control or individual liberty. Lipow argues that this inherently leads to [[authoritarianism]], writing: \"If the workers and the vast majority were a brutish mass, there could be no question of forming a political movement out of them nor of giving them the task of creating a socialist society. The new institutions would not be created and shaped from below but would, of necessity, correspond to the plan laid down in advance by the utopian planner\".<ref name=\"Lipow\"/>\n\n=== Austrian and Chicago schools of economics ===\n[[Friedrich Hayek]], an Austrian-born economist, was one of the leading academic critics of [[collectivism]] in the 20th century. He recognized and was acutely critical of the trends of socialism from above in collectivism, including theories that were based in voluntary cooperation.<ref name=\"Ebenstein\">{{cite book|last=Ebenstein|first=Alan|author-link=Alan O.

''Economic Devolution in Eastern Europe''.

The one-year plans contained schedules and details that addressed current production and market equilibrium issues. The five-year plans integrated the political, military and economic strategy that would be pursued in the next five years as well as changes in capacity and production rates. It was done by a team of around the fifty leading experts from all the departments, ministries, professional and scientific organizations. The long-term plans encompassed a global strategy development. This plan was about goals for the state and society, not about individual responsibilities.

A form of competitive socialism that rejects [[dictatorship]] and authoritarian allocation of resources in favor of [[economic democracy]] could work and prove superior to the [[market economy]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Comparing Economic Systems in the Twenty-First|last1=Gregory|first1=Paul|last2=Stuart|first2=Robert|publisher=South-Western College Pub|year=2003|isbn=0-618-26181-8|page=152}}</ref> Others have argued that a central deficiency of such economic planning was that it was not premised on final consumer demand, but that such a system would be increasingly feasible with advances in information technology.<ref>Mandel, Ernest (1986).

The party makes all the decisions, but they should take into account the desires of the population and these desires were then to be weighted into the decision making. According to Article 11 of its [[1977 Constitution of the Soviet Union|1977 constitution]], the main goal of the [[Soviet Union]] was to \"raise the material and cultural standards of the working people\". Marxist thought and its interpretation by the Soviet Union dictated that private ownership was to be banned and the nationalization of all aspects of production a necessity, yet some things were not nationalized for the sake of economic efficiency or production targets. There was an emphasis on rapid industrialization, the development of heavy industry, relegation of consumer production as non-essential and collectivization of agriculture. [[Soviet-type economic planning|Soviet-type economies]] also used a larger proportion of their resources on investment than do market economies. The issue with this was that current consumption was undercut because of the over-investment. All these actions supported the purposes of the state, not the people.<ref name=\"Ader\">Ader, Emile Bertrand (1970). ''Communism, Classic and Contemporary''. Woodbury: Barron's Educational Series.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1940s\u20131970s, the [[economy of the Soviet Union]] grew at a rate that outpaced that of Western European nations, but by the 1980s the Soviet economy was in shambles. This has been attributed to the [[Era of Stagnation]], a more tolerant central government and increasing military spending caused by the [[nuclear arms race]] with the United States, especially under [[Ronald Reagan]], whose administration pursued more aggressive relations with the Soviet Union instead of [[d\u00e9tente]] that was preferred in the 1970s. The end to the [[post-war consensus]] and [[Keynesianism]] in the 1970s and the rise of [[neoliberalism]] and [[economic globalization]] in the 1980s also caused problems as they forced the Soviet Union and other countries to adapt and reform themselves. Unlike China, the Soviet's failure to do so further contributed to its dissolution in December 1991. Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union to guarantee employment to all of its labor force, it did not satisfy the human desires of its laborers because \"people want land, not collectivization. Consumers want goods, not gigantic industrial enterprise. Workers want better wages and higher living standards, not citations and medals. [And] an economy cannot be politically tailored to perfection\".<ref name=\"Ader\"/><ref name=\"Wellisz\">Wellisz, Stanislaw (1964).

In 1913, prior to both [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917, the former Soviet Union had a GDP per capita of $1,488 in 1990 international dollars which grew 461% to $6,871 by 1990. After its dissolution in December 1991, this figure fell to $3,893 by 1998. By comparison, Western Europe grew from a higher base of $3,688 international dollars by a comparable 457% to $16,872 in the same period and reached $17,921 by 1998.<ref name=\"Maddison\">Maddison, Angus (2001).

There were countries that chose to introduce the new economic system gradually ([[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[East Germany]] and [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]]) and countries that decided to first prepare theoretically, then experimentation at different levels and then in a large scale ([[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]] and [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]]). [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]] was set apart because the first stage of its transition consisted of economic recovery and then socialism was gradually implemented. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] differed from other Eastern European countries in that after 1950 it modified its economic system by making self-management the base of enterprise activity.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/> There were also a few differences between the economic model of the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries such as East Germany and Poland. Czechoslovakia and East Germany were administered along regional lines. Poland retained a centralized system similar to the Stalinist centralization of the Soviet Union.<ref name=\"Wellisz\"/> The Eastern European countries differed from the Soviet Union in that they had greater flexibility in the management of subordinate firms, the market was assigned a greater importance, accessible foreign trade and liberalization of the exchange of capital goods. There was also less bureaucracy than in the Soviet Union involved in the planning of the countries.<ref name=\"Lavigne\"/>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc countries achieved high rates of economic and technical progress, promoted industrialization and ensured steady growth rates of labor productivity and rises in the standard of living<ref>Shiryayev, Y.; Sokolov, A.

Countries such as China that did not isolate and instead reformed themselves thrived, but this did not happen in most Eastern Bloc countries as they depended upon the Soviet Union, especially for significant amounts of materials.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> From the end of the World War II to the mid-1970s, the economy of the Eastern Bloc steadily increased at the same rate as the economy in Western Europe, with the least none-reforming [[Stalinist]] nations of the Eastern Bloc having a stronger economy then the reformist-Stalinist states.<ref>Teichova, Alice; Matis, Herbert (2003).

Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-521-79278-3}}.</ref> While most Western European economies essentially began to approach the GDP per capita levels of the United States during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Eastern Bloc countries did not,<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/> with per capita GDPs trailing significantly behind their comparable Western European counterparts.<ref name=\"Hardt&Kaufman\"/>\n\nFollowing the fall of the [[Eastern Bloc]] with the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the economies of [[post-Soviet states]] quickly fell apart and took a long time to return to pre-1989 levels.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> Not only growth plummeted following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in December 1991, but also living standards declined, drug use, homelessness and poverty skyrocketed and suicides increased dramatically. Growth did not begin to return to pre-reform-era levels for approximately fifteen years. Some scholars have claimed that the Soviet model's industrialization and modernization laid the groundwork for their later [[economic growth]], without which their current market-oriented economy may have not thrived or growth as much, or that it provided a better quality of life than market economies.<ref name=\"Cereseto\"/> The [[1991 Soviet Union referendum]] (77% on an 80% turnout voted to preserve the Soviet Union and all [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]] voters voted in favor, with the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmenia Republic]] showing the most support at 98% and the lowest in the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian Republic]] at 73%)<ref>[https://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&id=su011991 \"Sowjetunion, 17.

''Alternative Economic Models of Transition''. Aldershot; Burlington: Ashgate.</ref>\n\nAfter the [[20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], [[Mao Zedong]] condemned [[Stalinism]] and the flaws in the [[Marxist\u2013Leninist]] movement that peaked with the [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956]]. This gave Mao space in which to experiment with departure from the Soviet socialist economy. The Maoist economic model was reliant on ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' and ''Ten Great Relationships''. Mao modeled the Chinese socialist economy in such a way that it led to the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[People's commune|Commune Movement]]. In ''High Tide of Socialism in the Chinese Countryside'', Mao focused on the industrialization and mechanization of the countryside; in ''How to Handle Contradictions Among the People'' wrote about his thoughts on the problems of socialist states as well as the conflicts of interest in the Chinese socialist society; and in ''Ten Great Relationships'' wrote about his vision of China's economy.<ref>Nove, Alec; Nuti, D. M. (1972). ''Socialist Economics''. Harmondsworth: Penguin. pp. 491\u2013510.</ref>\n\nThe Maoist model had a dual economic goal, namely the industrialization of the countryside and the socialization of its people. It differed from the Soviet Union's goals in that Mao emphasized the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeoisie]] while the Soviet Union started advocating [[peaceful coexistence]]. China also allowed for more flexibility and experimentation than the Soviet Union and the countryside was at the center of its policies.<ref>Hoffmann, Charles (September 1971).

All in all, both supporters and critics alike generally agree that the human cost has been staggering.<ref name=\"Biography\"/>\n\n=== Systematic economic challenges ===\n{{see also|Soviet-type economic planning}}\nThe problem with the central planning of authoritarian socialist states is that as the state develops, it also grows in complexity and the possible errors grow and the possibilities of dis-allocations and waste of resources.<ref name=\"Wilczynski\"/> As commented by [[Karl Marx]], capitalism works because it is a system of economic force, but in socialist economics this force is insufficient to provide enough incentive. Human needs should be taken into account to make a socialist society function, but there is no necessary connection between the accumulation of capital and human satisfaction.<ref>Ollman, Berell; Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel (1998). ''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists''. New York: Routledge. pp. 60\u201362.</ref> Some of the issues that emerged during the socialist phase of Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union and Maoist China included:\n* Inflation: Yugoslavia raised its industrial prices by 17% and its agricultural prices by 32% from 1964 to 1965 while Czechoslovakia raised the prices of foodstuffs and services by 20% in 1966 and by 1967 prices were up by 30%.\n* Lagged consumption: there was a lag between when products were fabricated and when they were accessed to by the population, goods tended to stockpile. The production of consumer products also diminished and in Yugoslavia the share of consumer products fell from 70% before World War II to 31% in 1965.\n* Fixing prices: prices were fixed under the premise that it would force producers to behave more efficiently and as such the price-controlled products were produced in lower quantities. In Yugoslavia, the market distortion caused by the price fixing was realized and led to the un-freezing of prices in 1967. Hungary also had frozen prices and slowly unfroze them over a period of ten to fifteen years because otherwise the structural disproportions of the Hungarian economy would spin prices out of control.\n* Production structure: many factories were kept running through government subsidies and protection despite any economic losses of the factories. This decreased overall efficiency of the socialist economies and also increased the financial losses of those economies.\n* Disproportionality: there was a disproportionate amount of available jobs and manpower. As argued by Ljubo Sirc, the \"Soviet Union and other communist countries have the worst of both worlds: some enterprises or operations are inefficient because they are too capital-intensive, other enterprises or operations because they are too labour-intensive\".<ref name=\"Sirc\"/>\n\nThe [[Stalinist]] economic model in which the socialist economies were based did not allow for a decrease in growth rates. It did not allow for the flexibility needed to keep up with growing economies.<ref name=\"Marangos\"/> Despite these shortcomings, the Soviet Union's growth in GDP per capita compared favorably with Western Europe.<ref name=\"Maddison\"/> It has also been noted that such states compared favorably with Western states in some health indicators such as [[infant mortality]] and [[life expectancy]],<ref>Ellman, Michael (2014).

This development culminated in the empowerment of a [[proletariat]] which could benefit from the fruits of [[industrialization]] without being exploited. Although he meant his ideology to appeal to the disenfranchised working class of an industrialized society, it was widely accepted by developing countries that had yet to successfully industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> This resulted in stagnant economies and socialist states without the necessary organization and structure to industrialize.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Seeing the failure of those models, Lenin concluded that socialism in Russia had to be constructed from above through party dictatorship that appealed to both the working class and peasants.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Because the working class accounted for only 15% of the population, Lenin was forced to appeal to the much greater peasant class (accounting for nearly 80%) to propel the [[Bolshevik]] faction of [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] that under Lenin eventually became the [[Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] due to a split with [[social democracy]].<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The Bolsheviks promised \"Bread, Peace, and Land\" to the peasants and delivered, redistributing land from the landlords and increasing the number of farms in Russia from 427,000 in 1917 to 463,000 in 1919.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nFor some, Lenin's legacy was one of violent terror and concentration of power in the hands of few.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin intentionally employed violence as a means to manipulate the population and tolerated absolutely no opposition, arguing that it was \"a great deal better to 'discuss with rifles' than with the theses of the opposition\".<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> He worked for the ideological destruction of society as a whole so that it could easily adopt the rhetoric and political ideals of the ruling party.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> Lenin's use of terror (instilled by a secret police apparatus) to exact social obedience, mass murder and disappearance, censoring of communications and absence of justice was only reinforced by his successor [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> In contrast to those who support this thesis,<ref>Leggett, George (1981).

[https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1931/02/04.htm \"The Tasks of Business Executives\"].</ref> Acknowledging this inadequacy, Stalin ordered that resources slotted for consumption be redirected to production or exported as a temporary sacrifice on the part of the population for the sake of rapid growth.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> The model was successful initially, with ideology and nationalism promoting morale despite shortages in resources such as food and construction materials for housing. Presumably, the exploited classes believed that once the rapid and successful industrialization of Russia had taken place, power would be relinquished by the [[vanguard party]] and [[Communist society|communism]] would ensue.<ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> However, Stalin continued to demand even more far-reaching sacrifices. Because of his control over both political and economic arenas which historians argue gave his vanguard party an amount of control surpassing that of [[Russian tsar|Russia's tzars or emperors]], citizens were unwilling to challenge his decrees, given that aspects of their lives such as medical care, housing and social freedoms could be restricted according to the discretion of the party.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/>\n\nDespite failures, Stalin's expectations remained uncontested by the working class and the model was adopted by a multitude of emerging socialist states during that era. The Soviet attempt to [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivize agriculture]], transforming the Soviet Union from one of the world's largest exporters of grain to the world's largest importer of grain, was widely replicated despite its failure.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/> Many historians claim that extermination was the fate of a wide variety of people during Stalin's regime such as political opponents, ideological rivals, suspect party members, accused military officers, kulaks, lower-class families, former members of the societal elites, ethnic groups, religious groups and the relatives and sympathizers of these offenders.<ref name=\"From Leninism to Freedom\"/><ref name=\"The Case\"/><ref name=\"The Grand Failure\"/> These deaths occurred as a result of collectivization, famine, terror campaigns, disease, war and mortality rates in the Gulag. As the majority of excess deaths under Stalin were not direct killings, the exact number of victims of Stalinism is difficult to calculate due to lack of consensus among scholars on which deaths can be attributed to Stalin.<ref>Getty, J.

He described his ideal system as \"a political situation in which there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unity of purpose and personal ease of mind and liveliness to facilitate the socialist revolution\".<ref name=\"Fetzer\"/> While the system advocates contradiction, Mao believed the state above all could provide the masses with the tools for their own expression, but his own brand of self-expression was wholly manufactured, built largely on replacing [[Chinese culture|traditional practices and artifacts]] with his own. Through this, transformation of the people towards an internal party collectiveness was possible.<ref name=\"Fetzer\" />\n\nNotably, Mao's authoritarianism was rooted in a collective bottom-up style of empowerment.

His revision proved similar to that of [[Benito Mussolini]] as he called on a national movement from and for his one-party-ruled government, arguing: \"In a word, we must awaken the National Consciousness.

However, elite landowners questioned the legitimacy of Nkrumah's power. Those elites were only afforded one choice, namely to align with their government if they wanted access to the state.

Favreau was also attracted to Downey from his performance in ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'' (2005), with Downey frequently conversing with that film's director, [[Shane Black]], about the script and dialogue in ''Iron Man''.<ref name=\"KissKissBangBang\" />\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Early life===\nAnthony Edward \"Tony\" Stark was born on May 29, 1970, in [[Manhattan, New York]] to [[Howard Stark]], a famous genius inventor and businessman, and [[Maria Stark|Maria Stark (n\u00e9e Carbonell)]], a New York [[socialite]] and philanthropist. Growing up under the eye of family butler [[Edwin Jarvis]], his life was characterized by a cold and affectionless relationship with his father. Seeing that his son could achieve great things, Howard tried to inspire him with constant talks about his own role in the creation of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]]. This instead embittered Stark, who felt that his father was taking more pride in his creations than in his family. Stark proved to be a brilliant and unique [[child prodigy]], he attended [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] for two years starting at age 14.<ref name=\"Guidebook\" /> \n\nOn December 16, 1991, when Stark was 21, his parents went away to the [[Bahamas]], but planned to stop at the Pentagon to deliver [[supersoldier serum]] he had redeveloped. On their way there, both were killed in a car accident\u2014later revealed to be an assassination carried out by the [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Winter Soldier]] on behalf of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] to steal the serum.{{refn|name=CivilWar|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.}} As a result, Stark inherited his father's company, becoming CEO of Stark Industries. Over the years, he became well known as a weapons designer and inventor, and lived a [[playboy lifestyle]]. In 1999, he attended a conference in [[Bern]] where he met scientists [[Maya Hansen]], inventor of the [[Extremis]] experimental regenerative treatment, and [[Aldrich Killian]], rejecting an offer to work for Killian's [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]].{{refn|name=IM3|group=N|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.}}\n\n===Becoming Iron Man===\n{{See also|Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man 2}}\nIn the late 2000s, Stark travels to [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war-torn Afghanistan]] with his friend and [[Civil-Military Co-operation#Doctrine|military liaison]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Rhodes to demonstrate Stark's new \"Jericho\" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings. Fellow captive [[Ho Yinsen]], a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him.\n\nStark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a [[Iron Man's armor in other media|suit of powered armor]]. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor\n\nStark learns that Stane has been [[arms trafficking]] to criminals worldwide, and is staging a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in his new armor, flies to Afghanistan and saves the villagers. Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest, revealing that Stane was responsible for Stark's captivity. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it and defeats Stane. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being \"Iron Man.\"\n\nSix months later, Stark has become a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father's legacy, but discovers that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, he appoints Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries.\n\nStark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]] and is attacked mid-race by [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]], who wields electrified whips powered by a miniature arc reactor. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. At his birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the [[U.S. Air Force]].\n\nStark discovers a hidden message from his father, a diagram of the structure of a new element, which Stark synthesizes. At the Expo, Stark's rival [[Justin Hammer]] unveils Vanko's armored drones he had him make, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones.\n\n===The Battle of New York and aftermath===\n{{See also|The Avengers (2012 film)|Iron Man 3}}\nWhen the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] arrives and begins menacing Earth, seizing the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]] from a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, Fury activates the Avengers Initiative and  S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] visits Stark to have him review the research of [[Erik Selvig]] on the Tesseract. In [[Stuttgart]], Rogers and Loki fight briefly until Tony Stark appears in his [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Film|Iron Man armor]], resulting in Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]].\n\nThe Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons. Agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight, which Stark and Rogers must work to restart. Loki escapes, and Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract to open a wormhole in [[New York City]] above [[Stark Tower]] to allow the Chitauri fleet in space to invade. Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Stark intercepts the missile, and in an apparent sacrifice of his own life, takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground.\n\nStark develops [[PTSD]] from his experiences during the alien invasion, resulting in panic attacks. Restless, he builds several dozen Iron Man suits, creating friction with girlfriend Pepper Potts. When [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] is badly injured in one of a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], Stark issues a televised threat to him, who destroys Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit and crashes in rural Tennessee. His experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.\n\nStark traces the Mandarin to Miami and infiltrates his headquarters, where he discovers the Mandarin was just an actor. [[Aldrich Killian]] reveals himself to be the real Mandarin and captures Stark. He escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard [[Air Force One]]. Stark saves the surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. Killian intends to kill Ellis on an oil platform on live television. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts \u2013 who had been kidnapped and subjected to [[Extremis]] \u2013, as Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Potts, having survived the Extremis procedure, kills Killian. Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy all of the Iron Man suits as a sign of his devotion to Potts, and undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. He pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, musing that he will always be Iron Man.\n\n===Battle of Sokovia and Civil War===\n{{See also|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Captain America: Civil War|Spider-Man: Homecoming}}\nStark and the Avengers raid a Hydra facility commanded by Baron [[Baron Strucker|Wolfgang von Strucker]], who has been experimenting on siblings [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. While the team fights outside, Stark enters the lab and finds the scepter, along with [[Chitauri]] ships from the Battle of New York and androids under construction. Wanda sneaks up behind him and uses her mind manipulation powers to give him a haunting vision: the death of all the Avengers except him. Stark awakens from the vision and grabs Loki's scepter.\n\nReturning to Stark Tower, Stark and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] discover an [[artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's \"[[Ultron]]\" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron eliminates Stark's A.I. [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] and attacks the Avengers at Stark Tower. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron builds an army of robot drones, kills Strucker and recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons. The Avengers find and attack Ultron, but Wanda subdues most of the team with personalized, disturbing visions, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.\n\nAfter hiding at a safe house, Nick Fury arrives and encourages Stark and the others to form a plan to stop Ultron, who is discovered to have forced the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to perfect a new body for him. Rogers, Romanoff, and [[Clint Barton]] find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff. Returning to their headquarters in New York, the Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark and Banner secretly upload J.A.R.V.I.S.\u2014who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet\u2014into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow was part of his vision. This \"[[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]\" and the Maximoffs, now on their side, accompany Stark and the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. One of Ultron's drones is able to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. The Avengers establish a new base, and Stark leaves the team in the hands of Rogers and Romanoff.\n\nApproximately one year later, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]] informs the Avengers that the [[United Nations]] (UN) is preparing to pass the [[Sokovia Accords]], which will establish UN oversight of the team. The Avengers are divided: Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of a government. Circumstances lead to Rogers and fellow super-soldier [[Bucky Barnes]]\u2014framed for a terrorist attack\u2014going rogue, along with [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], Wanda Maximoff, Barton, and [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]]. Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, [[T'Challa]], Rhodes, Vision, and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] to capture the renegades at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]]. However, during the battle, Rogers and Barnes are able to escape. Stark learns that Barnes was framed and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes. They find that the other supersoldiers have been killed by [[Helmut Zemo]], who plays footage that reveals that Barnes killed Stark's parents. Stark turns on them, dismembering Barnes' robotic arm. After an intense fight, Rogers finally manages to disable Stark's Iron Man armor and departs with Barnes, leaving [[Captain America's shield|his shield]] behind. Stark returns to New York to work on exoskeletal leg braces to allow Rhodes to walk again. Steve Rogers sends a flip phone to Stark, his former ally and friend, to keep in contact. When Ross calls informing him that Barton and the others have escaped, Stark refuses to help.\n\nPeter Parker resumes his high school studies when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger. Stark rescues Parker from nearly drowning after an encounter with [[Adrian Toomes]]. Stark warns Parker against further involvement with the criminals. Another weapon from Toomes malfunctions during a fight with Parker and tears the [[Staten Island Ferry]] in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers before admonishing him for his recklessness and confiscating his suit. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from Stark Tower to the team's new headquarters. After Parker thwarts the plan and saves Toomes from an explosion, Stark admits he was wrong about Parker and invites him to become an Avenger full-time, but Parker declines. Potts emerges from a packed press conference, called to make the announcement, and Stark decides to use the opportunity to instead propose to Potts. At the end of the film, he returns the suit to Peter.\n\n===The Infinity War===\n{{See also|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame}}\nStark and Potts are in a New York City park discussing having children, when Banner, who had disappeared after the Battle of Sokovia, crash-lands at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]]. Banner relays a warning to [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]], [[Wong (comics)|Wong]], and Stark that the mad Titan [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] plans to use the [[Infinity Gems#Film|Infinity Stones]] to kill half of all life in the universe. [[Ebony Maw]] and [[Black Dwarf (comics)|Cull Obsidian]] arrive to retrieve the Time Stone, prompting Strange, Stark, Wong, and Parker to confront them. Although Cull Obsidian is incapacitated and thrown into Antarctica, Strange is captured by Maw. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship to rescue him.\n\nAfter successfully freeing Strange and killing Maw, the trio proceed to Thanos\u2019 home planet [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]], where they meet members of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]]. They form a plan to confront Thanos and remove the Infinity Gauntlet, but Thanos overpowers the group and stabs Stark. Strange surrenders the Time Stone in exchange for Thanos sparing Stark. Thanos takes the stone and departs Titan for Earth, retrieves the final stone, and activates the Infinity Gauntlet. Stark and [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], stranded on Titan, watch as Parker and others are turned to dust.\n\nStark and Nebula are adrift in space before being rescued by [[Carol Danvers]] and returned to Earth, where Stark chooses to retire and raise his daughter [[Morgan Stark|Morgan]] over the next five years. In 2023, when [[Scott Lang]] discovers a way to bring back the fallen, the Avengers approach Stark, who initially refuses, considering the idea dangerously hypothetical. Despite this, he examines the matter privately and figures out how to do it successfully and agrees to help. Traveling through time, Stark fails to retrieve the Space Stone following the Battle of New York, and instead goes further back to the 1970s to steal it from a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where he has a moving conversation with a younger version of his father, Howard Stark.\n\nThe Avengers successfully obtain all of the Infinity Stones before returning to the present, which are incorporated into a gauntlet made by Stark which Banner then uses to resurrect those that were disintegrated by Thanos. However, they are followed by a 2014 version of Thanos and his forces, who are summoned to 2023 by an alternate version of [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]. During an ensuing battle, Thanos obtains Stark's gauntlet and the two of them wrestle for control of it. Thanos is able to fling Stark away before attempting another snap, but discovers that Stark has caused all of the Infinity Stones to move to Stark's own armor. Stark then uses them to disintegrate Thanos and all of his forces, saving the universe but fatally injuring himself in the process. He dies surrounded by Rhodes, Parker, and Potts. A funeral attended by many heroes is later held for him at his homestead.\n\nEight months later, the world continues to mourn Stark. Parker receives glasses that can access Stark's artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H., with a message that establishes him as Stark's successor.{{refn|name=FFH|group=N|As depicted in the 2019 film ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''.}}\n\n==Film appearances==\nRobert Downey Jr. portrays Tony Stark in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''Iron Man'' (2008),<ref name=\"DowneyCastIM\" /> ''Iron Man 2'' (2010),<ref name=\"RDJAugust2008\" /> ''The Avengers'' (2012),<ref name=\"DowneyCastAvengers\" /> ''Iron Man 3'' (2013),<ref name=\"DowneyAug2011\" /> ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' (2015),<ref name=\"DowneyAvengers2&3\" /> ''Captain America: Civil War'' (2016),<ref name=\"DowneyVariety2014\" /> ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' (2017),<ref name=\"KitTHR2016\" /> ''Avengers: Infinity War'' (2018),<ref name=\"DowneyAvengers2&3\" /> and ''Avengers: Endgame'' (2019).<ref name=\"DowneyVariety2014\" /> In addition, Downey makes an uncredited cameo appearance in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"DowneyTIH\" /> He will reprise the role in ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020).<ref name=\"DowneyBW\" />\n\n===References in other films===\n* In ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), Fury mentions that Stark help design the turbines for the new Helicarriers, after getting \"a closer look\" at them in ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"StarkTWS\" />\n* In ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), the Quinjet's authentication for Thor is \"[[Point Break]]\", in reference to Stark's nickname for him.

He appears in archival footage from ''Captain America: Civil War'', he's mentioned in a memorial for heroes who died fighting Thanos, appears in murals and has a documentary dedicated to him. [[AC/DC]]'s song \"[[Back in Black]]\" from ''Iron Man 2'' makes an appearance.<ref name=\"StarkFFH\" />\n\n===Other media===\nStark is shown via archive footage in the [[Marvel One-Shot]] ''[[The Consultant (film)|The Consultant]]'' (2011).<ref name=\"IGNConsultant\" />\n\n==Characterization==\n===Appearance and personality===\nDowney had an office next to Favreau during pre-production, which allowed him greater involvement in the screenwriting process,<ref name=\"EmpireJuly2007\" /> especially adding humor to the film.<ref name=\"EmpireApril2008\" /> Downey explained, \"What I usually hate about these [superhero] movies [is] when suddenly the guy that you were digging turns into [[Dudley Do-Right]], and then you're supposed to buy into all his 'Let's go do some good!' That [[Eliot Ness]]-in-a-cape-type thing. What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that he's unrecognizable. When someone used to be a schmuck and they're not anymore, hopefully they still have a sense of humor.\"<ref name=\"FavreauStarkQuote\" /> To prepare, Downey spent five days a week [[weight training]] and practiced martial arts to get into shape,<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> which he said benefited him because \"it's hard not to have a personality meltdown [...] after about several hours in that suit. I'm calling up every therapeutic moment I can think of to just get through the day.\"<ref name=\"PumpingIron\" />\n\nIn ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', Stark struggles to keep his technology out of the government's hands. Downey and Favreau, who had been handed a script and worked from it on the first movie, conceived of the film's story themselves.<ref name=\"RDJAugust2008\" /> On Stark being a hero, Downey said \"It's kind of heroic, but really kind of on his own behalf. So I think there's probably a bit of an imposter complex and no sooner has he said, 'I am Iron Man &ndash;' that he's now really wondering what that means. If you have all this cushion like he does and the public is on your side and you have immense wealth and power, I think he's way too insulated to be okay.\"<ref name=\"DowneyComicCon\" />\n\n''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' introduced Stark's role as one of an ensemble of heroes who must come together to defend the Earth from an alien invasion led by the god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]. Downey initially pushed director [[Joss Whedon]] to make Stark the lead of the 2012 ''Avengers'' film: \"Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus.\"<ref name=\"BreznicanEW2011\" /> About the character's evolution from previous films, Downey said, \"In ''Iron Man'', which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. ''Iron Man 2'' is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . In ''The Avengers'', he's throwing it down with the others\".<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> At the climax of the film, Stark guides a nuclear missile through an interstellar portal to destroy the main alien vessel, demonstrating a willingness to sacrifice his life to save the Earth.<ref name=\"MCUJourneySR\" />\n\n[[File:Robert Downey Jr at Comic Con 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Downey Jr. at Comic Con 2007, after being cast in ''Iron Man''.]]\nIn ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', Stark struggles to come to terms with his near-death experience in ''The Avengers'',<ref name=\"StarkMCUProfile\" /> suffering from anxiety attacks. On making a third ''Iron Man'' film, Downey said, \"My sense of it is that we need to leave it all on the field\u2014whatever that means in the end. You can pick several different points of departure for that.\"<ref name=\"DowneyAug2011\" /> On following up ''The Avengers'', Downey said they \"tried to be practical, in a post-''Avengers'' world. What are his challenges now?  What are some limitations that might be placed on him? And what sort of threat would have him, as usual, ignore those limitations?\"<ref name=\"ComicCon12Interview\" /> Screenwriter Drew Pearce compared Stark in ''Iron Man 3'' to an American [[James Bond (character)|James Bond]] for both being \"heroes with a sense of danger to them, and unpredictability\" even if Stark was a \"free agent\" instead of an authority figure like Bond. He also likened Tony to the protagonists of 1970s films such as ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' (1971), where \"the idiosyncrasies of the heroes is what made them exciting.\"<ref name=\"PearceWhatCulture\" />\n\nIn ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', Stark has become the [[Benefactor (law)|benefactor]] of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref name=\"WiglerMTV\" /><ref name=\"FeigeIGN2014\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpy2015\" /> On how his character evolves after the events of ''Iron Man 3'', Downey said, \"I think he realizes that tweaking and making all the suits in the world\u2014which is what he has been doing\u2014still didn't work for that thing of his tour of duty that left him a little [[PTSD]]. So his focus is more on how can we make it so that there's no problem to begin with. That, you know, there's a bouncer at our planet's rope. That's the big idea.\"<ref name=\"DowneySR2014\" /> The events of ''Age of Ultron'' lead directly into the conflict of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'', in which Stark leads a faction of Avengers in support of the regulation of individuals with superpowers, and is the main antagonist of the film;<ref name=\"VarietyAug2015\" /><ref name=\"FandangoMarch2016\" />  Anthony Russo said that Stark's egomania allowed the writers \"to bring him to a point in his life where he was willing to submit to an authority, where he felt it was the right thing to do.\" Joe Russo added that because of the visions Stark saw in ''Age of Ultron'', he now has a guilt complex which \"drives him to make very specific decisions\", calling his emotional arc \"very complicated\".<ref name=\"RussosEmpire2015\" /> Downey's personal trainer Eric Oram stated that the trick to pitting Rogers against Stark, \"is to show Iron Man using the 'minimum force' necessary to win the fight\".<ref name=\"DowneyTrainer\" /> Marvel initially wanted Downey's part to be smaller, but \"Downey wanted Stark to have a more substantial role in the film's plot.\" ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' noted that Downey would receive $40 million-plus backend for his participation, as well as an additional payout if the film outperformed ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', as Marvel would attribute that success to Downey's presence.<ref name=\"DowneyVariety2014\" />\n\nIn ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', Stark is [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Marvel Cinematic Universe|Peter Parker]]'s mentor and is the creator of the U.S. Department of [[Damage Control (comics)|Damage Control]].<ref name=\"KitTHR2016\" /><ref name=\"FilmSetVisitPg2\" /> [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group]] chairman [[Thomas Rothman]] noted that, beyond the commercial advantage of featuring Downey in the film, the inclusion of Stark was important due to the relationship established between him and Parker in ''Captain America: Civil War''.<ref name=\"RothmanDowney2016\" /> Watts noted that after Stark's actions in ''Civil War'', introducing Parker to life as an Avenger, there are \"a lot of repercussions to that. Is it a first step towards Tony as some sort of mentor figure?

The back is less armored than the front, because Stark would use his resources for a forward attack. It also foreshadows the design of Stane's armor. A single {{convert|90|lb|adj=on}} version was built, causing concern when a stuntman fell over inside it, though both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed. The armor was also designed to only have its top half worn at times.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Stan Winston Studios built a {{convert|10|ft|adj=on}}, {{convert|800|lb|adj=on}} animatronic version of \"Iron Monger\",<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a [[gimbal]] to simulate walking.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> A [[scale model]] was used for the shots of it being built.<ref name=\"FavreauSHH\" /> The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps.<ref name=\"FavreauSHH\" />\n\nIron Man comic book artist [[Adi Granov]] designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders.<ref name=\"GranovSaunders\" /> Granov's designs were the primary inspiration for the film's, and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreau's MySpace page.<ref name=\"FavreauAICN2\" /> Saunders streamlined Granov's concept art, making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> and also designed the [[War Machine]] armor, but it was \"cut from the script about halfway through pre-production.\" He explained that the War Machine armor \"was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor,\" and that it \"would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence.\"<ref name=\"WarMachine\" /> Concerned with the transition between the computer-generated and practical costumes, Favreau hired [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) to create the bulk of the visual effects for the film after seeing ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' and ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]''.<ref name=\"FavreauEffectsConcerns\" /> [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]] and [[The Embassy Visual Effects|The Embassy]] did additional work.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />  To help with animating the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey wear only the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a [[motion capture]] suit.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\nFor ''Iron Man 2'', ILM again did the majority of the effects, as it did on the first film.<ref name=\"ILMBenSnow\" /> ILM's visual effects supervisor on the film, [[Ben Snow]], said their work on the film was \"harder\" than their work on the first, stating that Favreau asked more of them this time around. Snow described the process of digitally creating the suits:\n{{quote|text=On the first ''Iron Man'', we tried to use the Legacy [Studios, [[Stan Winston]]'s effects company] and Stan Winston suits as much as we could. For the second one, Jon [Favreau] was confident we could create the [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] suits, and the action dictated using them. So, Legacy created what we called the \"football suits\" from the torso up with a chest plate and helmet. We'd usually put in some arm pieces, but not the whole arm. In the house fight sequence, where Robert Downey Jr. staggers around tipsy, we used some of the practical suit and extended it digitally. Same thing in the [[Randy's Donuts]] scene. But in the rest of the film, we used the CG suit entirely. And [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] did an all-digital suit for the Monaco chase.<ref name=\"ILMBenSnow\" />}}\n\nIn the filming of ''The Avengers'', [[Weta Digital]] took over duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We shared assets back and forth with ILM, but our pipelines are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different.\"<ref name=\"AWN\" /> Williams said the most difficult part was re-creating Iron Man's reflective metal surfaces.<ref name=\"Fxguide\" />\n\nFor ''Iron Man 3'', [[Digital Domain]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Trixter each worked on separate shots featuring the Mark 42 armor, working with different digital models. The studios shared some of their files to ensure consistency between the shots. For the Mark 42 and Iron Patriot armors, [[Legacy Effects]] constructed partial suits that were worn on set. Townsend explained that \"Invariably we'd shoot a soft-suit with Robert then we'd also put [[motion capture|tracking markers]] on his trousers. He would also wear lifts in his shoes or be up in a box so he'd be the correct height\u2014Iron Man is 6'5\". During shooting we used multiple witness cams, [[Canon EOS C300|Canon C300s]], and we had two or three running whenever there was an Iron Man or Extremis character.\"<ref name=\"Fxguide2\" /> The heads-up display features of the helmet were inspired by visualization techniques from MRI diagnostic pattern recognition and graph theory, particularly by the [[connectogram]], a circular graph that maps all of the white-matter connections of the human brain.<ref name=\"BarbasMRI\" />\n\n==Differences from the comics==\nThe origin story of Iron Man has been updated for the films. In the comics, Stark becomes Iron Man following an experience in the [[Vietnam War]], which is changed to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"EraoSR\" /> [[Edwin Jarvis|Jarvis]], in the comics, is the family butler, while in the films [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] is an artificial intelligence created by Stark,<ref name=\"HowardCB\" /> though still inspired by the butler from Stark's childhood who is revealed to have passed away by the time the first film takes place.<ref name=\"EraoSR\" /> Stark also proceeds through the early iterations of his armor to reach the now-familiar red and gold color scheme much more quickly. Stark's personality more closely resembles the Ultimate Comics version.<ref name=\"EraoSR\" />\n\nThe AI version of J.A.R.V.I.S. is eventually uploaded by Stark to an artificial body and becomes [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. In the films, Vision is created by Stark and Banner as a counter to Ultron. In the comics, however, Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers, [[Hank Pym]], and aspects of Pym's personality are integrated into this version of Stark, such as a desire for peace.<ref name=\"BrowneSR\" /> Another difference in the films is the romance between Stark and Pepper Potts. In the comics, Potts has unrequited feelings for Stark, and ultimately becomes involved with Stark's chauffeur and bodyguard, Happy Hogan.<ref name=\"HowardCB\" /><ref name=\"BrowneSR\" />\n\nA new approach not seen in comics is Stark's mentorial relationship with [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]]. In the [[Ultimate Comics]], Stark and Parker do not go past the normal trainer-trainee relationship. In the MCU, Stark is also the creator of multiple iterations of Parker's Spider-Man suits, unlike in the comics where he only creates the [[Iron Spider|Iron Spider Armor]], while Parker creates other suits by himself.<ref name=\"McMillanWired\" /> Stark is also shown to have a history with Parker's foes [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and [[Mysterio (comics)|Mysterio]]; both are depicted as having turned into villains after due to actions by Stark. While he does not end up facing them, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 does.<ref name=\"VultureSR\" /><ref name=\"MysterioPS\" />\n\nThe Mandarin, a recurring Iron Man villain in the comics, turns out to be just an actor portraying the character, with the real criminal mastermind behind the acts claimed by \"the Mandarin\" being [[Aldrich Killian]]\u2014a minor character in the comics.<ref name=\"BrowneSR\" /><ref name=\"MandarinMTV\" /> The Mandarin is revealed to be a real person in the Marvel One-Shot ''[[All Hail the King]]'',<ref name=\"MandarinSR\" /> this version will instead by portrayed as an enemy of [[Shang-Chi]] in ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'' (2021).<ref name=\"MandarinShangChi\" />\n\n==Reception==\nDowney's portrayal of the character has been positively received by fans and critics. [[Roger Ebert]] praised Downey's performance in ''Iron Man'', stating \"At the end of the day it's Robert Downey Jr. who powers the lift-off separating this from most other superhero movies\".<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'', a one-time Marvel Comics writer, commended that ''Iron Man 2'' \"doesn't find a changed man. Inside the metal, imperfect humanity grows even more so, as thought-provoking questions of identity meet techno-fantasy made flesh\".<ref name=\"FrankLoveceReview\" />\n\nFor ''The Avengers'', Joe Morgenstern of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''\u2014despite complimenting Downey's performance\u2014favored his work in ''Iron Man'' over his acting in ''The Avengers'': \"His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication\u2014the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world\u2014and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony\".<ref name=\"MorgensternAvengers\" /> In his review of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Morgenstern lauded both actor and character, praising \"Robert Downey Jr.'s startlingly smart Tony Stark\" who, along with Chris Evans' Captain America and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, contributed to that film's \"feeling of family ... because the debuts of its most prominent members remain vivid to this day.\"<ref name=\"MorgensternEndgame\" />\n\nIn 2015, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' named Tony Stark the 13th greatest film character of all time.<ref name=\"EmpireGreatest\" /> In 2019, following Stark's death in ''Avengers: Endgame'', a statute representing the character in his was Iron Man armor was erected in [[Forte dei Marmi]], Italy.<ref name=\"ItalyStatue\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\nDowney has received numerous nominations and awards for his portrayal of Tony Stark. He notably won the [[Saturn Award for Best Actor]] three times,<ref name=\"2009SaturnAwards\" /><ref name=\"2014SaturnAwards\" /><ref name=\"2019SaturnAwards\" /> making him a record four-time winner (he had previously won the award for 1993's ''[[Heart and Souls]]'');<ref name=\"1994SaturnAwards\" /> it is also the record for most wins for portraying the same character, tied with [[Mark Hamill]] for playing [[Luke Skywalker]].<ref name=\"HamillSaturn\" /><ref name=\"HamillSaturn2\" /><ref name=\"HamillSaturn3\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Iron Man|character of the same name]]\u2014commonly known by his [[alter ego]], '''Iron Man'''. In the films, Stark is an industrialist, genius inventor, hero and former playboy who is CEO of [[Stark Industries]]. At the beginning of the series, he is a chief weapons manufacturer for the [[U.S. military]], until he has a change of heart and redirects his technical knowledge into the creation of mechanized suits of armor which he uses to defend against those that would threaten peace around the world.\n\nStark has been one of the central figures of the MCU, having appeared in eleven films since his introduction in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008). The character and Downey's performance have been credited with helping to cement the MCU as a multi-billion dollar franchise, with Stark's evolution often being considered the defining arc of the series.<ref name=\"BusinessInsider\" />\n\n==Concept and creation==\nTony Stark first premiered as a comic book character, in ''[[Tales of Suspense]]'' #39 ([[cover date]]d March 1963), a collaboration among editor and story-plotter [[Stan Lee]], scripter [[Larry Lieber]], story-artist [[Don Heck]], and cover-artist and character-designer [[Jack Kirby]].<ref name=\"DeFalco\" /> Lee wanted to create the \"quintessential capitalist\", a character that would go against the spirit of the times and Marvel's readership.<ref name=\"Excelsior160\" /> Lee based this playboy's looks and personality on [[Howard Hughes]],<ref name=\"MaskGameInformer\" /> as \"one of the most colorful men of our time. He was an inventor, an adventurer, a multi-billionaire, a ladies' man and finally a nutcase.\"<ref name=\"Soapbox\" /> The character's original costume was a bulky gray armored suit, replaced by a golden version in the second story (issue #40, April 1963), and redesigned as sleeker, red-and-golden armor in issue #48 (Dec. 1963) by [[Steve Ditko]].<ref name=\"SigningSession\" /> Lee and Kirby included Iron Man in ''[[The Avengers (comic book)|The Avengers]]'' #1 (Sept. 1963) as a founding member of the superhero team. In the mid-2000s, with a number of movies having been made from other Marvel properties licensed to other studios, [[Kevin Feige]] realized that Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], which included Iron Man. Feige, a self-professed \"fanboy\", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.<ref name=\"BostonApril2012\" />\n\n[[Jon Favreau]], who was selected to direct the first ''Iron Man'' film, felt Downey's past made him an appropriate choice for the part,<ref name=\"DowneyUSAToday\" /> and that the actor could make Stark a \"likable asshole,\" but also depict an authentic emotional journey once he won over the audience.<ref name=\"FavreauWonderCon2008\" />\n\nUltimately though, Downey ended up being the choice the studio made for the first character in their ever-expansive cinematic universe. Favreau was also attracted to Downey from his performance in ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'' (2005), with Downey frequently conversing with that film's director, [[Shane Black]], about the script and dialogue in ''Iron Man''.<ref name=\"KissKissBangBang\" />\n\n==Fictional character biography==\n===Early life===\nAnthony Edward \"Tony\" Stark was born on May 29, 1970, in [[Manhattan, New York]] to [[Howard Stark]], a famous genius inventor and businessman, and [[Maria Stark|Maria Stark (n\u00e9e Carbonell)]], a New York [[socialite]] and philanthropist. Growing up under the eye of family butler [[Edwin Jarvis]], his life was characterized by a cold and affectionless relationship with his father. Seeing that his son could achieve great things, Howard tried to inspire him with constant talks about his own role in the creation of [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]]. This instead embittered Stark, who felt that his father was taking more pride in his creations than in his family. Stark proved to be a brilliant and unique [[child prodigy]], he attended [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] for two years starting at age 14.<ref name=\"Guidebook\" /> \n\nOn December 16, 1991, when Stark was 21, his parents went away to the [[Bahamas]], but planned to stop at the Pentagon to deliver [[supersoldier serum]] he had redeveloped. On their way there, both were killed in a car accident\u2014later revealed to be an assassination carried out by the [[Bucky Barnes (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Winter Soldier]] on behalf of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] to steal the serum.{{refn|name=CivilWar|group=N|As depicted in the 2016 film ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.}} As a result, Stark inherited his father's company, becoming CEO of Stark Industries. Over the years, he became well known as a weapons designer and inventor, and lived a [[playboy lifestyle]]. In 1999, he attended a conference in [[Bern]] where he met scientists [[Maya Hansen]], inventor of the [[Extremis]] experimental regenerative treatment, and [[Aldrich Killian]], rejecting an offer to work for Killian's [[Advanced Idea Mechanics]].{{refn|name=IM3|group=N|As depicted in the 2013 film ''[[Iron Man 3]]''.}}\n\n===Becoming Iron Man===\n{{See also|Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man 2}}\nIn the late 2000s, Stark travels to [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|war-torn Afghanistan]] with his friend and [[Civil-Military Co-operation#Doctrine|military liaison]] [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Rhodes to demonstrate Stark's new \"Jericho\" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings. Fellow captive [[Ho Yinsen]], a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him.\n\nStark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a [[Iron Man's armor in other media|suit of powered armor]]. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor\n\nStark learns that Stane has been [[arms trafficking]] to criminals worldwide, and is staging a [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]] to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark, in his new armor, flies to Afghanistan and saves the villagers. Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest, revealing that Stane was responsible for Stark's captivity. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it and defeats Stane. The next day, at a press conference, Stark publicly admits to being \"Iron Man.\"\n\nSix months later, Stark has become a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father's legacy, but discovers that the [[palladium]] core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, he appoints Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries.\n\nStark competes in the [[Historic Grand Prix of Monaco|Monaco Historic Grand Prix]] and is attacked mid-race by [[Whiplash (comics)|Ivan Vanko]], who wields electrified whips powered by a miniature arc reactor. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. At his birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the [[U.S. Air Force]].\n\nStark discovers a hidden message from his father, a diagram of the structure of a new element, which Stark synthesizes. At the Expo, Stark's rival [[Justin Hammer]] unveils Vanko's armored drones he had him make, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones.\n\n===The Battle of New York and aftermath===\n{{See also|The Avengers (2012 film)|Iron Man 3}}\nWhen the [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] [[Loki (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Loki]] arrives and begins menacing Earth, seizing the [[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]] from a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, Fury activates the Avengers Initiative and  S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent [[Phil Coulson]] visits Stark to have him review the research of [[Erik Selvig]] on the Tesseract. In [[Stuttgart]], Rogers and Loki fight briefly until Tony Stark appears in his [[Iron Man's armor in other media#Film|Iron Man armor]], resulting in Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the [[Helicarrier]].\n\nThe Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons. Agents possessed by Loki attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight, which Stark and Rogers must work to restart. Loki escapes, and Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract to open a wormhole in [[New York City]] above [[Stark Tower]] to allow the Chitauri fleet in space to invade. Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at [[Midtown Manhattan]]. Stark intercepts the missile, and in an apparent sacrifice of his own life, takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground.\n\nStark develops [[PTSD]] from his experiences during the alien invasion, resulting in panic attacks. Restless, he builds several dozen Iron Man suits, creating friction with girlfriend Pepper Potts. When [[Happy Hogan (comics)|Happy Hogan]] is badly injured in one of a string of bombings by a terrorist known only as the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]], Stark issues a televised threat to him, who destroys Stark's home with helicopter gunships. Stark escapes in an Iron Man suit and crashes in rural Tennessee. His experimental armor lacks sufficient power to return to California, and the world believes him dead.\n\nStark traces the Mandarin to Miami and infiltrates his headquarters, where he discovers the Mandarin was just an actor. [[Aldrich Killian]] reveals himself to be the real Mandarin and captures Stark. He escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard [[Air Force One]]. Stark saves the surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. Killian intends to kill Ellis on an oil platform on live television. On the platform, Stark goes to save Potts \u2013 who had been kidnapped and subjected to [[Extremis]] \u2013, as Rhodes saves the president. Stark summons his Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Potts, having survived the Extremis procedure, kills Killian. Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy all of the Iron Man suits as a sign of his devotion to Potts, and undergoes surgery to remove the shrapnel embedded near his heart. He pitches his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea, musing that he will always be Iron Man.\n\n===Battle of Sokovia and Civil War===\n{{See also|Avengers: Age of Ultron|Captain America: Civil War|Spider-Man: Homecoming}}\nStark and the Avengers raid a Hydra facility commanded by Baron [[Baron Strucker|Wolfgang von Strucker]], who has been experimenting on siblings [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]] using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. While the team fights outside, Stark enters the lab and finds the scepter, along with [[Chitauri]] ships from the Battle of New York and androids under construction. Wanda sneaks up behind him and uses her mind manipulation powers to give him a haunting vision: the death of all the Avengers except him. Stark awakens from the vision and grabs Loki's scepter.\n\nReturning to Stark Tower, Stark and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] discover an [[artificial intelligence]] within the scepter's gem, and secretly decide to use it to complete Stark's \"[[Ultron]]\" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron eliminates Stark's A.I. [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] and attacks the Avengers at Stark Tower. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron builds an army of robot drones, kills Strucker and recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons. The Avengers find and attack Ultron, but Wanda subdues most of the team with personalized, disturbing visions, causing Banner to transform into the Hulk and rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.\n\nAfter hiding at a safe house, Nick Fury arrives and encourages Stark and the others to form a plan to stop Ultron, who is discovered to have forced the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to perfect a new body for him. Rogers, Romanoff, and [[Clint Barton]] find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff. Returning to their headquarters in New York, the Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark and Banner secretly upload J.A.R.V.I.S.\u2014who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet\u2014into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow was part of his vision. This \"[[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]\" and the Maximoffs, now on their side, accompany Stark and the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. One of Ultron's drones is able to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. The Avengers establish a new base, and Stark leaves the team in the hands of Rogers and Romanoff.\n\nApproximately one year later, [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Thunderbolt Ross|Thaddeus Ross]] informs the Avengers that the [[United Nations]] (UN) is preparing to pass the [[Sokovia Accords]], which will establish UN oversight of the team. The Avengers are divided: Stark supports oversight because of his role in Ultron's creation and Sokovia's devastation, while Rogers has more faith in his own judgment than that of a government. Circumstances lead to Rogers and fellow super-soldier [[Bucky Barnes]]\u2014framed for a terrorist attack\u2014going rogue, along with [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]], Wanda Maximoff, Barton, and [[Scott Lang (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Scott Lang]]. Stark assembles a team composed of Romanoff, [[T'Challa]], Rhodes, Vision, and [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]] to capture the renegades at [[Leipzig/Halle Airport]]. However, during the battle, Rogers and Barnes are able to escape. Stark learns that Barnes was framed and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes. They find that the other supersoldiers have been killed by [[Helmut Zemo]], who plays footage that reveals that Barnes killed Stark's parents. Stark turns on them, dismembering Barnes' robotic arm. After an intense fight, Rogers finally manages to disable Stark's Iron Man armor and departs with Barnes, leaving [[Captain America's shield|his shield]] behind. Stark returns to New York to work on exoskeletal leg braces to allow Rhodes to walk again. Steve Rogers sends a flip phone to Stark, his former ally and friend, to keep in contact. When Ross calls informing him that Barton and the others have escaped, Stark refuses to help.\n\nPeter Parker resumes his high school studies when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger. Stark rescues Parker from nearly drowning after an encounter with [[Adrian Toomes]]. Stark warns Parker against further involvement with the criminals. Another weapon from Toomes malfunctions during a fight with Parker and tears the [[Staten Island Ferry]] in half. Stark helps Parker save the passengers before admonishing him for his recklessness and confiscating his suit. Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from Stark Tower to the team's new headquarters. After Parker thwarts the plan and saves Toomes from an explosion, Stark admits he was wrong about Parker and invites him to become an Avenger full-time, but Parker declines. Potts emerges from a packed press conference, called to make the announcement, and Stark decides to use the opportunity to instead propose to Potts. At the end of the film, he returns the suit to Peter.\n\n===The Infinity War===\n{{See also|Avengers: Infinity War|Avengers: Endgame}}\nStark and Potts are in a New York City park discussing having children, when Banner, who had disappeared after the Battle of Sokovia, crash-lands at the [[Sanctum Sanctorum]]. Banner relays a warning to [[Doctor Strange|Stephen Strange]], [[Wong (comics)|Wong]], and Stark that the mad Titan [[Thanos (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thanos]] plans to use the [[Infinity Gems#Film|Infinity Stones]] to kill half of all life in the universe. [[Ebony Maw]] and [[Black Dwarf (comics)|Cull Obsidian]] arrive to retrieve the Time Stone, prompting Strange, Stark, Wong, and Parker to confront them. Although Cull Obsidian is incapacitated and thrown into Antarctica, Strange is captured by Maw. Stark and Parker sneak aboard Maw's spaceship to rescue him.\n\nAfter successfully freeing Strange and killing Maw, the trio proceed to Thanos\u2019 home planet [[Titan (Marvel Comics location)|Titan]], where they meet members of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy]]. They form a plan to confront Thanos and remove the Infinity Gauntlet, but Thanos overpowers the group and stabs Stark. Strange surrenders the Time Stone in exchange for Thanos sparing Stark. Thanos takes the stone and departs Titan for Earth, retrieves the final stone, and activates the Infinity Gauntlet. Stark and [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]], stranded on Titan, watch as Parker and others are turned to dust.\n\nStark and Nebula are adrift in space before being rescued by [[Carol Danvers]] and returned to Earth, where Stark chooses to retire and raise his daughter [[Morgan Stark|Morgan]] over the next five years. In 2023, when [[Scott Lang]] discovers a way to bring back the fallen, the Avengers approach Stark, who initially refuses, considering the idea dangerously hypothetical. Despite this, he examines the matter privately and figures out how to do it successfully and agrees to help. Traveling through time, Stark fails to retrieve the Space Stone following the Battle of New York, and instead goes further back to the 1970s to steal it from a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where he has a moving conversation with a younger version of his father, Howard Stark.\n\nThe Avengers successfully obtain all of the Infinity Stones before returning to the present, which are incorporated into a gauntlet made by Stark which Banner then uses to resurrect those that were disintegrated by Thanos. However, they are followed by a 2014 version of Thanos and his forces, who are summoned to 2023 by an alternate version of [[Nebula (comics)|Nebula]]. During an ensuing battle, Thanos obtains Stark's gauntlet and the two of them wrestle for control of it. Thanos is able to fling Stark away before attempting another snap, but discovers that Stark has caused all of the Infinity Stones to move to Stark's own armor. Stark then uses them to disintegrate Thanos and all of his forces, saving the universe but fatally injuring himself in the process. He dies surrounded by Rhodes, Parker, and Potts. A funeral attended by many heroes is later held for him at his homestead.\n\nEight months later, the world continues to mourn Stark. Parker receives glasses that can access Stark's artificial intelligence E.D.I.T.H., with a message that establishes him as Stark's successor.{{refn|name=FFH|group=N|As depicted in the 2019 film ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''.}}\n\n==Film appearances==\nRobert Downey Jr. portrays Tony Stark in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] films ''Iron Man'' (2008),<ref name=\"DowneyCastIM\" /> ''Iron Man 2'' (2010),<ref name=\"RDJAugust2008\" /> ''The Avengers'' (2012),<ref name=\"DowneyCastAvengers\" /> ''Iron Man 3'' (2013),<ref name=\"DowneyAug2011\" /> ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' (2015),<ref name=\"DowneyAvengers2&3\" /> ''Captain America: Civil War'' (2016),<ref name=\"DowneyVariety2014\" /> ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' (2017),<ref name=\"KitTHR2016\" /> ''Avengers: Infinity War'' (2018),<ref name=\"DowneyAvengers2&3\" /> and ''Avengers: Endgame'' (2019).<ref name=\"DowneyVariety2014\" /> In addition, Downey makes an uncredited cameo appearance in ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (2008).<ref name=\"DowneyTIH\" /> He will reprise the role in ''[[Black Widow (2020 film)|Black Widow]]'' (2020).<ref name=\"DowneyBW\" />\n\n===References in other films===\n* In ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' (2014), Fury mentions that Stark help design the turbines for the new Helicarriers, after getting \"a closer look\" at them in ''The Avengers''.<ref name=\"StarkTWS\" />\n* In ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' (2017), the Quinjet's authentication for Thor is \"[[Point Break]]\", in reference to Stark's nickname for him.

That [[Eliot Ness]]-in-a-cape-type thing. What was really important to me was to not have him change so much that he's unrecognizable.

Downey and Favreau, who had been handed a script and worked from it on the first movie, conceived of the film's story themselves.<ref name=\"RDJAugust2008\" /> On Stark being a hero, Downey said \"It's kind of heroic, but really kind of on his own behalf. So I think there's probably a bit of an imposter complex and no sooner has he said, 'I am Iron Man &ndash;' that he's now really wondering what that means. If you have all this cushion like he does and the public is on your side and you have immense wealth and power, I think he's way too insulated to be okay.\"<ref name=\"DowneyComicCon\" />\n\n''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' introduced Stark's role as one of an ensemble of heroes who must come together to defend the Earth from an alien invasion led by the god [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]. Downey initially pushed director [[Joss Whedon]] to make Stark the lead of the 2012 ''Avengers'' film: \"Well, I said, 'I need to be in the opening sequence. I don't know what you're thinking, but Tony needs to drive this thing.' He was like, 'Okay, let's try that.' We tried it and it didn't work, because this is a different sort of thing, the story and the idea and the theme is the theme, and everybody is just an arm of the octopus.\"<ref name=\"BreznicanEW2011\" /> About the character's evolution from previous films, Downey said, \"In ''Iron Man'', which was an origin story, he was his own epiphany and redemption of sorts. ''Iron Man 2'' is all about not being an island, dealing with legacy issues and making space for others. . . In ''The Avengers'', he's throwing it down with the others\".<ref name=\"Filmink\" /> At the climax of the film, Stark guides a nuclear missile through an interstellar portal to destroy the main alien vessel, demonstrating a willingness to sacrifice his life to save the Earth.<ref name=\"MCUJourneySR\" />\n\n[[File:Robert Downey Jr at Comic Con 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Robert Downey Jr. at Comic Con 2007, after being cast in ''Iron Man''.]]\nIn ''[[Iron Man 3]]'', Stark struggles to come to terms with his near-death experience in ''The Avengers'',<ref name=\"StarkMCUProfile\" /> suffering from anxiety attacks.

Something tells me that it will not be the case, and [he] will be seen in a fourth, or fifth.\" Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said that the character of Stark would continue to be featured in the Marvel Cinematic Universe regardless of Downey's involvement.<ref name=\"BlackSR2013\" /> Also in March, Downey said he was open to extending his contract, stating he feels \"there's a couple other things we've gotta do\" with the character.<ref name=\"DowneySR2013\" /> In June 2013, when Downey signed on to return as Iron Man in ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', he also signed on for a third ''Avengers'' film.<ref name=\"DowneyAvengers2&3\" /> In a July 2014 interview during the filming of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'', Downey expressed his interest in continuing to play Iron Man. \"It's down to Kevin [Feige] and [[Isaac Perlmutter|Ike]] [Perlmutter, CEO of Marvel Entertainment] and Disney to come to us with what the proposal is, and that\u2019s on us to agree or disagree,\" Downey said. \"When things are going great, there's a lot of agreement.\" He added, \"It's that thing of: Why give up the belt when it feels like you can barely get jabbed?\"<ref name=\"DowneyJuly2014\" /> In April 2016, Downey expressed openness to appearing in a potential fourth ''Iron Man'' film, saying \"I could do one more.\"<ref name=\"DowneyCBR2016\" /> Downey's Marvel contract expired following ''Avengers: Endgame'', where Stark dies.<ref name=\"DowneyContract2019\" />\n\nStark's fashion sense evolved over the course of the films, initially being described as \"woefully basic...  mostly saggy jeans, henleys and tank tops\u2014with an occasional suit\", but improving by the time of the first ''Avengers'' film,<ref name=\"DworkenVulture\" /> and becoming more sophisticated by ''Civil War'', as Stark matured and accepted greater responsibility for the consequences of his actions.<ref name=\"MakovskyCW\" /> Downey expressed the desire for his wardrobe to reflect that \"you still know he's Tony Stark, and you still know that he's the richest man in the world\".<ref name=\"MakovskyCW\" /> Stark's clothing has been described as alternating between \"a sweet suit with some shades\" in his corporate look, \"or a t-shirt, jeans, and an arc reactor\" in his personal time.<ref name=\"CosplaysEndgame\" /> His fashion sense has been referred to as \"part Mob boss and part ''[[The Big Bang Theory|Big Bang Theory]]'' cast member\", and alternating \"between boxy pinstripe suits and faux-ironic vintage tees\".<ref name=\"DworkenVulture\" />\n\n===Armor and special effects===\n{{main|Iron Man's armor in other media}}\n[[File:Iron Man film armor.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Tony Stark's armor, as seen in ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008)]]\n\nFavreau wanted to make the initial film believable by showing the construction of the Iron Man suit in its three stages.<ref name=\"FavreauAICN\" /> [[Stan Winston]], a fan of the comic book, and his company, whom Favreau worked with on ''[[Zathura (film)|Zathura]]'' (2005), built metal and rubber versions of the armors.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> The Mark I design was intended to look like it was built from spare parts. The back is less armored than the front, because Stark would use his resources for a forward attack. It also foreshadows the design of Stane's armor. A single {{convert|90|lb|adj=on}} version was built, causing concern when a stuntman fell over inside it, though both the stuntman and the suit were unscathed. The armor was also designed to only have its top half worn at times.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> Stan Winston Studios built a {{convert|10|ft|adj=on}}, {{convert|800|lb|adj=on}} animatronic version of \"Iron Monger\",<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> a name which Obadiah Stane calls Tony Stark and himself earlier in the film as a reference, but is never actually used for the suit itself in the film. The animatronic required five operators for the arm, and was built on a [[gimbal]] to simulate walking.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> A [[scale model]] was used for the shots of it being built.<ref name=\"FavreauSHH\" /> The Mark II resembles an airplane prototype, with visible flaps.<ref name=\"FavreauSHH\" />\n\nIron Man comic book artist [[Adi Granov]] designed the Mark III with illustrator Phil Saunders.<ref name=\"GranovSaunders\" /> Granov's designs were the primary inspiration for the film's, and he came on board the film after he recognized his work on Jon Favreau's MySpace page.<ref name=\"FavreauAICN2\" /> Saunders streamlined Granov's concept art, making it stealthier and less cartoonish in its proportions,<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" /> and also designed the [[War Machine]] armor, but it was \"cut from the script about halfway through pre-production.\" He explained that the War Machine armor \"was going to be called the Mark IV armor and would have had weaponized swap-out parts that would be worn over the original Mark III armor,\" and that it \"would have been worn by Tony Stark in the final battle sequence.\"<ref name=\"WarMachine\" /> Concerned with the transition between the computer-generated and practical costumes, Favreau hired [[Industrial Light & Magic]] (ILM) to create the bulk of the visual effects for the film after seeing ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End]]'' and ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]''.<ref name=\"FavreauEffectsConcerns\" /> [[The Orphanage (company)|The Orphanage]] and [[The Embassy Visual Effects|The Embassy]] did additional work.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />  To help with animating the more refined suits, information was sometimes captured by having Downey wear only the helmet, sleeves and chest of the costume over a [[motion capture]] suit.<ref name=\"ProductionNotes\" />\n\nFor ''Iron Man 2'', ILM again did the majority of the effects, as it did on the first film.<ref name=\"ILMBenSnow\" /> ILM's visual effects supervisor on the film, [[Ben Snow]], said their work on the film was \"harder\" than their work on the first, stating that Favreau asked more of them this time around. Snow described the process of digitally creating the suits:\n{{quote|text=On the first ''Iron Man'', we tried to use the Legacy [Studios, [[Stan Winston]]'s effects company] and Stan Winston suits as much as we could. For the second one, Jon [Favreau] was confident we could create the [[Computer-generated imagery|CG]] suits, and the action dictated using them. So, Legacy created what we called the \"football suits\" from the torso up with a chest plate and helmet. We'd usually put in some arm pieces, but not the whole arm. In the house fight sequence, where Robert Downey Jr. staggers around tipsy, we used some of the practical suit and extended it digitally. Same thing in the [[Randy's Donuts]] scene. But in the rest of the film, we used the CG suit entirely. And [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] did an all-digital suit for the Monaco chase.<ref name=\"ILMBenSnow\" />}}\n\nIn the filming of ''The Avengers'', [[Weta Digital]] took over duties for animating Iron Man during the forest duel from ILM. Guy Williams, Weta's visual effects supervisor, said, \"We shared assets back and forth with ILM, but our pipelines are unique and it's hard for other assets to plug into it. But in this case, we got their models and we had to redo the texture spaces because the way we texture maps is different.\"<ref name=\"AWN\" /> Williams said the most difficult part was re-creating Iron Man's reflective metal surfaces.<ref name=\"Fxguide\" />\n\nFor ''Iron Man 3'', [[Digital Domain]], [[Scanline VFX]] and Trixter each worked on separate shots featuring the Mark 42 armor, working with different digital models. The studios shared some of their files to ensure consistency between the shots. For the Mark 42 and Iron Patriot armors, [[Legacy Effects]] constructed partial suits that were worn on set. Townsend explained that \"Invariably we'd shoot a soft-suit with Robert then we'd also put [[motion capture|tracking markers]] on his trousers. He would also wear lifts in his shoes or be up in a box so he'd be the correct height\u2014Iron Man is 6'5\". During shooting we used multiple witness cams, [[Canon EOS C300|Canon C300s]], and we had two or three running whenever there was an Iron Man or Extremis character.\"<ref name=\"Fxguide2\" /> The heads-up display features of the helmet were inspired by visualization techniques from MRI diagnostic pattern recognition and graph theory, particularly by the [[connectogram]], a circular graph that maps all of the white-matter connections of the human brain.<ref name=\"BarbasMRI\" />\n\n==Differences from the comics==\nThe origin story of Iron Man has been updated for the films. In the comics, Stark becomes Iron Man following an experience in the [[Vietnam War]], which is changed to the [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|War in Afghanistan]].<ref name=\"EraoSR\" /> [[Edwin Jarvis|Jarvis]], in the comics, is the family butler, while in the films [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]] is an artificial intelligence created by Stark,<ref name=\"HowardCB\" /> though still inspired by the butler from Stark's childhood who is revealed to have passed away by the time the first film takes place.<ref name=\"EraoSR\" /> Stark also proceeds through the early iterations of his armor to reach the now-familiar red and gold color scheme much more quickly. Stark's personality more closely resembles the Ultimate Comics version.<ref name=\"EraoSR\" />\n\nThe AI version of J.A.R.V.I.S. is eventually uploaded by Stark to an artificial body and becomes [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]]. In the films, Vision is created by Stark and Banner as a counter to Ultron. In the comics, however, Ultron is created by a different member of the Avengers, [[Hank Pym]], and aspects of Pym's personality are integrated into this version of Stark, such as a desire for peace.<ref name=\"BrowneSR\" /> Another difference in the films is the romance between Stark and Pepper Potts. In the comics, Potts has unrequited feelings for Stark, and ultimately becomes involved with Stark's chauffeur and bodyguard, Happy Hogan.<ref name=\"HowardCB\" /><ref name=\"BrowneSR\" />\n\nA new approach not seen in comics is Stark's mentorial relationship with [[Peter Parker (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Peter Parker]]. In the [[Ultimate Comics]], Stark and Parker do not go past the normal trainer-trainee relationship. In the MCU, Stark is also the creator of multiple iterations of Parker's Spider-Man suits, unlike in the comics where he only creates the [[Iron Spider|Iron Spider Armor]], while Parker creates other suits by himself.<ref name=\"McMillanWired\" /> Stark is also shown to have a history with Parker's foes [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]] and [[Mysterio (comics)|Mysterio]]; both are depicted as having turned into villains after due to actions by Stark. While he does not end up facing them, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 does.<ref name=\"VultureSR\" /><ref name=\"MysterioPS\" />\n\nThe Mandarin, a recurring Iron Man villain in the comics, turns out to be just an actor portraying the character, with the real criminal mastermind behind the acts claimed by \"the Mandarin\" being [[Aldrich Killian]]\u2014a minor character in the comics.<ref name=\"BrowneSR\" /><ref name=\"MandarinMTV\" /> The Mandarin is revealed to be a real person in the Marvel One-Shot ''[[All Hail the King]]'',<ref name=\"MandarinSR\" /> this version will instead by portrayed as an enemy of [[Shang-Chi]] in ''[[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings]]'' (2021).<ref name=\"MandarinShangChi\" />\n\n==Reception==\nDowney's portrayal of the character has been positively received by fans and critics. [[Roger Ebert]] praised Downey's performance in ''Iron Man'', stating \"At the end of the day it's Robert Downey Jr. who powers the lift-off separating this from most other superhero movies\".<ref name=\"Ebert\" /> [[Frank Lovece]] of ''[[Film Journal International]]'', a one-time Marvel Comics writer, commended that ''Iron Man 2'' \"doesn't find a changed man. Inside the metal, imperfect humanity grows even more so, as thought-provoking questions of identity meet techno-fantasy made flesh\".<ref name=\"FrankLoveceReview\" />\n\nFor ''The Avengers'', Joe Morgenstern of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''\u2014despite complimenting Downey's performance\u2014favored his work in ''Iron Man'' over his acting in ''The Avengers'': \"His Iron Man is certainly a team player, but Mr. Downey comes to the party with two insuperable superpowers: a character of established sophistication\u2014the industrialist/inventor Tony Stark, a sharp-tongued man of the world\u2014and his own quicksilver presence that finds its finest expression in self-irony\".<ref name=\"MorgensternAvengers\" /> In his review of ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', Morgenstern lauded both actor and character, praising \"Robert Downey Jr.'s startlingly smart Tony Stark\" who, along with Chris Evans' Captain America and Chris Hemsworth's Thor, contributed to that film's \"feeling of family ... because the debuts of its most prominent members remain vivid to this day.\"<ref name=\"MorgensternEndgame\" />\n\nIn 2015, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' named Tony Stark the 13th greatest film character of all time.<ref name=\"EmpireGreatest\" /> In 2019, following Stark's death in ''Avengers: Endgame'', a statute representing the character in his was Iron Man armor was erected in [[Forte dei Marmi]], Italy.<ref name=\"ItalyStatue\" />\n\n===Accolades===\n{{Anchor|Awards|Accolades}}\nDowney has received numerous nominations and awards for his portrayal of Tony Stark. He notably won the [[Saturn Award for Best Actor]] three times,<ref name=\"2009SaturnAwards\" /><ref name=\"2014SaturnAwards\" /><ref name=\"2019SaturnAwards\" /> making him a record four-time winner (he had previously won the award for 1993's ''[[Heart and Souls]]'');<ref name=\"1994SaturnAwards\" /> it is also the record for most wins for portraying the same character, tied with [[Mark Hamill]] for playing [[Luke Skywalker]].<ref name=\"HamillSaturn\" /><ref name=\"HamillSaturn2\" /><ref name=\"HamillSaturn3\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!
