Strongly influenced by [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[XTC]], and [[Talking Heads]], the band rehearsed, rearranged, and recorded demos for almost two years before finally signing with small-town indie label [[K Records]] and releasing numerous singles.<ref>[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/72297]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSince their 1996 debut ''[[This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About]]'', the band's lineup has centered on Brock and Green.

Judy performed on every Modest Mouse album until his departure in 2012. [[Guitar]]ist [[Johnny Marr]] (formerly of [[the Smiths]]) joined the band in 2006, shortly following [[percussion]]ist [[Joe Plummer]] (formerly of [[the Black Heart Procession]]) and multi-instrumentalist [[Tom Peloso]], to work on the album ''[[We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank]]'' (2007). Guitarist [[Jim Fairchild]] joined the band in 2009. The band's sixth album ''[[Strangers to Ourselves]]'' was released on March 17, 2015.\n\n== History ==\n=== Formation and early years: 1992\u20131999 ===\nWhen Isaac Brock was a teenager, he was employed at a local family video store just outside Seattle.

In 1994, at [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]]'s Dub Narcotic Studios, Modest Mouse recorded its first [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect?]]'', which was released by [[K Records]]. This was followed by a single, \"[[Broke (Modest Mouse song)|Broke]]\", recorded by Steve Wold (a.k.a. bluesman [[Seasick Steve]]) under [[Sub Pop]] records at Moon Studios in [[Olympia, Washington]]. During this time, Modest Mouse also recorded what would have been its first album, ''[[Sad Sappy Sucker]]'', but constant delays caused the album to be shelved and forgotten. It was not until 2001 that it was officially released. Before the band made its way into the pop music world in 2004, many of Modest Mouse's tours included stops at DIY/punk venues.\n\nAfter moving to [[Up Records]],<ref>\"[http://epitonic.com/artists/modest-mouse/ Modest Mouse]\" [bio].

The 1997 album, ''[[The Lonesome Crowded West]]'' (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) served as the band's breakthrough.

an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1992 in [[Issaquah, Washington]] and currently based in [[Portland, Oregon]]. The founding members are lead singer/guitarist [[Isaac Brock (musician)|Isaac Brock]], drummer [[Jeremiah Green]], and bassist [[Eric Judy]]. Strongly influenced by [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]], [[XTC]], and [[Talking Heads]], the band rehearsed, rearranged, and recorded demos for almost two years before finally signing with small-town indie label [[K Records]] and releasing numerous singles.<ref>[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/72297]{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSince their 1996 debut ''[[This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About]]'', the band's lineup has centered on Brock and Green. The band achieved mainstream success with their fourth album ''[[Good News for People Who Love Bad News]]'' (2004) and its singles \"[[Float On (Modest Mouse song)|Float On]]\" and \"[[Ocean Breathes Salty]]\". Judy performed on every Modest Mouse album until his departure in 2012. [[Guitar]]ist [[Johnny Marr]] (formerly of [[the Smiths]]) joined the band in 2006, shortly following [[percussion]]ist [[Joe Plummer]] (formerly of [[the Black Heart Procession]]) and multi-instrumentalist [[Tom Peloso]], to work on the album ''[[We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank]]'' (2007). Guitarist [[Jim Fairchild]] joined the band in 2009. The band's sixth album ''[[Strangers to Ourselves]]'' was released on March 17, 2015.\n\n== History ==\n=== Formation and early years: 1992\u20131999 ===\nWhen Isaac Brock was a teenager, he was employed at a local family video store just outside Seattle. This is where he met bassist [[Eric Judy]]. Brock and Judy later discovered drummer [[Jeremiah Green]],<ref name=\"Carpenter, Susan 2004\">Carpenter, Susan. \"THE ARTS; POP MUSIC; from Modest Beginnings ...; nearly 15 Years from its Seattle Grunge Origins, Modest Mouse's Career has Taken a Mighty Turn\".

In 1994, at [[Calvin Johnson (musician)|Calvin Johnson]]'s Dub Narcotic Studios, Modest Mouse recorded its first [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect?]]'', which was released by [[K Records]]. This was followed by a single, \"[[Broke (Modest Mouse song)|Broke]]\", recorded by Steve Wold (a.k.a. bluesman [[Seasick Steve]]) under [[Sub Pop]] records at Moon Studios in [[Olympia, Washington]]. During this time, Modest Mouse also recorded what would have been its first album, ''[[Sad Sappy Sucker]]'', but constant delays caused the album to be shelved and forgotten. It was not until 2001 that it was officially released. Before the band made its way into the pop music world in 2004, many of Modest Mouse's tours included stops at DIY/punk venues.\n\nAfter moving to [[Up Records]],<ref>\"[http://epitonic.com/artists/modest-mouse/ Modest Mouse]\" [bio]. ''[[Epitonic]]''. epitonic.com. Retrieved 2017-05-07.</ref> Modest Mouse released two full-length albums and other recordings including the 1996 LP ''[[This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About]]''. Steve Wold also recorded and produced this album (and at the time was assisting in the recordings as well, but was not officially part of the band) along with the next offering, ''[[Interstate 8 (album)|Interstate 8]]''. The 1997 album, ''[[The Lonesome Crowded West]]'' (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) served as the band's breakthrough. ''The Lonesome Crowded West'' gained the band a [[cult following]], and is now popularly considered to be one of the defining albums of mid-1990s indie rock.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=McMurray|editor-first=\u00a0Jacob|title=Taking Punk to the Masses: From Nowhere to Nevermind : a Visual History from the Permanent Collection of Experience Music Project|publisher=Fantagraphics Books|location=Seattle|year=2011|isbn=9781606994337|OCLC=1065713061}}</ref> During this time, Nick Kraft became involved with the task of refining the band's sound.

Hood wrote regularly for ''[[The London Magazine]]'',  ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'', and ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]''. He later published a magazine largely consisting of his own works. Hood, never robust, lapsed into invalidism by the age of 41 and died at the age of 45. [[William Michael Rossetti]] in 1903 called him \"the finest English poet\" between the generations of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]].<ref name=rossetti>Rossetti, W. M. Biographical Introduction, [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15652/15652-h/15652-h.htm ''The Poetical Works of Thomas Hood'']. (London, 1903).</ref> Hood was the father of playwright and humorist [[Tom Hood]] (1835\u20131874).\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Plaque re Thomas Hood, Poultry, EC2 - geograph.org.uk - 1096440.jpg|thumb|Plaque in Cheapside, [[City of London]], marking the site of the house where Thomas Hood was born]]\nHe was born in London to Thomas Hood and Elizabeth Sands in the [[Poultry, London|Poultry]] ([[Cheapside]]) above his father's bookshop. Hood's paternal family had been Scottish farmers from the village of [[Errol, Perth and Kinross|Errol]] near [[Dundee]]. The elder Hood was a partner in the business of Verner, Hood and Sharp, a member of the Associated Booksellers. Hood's son, Tom Hood, claimed that his grandfather had been the first to open up the book trade with America and he had great success with new editions of old books.<ref>J. C. Reid, p. 10.</ref>\n\n\"Next to being a citizen of the world,\" writes Thomas Hood in his ''Literary Reminiscences'', \"it must be the best thing to be born a citizen of the world's greatest city.\" On the death of her husband in 1811, his mother moved to [[Islington]], where Thomas Hood had a schoolmaster who appreciating his talents, \"made him feel it impossible not to take an interest in learning while he seemed so interested in teaching.\" Under the care of this \"decayed dominie\", he earned a few guineas \u2013 his first literary fee \u2013 by revising for the press a new edition of the 1788 novel ''[[Paul et Virginie|Paul and Virginia]]''.\n\nHood left his private schoolmaster at 14 years of age and was admitted soon after into the [[counting house]] of a friend of his family, where he \"turned his stool into a [[Pegasus]] on three legs, every [[Foot (prosody)|foot]], of course, being a dactyl or a spondee.\" However, the uncongenial profession affected his health, which was never strong, and he began to study engraving. The exact nature and course of his study is unclear: various sources tell different stories. Reid emphasizes his work under his maternal uncle Robert Sands,<ref>J. C. Reid, p. 19.</ref> but no deeds of apprenticeship exist and we also know from his letters that he studied with a Mr Harris. Hood's daughter in her ''Memorials'' mentions her father's association with the [[John Le Keux|Le Keux]] brothers, who were successful engravers in the City.<ref>''Memorials'', p. 5.</ref>\n\nThe labour of engraving was no better for his health than the counting house had been, and Hood was sent to his father's relations at [[Dundee, Scotland]]. There he stayed in the house of his maternal aunt, Jean Keay, for some months and then, on falling out with her, moved on to the boarding house of one of her friends, Mrs Butterworth, where he lived for the rest of his time in Scotland.<ref>His living situation in Dundee was pieced together by George Maxwell in ''Hood in Scotland''. See particularly Chapter III.</ref> In Dundee, Hood made a number of close friends with whom he continued to correspond for many years. He led a healthy outdoor life but also became a wide and indiscriminate reader. During his time there, Hood began seriously to write poetry and appeared in print for the first time, with a letter to the editor of the ''Dundee Advertiser''.\n\n==Literary society==\nBefore long Hood was contributing humorous and poetical pieces to provincial newspapers and magazines. As a proof of his literary vocation, he would write out his poems in printed characters, believing that this process best enabled him to understand his own peculiarities and faults, and probably unaware that [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] had recommended some such method of criticism when he said he thought, \"Print settles it.\" On his return to London in 1818 he applied himself to [[engraving]], which enabled him later to illustrate his various humours and fancies.\n\nIn 1821, [[John Scott (London editor)|John Scott]], editor of ''[[The London Magazine]]'', was killed in a [[duel]], and the periodical passed into the hands of some friends of Hood, who proposed to make him sub-editor. This post at once introduced him to the [[literary society]] of the time. In becoming an associate of [[John Hamilton Reynolds]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], [[Henry Francis Cary|Henry Cary]], [[Thomas de Quincey]], [[Allan Cunningham (author)|Allan Cunningham]], [[Bryan Procter]], [[Serjeant Talfourd]], [[Hartley Coleridge]], the peasant-poet [[John Clare]] and other contributors, he gradually developed his own powers.\n\n==Family life==\n[[File:Jane Hood (n\u00e9e Reynolds) from NPG.jpg|right|thumb|Thomas Hood's wife, Jane]]\nHood married in May 1824,<ref>In ''Memorials'', p. 17, his daughter Francis gives the date of her parents' marriage as 5 May 1824. J. C. Reid, p. 67, on the other hand, gives 5 May of the following year.</ref>  and ''Odes and Addresses'' \u2013 his first volume \u2013 was written in conjunction with his brother-in-law J. H. Reynolds, a friend of [[John Keats]]. Coleridge wrote to Lamb averring that the book must be the latter's work. Also from this period are ''The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies'' (1827) and a dramatic romance, ''Lamia'', published later. ''The Plea'' was a book of serious verse, but Hood was known as a humorist and the book was ignored almost entirely.\n\nHood was fond of practical jokes, which he was said to have enjoyed perpetrating on members of his family. In the ''Memorials'' there is a story of Hood instructing his wife to purchase some fish for the evening meal from a woman who regularly came to the door selling her husband's catch. But he warns her to watch for [[plaice]] that \"has any appearance of red or orange spots, as they are a sure sign of an advanced stage of decomposition.\" Mrs Hood refused to purchase the fish-seller's plaice, exclaiming, \"My good woman... I could not think of buying any plaice with those very unpleasant red spots!\" The fish-seller was amazed at such ignorance of what plaice look like.<ref>''Memorials'', pp. 23\u201324.</ref>\n\nThe series of the ''Comic Annual'', dating from 1830, was a kind of publication popular at that time, which Hood undertook and continued almost unassisted for several years. Under that title he treated all the leading events of the day in caricature, without personal malice, and with an undercurrent of sympathy. Readers were also treated to an incessant use of [[pun]]s, of which Hood had written in his own vindication, \"However critics may take offence,/A double meaning has double sense\", but as he gained experience as a writer, his diction became simpler.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}\n\n==Later writings==\nIn another annual called the ''Gem'' appeared the verse story of [[Eugene Aram]]. Hood started a magazine in his own name, which was mainly sustained by his own activity. He conducted the work from a sick-bed from which he never rose, and there also composed well-known poems such as \"The Song of the Shirt\", which appeared anonymously in the Christmas number of ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'', 1843 and was immediately reprinted in ''[[The Times]]'' and other newspapers across Europe. It was dramatised by Mark Lemon as ''The Sempstress'', printed on broadsheets and cotton handkerchiefs, and was highly praised by many of the literary establishment, including Charles Dickens. Likewise \"[[The Bridge of Sighs (poem)|The Bridge of Sighs]]\" and \"The Song of the Labourer\", which were also translated into German by [[Ferdinand Freiligrath]]. These are plain, solemn pictures of conditions of life, which appeared shortly before Hood's own death in May 1845.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nHood was associated with the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'', started in 1828 by [[James Silk Buckingham]], and he was a regular contributor for the rest of his life. Prolonged illness brought on straitened circumstances. Application was made by a number of Hood's friends to [[Sir Robert Peel]] to place Hood's name on the civil pension list with which the British state rewarded literary men. Peel was known to be an admirer of Hood's work and in the last few months of Hood's life he gave Jane Hood the sum of \u00a3100 without her husband's knowledge to alleviate the family's debts.<ref>Clubbe, p. 181.</ref> The pension that Peel's government bestowed on Hood was continued to his wife and family after his death. Jane Hood, who also suffered from poor health and had expended tremendous energy tending to her husband in his last year, died only 18 months later. The pension then ceased, but [[Lord John Russell]], grandfather of the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], made arrangements for a \u00a350 pension for the maintenance of Hood's two children, [[Frances Freeling Broderip|Frances]] and [[Tom Hood|Tom]].<ref>Clubbe, p. 196.</ref>\n\nNine years later, a monument raised by public subscription in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] was unveiled by [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Richard Monckton Milnes]].\n\n[[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]], a friend of Hood's, gave this assessment of him: \"Oh sad, marvellous picture of courage, of honesty, of patient endurance, of duty struggling against pain! ... Here is one at least without guile, without pretension, without scheming, of a pure life, to his family and little modest circle of friends tenderly devoted.\"<ref>J. C. Reid, p. 235.</ref>\n\nThe house where Hood died, No. 28 Finchley Road, in the [[St. John's Wood]] area of London, now has a [[blue plaque]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/468 |title=Thomas Hood \u2013 Blue plaque |publisher=Open Plaques |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Examples of his works==\nHood wrote humorously on many contemporary issues. One of the most important issues in his time was grave robbing and selling of corpses to anatomists (see [[West Port murders]]). On this serious and perhaps cruel issue, he wrote wryly,\n<blockquote>\n''Don't go to weep upon my grave,''<br />\n''And think that there I be.''<br />\n''They haven't left an atom there''<br />\n''Of my anatomie.''\n</blockquote>\n\nNovember in London is usually cool and overcast, and in Hood's day subject to frequent fog and [[smog]]. In 1844 he wrote,\n<blockquote>\n''No sun \u2013 no moon! ''<br />\n''No morn \u2013 no noon \u2013 ''<br />\n''No dawn \u2013 no dusk \u2013 no proper time of day. ''<br />\n''No warmth, no cheerfulness, no healthful ease, ''<br />\n''No comfortable feel in any member \u2013 ''<br />\n''No shade, no shine, no butterflies, no bees,  ''<br />\n''No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no birds \u2013 ''<br />\n''November!''\n</blockquote>\n\nAn example of Hood's reflective and sentimental verse is the famous \"I Remember, I Remember\", excerpted here:\n<blockquote>\n''I remember, I remember''<br />\n''The house where I was born,''<br />\n''The little window where the sun''<br />\n''Came peeping in at morn;''<br />\n''He never came a wink too soon''<br />\n''Nor brought too long a day;''<br />\n''But now, I often wish the night''<br />\n''Had borne my breath away.''\n\n''I remember, I remember''<br />\n''The roses, red and white,''<br />\n''The violets, and the lily-cups''<br />\n''Those flowers made of light!''<br />\n''The lilacs where the robin built,''<br />\n''And where my brother set''<br />\n''The laburnum on his birth-day,''<br />\n''The tree is living yet!''\n\n''I remember, I remember''<br />\n''Where I used to swing,''<br />\n''And thought the air must rush as fresh''<br />\n''To swallows on the wing;''<br />\n''My spirit flew in feathers then''<br />\n''That is so heavy now,''<br />\n''And summer pools could hardly cool''<br />\n''The fever on my brow.''\n\n''I remember, I remember''<br />\n''The fir trees dark and high;''<br />\n''I used to think their slender tops''<br />\n''Were close against the sky:''<br />\n''It was childish ignorance,''<br />\n''But now 'tis little joy''<br />\n''To know I'm farther off from Heaven''<br />\n''Than when I was a boy.''\n</blockquote>\n\nHood's most widely known work during his lifetime was \"[[The Song of the Shirt]]\", a verse lament for a London seamstress compelled to sell shirts she had made, the proceeds of which lawfully belonged to her employer, in order to feed her malnourished and ailing child. Hood's poem appeared in one of the first editions of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1843 and quickly became a public sensation, being turned into a popular song and inspiring social activists in defence of countless industrious labouring women living in abject poverty. An excerpt: \n<blockquote>\n''With fingers weary and worn,''<br />\n''With eyelids heavy and red,''<br />\n''A woman sat, in unwomanly rags,''<br />\n''Plying her needle and thread--''<br />\n''Stitch! stitch! stitch!''<br />\n''In poverty, hunger, and dirt,''<br />\n''And still with a voice of dolorous pitch''<br />\n''She sang the \"Song of the Shirt.\"''\n\n''\"Work! work! work!''<br />\n''While the cock is crowing aloof!''<br />\n''And work\u2014work\u2014work,''<br />\n''Till the stars shine through the roof!''<br />\n''It's Oh! to be a slave''<br />\n''Along with the barbarous Turk,''<br />\n''Where woman has never a soul to save,''<br />\n''If this is Christian work!\"''\n</blockquote>\n\n==Modern references==\n*''[[Metro-Land (1973 film)|Metro-Land]]'' \u2013 [[John Betjeman]] (1973)\n*\"Opus 4\" \u2013 [[The Art of Noise]] (album: ''[[In Visible Silence]]'', 1986)\n*''The Piano'' \u2013 [[Jane Campion]] (1993)\n*''So Much Blood'' \u2013 [[Simon Brett]] (1976)\n\n==Works by Thomas Hood==\nThe list of Hood's separately published works is as follows:\n*''Odes and Addresses to Great People'' (1825)\n*''Whims and Oddities'' (two series, 1826 and 1827)\n*''The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies, hero and Leander, Lycus the Centaur and other Poems'' (1827), his only collection of serious verse\n*''The Epping Hunt'' illustrated by [[George Cruikshank]] (1829)\n*''The Dream of Eugene Aram, the Murderer'' (1831)\n*''Tylney Hall'', a novel (3 vols., 1834)\n*''The Comic Annual'' (1830\u201342)\n*''Hood's Own, or, Laughter from Year to Year'' (1838, second series, 1861)\n*''Up the Rhine'' (1840)\n*''[[Hood's Magazine and Comic Miscellany]]'' (1844\u201348)\n*''National Tales'' (2 vols., 1837), a collection of short novelettes, including \"[[The Three Jewels (Short Story)|The Three Jewels]]\".\n*''Whimsicalities'' (1844), with illustrations from [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]'s designs; and many contributions to contemporary periodicals.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*John Clubbe, ''Victorian Forerunner; The Later Career of Thomas Hood'' (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1968)\n*Frances Hood, ''[https://archive.org/stream/memorialsofthoma03hood#page/n15/mode/2up The Memorials of Thomas Hood \u2013 Vol. 1]'' and ''[https://archive.org/details/memorialsofthoma02hooduoft The Memorials of Thomas Hood \u2013 Vol. 2]'' (Boston: Ticknor & Fields, 1860)\n*[[Walter Jerrold]], ''[https://archive.org/details/thomashoodhislif00jerr Thomas Hood; His Life and Times]'' (New York: John Lane, 1909)\n*Alex Elliot (ed.), ''[https://archive.org/details/hoodinscotlandre00elio Hood in Scotland]'' (Dundee: James P.

These are plain, solemn pictures of conditions of life, which appeared shortly before Hood's own death in May 1845.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nHood was associated with the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'', started in 1828 by [[James Silk Buckingham]], and he was a regular contributor for the rest of his life. Prolonged illness brought on straitened circumstances. Application was made by a number of Hood's friends to [[Sir Robert Peel]] to place Hood's name on the civil pension list with which the British state rewarded literary men. Peel was known to be an admirer of Hood's work and in the last few months of Hood's life he gave Jane Hood the sum of \u00a3100 without her husband's knowledge to alleviate the family's debts.<ref>Clubbe, p. 181.</ref> The pension that Peel's government bestowed on Hood was continued to his wife and family after his death. Jane Hood, who also suffered from poor health and had expended tremendous energy tending to her husband in his last year, died only 18 months later. The pension then ceased, but [[Lord John Russell]], grandfather of the philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]], made arrangements for a \u00a350 pension for the maintenance of Hood's two children, [[Frances Freeling Broderip|Frances]] and [[Tom Hood|Tom]].<ref>Clubbe, p. 196.</ref>\n\nNine years later, a monument raised by public subscription in [[Kensal Green Cemetery]] was unveiled by [[Richard Monckton Milnes, 1st Baron Houghton|Richard Monckton Milnes]].\n\n[[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]], a friend of Hood's, gave this assessment of him: \"Oh sad, marvellous picture of courage, of honesty, of patient endurance, of duty struggling against pain! ... Here is one at least without guile, without pretension, without scheming, of a pure life, to his family and little modest circle of friends tenderly devoted.\"<ref>J. C. Reid, p. 235.</ref>\n\nThe house where Hood died, No. 28 Finchley Road, in the [[St. John's Wood]] area of London, now has a [[blue plaque]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/468 |title=Thomas Hood \u2013 Blue plaque |publisher=Open Plaques |accessdate=7 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Examples of his works==\nHood wrote humorously on many contemporary issues. One of the most important issues in his time was grave robbing and selling of corpses to anatomists (see [[West Port murders]]). On this serious and perhaps cruel issue, he wrote wryly,\n<blockquote>\n''Don't go to weep upon my grave,''<br />\n''And think that there I be.''<br />\n''They haven't left an atom there''<br />\n''Of my anatomie.''\n</blockquote>\n\nNovember in London is usually cool and overcast, and in Hood's day subject to frequent fog and [[smog]]. In 1844 he wrote,\n<blockquote>\n''No sun \u2013 no moon! ''<br />\n''No morn \u2013 no noon \u2013 ''<br />\n''No dawn \u2013 no dusk \u2013 no proper time of day. ''<br />\n''No warmth, no cheerfulness, no healthful ease, ''<br />\n''No comfortable feel in any member \u2013 ''<br />\n''No shade, no shine, no butterflies, no bees,  ''<br />\n''No fruits, no flowers, no leaves, no birds \u2013 ''<br />\n''November!''\n</blockquote>\n\nAn example of Hood's reflective and sentimental verse is the famous \"I Remember, I Remember\", excerpted here:\n<blockquote>\n''I remember, I remember''<br />\n''The house where I was born,''<br />\n''The little window where the sun''<br />\n''Came peeping in at morn;''<br />\n''He never came a wink too soon''<br />\n''Nor brought too long a day;''<br />\n''But now, I often wish the night''<br />\n''Had borne my breath away.''\n\n''I remember, I remember''<br />\n''The roses, red and white,''<br />\n''The violets, and the lily-cups''<br />\n''Those flowers made of light!''<br />\n''The lilacs where the robin built,''<br />\n''And where my brother set''<br />\n''The laburnum on his birth-day,''<br />\n''The tree is living yet!''\n\n''I remember, I remember''<br />\n''Where I used to swing,''<br />\n''And thought the air must rush as fresh''<br />\n''To swallows on the wing;''<br />\n''My spirit flew in feathers then''<br />\n''That is so heavy now,''<br />\n''And summer pools could hardly cool''<br />\n''The fever on my brow.''\n\n''I remember, I remember''<br />\n''The fir trees dark and high;''<br />\n''I used to think their slender tops''<br />\n''Were close against the sky:''<br />\n''It was childish ignorance,''<br />\n''But now 'tis little joy''<br />\n''To know I'm farther off from Heaven''<br />\n''Than when I was a boy.''\n</blockquote>\n\nHood's most widely known work during his lifetime was \"[[The Song of the Shirt]]\", a verse lament for a London seamstress compelled to sell shirts she had made, the proceeds of which lawfully belonged to her employer, in order to feed her malnourished and ailing child. Hood's poem appeared in one of the first editions of ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1843 and quickly became a public sensation, being turned into a popular song and inspiring social activists in defence of countless industrious labouring women living in abject poverty. An excerpt: \n<blockquote>\n''With fingers weary and worn,''<br />\n''With eyelids heavy and red,''<br />\n''A woman sat, in unwomanly rags,''<br />\n''Plying her needle and thread--''<br />\n''Stitch! stitch! stitch!''<br />\n''In poverty, hunger, and dirt,''<br />\n''And still with a voice of dolorous pitch''<br />\n''She sang the \"Song of the Shirt.\"''\n\n''\"Work! work! work!''<br />\n''While the cock is crowing aloof!''<br />\n''And work\u2014work\u2014work,''<br />\n''Till the stars shine through the roof!''<br />\n''It's Oh! to be a slave''<br />\n''Along with the barbarous Turk,''<br />\n''Where woman has never a soul to save,''<br />\n''If this is Christian work!\"''\n</blockquote>\n\n==Modern references==\n*''[[Metro-Land (1973 film)|Metro-Land]]'' \u2013 [[John Betjeman]] (1973)\n*\"Opus 4\" \u2013 [[The Art of Noise]] (album: ''[[In Visible Silence]]'', 1986)\n*''The Piano'' \u2013 [[Jane Campion]] (1993)\n*''So Much Blood'' \u2013 [[Simon Brett]] (1976)\n\n==Works by Thomas Hood==\nThe list of Hood's separately published works is as follows:\n*''Odes and Addresses to Great People'' (1825)\n*''Whims and Oddities'' (two series, 1826 and 1827)\n*''The Plea of the Midsummer Fairies, hero and Leander, Lycus the Centaur and other Poems'' (1827), his only collection of serious verse\n*''The Epping Hunt'' illustrated by [[George Cruikshank]] (1829)\n*''The Dream of Eugene Aram, the Murderer'' (1831)\n*''Tylney Hall'', a novel (3 vols., 1834)\n*''The Comic Annual'' (1830\u201342)\n*''Hood's Own, or, Laughter from Year to Year'' (1838, second series, 1861)\n*''Up the Rhine'' (1840)\n*''[[Hood's Magazine and Comic Miscellany]]'' (1844\u201348)\n*''National Tales'' (2 vols., 1837), a collection of short novelettes, including \"[[The Three Jewels (Short Story)|The Three Jewels]]\".\n*''Whimsicalities'' (1844), with illustrations from [[John Leech (caricaturist)|John Leech]]'s designs; and many contributions to contemporary periodicals.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*John Clubbe, ''Victorian Forerunner; The Later Career of Thomas Hood'' (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1968)\n*Frances Hood, ''[https://archive.org/stream/memorialsofthoma03hood#page/n15/mode/2up The Memorials of Thomas Hood \u2013 Vol. 1]'' and ''[https://archive.org/details/memorialsofthoma02hooduoft The Memorials of Thomas Hood \u2013 Vol. 2]'' (Boston: Ticknor & Fields, 1860)\n*[[Walter Jerrold]], ''[https://archive.org/details/thomashoodhislif00jerr Thomas Hood; His Life and Times]'' (New York: John Lane, 1909)\n*Alex Elliot (ed.), ''[https://archive.org/details/hoodinscotlandre00elio Hood in Scotland]'' (Dundee: James P.

'Ubadah participated in at least seven large scale military campaigns during his life before ending his career as a [[Qadi]] in the [[Holy Land]]. In his later years 'Ubadah assisted the soon to be [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad Caliph]] [[Muawiya I]], who at the time was serving as a governor.

In historical literature, these clan leaders are said to have done Hajj to see enlightenment after they grew weary due to the conflicts that were happening between their tribes. Particularly the latest civil war of Yathrib, which Muslim historians called [[Battle of Bu'adh]], is an event that was described to be very destructive in the result of causing many traumatic casualties. 'Ubadah, Sa'd and other chieftains were described to have had their heart broken after witnessing the aftermath of the battle.\n\nThen on their way towards Mecca, 'Ubadah and his clan leaders' colleagues met with Muhammad, who preached Islam to any Hajj [[Pilgrim|pilgrims]] he met. They listened to his preaching until they thought of Muhammad as the solution to their problem as they thought Muhammad can unite their conflicting tribes in Medina.

The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals. \n\n=== Arcs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%93%20%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%20%ED%95%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8|title=Namuwiki|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ===\n'''Arc 1: Round with Gods / (Episode 1 to 41)''' The start of the \"God of High School\" competition.\n\n'''Arc 2: National Tournament / (Episode 42 to 112)''' Depicts the battles between participants in the mid- and late national stages.\n\n'''Arc 2.5: Jin Tae-jin Story/ (Episode 113 to 118)''' Centers on Jin Tae-Jin's past during an infiltration mission in North Korea and how he adopted Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 3: Adventure / (Episode 119-172)''' \n\n'''Arc 4: World Championships / (Episode 173 to 216)''' The arc feature a consolation match and introduces the character of Hui Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 5: Ragnarok / (Episode 217 to 307)''' Unfolds the finals of the world tournament.

Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]]. Dae-Wi starts off the series as a hard-working young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, Dae-Wi participates to cure his friend of the disease. His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal. Il-Pyo later acts as an ally to Jin Mo-Ri and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability. The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms. These weapons range from swords to bats, knives, guns, even rocket launchers. National treasures can be given by gods the Power Borrower commune or made by artisans. All national treasures have the ability to chose its owner and grant him with a multitude of other abilities such as Teleportation, Levitation, Attack Enhancement, Charyeok Amplification....they each have a will of their own and chooses a master who is most worthy of them. \n\n== Setting ==\nIn GOH, the action takes place and involves the inhabitants of three different realms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Locations|title=GOH fandom/ information about locations|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>:\n\n'''The Human Realm:''' mainly populated by humans and identical to our known world.

It is populated by various mythical creatures, spirits, and monsters who are collectively known as Demons. In the hierarchy of worlds, it is higher than the Human Realm but lower than the Heavenly Realm. Nearly one thousand years ago, the Sage Realm and the Heavenly Realm had a war, which the Sage Realm lost.\n\n'''The''' '''Heavenly Realm''' (kor: \uc2e0\uacc4; hanja: \u795e\u754c,  lit. \"''Divine World''\").

The event, sponsored by a shady corporation, brings together people from high schools all over South Korea on a regional and then, national level in order to select three representatives for the World Tournament. As a prize, the winner gets his wish fulfilled by the hosting corporation, no question asked.\n\nThis intrigues Mo-Ri, and as he continues through the tournament, he meets many competitors each with a different way of fighting. Martial arts aside, participants fight by using \"Borrowed Power\" (or \"Charyeok\"in Korean), a mystical energy granted by supernatural entities (gods, demons, mythical creatures....), hence the name Borrowed Power. During the opening rounds, he comes across two other martial arts prodigies: [[Full contact karate|Full-Contact Karate]] expert Han Dae-Wi and [[Korean swordsmanship|epeeist]] master Yu Mi-Ra. These two would befriend Jin Mo-Ri after their fights with him, and will become teamed together after the preliminary rounds. As the tournaments preliminary rounds finish, and teams assemble, plans for many different people within the organization, and those pitted against them begin to make their moves to achieve their goals. \n\n=== Arcs<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://namu.wiki/w/%EA%B0%93%20%EC%98%A4%EB%B8%8C%20%ED%95%98%EC%9D%B4%EC%8A%A4%EC%BF%A8|title=Namuwiki|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> ===\n'''Arc 1: Round with Gods / (Episode 1 to 41)''' The start of the \"God of High School\" competition.\n\n'''Arc 2: National Tournament / (Episode 42 to 112)''' Depicts the battles between participants in the mid- and late national stages.\n\n'''Arc 2.5: Jin Tae-jin Story/ (Episode 113 to 118)''' Centers on Jin Tae-Jin's past during an infiltration mission in North Korea and how he adopted Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 3: Adventure / (Episode 119-172)''' \n\n'''Arc 4: World Championships / (Episode 173 to 216)''' The arc feature a consolation match and introduces the character of Hui Mo-Ri.\n\n'''Arc 5: Ragnarok / (Episode 217 to 307)''' Unfolds the finals of the world tournament.

Later in the series, after the mystical \"Borrowed Power\" is introduced Mo-Ri is labeled as a Genuine Fighter meaning he uses martial arts to fight rather than borrowing power from other beings. However, the reason Mo-Ri is so powerful is due to his true identity of the mythical [[Sun Wukong]], inspired by the Ancient Chinese Novel [[Journey to the West]] much like [[Goku]] from the [[Dragon Ball]] [[manga]] series.\n\n'''Han Dae-Wi:''' a 17-year-old martial artist from Seoul, South Korea who practices [[Kyokushin]] [[Karate]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He was taught the fighting style by the creator of the art himself [[Mas Oyama]]. Dae-Wi starts off the series as a hard-working young man who works to pay off his best friend's hospital bill due to terminal cancer. After being invited to the GOH tournament, Dae-Wi participates to cure his friend of the disease. His Borrowed Power is that of a [[Xiezhi|Haetae]], a mythical creature with the ability to control water as a defensive tool or a weapon as well as augmenting attacks.\n\n'''Yu Mi-Ra:''' a 17-year-old swordswoman from Seoul, South Korea and the 25th master of a fictitious sword style called the Moonlight Sword, (Korean: \uc6d4\uac15\ub3c4)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-6/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=6|title=The God of High School - Ep. 6|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> which emphasizes strong yet fluid attacks. She initially joins the GOH Tournament in order to fulfill her wish of finding a suitable husband to carry on the school bloodline. Mira's borrowed power is of an Ancient Chinese general named [[L\u00fc Bu]], which is loosely based on the historical figure of the same name. This power gives her several abilities such as enhanced strength and the ability to summon a red horse.\n\n=== GOH competitors ===\n'''Park Il-Pyo:''' a 18-year-old boy competing in the God of High School tournament. He is introduced as a cold and calculating fighter who uses a fictional version of the traditional Korean martial art of [[Taekkyeon|Taekkyon]] (\ud0dc\uaef8) called Ssamsu-Taekkyon (Korean: \uc308\uc218\ud0dd\uacac).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-58/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=58|title=The God of High School - Ep. 58|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> He competes alongside his cousin and fellow Taekkyon practitioner '''Park Seung-Ah''' in order to cure their relative Park Seung-Min who was crippled by Taek Jae-Kal. Il-Pyo later acts as an ally to Jin Mo-Ri and helps him through many hardships in the series. His Charyok is [[Kumiho]], the nine-tail fox of Eastern Asian folklore.\n\n'''Baek Seung-Cheol:''' a 18-year-old participant in the God of High School tournament who uses a metal [[baseball bat]] as a weapon. Seung-Cheol is of genius-level intellect and peak physical conditioning capable of predicting an opponent's movements and suddenly changing the direction of his swing. This makes his fighting style unorthodox and unpredictable for those he is fighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.webtoons.com/en/action/the-god-of-high-school/ep-17/viewer?title_no=66&episode_no=17|title=The God of High School - Ep. 17|website=www.webtoons.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}</ref> Later on in the series, Seung-Cheol gains the favor of the Oxen King and she becomes his borrowed power giving him increased strength, speed, and durability. The character of the Oxen King is a combination of characters from Journey to the West: Bull King and his wife [[Princess Iron Fan]].\n\n'''Taek Jae-Kal:''' main antagonist of the first and second arcs. Sold off as a baby by his mother to become the heir of the chairman of a large company, he grew up with a <nowiki>''</nowiki>Might is right<nowiki>''</nowiki> philosophy. Dubbed a monster by his opponents and team mates alike, Jae-Kal has an arrogant personality and extremely violent style of fighting, viewing everyone around him as insignificant trash. The exception being the guardian of Ssamsu-Taekkyon, Park Il-Pyo, his mortal enemy who was the only person to defeat him years prior to the GOH tournament. Jae-Kal's Charyeok is characterized by \"Greed\", allowing him to absorb other fighter's powers.  \n\n=== THE SIX ===\nAlso known as \"human cultural assets\" (cor: \uc778\uac04\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac) THE SIX are a group of people who are the highest level masters of their own fighting styles. They would gather every ten years to fight among themselves to get the title of \"special human cultural asset\" (aka the \"best fighter\"). \n\n'''Park Mu-Bong/Jin:''' main antagonist of the manhwa. Member of the Six and [[National Assembly (South Korea)|National Assembly of Korea]], he is the figure in charge of the God of High School tournament in South Korea. In the series, he acts as a mastermind by laying out plans to achieve his goal of obtaining power. His borrowed power is called \"Longinus' Hand\" which manifests as two yellow crosses appearing on each of Mu-Jin's hands. The name Longinus' Hand is loosely based on [[Longinus]] the Roman soldier said to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during the [[Crucifixion]], hence the crosses on the character's hands. Longinus' Hand allows him control over gravity and as a defensive shield.\n\n=== Others ===\n'''Jin Tae-Jin:''' the adoptive grandfather of series protagonist Jin Mo-Ri, and the man who taught Mo-Ri his specialty of Re-Taekwondo. Probably the strongest martial artist of the series, Tae-Jin is the creator and only master of the fictional Renewal Taekwondo. Also known as the <nowiki>''</nowiki>God of combat<nowiki>''</nowiki>, Tae-Jin defeated <nowiki>''</nowiki>The Six<nowiki>''</nowiki> without even resorting to borrowed power. As the captain of an elite group of soldiers sent on a mission to infiltrate [[North Korea]], he found an infant Mo-Ri encased within a transparent green shell and guarded by a giant bipedal ape-like humanoid. Being the only survivor of the mission, Tae-Jin returned home and raised Mo-Ri as his own family.\n\n== Fighting techniques ==\n\n'''Charyeok:''' (kor:\ucc28\ub825; hanja:\u501f\u529b; lit. \"''Borrowed Power''\"),Within the God of High School webtoon, humans are capable of making contracts with gods and other divine beings to borrow a piece of their power to enhance themselves physically and gain supernatural powers. Each divine or otherworldly lending different powers to their contractors or descendants, one example within the comic is Thor who gives his contractor Anna the ability to fly, superhuman strength, and speed. A select few individuals are allowed to make a \"Direct Contract\" with their divine being, lending the human more power and sometimes an item originally used by said figure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Charyeok|title=GOH fandom/Charyeok|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n'''Martial Arts:''' (kor: \ubb34\ud22c; hanja \u6b66\u95d8; lit. \"''Mutu''\"), Martial arts are codified systems of human combat practices for self-defence, competition, health and physical fitness, entertainment, as well as for mental, physical and spiritual development...Unlike the Charyeok, which borrows the capacities of a supernatural entity, martial arts rely entirely on the physical, mental and technical skills of their user. The Manhwa gives prominence to martial arts, some of which are inspired by real-life styles.\n\n'''National Treasures''' are items from human history endowed with tremendous power. There are different types of National Treasures and, as such, they each have a different appearance. Some of the treasures are even capable of changing their forms. These weapons range from swords to bats, knives, guns, even rocket launchers. National treasures can be given by gods the Power Borrower commune or made by artisans. All national treasures have the ability to chose its owner and grant him with a multitude of other abilities such as Teleportation, Levitation, Attack Enhancement, Charyeok Amplification....they each have a will of their own and chooses a master who is most worthy of them. \n\n== Setting ==\nIn GOH, the action takes place and involves the inhabitants of three different realms<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Locations|title=GOH fandom/ information about locations|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>:\n\n'''The Human Realm:''' mainly populated by humans and identical to our known world.

The film stars the voices of [[Gabriel Damon]], Candace Hutson, [[Judith Barsi]] and [[Will Ryan]] with narration provided by [[Pat Hingle]].\n\nProduced by the American companies [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Lucasfilm]], and the American-Irish [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Sullivan Bluth Ltd.]], it features [[dinosaur]]s living in the prehistoric times. The plot concerns a young \"Longneck\" (''[[Apatosaurus]]'') named Littlefoot, who is orphaned<ref name=\"Lenburg2009\">{{cite book|last=Lenburg|first=Jeff|title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |edition=Third|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6599-8}}</ref> when his mother is killed by a vicious carnivore. Littlefoot flees [[famine]] and upheaval to search for the Great Valley, an area spared from devastation. On his journey, he meets four young companions: Cera the \"Threehorn\" (''[[Triceratops]]''), Ducky the \"Bigmouth\" (''[[Saurolophus]]''), Petrie the \"Flyer\" (''[[Pteranodon]]''), and Spike the \"Spiketail\" (''[[Stegosaurus]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uphe.com/movies/the-land-before-time |title=The Land Before Time |publisher=Universal Pictures Entertainment |accessdate=October 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film explores issues of prejudice between the different species and the hardships they endure in their journey as they are guided by the spirit of Littlefoot's mother and forced to deal with a \"Sharptooth\" (''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''). This is the only Don Bluth film of the 1980s in which [[Dom DeLuise]] did not participate (instead, he starred in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' that same year), and the only film in ''The Land Before Time'' series that is not a musical, as well as the only one to be released theatrically worldwide.\nReleased by [[Universal Pictures]] on November 18, 1988, the first film spawned [[The Land Before Time (franchise)|a franchise]] with thirteen [[direct-to-video]] sequels and [[The Land Before Time (TV series)|a television series]] and merchandise, none of which had Bluth, Spielberg or Lucas' involvement.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- READ THIS BEFORE EDITING! Per WP:FILMPLOT, feature film plot summaries should be 400 to 700 words only! -->\nDuring the [[Mesozoic|age of the dinosaurs]], a massive famine forces several herds of dinosaurs to seek an [[oasis]] known as the Great Valley. Among these, a mother in a diminished \"longneck\" herd gives birth to a single baby, named Littlefoot. Years later, Littlefoot plays with Cera, a \"three-horn\", until her father intervenes and tells her that three-horns don't play with longnecks, whereupon Littlefoot's mother describes the different kinds of dinosaurs: \"three-horns\", \"spike-tails\", \"swimmers\", and \"flyers\". That night, as Littlefoot follows a \"[[Triadobatrachus|hopper]]\", he encounters Cera again, and they play together briefly until a large \"[[Tyrannosaurus|Sharptooth]]\" attacks them. Littlefoot's mother comes to their rescue, but receives fatal injuries in the process. An earthquake swallows up the Sharptooth and divides Littlefoot and Cera and other dinosaurs from their herds while some die in the process, including Littlefoot's mother, who gives her son some words of advice about finding the Great Valley before she dies that night. Confused and in grief, Littlefoot meets an old \"[[Scolosaurus|clubtail]]\" named Rooter, who consoles him. He is then guided by his mother's voice telling him to follow the sun to the Great Valley and pass several landmarks, such as a rock formation that resembles a Longneck and the \"[[volcano|Mountains that Burn]]\".\n\nLater, Littlefoot meets a \"bigmouth\" named Ducky and a \"flyer\" named Petrie, who accompany him on his journey. Cera, who is attempting to find her own kind, finds the unconscious Sharptooth inside a ravine and mistakenly wakes him up. She escapes and bumps into Littlefoot, Ducky, and Petrie; she tells them that the Sharptooth is alive and pursuing them, but Littlefoot does not believe her. As Cera describes her encounter, she accidentally flings Ducky to the direction of a lone hatching \"spiketail\", whom she names Spike and inducts into the group. Seeking the Great Valley, they discover a cluster of trees, which is abruptly depleted by a herd of Longnecks. Searching for remaining growth, they discover a single leaf-bearing tree, and obtain food by stacking up atop each other and pulling it down. Cera remains aloof, but at nightfall, everyone including herself gravitates to Littlefoot's side for warmth and companionship.\n\nThe next morning, they are attacked by the Sharptooth, but they manage to escape through a tunnel that is too small for him to follow. Beyond this, they discover the landmarks mentioned by Littlefoot's mother. Cera stubbornly decides to go another way, but Littlefoot, fed up with Cera's stubbornness, refuses, and their ensuing fight leads to a schism that divides him from the others. However, when Ducky and Spike become endangered by lava, Petrie gets stuck in a [[tar pit]], and Cera gets ambushed by a pack of \"domeheads\" (''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'') who are also living in the Mountains that Burn, Littlefoot returns to rescue them. He, along with Ducky, Petrie and Spike, pose as a tar monster, scaring Cera out of her wits. When she realizes who it really is, she storms off in a huff. It is not long, however, until she gives in to her guilt, being that her stubbornness put others in danger for her own selfish desires, and the imagined shame she would receive from her father. Later, while crossing a pond, Petrie overhears the Sharptooth nearby. The group devises a scheme to lure him to the pond and drown him in the deep side using a nearby boulder. During the ensuing struggle, a draft from the Sharptooth's nostrils enables Petrie to fly for the first time.\n\nThe plan nearly fails when the Sharptooth begins attacking the boulder while the group attempts to push it onto him. However, Cera reunites with the group, and she headbutts the boulder, causing the Sharptooth to fall into the water below with the boulder falling on him in the process. The Sharptooth momentarily takes Petrie down with him to his death, but he later emerges unharmed. Littlefoot, alone, follows a cloud resembling his mother, which guides him to the Great Valley. He is then joined by the others. Upon arrival, the five are reunited with their families: Petrie impresses his family with his newfound flight; Ducky introduces Spike to her family, who adopt him; Cera reunites with her father; and Littlefoot rejoins with his grandparents. The group then rejoins at the top of a hill and embrace each other in a hug.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Land Before Time characters}}\n* [[Gabriel Damon]] as Littlefoot\n* Candace Hutson as Cera\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Ducky\n* [[Will Ryan]] as Petrie\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Littlefoot's mother\n* [[Burke Byrnes]] as Cera's father\n* [[Bill Erwin]] as Littlefoot's grandfather\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Narrator and Rooter\n\n== Production ==\nDuring production of ''[[An American Tail]]'', talk began of the next feature with Steven Spielberg. Spielberg wanted to do a film similar to ''[[Bambi]]'', but with only dinosaurs. George Lucas was also brought in on the project. An early working title for the film was ''The Land Before Time Began''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink= |year=1987 |publisher=New American Library |location= |isbn=0-452-25993-2 |pages=354 }}</ref> Spielberg and Lucas originally wanted the film to have no dialogue, like ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' sequence in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', but the idea was abandoned in favor of using voice actors in order to make it appealing to children.<ref name=\"AFDB\">{{cite book |title= The Animated Films of Don Bluth |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html |author=Cawley, Jon |date=October 1991 |publisher=Image Pub of New York |isbn=0-685-50334-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Editing ===\nThroughout production, ''The Land Before Time'' underwent a severe cutting and editing of footage. Spielberg and Lucas thought that some scenes in the movie would appear too dark and intense for young children. Spielberg told Bluth while looking at the scenes from the film, \"It's too scary. We'll have kids crying in the lobby, and a lot of angry parents. You don't want that.\" About 10 minutes of footage, comprising a total of 19 fully animated scenes, were cut from the final film, to attain a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|G rating]] instead of a PG rating. Much of the cut footage consisted of the ''Tyrannosaurus'' attack sequence and sequences of the five young dinosaurs in grave danger and distress. Examples can be seen in the storyboards of the chase sequence in the briar patch. POV shots of Sharptooth's snapping jaws were deleted, and shots were rearranged to shorten the sequence.<ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/04/don-bluth-storyboards-2-land-before.html Part 1 \u2013 Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref> This results in continuity errors, depicting the Tyrannosaur with his right eye still open after it had been blinded.<ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/06/part-2-don-bluth-storyboards-land.html Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref><ref>http://markpudleiner.blogspot.ca/2015/10/part-3-don-bluth-storyboards-land.html Don Bluth \u2013 Storyboards \u2013 The Land Before Time \u2013 Tyrannosaurus Attack</ref> Some screams were re-voiced using milder exclamations.<ref name=\"AFDB\" />\n\n=== Music and soundtrack ===\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = The Land Before Time Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n| type       = Soundtrack\n| artist     = Various Artists\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = November 21, 1988<ref name=Amazon>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002O5Q |title=James Horner, Diana Ross \u2013 The Land Before Time |accessdate=October 20, 2015 }}</ref>\n| recorded   =\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = Soundtrack\n| length     = 57:49\n| label      = [[MCA Records]] (1988)<br />[[Geffen Records]] (2013)\n| producer   = [[James Horner]]\n| chronology = Don Bluth Music of Films\n| prev_title = [[An American Tail]]\n| prev_year  = 1986\n| next_title = [[All Dogs Go to Heaven]]\n| next_year  = 1989\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = The Land Before Time Original Motion Picture Soundtrack\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = [[If We Hold on Together]]\n | single1date = January 21, 1989\n}}\n}}\nThe music for ''The Land Before Time'' was composed by [[James Horner]], who had previously provided the soundtrack for ''An American Tail'', and performed by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge|Choir of King's College]].

The film stars the voices of [[Gabriel Damon]], Candace Hutson, [[Judith Barsi]] and [[Will Ryan]] with narration provided by [[Pat Hingle]].\n\nProduced by the American companies [[Amblin Entertainment]] and [[Lucasfilm]], and the American-Irish [[Sullivan Bluth Studios|Sullivan Bluth Ltd.]], it features [[dinosaur]]s living in the prehistoric times. The plot concerns a young \"Longneck\" (''[[Apatosaurus]]'') named Littlefoot, who is orphaned<ref name=\"Lenburg2009\">{{cite book|last=Lenburg|first=Jeff|title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |edition=Third|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6599-8}}</ref> when his mother is killed by a vicious carnivore. Littlefoot flees [[famine]] and upheaval to search for the Great Valley, an area spared from devastation. On his journey, he meets four young companions: Cera the \"Threehorn\" (''[[Triceratops]]''), Ducky the \"Bigmouth\" (''[[Saurolophus]]''), Petrie the \"Flyer\" (''[[Pteranodon]]''), and Spike the \"Spiketail\" (''[[Stegosaurus]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uphe.com/movies/the-land-before-time |title=The Land Before Time |publisher=Universal Pictures Entertainment |accessdate=October 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe film explores issues of prejudice between the different species and the hardships they endure in their journey as they are guided by the spirit of Littlefoot's mother and forced to deal with a \"Sharptooth\" (''[[Tyrannosaurus rex]]''). This is the only Don Bluth film of the 1980s in which [[Dom DeLuise]] did not participate (instead, he starred in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s ''[[Oliver & Company]]'' that same year), and the only film in ''The Land Before Time'' series that is not a musical, as well as the only one to be released theatrically worldwide.\nReleased by [[Universal Pictures]] on November 18, 1988, the first film spawned [[The Land Before Time (franchise)|a franchise]] with thirteen [[direct-to-video]] sequels and [[The Land Before Time (TV series)|a television series]] as well as merchandise.\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- READ THIS BEFORE EDITING! Per WP:FILMPLOT, feature film plot summaries should be 400 to 700 words only! -->\nDuring the [[Mesozoic|age of the dinosaurs]], a massive famine forces several herds of dinosaurs to seek an [[oasis]] known as the Great Valley. Among these, a mother in a diminished \"longneck\" herd gives birth to a single baby, named Littlefoot. Years later, Littlefoot plays with Cera, a \"three-horn\", until her father intervenes and tells her that three-horns don't play with longnecks, whereupon Littlefoot's mother describes the different kinds of dinosaurs: \"three-horns\", \"spike-tails\", \"swimmers\", and \"flyers\". That night, as Littlefoot follows a \"[[Triadobatrachus|hopper]]\", he encounters Cera again, and they play together briefly until a large \"[[Tyrannosaurus|Sharptooth]]\" attacks them. Littlefoot's mother comes to their rescue, but receives fatal injuries in the process. An earthquake swallows up the Sharptooth and divides Littlefoot and Cera and other dinosaurs from their herds while some die in the process, including Littlefoot's mother, who gives her son some words of advice about finding the Great Valley before she dies that night. Confused and in grief, Littlefoot meets an old \"[[Scolosaurus|clubtail]]\" named Rooter, who consoles him. He is then guided by his mother's voice telling him to follow the sun to the Great Valley and pass several landmarks, such as a rock formation that resembles a Longneck and the \"[[volcano|Mountains that Burn]]\".\n\nLater, Littlefoot meets a \"bigmouth\" named Ducky and a \"flyer\" named Petrie, who accompany him on his journey. Cera, who is attempting to find her own kind, finds the unconscious Sharptooth inside a ravine and mistakenly wakes him up. She escapes and bumps into Littlefoot, Ducky, and Petrie; she tells them that the Sharptooth is alive and pursuing them, but Littlefoot does not believe her. As Cera describes her encounter, she accidentally flings Ducky to the direction of a lone hatching \"spiketail\", whom she names Spike and inducts into the group. Seeking the Great Valley, they discover a cluster of trees, which is abruptly depleted by a herd of Longnecks. Searching for remaining growth, they discover a single leaf-bearing tree, and obtain food by stacking up atop each other and pulling it down. Cera remains aloof, but at nightfall, everyone including herself gravitates to Littlefoot's side for warmth and companionship.\n\nThe next morning, they are attacked by the Sharptooth, but they manage to escape through a tunnel that is too small for him to follow. Beyond this, they discover the landmarks mentioned by Littlefoot's mother. Cera stubbornly decides to go another way, but Littlefoot, fed up with Cera's stubbornness, refuses, and their ensuing fight leads to a schism that divides him from the others. However, when Ducky and Spike become endangered by lava, Petrie gets stuck in a [[tar pit]], and Cera gets ambushed by a pack of \"domeheads\" (''[[Pachycephalosaurus]]'') who are also living in the Mountains that Burn, Littlefoot returns to rescue them. He, along with Ducky, Petrie and Spike, pose as a tar monster, scaring Cera out of her wits. When she realizes who it really is, she storms off in a huff. It is not long, however, until she gives in to her guilt, being that her stubbornness put others in danger for her own selfish desires, and the imagined shame she would receive from her father. Later, while crossing a pond, Petrie overhears the Sharptooth nearby. The group devises a scheme to lure him to the pond and drown him in the deep side using a nearby boulder. During the ensuing struggle, a draft from the Sharptooth's nostrils enables Petrie to fly for the first time.\n\nThe plan nearly fails when the Sharptooth begins attacking the boulder while the group attempts to push it onto him. However, Cera reunites with the group, and she headbutts the boulder, causing the Sharptooth to fall into the water below with the boulder falling on him in the process. The Sharptooth momentarily takes Petrie down with him to his death, but he later emerges unharmed. Littlefoot, alone, follows a cloud resembling his mother, which guides him to the Great Valley. He is then joined by the others. Upon arrival, the five are reunited with their families: Petrie impresses his family with his newfound flight; Ducky introduces Spike to her family, who adopt him; Cera reunites with her father; and Littlefoot rejoins with his grandparents. The group then rejoins at the top of a hill and embrace each other in a hug.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Main|List of The Land Before Time characters}}\n* [[Gabriel Damon]] as Littlefoot\n* Candace Hutson as Cera\n* [[Judith Barsi]] as Ducky\n* [[Will Ryan]] as Petrie\n* [[Helen Shaver]] as Littlefoot's mother\n* [[Burke Byrnes]] as Cera's father\n* [[Bill Erwin]] as Littlefoot's grandfather\n* [[Pat Hingle]] as Narrator and Rooter\n\n== Production ==\nDuring production of ''[[An American Tail]]'', talk began of the next feature with Steven Spielberg. Spielberg wanted to do a film similar to ''[[Bambi]]'', but with only dinosaurs. George Lucas was also brought in on the project. An early working title for the film was ''The Land Before Time Began''.<ref>{{cite book |title=Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink= |year=1987 |publisher=New American Library |location= |isbn=0-452-25993-2 |pages=354 }}</ref> Spielberg and Lucas originally wanted the film to have no dialogue, like ''[[The Rite of Spring]]'' sequence in ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', but the idea was abandoned in favor of using voice actors in order to make it appealing to children.<ref name=\"AFDB\">{{cite book |title= The Animated Films of Don Bluth |url=http://www.cataroo.com/DBland.html |author=Cawley, Jon |date=October 1991 |publisher=Image Pub of New York |isbn=0-685-50334-8}}</ref>\n\n=== Editing ===\nThroughout production, ''The Land Before Time'' underwent a severe cutting and editing of footage. Spielberg and Lucas thought that some scenes in the movie would appear too dark and intense for young children. Spielberg told Bluth while looking at the scenes from the film, \"It's too scary. We'll have kids crying in the lobby, and a lot of angry parents. You don't want that.\" About 10 minutes of footage, comprising a total of 19 fully animated scenes, were cut from the final film, to attain a [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|G rating]] instead of a PG rating.

Over the course of the battle, the Loyalist fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelist fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelist four, managed to close with the Miguelists, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelist fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelist fleet.<ref name=\"RG01\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG02\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelist crews proved no match for the Loyalist crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelist fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelist fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]]. The Miguelist-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.<ref name=\"RG03\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG04\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==Background==\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Loyalist Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as [[Admiral]] of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]].<ref name=\"RG05\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG06\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as [[Vice Admiral]], Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Loyalists to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelists forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]]. After successfully [[Landing operation|disembarking]] this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelist admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelist fleet.<ref name=\"RG07\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG08\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelist fleet. The Miguelist fleet significantly outnumbered the Loyalist one, and aimed to defeat the Loyalists via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as [[tugs]], but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns.<ref name=\"RG09\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG10\">Napier, (1995)</ref>\n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelist vessels and attempt to [[Naval boarding|board]] and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his [[flagship]] leading the [[Sailing ship tactics|manoeuvre]], the Loyalist fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelist fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelists desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Loyalist victory was that the majority of the Loyalist crews were British [[veterans]] from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelist fleet. In the battle the Loyalist forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Loyalist cause and swear allegiance to [[Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed, including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains, and about 60 wounded, including Charles Elers Napier, against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelist fleet, including the Admiral of the Miguelist fleet, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros.<ref name=\"RG11\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG12\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelist fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Loyalist fleet and the captured Miguelist prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelistas had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Loyalist victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Navy List at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]].<ref name=\"RG13\">Napier, (1836)</ref><ref name=\"RG14\">Napier, (1995)</ref> \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent in the [[Peerage of Portugal]]. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelist ''The Lord of the Isles'' steamer at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Loyalist cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Loyalist and Miguelist armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Loyalist victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelist army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal. [[Pedro IV of Portugal|Dom Pedro]] restored the Constitutional Charter, but he passed away on September 24, 1834.

'''Battle of Cape St Vincent''' was a naval encounter off [[Cape St. Vincent]] between a Loyalist fleet under the command of British naval officer [[Charles Napier (naval officer)|Charles Napier]] against a [[Miguelist]] fleet under the command of Portugese naval officer Manuel Marreiros, which was fought on 5 July 1833 during the [[Liberal Wars]] and resulted in a decisive victory for the Loyalist fleet. Over the course of the battle, the Loyalist fleet, despite being significantly outnumbered by the Miguelist fleet and lacking any [[ships of the line]] when compared to the Miguelist four, managed to close with the Miguelists, [[naval boarding|board]] their ships and engage in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. The early exchange of cannon fire between the two fleets went on for some time before Napier decided that his numerically inferior squadron could not last long against the Miguelist fleet, and sailed his ships directly towards the Miguelist fleet. \n\nThis decision by Napier was the deciding factor in the outcome of the battle, and the Miguelist crews proved no match for the Loyalist crews, most of them being former [[Royal Navy]] personnel that had been discharged and sought service under [[Pedro I of Brazil]]. Four ships of the line, one [[frigate]] and one [[corvette]] was captured, and the remainder of the Miguelist fleet retreated. The action took place in context of the [[Liberal Wars]], a Portugese civil war fought between the King of Portugal, Dom Pedro, and a [[pretender]] named [[Don Miguel]], whose supporters were called [[Miguelist|Miguelites]].  The battle had a decisive effect on the war, since the Miguelist fleet at Cape St.Vincent was the last significant naval force that Don Miguel could muster, his other naval forces being lost in the [[Battle of the Tagus]] on 11 July 1831 against a [[July Monarchy|French]] fleet led by [[Albin Roussin]]. The Miguelist-held [[Lisbon]], deprived of any chance to be resupplied via the sea, quickly capitulated.\n\n==Background==\nWhilst serving in the Royal Navy near the [[Azores]], Napier had become acquainted with some exiled [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Liberalism|liberals]], who had offered him command of the small fleet that Dom Pedro had under his command. The fleet at that point largely consisted of a few aging frigates and corvettes, along with some [[East Indiamen]] purchased from the British. In February 1833, Napier, wishing to have a chance to see combat again, accepted their proposals to become head of the Loyalist Fleet and replaced another British officer, Captain [[George Rose Sartorius]], who was already serving as [[Admiral]] of Pedro's navy before deciding to rescind his position. Napier gave himself a nom-de-guerre, 'Carlos de Ponza', in a transparent attempt to disguise his true identity as a British officer when enlisting. The name 'Carlos de Ponza', meaning Charles of Ponza in [[English language|English]], was a deliberate reference to one of Napier's most daring feats in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] when he captured the French-held island of [[Ponza]] in the Mediterranean in 1813. The reasoning behind the name change was to escape the penalties under the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1819 which forbade British citizens to enlist in the armed forces of a foreign nation. In June 1833, Napier joined his new command in the [[Douro]] River off [[Oporto]]. \n\nDom Pedro, who was currently trapped and besieged in [[Oporto]] by the forces of Dom Miguel, bestowed on Napier his commission as [[Vice Admiral]], Major General of the [[Portuguese Navy]] and Commander in Chief of the fleet. An eccentric but indomitable character, Napier restored order among the fleet, which had been close to mutiny due to lack of pay, and proposed a new strategy to break the siege. Flying his flag in the [[frigate]] ''Rainha de Portugal'', commanded by Captain F.G. MacDonough and with his stepson [[Charles Elers Napier]] as Chief of Staff, on 20 June he set sail from Oporto with his small fleet. The initial aim for Napier was to transport the [[Ant\u00f3nio Severim de Noronha|Duke of Terceira]] and half the total armed forces available to the Loyalists to the [[Algarve]] so that they could open a second front in the south of the country against the Miguelists forces and march on and capture [[Lisbon]]. After successfully [[Landing operation|disembarking]] this force, on the return voyage he encountered the considerably superior fleet of Dom Miguel under the command of Miguelist admiral Manuel Marreiros off [[Cape St. Vincent]] on 3 July 1833, and after two days of manoeuvring in calm and very light winds he engaged the Miguelist fleet.\n\n==The battle==\nAfter two days of manoeuvring in very favourable conditions, Napier\u2019s force was positions to engage the Miguelist fleet. The Miguelist fleet significantly outnumbered the Loyalist one, and aimed to defeat the Loyalists via superior firepower. Both fleets were essentially the remnants of the Portugese navy that had fought in the Napoleonic Wars, being divided during the outbreak of war. Napier's squadron consisted of six ships: three frigates, a [[corvette]], a [[brig]] and a [[schooner]], mounting a total of 176 guns. He had some small steamers under his command which he hoped to use as [[tugs]], but they abandoned him while the two forces were becalmed on the 4th of July: thus the subsequent battle was perhaps the last significant naval engagement during the Age of Sail that was entirely fought by sailing ships. On 5 July, the wind eventually changed to allow Napier's ships to move forwards, and at 4.00 p.m. he engaged the [[Miguelites|Miguelite]] fleet which consisted four [[ships of the line]], a frigate, a [[xebec]], three corvettes and a brig, mounting altogether 372 guns. \n\nAs the fighting commenced, it was clear that Napier could not match Marreiros in terms of firepower, and if the battle continued like this his fleet would be defeated in short order. Knowing that his ships could not continue to sustain a cannonade from such a superior opponent, Napier ordered his ships to sail directly towards the Miguelist vessels and attempt to [[Naval boarding|board]] and capture them in hand-to-hand combat. With his [[flagship]] leading the [[Sailing ship tactics|manoeuvre]], the Loyalist fleet sailed next to the ships of the line of the Miguelist fleet and managed to board them, with fierce hand-to-hand fighting ensuing as the Miguelists desperately but fruitlessly attempted to repel the boarders. After this, the battle was practically decided; all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette were easily overpowered and captured. A major reason for the Loyalist victory was that the majority of the Loyalist crews were British [[veterans]] from the Royal Navy who were far better trained and equipped than the inexperienced and ill-equipped Portugese crew of the Miguelist fleet. In the battle the Loyalist forces captured all four ships of the line, a frigate and a corvette, whose surviving crews agreed to fight for the Loyalist cause and swear allegiance to [[Don Pedro]]. The remaining Miguelite fleet, seeing their position, fled either to Lisbon or [[Madeira]]. Napier\u2019s losses were about 30 killed, including the captain of ''Rainha de Portugal'' and two other captains, and about 60 wounded, including Charles Elers Napier, against 300 killed and wounded aboard the Miguelist fleet, including the Admiral of the Miguelist fleet, Manuel Ant\u00f3nio Marreiros. \n\n==Aftermath==\nSome time after the conclusion of the battle, the sailors of his fleet became ravaged by [[cholera]] outbreak which was raging on in mainland Portugal, with an appalling loss of life among the crews of his fleet resulting in more deaths from cholera amongst his men than from combat against the Miguelist fleet. Despite this, Napier was able to bring the Loyalist fleet and the captured Miguelist prizes safely into Lisbon, which the Miguelistas had precipitately abandoned after being defeated by Terceira\u2019s army advancing from the south at the [[Battle of Almada]], a major Loyalist victory. On 6 July, receiving news of the victory, Dom Pedro named Napier as Viscount Cape St Vincent in the [[peerage of Portugal]]. Napier visited Rear-Admiral [[William Parker (admiral)|Sir William Parker]] who happened to be in the vicinity of the [[Tagus]], and was received according to his Portuguese rank as an Admiral. Though he was subsequently struck off the Navy List at the insistence of the [[July Monarchy|French]], he was restored to his rank in the Royal Navy within two years and the battle, largely won by British officers and crews , was viewed in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] as maintaining the honour of the Royal Navy, which had reached the height of its success during the preceding [[Napoleonic Wars]]. \n\nContinuing his Portuguese services, Napier commanded land forces in the successful defence of Lisbon on September of 1833.  For these services he was made [[Order of the Tower and Sword|Grand Commander of the Tower and Sword]], and Count of the Cape of Saint Vincent in the [[Peerage of Portugal]]. On 12 September 1833, he captured the Miguelist ''The Lord of the Isles'' steamer at [[S\u00e3o Martinho (Funchal)|Sao Martinho]] and in 1836 defended his prize in the [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Court of Common Pleas]]. In 1834, with a small army made up largely of British sailors, he reconquered the [[Entre Douro e Minho|Minho]] region for the Loyalist cause. In the meantime, the [[Battle of Asseiceira]], fought between the Loyalist and Miguelist armies on May 16, 1834, resulted in a decisive Loyalist victory, putting an end to the Liberal Wars.  The Miguelist army was still formidable, numbering about roughly 18,000 men, but on May 24, 1834, at [[Evoramonte]], a peace treaty was signed under a concession by which [[Miguel I of Portugal|Dom Miguel]] formally renounced all claims to the throne of [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], was guaranteed an annual pension, and permanently exiled from Portugal.

Maria da Gl\u00f3ria resumed her interrupted reign as [[Maria II of Portugal]], until she finally passed away in 1853.\n\nAfter the final defeat of Miguel and the death of Dom Pedro shortly afterwards, Napier found himself frustrated in his attempts to reform the naval administration of Portugal and returned to England. His departure was followed by a vote of thanks to him in both houses of the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|restored Portuguese parliament]]. Napier unsuccessfully contested the Portsmouth [[Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|parliamentary]] seat for a second time in the by-election of December 1834.
