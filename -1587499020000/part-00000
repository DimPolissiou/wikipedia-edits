The uprising was crushed but Robert must have remained in favour with the Angevin Kings, as Richard would later be instrumental in his appointment as Grand Master.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He contributed money to French monastic houses in 1190 as a way of making amends.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Third Crusade===\nAccording to the [[''Gesta Regis Ricardi'']] Robert was one of the chosen leaders of the Crusading Fleet of Richard I that departed from Dartmouth in the spring of 1190. The fleet scattered in the sea of Bisquay a result of a storm and arrived at different times to the Portuguese port of Lisbon. One of this groups was involved helping the Portuguese monarch [[Sancho I of Portugal|Sancho I]] repealed an Almohad attack against the city of Santarem, while another went on a rampage against the local Jews and Muslims in the Christian controlled city of Lisbon. Robert arrived as the Portuguese monarch captured the misbehaved crusaders and was forced to swear an oath to control his forces while in Portuguese territory.<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, \"Revisi\u00f3n de la cr\u00f3nicas\", p. 167, n. 91.</ref>\n\nDespite only having a short tenure, Sabl\u00e9's reign was filled with successful campaigning. Before his election as Grand Master, he led King Richard I's navy from England and Normandy to the Mediterranean, getting involved in the [[Reconquista]] in the passage. The combined might of Richard the Lionheart's strategy, seasoned troops, and the elite Templar knights scored many victories. During the [[Third Crusade]], they laid siege to the city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], which soon fell. Throughout August 1191, they also recaptured many [[fortress]]es and cities along the [[Levant]]ine coast in the Eastern Mediterranean, which had been lost previously.\n\nThe new coalition's finest hour was the [[Battle of Arsuf]], on 7 September 1191. [[Saladin]]'s Muslim forces appeared to have become far stronger than the Christians, and a decisive victory was desperately needed. Pooling all of the crusaders' strength, the [[Knights Hospitaller]] joined the ranks, plus many knights from Sabl\u00e9's native Anjou, [[Maine (province)|Maine]], and [[Brittany]]. They met Saladin's troops on the dry plains and soon broke his ranks. Those who stayed to fight were killed, and the remaining Islamic troops were forced to retreat.\n\n==Acquisition of Cyprus==\nAt the end of 1191, Richard the Lionheart agreed to sell [[Cyprus]] to the Templars for 25,000 pieces of silver. Richard had plundered the island from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] forces of the tyrant [[Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus]] some months earlier and had no real use for it. The [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]] would later establish solid bases on the islands of [[Rhodes]] and [[Malta]], but Sabl\u00e9 failed to do the same with the island of Cyprus. He was lord for two years, until he gave (or sold) the island to [[Guy de Lusignan]], [[King of Jerusalem]], as he was without a kingdom.\n\nSabl\u00e9 did manage to establish a Chieftain House of the Order in [[Saint-Jean d'Acre]], which remained for almost a century.\n\n==Delayed election==\nSabl\u00e9 was lucky to have been Grand Master at all, as at the time of [[Gerard de Ridefort]]'s death, he was not even a member of the Templar Order. However, the senior knights had become increasingly opposed to Masters fighting on the front line, and the capture and beheading of Grand Master Gerard de Ridefort became the final straw. They delayed elections for over a year so that the rules regarding active service of Grand Masters could be reviewed. During this hiatus, Sabl\u00e9 did join the order, just in time to be considered for election. When he was made Grand Master, he had been a Templar knight for less than a year. He died in 1193.<ref name=Barber/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nRobert de Sabl\u00e9 is a character in the 2007 video game ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]''.

Although there are no exact records of his birth date, it is believed that he was relatively old at the time of his death compared to the average life expectancy of the 12th century.<ref>{{cite book |title=Vitae paparum avenionensium : hoc est Historia pontificum romanorum qui in Gallia sederunt ab anno Christi MCCCV usque ad annum MCCCXCIV |url=https://archive.org/stream/vitaepaparumaven02balu#page/ |last=Baluze |first=Etienne |author-link=Etienne Baluze |last2=Mollat |first2=Guillaume |author2-link=Guillaume Mollat |year=1914 |publisher=Letouzey et An\u00e9 |location=Paris |volume=2 |pages=1034}}</ref>\n\n==Military record==\n\n===Angevin Civil War===\nIn 1173, Sabl\u00e9 supported [[Henry the Young King]], heir apparent to the throne of the Kingdom of England and duchy of Normandy, in a revolt against his father [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] during the [[Revolt of 1173-1174]]. The uprising was crushed but Robert must have remained in favour with the Angevin Kings, as Richard would later be instrumental in his appointment as Grand Master.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He contributed money to French monastic houses in 1190 as a way of making amends.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n===Third Crusade===\nAccording to the [[''Gesta Regis Ricardi'']] Robert was one of the chosen leaders of the Crusading Fleet of Richard I that departed from Dartmouth in the spring of 1190. The fleet scattered in the sea of Bisquay a result of a storm and arrived at different times to the Portuguese port of Lisbon. One of this groups was involved helping the Portuguese monarch [[Sancho I]] repealed an Almohad attack against the city of Santarem, while another went on a rampage against the local Jews and Muslims in the Christian controlled city of Lisbon. Robert arrived as the Portuguese monarch captured the misbehaved crusaders and was forced to swear an oath to control his forces while in Portuguese territory.<ref>Villegas-Aristiz\u00e1bal, \"Revisi\u00f3n de la cr\u00f3nicas\", p. 167, n. 91.</ref>\n\nDespite only having a short tenure, Sabl\u00e9's reign was filled with successful campaigning. Before his election as Grand Master, he led King Richard I's navy from England and Normandy to the Mediterranean, getting involved in the [[Reconquista]] in the passage. The combined might of Richard the Lionheart's strategy, seasoned troops, and the elite Templar knights scored many victories. During the [[Third Crusade]], they laid siege to the city of [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], which soon fell. Throughout August 1191, they also recaptured many [[fortress]]es and cities along the [[Levant]]ine coast in the Eastern Mediterranean, which had been lost previously.\n\nThe new coalition's finest hour was the [[Battle of Arsuf]], on 7 September 1191. [[Saladin]]'s Muslim forces appeared to have become far stronger than the Christians, and a decisive victory was desperately needed. Pooling all of the crusaders' strength, the [[Knights Hospitaller]] joined the ranks, plus many knights from Sabl\u00e9's native Anjou, [[Maine (province)|Maine]], and [[Brittany]]. They met Saladin's troops on the dry plains and soon broke his ranks. Those who stayed to fight were killed, and the remaining Islamic troops were forced to retreat.\n\n==Acquisition of Cyprus==\nAt the end of 1191, Richard the Lionheart agreed to sell [[Cyprus]] to the Templars for 25,000 pieces of silver. Richard had plundered the island from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] forces of the tyrant [[Isaac Comnenus of Cyprus]] some months earlier and had no real use for it. The [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]] would later establish solid bases on the islands of [[Rhodes]] and [[Malta]], but Sabl\u00e9 failed to do the same with the island of Cyprus. He was lord for two years, until he gave (or sold) the island to [[Guy de Lusignan]], [[King of Jerusalem]], as he was without a kingdom.\n\nSabl\u00e9 did manage to establish a Chieftain House of the Order in [[Saint-Jean d'Acre]], which remained for almost a century.\n\n==Delayed election==\nSabl\u00e9 was lucky to have been Grand Master at all, as at the time of [[Gerard de Ridefort]]'s death, he was not even a member of the Templar Order. However, the senior knights had become increasingly opposed to Masters fighting on the front line, and the capture and beheading of Grand Master Gerard de Ridefort became the final straw. They delayed elections for over a year so that the rules regarding active service of Grand Masters could be reviewed. During this hiatus, Sabl\u00e9 did join the order, just in time to be considered for election. When he was made Grand Master, he had been a Templar knight for less than a year. He died in 1193.<ref name=Barber/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n\nRobert de Sabl\u00e9 is a character in the 2007 video game ''[[Assassin's Creed (video game)|Assassin's Creed]]''. He is presented as the leader of the [[Knights Templar]] within the game's story and a loyal to King Richard.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/community/2013/09/27/history-behind-the-game-assassins-creed-characters/ |title=History Behind the Game \u2013 Assassin\u2019s Creed Characters |date=27 September 2013 |access-date=28 April 2018 |last=Nichols |first=Derek |work=[[VentureBeat]]}}</ref> [[Al Mualim]] ordered [[Alta\u00efr]] to kill Robert, who died in 1191 at the [[battle of Arsuf]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.everyeye.it/articoli/speciale-assassin-s-creed-mito-storia-videogioco-prima-parte-37110.html |title=Assassin's Creed: Mito, Storia e Videogioco (Prima Parte) |last=Delrio |first=Francesco |date=31 January 2018 |access-date=28 April 2018 |work=Every Eye |language=it}}</ref> He wanted to obtain the Piece of Eden.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/assassins-creed/235887/assassins-creed-origins-and-the-story-so-far |title=Assassin's Creed Origins and the Story So Far |last=Gallagher |first=Jason M. |date=26 October 2017 |access-date=28 April 2018 |work=Den of Geek}}</ref> Maria Thorpe was his former stewardess, who was captured as prisoner by Alta\u00efr in ''[[Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.techtimes.com/articles/123237/20160111/the-complete-assassins-creed-chronology-for-now.htm |title=The Complete 'Assassin's Creed' Timeline (For Now) |date=11 January 2016 |access-date=28 April 2018 |last=Koch |first=Cameron |work=Tech Times}}</ref> and later revealed to have become Alta\u00efr's wife.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/wikis/assassins-creed-revelations/Maria_Thorpe |title=Maria Thorpe |date=29 December 2011 |access-date=10 June 2018 |work=[[IGN]] |publisher=[[Ziff Davis, LLC]]}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |title=The Norman Frontier in the Twelfth and Early Thirteenth Centuries |first=Daniel |last=Power |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |ref=harv |last=Whyte |first=Jack |author-link=Jack Whyte |title=Standard of Honor |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=SrIoCVzLR4wC&printsec=frontcover |publisher=[[Penguin Publisher]] |date=24 January 2008 |pages=800 |isbn=9781101215296 |volume=2 |series=''The Templar Trilogy'' |orig-year=18 October 2002}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Villegas-Aristizabal |first=Lucas |title=Revisi\u00f3n de las cr\u00f3nicas de Ralph de Diceto y la Gesta regis Ricardi sobre la participaci\u00f3n de la flota angevina durante la tercera cruzada en Portugal |journal=Studia historica.

Namely, they will have to have lived in Russia for the last 25 years (according to the old norm of 10 years), and the President can not become a person who has or ever had a foreign citizenship or residence permit in another country, while people who previously had citizenship of a country that or part of which became part of Russia will be able to run for president (this means that former Ukrainian citizens who lived in Crimea in 2014 and received Russian citizenship after the annexation of the peninsula will be able to run for president in the future, however, if under the old rule they could run already in these elections. Now they will not be able to do this until 2039).\n*Also, after the amendments, all former presidents will receive the status of senators for life, at the same time, they will have the right to refuse this status.<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/articles/2020/02/11/822786-bivshie-prezidenti-status-senatorov|title=\u0411\u044b\u0432\u0448\u0438\u0435

However, the Confederation Congress faced numerous problems gaining control of the land; these included: the unsanctioned movement of [[American pioneers to the Northwest Territory|American settlers]] into the Ohio Valley, violent confrontations with the region's [[Native Americans in the United States|indigenous peoples]], the ongoing presence of the British Army which continued to occupy forts in the region, and an empty U.S. treasury.<ref>{{cite web| title=Land Ordinance of 1785| url=http://ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Land_Ordinance_of_1785?rec=1472| publisher=Ohio History Central| accessdate=December 16, 2018}}</ref> The ordinance superseded the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]] (which declared that [[U.S. state|states]] would one day be formed within the region) and the [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] (which described how the Confederation Congress would sell the land to private citizens). Designed to serve as a blueprint for the development and settlement of the region, what the 1787 ordinance lacked was a strong central government to implement it. This need was addressed shortly thereafter, when the new [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] came into existence in 1789.

It also helped set the stage for later political conflicts over slavery at the federal level in the 19th century until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n==Context and history==\n{{Main|Northwest Territory}}\n\nThe territory was acquired by [[Great Britain]] from [[France]] following victory in the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[1763 Treaty of Paris]]. Great Britain took over the [[Ohio Country]], as its eastern portion was known, but a few months later closed it to new European settlement by the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]].  The Crown tried to restrict settlement of the thirteen colonies between the Appalachians and the Atlantic, which raised colonial tensions among those who wanted to move west. With the colonials' victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and signing of the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the United States claimed the territory, as well as the areas south of the Ohio.  The territories were subject to overlapping and conflicting [[State cession|claims of the states]] of [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Virginia]] dating from their colonial past. The British were active in some of the border area until after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the [[War of 1812]].\n\nThe region had long been desired for expansion by colonists.  The states were encouraged to settle their claims by the US government's ''de facto'' opening of the area to settlement following the defeat of Great Britain.  In 1784, Thomas Jefferson, a delegate from Virginia, proposed that the states should relinquish their particular claims to all the territory west of the Appalachians, and the area should be divided into new states of the Union. Jefferson's proposal to create a federal domain through state cessions of western lands was derived from earlier proposals dating back to 1776 and debates about the [[Articles of Confederation]].<ref name=hubbard>{{Cite book|last= Hubbard |first= Bill, Jr. |title= American Boundaries: the Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey |year= 2009 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-35591-7 |pages= 46\u201347, 114}}</ref> Jefferson proposed creating ten roughly rectangular states from the territory, and suggested names for the new states: ''Cherronesus'', ''Sylvania'', ''Assenisipia'', ''Illinoia'', ''Metropotamia'', ''Polypotamia'', ''Pelisipia'', ''Washington'', ''Michigania'' and ''Saratoga''.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://jeffersonswest.unl.edu/archive/view_doc.php?id=jef.00155 | title = Report from the Committee for the Western Territory to the United States Congress | work = Envisaging the West: Thomas Jefferson and the Roots of Lewis and Clark | publisher = [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln]] and [[University of Virginia]] | date = March 1, 1784 | accessdate = August 19, 2013 }}</ref> The Congress of the Confederation modified the proposal, passing it as the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]].  This ordinance established the example that would become the basis for the Northwest Ordinance three years later.\n\nThe 1784 ordinance was criticized by [[George Washington]] in 1785 and [[James Monroe]] in 1786. Monroe convinced Congress to reconsider the proposed state boundaries; a review committee recommended repealing that part of the ordinance. Other politicians questioned the 1784 ordinance's plan for organizing governments in new states, and worried that the new states' relatively small sizes would undermine the original states' power in Congress. Other events such as the reluctance of states south of the Ohio River to cede their western claims resulted in a narrowed geographic focus.<ref name=hubbard/>\n\nWhen passed in New York in 1787, the Northwest Ordinance showed the influence of Jefferson. It called for dividing the territory into gridded townships, so that once the lands were surveyed, they could be sold to individuals and speculative land companies.  This would provide both a new source of federal government revenue and an orderly pattern for future settlement.<ref>Jerel A. Rosati, James M.

These territories were to be administered directly by Congress, with the intent of their eventual admission as newly created states. The legislation was revolutionary in that it established the precedent for new lands to be administered by the central government, albeit temporarily, rather than under the jurisdiction of the individually sovereign original states, as it was with the [[Articles of Confederation]].  The legislation also broke colonial precedent by defining future use of the natural navigation, transportation and communication routes; it did so in a way that anticipated future acquisitions beyond the Northwest Territories, and established federal policy.<ref name=\"Nat&WatRes\">''The Nation and its Water Resources'', Leonard B.

It provided that at least three but not more than five states would be established in the territory, and that once such a state achieved a population of 60,000 it would be admitted into representation in the Continental Congress on an [[equal footing]] with the original thirteen states. The first state created from the Northwest Territory was [[Ohio]], in 1803, at which time the remainder was renamed Indiana Territory. The other four states were Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. A portion (about a third) of what later became the state of Minnesota was also part of the territory.\n\n===Education===\nThe ordinance of Congress called for a [[public university]] as part of the settlement and eventual statehood of the [[Northwest Territory]], further stipulating, \"Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\" In 1786, [[Manasseh Cutler]] became interested in the settlement of western lands by [[American pioneers to the Northwest Territory]]. The following year, as agent of the [[Ohio Company of Associates]] that he had been involved in creating, he organized a contract with Congress whereby his associates (former soldiers of the Revolutionary War) might purchase {{convert|1,500,000|acre|ha|abbr=on}} of land at the mouth of the [[Muskingum River]] with their Certificate of Indebtedness. Cutler also took a leading part in drafting the Ordinance of 1787 for the government of the Northwest Territory, which was finally presented to Congress by Massachusetts delegate [[Nathan Dane]]. To smooth passage of the Northwest Ordinance, Cutler bribed key congressmen by making them partners in his land company.  By changing the office of provisional governor from an elected to an appointed position, Cutler was able to offer the position to the president of Congress, Arthur St. Clair.<ref>McDougall, Walter A.

Then the Congress would control the number and proportion of the representatives from that legislature. No male could be a representative unless they were a citizen of the United States for at least three years or lived in the district for three years and who did not own at least 200 acres of land within the same district.

It also helped set the stage for later political conflicts over slavery at the federal level in the 19th century until the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].\n\n==Context and history==\n{{Main|Northwest Territory}}\n\nThe territory was acquired by [[Great Britain]] from [[France]] following victory in the [[Seven Years' War]] and the [[1763 Treaty of Paris]]. Great Britain took over the [[Ohio Country]], as its eastern portion was known, but a few months later closed it to new European settlement by the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]].  The Crown tried to restrict settlement of the thirteen colonies between the Appalachians and the Atlantic, which raised colonial tensions among those who wanted to move west. With the colonials' victory in the [[American Revolutionary War]] and signing of the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]], the United States claimed the territory, as well as the areas south of the Ohio.  The territories were subject to overlapping and conflicting [[State cession|claims of the states]] of [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Virginia]] dating from their colonial past. The British were active in some of the border area until after the [[Louisiana Purchase]] and the [[War of 1812]].\n\nThe region had long been desired for expansion by colonists.  The states were encouraged to settle their claims by the US government's ''de facto'' opening of the area to settlement following the defeat of Great Britain.  In 1784, Thomas Jefferson, a delegate from Virginia, proposed that the states should relinquish their particular claims to all the territory west of the Appalachians, and the area should be divided into new states of the Union. Jefferson's proposal to create a federal domain through state cessions of western lands was derived from earlier proposals dating back to 1776 and debates about the [[Articles of Confederation]].<ref name=hubbard>{{Cite book|last= Hubbard |first= Bill, Jr. |title= American Boundaries: the Nation, the States, the Rectangular Survey |year= 2009 |publisher= University of Chicago Press |isbn= 978-0-226-35591-7 |pages= 46\u201347, 114}}</ref> Jefferson proposed creating ten roughly rectangular states from the territory, and suggested names for the new states: ''Cherronesus'', ''Sylvania'', ''Assenisipia'', ''Illinoia'', ''Metropotamia'', ''Polypotamia'', ''Pelisipia'', ''Washington'', ''Michigania'' and ''Saratoga''.<ref>{{ cite web | url = http://jeffersonswest.unl.edu/archive/view_doc.php?id=jef.00155 | title = Report from the Committee for the Western Territory to the United States Congress | work = Envisaging the West: Thomas Jefferson and the Roots of Lewis and Clark | publisher = [[University of Nebraska\u2013Lincoln]] and [[University of Virginia]] | date = March 1, 1784 | accessdate = August 19, 2013 }}</ref> The Congress of the Confederation modified the proposal, passing it as the [[Land Ordinance of 1784]].  This ordinance established the example that would become the basis for the Northwest Ordinance three years later.\n\nThe 1784 ordinance was criticized by [[George Washington]] in 1785 and [[James Monroe]] in 1786. Monroe convinced Congress to reconsider the proposed state boundaries; a review committee recommended repealing that part of the ordinance. Other politicians questioned the 1784 ordinance's plan for organizing governments in new states, and worried that the new states' relatively small sizes would undermine the original states' power in Congress. Other events such as the reluctance of states south of the Ohio River to cede their western claims resulted in a narrowed geographic focus.<ref name=hubbard/>\n\nWhen passed in New York in 1787, the Northwest Ordinance showed the influence of Jefferson. It called for dividing the territory into gridded townships, so that once the lands were surveyed, they could be sold to individuals and speculative land companies.  This would provide both a new source of federal government revenue and an orderly pattern for future settlement.<ref>Jerel A. Rosati, James M. Scott, [https://books.google.com/books?id=SQjN0TpG7tAC&dq= ''The Politics of United States Foreign Policy''], Cengage Learning, 2010, p. 20</ref>\n\n==Effects of the legislation==\n[[File:United States 1789-08-1790-04.png|thumb|upright=1.05|Map of the states and territories of the United States as it was on August 7, 1789, when the Northwest Territory was organized]]\n\n===Established legal basis of land ownership===\nThe Northwest Ordinance of 1787 established the concept of [[fee simple]] ownership, by which ownership was in perpetuity with unlimited power to sell or give it away. This was called the \"first guarantee of freedom of contract in the United States\".<ref>\n{{cite book |title      = The Mystery of Capital: Why Capitalism Triumphs in the West and Fails Everywhere Else\n |last       = De Soto\n |first      = Hernando\n |year       = 2000\n |publisher  = Basic Books\n |location   = \n |isbn       = 978-0465016143\n |pages      = \n |url-access = registration\n |url        = https://archive.org/details/mysteryofcapital00soto\n}}\n</ref>\n\n===Abolition and transfer of state claims===\n{{Main|State cession}}\n\nPassage of the ordinance, which ceded all unsettled lands to the federal government and established the [[Public domain (land)|public domain]], followed the relinquishing of all such claims over the territory by the states. These territories were to be administered directly by Congress, with the intent of their eventual admission as newly created states. The legislation was revolutionary in that it established the precedent for new lands to be administered by the central government, albeit temporarily, rather than under the jurisdiction of the individually sovereign original states, as it was with the [[Articles of Confederation]].  The legislation also broke colonial precedent by defining future use of the natural navigation, transportation and communication routes; it did so in a way that anticipated future acquisitions beyond the Northwest Territories, and established federal policy.<ref name=\"Nat&WatRes\">''The Nation and its Water Resources'', Leonard B.

It provided that at least three but not more than five states would be established in the territory, and that once such a state achieved a population of 60,000 it would be admitted into representation in the Continental Congress on an [[equal footing]] with the original thirteen states. The first state created from the Northwest Territory was [[Ohio]], in 1803, at which time the remainder was renamed Indiana Territory. The other four states were Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. A portion (about a third) of what later became the state of Minnesota was also part of the territory.\n\n===Education===\nThe ordinance of Congress called for a [[public university]] as part of the settlement and eventual statehood of the [[Northwest Territory]], further stipulating, \"Religion, morality and knowledge being necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools and the means of education shall forever be encouraged.\" In 1786, [[Manasseh Cutler]] became interested in the settlement of western lands by [[American pioneers to the Northwest Territory]]. The following year, as agent of the [[Ohio Company of Associates]] that he had been involved in creating, he organized a contract with Congress whereby his associates (former soldiers of the Revolutionary War) might purchase {{convert|1,500,000|acre|ha|abbr=on}} of land at the mouth of the [[Muskingum River]] with their Certificate of Indebtedness. Cutler also took a leading part in drafting the Ordinance of 1787 for the government of the Northwest Territory, which was finally presented to Congress by Massachusetts delegate [[Nathan Dane]]. To smooth passage of the Northwest Ordinance, Cutler bribed key congressmen by making them partners in his land company.  By changing the office of provisional governor from an elected to an appointed position, Cutler was able to offer the position to the president of Congress, Arthur St. Clair.<ref>McDougall, Walter A.

The secretary\u2014appointed for a four-year term and given a similar freehold estate as the governor but of five hundred acres\u2014would be in charge of keeping and preserving the acts and laws passed by the territorial legislatures, keeping the public records of the district, and transmitting authentic copies of such acts and proceedings every six months to the secretary of the Continental Congress.

For every 500 free males there would be one representative, until there were 25 representatives. Then the Congress would control the number and proportion of the representatives from that legislature. No male could be a representative unless they were a citizen of the United States for at least three years or lived in the district for three years and who did not own at least 200 acres of land within the same district. These representatives would serve for a term of two years. If a representative died or was removed from office, a new one would be elected to serve out the remaining time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Northwest Ordinance |url=http://loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/northwest.html |date=July 13, 1787 |pages=337\u2013338 |website=Library of Congress |department=Primary Documents in American History |access-date=March 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Establishment of natural rights===\nThe [[natural rights]] provisions of the ordinance foreshadowed the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], the first ten amendments to the [[U.S. Constitution]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chardavoyne |first1=David G. |editor1-first=Paul |editor1-last=Finkelman\n| editor2-last  = Hershock | editor2-first = Martin J. |title=The history of Michigan law |series=Ohio University Press series on law, society, and politics in the Midwest |year=2006 |publisher=Ohio University Press |location=Athens, Ohio |isbn=978-0-8214-1661-7 |oclc=65205057 |chapter=The Northwest Ordinance and Michigan's Territorial Heritage |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=jjSD45-P2_YC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA13#v=onepage&q&f=false |quote=Its provisions established a structure of government that encouraged settlement of that vast region and provided those settlers a startling set of civil rights that presaged the U.S. Constitution's Bill of Rights }}</ref> Many of the concepts and guarantees of the Ordinance of 1787 were incorporated in the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]].
