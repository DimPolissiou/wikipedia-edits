Scripted like mini-plays, [[two-hander]] episodes have become a tradition in ''EastEnders'' over the years, dating back to a groundbreaking episode in 1986, which featured publicans [[Den Watts]] and [[Angie Watts]].<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}</ref> Devoting an entire half an hour of drama to just two characters had previously been unheard of in a bi-weekly serial before this episode aired, but it set a precedent for the programme and it has featured two-handers ever since.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nTypically the episodes feature revelations and major character changes to an important relationship, and intense interactions between two prominent characters. Structuring the episode in this way allows for in-depth focus on a specific character/storyline that would be impossible to achieve in the fast-moving and rapidly cut regular episodes. It also relies on just the one story and two actors to hold the audience for the entire duration of the episode.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nPractically, these episodes were originally created for speedy filming purposes, as while the two actors were filming the two-hander, the remaining cast could be filming another episode. \n\n== Two-hander episodes ==\n===Den and Angie Watts (16 October 1986)===\nThe first two-hander features [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) and [[Angie Watts]] ([[Anita Dobson]]) and is structured like a [[tennis]] match, with a non-speaking window cleaner forever strolling innocently into the action. The episode is written by Jane Hollowood and directed by [[Antonia Bird]].<ref name=\"first10years\"/> This episode was watched by 14.0 million viewers in its original broadcast.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19861016.shtml Angie - six months to live]\", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 31 October 2006.</ref> Writers chose to give Den and Angie a two-hander episode due to their popularity.<ref>''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07chwf7 From EastEnders to Hollywood: Antonia Bird]'', [[BBC Four]], 26 May 2016.</ref>\n\nDen and Angie's marriage has broken down, and before the episode, Den finally decides to end the marriage and leave Angie for his mistress, [[Jan Hammond]] ([[Jane How]]). The episode begins with Den trying to talk to Angie to tell her that he wants to leave her and get a divorce. Angie stalls but Den persists and explains to her that he wants a clean break from her, their pub, [[The Queen Victoria]], [[Albert Square]] and [[Walford]]. Den tells Angie that he shall get another pub through a deal with [[James Wilmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]) and Jan would be doing the books. Angie is shocked and feels defeated, but she then reveals that she is [[terminally ill]] with only six months to live. Den does not believe her, but Angie explains her story to Den; Angie's hysterical performance eventually convinces him. Den crumbles and promises to stay with her, adding that he will kill Angie if she is lying. Consumed by guilt, Den asks Angie for her forgiveness. As Den leaves Angie alone and takes their dog [[Roly]] for a walk, she gives a deranged smile, revealing that she has been lying to Den.\n\n===Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (2 July 1987)===\n\nThe second two-hander features old friends [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]) and [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]), who are babysitting [[Vicki Fowler]] (Emma Herry) one rainy afternoon. This episode centres around nostalgia and growing old and was scripted to show the sadness behind the often comical characters of Dot and Ethel. The episode was written by Charlie Humphreys and directed by [[Mike Gibbon]], a future producer of the show.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nWhile baby Vicki sleeps, Dot and Ethel reminisce about their lives during World War II and share secrets from their girlhoods. During the war Ethel was 17 and remained in London where she witnessed the death of her family,  who were killed by a German [[V-1 flying bomb|doodlebug]]. Dot was [[Emergency evacuation|evacuated]] to Wales when she was three years old and stayed with a couple she called [[List of EastEnders spin-off characters#Gwen|Auntie Gwen]] and [[List of EastEnders spin-off characters#Will|Uncle Will]], who wanted to adopt her. Dot later confessed that she had an abortion soon after she married [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]) because he told her he would leave her if she kept the baby. This caused a furious [[Harold Legg|Dr. Harold Legg]] ([[Leonard Fenton]]) to punch Charlie on the nose in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]]. Towards the end of the episode Dot goes out to the shop for a loaf bread and some fig rolls. When she returns Ethel is asleep and Dot thinks she has died and begins weeping and reciting the [[Lord's Prayer]]. When Ethel rouses, Dot panics and Ethel has to slap her out of it. Ethel then tearfully reminisces about her dead husband [[William Skinner (EastEnders)|William]] and the past. As the episode ends, Dot and Ethel tend to Vicki while singing.\n\n===Sharon Watts and Michelle Fowler (4 April 1989)===\nThe third two-hander featured the best friends [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) and [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]). In the aftermath of Sharon's adoptive father, [[Den Watts]]' ([[Leslie Grantham]]) death, the two friends started an evening at home with a bottle of wine and their memories. This episode was written by [[Tony McHale]] and directed by [[Mike Gibbon]].<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nAfter Den's supposed murder, Sharon - his adoptive daughter - began to speculate about the identity of the mysterious woman who had been seen with him prior to his death. When Sharon told Michelle that she felt that she and her daughter [[Vicki Fowler]] ([[Samantha Leigh Martin]]) were now her family, Michelle blurted out a secret that she'd been keeping for over three years - that Den was Vicki's father and she was the mystery woman who was seen with Den before his death. Michelle thought Sharon would be comforted to know that she was, in a sense, Vicki's sister, and that a part of Den lived on in Vicki. However, Sharon took the news very badly, feeling hurt, angry and deceived. After slapping Michelle and having an emotional showdown, Sharon left their flat wishing that Michelle had never told her.\n\n===Grant and Phil Mitchell (15 November 1994)===\n{{see also|Sharongate}}\nThis episode featured the Mitchell brothers, [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]). Following Grant's discovery that Phil had slept with his wife, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), Grant had beaten Phil so badly that he was hospitalised with a dangerous blood clot to the brain. Phil was rushed into surgery, and the clot was removed. As Grant sat with his brother, the two made a pact and promised that they would never let a woman come between them again.\n\nAs Phil awoke from his surgery he found his brother sleeping next to him, holding his hand. Grant awoke and instantly got defensive claiming that he was only there because their friend [[Nigel Bates]] ([[Paul Bradley (British actor)|Paul Bradley]]) had persuaded him. As the two started talking Grant started to reminisce about the past when a girl he was dating came onto Phil and he told him. He asked him if that's what it was like with Sharon. Did she come onto him? And why didn't he tell him? Phil told him it wasn't like that, but Grant kept on calling Sharon a slut and blaming her for the whole affair. He was angry with himself for marrying a slapper. Phil tried to tell him that Sharon was not a slut, but his protests fell on deaf ears. Grant proceeded to ask Phil how easy Sharon was to pull. He wouldn't answer, but Grant persisted saying that he never used to be so bashful. After continual pestering Phil began to get agitated and told Grant that Sharon was easy and he didn't even have to get out of first gear.\n\nThey then began to talk about their relationship, how people used to hate them because they were so close and could do anything together and this was always Sharon's problem. After they reminisced about their many conquests with women Grant returned to the topic of Sharon. He was planning to crush her \"like a table tennis ball\" and make her pay for what she'd done. Phil warned him not to do anything stupid, which angered Grant and he accused him of sticking up for Sharon, but Phil assured him he was merely concerned for his welfare. He persuaded Grant that if the two of them didn't stick together, Grant would end up back in [[prison]]. He promised Grant that he'd do anything for him and as Grant began to weep Phil promised that from now on, it will be just the two of them.\n\n===Pat Butcher and Peggy Mitchell (27 October 1998)===\nThis episode featured [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) and [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]). Peggy was on the warpath after being told about a fabricated affair between her fianc\u00e9 [[Frank Butcher|Frank]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) and his ex-wife Pat. However, Pat had other concerns. Her husband, [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]), had driven off like a suicidal maniac nearly hitting her in the process. As Frank sped off after Roy, Pat and Peggy waited it out in the Evans household and made their feelings to each other clear.\n\nPat was in shock about Roy nearly hitting her, but convinced herself that he merely didn't see her. Peggy was not so sure and commented that running her down was cheaper than divorce, and suggested that Roy had also found out about her affair. Pat insisted that nothing happened between her and Frank, but Peggy took a lot of convincing, and they both traded insults at each other. Pat told Peggy that Frank talked about her a lot, but Peggy couldn't accept this and when Pat left the room for a bath, Peggy began to sob. Pat eventually joined her and Peggy accused her of still loving Frank. Pat didn't quite deny it, but said she has moved on and knows when to give up on something. Peggy was convinced that Frank had feelings for Pat too.\n\nAfter opening a bottle of wine Pat began to feel sorry for herself, saying that she was cursed and turned rich, happy men into disasters - Roy was broke and [[impotent]], whereas Frank who has spent a couple of years away from her, was back to his old virile self. Peggy was amazed to discover that Roy was impotent and Pat was quick to point out that sex wasn't important and she was happy to have finally found a man who wanted her to settle down.\n\nAfter the police arrived to inform Pat that their search for Roy had been fruitless, Peggy pestered them for some information, which made her suspect that Roy had come to harm. Now feeling more sympathetic Peggy went to converse with Pat, but the atmosphere soon became frosty once again when each began to recount their wonderful times with Frank. Pat stuck the knife in further by saying that she could have slept with Frank if she'd wanted to the night before, he still fancied her and the least encouragement would have sufficed. The bitching continued with Pat branding Peggy \"mutton dressed as lamb\" and Peggy blaming Pat's appearance for Roy's impotence. Their rowing finally descended into violence as both ladies threw wine glasses at each other and then a fight started when Peggy grabbed the edge of the kitchen table and threw it over to clear the way to attack Pat. The episode ended with Pat slapping Peggy, saying \"YOU BITCH!\" and Peggy slapping Pat right back, exclaiming \"YOU COW!\", right before the doorbell rang.\n\n===Roy Evans and Frank Butcher (29 October 1998)===\n\nOccurring simultaneously to the [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) and [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]) two-hander described above, this episode featured [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]) and [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]). After Roy sped off nearly hitting Pat with his car, Frank followed him and forced him to rethink a drastic decision.\n\nFrank followed Roy's car as he sped off extremely erratically. Eventually, Roy turned into a [[multi-storey car park]], drove to the top and crashed the car into some rubble. He then made his way to the roof, and stood on the edge contemplating [[suicide]]. Frank followed and tried to persuade him to get down, saying he should think about his family, who will blame themselves and about Pat who thinks that he tried to kill her earlier. Roy claimed that he didn't see her, but added that it was all hopeless and he had lost everything, so there was no point living. Frank pointed out that he had a family who loved him and money was not important. Frank eventually persuaded him to come down to talk, promising that if he felt the same afterwards, he would bring him back and not stop him from taking his own life. Roy agreed and the two of them went to a strip club and ordered a couple of brandies. Roy continued to explain the reason for his depression. He had been conned in a car deal and was facing bankruptcy. Frank told Roy that they had more in common than he might think, as he once tried to commit suicide too, was left bankrupt and he made the mistake of not going back to Pat then, but for Roy it wasn't too late.\n\nRoy felt that Pat was still in love with Frank, and then accidentally let slip about his impotency, which only humiliated him further. Frank was understanding and promised he wouldn't tell anyone, and he in turn shared a story with Roy, relaying that he had fathered a child with some young girl he met when he had his breakdown, and no one else knew. Roy was comforted to know that Frank had skeletons in his closet too, and eventually agreed to go home. Frank drove them back, they rang the bell at the Evanses just as Peggy and Pat's fight was in full flow. Pat was thrilled to see Roy, and Peggy a little less thrilled to see Frank, so he asked her if they were still engaged. She responded \"Just\".\n\n===Matthew Rose and Steve Owen (3 February 2000)=== <!-- Linked from Tom Hooper (director) -->\nThis episode featured [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]) and [[Matthew Rose (EastEnders)|Matthew Rose]] ([[Joe Absolom]]). Steve had let Matthew serve time in prison for [[Saskia Duncan]]'s (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor) murder. Upon his release Matthew came to Walford looking for revenge. 19.8 million viewers watched this episode.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic20000203.shtml \"Matthew's revenge\"]\", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 31 October 2006.</ref>\n\nWhen Matthew turned up at e20 nightclub Steve was shocked by the visible transformation and could see that Matthew was seeking revenge. Matthew produced a video - he had rigged Steve's flat with booby traps and Steve knew it was only a matter of time before his sister [[Jackie Owen]] ([[Race Davies]]) arrived home to trigger them. Matthew demanded \u00a310,000. Steve tried to gain the upper hand by pulling his gun from the safe, but Matthew was one step ahead and had already removed the [[bullet]]s. As they struggled Matthew grabbed a bottle and knocked Steve unconscious. He then tied and bound him to the chair.\n\nWhen Steve came to he tried to use a piece of smashed bottle to free himself, and managed to grab hold of the gun Matthew was waving in his face. He demanded that Matthew remove the booby traps from his flat. However Matthew stopped Steve in his tracks by revealing that he had killed Saskia's sister, [[Claudia Fielding|Claudia]] (Romla Walker), and framed him for the deed, just as he had done to him. Steve buckled and fell to the floor, unable to take in what was happening. He began to beg and cry, whilst Matthew splattered [[petrol]] around the room and then pulled a [[Zippo|zippo lighter]] from his pocket. As he lit the lighter and dropped it to the floor Steve was gripped with fear. However he soon realised that there was no fire or smoke. Matthew had used water instead of petrol and had invented the whole scenario to belittle him and watch him beg for mercy.\n\n===Ricky Butcher and Phil Mitchell (20 April 2000)===\nThis episode featured [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and his long-time employer [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). After losing his wife [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]); son [[Liam Butcher|Liam]] (Jack & Tom Godolphin); and finally his mind, Ricky said an emotional farewell to Albert Square - while Phil tried to talk him out of leaving.\n\nRicky had sped out of Walford in his car and been involved in an accident. Phil went after him and passed the police retrieving the wreck of Ricky's car. They told him to go to the police station. Phil arrived and Ricky appeared - he had been caught over the limit doing {{convert|90|mph}} when he crashed.\n\nRicky was furious with Phil for allowing him to work on dodgy motors at The Arches, and was even more annoyed when he discovered that the car he had totalled was stolen. Ricky threatened to go back to the station to tell the police everything. Phil forced him to get into the car, but whilst he was being driven away he told Phil that he was not going home, and started fighting with Phil in order to get him to stop. The car swerved dangerously and Phil was forced to stop at the next service station.\n\nPhil tried to explain the situation with the car-scam, saying that he only got involved to bail [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]) out and it was just a favour. Ricky was furious that he could have been jailed for helping Phil. Ricky felt that there was nothing to go back to Walford for. He had lost his wife and son and was devastated that Bianca was seeing another man. Ricky was also hurt because he had trusted Phil - he was the only thing that held him together over the last few weeks, but now he could no longer trust him. As he went to leave Phil chased him and tried to stop him leaving. However Ricky refused to let Phil push him around and informed Phil that he had purposefully driven his car into the back of the truck. Phil tried to reason that he had also lost his family. He had managed to turn his life around and Ricky could do the same. Phil tried to make Ricky think of the ramifications of his departure - Pat would dump Roy, Frank would go mad and run away again, and Phil would be dumped in it with the police. Ricky didn't care and as he began to walk off Phil shouted after him that everyone needs him to stay, and he was Ricky's friend and was there for him when he found out his unborn baby, who was named Natasha, had [[spina bifida]]. The memory stirred up buried emotions in Ricky, and as he burst into tears Phil embraced him.\n\nAs dawn began to break Phil tried to coerce Ricky home by offering him partnership in The Arches. He also promised to take the rap for the dodgy motor that Ricky was driving and to sort out his nemesis [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]) for him. Phil apologized for all the things he'd done to Ricky in the past, but wanted the chance to make it up to him and turn things around. Ricky begrudgingly accepted, but when Phil left briefly to make a quick phone call, Ricky decided that he couldn't return to Walford. While Phil's back was turned, he asked a lorry driver for a lift and departed.\n\n===Kat and Zoe Slater (2 October 2001)===\nThis episode features [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and her daughter [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]), who up until this moment has lived her life thinking that Kat is her sister. In the previous episode, Zoe announces that she is leaving Walford to live with her uncle, [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry Slater]] ([[Michael Elphick]]), in [[Spain]], but Kat is adamant that she will not. A screaming row in the street ensues and Zoe shouts \"You can't tell me what to do, you ain't my mother!\", to which Kat's desperate reply is, \"Yes I am!\". 16.9 million viewers tuned in for this episode.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic20011001.shtml \"You're not my mother...\"]\", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 31 October 2006.</ref>\n\nThis episode began with Zoe still reeling from Kat's outburst. Back at the Slaters', Zoe demanded to know what Kat meant. Kat tried to take back what she had said, but after continuous pestering, she finally relented and admitted that what she said was the truth. This devastated Zoe, and while she locked herself in her room distraught, Kat sat outside and began to explain the reason for the deception. She had fallen pregnant when she was 13, and her parents, disappointed and ashamed, forced her to hand Zoe over to them at birth. They proceeded to bring her up as their own child. Kat relayed her heartache at having to watch her own child being brought up by her parents, and the anxiety she felt at having to pretend that she was her sister for her whole life. The lies and deception were too much for Zoe, and when she discovered that Kat had wanted to abort her, the two lashed out at each other in fury.\n\nThe news made Zoe all the more determined to live with her uncle Harry in Spain, and upon hearing this Kat dropped her second bombshell - she couldn't go and live with Harry because he was her father. Kat's uncle had sexually abused her as a child, leaving her pregnant with Zoe. This meant that Zoe's father was simultaneously her great uncle.\n\n===Sonia Jackson and Dot Branning (9 May 2002)===\nThis episode featured [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia Jackson]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) and her step-grandmother [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]). Sonia had kidnapped the daughter she had given up for adoption and was keeping her hidden away at the Brannings'. Dot tried to reason with Sonia and shared a secret of her own.\n\nWith [[Rebecca Miller (EastEnders)|Rebecca Miller]] asleep upstairs, Sonia ransacked the house for money in order to make her getaway. Dot frantically knocked at the door, shouting that Rebecca's adoptive parents, [[Neil Miller (EastEnders)|Neil Miller]] (Robin Sneller) and [[Sue Miller (EastEnders)|Sue Miller]] ([[Victoria Willing]]), were going to call the police unless Sonia let her in. Sonia tried to deny Rebecca was there, but Dot knew otherwise and made it clear that she was there to retrieve the baby for the Millers. Sonia became distressed by this, arguing that as she was Rebecca's mother she can look after her. The Millers had given Dot a deadline, she had 15 minutes to persuade Sonia to surrender Rebecca or they would involve the police.\n\nSonia tried to explain herself. The Millers had planned to take Rebecca away without granting her a last visit. She was also upset at how much her baby had changed since she was born and she had decided that she wanted her back. Dot argued that she couldn't change her mind now that Rebecca had been adopted and she no longer had any rights as her mother. When Dot instructed Sonia to take Rebecca outside, she threatened to abscond with the baby. She begged Dot to stall the police so she could escape via the back door and was furious when Dot refused. Dot proceeded to point out that Sonia had missed out on 18 months of Rebecca's life and that she hardly knew her daughter now. Despite her pleas, Dot refused to help Sonia - and threatened to call the police herself if the kidnapping continued.\n\nSonia became inconsolable. Dot tried to reassure her that everything would be alright, she just needed some inner strength. Sonia became angry with Dot for living her life by the Bible and Dot was mortified when she threw the holy book across the room. Sonia wondered why Dot was so willing to help her criminal son [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]), but wouldn't help her. Dot explained that she helped Nick because she had something to make up for. She had an abortion when she was 21 years old. Her husband [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]) had forced her to terminate the pregnancy against her wishes. Dot described how guilty she felt after the abortion. She thought she had put it all behind her until the christening gown was found buried in the garden of [[Mark Fowler]]'s ([[Todd Carty]]) house. She wished she had kept the baby, now she's left feeling cold and empty. Sonia wondered whether she should have been a single mum like her own mother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]). She relayed that Carol was furious about the adoption, but Dot reassured her that Rebecca would have a good life with the Millers.\n\nJust as the Millers decided to call the police, Rebecca began to cry. When Sonia was unable to console her she finally realised that it was time to give her up. Tearfully, she passed Rebecca over to her relieved parents.\n\n===Phil Mitchell and Sharon Watts (5 September 2002)===\nThis episode featured the ex-lovers [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]). Sharon and Phil had a heart to heart about their troubled pasts. They laid ghosts to rest and agreed to move on with their lives.\n\nSharon and Phil were simultaneously having problems in their relationships. Sharon had fallen out with [[Tom Banks (EastEnders)|Tom Banks]] ([[Colm \u00d3 Maonla\u00ed]]), due to malicious stirring from his ex-wife Sadie  (Isobel Middleton), and Phil had given [[Lisa Fowler]] ([[Lucy Benjamin]]) an ultimatum - she was to leave her husband [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]) before the day was over. As Phil waited for Lisa to arrive in the middle of the night, he heard a knock at the door of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]]. He opened the door expecting to find Lisa, but found Sharon instead.\n\nSharon declared that she and Tom were over. Phil accused her of being stroppy and spoilt and she retaliated by accusing him of using Lisa so he could get his hands on their daughter, [[Louise Mitchell]] (Rachel Cox). The ex-lovers began drinking and flirting and talked about their past relationship. As they talked Phil relaxed and opened up about his father. Phil relayed how he idolised his father but that all changed when he saw how badly he treated his mother. He admitted that his deepest wish was to be a good father and expressed his sorrow that his two children were living with other men. Phil began to shake with emotion as he recalled the beatings he received from his father, whilst his brother [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) could do no wrong. After one horrific Christmas, Phil vowed to run away and he still carried the note he was going to leave his parents. He never did run away, but the violence continued until he was big enough to fight back. Sharon had also had issues with her parents. She loved them both, but was caught in the middle of their volatile marriage. After they rowed, they used to compete with each other for her affections.\n\nSharon then realised that they both had to stop living in the past. She decided to sell her share in The Queen Vic as it reminded her of her parents and Grant. Phil agreed to buy her out. Sharon then urged Phil to put his troubled relationship with his father behind him. Their heart to heart helped her to realise that she wanted to make a go of things with Tom. As Sharon left, Phil took the note that he wrote when he was a boy out of his pocket. He set it on fire to signify that it was time for him to move on too.\n\n===Little Mo and Trevor Morgan (31 October 2002)===\nThis episode featured [[Little Mo Mitchell|Little Mo Morgan]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) and her abusive husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]). It was the night of Little Mo and [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]]'s ([[Perry Fenwick]]) engagement party. Trevor snatched Little Mo from the party at ''Angie's Den'' and imprisoned her in the Slater house. To make matters worse, Trevor's baby son Sean was his other hostage.\n\nTrevor had imprisoned Little Mo in the Slater house. He called her stupid for believing he'd ever grant her a divorce. Ominously, he reminded her of their marriage vows - including \"till death us do part\". Trevor began to weep as he admitted he was totally obsessed with Little Mo. He was furious that she had been unfaithful to him with Billy and reminded her that she will always be his. Little Mo was disgusted and wondered how Trevor had ended up in such a pitiful state. The early years of their marriage had been happy - so why did Trevor start beating her? He explained that he couldn't stand sharing her and resented the time she spent caring for her sick mother, [[Viv Slater|Viv]] (Debi Gibson). He never liked Viv, and was glad when she died. Trevor raged that it wasn't enough for him to be part of her family, he wanted to be all of it.\n\nTrevor then turned violent, pushed Little Mo against the wall and reminded her that he'd kill her if she ever slept with another man. Terrified, Little Mo tried to escape but found that all the doors were locked. She ran upstairs in a panic, but Trevor followed and threw her to the ground saying that she will never hurt him again. Half-crazed with anger, Trevor barked questions at Little Mo, forcing her to admit that it was morally wrong for her, as his wife, to sleep with another man. He claimed that Billy couldn't possibly love her like he did. His questions took on an intimate nature and as he made a move towards Little Mo she recoiled in fear, but Trevor then declared there was no time for that, he had other plans for her. After calmly leaving the room, Little Mo followed to find Trevor pouring petrol on the stairs and suddenly she heard baby Sean crying upstairs. Out of desperation, Little Mo claimed that she still loved Trevor and she had never wanted a divorce. Thinking fast, she blamed Billy for turning her against him. She tore off her engagement ring and threw it away. Trevor slumped to the ground, eager to believe that she still loved him. Little Mo beckoned to him and they embraced. As she cradled him in her arms he sobbed that he never meant to hurt her.\n\nLittle Mo suggested they go away together, but that she first needed to return Sean to his mother. When Trevor tried to get romantic, Little Mo shrieked and shook him off. Realising that he was being fooled, Trevor turned violent and Little Mo froze with fear, but seeing Billy's ring on the carpet gave her courage. She stared at Trevor and proclaimed that she wasn't frightened of him anymore. She told him that she could see him for what he was - a coward and a bully. Shocked at her defiance, Trevor whispered that she should be scared, but Little Mo was defiant and told him that he didn't have the guts to go through with his threat. She lit a match forcing an alarmed Trevor to grab it from her. In his haste the match fell to the floor and flames began to fill the room, Trevor was killed though Little Mo and the baby survived.\n\n===Lisa Fowler and Phil Mitchell (27 March 2003)===\nThis episode featured [[Lisa Fowler]] ([[Lucy Benjamin]]) and her ex-boyfriend [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) in flashbacks to October 2002 while Phil recounts the events to [[Kate Mitchell|Kate Morton]] ([[Jill Halfpenny]]). After Lisa abducted Phil's daughter and fled to [[Portugal]], Phil tracked her down and was adamant that he was returning to Walford with his daughter. Phil had been suspected of killing Lisa and had her blood on his jacket and had burned her passport when he returned the UK. Kate was eager to get the truth and asked outright if Phil had killed Lisa.\n\nAfter fleeing from Phil, Lisa was trapped at the edge of a cliff grasping their daughter, [[Louise Mitchell]] (Rachel Cox). Phil implored her to move away from the cliff edge, but Lisa was terrified and yelled at Phil to get away from her. Phil stepped back and urged Lisa to consider Louise's safety and slowly, Lisa moved away from the edge.\n\nLisa saw a man walking his dog and shouted in vain for help. Her yelling made Louise cry and Lisa tried to calm her with a lullaby. Phil was biding his time and refused to leave without Louise. Lisa finally began to calm down so Phil led to her to an abandoned cottage so they could talk. As they settled inside Phil remarked how beautiful his daughter was, and paid the same compliment to Lisa. He told Lisa that he missed them both so much. Lisa was suspicious, but after continual pressure she allowed Phil to hold Louise.\n\nPhil tried to persuade Lisa that children need their fathers', and whilst Lisa admitted that she missed her own father she insisted that neither of them were going back with Phil. Phil tried to keep her talking, he questioned her about her father. Lisa confessed that she had a recurring dream involving her dad. As she recalled the dream, she becomes highly distraught and informed him that it involved coffins and babies. Phil found this disturbing and did his best to convince Lisa that she wasn't well. He offered to arrange the professional help that she obviously needed, but Lisa accused Phil of trying to trap her into returning to England. Phil immediately got defensive, he continued his mind games and managed to make Lisa consider that a life in Portugal, with an unskilled, jobless mother was not appropriate for their daughter. Phil fired question after question at Lisa, and the continual probing began to baffle Lisa. As he saw it, she had no money and no plans. It was not enough to merely love her daughter if she couldn't provide for her. He told her that babies need stability and their first year was hugely important. Lisa had moved from man to man, and from one place to another in that time. Distressed, Lisa put her hands over her ears, whilst Phil continued to rant that she was not fit to look after a dog, let alone a baby. He declared that Lisa was mentally unstable and Louise was not safe with her. Phil urged Lisa to do what was best for Louise.\n\nExhausted by Phil's personal attacks, Lisa fell quiet. Phil then stated calmly that if she tried to stop him taking Louise, he'd have her committed. Lisa protested that the only mad thing she had ever done was get involved with him, but Phil proceeded to plants doubts in her mind. He reminded her that she shot him and left him for dead and asked if that was how a sane person behaved. Lisa was visibly distressed and shaking. Sensing that the moment was right, Phil ordered her to fetch Louise and hand her over to him. Bewildered, Lisa obeyed him. He then announced that it was best if Lisa didn't ever try to return to Walford. He was prepared to reveal all about the shooting if she did.\n\nLisa staggered outside in confusion and grief. Phil ignored her howls of anguish and walked away with Louise whilst Lisa stared over the edge of the cliff.\n\n===Den and Sharon Watts (30 September 2003)===\nThis episode reunited [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) with his adoptive daughter [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), after she'd spent 14 years thinking that he was dead. Sharon had the shock of her life when her father emerged from the shadows and muttered \"Hello, Princess!\". Sharon couldn't believe that her father was still alive. Den did his best to explain where he'd been, but Sharon was torn between delight and anger.\n\nSharon touched Den, dumbstruck to see her dad after all these years, but before she had a chance to take it in she began to feel nauseous and ran to the toilet to be violently sick. Upon her return, Den proceeded to try to explain himself. Sharon stared in disbelief and wanted to know how he could let her think that he was dead all this time. As emotions began to run high, Sharon revealed that she'd never stopped grieving for him. Den explained that he couldn't take the risk in contacting her, or they would have both been in danger. Den only felt safe to return to Walford after hearing that [[Jack Dalton (EastEnders)|Jack Dalton]] ([[Hywel Bennett]]) - a gangster associated with his attempted murder - had died. He apologised to Sharon for never having the guts to get in touch. Sharon sobbed as she recalled the last conversation she ever had with him. She washed her hands of him, and the next thing she knew he was dead. She'd regretted her harsh words ever since, she thought he'd died thinking that she hated him. Sharon confessed that she'd made a mess of her life. Things would have been easier if he'd been around. Just his voice on the end of the phone would have helped. Den had tears in his eyes as he hugged Sharon.\n\nAs the two began to bond, Den brought the conversation round to his first wife and Sharon's adoptive mother, [[Angie Watts]] ([[Anita Dobson]]) and offended Sharon by referring to her as a \"barmy old lush\". Sharon announced that Angie had died. Den didn't even know. Furious, Sharon then decided it was too late for Den to make amends, and yelled at him to leave her alone. Den did as she wanted and wandered though the Square, before breaking into The Queen Vic, the pub he used to own. Den surveyed the pub and Sharon followed him inside. They drank a toast to Angie and Sharon revealed how she nursed her mum during the painful final days of her fatal illness. Den reflected that he had some good times in the pub, but Sharon could not remember many good times \u2013 she just recalled her parents' furious rows. She mentioned how she once ran it with [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), whom Den had never even heard of. Sharon then remembered that she had an axe to grind with her father, for getting her best friend [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]) pregnant when she was only 16. Den tried to explain what happened between him and Michelle, but Sharon was furious with him for cheating on her mother and blamed him for sending her to an early grave.\n\nSharon decided that she was not going to allow Den to ruin her life again. Den tried to calm her, but she insisted that she, [[Vicki Fowler]] ([[Scarlett Johnson]]) and [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) didn't need him. Den assumed that Dennis was Sharon's boyfriend and told her he wasn't important. Then Sharon revealed that he wasn't her boyfriend, Dennis was his son.\n\n===Den Watts and Dennis Rickman (1 April 2004)===\nThis episode featured [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) and [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]). Father and son went head to head in The Queen Vic. Both were desperate to win the battle. It ended with violence, and one being the definite loser.\n\nDen had just discovered that his adoptive daughter, [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), was sleeping with his son, Dennis. He was not happy. In The Queen Vic, Den took Dennis aside for a chat. Dennis sat down with trepidation but was amazed that Den was so calm. He explained that he and Sharon were in love, but Den had doubts. With Dennis showing no signs of budging, Den reluctantly decided to that Dennis had to be forced away from Sharon rather than persuaded. When Dennis referred to their bonding chat last Christmas and that he was glad that Den now knew about him and Sharon, Den mocked him cruelly, claiming that their prior bonding was all an act. He was only pretending when he acted fatherly towards him and didn't care about him in the slightest. Dennis was hurt and taken aback and as Den belittled him further, remembering the way Dennis melted when he called him \"son\", Dennis became enraged. Den continued his diatribe on Dennis, threatening to inform Sharon that he had killed [[Jack Dalton (EastEnders)|Jack Dalton]] ([[Hywel Bennett]]), but it wasn't enough to scare Dennis off.\n\nDen continued to goad him, asking how long it would be before he turned his attentions to his biological sister, [[Vicki Fowler]] ([[Scarlett Johnson]]), and Dennis was sickened by the remark. Den argued that Dennis couldn't tell the difference between female relatives and lovers. He taunted Dennis about his background, telling him that years of misery and abuse had turned him into the man that he was. Dennis managed to remain calm and was sure that Den was closer to losing his temper than he was. Dennis said he realised that they would always be at loggerheads with each other. He had let Den triumph before, because he thought he wanted a father, but even though Den had put up a good fight, he wasn't going to let him win this time. Den became enraged and asserted that his and Sharon's affair was over. He ordered Dennis to leave, but Dennis replied repeatedly that he loved Sharon. Calmly, he prepared to head home to her. Seeing that he was losing the fight Den turned angry and hurled Dennis through the doors of The Queen Vic. Father and son stood head to head, while Dennis bragged about Sharon leaving with him. Cockily, he shoved his father aside. Furious, Den spat out that some twisted pervert must have got to Dennis in the past, and caused him to think that a relationship with his own sister was acceptable. He described the abuse Dennis must have suffered in care and waved goodbye to the son he never wanted. Dennis finally snapped and lunged at him out of control, but was restrained. Eventually he broke free and lashed out, accidentally punching Sharon, who had just arrived, in the process. A victorious Den then took Sharon home.\n\n===Kat Slater and Alfie Moon (25 May 2004)===\nThis episode featured [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]). Alfie had been given a video of [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]) sleeping with his wife, Kat. Alfie owed Andy money and when he couldn't pay he Andy threatened his safety. Kat slept with Andy as a trade for her husband's life, but Alfie could not accept her excuses.\n\nThe episode began with a jovial Kat returning home, but her mood soon changed after she saw that Andy had filmed their sordid liaison and maliciously given it to Alfie to watch. Alfie was in pieces and couldn't bear to look at his wife. As Kat pleaded with Alfie to listen to her explanation, he refused, so Kat screamed that she did it all for him. Alfie was disgusted and called her a cheap little slapper. Hurt, Kat slapped Alfie and he slapped her right back, leaving Kat stunned that he could do such a thing.\n\nAs it all sunk in Alfie broke down in tears, whilst Kat desperately tried to protest that Andy tricked her. Alfie could only laugh at her feeble excuse. She told him that she did it to protect him and because she loved him, but Alfie felt hurt and betrayed. He suggested that she go back to Andy, as he didn't want her anywhere near him. Through his tears and anguish Alfie  revealed the guilt he'd always carried about his parents' death in a car crash and how he blamed himself for not fixing something his dad asked him to. Now he can't live with the thought that his negligence ruined things again. He told Kat that their marriage was over and Kat had no choice but to pack her bags. As she was about to go Alfie questioned her more about her motives and Kat tried to make him realise that Andy's behaviour was all about revenge and that they can get past this and stay together. As Alfie continued to reject her, Kat turned on him and brought up her past sexual abuse at the hands of her uncle [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry Slater]] ([[Michael Elphick]]) and likened it to her affair with Andy. Sobbing, she made one last attempt to change his mind and asked him to give her a cuddle. However, Alfie's pride wouldn't let him take her back and he showed her the door.\n\nAs Kat left The Queen Vic in tears she heard the door open and saw Alfie there. She held out her hand and he took it. They agreed that it would be tough, but decided to try to find a way to work things out.\n\n===Den Watts and Dot Branning (26 August 2004)===\nThis episode featured long-time neighbours, [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) and [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]). Den's wife had left him following his affair, and his relationship with his son was in tatters after he propositioned his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Dot was arguing with her husband, [[Jim Branning]] ([[John Bardon]]) and was very reluctant to tell him about her secret cancer illness. Den and Dot forced each other to examine their relationships with others.\n\nLate one evening Den spotted some youths vandalising the launderette. After seeing off the thugs, Dot emerged from the back room and Den could see that she had been crying.\n\nDot began to engage Den in conversation about his wife [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy-Ann Oberman]]) and how he felt now that she had left him. Den's response was blas\u00e9, which angered Dot and she accused him of putting up a front. Dot chastised Den for his demeanour and pointed out that he couldn't face up to his own guilt. She told him that he treated his friends and family appallingly and when he had heard enough and turned to leave, he found that Dot had locked him in and refused to give him the keys. As Den was forced to continue the conversation Dot pestered him more about Chrissie and threatened to haunt him if he didn't plead Chrissie for forgiveness.\n\nEventually, Dot informed Den that she was dying and he was shocked to hear that she had [[kidney cancer]]. However Dot became cagey when Den quizzed her about her illness. He wanted her to have the best care possible and even offered to pay for it, but Dot rejected his help - she had chosen not to have her cancer treated. She wanted to face death with dignity and begged Den to keep her secret quiet as even her husband, Jim, didn't know she was suffering.\nDen wasn't convinced by Dot's motives for keeping her illness from Jim, but she believed that she was acting in his best interests. Den insisted that Dot's deceit would destroy her marriage and told her to open up to Jim. Den then slyly told her that if she didn't come clean with Jim, she couldn't take the moral high ground next time he messed up. They both decided that they needed to sort their marriages out.\n\nWhen Jim arrived to collect Dot, Den explained that she was sorting him out and squeezed Dot's hand tenderly before leaving. At home Den apologised to his son and heeding Dot's advice, he bit the bullet and called Chrissie. Meanwhile, Dot took Den's advice and decided that it was time to come clean to Jim.\n\n===Sonia Fowler and Martin Fowler (5 January 2007)===\nFollowing the death of [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] confronts [[Sonia Fowler]] about her admission that she killed Pauline. As Martin attacks [[Joe Macer]], believing he killed his mother, Sonia confesses it was she who had the altercation with Pauline.

As Sonia tries to explain the circumstances surrounding her hitting Pauline, Martin refuses to believe her or accept her apologies. Believing Sonia to be guilty of murder, Martin calls the police and takes their daughter [[Rebecca Fowler]] home, telling Sonia she won't be seeing her daughter again. The police arrive and Sonia is arrested as the residents of Walford look on.\n\n===Max Branning and Stacey Branning (26 March 2010)===\nFollowing [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]]'s ([[Lacey Turner]]) confession to her father-in-law [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) that she murdered [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb (actor)|Larry Lamb]]) (see [[Who Killed Archie?]]), the two characters featured in a two-hander episode on 26 March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a206924/max-comes-face-to-face-with-stacey.html|title=Max comes face-to-face with Stacey|last=Green|first=Kris|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=5 March 2010}}</ref> The killer was kept a secret from all the cast until 30 minutes before a [[EastEnders Live|live episode]] was broadcast on 19 February 2010, meaning that the script for the two-hander episode, written by [[Simon Ashdown]], could not be released until after the broadcast, though later episodes had already been completed.<ref name=\"Stax\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a204893/eastenders-pens-max-stacey-two-hander.html|title='EastEnders' pens Max, Stacey two-hander|last=Green|first=Kris|date=23 February 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=23 February 2010}}</ref> The cast had been told there was a special episode coming up, but that it would actually feature three characters, one being Archie's murderer.<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a210371/jake-wood-max-branning-eastenders.html|title=Jake Wood (Max Branning, 'EastEnders')|last=Green|first=Kris|date=25 March 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> Wood described Ashdown's script as \"amazing\", saying that Ashdown knows the characters inside out, and hoped he could do the script justice.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Wood and Turner were given three days to rehearse.

Stuart becomes suspicious and while Linda is out of the room, he finds a recording device hidden behind the bed, which he reveals to Linda. She calls him stupid, saying he thought she liked him but she was repulsed.

Linda then takes a second recording device she had hidden in her hair and transfers Stuart's confession to her laptop.\n\n==Three and four-hander episodes==\n''EastEnders'' is also notable for featuring three and four-hander episodes.

Executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] described the episode as \"exciting and unique\", and said, \"We realised that three of our most loved female characters had big turning points this week \u2014 Ronnie trying to make the right decision about her relationship with Joel, Dot facing a tough choice about Jim and Bianca finally allowing herself to recognise her true feelings for Ricky. We decided to give those characters [...] some space to thrash out their dilemmas in the form of a (nearly) three-handed episode. Usually when we do a two-hander, we're playing out a story for two characters who are very close, but in this case, unusually, we're featuring characters who don't usually relate to one another. But that is what makes this episode all the more exciting and unique.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a171568/walford-exec-discusses-three-hander.html|title=Walford exec discusses three-hander|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=15 August 2009|accessdate=15 August 2009}}</ref>\n*[[Janine Butcher]], [[Michael Moon (EastEnders)|Michael Moon]] and [[Alice Branning]] (1 November 2013) - Michael had been planning the murder of his wife Janine.

Scripted like mini-plays, [[two-hander]] episodes have become a tradition in ''EastEnders'' over the years, dating back to a groundbreaking episode in 1986, which featured publicans [[Den Watts]] and [[Angie Watts]].<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}</ref> Devoting an entire half an hour of drama to just two characters had previously been unheard of in a bi-weekly serial before this episode aired, but it set a precedent for the programme and it has featured two-handers ever since.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nTypically the episodes feature revelations and major character changes to an important relationship, and intense interactions between two prominent characters. Structuring the episode in this way allows for in-depth focus on a specific character/storyline that would be impossible to achieve in the fast-moving and rapidly cut regular episodes. It also relies on just the one story and two actors to hold the audience for the entire duration of the episode.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nPractically, these episodes were originally created for speedy filming purposes, as while the two actors were filming the two-hander, the remaining cast could be filming another episode. \n\n== Two-hander episodes ==\n===Den and Angie Watts (16 October 1986)===\nThe first two-hander features [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) and [[Angie Watts]] ([[Anita Dobson]]) and is structured like a [[tennis]] match, with a non-speaking window cleaner forever strolling innocently into the action. The episode is written by Jane Hollowood and directed by [[Antonia Bird]].<ref name=\"first10years\"/> This episode was watched by 14.0 million viewers in its original broadcast.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic19861016.shtml Angie - six months to live]\", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 31 October 2006.</ref> Writers chose to give Den and Angie a two-hander episode due to their popularity.<ref>''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07chwf7 From EastEnders to Hollywood: Antonia Bird]'', [[BBC Four]], 26 May 2016.</ref>\n\nDen and Angie's marriage has broken down, and before the episode, Den finally decides to end the marriage and leave Angie for his mistress, [[Jan Hammond]] ([[Jane How]]). The episode begins with Den trying to talk to Angie to tell her that he wants to leave her and get a divorce. Angie stalls but Den persists and explains to her that he wants a clean break from her, their pub, [[The Queen Victoria]], [[Albert Square]] and [[Walford]]. Den tells Angie that he shall get another pub through a deal with [[James Wilmott-Brown]] ([[William Boyde]]) and Jan would be doing the books. Angie is shocked and feels defeated, but she then reveals that she is [[terminally ill]] with only six months to live. Den does not believe her, but Angie explains her story to Den; Angie's hysterical performance eventually convinces him. Den crumbles and promises to stay with her, adding that he will kill Angie if she is lying. Consumed by guilt, Den asks Angie for her forgiveness. As Den leaves Angie alone and takes their dog [[Roly]] for a walk, she gives a deranged smile, revealing that she has been lying to Den.\n\n===Dot Cotton and Ethel Skinner (2 July 1987)===\n\nThe second two-hander features old friends [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]) and [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]), who are babysitting [[Vicki Fowler]] (Emma Herry) one rainy afternoon. This episode centres around nostalgia and growing old and was scripted to show the sadness behind the often comical characters of Dot and Ethel. The episode was written by Charlie Humphreys and directed by [[Mike Gibbon]], a future producer of the show.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nWhile baby Vicki sleeps, Dot and Ethel reminisce about their lives during World War II and share secrets from their girlhoods. During the war Ethel was 17 and remained in London where she witnessed the death of her family,  who were killed by a German [[V-1 flying bomb|doodlebug]]. Dot was [[Emergency evacuation|evacuated]] to Wales when she was three years old and stayed with a couple she called [[List of EastEnders spin-off characters#Gwen|Auntie Gwen]] and [[List of EastEnders spin-off characters#Will|Uncle Will]], who wanted to adopt her. Dot later confessed that she had an abortion soon after she married [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]) because he told her he would leave her if she kept the baby. This caused a furious [[Harold Legg|Dr. Harold Legg]] ([[Leonard Fenton]]) to punch Charlie on the nose in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]]. Towards the end of the episode Dot goes out to the shop for a loaf bread and some fig rolls. When she returns Ethel is asleep and Dot thinks she has died and begins weeping and reciting the [[Lord's Prayer]]. When Ethel rouses, Dot panics and Ethel has to slap her out of it. Ethel then tearfully reminisces about her dead husband [[William Skinner (EastEnders)|William]] and the past. As the episode ends, Dot and Ethel tend to Vicki while singing.\n\n===Sharon Watts and Michelle Fowler (4 April 1989)===\nThe third two-hander featured the best friends [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) and [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]). In the aftermath of Sharon's adoptive father, [[Den Watts]]' ([[Leslie Grantham]]) death, the two friends started an evening at home with a bottle of wine and their memories. This episode was written by [[Tony McHale]] and directed by [[Mike Gibbon]].<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nAfter Den's supposed murder, Sharon - his adoptive daughter - began to speculate about the identity of the mysterious woman who had been seen with him prior to his death. When Sharon told Michelle that she felt that she and her daughter [[Vicki Fowler]] ([[Samantha Leigh Martin]]) were now her family, Michelle blurted out a secret that she'd been keeping for over three years - that Den was Vicki's father and she was the mystery woman who was seen with Den before his death. Michelle thought Sharon would be comforted to know that she was, in a sense, Vicki's sister, and that a part of Den lived on in Vicki. However, Sharon took the news very badly, feeling hurt, angry and deceived. After slapping Michelle and having an emotional showdown, Sharon left their flat wishing that Michelle had never told her.\n\n===Grant and Phil Mitchell (15 November 1994)===\n{{see also|Sharongate}}\nThis episode featured the Mitchell brothers, [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]). Following Grant's discovery that Phil had slept with his wife, [[Sharon Watts|Sharon Mitchell]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), Grant had beaten Phil so badly that he was hospitalised with a dangerous blood clot to the brain. Phil was rushed into surgery, and the clot was removed. As Grant sat with his brother, the two made a pact and promised that they would never let a woman come between them again.\n\nAs Phil awoke from his surgery he found his brother sleeping next to him, holding his hand. Grant awoke and instantly got defensive claiming that he was only there because their friend [[Nigel Bates]] ([[Paul Bradley (British actor)|Paul Bradley]]) had persuaded him. As the two started talking Grant started to reminisce about the past when a girl he was dating came onto Phil and he told him. He asked him if that's what it was like with Sharon. Did she come onto him? And why didn't he tell him? Phil told him it wasn't like that, but Grant kept on calling Sharon a slut and blaming her for the whole affair. He was angry with himself for marrying a slapper. Phil tried to tell him that Sharon was not a slut, but his protests fell on deaf ears. Grant proceeded to ask Phil how easy Sharon was to pull. He wouldn't answer, but Grant persisted saying that he never used to be so bashful. After continual pestering Phil began to get agitated and told Grant that Sharon was easy and he didn't even have to get out of first gear.\n\nThey then began to talk about their relationship, how people used to hate them because they were so close and could do anything together and this was always Sharon's problem. After they reminisced about their many conquests with women Grant returned to the topic of Sharon. He was planning to crush her \"like a table tennis ball\" and make her pay for what she'd done. Phil warned him not to do anything stupid, which angered Grant and he accused him of sticking up for Sharon, but Phil assured him he was merely concerned for his welfare. He persuaded Grant that if the two of them didn't stick together, Grant would end up back in [[prison]]. He promised Grant that he'd do anything for him and as Grant began to weep Phil promised that from now on, it will be just the two of them.\n\n===Pat Butcher and Peggy Mitchell (27 October 1998)===\nThis episode featured [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) and [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]). Peggy was on the warpath after being told about a fabricated affair between her fianc\u00e9 [[Frank Butcher|Frank]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) and his ex-wife Pat. However, Pat had other concerns. Her husband, [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]), had driven off like a suicidal maniac nearly hitting her in the process. As Frank sped off after Roy, Pat and Peggy waited it out in the Evans household and made their feelings to each other clear.\n\nPat was in shock about Roy nearly hitting her, but convinced herself that he merely didn't see her. Peggy was not so sure and commented that running her down was cheaper than divorce, and suggested that Roy had also found out about her affair. Pat insisted that nothing happened between her and Frank, but Peggy took a lot of convincing, and they both traded insults at each other. Pat told Peggy that Frank talked about her a lot, but Peggy couldn't accept this and when Pat left the room for a bath, Peggy began to sob. Pat eventually joined her and Peggy accused her of still loving Frank. Pat didn't quite deny it, but said she has moved on and knows when to give up on something. Peggy was convinced that Frank had feelings for Pat too.\n\nAfter opening a bottle of wine Pat began to feel sorry for herself, saying that she was cursed and turned rich, happy men into disasters - Roy was broke and [[impotent]], whereas Frank who has spent a couple of years away from her, was back to his old virile self. Peggy was amazed to discover that Roy was impotent and Pat was quick to point out that sex wasn't important and she was happy to have finally found a man who wanted her to settle down.\n\nAfter the police arrived to inform Pat that their search for Roy had been fruitless, Peggy pestered them for some information, which made her suspect that Roy had come to harm. Now feeling more sympathetic Peggy went to converse with Pat, but the atmosphere soon became frosty once again when each began to recount their wonderful times with Frank. Pat stuck the knife in further by saying that she could have slept with Frank if she'd wanted to the night before, he still fancied her and the least encouragement would have sufficed. The bitching continued with Pat branding Peggy \"mutton dressed as lamb\" and Peggy blaming Pat's appearance for Roy's impotence. Their rowing finally descended into violence as both ladies threw wine glasses at each other and then a fight started when Peggy grabbed the edge of the kitchen table and threw it over to clear the way to attack Pat. The episode ended with Pat slapping Peggy, saying \"YOU BITCH!\" and Peggy slapping Pat right back, exclaiming \"YOU COW!\", right before the doorbell rang.\n\n===Roy Evans and Frank Butcher (29 October 1998)===\n\nOccurring simultaneously to the [[Pat Butcher|Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St Clement]]) and [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]) two-hander described above, this episode featured [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]) and [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]). After Roy sped off nearly hitting Pat with his car, Frank followed him and forced him to rethink a drastic decision.\n\nFrank followed Roy's car as he sped off extremely erratically. Eventually, Roy turned into a [[multi-storey car park]], drove to the top and crashed the car into some rubble. He then made his way to the roof, and stood on the edge contemplating [[suicide]]. Frank followed and tried to persuade him to get down, saying he should think about his family, who will blame themselves and about Pat who thinks that he tried to kill her earlier. Roy claimed that he didn't see her, but added that it was all hopeless and he had lost everything, so there was no point living. Frank pointed out that he had a family who loved him and money was not important. Frank eventually persuaded him to come down to talk, promising that if he felt the same afterwards, he would bring him back and not stop him from taking his own life. Roy agreed and the two of them went to a strip club and ordered a couple of brandies. Roy continued to explain the reason for his depression. He had been conned in a car deal and was facing bankruptcy. Frank told Roy that they had more in common than he might think, as he once tried to commit suicide too, was left bankrupt and he made the mistake of not going back to Pat then, but for Roy it wasn't too late.\n\nRoy felt that Pat was still in love with Frank, and then accidentally let slip about his impotency, which only humiliated him further. Frank was understanding and promised he wouldn't tell anyone, and he in turn shared a story with Roy, relaying that he had fathered a child with some young girl he met when he had his breakdown, and no one else knew. Roy was comforted to know that Frank had skeletons in his closet too, and eventually agreed to go home. Frank drove them back, they rang the bell at the Evanses just as Peggy and Pat's fight was in full flow. Pat was thrilled to see Roy, and Peggy a little less thrilled to see Frank, so he asked her if they were still engaged. She responded \"Just\".\n\n===Matthew Rose and Steve Owen (3 February 2000)=== <!-- Linked from Tom Hooper (director) -->\nThis episode featured [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]) and [[Matthew Rose (EastEnders)|Matthew Rose]] ([[Joe Absolom]]). Steve had let Matthew serve time in prison for [[Saskia Duncan]]'s (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor) murder. Upon his release Matthew came to Walford looking for revenge. 19.8 million viewers watched this episode.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic20000203.shtml \"Matthew's revenge\"]\", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 31 October 2006.</ref>\n\nWhen Matthew turned up at e20 nightclub Steve was shocked by the visible transformation and could see that Matthew was seeking revenge. Matthew produced a video - he had rigged Steve's flat with booby traps and Steve knew it was only a matter of time before his sister [[Jackie Owen]] ([[Race Davies]]) arrived home to trigger them. Matthew demanded \u00a310,000. Steve tried to gain the upper hand by pulling his gun from the safe, but Matthew was one step ahead and had already removed the [[bullet]]s. As they struggled Matthew grabbed a bottle and knocked Steve unconscious. He then tied and bound him to the chair.\n\nWhen Steve came to he tried to use a piece of smashed bottle to free himself, and managed to grab hold of the gun Matthew was waving in his face. He demanded that Matthew remove the booby traps from his flat. However Matthew stopped Steve in his tracks by revealing that he had killed Saskia's sister, [[Claudia Fielding|Claudia]] (Romla Walker), and framed him for the deed, just as he had done to him. Steve buckled and fell to the floor, unable to take in what was happening. He began to beg and cry, whilst Matthew splattered [[petrol]] around the room and then pulled a [[Zippo|zippo lighter]] from his pocket. As he lit the lighter and dropped it to the floor Steve was gripped with fear. However he soon realised that there was no fire or smoke. Matthew had used water instead of petrol and had invented the whole scenario to belittle him and watch him beg for mercy.\n\n===Ricky Butcher and Phil Mitchell (20 April 2000)===\nThis episode featured [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) and his long-time employer [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). After losing his wife [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]); son [[Liam Butcher|Liam]] (Jack & Tom Godolphin); and finally his mind, Ricky said an emotional farewell to Albert Square - while Phil tried to talk him out of leaving.\n\nRicky had sped out of Walford in his car and been involved in an accident. Phil went after him and passed the police retrieving the wreck of Ricky's car. They told him to go to the police station. Phil arrived and Ricky appeared - he had been caught over the limit doing {{convert|90|mph}} when he crashed.\n\nRicky was furious with Phil for allowing him to work on dodgy motors at The Arches, and was even more annoyed when he discovered that the car he had totalled was stolen. Ricky threatened to go back to the station to tell the police everything. Phil forced him to get into the car, but whilst he was being driven away he told Phil that he was not going home, and started fighting with Phil in order to get him to stop. The car swerved dangerously and Phil was forced to stop at the next service station.\n\nPhil tried to explain the situation with the car-scam, saying that he only got involved to bail [[Roy Evans (EastEnders)|Roy Evans]] ([[Tony Caunter]]) out and it was just a favour. Ricky was furious that he could have been jailed for helping Phil. Ricky felt that there was nothing to go back to Walford for. He had lost his wife and son and was devastated that Bianca was seeing another man. Ricky was also hurt because he had trusted Phil - he was the only thing that held him together over the last few weeks, but now he could no longer trust him. As he went to leave Phil chased him and tried to stop him leaving. However Ricky refused to let Phil push him around and informed Phil that he had purposefully driven his car into the back of the truck. Phil tried to reason that he had also lost his family. He had managed to turn his life around and Ricky could do the same. Phil tried to make Ricky think of the ramifications of his departure - Pat would dump Roy, Frank would go mad and run away again, and Phil would be dumped in it with the police. Ricky didn't care and as he began to walk off Phil shouted after him that everyone needs him to stay, and he was Ricky's friend and was there for him when he found out his unborn baby, who was named Natasha, had [[spina bifida]]. The memory stirred up buried emotions in Ricky, and as he burst into tears Phil embraced him.\n\nAs dawn began to break Phil tried to coerce Ricky home by offering him partnership in The Arches. He also promised to take the rap for the dodgy motor that Ricky was driving and to sort out his nemesis [[Dan Sullivan (EastEnders)|Dan Sullivan]] ([[Craig Fairbrass]]) for him. Phil apologized for all the things he'd done to Ricky in the past, but wanted the chance to make it up to him and turn things around. Ricky begrudgingly accepted, but when Phil left briefly to make a quick phone call, Ricky decided that he couldn't return to Walford. While Phil's back was turned, he asked a lorry driver for a lift and departed.\n\n===Kat and Zoe Slater (2 October 2001)===\nThis episode features [[Kat Slater]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and her daughter [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]), who up until this moment has lived her life thinking that Kat is her sister. In the previous episode, Zoe announces that she is leaving Walford to live with her uncle, [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry Slater]] ([[Michael Elphick]]), in [[Spain]], but Kat is adamant that she will not. A screaming row in the street ensues and Zoe shouts \"You can't tell me what to do, you ain't my mother!\", to which Kat's desperate reply is, \"Yes I am!\". 16.9 million viewers tuned in for this episode.<ref>\"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/eastenders/eastenders/episodes/classic_content/classic20011001.shtml \"You're not my mother...\"]\", ''BBC''. URL last accessed on 31 October 2006.</ref>\n\nThis episode began with Zoe still reeling from Kat's outburst. Back at the Slaters', Zoe demanded to know what Kat meant. Kat tried to take back what she had said, but after continuous pestering, she finally relented and admitted that what she said was the truth. This devastated Zoe, and while she locked herself in her room distraught, Kat sat outside and began to explain the reason for the deception. She had fallen pregnant when she was 13, and her parents, disappointed and ashamed, forced her to hand Zoe over to them at birth. They proceeded to bring her up as their own child. Kat relayed her heartache at having to watch her own child being brought up by her parents, and the anxiety she felt at having to pretend that she was her sister for her whole life. The lies and deception were too much for Zoe, and when she discovered that Kat had wanted to abort her, the two lashed out at each other in fury.\n\nThe news made Zoe all the more determined to live with her uncle Harry in Spain, and upon hearing this Kat dropped her second bombshell - she couldn't go and live with Harry because he was her father. Kat's uncle had sexually abused her as a child, leaving her pregnant with Zoe. This meant that Zoe's father was simultaneously her great uncle.\n\n===Sonia Jackson and Dot Branning (9 May 2002)===\nThis episode featured [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia Jackson]] ([[Natalie Cassidy]]) and her step-grandmother [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]). Sonia had kidnapped the daughter she had given up for adoption and was keeping her hidden away at the Brannings'. Dot tried to reason with Sonia and shared a secret of her own.\n\nWith [[Rebecca Miller (EastEnders)|Rebecca Miller]] asleep upstairs, Sonia ransacked the house for money in order to make her getaway. Dot frantically knocked at the door, shouting that Rebecca's adoptive parents, [[Neil Miller (EastEnders)|Neil Miller]] (Robin Sneller) and [[Sue Miller (EastEnders)|Sue Miller]] ([[Victoria Willing]]), were going to call the police unless Sonia let her in. Sonia tried to deny Rebecca was there, but Dot knew otherwise and made it clear that she was there to retrieve the baby for the Millers. Sonia became distressed by this, arguing that as she was Rebecca's mother she can look after her. The Millers had given Dot a deadline, she had 15 minutes to persuade Sonia to surrender Rebecca or they would involve the police.\n\nSonia tried to explain herself. The Millers had planned to take Rebecca away without granting her a last visit. She was also upset at how much her baby had changed since she was born and she had decided that she wanted her back. Dot argued that she couldn't change her mind now that Rebecca had been adopted and she no longer had any rights as her mother. When Dot instructed Sonia to take Rebecca outside, she threatened to abscond with the baby. She begged Dot to stall the police so she could escape via the back door and was furious when Dot refused. Dot proceeded to point out that Sonia had missed out on 18 months of Rebecca's life and that she hardly knew her daughter now. Despite her pleas, Dot refused to help Sonia - and threatened to call the police herself if the kidnapping continued.\n\nSonia became inconsolable. Dot tried to reassure her that everything would be alright, she just needed some inner strength. Sonia became angry with Dot for living her life by the Bible and Dot was mortified when she threw the holy book across the room. Sonia wondered why Dot was so willing to help her criminal son [[Nick Cotton]] ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]), but wouldn't help her. Dot explained that she helped Nick because she had something to make up for. She had an abortion when she was 21 years old. Her husband [[Charlie Cotton]] ([[Christopher Hancock]]) had forced her to terminate the pregnancy against her wishes. Dot described how guilty she felt after the abortion. She thought she had put it all behind her until the christening gown was found buried in the garden of [[Mark Fowler]]'s ([[Todd Carty]]) house. She wished she had kept the baby, now she's left feeling cold and empty. Sonia wondered whether she should have been a single mum like her own mother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]). She relayed that Carol was furious about the adoption, but Dot reassured her that Rebecca would have a good life with the Millers.\n\nJust as the Millers decided to call the police, Rebecca began to cry. When Sonia was unable to console her she finally realised that it was time to give her up. Tearfully, she passed Rebecca over to her relieved parents.\n\n===Phil Mitchell and Sharon Watts (5 September 2002)===\nThis episode featured the ex-lovers [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]). Sharon and Phil had a heart to heart about their troubled pasts. They laid ghosts to rest and agreed to move on with their lives.\n\nSharon and Phil were simultaneously having problems in their relationships. Sharon had fallen out with [[Tom Banks (EastEnders)|Tom Banks]] ([[Colm \u00d3 Maonla\u00ed]]), due to malicious stirring from his ex-wife Sadie  (Isobel Middleton), and Phil had given [[Lisa Fowler]] ([[Lucy Benjamin]]) an ultimatum - she was to leave her husband [[Mark Fowler]] ([[Todd Carty]]) before the day was over. As Phil waited for Lisa to arrive in the middle of the night, he heard a knock at the door of [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]]. He opened the door expecting to find Lisa, but found Sharon instead.\n\nSharon declared that she and Tom were over. Phil accused her of being stroppy and spoilt and she retaliated by accusing him of using Lisa so he could get his hands on their daughter, [[Louise Mitchell]] (Rachel Cox). The ex-lovers began drinking and flirting and talked about their past relationship. As they talked Phil relaxed and opened up about his father. Phil relayed how he idolised his father but that all changed when he saw how badly he treated his mother. He admitted that his deepest wish was to be a good father and expressed his sorrow that his two children were living with other men. Phil began to shake with emotion as he recalled the beatings he received from his father, whilst his brother [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) could do no wrong. After one horrific Christmas, Phil vowed to run away and he still carried the note he was going to leave his parents. He never did run away, but the violence continued until he was big enough to fight back. Sharon had also had issues with her parents. She loved them both, but was caught in the middle of their volatile marriage. After they rowed, they used to compete with each other for her affections.\n\nSharon then realised that they both had to stop living in the past. She decided to sell her share in The Queen Vic as it reminded her of her parents and Grant. Phil agreed to buy her out. Sharon then urged Phil to put his troubled relationship with his father behind him. Their heart to heart helped her to realise that she wanted to make a go of things with Tom. As Sharon left, Phil took the note that he wrote when he was a boy out of his pocket. He set it on fire to signify that it was time for him to move on too.\n\n===Little Mo and Trevor Morgan (31 October 2002)===\nThis episode featured [[Little Mo Mitchell|Little Mo Morgan]] ([[Kacey Ainsworth]]) and her abusive husband [[Trevor Morgan (EastEnders)|Trevor Morgan]] ([[Alex Ferns]]). It was the night of Little Mo and [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]]'s ([[Perry Fenwick]]) engagement party. Trevor snatched Little Mo from the party at ''Angie's Den'' and imprisoned her in the Slater house. To make matters worse, Trevor's baby son Sean was his other hostage.\n\nTrevor had imprisoned Little Mo in the Slater house. He called her stupid for believing he'd ever grant her a divorce. Ominously, he reminded her of their marriage vows - including \"till death us do part\". Trevor began to weep as he admitted he was totally obsessed with Little Mo. He was furious that she had been unfaithful to him with Billy and reminded her that she will always be his. Little Mo was disgusted and wondered how Trevor had ended up in such a pitiful state. The early years of their marriage had been happy - so why did Trevor start beating her? He explained that he couldn't stand sharing her and resented the time she spent caring for her sick mother, [[Viv Slater|Viv]] (Debi Gibson). He never liked Viv, and was glad when she died. Trevor raged that it wasn't enough for him to be part of her family, he wanted to be all of it.\n\nTrevor then turned violent, pushed Little Mo against the wall and reminded her that he'd kill her if she ever slept with another man. Terrified, Little Mo tried to escape but found that all the doors were locked. She ran upstairs in a panic, but Trevor followed and threw her to the ground saying that she will never hurt him again. Half-crazed with anger, Trevor barked questions at Little Mo, forcing her to admit that it was morally wrong for her, as his wife, to sleep with another man. He claimed that Billy couldn't possibly love her like he did. His questions took on an intimate nature and as he made a move towards Little Mo she recoiled in fear, but Trevor then declared there was no time for that, he had other plans for her. After calmly leaving the room, Little Mo followed to find Trevor pouring petrol on the stairs and suddenly she heard baby Sean crying upstairs. Out of desperation, Little Mo claimed that she still loved Trevor and she had never wanted a divorce. Thinking fast, she blamed Billy for turning her against him. She tore off her engagement ring and threw it away. Trevor slumped to the ground, eager to believe that she still loved him. Little Mo beckoned to him and they embraced. As she cradled him in her arms he sobbed that he never meant to hurt her.\n\nLittle Mo suggested they go away together, but that she first needed to return Sean to his mother. When Trevor tried to get romantic, Little Mo shrieked and shook him off. Realising that he was being fooled, Trevor turned violent and Little Mo froze with fear, but seeing Billy's ring on the carpet gave her courage. She stared at Trevor and proclaimed that she wasn't frightened of him anymore. She told him that she could see him for what he was - a coward and a bully. Shocked at her defiance, Trevor whispered that she should be scared, but Little Mo was defiant and told him that he didn't have the guts to go through with his threat. She lit a match forcing an alarmed Trevor to grab it from her. In his haste the match fell to the floor and flames began to fill the room, Trevor was killed though Little Mo and the baby survived.\n\n===Lisa Fowler and Phil Mitchell (27 March 2003)===\nThis episode featured [[Lisa Fowler]] ([[Lucy Benjamin]]) and her ex-boyfriend [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) in flashbacks to October 2002 while Phil recounts the events to [[Kate Mitchell|Kate Morton]] ([[Jill Halfpenny]]). After Lisa abducted Phil's daughter and fled to [[Portugal]], Phil tracked her down and was adamant that he was returning to Walford with his daughter. Phil had been suspected of killing Lisa and had her blood on his jacket and had burned her passport when he returned the UK. Kate was eager to get the truth and asked outright if Phil had killed Lisa.\n\nAfter fleeing from Phil, Lisa was trapped at the edge of a cliff grasping their daughter, [[Louise Mitchell]] (Rachel Cox). Phil implored her to move away from the cliff edge, but Lisa was terrified and yelled at Phil to get away from her. Phil stepped back and urged Lisa to consider Louise's safety and slowly, Lisa moved away from the edge.\n\nLisa saw a man walking his dog and shouted in vain for help. Her yelling made Louise cry and Lisa tried to calm her with a lullaby. Phil was biding his time and refused to leave without Louise. Lisa finally began to calm down so Phil led to her to an abandoned cottage so they could talk. As they settled inside Phil remarked how beautiful his daughter was, and paid the same compliment to Lisa. He told Lisa that he missed them both so much. Lisa was suspicious, but after continual pressure she allowed Phil to hold Louise.\n\nPhil tried to persuade Lisa that children need their fathers', and whilst Lisa admitted that she missed her own father she insisted that neither of them were going back with Phil. Phil tried to keep her talking, he questioned her about her father. Lisa confessed that she had a recurring dream involving her dad. As she recalled the dream, she becomes highly distraught and informed him that it involved coffins and babies. Phil found this disturbing and did his best to convince Lisa that she wasn't well. He offered to arrange the professional help that she obviously needed, but Lisa accused Phil of trying to trap her into returning to England. Phil immediately got defensive, he continued his mind games and managed to make Lisa consider that a life in Portugal, with an unskilled, jobless mother was not appropriate for their daughter. Phil fired question after question at Lisa, and the continual probing began to baffle Lisa. As he saw it, she had no money and no plans. It was not enough to merely love her daughter if she couldn't provide for her. He told her that babies need stability and their first year was hugely important. Lisa had moved from man to man, and from one place to another in that time. Distressed, Lisa put her hands over her ears, whilst Phil continued to rant that she was not fit to look after a dog, let alone a baby. He declared that Lisa was mentally unstable and Louise was not safe with her. Phil urged Lisa to do what was best for Louise.\n\nExhausted by Phil's personal attacks, Lisa fell quiet. Phil then stated calmly that if she tried to stop him taking Louise, he'd have her committed. Lisa protested that the only mad thing she had ever done was get involved with him, but Phil proceeded to plants doubts in her mind. He reminded her that she shot him and left him for dead and asked if that was how a sane person behaved. Lisa was visibly distressed and shaking. Sensing that the moment was right, Phil ordered her to fetch Louise and hand her over to him. Bewildered, Lisa obeyed him. He then announced that it was best if Lisa didn't ever try to return to Walford. He was prepared to reveal all about the shooting if she did.\n\nLisa staggered outside in confusion and grief. Phil ignored her howls of anguish and walked away with Louise whilst Lisa stared over the edge of the cliff.\n\n===Den and Sharon Watts (30 September 2003)===\nThis episode reunited [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) with his adoptive daughter [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), after she'd spent 14 years thinking that he was dead. Sharon had the shock of her life when her father emerged from the shadows and muttered \"Hello, Princess!\". Sharon couldn't believe that her father was still alive. Den did his best to explain where he'd been, but Sharon was torn between delight and anger.\n\nSharon touched Den, dumbstruck to see her dad after all these years, but before she had a chance to take it in she began to feel nauseous and ran to the toilet to be violently sick. Upon her return, Den proceeded to try to explain himself. Sharon stared in disbelief and wanted to know how he could let her think that he was dead all this time. As emotions began to run high, Sharon revealed that she'd never stopped grieving for him. Den explained that he couldn't take the risk in contacting her, or they would have both been in danger. Den only felt safe to return to Walford after hearing that [[Jack Dalton (EastEnders)|Jack Dalton]] ([[Hywel Bennett]]) - a gangster associated with his attempted murder - had died. He apologised to Sharon for never having the guts to get in touch. Sharon sobbed as she recalled the last conversation she ever had with him. She washed her hands of him, and the next thing she knew he was dead. She'd regretted her harsh words ever since, she thought he'd died thinking that she hated him. Sharon confessed that she'd made a mess of her life. Things would have been easier if he'd been around. Just his voice on the end of the phone would have helped. Den had tears in his eyes as he hugged Sharon.\n\nAs the two began to bond, Den brought the conversation round to his first wife and Sharon's adoptive mother, [[Angie Watts]] ([[Anita Dobson]]) and offended Sharon by referring to her as a \"barmy old lush\". Sharon announced that Angie had died. Den didn't even know. Furious, Sharon then decided it was too late for Den to make amends, and yelled at him to leave her alone. Den did as she wanted and wandered though the Square, before breaking into The Queen Vic, the pub he used to own. Den surveyed the pub and Sharon followed him inside. They drank a toast to Angie and Sharon revealed how she nursed her mum during the painful final days of her fatal illness. Den reflected that he had some good times in the pub, but Sharon could not remember many good times \u2013 she just recalled her parents' furious rows. She mentioned how she once ran it with [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), whom Den had never even heard of. Sharon then remembered that she had an axe to grind with her father, for getting her best friend [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]) pregnant when she was only 16. Den tried to explain what happened between him and Michelle, but Sharon was furious with him for cheating on her mother and blamed him for sending her to an early grave.\n\nSharon decided that she was not going to allow Den to ruin her life again. Den tried to calm her, but she insisted that she, [[Vicki Fowler]] ([[Scarlett Johnson]]) and [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]) didn't need him. Den assumed that Dennis was Sharon's boyfriend and told her he wasn't important. Then Sharon revealed that he wasn't her boyfriend, Dennis was his son.\n\n===Den Watts and Dennis Rickman (1 April 2004)===\nThis episode featured [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) and [[Dennis Rickman]] ([[Nigel Harman]]). Father and son went head to head in The Queen Vic. Both were desperate to win the battle. It ended with violence, and one being the definite loser.\n\nDen had just discovered that his adoptive daughter, [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]), was sleeping with his son, Dennis. He was not happy. In The Queen Vic, Den took Dennis aside for a chat. Dennis sat down with trepidation but was amazed that Den was so calm. He explained that he and Sharon were in love, but Den had doubts. With Dennis showing no signs of budging, Den reluctantly decided to that Dennis had to be forced away from Sharon rather than persuaded. When Dennis referred to their bonding chat last Christmas and that he was glad that Den now knew about him and Sharon, Den mocked him cruelly, claiming that their prior bonding was all an act. He was only pretending when he acted fatherly towards him and didn't care about him in the slightest. Dennis was hurt and taken aback and as Den belittled him further, remembering the way Dennis melted when he called him \"son\", Dennis became enraged. Den continued his diatribe on Dennis, threatening to inform Sharon that he had killed [[Jack Dalton (EastEnders)|Jack Dalton]] ([[Hywel Bennett]]), but it wasn't enough to scare Dennis off.\n\nDen continued to goad him, asking how long it would be before he turned his attentions to his biological sister, [[Vicki Fowler]] ([[Scarlett Johnson]]), and Dennis was sickened by the remark. Den argued that Dennis couldn't tell the difference between female relatives and lovers. He taunted Dennis about his background, telling him that years of misery and abuse had turned him into the man that he was. Dennis managed to remain calm and was sure that Den was closer to losing his temper than he was. Dennis said he realised that they would always be at loggerheads with each other. He had let Den triumph before, because he thought he wanted a father, but even though Den had put up a good fight, he wasn't going to let him win this time. Den became enraged and asserted that his and Sharon's affair was over. He ordered Dennis to leave, but Dennis replied repeatedly that he loved Sharon. Calmly, he prepared to head home to her. Seeing that he was losing the fight Den turned angry and hurled Dennis through the doors of The Queen Vic. Father and son stood head to head, while Dennis bragged about Sharon leaving with him. Cockily, he shoved his father aside. Furious, Den spat out that some twisted pervert must have got to Dennis in the past, and caused him to think that a relationship with his own sister was acceptable. He described the abuse Dennis must have suffered in care and waved goodbye to the son he never wanted. Dennis finally snapped and lunged at him out of control, but was restrained. Eventually he broke free and lashed out, accidentally punching Sharon, who had just arrived, in the process. A victorious Den then took Sharon home.\n\n===Kat Slater and Alfie Moon (25 May 2004)===\nThis episode featured [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) and [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]). Alfie had been given a video of [[Andy Hunter (EastEnders)|Andy Hunter]] ([[Michael Higgs]]) sleeping with his wife, Kat. Alfie owed Andy money and when he couldn't pay he Andy threatened his safety. Kat slept with Andy as a trade for her husband's life, but Alfie could not accept her excuses.\n\nThe episode began with a jovial Kat returning home, but her mood soon changed after she saw that Andy had filmed their sordid liaison and maliciously given it to Alfie to watch. Alfie was in pieces and couldn't bear to look at his wife. As Kat pleaded with Alfie to listen to her explanation, he refused, so Kat screamed that she did it all for him. Alfie was disgusted and called her a cheap little slapper. Hurt, Kat slapped Alfie and he slapped her right back, leaving Kat stunned that he could do such a thing.\n\nAs it all sunk in Alfie broke down in tears, whilst Kat desperately tried to protest that Andy tricked her. Alfie could only laugh at her feeble excuse. She told him that she did it to protect him and because she loved him, but Alfie felt hurt and betrayed. He suggested that she go back to Andy, as he didn't want her anywhere near him. Through his tears and anguish Alfie  revealed the guilt he'd always carried about his parents' death in a car crash and how he blamed himself for not fixing something his dad asked him to. Now he can't live with the thought that his negligence ruined things again. He told Kat that their marriage was over and Kat had no choice but to pack her bags. As she was about to go Alfie questioned her more about her motives and Kat tried to make him realise that Andy's behaviour was all about revenge and that they can get past this and stay together. As Alfie continued to reject her, Kat turned on him and brought up her past sexual abuse at the hands of her uncle [[Harry Slater (EastEnders)|Harry Slater]] ([[Michael Elphick]]) and likened it to her affair with Andy. Sobbing, she made one last attempt to change his mind and asked him to give her a cuddle. However, Alfie's pride wouldn't let him take her back and he showed her the door.\n\nAs Kat left The Queen Vic in tears she heard the door open and saw Alfie there. She held out her hand and he took it. They agreed that it would be tough, but decided to try to find a way to work things out.\n\n===Den Watts and Dot Branning (26 August 2004)===\nThis episode featured long-time neighbours, [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) and [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]). Den's wife had left him following his affair, and his relationship with his son was in tatters after he propositioned his girlfriend. Meanwhile, Dot was arguing with her husband, [[Jim Branning]] ([[John Bardon]]) and was very reluctant to tell him about her secret cancer illness. Den and Dot forced each other to examine their relationships with others.\n\nLate one evening Den spotted some youths vandalising the launderette. After seeing off the thugs, Dot emerged from the back room and Den could see that she had been crying.\n\nDot began to engage Den in conversation about his wife [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy-Ann Oberman]]) and how he felt now that she had left him. Den's response was blas\u00e9, which angered Dot and she accused him of putting up a front. Dot chastised Den for his demeanour and pointed out that he couldn't face up to his own guilt. She told him that he treated his friends and family appallingly and when he had heard enough and turned to leave, he found that Dot had locked him in and refused to give him the keys. As Den was forced to continue the conversation Dot pestered him more about Chrissie and threatened to haunt him if he didn't plead Chrissie for forgiveness.\n\nEventually, Dot informed Den that she was dying and he was shocked to hear that she had [[kidney cancer]]. However Dot became cagey when Den quizzed her about her illness. He wanted her to have the best care possible and even offered to pay for it, but Dot rejected his help - she had chosen not to have her cancer treated. She wanted to face death with dignity and begged Den to keep her secret quiet as even her husband, Jim, didn't know she was suffering.\nDen wasn't convinced by Dot's motives for keeping her illness from Jim, but she believed that she was acting in his best interests. Den insisted that Dot's deceit would destroy her marriage and told her to open up to Jim. Den then slyly told her that if she didn't come clean with Jim, she couldn't take the moral high ground next time he messed up. They both decided that they needed to sort their marriages out.\n\nWhen Jim arrived to collect Dot, Den explained that she was sorting him out and squeezed Dot's hand tenderly before leaving. At home Den apologised to his son and heeding Dot's advice, he bit the bullet and called Chrissie. Meanwhile, Dot took Den's advice and decided that it was time to come clean to Jim.\n\n===Sonia Fowler and Martin Fowler (5 January 2007)===\nFollowing the death of [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) [[Martin Fowler]] confronts [[Sonia Fowler]] about her admission that she killed Pauline.

As Sonia tries to explain the circumstances surrounding her hitting Pauline, Martin refuses to believe her or accept her apologies. Believing Sonia to be guilty of murder, Martin calls the police and takes their daughter [[Rebecca Fowler]] home, telling Sonia she won't be seeing her daughter again. The police arrive and Sonia is arrested as the residents of Walford look on.\n\n===Max Branning and Stacey Branning (26 March 2010)===\nFollowing [[Stacey Slater|Stacey Branning]]'s ([[Lacey Turner]]) confession to her father-in-law [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) that she murdered [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb (actor)|Larry Lamb]]) (see [[Who Killed Archie?]]), the two characters featured in a two-hander episode on 26 March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a206924/max-comes-face-to-face-with-stacey.html|title=Max comes face-to-face with Stacey|last=Green|first=Kris|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=5 March 2010}}</ref> The killer was kept a secret from all the cast until 30 minutes before a [[EastEnders Live|live episode]] was broadcast on 19 February 2010, meaning that the script for the two-hander episode, written by [[Simon Ashdown]], could not be released until after the broadcast, though later episodes had already been completed.<ref name=\"Stax\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a204893/eastenders-pens-max-stacey-two-hander.html|title='EastEnders' pens Max, Stacey two-hander|last=Green|first=Kris|date=23 February 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=23 February 2010}}</ref> The cast had been told there was a special episode coming up, but that it would actually feature three characters, one being Archie's murderer.<ref name=\"Green\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a210371/jake-wood-max-branning-eastenders.html|title=Jake Wood (Max Branning, 'EastEnders')|last=Green|first=Kris|date=25 March 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref> Wood described Ashdown's script as \"amazing\", saying that Ashdown knows the characters inside out, and hoped he could do the script justice.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Wood and Turner were given three days to rehearse.

Max tells her that he wants to hand her in to the police. Max then chases Stacey outside, where she trips and he catches her. He then drags Stacey to a car, which he breaks into and bundles her into. He then hot-wires the car and drives to a police station. After telling Stacey that she must confess to her mother and the [[Mitchell family|Mitchells]] first, he drives her back to [[Walford]] where he eventually changes his mind after expressing that Bradley would want her to be happy.

Although their scenes are interspersed with scenes of [[Dot Cotton|Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) at home waiting for her cat, and the episode credits 20 characters, it was officially considered a two-hander by [[BBC Store]] and was included in their \"''EastEnders'': Two's Company\" collection of two-hander episodes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://store.bbc.com/collections/eastenders-twos-company|title=EastEnders: Two's Company|publisher=[[BBC Store]]|accessdate=21 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Phil Mitchell and Jay Brown (21 August 2017) ===\nDuring this episode, [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) explains to [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) why he has given him the car lot, which is worth \u00a3300,000 rather than giving it to his son [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] ([[Harry Reid (actor)|Harry Reid]]), who received the lesser valued Arches. Phil tells Jay that [[Jase Dyer]] ([[Stephen Lord]]) was not his biological father as he didn't know Jay's mother until two months after his birth. Phil tells Jay that a tramp living rough around Albert Square, named Alan Hall, was his birth father and that in an insurance scam back in 1994 he and [[Frank Butcher]] ([[Mike Reid (actor)|Mike Reid]]) committed arson to the car lot and that they weren't aware Alan was sleeping in one of the cars within. Phil attempts to persuade Jay that there would be no point in going to prison because he is still paying for the crime in the form of guilt. At the end of the episode Jay is seen sat at \"Jase's bench\" while Phil is seen making a phone call to an unknown person, he tells them that he's \"done it\" and \"fed him [Jay] a pack of lies and that it's now their turn to keep to the deal\".\n\n=== Linda Carter and Stuart Highway (13 December 2018) ===\nA two-hander between [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]) and [[Stuart Highway (EastEnders)|Stuart Highway]] ([[Ricky Champ]]).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2018-12-02/linda-and-stuart-to-kiss-kellie-bright-previews-eastenders-two-hander-episode/|title=Linda and Stuart to KISS!

In this episode, Linda seduces Stuart and during their passion, she says Mick used to have an unpredictable energy like Stuart does now, and would have believed he shot someone back then but not now in an attempt to gain a confession. Stuart becomes suspicious and while Linda is out of the room, he finds a recording device hidden behind the bed, which he reveals to Linda. She calls him stupid, saying he thought she liked him but she was repulsed.

He attempts to rape her but she smashes a bottle on his head, saying he would never have the nerve to pull the trigger but Mick would, to which Stuart says Mick did not shoot him and he leaves. Linda then takes a second recording device she had hidden in her hair and transfers Stuart's confession to her laptop.\n\n==Three and four-hander episodes==\n''EastEnders'' is also notable for featuring three and four-hander episodes. Within three-hander episodes three characters usually interact separately with each other in differing scenes, whilst four-handers often include two sets of characters stories which occur simultaneously, although they are not directly connected to each other there is usually a linking theme.\n\n===Notable three-handers===\n* [[Kathy Beale]], [[Pete Beale]] and [[James Willmott-Brown]] (13 February 1992) - Kathy finally laid to rest the ghost of her rape and convinced Pete that their marriage was truly over.\n* [[Sharon Watts]], [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] and [[Phil Mitchell]] (3 September 1992) - After Phil had slept with his brother's wife, Sharon, the protagonists had to deal with the aftermath and the possibility that Grant would discover what had happened.

Executive producer [[Diederick Santer]] described the episode as \"exciting and unique\", and said, \"We realised that three of our most loved female characters had big turning points this week \u2014 Ronnie trying to make the right decision about her relationship with Joel, Dot facing a tough choice about Jim and Bianca finally allowing herself to recognise her true feelings for Ricky. We decided to give those characters [...] some space to thrash out their dilemmas in the form of a (nearly) three-handed episode. Usually when we do a two-hander, we're playing out a story for two characters who are very close, but in this case, unusually, we're featuring characters who don't usually relate to one another. But that is what makes this episode all the more exciting and unique.\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a171568/walford-exec-discusses-three-hander.html|title=Walford exec discusses three-hander|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=15 August 2009|accessdate=15 August 2009}}</ref>\n*[[Janine Butcher]], [[Michael Moon]] and [[Alice Branning]] (1 November 2013) - Michael had been planning the murder of his wife Janine.

As Janine and Michael play power games with one another and try to manipulate Alice into taking sides, Michael panics when police are called.

The drink took hold and they finished the night in bed. Meanwhile, Cindy and David had met up away from Walford to conduct their affair, but the night was ruined when a familiar face spotted them and Cindy feared that her husband may be informed about her misconduct.

{"title_page": "Accelerated depreciation", "text_new": "{{Globalize|date=September 2011}}\n'''Accelerated depreciation''' refers to any one of several methods by which a company, for 'financial accounting' or [[tax]] purposes, [[depreciation|depreciates]] a [[fixed asset]] in such a way that the amount of depreciation taken each year is higher during the earlier years of an asset's life.  For financial accounting purposes, accelerated depreciation is expected to be much more productive during its early years, so that depreciation  [[expense]] will more accurately represent how much of an asset's usefulness is being used up each year.  For tax purposes, accelerated depreciation provides a way of deferring [[corporate income taxes]] by reducing [[taxable income]] in current years, in exchange for increased taxable income in future years.  This is a valuable tax incentive that encourages businesses to purchase new assets.   \n\nFor [[financial reporting]] purposes, the two most popular methods of accelerated depreciation are the '''double declining balance''' method and the [[Rule of 78s|'''sum-of-the-years\u2019 digits''']] method.{{fact|date=December 2012}}  For tax purposes, the allowable methods of accelerated depreciation depend on the tax law that the taxpayer is subject to.  In the United States, the two currently allowable depreciation methods for tax purposes are both accelerated depreciation methods (ACRS and [[MACRS]]).\n\n==Background==\nCompanies in many countries pay taxes on [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s: [[revenue]]s minus [[expense]]s. There are various types of expenses, including salaries paid to workers, cost of inputs, and [[amortization]] and [[depreciation]]. Profits for tax purposes will, in most countries, differ from [[accounting profit]]s or [[earnings]].\n\nUnder both [[financial accounting]] and [[tax accounting]], companies are not allowed to claim the entire cost of a [[capital asset]] (any asset which can be used for many years) as an expense immediately. They must [[amortize]] the cost of the asset over some period, usually an approximation of the useful life of the asset.  The depreciation basis is the cost incurred by the company in acquiring the asset.  The useful life of the asset is determined by looking at Section 168(e)(3) of the United States Tax Code, and is known as the class life of the property.  An example would be that a railroad track has a useful life of 7 years.  This is not the end of the analysis however, because then it becomes necessary to look at the applicable recovery period of the property.  The applicable recovery period determines the number of years over which the property should be depreciated.  Section 168(e)(1) provides a table for determining the applicable recovery period.  Following our 7 year railroad track, the table states that property with a useful life of more than 4 years but less than 10 years will be treated as 5 year property.  Finally, it is important to determine the applicable convention for depreciation.  Section 168(d)(4) of the U.S. Tax Code gives three different types: half year convention, the mid-month convention, and the midquarter convention.  Conventions determine how much of the depreciation deduction the taxpayer may take the first year.  This prevents taxpayers from claiming a full year's deduction when the asset has only been in service for part of the year.    \n\n\n\nGovernments generally provide opportunities to defer taxes where there are specific policy reasons to encourage an industry. For example, accelerated depreciation is used in some countries to encourage investment in [[renewable energy]].  Further, governments have increased accelerated depreciation methods in time of economic stress (in particular, the US government passed laws after 9\u201311 to further accelerate depreciation on capital assets).\n\n==Example== \n\nAs a simple example, a company buys a [[Electrical generator|generator]] that costs $1,000 that is expected to last for 10 years. Under the most simple form of depreciation, the company might allocate $100 of the cost of the generator to its expenses every year, until the $1000 capital expense has been \"used up.\" Under accelerated depreciation, the company may be allowed to allocate $200 of the cost of the generator for five years.\n\nIf the company has $200 in profits per year (before consideration of the cost of the generator or any effects of [[debt]] or other factors), and the tax rate is 20%:\n\na) Normal depreciation: the company claims $100 in depreciation every year and has a [[tax profit]] of $100; it must pay tax of $20 on the $100 gain. Over ten years, $200 in taxes are paid.\n\nb) Accelerated depreciation: the company claims $200 in depreciation for the first five years, and nothing for the last five years. For the first five years, it has no taxable profit and pays no gains tax. For the last five years, the company has a gain of $200, and pays $40 per year in tax, for a total of $200.\n\nTo compare these two (simplified) cases, the company pays $200 in taxes in both instances. In the second case, it has deferred taxes to a much later period. The deferral of taxes to a later period is favorable according to the [[time value of money]] principle.\n\n(This example has been simplified for a basic demonstration of how accelerated depreciation works.  It does not factor in an accurate class life, recovery period or account for convention.) \n\n== See also ==\n*[[Depreciation]]\n*[[MACRS]]\n*[[Diminished value]]\n*[[Accelerated Depreciation (Automotive)]]\n\n==References==\nSection 168(e)(3) United States Tax Code<br />\nSection 168(e)(1) United States Tax Code<br />\nSection 168(d)(4) United States Tax Code\n\n==External links==\n\n[[Category:Accounting terminology]]\n[[Category:Depreciation]]\n", "text_old": "{{Globalize|date=September 2011}}\n'''Accelerated depreciation''' refers to any one of several methods by which a company, for 'financial accounting' or [[tax]] purposes, [[depreciation|depreciates]] a [[fixed asset]] in such a way that the amount of depreciation taken each year is higher during the earlier years of an asset\u2019s life.

''Strider'' is a [[hack and slash]] [[Platform game|platformer]] set in a [[dystopian]] future with wide range of settings that affect gameplay. It marked the video game debut of [[Strider Hiryu|Hiryu]] after the character  was introduced in the 1988 [[manga]] ''Strider Hiryu''.\n\n[[Porting|Ports]] for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[IBM PC compatibles]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] were developed by [[Tiertex]] and published by [[U.S. Gold]] in 1989. The [[Strider (NES video game)|NES port]] is part of a three-way cooperation between Capcom and manga publisher [[Moto Kikaku]], which also includes a manga book.\n\n[[Sega]] released ''Strider'' for its own [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console in 1990 Of all home versions, the Genesis adaptation is considered the most successful, winning the 1990 Video Game of the Year and Best Graphics in a Video Game awards from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' and later included in the book ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]''.\n\n''Strider'''s gameplay is cited as a major influence on the video game franchises ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]'', ''[[Devil May Cry]]'', and ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]''. It became one of Capcom's early hits, praised for its innovative gameplay, diverse and unique music, and multilingual voice samples.\n\n==Gameplay== <!-- Please Note: Continues are allowed by default, but they can also be denied with a DIP switch setting.-->\n[[Image:Strider.png|thumb|left|The Kazakh SSR stage]]\n\nThe controls of ''Strider'' consist of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons for attacking and jumping. The player controls the protagonist [[Strider Hiryu]], whose main weapon is a [[tonfa]]-like plasma sword known as \"Cypher\". He can perform numerous acrobatic feats depending on the joystick/button combination used. Pressing the jump button while Hiryu is standing still will cause him to do a regular vertical jump, while pressing the jump button while pushing the joystick left or right will enable him to do a cartwheel jump. Hiryu can also slide under or through certain obstacles and enemies by first crouching down and then pressing the jump button. As well as his sliding move, both jumps can also be used to destroy weaker opponents. Hiryu is able to latch onto certain platforms, and climb across walls and ceilings using a metallic hook. While running down a sloped surface, Hiryu can gain enough momentum to allow him to do a longer cartwheel jump than usual.\n\nNumerous power-ups can be obtained from item boxes carried by certain enemies. These include an extension to Hiryu's attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the [[kanji]] used to write Hiryu's name: [[wiktionary:\u98db|\u98db]] and \u98db\u7adc), a max health extension (represented by the kanji [[wiktionary:\u7adc|\u7adc]], the second character in Hiryu's name), an [[extra life]], and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 15 seconds.<ref name=psmanualp17>{{cite video game|title=Strider 2|developer=Capcom|platform=PlayStation|level=Instruction manual, page 17}}</ref> Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as \"options\" that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two [[mushroom]]-like droids, a [[Saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed robo tiger]] and a robot [[hawk]], known individually as Options A, B and C respectively.<ref name=psmanualp18>{{cite video game|title=Strider 2|developer=Capcom|platform=PlayStation|level=Instruction manual, page 18}}</ref>\n\nThe game has five stages: the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]] (called \"[[St. Petersburg]]\" during the arcade game's attract sequence), the [[Siberia]]n Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship Balrog, the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian Jungle]], and the Grandmaster's lair itself, the Third Moon. Each of the stages is divided into a number of smaller sections, each with their own time limit and checkpoint location. The player has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with the health extensions). Hiryu will lose a life when either his health gauge is fully depleted, by moving him off the screen entirely (like falling into a bottomless pit) or when the game's timer reaches zero. It is [[Game Over]] when all of Hiryu's lives are lost, but the player can be given the opportunity to continue.\n\n==Plot== <!-- Please note: This page is for the original arcade game Strider.

Kouichi Yotsui, director of the coin-op ''Strider'' (who is credited as Isuke in the game), was chosen for his experience with the [[CP System]] hardware while working as a background designer on ''[[Ghouls 'n Ghosts]]''. The three projects were developed independently of each other.<ref name=Gameside>{{Cite journal|last1=Tane|first1=Kiyofume|last2=Gaijin Punch (translation)|title=The Father of Strider Who Made the Game World Explode: Kouichi Yotsui Discography|journal=Gameside|issue=16|date=February 2009|url=http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2313&type=translation&p=2|access-date=30 Dec 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222000306/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2313&type=translation&p=2|archive-date=2014-12-22|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe original arcade game soundtrack was composed entirely by female video game music composer Junko Tamiya, who was not credited for her work in the arcade version but was mentioned as part of the original arcade staff in some console adaptations. Early revisions of the arcade game were missing the unique music for the Aerial Battleship and Third Moon stages. In this version the music from the first stage of the game was repeated here instead.<ref name=\"Tamiya\"/>\n\n''Strider'' contains many different styles of themes that change dynamically throughout the game according to the stages and the situations on screen. These range from [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[art rock|progressive]] futuristic [[sci-fi]] action themes to [[baroque music|baroque]], [[indigenous music|tribal]] and [[classical music|classical]] music pieces. Elements from the soundtrack have also been used in other Capcom games where Hiryu has appeared. These include the ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series as well as other ''Strider'' related games.<ref name=\"Tamiya\"/>\n\n==Home versions==\nPorts of ''Strider'' for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[DOS]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] were published by [[U.S. Gold]] and developed by [[Tiertex]] in 1989. The U.S. Gold versions have the order of the third and fourth stages swapped (the order of the [[cut-scene]]s were kept the same, causing a continuity error), and the final battle with the Grandmaster missing (the last stages end with the battle against the giant robot gorilla Mecha Pong). As a result, the ending was changed to reveal that the events of the game were a simulation that the player was going through. All five versions featured downgraded graphics, less music and missing enemies compared to the arcade version. Additionally, the controls were modified so that the game would be compatible with one-button joystick controllers. Despite these changes, all of the U.S. Gold releases received high review scores by computer game magazines of the time. Later, in 1992, the assets of the Amiga versions were used for the conversion on the [[Sega Master System]], also made by Tiertex. A final fight with the Grandmaster was added in this version, but the ending credits continue to say that all was just a simulation.\n\n[[Sega]] produced their home version of ''Strider'' for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], which was released in Japan on September 29, 1990, with subsequent releases in North America and the [[PAL region]]. It was advertised as one of the first 8-Megabit cartridges for the system, and went on to be a bestseller.<ref>[https://archive.is/20140615174929/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue110/Pages/CVG11000078.jpg]</ref> <!-- Game of the year and best graphics status is mentioned in the Reception section --> This version was also re-released for the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on November 15, 2011 and in North America on February 16, 2012. The Genesis/Mega Drive version contains a different ending from the arcade game. This ending shows the destruction of the final stage as the game's protagonist makes his escape. This is then followed by the main credit sequence that sees Hiryu flying his glider in space and reminiscing about the various encounters he had during his mission as he heads back to earth. The ending theme was an edited combination of two separate pieces of music planned for the arcade game, but replaced with a repeat of the first level music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTxZ-uwcf04#t=2785 |title=Capcom Game Syndrome (Laserdisc) |publisher=YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-09}}</ref> Computer magazine [[ACE (magazine)|ACE]] considered the previous Amiga conversion to be \"as good as this one\".<ref name=\"ace\"/>\n\nCapcom separately produced a version for the [[Sharp X68000]] computer in 1991, releasing it exclusively in Japan. It is a very close reproduction of the arcade original, with minimal changes.\n\n[[NEC|NEC Avenue]] produced a [[PC Engine CD]] version of ''Strider Hiryu'', which was released exclusively in Japan on September 22, 1994 as a [[CD-ROM]]\u00b2 title which requires the Arcade Card expansion. It features an all-new desert stage that was not in the arcade version, as well as newly recorded cut-scenes, music and dialogue, with Japanese voice actor [[Kaneto Shiozawa]] as the voice of Hiryu and [[K\u014dji Totani]] as the Grand Master. The PC Engine CD version had a long development process, having been planned in various formats, including the [[SuperGrafx]] at one point.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lscmainframe.net/features/supergrafx/|title=The Rumored SuperGrafx Conversion|publisher=LSCM 4.0|accessdate=21 Dec 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723193203/http://www.lscmainframe.net/features/supergrafx/ |archivedate=July 23, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] version of ''Strider'' was first released by Capcom in 2000 as a second disc which came packaged with the PlayStation version of ''[[Strider 2]]''.

Its backgrounds were brilliantly designed and featured an array of exotic locations, while its sprite design was superb. There was a uniqueness to ''Strider'' art design that gave it a distinctive look back in 1989 and still makes it stand out brilliantly today. It's a mysterious mish-mash of different cultures that ensured it stood out from its arcade peers.\" Jones also praised the game's \"stunning animation\", gameplay, and controls, as well as its \"superbly atmospheric\" soundtrack.<ref name=ug>\"Ultimate Guide: Strider\" in ''Retro Gamer'' 121.</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n===NES game===\n{{Main|Strider (NES video game)}}\n\n[[Strider (NES video game)|''Strider'']] was released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] exclusively in North America a few months after the arcade version's release. This version was produced alongside the arcade game but follows the plot of [[Moto Kikaku]]'s tie-in manga. A [[Famicom]] version of the same game was planned for release in Japan, but never made it to the shelves.\n\n===Sequels===\n{{Main|Strider II|Strider 2}}\n\nUnder license from Capcom U.S.A., [[U.S. Gold]] and [[Tiertex]] produced a ''Strider'' sequel in Europe titled ''[[Strider II]]'' (released in North America as ''Journey From Darkness: Strider Returns'') for various computer platforms, as well as the [[Sega Genesis|Sega Genesis/Mega Drive]], [[Game Gear]], and [[Master System]] home consoles. This European-produced sequel was not released in Japan. Like the previous conversions of the original game, the quality of this one was very low.

''Strider'' is a [[hack and slash]] [[Platform game|platformer]] set in a [[dystopian]] future with wide range of settings that affect gameplay. It marked the video game debut of [[Strider Hiryu|Hiryu]] after the character  was introduced in the 1988 [[manga]] ''Strider Hiryu''.\n\n[[Porting|Ports]] for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[IBM PC compatibles]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] were developed by [[Tiertex]] and published by [[U.S. Gold]] in 1989. The [[Strider (NES video game)|NES port]] is part of a three-way cooperation between Capcom and manga publisher [[Moto Kikaku]], which also includes a manga book.\n\n[[Sega]] released ''Strider'' for its own [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console in 1990 Of all home versions, the Genesis adaptation is considered the most successful, winning the 1990 Video Game of the Year and Best Graphics in a Video Game awards from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' and later included in the book ''[[1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]''.\n\n''Strider'''s gameplay is cited as a major influence on the video game franchises ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]'', ''[[Devil May Cry]]'', and ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]''. It became one of Capcom's early big hits, praised for its innovative gameplay, diverse and unique music, and multilingual voice samples.\n\n==Gameplay== <!-- Please Note: Continues are allowed by default, but they can also be denied with a DIP switch setting.-->\n[[Image:Strider.png|thumb|left|The Kazakh SSR stage]]\n\nThe controls of ''Strider'' consist of an eight-way joystick and two action buttons for attacking and jumping. The player controls the protagonist [[Strider Hiryu]], whose main weapon is a [[tonfa]]-like plasma sword known as \"Cypher\". He can perform numerous acrobatic feats depending on the joystick/button combination used. Pressing the jump button while Hiryu is standing still will cause him to do a regular vertical jump, while pressing the jump button while pushing the joystick left or right will enable him to do a cartwheel jump. Hiryu can also slide under or through certain obstacles and enemies by first crouching down and then pressing the jump button. As well as his sliding move, both jumps can also be used to destroy weaker opponents. Hiryu is able to latch onto certain platforms, and climb across walls and ceilings using a metallic hook. While running down a sloped surface, Hiryu can gain enough momentum to allow him to do a longer cartwheel jump than usual.\n\nNumerous power-ups can be obtained from item boxes carried by certain enemies. These include an extension to Hiryu's attack range that lasts for one hundred slashes, two types of health aids (represented by the [[kanji]] used to write Hiryu's name: [[wiktionary:\u98db|\u98db]] and \u98db\u7adc), a max health extension (represented by the kanji [[wiktionary:\u7adc|\u7adc]], the second character in Hiryu's name), an [[extra life]], and a power-up that not only makes Hiryu invulnerable to attack but also increases his own attack abilities via shadow images of himself for 15 seconds.<ref name=psmanualp17>{{cite video game|title=Strider 2|developer=Capcom|platform=PlayStation|level=Instruction manual, page 17}}</ref> Hiryu can also summon robotic companions known collectively as \"options\" that help him fight enemies. These consist of up to two [[mushroom]]-like droids, a [[Saber-toothed cat|saber-toothed robo tiger]] and a robot [[hawk]], known individually as Options A, B and C respectively.<ref name=psmanualp18>{{cite video game|title=Strider 2|developer=Capcom|platform=PlayStation|level=Instruction manual, page 18}}</ref>\n\nThe game has five stages: the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]] (called \"[[St. Petersburg]]\" during the arcade game's attract sequence), the [[Siberia]]n Wilderness, the Aerial Battleship Balrog, the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonian Jungle]], and the Grandmaster's lair itself, the Third Moon. Each of the stages is divided into a number of smaller sections, each with their own time limit and checkpoint location. The player has a three-point health gauge (which can be increased to five points with the health extensions).

Kouichi Yotsui, director of the coin-op ''Strider'' (who is credited as Isuke in the game), was chosen for his experience with the [[CP System]] hardware while working as a background designer on ''[[Ghouls 'n Ghosts]]''. The three projects were developed independently of each other.<ref name=Gameside>{{Cite journal|last1=Tane|first1=Kiyofume|last2=Gaijin Punch (translation)|title=The Father of Strider Who Made the Game World Explode: Kouichi Yotsui Discography|journal=Gameside|issue=16|date=February 2009|url=http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2313&type=translation&p=2|access-date=30 Dec 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141222000306/http://www.gamengai.com/cmnt_inf.php?id=2313&type=translation&p=2|archive-date=2014-12-22|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe original arcade game soundtrack was composed entirely by female video game music composer Junko Tamiya, who was not credited for her work in the arcade version but was mentioned as part of the original arcade staff in some console adaptations. Early revisions of the arcade game were missing the unique music for the Aerial Battleship and Third Moon stages. In this version the music from the first stage of the game was repeated here instead.<ref name=\"Tamiya\"/>\n\n''Strider'' contains many different styles of themes that change dynamically throughout the game according to the stages and the situations on screen. These range from [[experimental music|experimental]] and [[art rock|progressive]] futuristic [[sci-fi]] action themes to [[baroque music|baroque]], [[indigenous music|tribal]] and [[classical music|classical]] music pieces. Elements from the soundtrack have also been used in other Capcom games where Hiryu has appeared. These include the ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series as well as other ''Strider'' related games.<ref name=\"Tamiya\"/>\n\n==Home versions==\nPorts of ''Strider'' for the [[Amiga]], [[Amstrad CPC]], [[Atari ST]], [[Commodore 64]], [[DOS]], and [[ZX Spectrum]] were published by [[U.S. Gold]] and developed by [[Tiertex]] in 1989. The U.S. Gold versions have the order of the third and fourth stages swapped (the order of the [[cut-scene]]s were kept the same, causing a continuity error), and the final battle with the Grandmaster missing (the last stages end with the battle against the giant robot gorilla Mecha Pong). As a result, the ending was changed to reveal that the events of the game were a simulation that the player was going through. All five versions featured downgraded graphics, less music and missing enemies compared to the arcade version. Additionally, the controls were modified so that the game would be compatible with one-button joystick controllers. Despite these changes, all of the U.S. Gold releases received high review scores by computer game magazines of the time. Later, in 1992, the assets of the Amiga versions were used for the conversion on the [[Sega Master System]], also made by Tiertex. A final fight with the Grandmaster was added in this version, but the ending credits continue to say that all was just a simulation.\n\n[[Sega]] produced their home version of ''Strider'' for the [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]], which was released in Japan on September 29, 1990, with subsequent releases in North America and the [[PAL region]]. It was advertised as one of the first 8-Megabit cartridges for the system, and went on to be a bestseller.<ref>[https://archive.is/20140615174929/http://www.worldofspectrum.org/showmag.cgi?mag=C+VG/Issue110/Pages/CVG11000078.jpg]</ref> <!-- Game of the year and best graphics status is mentioned in the Reception section --> This version was also re-released for the [[Wii]] [[Virtual Console]] in Japan on November 15, 2011 and in North America on February 16, 2012. The Genesis/Mega Drive version contains a different ending from the arcade game. This ending shows the destruction of the final stage as the game's protagonist makes his escape. This is then followed by the main credit sequence that sees Hiryu flying his glider in space and reminiscing about the various encounters he had during his mission as he heads back to earth. The ending theme was an edited combination of two separate pieces of music planned for the arcade game, but replaced with a repeat of the first level music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTxZ-uwcf04#t=2785 |title=Capcom Game Syndrome (Laserdisc) |publisher=YouTube.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-09}}</ref> Computer magazine [[ACE (magazine)|ACE]] considered the previous Amiga conversion to be \"as good as this one\".<ref name=\"ace\"/>\n\nCapcom separately produced a version for the [[Sharp X68000]] computer in 1991, releasing it exclusively in Japan. It is a very close reproduction of the arcade original, with minimal changes.\n\n[[NEC|NEC Avenue]] produced a [[PC Engine CD]] version of ''Strider Hiryu'', which was released exclusively in Japan on September 22, 1994 as a [[CD-ROM]]\u00b2 title which requires the Arcade Card expansion. It features an all-new desert stage that was not in the arcade version, as well as newly recorded cut-scenes, music and dialogue, with Japanese voice actor [[Kaneto Shiozawa]] as the voice of Hiryu and [[K\u014dji Totani]] as the Grand Master.

Middle Francia was allocated to emperor [[Lothair I]], the eldest son and successor of emperor [[Louis the Pious]]. His realm contained the imperial cities of [[Aachen]], the residence of Charlemagne, as well as [[Pavia]] but lacked any geographic or ethnic cohesion, which prevented it from surviving and forming a nucleus of a larger state, as was the case with [[West Francia]] and [[East Francia]].\n\nMiddle Francia was situated between the realms of [[East Francia|East]] and [[West Francia]], and comprised the Frankish territory between the rivers [[Rhine]] and [[Scheldt]], the [[Frisia]]n coast of the [[North Sea]], the former [[Kingdom of Burgundy]] (except for a western portion, later known as [[Duchy of Burgundy|''Bourgogne'']]) and [[Lower Burgundy|Provence]], as well as parts of northern Italy. Following the 855 partition, Middle Francia became only a geographic term and the bulk of its territory was reorganized as [[Lotharingia]], named after Lothair I's [[Lothair II|namesake son]].\n\n==Partition of 855==\nIn 855, on his deathbed at [[Pr\u00fcm Abbey]], Emperor Lothair I with the [[Treaty of Pr\u00fcm]] divided Middle Francia among his three sons. The lands in northern Italy, which extended as far south as Rome and Spoleto, were left to the eldest son [[Louis II of Italy|Louis II the Younger]], crowned co-Emperor in 850 and sole Emperor from 855. This eventually became the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Kingdom of Italy]]. Most of the lands north of the [[Alps]], comprising the [[Low Countries]], the western [[Rhineland]], the lands today on the border between [[France]] and [[Germany]], and what is now western [[Switzerland]], passed to [[Lothair II]] and were called [[Lotharingia]], after its ruler. [[Charles of Provence|Charles]] received the [[Kingdom of Burgundy]] ([[Upper Burgundy]] and [[Lower Burgundy]]) and [[Provence]], which became the [[Kingdom of Arles]], after Charles' capital.\n\n==Later partitions==\n[[File:843-870 Europe.jpg|thumb|left|Partitions of 843 and 870]]\nCharles died early and without sons in 863. According to Frankish custom, his brothers Louis II and Lothair II divided his realm. Lothair II received the western [[Lower Burgundy|Lower Burgundian]] parts (bishoprics of [[Lyonnais|Lyon]], [[Viennois|Vienne]], [[Vivarais]] and [[Uz\u00e8s]]) which were bordering his western [[Upper Burgundy]] (remnants of his original Burgundian possessions) which were incorporated into Lotharingia; while Louis II received the [[Kingdom of Provence]].\n\nWhen Lothair II died in 869, his only son [[Hugh, Duke of Alsace|Hugh]] by his mistress [[Waldrada of Lotharingia|Waldrada]] was declared illegitimate, so his only legal heir was his brother, Louis II. If Louis II had inherited Lotharingia, Middle Francia would have been reunited. However, as Louis II was at that time campaigning against the [[Emirate of Bari]], Lotharingia was partitioned between his uncles [[Charles the Bald]] and [[Louis the German]] by the [[Treaty of Meerssen]] in 870. Louis the German took [[Upper Burgundy]], territory north of the [[Jura Mountains|Jura mountains]] (''Bourgogne Transjurane''), while the rest went to Charles the Bald.\n\nIn 875 the last of Lothair I's children Louis II died without sons and named as his successor in Italy his cousin [[Carloman of Bavaria]], eldest son of Louis the German. However, [[Pope John VIII]], dealing with the constant threat of raiders from the [[Emirate of Sicily]], sided with Charles the Bald.{{sfn|Engreen|1945|p=325}} After much confusion and conflict, Charles the Bald took Louis' realm in Italy. Carloman was crowned King of Bavaria in 876 and invaded Italy in 877 to claim the Kingdom of Italy, but on his death in 880 also without any legitimate heirs, his kingdom went to his younger brother, King [[Charles the Fat]]. Charles was crowned Emperor by Pope John VIII in 881 and thus he reunited the entire Carolingian Empire in 884, although it lasted only until Charles' overthrow in 887.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* John M.

However, despite assurances from the ARL that all players were considered, it came as no surprise when only ARL loyal players made the Kangaroos World Cup squad. As one unnamed ARL official allegedly said, the court decision only forced the ARL to consider Super League players, they were not forced select them. As the list of players considered for the squad was never made public by the ARL it remains unknown how many, if any, SL players were actually considered for World Cup selection with rumours persisting that no SL player was actually given any consideration.\n\n==Venues==\nThe games were played at various venues in [[England]] and [[Wales]].\n\n[[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in [[London]] was the host stadium for the opening ceremony and match featuring hosts England and defending champions Australia.

Press, ''et al.'', ''Numerical Recipes in C'', (1987) Cambridge University Press, {{isbn|0-521-43108-5}} (See section 5.1).</ref>\n\n==Conformal mappings==\nA series\n\n:<math>S=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n</math>\n\ncan be written as f(1), where the function f(z) is defined as\n\n:<math>f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^{n}</math>\n\nThe function f(z) can have singularities in the complex plane (branch point singularities, poles or essential singularities), which limit the radius of convergence of the series. If the point z = 1 is close to or on the boundary of the disk of convergence, the series for S will converge very slowly. One can then improve the convergence of the series by means of a conformal mapping that moves the singularities such that the point that is mapped to z = 1, ends up deeper in the new disk of convergence.\n\nThe conformal transform <math>z = \\Phi(w)</math> needs to be chosen such that <math>\\Phi(0)=0</math>, and one usually chooses a function that has a finite derivative at w = 0. One can assume that <math>\\Phi(1)=1</math> without loss of generality, as one can always rescale w to redefine <math>\\Phi</math>. We then consider the function\n\n:<math>g(w)= f\\left(\\Phi(w)\\right)</math>\n\nSince <math>\\Phi(1)=1</math>, we have f(1) = g(1). We can obtain the series expansion of g(w) by putting <math>z=\\Phi(w)</math> in the series expansion of f(z) because <math>\\Phi(0)=0</math>; the first n terms of the series expansion for f(z) will yield the first n terms of the series expansion for g(w) if <math>\\Phi'(0)\\neq 0</math>. Putting w = 1 in that series expansion will thus yield a series such that if it converges, it will converge to the same value as the original series.\n\n==Non-linear sequence transformations==\n\nExamples of such nonlinear sequence transformations are [[Pad\u00e9 approximant]]s, the [[Shanks transformation]], and [[Levin-type sequence transformation]]s.\n\nEspecially nonlinear sequence transformations often provide  powerful numerical methods for the [[summation]] of [[divergent series]] or [[asymptotic series]] that arise for instance in [[perturbation theory]], and may be used as  highly effective [[extrapolation method]]s.\n\n===Aitken method===\n{{main|Aitken's delta-squared process}}\nA simple nonlinear sequence transformation is the Aitken extrapolation or delta-squared method,\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{A} : S \\to S'=\\mathbb{A}(S) = {(s'_n)}_{n\\in\\N}</math>\n\ndefined by\n\n:<math>s'_n = s_{n+2} - \\frac{(s_{n+2}-s_{n+1})^2}{s_{n+2}-2s_{n+1}+s_n}.</math>\n\nThis transformation is commonly used to improve the [[rate of convergence]] of a slowly converging sequence; heuristically, it eliminates the largest part of the [[absolute error]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Shanks transformation]]\n* [[Minimum polynomial extrapolation]]\n* [[Van Wijngaarden transformation]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n* C.

Press, ''et al.'', ''Numerical Recipes in C'', (1987) Cambridge University Press, {{isbn|0-521-43108-5}} (See section 5.1).</ref>\n\n==Conformal mappings==\nA series\n\n:<math>S=\\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n</math>\n\ncan be written as f(1), where the function f(z) is defined as\n\n:<math>f(z) = \\sum_{n=0}^{\\infty} a_n z^{n}</math>\n\nThe function f(z) can have singularities in the complex plane (branch point singularities, poles or essential singularities), which limit the radius of convergence of the series. If the point z = 1 is close to or on the boundary of the disk of convergence, the series for S will converge very slowly. One can then improve the convergence of the series by means of a conformal mapping that moves the singularities such that the point that is mapped to z = 1, ends up deeper in the new disk of convergence.\n\nThe conformal transform <math>z = \\Phi(w)</math> needs to be chosen such that <math>\\Phi(0)=0</math>, and one usually chooses a function that has a finite derivative at w = 0. One can assume that <math>\\Phi(1)=1</math> without loss of generality, as one can always rescale w to redefine <math>\\Phi</math>. We then consider the function\n\n:<math>g(w)= f\\left(\\Phi(w)\\right)</math>\n\nSince <math>\\Phi(1)=1</math>, we have f(1) = g(1). We can obtain the series expansion of g(w) by putting <math>z=\\Phi(w)</math> in the series expansion of f(z) because <math>\\Phi(0)=0</math>; the first n terms of the series expansion for f(z) will yield the first n terms of the series expansion for g(w) if <math>\\Phi'(0)\\neq 0</math>. Putting w = 1 in that series expansion will thus yield a series such that if it converges, it will converge to the same value as the original series.\n\n==Non-linear sequence transformations==\n\nExamples of such nonlinear sequence transformations are [[Pad\u00e9 approximant]]s, the [[Shanks transformation]], and [[Levin-type sequence transformation]]s.\n\nEspecially nonlinear sequence transformations often provide  powerful numerical methods for the [[summation]] of [[divergent series]] or [[asymptotic series]] that arise for instance in [[perturbation theory]], and may be used as  highly effective [[extrapolation method]]s.\n\n===Aitken method===\n{{main|Aitken's delta-squared process}}\nA simple nonlinear sequence transformation is the Aitken extrapolation or delta-squared method,\n\n:<math>\\mathbb{A} : S \\to S'=\\mathbb{A}(S) = {(s'_n)}_{n\\in\\N}</math>\n\ndefined by\n\n:<math>s'_n = s_{n+2} - \\frac{(s_{n+2}-s_{n+1})^2}{s_{n+2}-2s_{n+1}+s_n}.</math>\n\nThis transformation is commonly used to improve the [[rate of convergence]] of a slowly converging sequence; heuristically, it eliminates the largest part of the [[absolute error]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Shanks transformation]]\n* [[Minimum polynomial extrapolation]]\n* [[Van Wijngaarden transformation]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n* C.

But Indian tribes resisted the encroachment of settlers in their territories, setting off decades of violence. The federal government gradually pushed the tribes to more isolated areas, offering U.S. citizenship, but few opportunities, to those who agreed to accept allotments of land on reservations.\n\n'''1890 [[Stop sign]]'''\n\nA stop sign is a traffic sign, usually erected at road junctions such as a four-way intersection, that instructs drivers to stop and then to proceed only if the way ahead is clear. The idea of placing stop signs at road junctions was first conceived in 1890 when [[William Phelps Eno]] of Saugatuck, Connecticut proposed and devised the first set of traffic laws in an article published in ''Rider and Driver''. However, the first use of stop signs did not appear until 1915 when officials in Detroit, Michigan installed a stop sign with black letters on a white background. Throughout the years and with many alterations made to the stop sign, the current version with white block-lettering on a red background that is used in the United States as well as emulated in many other countries around the world today, did not come into use until the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted the design in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy Birthday Stop Sign!|publisher=The FatDUX Group ApS|url=http://www.fatdux.com/resources/articles/happy-birthday-stop-sign/|access-date=2010-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623044902/http://www.fatdux.com/resources/articles/happy-birthday-stop-sign/|archive-date=2010-06-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n'''1890 [[Tabulating machine]]'''\n\nThe tabulating machine is an electrical device designed to assist in summarizing information and, later, accounting. The results of a tabulation are electrically coupled with a sorter while displayed on clock-like dials. The concept of automated data processing had been born. In 1890, [[Herman Hollerith]] invented the mechanical tabulating machine, a design used during the 1890 Census which stored and processed demographic and statistical information on punched cards.<ref>{{cite web|title=Herman Hollerith|publisher=Columbia University|url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/hollerith.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about Herman Hollerith inventor of the punch card tabulating machine in 1890|publisher=The Great Idea Finder|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventors/hollerith.htm}}</ref>\n\n'''1890 [[Shredded wheat]]'''\n* Shredded wheat is a type of breakfast cereal made from whole [[wheat]]. Shredded wheat also comes in a ''frosted'' variety, which has one side coated with [[sugar]] and usually [[gelatin]].

Invented by [[Stephen Moulton Babcock]] in 1890, the test was developed to prevent dishonest farmers who could, until the 1890s, water down their milk or remove some cream before selling it to the factories because milk was paid by volume.<ref>{{cite web|title=Stephen Moulton Babcock|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/47410/Stephen-Moulton-Babcock}}</ref>\n\n'''1890 [[Smoke detector]]'''\n* A smoke detector is a device that detects smoke and issues a signal. Most smoke detectors work either by optical detection or by physical process, but some of them use both detection methods to increase sensitivity to smoke. Smoke detectors are usually powered by battery while some are connected directly to power mains, often having a battery as a power supply backup in case the mains power fails. The first automatic electric fire alarm was co-invented in 1890 by [[Francis Robbins Upton]] and Fernando J. Dibble. Upton and Dibble were issued U.S. patent #436,961. Upton was an associate of [[Thomas Alva Edison]], although there is no evidence that Edison contributed to this invention.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fire Safety Tips = Smoke Detectors|publisher=Center Pigeon Volunteer Fire Department, Inc.|url=http://centerpigeonfire.org/firesafetytips-smokedetectors.htm}}</ref>\n   1891 [[Incandescent Lamp]]\nOne of the most dramatic improvements occurred in artificial lighting.

The fork has 3 or 4 tines. The 3 tine fork has a larger, flattened and beveled tine on the side while the 4 tine fork has the 1st and 2nd tine connected or bridged together and beveled. On July 7, 1891, Anna M. Mangin of Queens, a borough of New York City, filed the first patent for the pastry fork. U.S. patent #470,005 was later issued on March 1, 1892.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pastry-Fork|publisher=Google Patents Search|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=n5huAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=May 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\n'''1891 [[Schrader valve]]'''\n\nA Schrader valve consists of a hollow cylindrical metal tube, typically brass, with the exterior end threaded. The interior end takes a variety of forms depending on its application. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is flush with the end of the valve body. Generally, all Schrader valves are used on tires. They have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic tires. Also, pressure valves can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires. In 1891, George Schrader, the son of German-American immigrant [[August Schrader]], invented the Schrader valve. A patent was issued on April 11, 1893.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Schrader Valve|publisher=Schrader International|url=http://www.schrader-bridgeport.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=59&Itemid=125|access-date=2010-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830011201/http://www.schrader-bridgeport.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=59&Itemid=125|archive-date=2010-08-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n'''1892 [[Bottle cap]]'''\n* Bottle caps, or closures, are used to seal the openings of bottles of many types. They can be small circular pieces of metal, usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. Flip-Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The [[crown cork]], the first form of a bottle cap, possessed flanges bent over a sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside. It was invented and patented in 1892 by [[William Painter (inventor)|William Painter]] of Baltimore, Maryland.<ref>{{cite news|title=Inventor Profile|publisher=National Inventors Hall of Fame|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/292.html|accessdate=November 11, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125024122/http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/292.html|archive-date=November 25, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Crown History|publisher=Crown Holdings, Inc.|url=http://www.crowncork.com/about/about_history.php|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}</ref>\n\n'''1892 [[Dimmer]]'''\n* Dimmers are devices used to vary the brightness of a light. By decreasing or increasing the RMS voltage and hence the mean power to the lamp it is possible to vary the intensity of the light output. Although variable-voltage devices are used for various purposes, a dimmer is specifically those devices intended to control lighting. Dimmers are popularly used in venues such as movie theatres, stages, dining rooms, restaurants, and auditoriums where the need or absence of light during activities requires constant change. The dimmer was invented in 1892 by [[Granville Woods]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dimmer Switch|publisher=Lighting Unlimited Company|url=http://www.dimmers.net/dimmer_switch.htm}}</ref>\n\n'''1892 [[Bicycle seat|Bicycle seat (padded)]]'''\n* A bicycle seat, unlike a [[bicycle saddle]], is designed to support the rider's buttocks and back, usually in a semi-reclined position.

The entire wing structure twists slightly in a helical motion in the desired direction. The concept of wing warping is attributed to [[Wilbur Wright]] who in 1899, came up with the idea and with the conclusion that the roll of an aircraft could be controlled by the motion of that aircraft's wings. Exemplified by the twisting of a long, narrow box, the Wright brothers incorporated wing warping on their [[Wright Glider#1899 kite|1899 glider]] that used ropes to pull on the wings. Later on, the young French engineer [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] replaced wing warping in 1904 with the [[aileron]] on a copy he made of a 19th-century Wright glider.

The pins are correspondingly shorter and lighter than their ten-pin equivalents. Hence, when the pins are knocked down, they resemble a \"flock of flying ducks\". While the rules remained almost identical to those of the Ten-pin game, one rule change was made: A bowler is allowed to use three bowls on each turn. Strikes would still be strikes and spares still spares, but when all pins were knocked down on the third ball, it counts as a score of ten. During the summer of 1900, some bowlers at Diamond Alleys in Baltimore, Maryland thought it might be interesting to resize the pins to match the 6-inch ball.

Periscopes allow a submarine, submerged at a shallow depth, to search for targets and threats in the surrounding sea and air. When not in use, the periscope is retracted into the hull. A sub commander in tactical conditions must exercise discretion when using his periscope, since it creates an observable wake and may be detectable to radar, giving away the sub's position. The invention of the collapsible periscope for use in submarine warfare is credited to [[Simon Lake]] in 1902, who called his device the omniscope or skalomniscope.

In the condenser microphone, one of these plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing the distance between the two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external [[phantom power]].

Various parts of the artwork layers are left transparent, to allow other layers to be seen behind them. The movements are calculated and photographed frame-by-frame, with the result being an illusion of depth by having several layers of artwork moving at different speeds. The further away from the camera, the slower the speed. The multiplane effect is sometimes referred to as a parallax process. As a former director and animator of Walt Disney Studios, [[Ub Iwerks]] in 1933 invented the multiplane camera using four layers of flat artwork before a horizontal camera.<ref>{{cite web|title=Episode 3: Ub Iwerks' ComiColor|publisher=animationstation's Podcast|url=http://www.animationstation.info/index.php?post_id=75948}}</ref>\n\n'''1933 [[Frequency modulation]]'''\n* In telecommunications, frequency modulation (FM) conveys information over a carrier wave by varying its frequency. While working in the basement laboratory of Columbia's Philosophy Hall, [[Edwin Armstrong]] invented wide-band frequency modulation radio in 1933. Rather than varying the amplitude of a radio wave to create sound, Armstrong's method varied the frequency of the wave instead. FM radio broadcasts delivered a much clearer sound, free of static, than the [[AM radio]] dominant at the time.

However, there is no need to stop if his way is clear. A driver who stops has yielded his right of way to another. The yield sign, but not the yield traffic rule itself, was invented in 1939 by Tulsa police officer [[Clinton Riggs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=In a sign of the times, inventor refuses to yield|publisher=The Pittsburgh Press|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19890830&id=Qkg0AAAAIBAJ&sjid=w2MEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2072,9591990}}</ref>\n\n'''1939 [[VU meter]]'''\n\nA VU meter is often included in analog circuit, audio equipment to display a signal level in Volume Units. It is intentionally a \"slow\" measurement, averaging out peaks and troughs of short duration to reflect the perceived loudness of the material. It was originally invented in 1939 by the combined effort of [[Bell Labs]] and broadcasters CBS and NBC for measuring and standardizing the levels of telephone lines. The instrument used to measure VU is called the volume indicator (VI) instrument. Most users ignore this and call it a VU meter.\n\n'''1939 [[Starting gate]]'''\n* A starting gate, also known as starting stalls, is a machine used in the sports of [[Thoroughbred horse racing|thoroughbred horse]] and [[dog racing]] to ensure a fair start in a race.

A twist tie is used by wrapping it around the item to be fastened, then twisting the ends together. The original twist tie was invented by the California-based packaging company T and T Industries, Inc. It was patented in 1939 and marketed as the Twist-Ems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Company Profile|publisher=Twist Ems|url=http://www.twistems.com/pages/profile.html}}</ref>\n\n'''1939 [[Automated teller machine]]'''\n[[File:Atm os2warp.jpg|180px|left|thumb| A Suncorp Metway ATM]]\nAn automated teller machine (ATM) is a computerized telecommunications device that provides the clients of a financial institution with access to financial transactions in a public space without the need for a cashier, human clerk or bank teller. ATMs are known by various other names including automatic banking machine, cash machine, and various regional variants derived from trademarks on ATM systems held by particular banks. Financial transcationssuch as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers of accounts may be conducted at ATM's by inserting an [[ATM card]]. In 1939, Armenian-American inventor [[Luther George Simjian]] initially came up with the idea of creating a hole-in-the-wall machine that would allow customers to make financial transactions. The idea was met with a great deal of skepticism after Citicorp tested it. In later years and after Simjian filed 20 patents related to the device, the idea and the gradual usage of ATM's became more widespread around the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Luther Simjian|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/simjian.html}}</ref>\n\n'''1939 [[Vocoder]]'''\n\nA vocoder, a portmanteau of the words voice and encoder, is an analysis and synthesis system, mostly used for speech. In the encoder, the input is passed through a multiband filter, each band is passed through an envelope follower, and the control signals from the envelope followers are communicated to the decoder. The decoder applies these control signals to corresponding filters in the (re)synthesizer. Research physicist [[Homer Dudley]] invented the Vocoder at Bell Labs in 1939 which served the purpose of improving the voice-carrying capabilities of his employer's telephone lines.<ref>{{cite web|title=SYNTH SECRETS Part 15: An Introduction To ESPS And Vocoders|publisher=SOS Publications Group|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jul00/articles/synthsec.htm}}</ref>\n\n'''1940 [[Fluxgate magnetometer]]'''\n* A fluxgate magnetometer measures the direction and magnitude of magnetic fields.

Developed in 1941 by [[Lyle D. Goodhue]] and William N. Sullivan and patented in 1943.\n  \n'''1941 [[Deodorant]]'''\n* Deodorants are substances applied to the body to reduce body odor caused by the bacterial breakdown of perspiration. [[Jules Montenier]] holds a number of patents. Arguably, his January 28, 1941 patent for Astringent Preparation is his most famous which dealt with solving the problem of the excessive acidity of aluminum chloride, then and now the best working antiperspirant, by adding a soluble nitrile or a similar compound. This innovation found its way into \"Stopette\" deodorant spray, which ''Time'' Magazine called \"the best-selling deodorant of the early 1950s\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Poof!

To be called acrylic in the United States, the polymer must contain at least 85% acrylonitrile monomer. Typical comonomers are vinyl acetate or methyl acrylate. The Dupont Corporation invented the first acrylic fibers in 1941 and trademarked them under the name \"Orlon\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Orlon : 1941|publisher=DuPont|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Heritage/en_US/1941_dupont/1941_overview.html}}</ref>\n\n'''1941 [[Solid body guitar|Electric guitar (solid body)]]'''\n* A solid body electric guitar, made up of hardwood with a lacquer coating, is an [[electric guitar]] that has no hollow internal cavity to accommodate vibration. There are no sound holes such as those used to amplify string vibrations in acoustic guitars. The sound that is audible in music featuring electric guitars is produced by pickups on the guitar that convert the string vibrations into an electrical signal, usually fed into an [[amplifier]] or a [[Computer speaker|speaker]]. The solid body guitar was invented in 1941 by American recording artist [[Les Paul]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Les Paul|publisher=Invent Now|url=http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/225.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610005558/http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/225.html|archivedate=2011-06-10}}</ref>\n\n'''1942 [[Bazooka]]'''\n[[File:Soldier with Bazooka M1.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A soldier holding an M1 bazooka]]\nA bazooka is a shoulder-fired, man-portable recoilless rocket anti-tank weapon that features a solid rocket motor for propulsion, allowing for [[high explosive]] (HE) and [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads]] to be delivered against [[armored vehicles]], machine gun nests, and fortified bunkers at ranges beyond that of a standard thrown [[grenade]] or mine.

In 1943, Panayottis John Eliomarkakis of Philiadelphia filed U.S. patent #2,434,551 which was issued on January 13, 1948.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnetic Fuze|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=bp9HAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n'''1943 Modern Coal Burning Steam Locomotive'''\n\nThis invention was only primarily used with steam locomotives that had booster valves or superchargers to heat the fire even hotter to produce extra power. The coal used was semi-bituminous and bituminous coal only inside the steam locomotives. Sadly, this invention lasted until 1960 when Diesel's fully replaced American railroads.\n\n'''1943 [[Slinky]]'''\n\nA Slinky or \"Lazy Spring\" is a toy consisting of a helical spring that stretches and can bounce up and down. It can perform a number of tricks, including traveling down a flight of steps end-over-end as it stretches and re-forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum. The Slinky was invented in 1943 by American engineer [[Richard T. James]] while working in his home laboratory to invent a set of springs that could be used to support sensitive instruments on board ships and stabilize them even in rough seas. When he once accidentally knocked one of his springs off a shelf, James saw that, rather than flopping in a heap onto the floor, the spring \"stepped\" in a series of arcs from the shelf, to a stack of books, to a tabletop, to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. In 1945, the James first exhibited his new toy at the [[Gimbels]], a department store located in Philadelphia. He sold 400 Slinkys in 90 minutes which was the start of a sensation that continues to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Slinky|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/slinky.html}}</ref>\n\n''' 1945 [[Microwave oven]]'''\n[[File:Microwave.750pix.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A microwave oven with a turn table located inside]]\nA microwave oven cooks or heats food by dielectric heating. Cooking food with microwaves was discovered by [[Percy Spencer]] on October 8, 1945, while building magnetrons for radar sets at Raytheon. Spencer was working on an active radar set when he noticed a strange sensation, and saw that a peanut candy bar he had in his pocket started to melt. Although he was not the first to notice this phenomenon, as the holder of 120 patents, Spencer was no stranger to discovery and experiment, and realized what was happening. The radar had melted his candy bar with microwaves. The first food to be deliberately cooked with microwaves was popcorn, and the second was an egg.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Invented Microwaves?|publisher= J.

The driver sets the speed and the system will take over the throttle of the car to maintain the same speed. Cruise control was invented in 1945 by a blind inventor and mechanical engineer named [[Ralph Teetor]]. His idea was born out of the frustration of riding in a car driven by his lawyer, who kept speeding up and slowing down as he talked. The first car with Teetor's system was the Chrysler Imperial in 1958. This system calculated ground speed based on driveshaft rotations and used a solenoid to vary throttle position as needed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ralph Teetor: Inventor of Cruise Control|publisher=Dennis Horvath|url=http://www.cruise-in.com/resource/cismar08.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104031820/http://www.cruise-in.com/resource/cismar08.htm|archivedate=2005-11-04}}</ref>\n\n'''1945 [[Block heater]]'''\n* A block heater warms the engine of an [[automobile]] in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric heating element connected through a [[power cord]] often routed through the vehicle's [[grille]]. The block heater may replace one of the engine's [[core plug]]s, or may be installed in line with one of the [[radiator]] or heater hoses. The block heater, first known as a head bolt heater, was invented in 1945 by [[Andrew Freeman (inventor)|Andrew Freeman]] in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's water jacket and the oil film between cylinder heads and pistons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Your car starts?

But Indian tribes resisted the encroachment of settlers in their territories, setting off decades of violence. The federal government gradually pushed the tribes to more isolated areas, offering U.S. citizenship, but few opportunities, to those who agreed to accept allotments of land on reservations.\n\n'''1890 [[Stop sign]]'''\n\nA stop sign is a traffic sign, usually erected at road junctions such as a four-way intersection, that instructs drivers to stop and then to proceed only if the way ahead is clear. The idea of placing stop signs at road junctions was first conceived in 1890 when [[William Phelps Eno]] of Saugatuck, Connecticut proposed and devised the first set of traffic laws in an article published in ''Rider and Driver''. However, the first use of stop signs did not appear until 1915 when officials in Detroit, Michigan installed a stop sign with black letters on a white background. Throughout the years and with many alterations made to the stop sign, the current version with white block-lettering on a red background that is used in the United States as well as emulated in many other countries around the world today, did not come into use until the Joint Committee on Uniform Traffic Control Devices adopted the design in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy Birthday Stop Sign!|publisher=The FatDUX Group ApS|url=http://www.fatdux.com/resources/articles/happy-birthday-stop-sign/|access-date=2010-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623044902/http://www.fatdux.com/resources/articles/happy-birthday-stop-sign/|archive-date=2010-06-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n'''1890 [[Tabulating machine]]'''\n\nThe tabulating machine is an electrical device designed to assist in summarizing information and, later, accounting. The results of a tabulation are electrically coupled with a sorter while displayed on clock-like dials. The concept of automated data processing had been born.

Most smoke detectors work either by optical detection or by physical process, but some of them use both detection methods to increase sensitivity to smoke. Smoke detectors are usually powered by battery while some are connected directly to power mains, often having a battery as a power supply backup in case the mains power fails. The first automatic electric fire alarm was co-invented in 1890 by [[Francis Robbins Upton]] and Fernando J. Dibble. Upton and Dibble were issued U.S. patent #436,961. Upton was an associate of [[Thomas Alva Edison]], although there is no evidence that Edison contributed to this invention.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fire Safety Tips = Smoke Detectors|publisher=Center Pigeon Volunteer Fire Department, Inc.|url=http://centerpigeonfire.org/firesafetytips-smokedetectors.htm}}</ref>\n   1891 [[Incandescent Lamp]]\nOne of the most dramatic improvements occurred in artificial lighting.

The interior end takes a variety of forms depending on its application. In the center of the exterior end is a metal pin pointing along the axis of the tube; the pin's end is flush with the end of the valve body. Generally, all Schrader valves are used on tires. They have threads and bodies of a single standard size at the exterior end, so caps and tools generally are universal for the valves on all automobile and bicycle pneumatic tires. Also, pressure valves can be used on Schrader valves in place of caps in order to measure the pressure of pneumatic tires. In 1891, George Schrader, the son of German-American immigrant [[August Schrader]], invented the Schrader valve. A patent was issued on April 11, 1893.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Schrader Valve|publisher=Schrader International|url=http://www.schrader-bridgeport.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=59&Itemid=125|access-date=2010-09-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830011201/http://www.schrader-bridgeport.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=59&Itemid=125|archive-date=2010-08-30|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n'''1892 [[Bottle cap]]'''\n* Bottle caps, or closures, are used to seal the openings of bottles of many types. They can be small circular pieces of metal, usually steel, with plastic backings, and for plastic bottles a plastic cap is used instead. Caps can also be plastic, sometimes with a pour spout. Flip-Top caps like Flapper closures provide controlled dispensing of dry products. The [[crown cork]], the first form of a bottle cap, possessed flanges bent over a sealed bottle to compress the liquid inside.

By decreasing or increasing the RMS voltage and hence the mean power to the lamp it is possible to vary the intensity of the light output. Although variable-voltage devices are used for various purposes, a dimmer is specifically those devices intended to control lighting. Dimmers are popularly used in venues such as movie theatres, stages, dining rooms, restaurants, and auditoriums where the need or absence of light during activities requires constant change.

The entire wing structure twists slightly in a helical motion in the desired direction. The concept of wing warping is attributed to [[Wilbur Wright]] who in 1899, came up with the idea and with the conclusion that the roll of an aircraft could be controlled by the motion of that aircraft's wings. Exemplified by the twisting of a long, narrow box, the Wright brothers incorporated wing warping on their [[Wright Glider#1899 kite|1899 glider]] that used ropes to pull on the wings. Later on, the young French engineer [[Robert Esnault-Pelterie]] replaced wing warping in 1904 with the [[aileron]] on a copy he made of a 19th-century Wright glider. However, it was [[Henry Farman]], a French aviator, who was the first to use the aileron as an integral part of the wing structure in place of wing warping in 1908.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wing Warping|publisher=U.S. Centennial of Flight Commission|url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Dictionary/wing_warping/DI56.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505105053/http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Dictionary/wing_warping/DI56.htm|archivedate=2008-05-05}}</ref>\n\n'''1899 [[Flash-lamp]]'''\n\nThe electric flash-lamp is a device that uses an electrical circuit to trigger a fuse to ignite explosive powder such as magnesium, for a brief sudden burst of bright light \"flash\" from a chemical reaction of flash powder burning.

The pins are correspondingly shorter and lighter than their ten-pin equivalents. Hence, when the pins are knocked down, they resemble a \"flock of flying ducks\". While the rules remained almost identical to those of the Ten-pin game, one rule change was made: A bowler is allowed to use three bowls on each turn. Strikes would still be strikes and spares still spares, but when all pins were knocked down on the third ball, it counts as a score of ten. During the summer of 1900, some bowlers at Diamond Alleys in Baltimore, Maryland thought it might be interesting to resize the pins to match the 6-inch ball. Thus, the inventor of duckpin bowling, John Van Sant, used a wood turner to do exactly that.<ref>{{cite web|title=Duckpin Bowling History|publisher=Bowling Academy|url=http://bowlingacademy.2gobowl.com/page=Duckpin_Bowling_History}}{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n'''1900 [[Nickel-zinc battery]]'''\n* A nickel-zinc battery is a type of [[rechargeable battery]] that may be used in cordless power tools, cordless telephone, digital cameras, battery operated lawn and garden tools, professional photography, flashlights, electric bike, and light electric vehicle sectors.

Although the banana as an exotic fruit was introduced to the American public in the 1880s, it was later in 1904, that the banana split was invented in the town of Latrobe, Pennsylvania by 23-year-old pharmacy apprentice David Strickler, who was inspired to create a new sundae after seeing a soda jerk during a visit to Atlantic City. According to ''The Food Chronology'', written in 1995 by James Trager, Strickler concocted his sundae to include three scoops of ice cream on a split banana, topped with chocolate syrup, marshmallow, nuts, whipped cream, and a cherry that sold for a dime.

In civil engineering the smaller types are used for road and port construction. The larger types are used in strip-mining operations to move overburden above coal, and for tar-sand mining. A drag line bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom, a large truss-like structure, with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered by means of a number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the bucket and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The drag rope is used to draw the bucket assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuvre of the hoist and the drag ropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. The dragline excavator was invented in 1904 by John W.

In 1911, [[Charles F. Kettering]] invented the automobile self-starter while working at National Cash Register and then sold them for installation on cars at the Cadillac company. There had been many attempts at producing an electric starter before, but none of them were successful. Most designs at that time called for the use of an electric motor attached to the engine's flywheel. However, in order to fit in the car's engine compartment, the device would have to be small, and therefore it would be unable to produce a sufficient enough amount of torque.<ref>{{cite web|title=Electric Starter|publisher=Bryant University|url=http://web.bryant.edu/~ehu/h364proj/sprg_97/dirksen/electric.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Inventor of self-starter is born|publisher=A&E Television Networks|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=7587|access-date=2010-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212045709/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=7587|archive-date=2010-02-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n'''1911 [[Road surface marking]]'''\n[[File:M-15 centerline 1917.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Dead Man's Curve along the Marquette\u2013Negaunee Road in Michigan shown in 1917 with the first hand-painted centerline]]\nA road surface marking is any kind of device or material that is used on a road surface in order to convey official information for drivers and pedestrians.

In the condenser microphone, one of these plates is made of very light material and acts as the diaphragm. The diaphragm vibrates when struck by sound waves, changing the distance between the two plates and therefore changing the capacitance. Specifically, when the plates are closer together, capacitance increases and a charge current occurs. When the plates are further apart, capacitance decreases and a discharge current occurs. A voltage is required across the capacitor for this to work. This voltage is supplied either by a battery in the mic or by external [[phantom power]]. The condenser microphone was invented in 1916 at [[Bell Laboratories]] by Edward Christopher 'E.C.' Wente, which became possible with the advent of the vacuum tube (valve) to act as an amplifier of the low signal output.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bell Laboratories and The Development of Electrical Recording|publisher=The Stokowski Legacy|url=http://www.stokowski.org/Development_of_Electrical_Recording.htm}}</ref>\n\n'''1916 [[Light switch#Toggle|Light switch (toggle)]]'''\n[[File:Scool 023.jpg|180px|left|thumb|An example of on/off toggle light switches mounted on a wall]]\nA toggle light switch is a switch, most commonly used to operate electric lights, permanently connected equipment, or electrical outlets whereby the switch handle does not control the contacts directly, but through an intermediate arrangement of internal springs and levers.

Generally, the cheese of choice is Cheez Whiz, but American and provolone are common substitutions. The art of cheesesteak preparation lies in the balance of flavors, textures and what is often referred to as the \"drip\" factor. Other toppings may include fried onions, saut\u00e9ed mushrooms, ketchup and hot or sweet peppers. The cheesesteak was invented in 1930 by Philadelphian hot dog vendor [[Pat Olivieri]] who one day decided to substitute beef instead of a hot dog in a hoagie bun. A taxicab driver noticed the alluring aroma and asked for his own sandwich. Through word of mouth, Olivieri's sandwiches the following day were highly sought after by taxi cab drivers around Philadelphia. Due to booming business, Olivieri soon opened up his own shop, [[Pat's King of Steaks]] on 9th Street and Passyunk Avenue. Eventually, according to legend, he added cheese to the steak.

Various parts of the artwork layers are left transparent, to allow other layers to be seen behind them. The movements are calculated and photographed frame-by-frame, with the result being an illusion of depth by having several layers of artwork moving at different speeds. The further away from the camera, the slower the speed. The multiplane effect is sometimes referred to as a parallax process.

To be called acrylic in the United States, the polymer must contain at least 85% acrylonitrile monomer. Typical comonomers are vinyl acetate or methyl acrylate. The Dupont Corporation invented the first acrylic fibers in 1941 and trademarked them under the name \"Orlon\".<ref>{{cite web|title=Orlon : 1941|publisher=DuPont|url=http://www2.dupont.com/Heritage/en_US/1941_dupont/1941_overview.html}}</ref>\n\n'''1941 [[Solid body guitar|Electric guitar (solid body)]]'''\n* A solid body electric guitar, made up of hardwood with a lacquer coating, is an [[electric guitar]] that has no hollow internal cavity to accommodate vibration. There are no sound holes such as those used to amplify string vibrations in acoustic guitars. The sound that is audible in music featuring electric guitars is produced by pickups on the guitar that convert the string vibrations into an electrical signal, usually fed into an [[amplifier]] or a [[Computer speaker|speaker]].

In 1943, Panayottis John Eliomarkakis of Philiadelphia filed U.S. patent #2,434,551 which was issued on January 13, 1948.<ref>{{cite web|title=Magnetic Fuze|publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office|url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=bp9HAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n'''1943 Modern Coal Burning Steam Locomotive'''\n\nThis invention was only primarily used with steam locomotives that had booster valves or superchargers to heat the fire even hotter to produce extra power. The coal used was semi-bituminous and bituminous coal only inside the steam locomotives. Sadly, this invention lasted until 1960 when Diesel's fully replaced American railroads.\n\n'''1943 [[Slinky]]'''\n\nA Slinky or \"Lazy Spring\" is a toy consisting of a helical spring that stretches and can bounce up and down. It can perform a number of tricks, including traveling down a flight of steps end-over-end as it stretches and re-forms itself with the aid of gravity and its own momentum. The Slinky was invented in 1943 by American engineer [[Richard T. James]] while working in his home laboratory to invent a set of springs that could be used to support sensitive instruments on board ships and stabilize them even in rough seas. When he once accidentally knocked one of his springs off a shelf, James saw that, rather than flopping in a heap onto the floor, the spring \"stepped\" in a series of arcs from the shelf, to a stack of books, to a tabletop, to the floor, where it re-coiled itself and stood upright. In 1945, the James first exhibited his new toy at the [[Gimbels]], a department store located in Philadelphia. He sold 400 Slinkys in 90 minutes which was the start of a sensation that continues to this day.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Slinky|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/slinky.html}}</ref>\n\n''' 1945 [[Microwave oven]]'''\n[[File:Microwave.750pix.jpg|180px|left|thumb|A microwave oven with a turn table located inside]]\nA microwave oven cooks or heats food by dielectric heating.

Spencer was working on an active radar set when he noticed a strange sensation, and saw that a peanut candy bar he had in his pocket started to melt. Although he was not the first to notice this phenomenon, as the holder of 120 patents, Spencer was no stranger to discovery and experiment, and realized what was happening. The radar had melted his candy bar with microwaves. The first food to be deliberately cooked with microwaves was popcorn, and the second was an egg.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who Invented Microwaves?|publisher= J.

The driver sets the speed and the system will take over the throttle of the car to maintain the same speed. Cruise control was invented in 1945 by a blind inventor and mechanical engineer named [[Ralph Teetor]]. His idea was born out of the frustration of riding in a car driven by his lawyer, who kept speeding up and slowing down as he talked. The first car with Teetor's system was the Chrysler Imperial in 1958. This system calculated ground speed based on driveshaft rotations and used a solenoid to vary throttle position as needed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ralph Teetor: Inventor of Cruise Control|publisher=Dennis Horvath|url=http://www.cruise-in.com/resource/cismar08.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051104031820/http://www.cruise-in.com/resource/cismar08.htm|archivedate=2005-11-04}}</ref>\n\n'''1945 [[Block heater]]'''\n* A block heater warms the engine of an [[automobile]] in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric heating element connected through a [[power cord]] often routed through the vehicle's [[grille]]. The block heater may replace one of the engine's [[core plug]]s, or may be installed in line with one of the [[radiator]] or heater hoses. The block heater, first known as a head bolt heater, was invented in 1945 by [[Andrew Freeman (inventor)|Andrew Freeman]] in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt heater, which warmed the engine's water jacket and the oil film between cylinder heads and pistons.<ref>{{cite web|title=Your car starts?

This has created some debate about whether or not these structures are actually older than [[Egypt]], which is part of the [[Black Athena]] controversy.<ref>{{cite book|title=Archaeological Fantasies: How Pseudoarchaeology Misrepresents the Past and Misleads the Public|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-30593-8|author=Mary Lefkowitz|authorlink=Mary Lefkowitz|editor=Garrett G.

She suggests that some of the research was done not to determine the reliability of the dating method, as was suggested, but to back up an assumption of age and to make certain points about pyramids and Greek civilization. She notes that not only are the results not very precise, but that other structures mentioned in the research are not in fact pyramids, e.g. a tomb alleged to be the tomb of Amphion and Zethus near Thebes, a structure at Stylidha (Thessaly) which is just a long wall, etc. She also notes the possibility that the stones that were dated might have been recycled from earlier constructions. She also notes that earlier research from the 1930s, confirmed in the 1980s by Fracchia was ignored. She argues that they undertook their research using a novel and previously untested methodology in order to confirm a predetermined theory about the age of these structures.<ref>{{cite book|title=Archaeological Fantasies: How Pseudoarchaeology Misrepresents the Past and Misleads the Public|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-30593-8|author=Mary Lefkowitz|authorlink=Mary Lefkowitz|editor=Garrett G.

They are located in the district of Chacona, part of the town of [[G\u00fc\u00edmar]] on the island of [[Tenerife]] in the [[Canary Islands]]. The structures have been dated to the 19th century and their original function explained as a byproduct of contemporary [[agricultural]] techniques.\n\nAutochthonous [[Guanches|Guanche]] traditions as well as surviving images indicate that similar structures (also known as, \"Morras\", \"Majanos\", \"Molleros\", or \"Paredones\") could once have been found in many locations on the island. However, over time they have been dismantled and used as a cheap building material. In G\u00fc\u00edmar itself there were nine pyramids, only six of which survive.\n\n===China===\n{{Main article|Chinese pyramids}}\n[[File:Tomb of the General 1.jpg|right|thumb|Ancient Korean tomb in [[Ji'an, Jilin|Ji'an]], Northeastern China]]\n\nThere are many square [[Platform mound|flat-topped mound]] tombs in China. The First Emperor [[Qin Shi Huang]] (circa 221 BC, who unified the 7 pre-Imperial Kingdoms) was buried under a large mound outside modern day [[Xi'an]]. In the following centuries about a dozen more [[Han Dynasty]] royals were also buried under [[Frustum|flat-topped pyramidal]] earthworks.\n\n===Mesoamerica===\n{{Main article|Mesoamerican pyramids}}\n\nA number of [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures also built pyramid-shaped structures. [[Mesoamerican pyramids]] were usually stepped, with temples on top, more similar to the Mesopotamian ziggurat than the Egyptian pyramid.\n\nThe largest pyramid by volume is the [[Great Pyramid of Cholula]], in the Mexican state of [[Puebla]]. Constructed from the 3rd century BC to the 9th century AD, this pyramid is considered the largest monument ever constructed anywhere in the world, and is still being excavated. The third largest pyramid in the world, the [[Pyramid of the Sun]], at [[Teotihuacan]] is also located in [[Mexico]]. There is an unusual pyramid with a circular plan at the site of [[Cuicuilco]], now inside [[Mexico City]] and mostly covered with lava from an eruption of the [[Xitle]] Volcano in the 1st century BC. There are several circular stepped pyramids called [[Guachimontones]] in Teuchitl\u00e1n, [[Jalisco]] as well.\n\nPyramids in Mexico were often used as places of [[human sacrifice]]. For the re-consecration of [[Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan]] in 1487, Where, according to [[Michael Harner]], \"one source states 20,000, another 72,344, and several give 80,400\".<ref>\"[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/aztecs/sacrifice.htm The Enigma of Aztec Sacrifice]\".

Among the largest and best-known of these structures is [[Monks Mound]] at the site of [[Cahokia]] in what became [[Illinois]], completed around 1100 AD, which has a base larger than that of the Great Pyramid at Giza. Many of the mounds underwent multiple episodes of mound construction at periodic intervals, some becoming quite large.

In ancient times, these were brightly painted in gold/bronze. Since they were constructed of sun-dried mud-brick, little remains of them.  Ziggurats were built by the [[Sumer]]ians, [[Babylon]]ians, [[Elam]]ites, [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadians]], and [[Assyria]]ns for local religions.

Sun-baked [[brick]]s made up the core of the ziggurat with facings of fired bricks on the outside. The facings were often glazed in different colors and may have had [[Astrology|astrological]] significance. Kings sometimes had their names engraved on these glazed bricks. The number of tiers ranged from two to seven. It is assumed that they had shrines at the top, but there is no archaeological evidence for this and the only textual evidence is from [[Herodotus]].<ref>Crawford, page 85</ref> Access to the shrine would have been by a series of ramps on one side of the ziggurat or by a spiral ramp from base to summit.\n\n=== Egypt ===\n{{Main article|Egyptian pyramids}}\n\nThe most famous pyramids are the [[Egyptian pyramids|Egyptian]] \u2014 huge structures built of brick or stone, some of which are among the world's largest constructions.

The latest dates available from scientific dating have been estimated around the 5th and 4th centuries.

She also notes that earlier research from the 1930s, confirmed in the 1980s by Fracchia was ignored. She argues that they undertook their research using a novel and previously untested methodology in order to confirm a predetermined theory about the age of these structures.<ref>{{cite book|title=Archaeological Fantasies: How Pseudoarchaeology Misrepresents the Past and Misleads the Public|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-30593-8|author=Mary Lefkowitz|authorlink=Mary Lefkowitz|editor=Garrett G.

Wentworth was one of five [[military junior college]]s in the United States. The institution was founded in 1880 and closed in 2017.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\n\nLexington's [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Battle of Lexington I|Battle of the Hemp Bales]] was still a recent memory when [[Stephen G. Wentworth]] founded Wentworth Military Academy in 1880. By the 1870s, the town had already attained the reputation as the \"Athens of the West\" for its many academic institutions. Lexington was home to three notable schools for girls. [[Lexington Baptist Female College]] was started in 1850 in the old county courthouse that had been abandoned upon the construction of the new [[Lafayette County Courthouse (Missouri)|Lafayette County Courthouse]], built in 1847 and still in use today. In 1869 the Baptist Female College moved its operation to the former home of [[Pony Express]] Founder [[William B. Waddell (Pony Express founder)|William B. Waddell]] at the corner of 13th and South Streets. Elizabeth Aull Seminary was opened in the fall of 1860 and operated in a large building on Highland Avenue. [[Central Female College]], later [[Central College for Women]], began in 1868 and, in 1871, took over the old [[Masonic College]] on the grounds of the Battlefield. However, Lexington's educators, business leaders and ministers had made numerous attempts to establish a school for boys and young men. Public schools were not yet widespread and there was a glaring need for a boys' school, but none had been successful. The most visible failed effort was the [[Masonic College|Masonic College of Missouri]], which moved to Lexington in 1847 and operated until 1859.\n\n{{Infobox NRHP\n|name = Wentworth Military Academy\n|embed=\n|nrhp_type = hd|nocat=yes\n|image = WMAAdminBldg.jpg\n|caption = Wentworth Military Academy Administration Building\n|location= Washington Ave. and 18th St., [[Lexington, Missouri]]\n|locmapin = Missouri#USA\n|built = {{start date|1883}}\n|architect = Multiple\n|architecture = Greek Revival, Italianate\n|added = November 24, 1980\n|area = {{convert|15.2|acre}}\n|refnum = 80002373<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Wentworth Male Academy ===\n\nOn May 12, 1879, Wentworth's 27-year-old son William died. As a memorial, Wentworth focused his attention on finally making a school for boys a reality in Lexington. In the spring of 1880, Mr. Wentworth announced that a new school named Wentworth Male Academy would begin operation in the fall. Mr. Wentworth had a long record of public service to Lexington. A local editorial writer proclaimed that Wentworth was \"One of our oldest, most generous and most worthy citizens\" and \"no nobler name can this community furnish [the new school]. \" On May 24, 1880, Mr. Wentworth bought the \"New Presbyterian Church\" at the southwest corner of 18th and Main Streets, directed that it be fitted up for the next term, and gave the school solid financial backing. Although his financial involvement was limited to the Academy's early years of operation, his foresight led to the establishment of the first board of trustees and his generosity provided a firm foundation for the school.\n\nWentworth also announced that 22-year-old Benjamin Lewis Hobson, the son of the local Presbyterian minister who had run a fledgling private boys\u2019 school in town the previous year, would be given charge of W.M.A. Young Hobson had graduated from [[Centre College]] in [[Danville, Kentucky]], with a degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1877, and had spent the next two years as teacher and then principal of [[Spencer Institute]] in [[Taylorsville, Kentucky]]. In the summer of 1879, he had returned to his hometown of Lexington and started Hobson's Select School for Boys.\n\nBenjamin Hobson knew that he could not operate the new school alone, and he turned to [[Sandford Sellers]], a 26-year-old friend and former classmate at Centre College in [[Kentucky]]. Sellers eagerly accepted Hobson's invitation to join him as co-principal at Wentworth Male Academy. When Hobson left to pursue a career in the ministry at the end of the 1880\u201381 school year, Sellers took full charge of the academy.\n\n=== Wentworth Military Academy ===\n\nSandford Sellers became the force who forged Wentworth's national reputation, and his hand would guide the school for the next 58 years. In the early days, he handled all the institution's administrative affairs, academic planning, and student recruitment on his own, canvassing surrounding areas on horseback. In 1882, Wentworth became a [[military school]], and Sellers hired Captain David W. Fleet, a graduate of [[Virginia Military Institute]], as the first Commandant. Fleet brought VMI terms such as \"rats\", \"rears\", and \"Old Boys\" to the school. The school officially changed its name to '''Wentworth Military Academy''' in 1890.\n\nSellers' skills as educator, administrator, businessman, and promoter saw the institution through its first half-century of growth, and his vision remained throughout the history of the school. He led Wentworth through economic panics of the 1890s, when he struggled to keep enrollment above 100, and through the boom times of World War I, when enrollment more than doubled to over 500 cadets. He also oversaw the addition of the junior college in 1923.\n\nDuring much of the 20th century, the annual football game with rival [[Kemper Military School and College]] in [[Boonville, Missouri]] was a huge event on Thanksgiving Day, with both corps of cadets boarding trains and either meeting on their home fields, or sometimes meeting on a neutral field in [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]] or [[Marshall, Missouri]]. The Kansas City and St. Louis newspapers referred to the gridiron battle as the \"Little Army-Navy Game\", and gave front-page coverage to the outcome. This rivalry ended with the 2002 closure of Kemper.\n\nBy the mid-1920s, Sandford Sellers, handed over much of the day-to-day operations of the school to his sons, Sandford Sellers, Jr., superintendent from 1923 to 1933, and [[James M. Sellers]], Commandant and Assistant Superintendent. But Sandford Sellers stayed very involved until his death in 1938 after a fall in the school gymnasium.\n\n=== From the Great Depression to post-World War II prosperity ===\n\nWhen the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s hit the country, Wentworth, like many institutions across the country, struggled to survive. In 1933, Colonel [[James M. Sellers]] assumed the superintendency of the school and was soon joined at the helm by Colonel [[Lester B. Wikoff]], treasurer and business manager. Together, Sellers\u2019 natural leadership and Wikoff's business acumen would lead the school to new heights. Colonel Sellers and Colonel Wikoff guided the school through the lean years of the 1930s and into the prosperity of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. During their term of leadership, Wentworth added a number of buildings to the campus, including the Sellers-Wikoff Scholastic Building, the Memorial Chapel, Sandford Sellers Hall, and the Wikoff Field House. In addition, a unique military aviator training program complete with its own airport was launched to train pilots. A highlight of the Sellers-Wikoff era was President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s speech to the cadet corps at Wentworth's 75th anniversary celebration in 1954.\n\nIn 1960, Sellers retired as superintendent but remained as president of the school, and Wikoff served as superintendent from 1960 to 1971. During that time, Wentworth had unparalleled enrollment, averaging over 550 students a year. Under Wikoff's leadership, the {{convert|65000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Wikoff Field House opened in 1966, including three basketball courts, a Laykold-type indoor track, a racquetball court, a weight room, a wrestling room, and a pool. Among the signature programs that Wentworth offered from 1966 until its closing was the Army's two-year [[Early Commissioning Program]], an Army [[Reserve Officers Training Corps]] (ROTC) program through which qualified students can earn a commission as a [[Second Lieutenant]] after two years of college. Wentworth also participated in the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] [[Falcon Foundation]] Scholarship program beginning in 1971 and continuing through 2016. Among the very first class of Falcon Scholars at Wentworth was General [[Mark A. Welsh]] who would go on to be [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|20th Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force]].\n\n=== Continuity and change in the post-Vietnam era ===\n\nIn 1973, a third generation of the Sellers family assumed leadership of the Academy when Colonel [[James M. Sellers, Jr.]], a 1945 Wentworth graduate, was named as superintendent. In the early 1970s, the school was again faced with crisis. Anti-military backlash from the country's continued involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], combined with double-digit inflation, caused enrollment to plummet. Many military schools across the country simply closed their doors. Wentworth was dealt an additional blow when, in 1975, a fire destroyed two buildings and severely damaged others, causing the loss of over {{convert|32000|sqft|m2|-2}} of space.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Colonel J. M. Sellers, Jr., was able to stabilize enrollment by 1978 and lead the academy through another period of growth. In 1980, Wentworth celebrated its centennial year, with Vice-President [[Walter Mondale]] addressing the corps of cadets at commencement. In the early 1980s, enrollment continued to rise, peaking at over 400 cadets in 1984. In 1990, Colonel Sellers, Sr., who taught Latin until he was 95 years old, died, and Colonel Sellers, Jr., resigned as superintendent, ending a remarkable 110 years of the Sellers family's continuous involvement in the active operation of the academy.\n\n=== Last years ===\n\nIn the 1990s, Wentworth struggled with enrollment. As part of a new approach, female cadets were admitted for the first time in 1993, and soon made up about twenty-five percent of the corps. The Wentworth Foundation was created in an attempt to build stronger financial footing. In 2002, [[Major General]] [[John H. Little]], Wentworth Class of 1961, returned to campus as superintendent. Under his stewardship, Tillotson barracks was constructed.\n\n=== Closure and auction of assets ===\n\nOn April 7, 2017, the Board of Trustees announced that Wentworth Military Academy & College would be closed, with final commencement to occur on May 13, 2017 and the official date of closure set for May 31, 2017. An email was sent out to all alumni and employees, parents and cadets were informed. The announcement cited declining enrollment, an aging campus, and a lack of financial support for continued operations. Plans were announced to settle the school's debts, allow students and staff to seek enrollment and employment elsewhere.

Wentworth was one of five [[military junior college]]s in the United States. The institution was founded in 1880 and closed in 2017.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\n\nLexington's [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[Battle of Lexington I|Battle of the Hemp Bales]] was still a recent memory when [[Stephen G. Wentworth]] founded Wentworth Military Academy in 1880. By the 1870s, the town had already attained the reputation as the \"Athens of the West\" for its many academic institutions. Lexington was home to three notable schools for girls. [[Lexington Baptist Female College]] was started in 1850 in the old county courthouse that had been abandoned upon the construction of the new [[Lafayette County Courthouse (Missouri)|Lafayette County Courthouse]], built in 1847 and still in use today. In 1869 the Baptist Female College moved its operation to the former home of [[Pony Express]] Founder [[William B. Waddell (Pony Express founder)|William B. Waddell]] at the corner of 13th and South Streets. Elizabeth Aull Seminary was opened in the fall of 1860 and operated in a large building on Highland Avenue. [[Central Female College]], later [[Central College for Women]], began in 1868 and, in 1871, took over the old [[Masonic College]] on the grounds of the Battlefield. However, Lexington's educators, business leaders and ministers had made numerous attempts to establish a school for boys and young men. Public schools were not yet widespread and there was a glaring need for a boys' school, but none had been successful. The most visible failed effort was the [[Masonic College|Masonic College of Missouri]], which moved to Lexington in 1847 and operated until 1859.\n\n{{Infobox NRHP\n|name = Wentworth Military Academy\n|embed=\n|nrhp_type = hd|nocat=yes\n|image = WMAAdminBldg.jpg\n|caption = Wentworth Military Academy Administration Building\n|location= Washington Ave. and 18th St., [[Lexington, Missouri]]\n|locmapin = Missouri#USA\n|built = {{start date|1883}}\n|architect = Multiple\n|architecture = Greek Revival, Italianate\n|added = November 24, 1980\n|area = {{convert|15.2|acre}}\n|refnum = 80002373<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n}}\n\n=== Wentworth Male Academy ===\n\nOn May 12, 1879, Wentworth's 27-year-old son William died. As a memorial, Wentworth focused his attention on finally making a school for boys a reality in Lexington. In the spring of 1880, Mr. Wentworth announced that a new school named Wentworth Male Academy would begin operation in the fall. Mr. Wentworth had a long record of public service to Lexington. A local editorial writer proclaimed that Wentworth was \"One of our oldest, most generous and most worthy citizens\" and \"no nobler name can this community furnish [the new school]. \" On May 24, 1880, Mr. Wentworth bought the \"New Presbyterian Church\" at the southwest corner of 18th and Main Streets, directed that it be fitted up for the next term, and gave the school solid financial backing. Although his financial involvement was limited to the Academy's early years of operation, his foresight led to the establishment of the first board of trustees and his generosity provided a firm foundation for the school.\n\nWentworth also announced that 22-year-old Benjamin Lewis Hobson, the son of the local Presbyterian minister who had run a fledgling private boys\u2019 school in town the previous year, would be given charge of W.M.A. Young Hobson had graduated from [[Centre College]] in [[Danville, Kentucky]], with a degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1877, and had spent the next two years as teacher and then principal of [[Spencer Institute]] in [[Taylorsville, Kentucky]]. In the summer of 1879, he had returned to his hometown of Lexington and started Hobson's Select School for Boys.\n\nBenjamin Hobson knew that he could not operate the new school alone, and he turned to [[Sandford Sellers]], a 26-year-old friend and former classmate at Centre College in [[Kentucky]]. Sellers eagerly accepted Hobson's invitation to join him as co-principal at Wentworth Male Academy. When Hobson left to pursue a career in the ministry at the end of the 1880\u201381 school year, Sellers took full charge of the academy.\n\n=== Wentworth Military Academy ===\n\nSandford Sellers became the force who forged Wentworth's national reputation, and his hand would guide the school for the next 58 years. In the early days, he handled all the institution's administrative affairs, academic planning, and student recruitment on his own, canvassing surrounding areas on horseback. In 1882, Wentworth became a [[military school]], and Sellers hired Captain David W. Fleet, a graduate of [[Virginia Military Institute]], as the first Commandant. Fleet brought VMI terms such as \"rats\", \"rears\", and \"Old Boys\" to the school. The school officially changed its name to '''Wentworth Military Academy''' in 1890.\n\nSellers' skills as educator, administrator, businessman, and promoter saw the institution through its first half-century of growth, and his vision remained throughout the history of the school. He led Wentworth through economic panics of the 1890s, when he struggled to keep enrollment above 100, and through the boom times of World War I, when enrollment more than doubled to over 500 cadets. He also oversaw the addition of the junior college in 1923.\n\nDuring much of the 20th century, the annual football game with rival [[Kemper Military School and College]] in [[Boonville, Missouri]] was a huge event on Thanksgiving Day, with both corps of cadets boarding trains and either meeting on their home fields, or sometimes meeting on a neutral field in [[Sedalia, Missouri|Sedalia]] or [[Marshall, Missouri]]. The Kansas City and St. Louis newspapers referred to the gridiron battle as the \"Little Army-Navy Game\", and gave front-page coverage to the outcome. This rivalry ended with the 2002 closure of Kemper.\n\nBy the mid-1920s, Sandford Sellers, handed over much of the day-to-day operations of the school to his sons, Sandford Sellers, Jr., superintendent from 1923 to 1933, and [[James M. Sellers]], Commandant and Assistant Superintendent. But Sandford Sellers stayed very involved until his death in 1938 after a fall in the school gymnasium.\n\n=== From the Great Depression to post-World War II prosperity ===\n\nWhen the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s hit the country, Wentworth, like many institutions across the country, struggled to survive. In 1933, Colonel [[James M. Sellers]] assumed the superintendency of the school and was soon joined at the helm by Colonel [[Lester B. Wikoff]], treasurer and business manager. Together, Sellers\u2019 natural leadership and Wikoff's business acumen would lead the school to new heights. Colonel Sellers and Colonel Wikoff guided the school through the lean years of the 1930s and into the prosperity of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. During their term of leadership, Wentworth added a number of buildings to the campus, including the Sellers-Wikoff Scholastic Building, the Memorial Chapel, Sandford Sellers Hall, and the Wikoff Field House. In addition, a unique military aviator training program complete with its own airport was launched to train pilots. A highlight of the Sellers-Wikoff era was President [[Harry S. Truman]]'s speech to the cadet corps at Wentworth's 75th anniversary celebration in 1954.\n\nIn 1960, Sellers retired as superintendent but remained as president of the school, and Wikoff served as superintendent from 1960 to 1971. During that time, Wentworth had unparalleled enrollment, averaging over 550 students a year. Under Wikoff's leadership, the {{convert|65000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Wikoff Field House opened in 1966, including three basketball courts, a Laykold-type indoor track, a racquetball court, a weight room, a wrestling room, and a pool. Among the signature programs that Wentworth offered from 1966 until its closing was the Army's two-year [[Early Commissioning Program]], an Army [[Reserve Officers Training Corps]] (ROTC) program through which qualified students can earn a commission as a [[Second Lieutenant]] after two years of college. Wentworth also participated in the [[United States Air Force Academy|Air Force Academy]] [[Falcon Foundation]] Scholarship program beginning in 1971 and continuing through 2016. Among the very first class of Falcon Scholars at Wentworth was General [[Mark A. Welsh]] who would go on to be [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force|20th Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force]].\n\n=== Continuity and change in the post-Vietnam era ===\n\nIn 1973, a third generation of the Sellers family assumed leadership of the Academy when Colonel [[James M. Sellers, Jr.]], a 1945 Wentworth graduate, was named as superintendent. In the early 1970s, the school was again faced with crisis. Anti-military backlash from the country's continued involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], combined with double-digit inflation, caused enrollment to plummet. Many military schools across the country simply closed their doors. Wentworth was dealt an additional blow when, in 1975, a fire destroyed two buildings and severely damaged others, causing the loss of over {{convert|32000|sqft|m2|-2}} of space.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Colonel J. M. Sellers, Jr., was able to stabilize enrollment by 1978 and lead the academy through another period of growth. In 1980, Wentworth celebrated its centennial year, with Vice-President [[Walter Mondale]] addressing the corps of cadets at commencement. In the early 1980s, enrollment continued to rise, peaking at over 400 cadets in 1984. In 1990, Colonel Sellers, Sr., who taught Latin until he was 95 years old, died, and Colonel Sellers, Jr., resigned as superintendent, ending a remarkable 110 years of the Sellers family's continuous involvement in the active operation of the academy.\n\n=== Last years ===\n\nIn the 1990s, Wentworth struggled with enrollment. As part of a new approach, female cadets were admitted for the first time in 1993, and soon made up about twenty-five percent of the corps. The Wentworth Foundation was created in an attempt to build stronger financial footing. In 2002, [[Major General]] [[John H. Little]], Wentworth Class of 1961, returned to campus as superintendent. Under his stewardship, Tillotson barracks was constructed.\n\n=== Closure and auction of assets ===\n\nOn April 7, 2017, the Board of Trustees announced that Wentworth Military Academy & College would be closed, with final commencement to occur on May 13, 2017 and the official date of closure set for May 31, 2017. An email was sent out to all alumni and employees, parents and cadets were informed. The announcement cited declining enrollment, an aging campus, and a lack of financial support for continued operations. Plans were announced to settle the school's debts, allow students and staff to seek enrollment and employment elsewhere.  The physical campus is for sale as are the Wentworth Suite of Historic Homes (by Welcome Home Realty of Lexington MO), assets,  and monuments honoring 130 years of valor and achievement will be sold to the highest bidder by Oldham Auctions of Bates City MO over the next few months.\n\n== Academic accreditation ==\n\nWentworth's college was accredited by the [[Higher Learning Commission]]. The Higher Learning Commission placed Wentworth on probation in late 2015 \"because of concerns related to integrity regarding the College's finances and resources to support its academic programs and operations.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hlcommission.org/download/_PublicDisclosureNotices/Wentworth_Military_Academy_and_College_PDN.pdf |title=Public Disclosure Notice on Wentworth Military Academy and College |publisher=[[Higher Learning Commission]] |date=November 5, 2015 |accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> The high school was accredited by [[AdvancED]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.advanc-ed.org/oasis2/u/par/accreditation/summary?institutionId=7476|title=AdvancED - Institution Summary|website=www.advanc-ed.org|accessdate=Jul 20, 2019}}</ref> formerly the ([[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]]).\n\n== Current status of the school and grounds ==\n\nFollowing its closure in May 2017, the campus was put up for sale, but has yet to find a buyer.
