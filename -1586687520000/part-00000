They are currently in service with the [[Russian Navy]] with some of the vessels planned to be modernized as Project 949AM, to extend their service life and increase combat capabilities.\n\nThe Project 949 submarines were the largest cruise missile submarines in service until the {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|0}} [[ballistic missile submarine]]s were converted to carry [[cruise missile]]s in 2007. They are the fourth largest class of submarines in [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] and length. Only the Soviet {{sclass2-|Typhoon|submarine|0}}, Russian {{sclass2-|Borei|submarine|0}} and American ''Ohio''-class ballistic missile submarines are larger.\n\n==History==\nThe first submarine of Project 949 was [[Keel laying|laid down]] in the mid-1970s and was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in 1980. In 1982 an updated and larger version (Project 949A) replaced the earlier version. In total thirteen submarines were constructed. The Oscar class was designed to attack [[NATO]] [[carrier battle group]]s using long-range [[P-700 Granit|SS-N-19 \"Shipwreck\"]] [[anti-ship missile]]s and targeting data provided by the [[EORSAT]] satellite system (via the submarine's \"Punch Bowl\" antenna).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://faculty.fordham.edu/siddiqi/writings/p14_siddiqi_jbis_rorsat_1999.pdf |title=Staring at the Sea: The Soviet RORSAT and EORSAT Programmes |last=Siddiqi |first=Asif |pages=397\u2013416 |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=52 |number=11 |date=November 1999 |access-date=2013-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103225054/http://faculty.fordham.edu/siddiqi/writings/p14_siddiqi_jbis_rorsat_1999.pdf |archive-date=2015-01-03 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://i.imgur.com/HsZrBR7.jpg |title=data |website=i.imgur.com |format=JPG |access-date=2016-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826133447/http://i.imgur.com/HsZrBR7.jpg |archive-date=2016-08-26 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/oscar-submarine/|title=SSGN Oscar II Class (Project 949.A) (Kursk) \u2013 Naval Technology|work=naval-technology.com|access-date=2013-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814030754/http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/oscar-submarine/|archive-date=2013-08-14|url-status=live}}</ref> In the financial problems that followed the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] the Oscar class was prioritized by the Russian Navy and when many older submarine classes were retired the Oscar class remained active in both the [[Northern Fleet|Northern]] and [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]]s.\n\n===Modernization===\nThe [[Rubin Design Bureau]] started working on Project 949A modernization in 2011, with Zvezdochka and [[Zvezda shipyard|Zvezda]] shipyards to carry out modernization of the vessels.<ref name=lenta.ru>{{cite web|url=https://lenta.ru/news/2011/12/12/antey/|title=\u0410\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430 \"\u0410\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0439\" \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435|website=lenta.ru|date=12 December 2011|accessdate=4 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311145931/https://lenta.ru/news/2011/12/12/antey/|archive-date=11 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In September 2015, Russian Defence Minister [[Sergey Shoygu]] announced during his visit to Zvezda shipyard, that at least three Oscar-class submarines will undergo repair and modernization to extend their service life by 20 years.<ref name=janes2015>{{cite web|url=https://www.janes.com/article/54981/russia-details-ambitious-effort-to-modernise-nuclear-powered-submarines-to-bolster-order-of-battle|title=Russia details ambitious effort to modernise nuclear-powered submarines to bolster order of battle|access-date=4 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202012720/https://www.janes.com/article/54981/russia-details-ambitious-effort-to-modernise-nuclear-powered-submarines-to-bolster-order-of-battle|archive-date=2 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The upgraded submarines will be known as \"Project 949AM\", according to the Russian officials.

They are currently in service with the [[Russian Navy]] with some of the vessels planned to be modernized as Project 949AM, to extend their service life and increase combat capabilities.\n\nThe Project 949 submarines were the largest cruise missile submarines in service until the {{sclass-|Ohio|submarine|0}} [[ballistic missile submarine]]s were converted to carry [[cruise missile]]s in 2007. They are the fourth largest class of submarines in [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] and length. Only the Soviet {{sclass2-|Typhoon|submarine|0}}, Russian {{sclass2-|Borei|submarine|0}} and American ''Ohio''-class ballistic missile submarines are larger.\n\n==History==\nThe first submarine of Project 949 was [[Keel laying|laid down]] in the mid-1970s and was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] in 1980. In 1982 an updated and larger version (Project 949A) replaced the earlier version. In total thirteen submarines were constructed. The Oscar class was designed to attack [[NATO]] [[carrier battle group]]s using long-range [[P-700 Granit|SS-N-19 \"Shipwreck\"]] [[anti-ship missile]]s and targeting data provided by the [[EORSAT]] satellite system (via the submarine's \"Punch Bowl\" antenna).<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://faculty.fordham.edu/siddiqi/writings/p14_siddiqi_jbis_rorsat_1999.pdf |title=Staring at the Sea: The Soviet RORSAT and EORSAT Programmes |last=Siddiqi |first=Asif |pages=397\u2013416 |journal=Journal of the British Interplanetary Society |volume=52 |number=11 |date=November 1999 |access-date=2013-07-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150103225054/http://faculty.fordham.edu/siddiqi/writings/p14_siddiqi_jbis_rorsat_1999.pdf |archive-date=2015-01-03 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://i.imgur.com/HsZrBR7.jpg |title=data |website=i.imgur.com |format=JPG |access-date=2016-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826133447/http://i.imgur.com/HsZrBR7.jpg |archive-date=2016-08-26 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/oscar-submarine/|title=SSGN Oscar II Class (Project 949.A) (Kursk) \u2013 Naval Technology|work=naval-technology.com|access-date=2013-07-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814030754/http://www.naval-technology.com/projects/oscar-submarine/|archive-date=2013-08-14|url-status=live}}</ref> In the financial problems that followed the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] the Oscar class was prioritized by the Russian Navy and when many older submarine classes were retired the Oscar class remained active in both the [[Northern Fleet|Northern]] and [[Pacific Fleet (Russia)|Pacific Fleet]]s.\n\n===Modernization===\nThe [[Rubin Design Bureau]] started working on Project 949A modernization in 2011, with Zvezdochka and [[Zvezda shipyard|Zvezda]] shipyards to carry out modernization of the vessels.<ref name=lenta.ru>{{cite web|url=https://lenta.ru/news/2011/12/12/antey/|title=\u0410\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043b\u043e\u0434\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0430 \"\u0410\u043d\u0442\u0435\u0439\" \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0439\u0434\u0443\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043e\u0440\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435|website=lenta.ru|date=12 December 2011|accessdate=4 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311145931/https://lenta.ru/news/2011/12/12/antey/|archive-date=11 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In September 2015, Russian Defence Minister [[Sergey Shoygu]] announced during his visit to Zvezda shipyard, that at least three Oscar-class submarines will undergo repair and modernization to extend their service life by 20 years.<ref name=janes2015>{{cite web|url=https://www.janes.com/article/54981/russia-details-ambitious-effort-to-modernise-nuclear-powered-submarines-to-bolster-order-of-battle|title=Russia details ambitious effort to modernise nuclear-powered submarines to bolster order of battle|access-date=4 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202012720/https://www.janes.com/article/54981/russia-details-ambitious-effort-to-modernise-nuclear-powered-submarines-to-bolster-order-of-battle|archive-date=2 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The upgraded submarines will be known as \"Project 949AM\", according to the Russian officials.

The external differences between the two classes were that the 949A class is about {{convert|10|m}} longer than its predecessor (~{{convert|154|m}} rather than {{convert|143|m|abbr=on}}), providing space and buoyancy for improved electronics and quieter propulsion.\n\nSome sources speculate that the acoustic performance of the Oscar II class is superior to early {{sclass-|Akula|submarine|4}} but inferior to the ''Akula II'' class as well as subsequent (4th generation) designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/blogs/security/2009/11/subnoise/ |title=China\u2019s Noisy Nuclear Submarines \u00bb FAS Strategic Security Blog |publisher=Fas.org |accessdate=2013-03-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715065441/http://fas.org/blogs/security/2009/11/subnoise/ |archive-date=2014-07-15 |url-status=live }}</ref> It also has a larger fin, and its [[propeller]]s have seven blades instead of four.<ref name=\"fas\" >{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/theater/949.htm |publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]] |title=Project 949 Granit / Oscar I ; Project 949A Antey / Oscar II |accessdate=2011-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227151256/http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/russia/theater/949.htm |archive-date=2011-12-27 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nLike all post-World War II Soviet designs, they are of [[Submarine hull|double hull]] construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://warfare.be/?lang=&linkid=1763&catid=305 |title=949 /A Oscar I/II class |publisher=warfare.be |accessdate=1 January 2012}}</ref> Similarly, like other Soviet submarine designs, Project 949 not only has a [[bridge (nautical)|bridge]] open to the elements on top of the [[sail (submarine)|sail]] but, for use in inclement weather, there is an enclosed bridge forward and slightly below this station.

Harami started rapping seriously in 2018 and sold drugs to support himself and his music. He came into prominence in 2019 with his single \"Chaabian Boyz\" which was featured on his mixtape ''Chaabian Boyz: Volume 1''. It was released in early 2019 and was a collaborative effort with Shaker the Baker. The song was banned by the [[BBC]] due to the nature of the song \"glamorising sexual exploitation\" with lyrics referring to a [[prostitution ring]]. Harami is known for his combination of the languages English and Panjabi in his rap music, a combination not done by any other British rap artist.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} He released his debut five-track extended play album, ''Gundeh Paseh'', later on in the same year.\n\n''Chaabian Boyz: Volume 2'' was released in January 2020. The album features vocals from Shaker the Baker and received over 500,000 streams within 24 hours of release.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Early life==\nHarami was born in East London to parents of [[Pakistani]] descent.

Harami started rapping seriously in 2018 and sold drugs to support himself and his music.

It was released in early 2019 and was a collaborative effort with Shaker the Baker. The song was banned by the [[BBC]] due to the nature of the song \"glamorising sexual exploitation\" with lyrics referring to a [[prostitution ring]].

For a ship, surrender is dated from the time the [[ensign]] is struck.\n\n==In international law==\n\"Colours. A national flag (or a [[battle ensign]]). The colours . . . are hauled down as a token of submission.\"<ref>{{harvp|''Naval Encyclopedia''|1881|p= 148}}.</ref>\n\nInternational law absolutely requires a [[warship|ship of war]] to fly its ensign at the commencement of any hostile acts, i.e., before firing on the enemy.<ref>{{harvp|Halleck|1861|pp= 402\u2013405}}.</ref> During battle there is no purpose in striking the colours other than to indicate surrender.\n\nIt was and is an offense to continue to fight after striking one's colours, and an offense to continue to fire on an enemy after she has struck her colours, unless she indicates by some other action, such as continuing to fire or seeking to escape, that she has not truly surrendered.  For this reason, striking the colours is conclusive evidence of a surrender having taken place in the case of a warship, but not in the case of a merchant ship. What would be [[perfidy]] in the case of a warship is not in the case of a merchant ship: A merchant ship may strike its colours as a [[ruse de guerre]] in an attempt to escape capture, since it does not engage the enemy in combat.<ref>{{harvp|Colombos|1972|p=781}}.</ref>\n\nIn distinction to striking one's colours, hoisting a [[white flag]], in itself, is not an indication of surrender. Rather, hoisting a white flag indicates a request for a [[Parley|truce in order to communicate with the enemy]]. Under the [[Geneva Conventions]], persons carrying or waving a white flag are still not to be fired upon, nor are they allowed to open fire.\n\n==Understood meaning==\n{{Globalize|section|USA|2name=the United States|date=December 2010}}\n\nNailing the colors to the mast is a traditional sign of defiance, indicating that the colors will never be struck, that the ship will never surrender. On 23 September 1779, Capt. [[Sir Richard Pearson|Richard Pearson]] of [[HMS Serapis (1779)|HMS ''Serapis'']], nailed the British ensign to the ensign staff with his own hands before going into battle against [[Continental Navy]] ship ''[[USS Bonhomme Richard (1765)|Bonhomme Richard]]''.<ref>{{harvp|Bennett|2006|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=MNrKALVkHCcC&pg=PA96 96]}}.</ref> He had to tear it down himself when surrendering. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nDuring the same battle, ''Bonhomme Richard'''s ensign was shot away. When Pearson saw that the colors were down, he asked Capt. [[John Paul Jones]]<nowiki/>of ''Bonhomme Richard'' if Jones had struck his colors.

For this reason, striking the colours is conclusive evidence of a surrender having taken place in the case of a warship, but not in the case of a merchant ship. What would be [[perfidy]] in the case of a warship is not in the case of a merchant ship: A merchant ship may strike its colours as a [[ruse de guerre]] in an attempt to escape capture, since it does not engage the enemy in combat.<ref>{{harvp|Colombos|1972|p=781}}.</ref>\n\nIn distinction to striking one's colours, hoisting a [[white flag]], in itself, is not an indication of surrender. Rather, hoisting a white flag indicates a request for a [[Parley|truce in order to communicate with the enemy]].
