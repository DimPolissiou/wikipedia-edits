It premiered on [[Disney Channel]] on July 26, 1986 as a part of the channel's \"Premiere Films\" presentation (a precursor to the Disney Channel Original Movies banner).\n\n[[Hayley Mills]] is the only actress that returned from the original film. She continues to portray Susan and Sharon, the twins who were separated at age one, met up twelve years later at summer camp, switched places and went on to reunite their divorced parents.\n\nThe film focuses on Sharon's daughter, Nikki, who tries to hook her mother up with her best friend Mary's father, portrayed by [[Tom Skerritt]]. It was a success for the Disney Channel and it later spawned two more made-for-television sequels, both produced in 1989.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film takes place twenty-five years after the original film. Sharon Ferris (n\u00e9e McKendrick) is divorced and living as a single mother in [[Tampa, Florida]]. Her daughter, Nikki, is not happy about their impending move to [[New York City]] and Sharon's decision to send her to an all-girls school in the fall. While in summer school, Nikki makes enemies with Jessica Dintruff (Tannen) but befriends Mary Grand. Mary's father, Bill Grand, has been widowed for four years. To stop Nikki from moving to New York City and to see their parents happily married, the girls scheme to set them up.\n\nNikki and Mary trick their parents into meeting each other by sending Sharon flowers that are supposedly from Bill, but they do not just fall madly in love with each other as the girls had hoped, so they contact Sharon's twin sister, Susan Carey (n\u00e9e Evers). She is married and still living in [[California]]. She is convinced by the girls to fly to Tampa to help them by posing as Sharon and going on a few dates just to get things started.\n\nSusan, disguised as Sharon, \"accidentally\" bumps into Bill at a bar called the Press Box and watches a few innings of a baseball game with him.  The real Sharon detests baseball, and is confused when Bill drops by her workplace the next day and mentions how much fun they had. Susan and Bill cross paths a couple more times over the next few days. Florence (Cromwell) Bill and Mary's maid, begins to suspect that something is awry.\n\nSharon discovers the girls' scheme and decides to trick them instead. She contacts Brian Carey (Harvey) Susan's husband, who is a pilot for [[Trans World Airlines]], and involves him in her scheme. While Susan and Bill are on a date, the real Sharon and Brian pretend to also be on one, with Sharon dressed as a different woman.\n\nSusan becomes distracted and clumsy on her date while watching her husband. Finally having had enough, she announces to Bill that the man she is watching is her husband. She storms over to their table, but begins laughing when she sees her sister underneath a black wig.\n\nSusan and Sharon clear up the situation for Bill, and Sharon says that she does not have romantic feelings for him, and would like it if they just remained friends.  \n\nA going away party is thrown for Sharon and Nikki on the boat of her boss, Mr. Elias. Sharon and Bill meet in the cabin while Nikki and Mary go get something from the car. The girls release the ropes from the boat and push it away from the dock. The guests begin arriving and watch helplessly as the boat drifts away.\n\nSharon and Bill are enjoying each other's company, but wonder where everyone is. They go to the deck, see how far out they are from the shore, and then, Bill kisses Sharon. The scene switches to the wedding. Mary and Nikki are finally step-sisters and Nikki doesn't have to move to New York City.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Hayley Mills]] as Sharon Ferris and Susan Carey\n* [[Tom Skerritt]] as William \"Bill\" Grand\n* [[Carrie Kei Heim]] as Nicole \"Nikki\" Ferris\n* [[Bridgette Andersen]] as Mary Grand\n* Alex Harvey as Brian Carey\n* Gloria Cromwell as Florence\n* Judith Tannen as Jessica Dintroff\n\n== Production ==\n=== Writing ===\nThe idea of a second film was announced in 1985.

I thought what they wanted to do was try to repeat the original film in some way. I wasn't too sure that was a very good idea. It was a good film, and it has passed the test of time,\" Mills said to the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''.\n\n\"I did hesitate before saying yes,\" said Mills, \"first because it was always my favorite film and I wasn't sure about making a sequel. Second, because it's taken me so long to try to break away from my Disney image. It's been a real impediment toward getting the kind of roles I want. But everyone at Disney was so enthusiastic about the project that I finally agreed to do it.

The magazine was launched in 1974 as a handmade newsletter<ref name=\"FolioMagazine\">{{cite web|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2009/relix-returns-dead|title=Relix Returns from the Dead|work=Folio Magazine|date=May 3, 2009|accessdate=December 10, 2012|author=Stableford, Dylan}}</ref> devoted to connecting people who recorded [[Grateful Dead]] concerts.

As the popularity of trading live concerts on tape increased, a practice the Grateful Dead allowed and ultimately encouraged, Kippel realized that he needed to get a more streamlined method of getting tapers together to trade.  He started a newsletter to help his fellow tape-traders connect rather than all of them having to go through him.  He and friend Jim McGurn came up with the name ''Dead Relix'' because each Dead tape, for them, was a relic. Jerry Moore became the editor-in-chief of Dead Relix, a relatively small magazine dedicated to taping and tape collecting the Grateful and bands of a similar ilk. The first issue was released in September 1974 with an initial print run of 200.  Kippel allowed a friend, who taught printing in a high school printing shop  to 'use' Dead Relix to teach printing to the students.\n\nThe first issue featured a black and white drawing of a large skull in the center with a horned, winged creature below it and marijuana leaves sprouting around it. On the upper left it says: \"Dedicated to the memory of the world's sneakiest tape collector-[[Richard Nixon|Tricky Dicky]].\"  The issue cost $1.25. With only 50 initial subscribers, Kippel printed 200 copies.  However, once word spread of the magazine, subscriptions rose quickly. The first issue was released shortly after the Grateful Dead announced a hiatus. The timing was auspicious as ''Dead Relix'' now became the only way for Deadheads, who frequently only saw each other on tour with the band, to stay in touch and up-to-date with band and its members' happenings. The group's hiatus also created the opportunity for ''Dead Relix'' to broaden its coverage as it came to include other Dead-esque bands on the San Francisco scene like [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]], [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]] and [[Hot Tuna]].\n\n== Transitions ==\nAt the end of 1978, ''Relix'' underwent a major transition that propelled it from more of a newsletter to a true magazine.  The change started with a new editor.  Jerry Moore left the magazine and Jeff Tamarkin replaced him.  Tamarkin had bigger plans for ''Relix''.  He felt it needed to branch out and he wanted to broaden the coverage to include more different types of music\u2014punk, metal, new wave, even pop. Kippel gave him free rein to expand as he wanted.  Dead was dropped from the title and the subject matter changed dramatically.<ref name=\"Chronicling\">{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/103491927.html?dids=103491927:103491927&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+05%2C+1989&author=By+John+Anderson&pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&desc=CHRONICLING+%60BAY+ROCK%27+-+THE+SAN+FRANCISCO+KIND+Their+Subscribers+Are%2C+Uh%2C+Grateful&pqatl=google | title=Chronicling 'Bay Rock' - The San Francisco Kind: Their Subscribers Are, Uh, Grateful | newspaper=Newsday | date=October 5, 1989 | accessdate=December 10, 2012 | author=Anderson, John}} {{Paywall}}</ref> The result was a greater readership and many angry Deadheads.  Kippel attempted to appease the worries of ''Relix''{{'}}s longtime supporters in a letter from the publisher in the Jan/Feb 1979 issue. He wrote:\n\n{{Cquote|The key to all this is that as people who live for and by music, we should see and listen to other music, and that is the purpose and function of RELIX: to be the eyes and ears for our readers, and to report back and show and tell you, our readers what's going on around the music scene WITH AN OPEN MIND and we at RELIX do hope that you, our readers, will have an open mind for music.}}\n\nIn 1979, the [[Blues Brothers]], [[The Who]], and even [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] appeared on the cover. However, the Grateful Dead were never too far removed from ''Relix'' as pictures and interviews with the Dead still appeared in the magazine just with less frequency.\nTamarkin's tenure with ''Relix'' was brief, lasting only two years (today, he remains a contributing editor). His replacement was Toni Brown. While Brown appreciated Tamarkin's adjustments to the magazine, she recognized that ''Relix'' was straying from its Deadhead roots.  Her first act was to put \"Dead\" back into the title although it appeared in small print above the \"R\" in ''Relix''. Brown, who married Kippel in 1980, took his job as publisher and assumed full responsibility over the future of the magazine.\n\nWhen the Grateful Dead released ''[[In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)|In the Dark]]'' in 1987, the band\u2019s popularity grew exponentially with the help of radio airplay and \"Touch of Grey\" becoming the group's first song to chart. It played sold-out stadiums. The media became more involved with the Grateful Dead scene as did the police and the government's Drug Enforcement Administration. Deadheads were targeted for drug use and gained something of a negative reputation. ''Relix'' recognized the profiling and tried to educate Deadheads about how to avoid the police and what to bring (and not bring) with you to shows.\n\n== Merchandise and record company ==\nTo keep the magazine profitable, Kippel began dealing an array of collectibles geared towards ''Relix'' readers. This prompted him to create a merchandising divisions of the ''Relix'' company called Rockin' Relix/<ref name=\"Chronicling\"/> Relix International.  This led to many ties in the music merchandise world and Kippel gained connections all over the music scene. Kippel started a record company which he called [[Relix Records]]<ref name=\"Chronicling\"/> in 1980, after prompting to do so from Grateful Dead lyricist, [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]]. Now, the ''Relix'' corporation was flourishing. ''Relix'' kept close ties with the record stores that were buying their magazines, merchandise, and now, the albums of the artists it represented. ''Relix'' records existed for 20 years and released over 120 records including many magazine favorites, such as [[Jorma Kaukonen]], Hot Tuna, [[Free Grass Union]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.relix.com/relix/issues/2010/07/26/august|title=Relix - Issues - August|date=2010-07-26|work=Relix|accessdate=24 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809203807/http://www.relix.com/relix/issues/2010/07/26/august|archivedate=9 August 2011}}</ref> the New Riders of the Purple Sage, [[Wavy Gravy]], Commander Cody and many more. Brown also created a forum in the magazine for readers to correspond with incarcerated Deadheads, many who were convicted of non-violent drug offences.\n\n== Phish and Relix ==\nIn October 1989, ''Relix'' covered the band [[Phish]]. Mick Skidmore heard an unreleased copy of [[Junta (album)|Junta]] and decided to write a review. He closed the piece with, \"I hope we get a chance to hear more from these extremely talented musicians in the not too distant future. Meanwhile, this tape comes highly recommended.\" Phish is now one of the most popular bands in the country and frequently appears in the magazine's pages.\n\n== Relix after Jerry Garcia's death ==\nFollowing [[Jerry Garcia]]'s death on August 9, 1995, ''Relix'' was once again the focus of media attention. ''Relix'' put a close up picture of Garcia on the cover which was used by media outlets all over the country. Publisher Toni Brown remembers, \"Wherever I looked, ''Relix'' was there. I admit that it bolstered sales to heights we'd never seen, but I would have preferred to have Jerry back.\" People looked to ''Relix'' for how to cope with the loss of Garcia, the band and its constant tours, tours that were for many provided their livelihood in selling handmade/homemade merchandise and food.\n\n''Relix'' began focusing on a wider of array of bands including [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[Phish]], [[Widespread Panic]], [[Blues Traveler]], [[Free Grass Union]], [[The String Cheese Incident]], [[moe.]], [[The Disco Biscuits]], [[Leftover Salmon]], [[God Street Wine]] and [[Strangefolk]]. In 1998, ''Relix'' celebrated its 25th anniversary. Brown, in the editorial for the closing issue of 1998, marveled at ''Relix''{{'}}s survival and her tenure. She writes, \"For many years, I thought that once I completed the last issue of our 25th year, it might be a good time to move on and find myself a new adventure. I never realized the existing adventure would still be fresh and exciting and that the party would go on for so long.\" She stayed on as editor of the magazine for the next few years.\n\nIn August 2000, Kippel and Brown decided they were ready for a new direction and sold the magazine to Wall Street executive Steve Bernstein.<ref name=\"MediaLife\"/>  With that change also came new editor (Aeve Baldwin), art director, marketing and advertising departments. The office was also moved from Brooklyn to Manhattan. The new team prepped readers for a new ''Relix'' in the February 2001 issue explaining that the April issue would have an entirely new design and also some content changes. Baldwin originally joined the ''Relix'' team when Bernstein persuaded her to take the position when he bought the magazine. She and Bernstein had met in Japan where he had worked for several years and, on the side for fun, was one of her writers at Tokyo Classified, an English-language magazine based in Tokyo where she was the editor). Josh Baron, previously the executive editor who had been with the company since 2001, took over as editor-in-chief<ref name=\"FolioMagazine\"/> in 2007. In 2001, Relix also purchased Jambands.com,<ref name=\"MediaLife\"/> a daily news website devoted to improvisational music founded by [[Dean Budnick]] in 1998 that helped popularize the term 'jamband'. In 2007, ''Relix''{{'}}s 190-issue archive entered the vault in the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum]] in Cleveland.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/03/15/relix_magazine_enters_rock_and_roll_hall | title=Relix Magazine Enters Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Vaults | publisher=Starpulse.com | date=March 15, 2007 | accessdate=December 10, 2012}}</ref>\n\nUnder Bernstein's leadership, ''Relix'' served as the basis of [[Zenbu Media]] Group, which included productions such as The Jammys, The Green Apple Music and Arts Festival, world music magazine [[Global Rhythm]] and heavy metal magazines, [[Metal Edge]]<ref name=\"FolioMagazine\"/> and [[Metal Maniacs]].<ref name=\"FolioMagazine\"/> In February 2009, Bernstein folded Zenbu Media due to financial difficulties. The entire staff of all four magazines was let go. As ''Relix'' went to print with what was likely its last issue (April/May 2009), a group of the magazine's employees along with [[Peter Shapiro (concert promoter)|Peter Shapiro]] created Relix Media Group (LLC)<ref>{{cite magazine | url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/news/e3ifb8c14aa44b92177bc3aad298999e935 | title=Business Briefs: Qtrax, Relix, Jimmy Eat World | magazine=Billboard Magazine | date=May 4, 2009 | accessdate=December 10, 2012 | author=Peoples, Glenn}}</ref> and bought the Relix and Jambands.com from Bernstein.<ref name=\"FolioMagazine\"/> Shapiro had previously owned jamband-oriented club [[Wetlands]] in New York City,<ref name=\"FolioMagazine\"/> produced concert films such as ''I Love All Access'' and ''[[U2 3D]]'', the first live action film brought to big screen movie theaters. Shapiro currently owns Brooklyn Bowl in Williamsburg, a bowling alley, concert venue and restaurant as well as Brooklyn Bowl London, Brooklyn Bowl Las Vegas and the Capitol Theatre in Port Chester, NY.\n\nThe group included Baron, the editorial team of [[Dean Budnick]] and Mike Greenhaus, advertising team of Rachel Seiden and Cole Boyle along with Shapiro. ''Relix'' releases eight issues a year, each with a compilation CD inside featuring artists from that particular issue and up-and-coming bands. Since 2009, Relix Media group has co-founded doNYC, a New York-area event database, with partners [[DoStuff Network|DoStuff Media]] and Bowery Presents, and started the Hear & There advertising network. In 2013, Baron stepped down as Editor, leaving  Budnick and Greenhaus to assume the role of Editor-in-Chief. Relix spent much of 2013 counting down to its 40th anniversary. As part of the magazine's anniversary campaign, artists core to the magazine's history\u2014including The Who, Dave Matthews Band, Warren Haynes, Phil Lesh, Widespread Panic, Jack Johnson and Kings of Leon\u2014received cover profiles. The magazine also launched the Relix 40 list, compiling the best books, live albums, guitar solos and jams since Relix's first issue.\n\nRecent cover artists include: Gary Clark Jr., a tribute to the Grateful Dead's 50th anniversary, My Morning Jacket, Punch Brothers, Robert Plant and Phish.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n* {{cite news | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1996-08-18/news/18017443_1_grateful-dead-relix-jerry-garcia | title=Dead Live As Relix | newspaper=NY Daily News | date=August 18, 1996 | accessdate=December 10, 2012 | author=Saltonstall, Dave}}\n* {{cite news | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI%7CDN&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB29D2DD6AF99C7&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=It's a business that feeds off the dead: Relix Magazine celebrates the band | newspaper=Philadelphia Daily News | date=March 12, 1990 | accessdate=December 10, 2012}} {{Paywall}}\n* {{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72152827.html?dids=72152827:72152827&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+01%2C+1993&author=Richard+Harrington&pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=For+Those+True+Blue+Believers%3B+Fanzines+on+Elvis%2C+Dylan%2C+The+Dead+and+the+Boss&pqatl=google | title=For Those True Blue Believers; Fanzines on Elvis, Dylan, The Dead and the Boss | newspaper=The Washington Post | date=June 1, 1993 | accessdate=December 10, 2012 | author=Harrington, Richard}} {{Paywall}}\n* {{cite web | url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAD9052C59863DD&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=Grateful Dead spins more than just songs with retail offerings | publisher=Austin America-Statesman | date=November 27, 1992 | accessdate=December 10, 2012}} {{Paywall}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.relix.com Official website]\n\n[[Category:American music magazines]]\n[[Category:Grateful Dead]]\n[[Category:Magazines established in 1974]]\n[[Category:American eight times annually magazines]]\n[[Category:Magazines published in New York City]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=September 2010}}\n{{Infobox magazine\n| title           = Relix\n| logo            = Relix-logo.png\n| logo_size       = 250px\n| image_file      = <!-- cover.jpg (omit the \"file: prefix -->\n| image_size      = <!-- (defaults to user thumbnail size if no size is stated) -->\n| image_alt       = \n| image_caption   = \n| editor          = Dean Budnick and Mike Greenhaus\n| editor_title    = \n| previous_editor = \n| staff_writer    = \n| photographer    = \n| category        = [[music magazine]]\n| frequency       = 8 per year\n| circulation     = \n| publisher       = \n| founder         = \n| founded         = \n| firstdate       = {{Start date|1974|September}} \n| company         = Relix Media Group \n| country         = [[United States]]\n| based           = [[New York City]]\n| language        = English\n| website         = {{URL|http://www.relix.com}} \n| issn            = 0146-3489\n| oclc            = \n}}\n\n'''''Relix''''' is a magazine that focuses on live and improvisational music.  The magazine was launched in 1974 as a handmade newsletter<ref name=\"FolioMagazine\">{{cite web|url=http://www.foliomag.com/2009/relix-returns-dead|title=Relix Returns from the Dead|work=Folio Magazine|date=May 3, 2009|accessdate=December 10, 2012|author=Stableford, Dylan}}</ref> devoted to connecting people who recorded [[Grateful Dead]] concerts. It rapidly expanded into a music magazine covering a wide number of artists.<ref name=\"MediaLife\">{{cite web| url=http://www.medialifemagazine.com:8080/news2002/feb02/feb11/1_mon/news3monday.html | title=Relix, for lovers of jam music|work=Media Life Magazine|date=February 11, 2002|accessdate=December 10, 2012|author=Bercovici, Jeff}}</ref> It is the second-longest continuously published music magazine in the United States after ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. The magazine is published eight times a year.<ref>{{cite web|title=Potential Markets|url=http://www.freelancewriting.com/magazinewriting/write-for-music-magazines.php|publisher=Freelance Writing|accessdate=December 4, 2015}}</ref> The magazine has a circulation of 102,000.<ref name=\"FolioMagazine\"/>\n\n== Origins ==\nLes Kippel was the founder of the First Free Underground Grateful Dead Tape Exchange in 1971  that recorded  and traded live Grateful Dead concert tapes for free. As the popularity of trading live concerts on tape increased, a practice the Grateful Dead allowed and ultimately encouraged, Kippel realized that he needed to get a more streamlined method of getting tapers together to trade.  He started a newsletter to help his fellow tape-traders connect rather than all of them having to go through him.  He and friend Jim McGurn came up with the name ''Dead Relix'' because each Dead tape, for them, was a relic. Jerry Moore became the editor-in-chief of Dead Relix, a relatively small magazine dedicated to taping and tape collecting the Grateful and bands of a similar ilk. The first issue was released in September 1974 with an initial print run of 200.  Kippel allowed a friend, who taught printing in a high school printing shop  to 'use' Dead Relix to teach printing to the students.\n\nThe first issue featured a black and white drawing of a large skull in the center with a horned, winged creature below it and marijuana leaves sprouting around it. On the upper left it says: \"Dedicated to the memory of the world's sneakiest tape collector-[[Richard Nixon|Tricky Dicky]].\"  The issue cost $1.25. With only 50 initial subscribers, Kippel printed 200 copies.  However, once word spread of the magazine, subscriptions rose quickly. The first issue was released shortly after the Grateful Dead announced a hiatus. The timing was auspicious as ''Dead Relix'' now became the only way for Deadheads, who frequently only saw each other on tour with the band, to stay in touch and up-to-date with band and its members' happenings. The group's hiatus also created the opportunity for ''Dead Relix'' to broaden its coverage as it came to include other Dead-esque bands on the San Francisco scene like [[New Riders of the Purple Sage]], [[Commander Cody and His Lost Planet Airmen|Commander Cody]] and [[Hot Tuna]].\n\n== Transitions ==\nAt the end of 1978, ''Relix'' underwent a major transition that propelled it from more of a newsletter to a true magazine.  The change started with a new editor.  Jerry Moore left the magazine and Jeff Tamarkin replaced him.  Tamarkin had bigger plans for ''Relix''.  He felt it needed to branch out and he wanted to broaden the coverage to include more different types of music\u2014punk, metal, new wave, even pop. Kippel gave him free rein to expand as he wanted.  Dead was dropped from the title and the subject matter changed dramatically.<ref name=\"Chronicling\">{{cite news | url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/103491927.html?dids=103491927:103491927&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Oct+05%2C+1989&author=By+John+Anderson&pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&desc=CHRONICLING+%60BAY+ROCK%27+-+THE+SAN+FRANCISCO+KIND+Their+Subscribers+Are%2C+Uh%2C+Grateful&pqatl=google | title=Chronicling 'Bay Rock' - The San Francisco Kind: Their Subscribers Are, Uh, Grateful | newspaper=Newsday | date=October 5, 1989 | accessdate=December 10, 2012 | author=Anderson, John}} {{Paywall}}</ref> The result was a greater readership and many angry Deadheads.  Kippel attempted to appease the worries of ''Relix''{{'}}s longtime supporters in a letter from the publisher in the Jan/Feb 1979 issue. He wrote:\n\n{{Cquote|The key to all this is that as people who live for and by music, we should see and listen to other music, and that is the purpose and function of RELIX: to be the eyes and ears for our readers, and to report back and show and tell you, our readers what's going on around the music scene WITH AN OPEN MIND and we at RELIX do hope that you, our readers, will have an open mind for music.}}\n\nIn 1979, the [[Blues Brothers]], [[The Who]], and even [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] appeared on the cover. However, the Grateful Dead were never too far removed from ''Relix'' as pictures and interviews with the Dead still appeared in the magazine just with less frequency.\nTamarkin's tenure with ''Relix'' was brief, lasting only two years (today, he remains a contributing editor). His replacement was Toni Brown. While Brown appreciated Tamarkin's adjustments to the magazine, she recognized that ''Relix'' was straying from its Deadhead roots.  Her first act was to put \"Dead\" back into the title although it appeared in small print above the \"R\" in ''Relix''. Brown, who married Kippel in 1980, took his job as publisher and assumed full responsibility over the future of the magazine.\n\nWhen the Grateful Dead released ''[[In the Dark (Grateful Dead album)|In the Dark]]'' in 1987, the band\u2019s popularity grew exponentially with the help of radio airplay and \"Touch of Grey\" becoming the group's first song to chart. It played sold-out stadiums. The media became more involved with the Grateful Dead scene as did the police and the government's Drug Enforcement Administration. Deadheads were targeted for drug use and gained something of a negative reputation. ''Relix'' recognized the profiling and tried to educate Deadheads about how to avoid the police and what to bring (and not bring) with you to shows.\n\n== Merchandise and record company ==\nTo keep the magazine profitable, Kippel began dealing an array of collectibles geared towards ''Relix'' readers. This prompted him to create a merchandising divisions of the ''Relix'' company called Rockin' Relix/<ref name=\"Chronicling\"/> Relix International.  This led to many ties in the music merchandise world and Kippel gained connections all over the music scene. Kippel started a record company which he called [[Relix Records]]<ref name=\"Chronicling\"/> in 1980, after prompting to do so from Grateful Dead lyricist, [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]]. Now, the ''Relix'' corporation was flourishing. ''Relix'' kept close ties with the record stores that were buying their magazines, merchandise, and now, the albums of the artists it represented. ''Relix'' records existed for 20 years and released over 120 records including many magazine favorites, such as [[Jorma Kaukonen]], Hot Tuna, [[Free Grass Union]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.relix.com/relix/issues/2010/07/26/august|title=Relix - Issues - August|date=2010-07-26|work=Relix|accessdate=24 July 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809203807/http://www.relix.com/relix/issues/2010/07/26/august|archivedate=9 August 2011}}</ref> the New Riders of the Purple Sage, [[Wavy Gravy]], Commander Cody and many more. Brown also created a forum in the magazine for readers to correspond with incarcerated Deadheads, many who were convicted of non-violent drug offences.\n\n== Phish and Relix ==\nIn October 1989, ''Relix'' covered the band [[Phish]]. Mick Skidmore heard an unreleased copy of [[Junta (album)|Junta]] and decided to write a review. He closed the piece with, \"I hope we get a chance to hear more from these extremely talented musicians in the not too distant future. Meanwhile, this tape comes highly recommended.\" Phish is now one of the most popular bands in the country and frequently appears in the magazine's pages.\n\n== Relix after Jerry Garcia's death ==\nFollowing [[Jerry Garcia]]'s death on August 9, 1995, ''Relix'' was once again the focus of media attention. ''Relix'' put a close up picture of Garcia on the cover which was used by media outlets all over the country. Publisher Toni Brown remembers, \"Wherever I looked, ''Relix'' was there. I admit that it bolstered sales to heights we'd never seen, but I would have preferred to have Jerry back.\" People looked to ''Relix'' for how to cope with the loss of Garcia, the band and its constant tours, tours that were for many provided their livelihood in selling handmade/homemade merchandise and food.\n\n''Relix'' began focusing on a wider of array of bands including [[Dave Matthews Band]], [[Phish]], [[Widespread Panic]], [[Blues Traveler]], [[Free Grass Union]], [[The String Cheese Incident]], [[moe.]], [[The Disco Biscuits]], [[Leftover Salmon]], [[God Street Wine]] and [[Strangefolk]]. In 1998, ''Relix'' celebrated its 25th anniversary. Brown, in the editorial for the closing issue of 1998, marveled at ''Relix''{{'}}s survival and her tenure. She writes, \"For many years, I thought that once I completed the last issue of our 25th year, it might be a good time to move on and find myself a new adventure.

He last competed part-time in the [[NASCAR Camping World Truck Series]] and the [[ARCA Racing Series]].\n\n==Racing career==\n\n===NASCAR Camping World Truck Series===\nKaltreider began his [[NASCAR]] career in 2018, driving the No. 50 Chevrolet Silverado for Beaver Motorsports at [[Chicagoland Speedway|Chicagoland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nascar.nbcsports.com/2018/06/28/truck-practice-report-at-chicagoland/|title=Truck practice report at Chicagoland\n|last=Beaver|first=Dan|date=June 28, 2018|access-date=November 16, 2018}}</ref> He finished 25th after starting 30th.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-truck/news/moffitt-earns-much-needed-win-in-las-lap-pass-at-chicagoland-1053553/3131900/?nrt=126|title=Moffitt earns much-needed win in last-lap pass at Chicagoland\n|last=Southers|first=Tim|date=June 30, 2018|access-date=November 16, 2018\n}}</ref>\n\n===ARCA Racing Series===\nKaltreider first started racing in 2001, where he drove the No. 36 Ford for his own team at [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]], though failed to finish due to clutch problems. He kept racing on a part-time schedule throughout the years, normally at Pocono. On December 25, 2018, most of Kaltreider's equipment was destroyed in a shop fire. His cars were being updated for the [[2019 ARCA Menards Series]] season (one by [[GMS Racing]]) but none of the losses were covered by insurance and only one legacy car was left.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Koelle |first1=Christian |title=Christmas Day Fire Destroys ARCA Owner/Driver Brain Kaltreider's Race Shop |url=https://www.frontstretch.com/2019/01/01/christmas-day-fire-destroys-arca-racing-series-owner-driver-brian-kaltreiders-race-shop/ |website=Frontstretch |accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===NASCAR===\n([[Template:NASCAR driver results legend|key]]) (<span style=\"font-size:85%\">'''Bold'''&nbsp;\u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.
