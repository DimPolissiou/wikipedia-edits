It took some time before the Finns Party gained ground in Finnish elections and the party's sole MP until 2003 was Vistbacka. In 2003, the party won three seats: besides Vistbacka, Soini and [[Tony Halme]] were elected. Soini had taken over as the chairman in 1997 and remained in the position for twenty years until 2017. The party slowly gained ground, but ultimately saw exceptional rise in 2011 election, when the party gained 39 seats, making them the third largest party in the parliament and the leading opposition party. In the 2015 election, the Finns Party rose to be the second biggest party in the parliament with 38 seats. The Finns Party subsequently entered into a coalition government with the Centre Party and the [[National Coalition Party]], led by Prime Minister [[Juha Sipil\u00e4]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/president_appoints_new_cabinet/8027680|title=President appoints new cabinet|date=29 May 2015|website= yle.fi|publisher=Yle|accessdate= 16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2017, Soini announced that he would step down as party chairman in the next party congress.<ref>[http://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/soini_announces_he_will_not_continue_at_finns_party_helm/9492639 Soini announces he will not continue at Finns Party helm] Yle News on March 5, 2017.

In the 2015 election, the Finns Party rose to be the second biggest party in the parliament with 38 seats.

He imagined that someday \"rational medical therapy\" would consist of manipulation of the musculoskeletal system, surgery, and very sparingly used drugs. He invented the name \"osteopathy\" by blending two Greek roots ''osteon-'' for bone and ''-pathos'' for suffering in order to communicate his [[theory]] that disease and physiologic dysfunction were [[Etiology|etiologically]] grounded in a disordered musculoskeletal system. Thus, by diagnosing and treating the musculoskeletal system, he believed that physicians could treat a variety of diseases and spare patients the negative side-effects of drugs.\n\n[[Image:Twain1909.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mark Twain was a vocal supporter of the early osteopathic movement.]]The new profession faced stiff opposition from the medical establishment at the time.

The acknowledgment draws a clear separation between American DOs, who are medical doctors, and non-physician osteopaths trained outside of the United States. Within the international standards that classify jobs to promote international comparability across occupations, U.S.-trained DOs are now categorized with all other physicians as medical doctors. This event took place in June 2018 and started a relay of events and opened doors for DO's as more countries started to understand and give full recognition to US trained medical doctors with the D.O. degree, e.g. the Association of Medical Councils of Africa (AMCOA) approved a resolution in 2019 granting the AOA's request that AMCOA recognize U.S.-trained DOs as fully licensed physicians with practice rights equivalent to MDs, opening its 20 member countries, which include Botswana, Gambia, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Nigeria, Rwanda, Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa, South Sudan, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe to DO's.\n\n===Osteopathic medicine and primary care===\n[[Image:OsteoPrimaryCare.PNG|thumb|400px|Trends in primary care as a career choice of osteopathic medical students<ref name=\"Singer\">Singer, Allen M.

Osteopathic medical schools can keep the cost of student body expansion relatively low compared with that of MD institutions.

He imagined that someday \"rational medical therapy\" would consist of manipulation of the musculoskeletal system, surgery, and very sparingly used drugs. He invented the name \"osteopathy\" by blending two Greek roots ''osteon-'' for bone and ''-pathos'' for suffering in order to communicate his [[theory]] that disease and physiologic dysfunction were [[Etiology|etiologically]] grounded in a disordered musculoskeletal system. Thus, by diagnosing and treating the musculoskeletal system, he believed that physicians could treat a variety of diseases and spare patients the negative side-effects of drugs.\n\n[[Image:Twain1909.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mark Twain was a vocal supporter of the early osteopathic movement.]]The new profession faced stiff opposition from the medical establishment at the time.

While osteopathic leaders emphasize osteopaths' unique identity, many osteopaths would rather not draw attention to their uniqueness.<ref name=ACP />}}\n\nThe rapid expansion has raised concerns about the number of available faculty at osteopathic schools and the role that those faculty play in maintaining the integrity of the academic program of the schools.  [[Norman Gevitz]], author of the leading text on the history of osteopathic medicine, recently published,\n\n{{quote|DO schools are currently expanding their class sizes much more quickly than are their MD counterparts. Unlike MD colleges, where it is widely known that academic faculty members\u2014fearing dilution of quality as well as the prospect of an increased teaching workload\u2014constitute a powerful inhibiting force to expand the class size, osteopathic faculty at private osteopathic schools have traditionally had little or no input on such matters. Instead, these decisions are almost exclusively the responsibility of college administrators and their boards of trustees, who look at such expansion from an entrepreneurial as well as an educational perspective. Osteopathic medical schools can keep the cost of student body expansion relatively low compared with that of MD institutions. Although the standards of the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation ensure that there will be enough desks and lab spaces to accommodate all new students, they do not mandate that an osteopathic college must bear the expense of maintaining a high full-time-faculty:student ratio.<ref name=\"faculty\">{{cite journal |author=Gevitz N |title=The transformation of osteopathic medical education |journal=Acad Med |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=701\u20136 |date=2009 |pmid=19474540 |doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e3181a4049e }}</ref>}}\n\nThe president of the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine commented on the current climate of crisis within the profession.  {{quote|The simultaneous movement away from osteopathic medicine\u2019s traditionally separate training and practice systems, when coupled with its rapid growth, has created a sense of crisis as to its future.

It is closely related to the drug [[prodine]], the only difference being that meprodine has an [[ethyl group]] rather than a [[methyl]] at the 3-position of the [[piperidine]] ring.\n\nAs with prodine, there are two [[isomer]]s of meprodine, alpha-meprodine and beta-meprodine, with the alpha isomer having been more widely used.  Alphameprodine (ACSCN 9604) and betameprodine (ACSCN 9608) are both Schedule I Narcotic controlled substances in the United States, both with annual aggregate manufacturing quotas of 2 grammes as of 2014.<ref>http://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/quotas/2014/fr0825.htm</ref>\n\nMeprodine has similar effects to other opioids, and produces analgesia, sedation and euphoria. Side effects can include [[itching]], [[nausea]] and potentially serious [[respiratory depression]] which can be life-threatening.\n\n==Legal Status==\n\n===Australia===\nMeprodine is considered a Schedule 9 prohibited substance in Australia under the [[Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons|Poisons Standard]] (February 2017).<ref name=\"Poisons Standard\">Poisons Standard October 2015 https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2017L00057</ref> A Schedule 9 substance is a substance which may be abused or misused, the manufacture, possession, sale or use of which should be prohibited by law except when required for medical or scientific research, or for analytical, teaching or training purposes with approval of Commonwealth and/or State or Territory Health Authorities.<ref name=\"Poisons Standard\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Opioidergics}}\n\n[[Category:Synthetic opioids]]\n[[Category:Propionate esters]]\n[[Category:Piperidines]]\n[[Category:Mu-opioid agonists]]\n\n\n{{analgesic-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Fswitzer4", "label": "safe", "comment": "added FDA UNII to drug box", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meprodine"}
