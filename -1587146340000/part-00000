The team's current head football coach is [[Tyson Helton]]. The Hilltoppers play their home games at [[Houchens Industries\u2013L. T. Smith Stadium]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].<ref>[https://wkusports.com/documents/2019/7/17/2019_WKU_Football_Media_Guide.pdf WKU Football Media Guide retrieved 31 March 2020.]</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n=== Early history (1908\u20131947) ===\n\n====L.T. Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|first team]] set a school record for wins that would stand for 41 years and his [[1928 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|last team]] claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In [[1930 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1930]], James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in [[1932 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1932]] seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the [[1937 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1937]] season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By [[1952 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1952]], with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship, tied the [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|school record]] for wins, and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit.

Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up?

The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]].

Smith and World War I (1908\u20131921)====\nWestern Kentucky first fielded a football team in 1908 but did not start playing sanctioned games until the 1913 season. M.A. Leiper and Roy Manchester are the first noted coaches for WKU. The two men teamed up to coach the Hilltoppers for their inaugural season which solely consisted of a 20\u20130 win over Elizabethtown. J.L. Arthur then took over the program for three years from 1914 to 1916, coaching a total of 14 games, 6 of which were against [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|Eastern Kentucky]]. From 1917 to 1919 the Hilltoppers didn't compete in football from due to World War I. In 1920, L. T. Smith, whose name bears the Hilltoppers' home stadium, took the reins and coached the team for two seasons.\n\n====Edgar Diddle (1922\u20131928)====\nFrom 1922 to 1928, the Hilltoppers saw their first success as Coach [[Edgar Diddle|E.A. Diddle]] took over the football program for seven seasons leading them to four winning seasons while also coaching the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|WKU Hilltoppers basketball team]]. Diddle, who was a dual-athlete himself, encouraged his players to participate in multiple sports so they could stay in shape. His [[1922 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|first team]] set a school record for wins that would stand for 41 years and his [[1928 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|last team]] claimed to be state champions.<ref name=\"Ruby\">{{cite book| last = Ruby| first = Earl| title = Red Towel Territory : A History of Athletics at Western Kentucky University| publisher = American National Bank and Trust Co.| year = 1979|}}</ref>  When he retired from coaching football in 1928, Diddle posted a record of 38\u201324\u20132. The Hilltoppers outscored opponents 171\u20137 in Diddle's final year of coaching the program.\n\n====Carl Anderson (1929\u20131937)====\nAfter Diddle left the football program to focus on coaching basketball, WKU football went through a series of instability in coaching but also a series of 9 winning seasons. In 1929, [[Carl Anderson (American football)|Carl \"Swede\" Anderson]] took over as head coach leading the Hilltoppers to a 7\u20133 record before leaving to take the head coach job over the [[Kansas State Wildcats football|Kansas State]] freshman football team. In [[1930 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1930]], James Elam led the Hilltoppers to a 16\u20135\u20131 record during his two seasons. Ernie Miller then took over in [[1932 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1932]] seasons going 7\u20131 during his lone season before Jesse Thomas took over for the 1933 season going 6\u20132. In 1934, Carl Anderson returned for a second stint with the Hilltoppers where he served as head coach through the [[1937 Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football team|1937]] season posting a 24\u20139\u20133 record with wins over EKU in all four seasons. The Hilltoppers were very successful in this era posting an outstanding a 60\u201320\u20134 record.\n\n====Gander Terry and World War II (1938\u20131947)====\nAfter Anderson left the hill once again, this time to be an assistant coach at [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]], the Hilltoppers selected \"[[Gander Terry]] to lead the program. In their four seasons under Terry, the Hilltoppers went 25\u20139\u20133 beating rivals [[Middle Tennessee Blue Raiders football|[Middle Tennessee]] and Eastern Kentucky in every game they played. Terry left the program after the 1941 season following a 4\u20135\u20131 record, the Hilltopper's first losing season since 1925. Arnold Winkenhofer took over in 1942 coaching the Toppers for one season before the program was stopped from 1943 to 1945 due to World War II. In 1946, Jesse Thomas returned to the Hill for his second stint as head coach. Thomas only stuck around WKU two more seasons with much less success than his first go around posting a 5\u201310\u20132 record.\n\n=== The Jimmy Feix era (1948\u20131988) ===\n\n====Jack Clayton (1948\u20131956)====\n[[Jack Clayton (American football)|Jack Clayton]] provided some much-needed stability to the WKU football program where he served as head coach for 9 seasons. In 1949, after losing the first two games to start the season, Clayton started a freshman quarterback by the name of [[Jimmy Feix]] winning 5 of the last 7 games that season. By 1952, with Feix now in his senior year, Clayton coached WKU to their first [[Ohio Valley Conference]] championship and the school's first bowl appearance, winning 34\u201319 over [[Arkansas State Red Wolves football|Arkansas State]] in the [[Refrigerator Bowl]], finishing the season 9\u20131. Feix became the first WKU football athlete ever to earn All-America honors after posting the highest pass completion percentage in the nation (.612). Under Clayton, the Hilltoppers posted a record of 50\u201333\u20132 before he left to coach at [[Northwestern State Demons football|Northwestern Louisiana State College]], his alma mater.\n\n====Nick Denes (1957\u20131967)====\n[[Nick Denes]], who was also a [[WKU Hilltoppers baseball]] head coach and for who, [[Nick Denes Field]] is named, coached WKU football for 11 seasons. In his time on the Hill, Denes compiled a 57\u201339\u20137 record for a .587 winning percentage. In 1963, Denes led the Hilltoppers to their second bowl game victory, defeating Coast Guard 27\u20130 in the [[Tangerine Bowl (1947\u20131982)|Tangerine Bowl]], a season where the Hilltoppers went 10\u20130\u20131. Denes retired after the 1967 season following a 42\u201319 win over [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]].\n\n====Jimmy Feix and NCAA Division I-AA transition (1968\u20131983)====\nAfter serving under Nick Denes as an assistant coach for all 11 seasons, [[Jimmy Feix]] was promoted to head coach. In his 16 seasons at the helm, Feix compiled an impressive 105\u201356\u20136 record (.6488). His 14 teams that competed in the [[Ohio Valley Conference]] went 67\u201328\u20132 (.701) in conference play. The Hilltoppers won six Ohio Valley Conference championships between 1970 and 1980. Feix became the most successful and longest-tenured coach in Western Kentucky football history while leading the Hilltoppers in a transition from [[NCAA Division II]] to [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|NCAA Division I-AA]] (now FCS).\n\nIn 1973, the Hilltoppers went undefeated in the regular season before competing in the first-year NCAA Division II championship playoffs. They made it to the championship game against [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] coming up just short and finishing the season 12\u20131. In 1975, the Hilltoppers made the playoff field again advancing to the title game for the second time, but once again having to settle for runner-up honors finishing their season with an 11\u20132 record.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/26709537/wku-coaching-legend-jimmy-feix-dies|title=WKU coaching legend Jimmy Feix dies|last=Lewis|first=John|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref>\n\nFeix was named OVC Coach of the Year in 1973, 1978 and 1980 and remains the winningest football coach in WKU history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://alumni.wku.edu/s/808/index.aspx?pgid=1777&gid=1|title=WKU Alumni Association \u2013 Mr. Jimmy Feix|website=alumni.wku.edu|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> Feix coached 16 athletes who followed him on the list of WKU football All-Americans.\n\n====Dave Roberts (1983\u20131988)====\nFeix retired as head coach moving to work in Alumni Affairs for two years before taking over as Director of Athletics in 1986. In his vacancy, the Hilltoppers hired former [[Vanderbilt Commodores football|Vanderbilt]] assistant [[Dave Roberts (American football)|Dave Roberts]] to be the head coach with hopes of continuing what Feix started. Roberts struggled through his first three seasons posting a record 10\u201322\u20131 before turning things around. In 1987 and 1988 Roberts took the Hilltoppers to the [[NCAA Division I-AA playoffs]] coming up short to rival EKU both years. After the 1988 season, Roberts left Western Kentucky for the [[Louisiana\u2013Monroe Warhawks football|Northeast Louisiana]] head coaching job. Though going 16\u20138 in his last two season, Roberts left with a 26\u201330\u20131 record becoming the first Hilltopper coach to leave with a losing record in over 60 years.\n\n=== The Jack Harbaugh era and FBS transition (1989\u20132009) ===\n\n==== Jack Harbaugh (1989\u20132002) ====\n[[Jack Harbaugh]] served as the Hilltoppers head football coach for 14 seasons, compiling a 91\u201368 record, three 10+ win seasons, two conference championships (OVC 2000, Gateway 2002) and the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA National Championship]]. Harbaugh took the Hilltopper football program from the depths of despair in the early 1990s to its best stretch since the legendary [[Jimmy Feix]] coached on the Hill.\n\nIn 1992, WKU was on the verge of losing its football program after a state-mandated $6.1 million budget cut. Harbaugh was notified of the plans to shut down the program just before spring practice was about to begin. Having already made up his mind that he was not going to quit, he talked with his players left them a choice: accept defeat and leave, or fight to stay. Now known as the 1992 \"Save the Program\" team, every player decided to stay, fight, and work to save WKU football. While Harbaugh and the team did their part, former WKU quarterback, coach and athletics director at the time, Jimmy Feix, started an emergency fundraising campaign writing letters and making calls to former WKU players, urging them to buy season tickets. All the efforts paid off and on April 30, 1992, the WKU Board of Regents voted to allow football to stay but with a reduced budget.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wkuherald.com/sports/football/wku-program-savers-re-unite-on-saturday/article_cb65a9f8-0395-11e2-9bca-001a4bcf6878.html|title=WKU 'Program Savers' re-unite on Saturday|last=Stephens|first=Brad|newspaper=College Heights Herald|access-date=2016-12-14}}</ref> The Hilltoppers finished the 1992 season with a losing record of 4\u20136. As the budget remained tight over the next few years WKU managed an 8-3 record in 1993 before having back-to-back losing seasons.\n\nNo one ever doubted Harbaugh's ability to coach but he clearly needed better players. In 1994, with unwavering faith in their father, both of his sons, [[Jim Harbaugh]] and [[John Harbaugh]], decided to help however they could. While still playing in the NFL, Jim joined the WKU football coaching staff as an NCAA-certified unpaid assistant which allowed him to recruit.

Elson's first four seasons as head coach were at the [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA]] level (now FCS) where he picked up where Harbaugh left and posted four straight winning seasons, a record of 30\u201317, and two playoff berths. On Nov. 2nd, 2006, prior to the end of the season, WKU's Board of Regents voted in favor of moving from NCAA Division I-AA to [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I-A]] football (now FBS) and would be joining the [[Sun Belt Conference]] in all sports by 2009. The move allowed WKU to add 22 scholarships by 2009 and increase the overall football budget by an estimated $2.5 million by the time the transition was complete.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wkusports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/110206aaa.html|title=Board Of Regents Votes To Elevate Western Kentucky Football To Division I-A Status|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2007, the Hilltoppers began the transition to NCAA Division I FBS as Independents, considered a reclassifying school for both the 2007 and 2008 seasons due to NCAA rules. The Hilltoppers were not eligible to participate in a Sun Belt Conference Championship or a berth in a bowl game until the 2009 season. Knowing it wasn't going to be easy, and without the motivation of being eligible to compete for a championship, Elson and the Hilltoppers set two team goals that season; to win seven games and to go undefeated at home. Both goals required at least one win over an FBS team. If the Hilltoppers won seven games, they got rings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=2647510|title=Moving up?

The 2008 season shed a truer light to the transition as the Hilltoppers went 2\u201310 with no wins over FBS opponents, only beating their two other long-time rivals and FCS-level opponents [[Eastern Kentucky Colonels football|EKU]] and [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]]. Things only got worse for the Hilltoppers in 2009 after they finally became full members of the Sun Belt Conference. WKU lost every game that season, going 0\u201312, posting their worst record in school history. Elson was hopeful to survive the transition as he asked for patience in building the program, but on Nov. 9th, 2009, prior to the end of the season, athletic director, Wood Selig had enough and fired Elson.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/news/story?id=4637342|title=Western Kentucky fires coach amid 0-9 season|date=2009-11-09|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref> The Hilltoppers went 39\u201344 under Elson, going 9\u201327 in his final three seasons (1\u201326 against FBS opponents).\n\n=== The FBS era (2010\u2013present) ===\n\n====Willie Taggart (2010\u20132012)====\nWKU Quarterback Legend, [[Willie Taggart]], returned to his alma mater as head football coach in 2010 after leaving his position as [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]] running backs coach, where he served under [[Jack Harbaugh]]'s son [[Jim Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/college/football/sunbelt/2009-11-23-western-kentucky-taggart_N.htm|title=Western Kentucky hires Stanford assistant Willie Taggart as coach \u2013 USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}</ref> In their first year under Taggart, coming off a winless season under Elson, WKU finally broke their 26-game losing streak with a 54\u201321 win at [[Louisiana-Lafayette]].

That was Western Kentucky's first win over a [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] opponent in program history.
