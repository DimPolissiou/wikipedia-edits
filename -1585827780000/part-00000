{"title_page": "History of silk", "text_new": "[[Image:Court ladies pounding silk from a painting (\u6363\u7ec3\u56fe) by Emperor Huizong.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[Court Ladies Preparing Newly Woven Silk]]'', a [[Chinese painting|Chinese]] [[silk painting]] by [[Emperor Huizong of Song]], early 12th century]] \nThe production of [[silk]] originates in [[China]] in the [[Neolithic]] ([[Yangshao culture]], 4th millennium BC). Silk remained confined to China until the [[Silk Road]] opened at some point during the later half of the 1st millennium BC. China maintained its virtual [[monopoly]] over [[sericulture|silk production]] for another thousand years. Not confined to [[ancient Chinese clothing|clothing]], silk was also used for a number of other applications, including writing, and the color of silk worn was an important guide of [[social class]] during the [[Tang dynasty]].\n\nSilk cultivation spread to Japan around 300 AD, and, by 552 AD, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] managed to obtain [[silkworm]] eggs and were able to begin silkworm cultivation. The Arabs also began to manufacture silk at the same time. As a result of the spread of [[sericulture]], Chinese silk exports became less important, although they still maintained dominance over the [[luxury goods|luxury]] silk market. The [[Crusades]] brought silk production to Western Europe, in particular to many Italian states, which saw an economic boom exporting silk to the rest of Europe. Changes in manufacturing techniques also began to take place during the Middle Ages, with devices such as the [[spinning wheel]] first appearing. During the 16th century, France joined Italy in developing a successful silk trade, though the efforts of most other nations to develop a silk industry of their own were unsuccessful.\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] changed much of Europe's silk industry. Due to innovations on spinning [[cotton]], cotton became much cheaper to manufacture and therefore caused more expensive silk production to become less mainstream. New weaving technologies, however, increased the efficiency of production. Among these was the [[Jacquard loom]], developed for silk embroidery. An [[epidemic]] of several silkworm diseases caused production to fall, especially in France, where the industry never recovered. In the 20th century Japan and China regained their earlier role in silk production, and China is now once again the world's largest producer of silk. The rise of new fabrics such as [[nylon]] reduced the prevalence of silk throughout the world, and silk is now once again a rare luxury good, much less important than in its heyday.\n\n==Early history==\n[[Image:Bombyx mori Cocon 02.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The silkworm cocoon]]\n\n===First appearance of silk===\nThe earliest evidence of silk was found at the sites of [[Yangshao culture]] in [[Xia County]], [[Shanxi]], where a silk cocoon was found cut in half by a sharp knife, dating back to between 4000 and 3000 BC. The species was identified as ''[[Bombyx mori]]'', the domesticated silkworm. Fragments of primitive loom can also be seen from the sites of [[Hemudu culture]] in [[Yuyao|Yuyao, Zhejiang]], dated to about 4000 BC. The earliest example of silk fabric is from 3630 BC, and was used as wrapping for the body of a child. The fabric comes from a [[Yangshao culture|Yangshao]] site in Qingtaicun at Rongyang, [[Henan]].<ref name=silkculture>{{cite book |title=Chinese Silk: A Cultural History |last=Vainker |first=Shelagh |year=2004 |publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]] |location= |isbn=978-0813534466 |pages=20, 17}}</ref> Scraps of silk were found in a [[Liangzhu culture]] site at Qianshanyang in [[Huzhou|Huzhou, Zhejiang]], dating back to 2700 BC.<ref>Tang, Chi and Miao, Liangyun, [http://203.72.198.245/web/Content.asp?ID=27524&Query=1 \"Zhongguo Sichoushi\" (\"History of Silks in China\")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123095921/http://203.72.198.245/web/Content.asp?ID=27524&Query=1 |date=2007-11-23 }}.

Having observed the life of the silk worm on the recommendation of her husband, the [[Yellow Emperor]], she began to instruct her entourage in the art of raising silk worms, [[sericulture]]. From this point, the girl became the goddess of silk in [[Chinese mythology]]. Silk eventually left China via the heir of a princess who was promised to a prince of [[Khotan]]. This probably occurred in the early 1st century AD.<ref>Hill (2009), \"Appendix A: Introduction of Silk Cultivation to Khotan in the 1st Century AD.\", pp. 466-467.</ref> The princess, refusing to go without the fabric that she loved, would finally break the imperial ban on silk-worm exportation.\n\nThough silk was exported to foreign countries in great amounts, sericulture remained a secret that the Chinese carefully guarded. Consequently, other peoples invented wildly varying accounts of the source of the incredible fabric.\n\nIn [[classical antiquity]], most Romans, great admirers of the cloth, were convinced that the Chinese took the fabric from tree leaves.<ref>{{cite web | title = Les relations entre le monde romain et la Chine : la tentation du Far East | url = http://www.clio.fr/BIBLIOTHEQUE/les_relations_entre_le_monde_romain_et_la_chine__la_tentation_du_far_east.asp | author = Jean-No\u00ebl Robert | publisher = clio.fr | accessdate = May 6, 2007 | language = fr | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070522153024/http://www.clio.fr/BIBLIOTHEQUE/les_relations_entre_le_monde_romain_et_la_chine__la_tentation_du_far_east.asp | archivedate = May 22, 2007 | author-link = Jean-No\u00ebl Robert }}</ref> This belief was affirmed by [[Seneca the Elder]] in his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'' and by [[Virgil]] in his [[Georgics]].

Even though some saw the development of a luxury product as useless, silk provoked such a craze among high society that the rules in the ''[[Classic of Rites|Li Ji]]'' were used to limit its use to the members of the imperial family.<ref name=Meyer/> For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, because of its shimmering appearance. This appearance was due to silk's prism-like shape/structure, which refracted light from every angle. After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society, like the noble class and such. Silk began to be used for decorative means and also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, and bow making. Peasants did not have the right to wear silk until the Qing dynasty (1644\u20131911).<ref name=Meyer/>\n\n[[Paper]] was one of the [[Four Great Inventions|greatest discoveries of ancient China]].

Researchers have found an early example of writing done on silk paper in the tomb of a [[Marquess|marchioness]] who died around 168, in [[Mawangdui]], [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]].

It was used to pay government officials and compensate citizens who were particularly worthy. By the same token that one would sometimes estimate the price of products according to a certain weight of [[gold]], the length of the [[Economy of the Han Dynasty|silk cloth became a monetary standard in China]] (in addition to [[Ancient Chinese coinage|bronze coins]]). The wealth that silk brought to China stirred envy in neighboring peoples. Beginning in the 2nd century BC, the [[Xiongnu]] regularly pillaged the provinces of the Han Chinese for around 250 years. [[History of the Han Dynasty|Silk]] was a common offering by the emperor to these tribes in exchange for peace.\n\nSilk is described in a chapter of the ''[[Fan Shengzhi shu]]'' from the Western Han (206 BC \u2013 9 AD). There is a surviving calendar for silk production in an Eastern Han (25 \u2013 220 AD) document.

For example, the [[Tang Dynasty]]  and [[Song Dynasty]] imposed upon [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|bureaucrats]] the use of particular colors according to their functions in society. Under the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]], silk began to be used in a series of accessories: [[handkerchief]]s, wallets, belts, or even an embroidered piece of fabric displaying dozens of animals, real or mythical. These fashion accessories remained associated with a particular position: there was a specific [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]] for [[warrior]]s, for [[judge]]s, for [[nobles]], and others for religious use. The women of high Chinese society heeded codified practices and used silk in their garments to which they added countless motifs.<ref name=Meyer/> A 17th-century work, ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]'', gives a description of one such motif:\n\n{{quote|Golden lotus having a quilted backgammon pattern, double-folded, adorned with savage geese pecking at a landscape of flowers and roses; the dress' right figure had a floral border with buttons in the form of bees or chrysanthemums.<ref name=Meyer/>}}\n\n<gallery caption=\"Chinese silk making process\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"100px\">\n File:Women placing silkworms on trays together with mulberry leaves (Sericulture by Liang Kai, 1200s).jpg |The silkworms and mulberry leaves are placed on trays.\nFile:Men preparing twig frames where silkworms will spin cocoons (Sericulture by Liang Kai, 1200s).jpg|Twig frames for the silkworms are prepared.\nFile:Weighing and sorting the cocoons (Sericulture by Liang Kai, 1200s).jpg|The cocoons are weighed.\nFile:Soaking the cocoons and reeling the silk (Sericulture by Liang Kai, 1200s).jpg|The cocoons are soaked and the silk is wound on spools.\nFile:Weaving the silk (Sericulture by Liang Kai, 1200s).jpg|The silk is woven using a loom.\n</gallery>\n\n== Silk production in South Asia ==\nThe earliest examples of silk production outside China are from silk threads discovered from the [[Chanhudaro]] site in the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] which are dated to 2450\u20132000 BC.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Meadow|first=Richard|title=New Evidence for Early Silk in the Indus Civilization|url=https://www.academia.edu/27010012|journal=Archaeometry|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Good|first=I.

The monopoly was defended by an imperial decree, condemning to death anyone attempting to export silkworms or their eggs.

While [[wild silk]]s were produced in many countries, there is no doubt that the Chinese were the first to begin production on such a large scale, having the most effective [[species]] for silk production, the ''[[Bombyx mandarina]]'' and its [[domesticated]] descendant ''[[Bombyx mori|B. mori]]''. Chinese sources claim the existence of a machine to unwind silkworm cocoons in 1090. The cocoons were placed in a large basin of hot water, the silk would leave the cauldron by tiny guiding rings, and would be wound onto a large [[Bobbin|spool]], thanks to a backwards and forward motion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Little information exists about spinning techniques in use in China.  The [[spinning wheel]], in all likelihood moved by hand, was known by the beginning of the Christian era. The first accepted image of a spinning wheel appears in 1210. There is an image of a silk spinning machine powered by a [[water wheel]] that dates to 1313.\n\nMore information is known about the looms used. The ''Nung Sang Chi Yao'', or ''Fundamentals of Agriculture and Sericulture'', compiled around 1210, is rich with pictures and descriptions, many pertaining to silk.<ref>Joseph Needham, Francesca Bray, Hsing-Tsung Huang, Christian Daniels, Nicholas K.

There are many diagrams originate in the 12th and 13th centuries. When examined closely, many similarities between Eurasian machines can be drawn. Since the [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin]] dynasty, the existence of silk [[damask]]s has been well recorded, and since the 2nd century BC, [[Loom#Weaving|four-shafted looms]] and other innovations allowed the creation of silk [[brocade]]s.\n\n==Silk in the medieval world==\n\n===A more abundant luxury===\n[[Image:M\u00fbrier.JPG|thumb|150px|right|A mature mulberry tree in [[Provence]].]]\nThe [[high Middle Ages]] saw continued use of established techniques for silk manufacture without any changes to speak of, neither in materials nor in tools used. Between the 10th and 12th centuries, small changes began to appear, though the changes of the 13th century were much larger and more radical. In a short time, new fabrics began to appear; [[hemp]] and [[cotton]] each also had their own particular techniques of manufacture. Known since Roman times, silk remained a rare and expensive material.<ref name=Liu/> Byzantine [[magnaneries]] in Greece and [[Syria]]  (6th to 8th centuries), and those of the Arabs in [[Sicily]] and Spain (8th to 10th centuries) were able to supply the luxury material in a much greater abundance.<ref name=Liu>[[Xinru Liu]], ''Silk and Religion: An Exploration of Material Life and the Thought of People AD 600-1200'', Oxford University Press US, 1998.</ref>\n\n===Improved technology===\n\nThe 13th century saw an already changing technology undergo many dramatic changes. It is possible that, as with in England at the end of the 18th century, advances in the textile industry were a driving force behind advances in technology as a whole. Silk indeed occupies a privileged place in history on account of this.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''Histoire des Techniques'' p.553</ref>\n\nAt the start of the 13th century, a primitive form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 [[Johannes de Garlandia (philologist)|Jean de Garlande]]'s dictionary, and in 1226, [[\u00c9tienne Boileau]]'s ''Livre des m\u00e9tiers'' (''Tradesman's Handbook'') enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in [[Bologna]] between 1270 and 1280. From the start of the 14th century, many documents allude to the use of devices that were quite complex.<ref name=\"Techniques' p.557\">{{in lang|fr}} ''Histoire des Techniques'' p.557</ref>\n\nThe [[reel]], originally developed for the silk industry, now has multiple uses. The earliest surviving depiction of a European [[spinning wheel]] is a panel of [[stained glass]] in the [[Cathedral of Chartres]].<ref>Ronan (1994), 68,</ref> <!-- Any mention of the ourdissoir could quite likely have been translated improperly -User:Oreo Priest --> [[Bobbin]]s and [[warp (weaving)|warping]] machines appear together in the stained glass at Chartres and in a [[fresco]] in the [[Cologne]] Kunkelhaus (ca 1300). It is possible that the toothed warping machine was created by the silk industry; it allowed the warp to be more uniform and allowed the warp to be of a longer length.<ref name=\"Techniques' p.557\"/>\n\nStarting at the end of the 14th century, no doubt on account of the devastation caused mid-century by the [[Black Death]], there was a general shift towards less expensive techniques. Many things which would have earlier been completely forbidden by the [[guild]]s were now commonplace (using low quality wool, <!-- didn't translate ensimage, rouet or m\u00e9tiers \u00e0 plusieurs pi\u00e9s -->[[carding]], etc.). In the silk industry, the use of water-powered mills grew, and by the 15th century, the loom designed by Jean le Calabrais saw nearly universal use.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''Histoire des Techniques'' p.639</ref>\n\n===The silk industry in France===\n[[Image:Planche Soie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A picture from the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' of [[Diderot]] and [[d'Alembert]], showing the different steps in sericulture and the manufacture of silk.]]\nItalian silk cloth was very expensive, as much a result of the cost of the raw material as of the production costs. The craftsmen in Italy proved unable to keep up with the exigencies of French fashion, which continuously demanded lighter and less expensive materials.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Autour du Fil, l'encyclop\u00e9die des arts textiles</ref> These materials were used for clothing, and garment production began to be done locally. Nevertheless, Italian silk long remained among the most prized, mostly for furnishings and the brilliant colours of the dyes.\n\nFollowing the example of the wealthy Italian city-states of the era, such as [[Venice]], [[Florence]], and [[Lucca]], which had become the center of the luxury-textile industry, [[Lyon]] obtained a similar function in the French market. In 1466, King [[Louis XI]] decided to develop a national silk industry in Lyon. In the face of protests by the Lyonnais, he conceded and moved the silk fabrication to [[Tours]], but the industry in Tours stayed relatively marginal. His main objective was to reduce France's [[trade deficit]] with the Italian states, which caused France to lose 400,000 to 500,000 golden [[\u00e9cu]]s a year.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Georges Duby (ed), ''Histoire de la France : Dynasties et r\u00e9volutions, de 1348 \u00e0 1852'' (vol. 2), [[\u00c9ditions Larousse|Larousse]], 1999 p. 53 {{ISBN|2-03-505047-2}}</ref> It was under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in around 1535 that a royal charter was granted to two merchants, \u00c9tienne Turquet and Barth\u00e9lemy Naris, to develop a silk trade in Lyon.

The silk industry in the colonies never became very large. Likewise, silk was introduced to numerous other countries, including Mexico, where it was brought by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s|Cortez]] in 1522.

In its early years, there were often disparities in technological innovation between different stages of fabric manufacture, which encouraged complementary innovations. For example, [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] progressed much more rapidly than weaving.\n\nThe silk industry, however, did not gain any benefit from innovations in spinning, as silk is naturally already a thread. Making silk, silver, and gold [[brocade]]s is a very delicate and precise process, with each colour needing its own dedicated [[shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]]. In the 17th and 18th centuries progress began to be made in the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture, with many advances following one after another. [[Basile Bouchon|Bouchon]] and [[Jean Falcon|Falcon]]'s [[punched card]] loom appeared in 1775, later improved on by [[Jacques de Vaucanson]]. Later, [[Joseph-Marie Jacquard]] improved on the designs of Falcon and Vaucanson, introducing the revolutionary [[Jacquard loom]], which allowed a string of punched cards to be processed mechanically in the correct sequence.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''Histoire des techniques'' p.718</ref> The punched cards of the Jacquard loom were a direct precursor to the modern [[computer]], in that they gave a (limited) form of programmability. Punched cards themselves were carried over to computers, and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s. From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the Jacquard loom. The mechanism behind the Jacquard loom even allowed complex designs to be [[mass production|mass-produced]].\n\nThe Jacquard loom was immediately denounced by workers, who accused it of causing [[unemployment]], but soon it had become vital to the industry. The loom was declared public property in 1806, and Jacquard was rewarded with a [[pension]] and a [[Royalties|royalty]] on each machine. In 1834 there were a total of 2885 Jacquard looms in Lyon alone.<ref name=Chauvy/> The [[Canut revolt]] in 1831 foreshadowed many of the larger worker uprisings of the Industrial Revolution. The canuts occupied the city of Lyon, and would not relinquish it until a bloody repression by the army, led by [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]]. A second revolt, similar to the first, took place in 1834.\n\n===Decline in the European silk industry===\nThe first silkworm diseases began to appear in 1845, creating an epidemic. Among them are [[p\u00e9brine]], caused by the [[microsporidia]] ''Nosema bombycis'', grasserie, caused by a [[virus]], [[flacherie]], caused by eating infected mulberry leaves or [[white muscardine disease]], caused by the [[fungus]] ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]''. The epidemic grew to a massive scale, and after having attacked the silkworms, other viruses began to infect the mulberry trees. The chemist [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]], French minister of agriculture, was charged with stopping the epidemic. In face of sericulturers' call for help, he asked [[Louis Pasteur]] to study the disease, starting in 1865.<ref>\"[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568595/Louis_Pasteur.html Louis Pasteur],\" Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007.

In 1870 he changed his view, and measures were enacted that caused the disease to decline.\n\nNevertheless, the increase in the price of silkworm cocoons and the reduction in importance of silk in the garments of the [[bourgeoisie]] in the 19th century caused the decline of the silk industry in Europe. The opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 and the silk shortage in France reduced the price of importing Asian silk, particularly from China and Japan.<ref>A. J. H. Latham and Heita Kawakatsu, ''Japanese Industrialization and the Asian Economy'' p. 199</ref>\n\nStarting from the [[Long Depression]] (1873\u20131896), Lyonnais silk production had become totally industrialized, and hand looms were rapidly disappearing. The 19th century saw the textile industry's progress caused by advances in chemistry. The [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of [[aniline]] was used to make [[mauveine]] (aniline purple) [[dye]] and the synthesis of [[quinine]] was used to make [[indigo]] dye. In 1884 Count Hilaire de Chardonnet invented artificial silk and in 1891 opened a factory dedicated to the production of artificial silk ([[viscose]]), which cost much less and in part replaced natural silk.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:DMM 29263ab Jacquardwebstuhl.jpg|A [[Jacquard loom]].\nFile:Silk industry- spinning, winding, doubling and throwing machines.

Silk remained confined to China until the [[Silk Road]] opened at some point during the later half of the 1st millennium BC. China maintained its virtual [[monopoly]] over [[sericulture|silk production]] for another thousand years. Not confined to [[ancient Chinese clothing|clothing]], silk was also used for a number of other applications, including writing, and the color of silk worn was an important guide of [[social class]] during the [[Tang dynasty]].\n\nSilk cultivation spread to Japan around 300 AD, and, by 552 AD, the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] managed to obtain [[silkworm]] eggs and were able to begin silkworm cultivation. The Arabs also began to manufacture silk at the same time. As a result of the spread of [[sericulture]], Chinese silk exports became less important, although they still maintained dominance over the [[luxury goods|luxury]] silk market. The [[Crusades]] brought silk production to Western Europe, in particular to many Italian states, which saw an economic boom exporting silk to the rest of Europe. Changes in manufacturing techniques also began to take place during the Middle Ages, with devices such as the [[spinning wheel]] first appearing. During the 16th century, France joined Italy in developing a successful silk trade, though the efforts of most other nations to develop a silk industry of their own were unsuccessful.\n\nThe [[Industrial Revolution]] changed much of Europe's silk industry. Due to innovations on spinning [[cotton]], cotton became much cheaper to manufacture and therefore caused more expensive silk production to become less mainstream. New weaving technologies, however, increased the efficiency of production. Among these was the [[Jacquard loom]], developed for silk embroidery. An [[epidemic]] of several silkworm diseases caused production to fall, especially in France, where the industry never recovered. In the 20th century Japan and China regained their earlier role in silk production, and China is now once again the world's largest producer of silk. The rise of new fabrics such as [[nylon]] reduced the prevalence of silk throughout the world, and silk is now once again a rare luxury good, much less important than in its heyday.\n\n==Early history==\n[[Image:Bombyx mori Cocon 02.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The silkworm cocoon]]\n\n===First appearance of silk===\nThe earliest evidence of silk was found at the sites of [[Yangshao culture]] in [[Xia County]], [[Shanxi]], where a silk cocoon was found cut in half by a sharp knife, dating back to between 4000 and 3000 BC. The species was identified as ''[[Bombyx mori]]'', the domesticated silkworm. Fragments of primitive loom can also be seen from the sites of [[Hemudu culture]] in [[Yuyao|Yuyao, Zhejiang]], dated to about 4000 BC. The earliest example of silk fabric is from 3630 BC, and was used as wrapping for the body of a child.

Having observed the life of the silk worm on the recommendation of her husband, the [[Yellow Emperor]], she began to instruct her entourage in the art of raising silk worms, [[sericulture]]. From this point, the girl became the goddess of silk in [[Chinese mythology]]. Silk eventually left China via the heir of a princess who was promised to a prince of [[Khotan]].

Even though some saw the development of a luxury product as useless, silk provoked such a craze among high society that the rules in the ''[[Classic of Rites|Li Ji]]'' were used to limit its use to the members of the imperial family.<ref name=Meyer/> For approximately a millennium, the right to wear silk was reserved for the emperor and the highest dignitaries. Silk was, at the time, a sign of great wealth, because of its shimmering appearance. This appearance was due to silk's prism-like shape/structure, which refracted light from every angle. After some time, silk gradually extended to other classes of Chinese society, like the noble class and such. Silk began to be used for decorative means and also in less luxurious ways: musical instruments, fishing, and bow making.

It was used to pay government officials and compensate citizens who were particularly worthy. By the same token that one would sometimes estimate the price of products according to a certain weight of [[gold]], the length of the [[Economy of the Han Dynasty|silk cloth became a monetary standard in China]] (in addition to [[Ancient Chinese coinage|bronze coins]]). The wealth that silk brought to China stirred envy in neighboring peoples. Beginning in the 2nd century BC, the [[Xiongnu]] regularly pillaged the provinces of the Han Chinese for around 250 years. [[History of the Han Dynasty|Silk]] was a common offering by the emperor to these tribes in exchange for peace.\n\nSilk is described in a chapter of the ''[[Fan Shengzhi shu]]'' from the Western Han (206 BC \u2013 9 AD).

For example, the [[Tang Dynasty]]  and [[Song Dynasty]] imposed upon [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|bureaucrats]] the use of particular colors according to their functions in society. Under the [[Ming Dynasty|Ming]], silk began to be used in a series of accessories: [[handkerchief]]s, wallets, belts, or even an embroidered piece of fabric displaying dozens of animals, real or mythical. These fashion accessories remained associated with a particular position: there was a specific [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]] for [[warrior]]s, for [[judge]]s, for [[nobles]], and others for religious use.

Gaining momentum, in order to satisfy the rich and powerful [[bourgeoisie]]'s demands for luxury fabrics, the cities of [[Lucca]], [[Genoa]], [[Venice]] and [[Florence]] were soon exporting silk to all of Europe. In 1472 there were 84 workshops and at least 7000 craftsmen in Florence alone.\n\n===Reciprocal influences===\n[[File:SSACRAM 116.JPG|thumb|Polychrome embroidery in silk, 17th century, Antwerp]]\n[[Image:Brocart de soie fran\u00e7ais.jpg|thumb|200px|right|French silk [[brocade]] - [[Lyon]] 1760-1770]]\nSilk was made using various breeds of [[lepidoptera]]ns, both wild and domestic. While [[wild silk]]s were produced in many countries, there is no doubt that the Chinese were the first to begin production on such a large scale, having the most effective [[species]] for silk production, the ''[[Bombyx mandarina]]'' and its [[domesticated]] descendant ''[[Bombyx mori|B. mori]]''. Chinese sources claim the existence of a machine to unwind silkworm cocoons in 1090. The cocoons were placed in a large basin of hot water, the silk would leave the cauldron by tiny guiding rings, and would be wound onto a large [[Bobbin|spool]], thanks to a backwards and forward motion.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Little information exists about spinning techniques in use in China.  The [[spinning wheel]], in all likelihood moved by hand, was known by the beginning of the Christian era. The first accepted image of a spinning wheel appears in 1210. There is an image of a silk spinning machine powered by a [[water wheel]] that dates to 1313.\n\nMore information is known about the looms used. The ''Nung Sang Chi Yao'', or ''Fundamentals of Agriculture and Sericulture'', compiled around 1210, is rich with pictures and descriptions, many pertaining to silk.<ref>Joseph Needham, Francesca Bray, Hsing-Tsung Huang, Christian Daniels, Nicholas K. Menzies, ''Science and Civilisation in China'', Cambridge University Press, 1984 p. 72 {{ISBN|0-521-25076-5}}</ref> It repeatedly claims the Chinese looms to be far superior to all others. It speaks of two types of loom that leave the worker's arms free: the [[Loom#Drawloom|drawloom]], which is of Eurasian origin, and the pedal loom which is attributed to East Asian origins. There are many diagrams originate in the 12th and 13th centuries. When examined closely, many similarities between Eurasian machines can be drawn. Since the [[Jin Dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin]] dynasty, the existence of silk [[damask]]s has been well recorded, and since the 2nd century BC, [[Loom#Weaving|four-shafted looms]] and other innovations allowed the creation of silk [[brocade]]s.\n\n==Silk in the medieval world==\n\n===A more abundant luxury===\n[[Image:M\u00fbrier.JPG|thumb|150px|right|A mature mulberry tree in [[Provence]].]]\nThe [[high Middle Ages]] saw continued use of established techniques for silk manufacture without any changes to speak of, neither in materials nor in tools used. Between the 10th and 12th centuries, small changes began to appear, though the changes of the 13th century were much larger and more radical. In a short time, new fabrics began to appear; [[hemp]] and [[cotton]] each also had their own particular techniques of manufacture. Known since Roman times, silk remained a rare and expensive material.<ref name=Liu/> Byzantine [[magnaneries]] in Greece and [[Syria]]  (6th to 8th centuries), and those of the Arabs in [[Sicily]] and Spain (8th to 10th centuries) were able to supply the luxury material in a much greater abundance.<ref name=Liu>[[Xinru Liu]], ''Silk and Religion: An Exploration of Material Life and the Thought of People AD 600-1200'', Oxford University Press US, 1998.</ref>\n\n===Improved technology===\n\nThe 13th century saw an already changing technology undergo many dramatic changes. It is possible that, as with in England at the end of the 18th century, advances in the textile industry were a driving force behind advances in technology as a whole. Silk indeed occupies a privileged place in history on account of this.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''Histoire des Techniques'' p.553</ref>\n\nAt the start of the 13th century, a primitive form of milling the silk threads was already in use. In 1221 [[Johannes de Garlandia (philologist)|Jean de Garlande]]'s dictionary, and in 1226, [[\u00c9tienne Boileau]]'s ''Livre des m\u00e9tiers'' (''Tradesman's Handbook'') enumerated many types of devices which can only have been doubling machines. The instruments used were further perfected in [[Bologna]] between 1270 and 1280. From the start of the 14th century, many documents allude to the use of devices that were quite complex.<ref name=\"Techniques' p.557\">{{in lang|fr}} ''Histoire des Techniques'' p.557</ref>\n\nThe [[reel]], originally developed for the silk industry, now has multiple uses. The earliest surviving depiction of a European [[spinning wheel]] is a panel of [[stained glass]] in the [[Cathedral of Chartres]].<ref>Ronan (1994), 68,</ref> <!-- Any mention of the ourdissoir could quite likely have been translated improperly -User:Oreo Priest --> [[Bobbin]]s and [[warp (weaving)|warping]] machines appear together in the stained glass at Chartres and in a [[fresco]] in the [[Cologne]] Kunkelhaus (ca 1300). It is possible that the toothed warping machine was created by the silk industry; it allowed the warp to be more uniform and allowed the warp to be of a longer length.<ref name=\"Techniques' p.557\"/>\n\nStarting at the end of the 14th century, no doubt on account of the devastation caused mid-century by the [[Black Death]], there was a general shift towards less expensive techniques. Many things which would have earlier been completely forbidden by the [[guild]]s were now commonplace (using low quality wool, <!-- didn't translate ensimage, rouet or m\u00e9tiers \u00e0 plusieurs pi\u00e9s -->[[carding]], etc.). In the silk industry, the use of water-powered mills grew, and by the 15th century, the loom designed by Jean le Calabrais saw nearly universal use.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''Histoire des Techniques'' p.639</ref>\n\n===The silk industry in France===\n[[Image:Planche Soie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A picture from the ''[[Encyclop\u00e9die]]'' of [[Diderot]] and [[d'Alembert]], showing the different steps in sericulture and the manufacture of silk.]]\nItalian silk cloth was very expensive, as much a result of the cost of the raw material as of the production costs. The craftsmen in Italy proved unable to keep up with the exigencies of French fashion, which continuously demanded lighter and less expensive materials.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Autour du Fil, l'encyclop\u00e9die des arts textiles</ref> These materials were used for clothing, and garment production began to be done locally. Nevertheless, Italian silk long remained among the most prized, mostly for furnishings and the brilliant colours of the dyes.\n\nFollowing the example of the wealthy Italian city-states of the era, such as [[Venice]], [[Florence]], and [[Lucca]], which had become the center of the luxury-textile industry, [[Lyon]] obtained a similar function in the French market. In 1466, King [[Louis XI]] decided to develop a national silk industry in Lyon. In the face of protests by the Lyonnais, he conceded and moved the silk fabrication to [[Tours]], but the industry in Tours stayed relatively marginal. His main objective was to reduce France's [[trade deficit]] with the Italian states, which caused France to lose 400,000 to 500,000 golden [[\u00e9cu]]s a year.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Georges Duby (ed), ''Histoire de la France : Dynasties et r\u00e9volutions, de 1348 \u00e0 1852'' (vol. 2), [[\u00c9ditions Larousse|Larousse]], 1999 p. 53 {{ISBN|2-03-505047-2}}</ref> It was under [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] in around 1535 that a royal charter was granted to two merchants, \u00c9tienne Turquet and Barth\u00e9lemy Naris, to develop a silk trade in Lyon. In 1540, the king granted a [[monopoly]] on silk production to the city of Lyon. Starting in the 16th century, Lyon became the capital of the European silk trade, notably producing many reputable fashions.<ref name=Chauvy>{{in lang|fr}} G\u00e9rard Chauvy, \"La dure condition des for\u00e7ats du luxe\", ''Historia'', n\u00b0648, December 2000</ref> Gaining confidence, the silks produced in the city began to abandon the original oriental styles in favor of their own distinctive style, which emphasized landscapes. Thousand of workers, the [[canut]]s, devoted themselves to the flourishing industry. In the middle of the 17th century, over 14,000 looms were used in Lyon, and the silk industry fed a third of the city's population.<ref name=Chauvy/>\n\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, [[Provence]] experienced a boom in sericulture that would last until the first world war, with much of the silk shipped north to Lyon.

Some areas, including [[Spitalfields]] saw many high-quality silk workshops spring up, their products distinct from continental silk largely by the colors used.<ref>Thirsk (1997), 120.</ref> Nonetheless, the [[Climate of the United Kingdom|British climate]] prevented England's domestic silk trade from becoming globally dominant.\n\nMany envisioned starting a silk industry in the [[Colonial history of the United States|British colonies in America]], starting in 1619, under the reign of King [[James I of England]]. The silk industry in the colonies never became very large. Likewise, silk was introduced to numerous other countries, including Mexico, where it was brought by [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s|Cortez]] in 1522. Only rarely did these new silk industries grow to any significant size.<ref>Peter N.

In its early years, there were often disparities in technological innovation between different stages of fabric manufacture, which encouraged complementary innovations. For example, [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]] progressed much more rapidly than weaving.\n\nThe silk industry, however, did not gain any benefit from innovations in spinning, as silk is naturally already a thread. Making silk, silver, and gold [[brocade]]s is a very delicate and precise process, with each colour needing its own dedicated [[shuttle (weaving)|shuttle]]. In the 17th and 18th centuries progress began to be made in the simplification and standardization of silk manufacture, with many advances following one after another. [[Basile Bouchon|Bouchon]] and [[Jean Falcon|Falcon]]'s [[punched card]] loom appeared in 1775, later improved on by [[Jacques de Vaucanson]]. Later, [[Joseph-Marie Jacquard]] improved on the designs of Falcon and Vaucanson, introducing the revolutionary [[Jacquard loom]], which allowed a string of punched cards to be processed mechanically in the correct sequence.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''Histoire des techniques'' p.718</ref> The punched cards of the Jacquard loom were a direct precursor to the modern [[computer]], in that they gave a (limited) form of programmability. Punched cards themselves were carried over to computers, and were ubiquitous until their obsolescence in the 1970s. From 1801 embroidery became highly mechanized due to the effectiveness of the Jacquard loom. The mechanism behind the Jacquard loom even allowed complex designs to be [[mass production|mass-produced]].\n\nThe Jacquard loom was immediately denounced by workers, who accused it of causing [[unemployment]], but soon it had become vital to the industry. The loom was declared public property in 1806, and Jacquard was rewarded with a [[pension]] and a [[Royalties|royalty]] on each machine. In 1834 there were a total of 2885 Jacquard looms in Lyon alone.<ref name=Chauvy/> The [[Canut revolt]] in 1831 foreshadowed many of the larger worker uprisings of the Industrial Revolution. The canuts occupied the city of Lyon, and would not relinquish it until a bloody repression by the army, led by [[Nicolas Jean de Dieu Soult|Marshal Soult]]. A second revolt, similar to the first, took place in 1834.\n\n===Decline in the European silk industry===\nThe first silkworm diseases began to appear in 1845, creating an epidemic. Among them are [[p\u00e9brine]], caused by the [[microsporidia]] ''Nosema bombycis'', grasserie, caused by a [[virus]], [[flacherie]], caused by eating infected mulberry leaves or [[white muscardine disease]], caused by the [[fungus]] ''[[Beauveria bassiana]]''. The epidemic grew to a massive scale, and after having attacked the silkworms, other viruses began to infect the mulberry trees. The chemist [[Jean-Baptiste Dumas]], French minister of agriculture, was charged with stopping the epidemic. In face of sericulturers' call for help, he asked [[Louis Pasteur]] to study the disease, starting in 1865.<ref>\"[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761568595/Louis_Pasteur.html Louis Pasteur],\" Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007.

In 1870 he changed his view, and measures were enacted that caused the disease to decline.\n\nNevertheless, the increase in the price of silkworm cocoons and the reduction in importance of silk in the garments of the [[bourgeoisie]] in the 19th century caused the decline of the silk industry in Europe. The opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869 and the silk shortage in France reduced the price of importing Asian silk, particularly from China and Japan.<ref>A. J. H. Latham and Heita Kawakatsu, ''Japanese Industrialization and the Asian Economy'' p. 199</ref>\n\nStarting from the [[Long Depression]] (1873\u20131896), Lyonnais silk production had become totally industrialized, and hand looms were rapidly disappearing. The 19th century saw the textile industry's progress caused by advances in chemistry. The [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of [[aniline]] was used to make [[mauveine]] (aniline purple) [[dye]] and the synthesis of [[quinine]] was used to make [[indigo]] dye. In 1884 Count Hilaire de Chardonnet invented artificial silk and in 1891 opened a factory dedicated to the production of artificial silk ([[viscose]]), which cost much less and in part replaced natural silk.\n\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"220px\">\nFile:DMM 29263ab Jacquardwebstuhl.jpg|A [[Jacquard loom]].\nFile:Silk industry- spinning, winding, doubling and throwing machines.

Urbanization in Europe saw many French and Italian agricultural workers leave silk growing for more lucrative factory work. Raw silk was imported from Japan to fill the void.<ref name = SAGB/> Asian countries, formerly exporters of [[raw material]]s (cocoons and raw silk), progressively began to export more and more finished garments.\n\nDuring the Second World War, silk supplies from Japan were cut off, so western countries were forced to find substitutes.

Manufactured by [[Mack Rides]] of Germany in collaboration with the park's in-house team, Time Traveler opened in 2018, becoming Silver Dollar City's first new roller coaster since [[Outlaw Run]] opened in 2013. Time Traveler features the fictional story of [[clockmaker]] Charles Henry and his daughter spotlighting human achievements through [[time travel]]. The roller coaster reaches a height of {{Convert|100|ft|adj=off}} with a maximum speed of {{Convert|50.3|mph|km/h}} and a total track length of {{Convert|3,020|ft|adj=off}}.\n\nUpon opening, Time Traveler became the fastest and tallest complete circuit spinning roller coaster, the first to feature three [[Roller coaster inversion|inversions]], and the first model of \"X-treme Spinning Coasters\" produced by Mack Rides. In 2018, the roller coaster was listed by ''[[Amusement Today]]''<nowiki/>'s annual [[Golden Ticket Awards]] as the year's second-best new steel roller coaster and was the year's 18th-best steel roller coaster.\n\n== History ==\nThe original idea and planning for a new attraction\u2014which would become Time Traveler\u2014lasted over four years. In January 2016, while a prototype for a new [[spinning roller coaster]] concept was being made by [[Mack Rides]], Jane Cooper, [[chief operating officer]] and president of [[Herschend Family Entertainment]], and Brad Thomas, president of attractions for [[Silver Dollar City]], went to test it at [[Europa-Park]] where it was featured on the roller coaster [[Blue Fire]]. During their first trip, Thomas described the first experience on the prototype they had was \"really like a [[Teacups|teacup]]\",<ref name=\":11\" /> but showed promise for the project and design. Thereafter, both Cooper and Thomas made various trips to the park to discuss and plan the ride's concept with Mack Rides before acquiring the model for the park's new attraction.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nFrom February 2016, Herschend Family Entertainment (owner of Silver Dollar City) filed trademarks with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] for multiple names including \"Barke\", \"Time Traveler\", and \"Top Dog\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite

Each of the trains have an [[eddy current brake]] situated under the coaster's car.<ref name=\":11\" /> When the coaster's metallic disc, located on the upper part of the car, passes through the locked brake, it acts as a conductive surface assisting in rotating the car frame as well as slowing the rotation. The eddy brake can be tightened or loosened to adjust the rotation of the coaster's car. The trains feature a [[power rail]] system to align the coaster's cars as they are stationary in the brake run returning to the station, which in addition works as a charger for the on-ride decorated [[LED|lights]] on the hand railings located in front of the riders. A [[busbar]] located under the ride's train conveys data from the cars to the operator's control systems. The [[lap bar]] restraints automatically lower on each train and are locked into place by [[hydraulic cylinder]]s, which are checked by ride attendants and operators. Steel bristles are additionally located near each of the car's wheels to release [[electric charge]]s a train may produce and hinder electronics on them.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Records ==\nWhen the roller coaster opened in 2018, it became the fastest and tallest full circuit spinning roller coaster. Although not a full circuit spinning roller coaster, Big Air located at [[E-DA Theme Park]] would be the fastest and tallest spinning roller coaster.

Manufactured by [[Mack Rides]] of Germany in collaboration with the park's in-house team, Time Traveler opened in 2018, becoming Silver Dollar City's first new roller coaster since [[Outlaw Run]] opened in 2013. Time Traveler features the fictional story of [[clockmaker]] Charles Henry and his daughter spotlighting human achievements through [[time travel]]. The roller coaster reaches a height of {{Convert|100|ft|adj=off}} with a maximum speed of {{Convert|50.3|mph|km/h}} and a total track length of {{Convert|3,020|ft|adj=off}}.\n\nUpon opening, Time Traveler became the fastest and tallest complete circuit spinning roller coaster, the first to feature three [[Roller coaster inversion|inversions]], and the first model of \"X-treme Spinning Coasters\" produced by Mack Rides. In 2018, the roller coaster was listed by ''[[Amusement Today]]''<nowiki/>'s annual [[Golden Ticket Awards]] as the year's second-best new steel roller coaster and was the year's 18th-best steel roller coaster.\n\n== History ==\nThe original idea and planning for a new attraction\u2014which would become Time Traveler\u2014lasted over four years. In January 2016, while a prototype for a new [[spinning roller coaster]] concept was being made by [[Mack Rides]], Jane Cooper, [[chief operating officer]] and president of [[Herschend Family Entertainment]], and Brad Thomas, president of attractions for [[Silver Dollar City]], went to test it at [[Europa-Park]] where it was featured on the roller coaster [[Blue Fire]]. During their first trip, Thomas described the first experience on the prototype they had was \"really like a [[Teacups|teacup]]\",<ref name=\":11\" /> but showed promise for the project and design. Thereafter, both Cooper and Thomas made various trips to the park to discuss and plan the ride's concept with Mack Rides before acquiring the model for the park's new attraction.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\nFrom February 2016, Herschend Family Entertainment (owner of Silver Dollar City) filed trademarks with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] for multiple names including \"Barke\", \"Time Traveler\", and \"Top Dog\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite

Each of the trains have an [[eddy current brake]] situated under the coaster's car.<ref name=\":11\" /> When the coaster's metallic disc, located on the upper part of the car, passes through the locked brake, it acts as a conductive surface assisting in rotating the car frame as well as slowing the rotation. The eddy brake can be tightened or loosened to adjust the rotation of the coaster's car. The trains feature a [[power rail]] system to align the coaster's cars as they are stationary in the brake run returning to the station, which in addition works as a charger for the on-ride decorated [[LED|lights]] on the hand railings located in front of the riders. A [[busbar]] located under the ride's train conveys data from the cars to the operator's control systems. The [[lap bar]] restraints automatically lower on each train and are locked into place by [[hydraulic cylinder]]s, which are checked by ride attendants and operators. Steel bristles are additionally located near each of the car's wheels to release [[electric charge]]s a train may produce and hinder electronics on them.<ref name=\":11\" />\n\n== Records ==\nWhen the roller coaster opened in 2018, it became the fastest and tallest full circuit spinning roller coaster.

Opened on May 1, 1960, the park is located between [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]] and [[Branson West, Missouri|Branson West]] off of [[Missouri Route 76]] on the Indian Point peninsula of [[Table Rock Lake]]. The park is an 1880s-themed experience that fits [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]]'s vision as a family-friendly vacation destination with down-home charm. Silver Dollar City's operating season runs from mid-March until late December, with the park closed during the months of January and February. Silver Dollar City is owned by [[Herschend Family Entertainment]].\n\n==History==\n===Marvel Cave===\n[[File:Marvel Cave.JPG|thumb|Marvel Cave entrance and rubble pile viewed from within]]\nSilver Dollar City is situated at the site of one of [[the Ozarks]]' oldest attractions, [[Marvel Cave]]. [[Henry T. Blow]], a [[lead]] mining magnate, explored the cave with six miners. They found no lead, but were convinced that the flat ceiling of one room was composed of [[marble]], they originally named the cave Marble Cave. The cave remained undisturbed until 1882 when a group led by [[T. Hodges Jones]] and [[Truman S. Powell]] entered the cave in hopes of finding lead. Jones and Powell instead found huge amounts of [[guano]] and a flat wall which they also believed to be marble. Two years later Jones bought the property and formed the Marble Cave Mining and Manufacturing Company. The company planned a town, Marble City, on the rough hilltop near the cave and in 1884 recorded a [[plat]] map at the courthouse in [[Galena, Missouri]]. By 1889 much of the guano had been mined from the cave, the marble wall proved to be [[limestone]], and no lead ore was found. The mining company ceased operation.\n\nIn 1889, William Henry Lynch, a Canadian miner and dairyman, purchased the cave and a square mile around it for $10,000 ({{Inflation|r=-3|fmt=eq|US|10000|1889}}). Lynch, with the aid of his family, proposed to open the cave to sightseers. The Lynches began operation of the sightseeing venture in 1894. The venture was not immediately profitable and was closed until Lynch raised additional capital to reopen the cave sometime after 1900. The cave has remained open since, making it one of the oldest continuously running tourist attractions in the Ozarks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Herschend family===\nWhen William Lynch died in 1927, ownership of the cave passed to his daughters and the name of the cave was changed to Marvel Cave. The Lynch family operated the cave for nearly fifty years until a Chicago [[vacuum cleaner]] salesman, Hugo Herschend, purchased a 100-year lease on the cave.\n\nAfter Hugo's death his wife, Mary, took over the day-to-day operations of the venture. With the aid of her two sons, Jack and Peter, she was able to make vast improvements to the cave, including the inclusion of a [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[funicular]] railway, whose trains pulled visitors a distance of {{convert|218|ft|m}} from the depths of the cave up to the surface.\n\nOnce the railway was in operation the Herschends felt the development of the cave was complete, so they decided to create another attraction which would bring even more tourists to the cave.\n\n===New theme park===\nMary, Jack and Pete began building the 1880s Ozark village. Mary wanted authenticity and preservation as well as preserving the natural beauty of the area. The Herschends built the Ozark frontier town on the land surrounding the site of the cave. Silver Dollar City originally was the site of five shops, a church, a log cabin, and a street production reproducing the feud between the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud|Hatfields and McCoys]] several times daily.\n\nThe name was inspired by ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' script writer and publicist Don Richardson after the promotional idea of giving visitors [[Peace Dollar|silver dollars]] in change.<ref>Brothers, Michael A. \"'Ozark Jubilee': a Musical Legacy\" (March 2, 2003), ''[[Springfield News-Leader]]'', p. 1C</ref> The scenic designer for much of the original attraction was Andy Miller, who had been the set designer for the ''Jubilee'' in nearby [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]]. Opening day, May 1, 1960, included an appearance by [[Uncle Cyp and Aunt Sap Brasfield]].<ref>\"Missouri Spot Opens May 1; Draws 18,000\" (May 9, 1960), ''[[Billboard (magazine)|The Billboard]]'', p. 103</ref> The first year, Silver Dollar City drew more than 125,000 people, four times more visitors than the number that toured Marvel Cave. \"We discovered we were in the theme park business,\" Pete Herschend said.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn 1968, the park started charging admission.\n\nIn 1972 Genevieve Lynch, the last of William Lynch's daughters, died and she bequeathed the land under Silver Dollar City and Marvel Cave to the [[College of the Ozarks]] and Branson Presbyterian Church.<ref>Missouri Roadsides: The Traveler's Companion \u2013 Bill Earngey \u2013 University of Missouri Press (October 1995) \u2013 {{ISBN|0-8262-1021-X}}</ref> The Herschends continue to operate it.\n\nIn 1976, the Herschends purchased the Goldrush Junction theme park in [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]], which they renamed Silver Dollar City Tennessee. In 1986, the Herschends partnered with [[Dolly Parton]] and renamed the park to [[Dollywood]].\n\nSilver Dollar City expanded its entertainment over the years by adding attractions such as a stage coach ride, a steam engine train, interactive activities and various thrill rides. The park is also home to resident craftsmen who can be seen practicing their craft and exhibiting and selling their work to park visitors.\n\n===Pop culture===\nThe Clampett family of CBS-TV's ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' decided to pay a visit to Silver Dollar City (treated as an actual town, rather than a theme park) to start off the 1969\u20131970 [[season]]. The plotline involved Granny ([[Irene Ryan]]) attempting to find a husband for Elly May ([[Donna Douglas]]) back in the hills, while Jed ([[Buddy Ebsen]]) socialized with hotel clerk Shorty Kellems ([[Shug Fisher]]). They visited the blacksmith Shad Heller, soapmaker Granny Ethel Huffman, and woodcarver Peter Engler, and Miss Hathaway ([[Nancy Kulp]]) was seen in the Ozark woods. The ''Hillbillies'' were from the area surrounding Silver Dollar City and Branson, and references to Jim Owens and his White River float trip business and some Missouri mountain locations were made throughout the show's nine-year run. Five episodes of ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' were eventually shot in the park.\n\nIn 1999, Silver Dollar City was the site for the 14th annual [[Stihl Timbersports Series]] Championships. [[Jason Wynyard]], becoming the champion for the third consecutive year.\n\nOn July 5, 2007, Silver Dollar City was featured in an episode of the soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]''.\n\nOn December 5, 2007, ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'' spotlighted the park\u2019s Christmas festival, \u201cAn Old Time Christmas,\u201d and declared it as one of the top five holiday events in the country. The park was featured as part of the show\u2019s segment called \u201cGood Morning America Lights Up the Holidays.\u201d{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nFrom June 21\u201323, 2009, the park hosted the [[American Coaster Enthusiasts]]' national summer convention.\n\nThe park was featured in the book ''[[The Man Who Loved Clowns]]''.\n\n==Layout, attractions and general information==\n\n===Districts===\nSilver Dollar City is divided into ten districts.\n\n* Park Entrance\n* Main Street\n* Homestead Ridge\n* Midtown\n* Valley Road\n* The Grand Exposition\n* Riverfront\n* Wilson\u2019s Farm\n* Hugo\u2019s Hill Street\n* Fireman's Landing\n\n===Demonstrations===\n* Brown's Candy Factory\n* Carrie's Candles\n* Duplicating Lathe\n* Hazel's Blown & Cut Glass\n* Heartland Home Furnishings\n* Hillcreek Pottery\n* Mountain Leather\n* Mountain Outfitter's Knives\n* Sullivan's Mill\n* Valley Road Woodcarvers\n* Wilderness Road Blacksmith\n\n===Recurring shows===\n\n* Horsecreek Band\n* Old-Time Story Time\n* Pure Heart\n* The Homestead Pickers\n* Sons of the Silver Dollar\n\n===Rides and Attractions===\n[[File:Wildfire Silver Dollar City.jpg|thumb|WildFire]]\n<!-- Please add in alphabetical order -->\n\n===Roller Coasters===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The Traditional Cave Tour is a one-hour guided tour through a half mile of lighted passageway. Throughout the tour, geological and historical information is explained. The Lantern Light Tour is a one and a half-hour guided tour through a little over a half mile of unlit passageway. A [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[funicular]] railway is employed to take visitors from the far end of the cave back to surface level.\n* McHaffie's Homestead \u2013 a real, hewn-log cabin built in 1843.\n* Oak Trail School \u2013 a 19th-century school house where everyone is invited to pick a desk, sit down and learn about school in the 1800s.\n* Swinging Bridge\n* Wilderness Church \u2013 an old-time church with a view of the Ozark and Boston Mountains of Arkansas. Services are held on Sundays.\n\n====Former rides and attractions====\n*Sam\u2019s Minin\u2019 Shack \u2013 closed in 1968 and re-themed as Grandfather's Mansion.\n*Buzz Saw Falls \u2013 This was a [[roller coaster]] that incorporated a water type boat for the vehicle. The ride was largely promoted, however it was constantly plagued with mechanical difficulties. It was closed in 2003 and construction began to modify the ride into Powder Keg, which opened in 2005.\n*Rube Dugan's Diving Bell \u2013 This was an attraction that simulated a [[Jules Verne]]-style fantasy submarine ride, the first simulation ride of its kind. [[Walt Disney Imagineering|Disney Imagineers]] told Silver Dollar City that it would be hard to do but secretly advised them on how to create the attraction.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} It was removed in the mid-1980s to make room for the Lost River of the Ozarks, a ride that could run more people through per hour. [[Slim Pickens]] was the voice of Rube Dugan.\n* Lost River of the Ozarks \u2013 This ride was a whitewater rapids adventure using 6-person inner tube shaped boats.  Signage cautioned riders that they would get \"bathtub wet.\"  It was constructed on the former site of Rube Dugan's Diving Bell.  The Lost River of the Ozarks opened May 4, 1985 at a cost of $2 million<ref>[https://www.ky3.com/content/news/Silver-Dollar-City-fences-up-popular-ride-in-anticipation-for-something-503908691.html Silver Dollar City Closes Popular Ride in Anticipation for Something New] (January 4, 2019), ''[[KYTV (TV)|KY3]]''</ref> and was demolished following the 2018 season.\n*Jim Owens Float Trip \u2013 This was an outdoor boat ride (1969 to 1980) around a man-made river with animatronics. Silver Dollar City removed this ride after the 1980 season and remodeled it into the American Plunge [[log flume]]. However, the original channels still exist and can be seen as guests make their way to Wildfire and from the queue line for American Plunge.\n*Stagecoach \u2013 In the early years of the park, an authentic stagecoach took guests on a bumpy ride around the perimeter of the town square pulled by sturdy draft horses. It was removed five years after the park opened.\n*Runaway Ore Cart \u2013 This was a small children's roller coaster that was removed after the 2004 season.\n*[[Tom Sawyer]]'s Landing \u2013 Added to the park in 1984, this play area featured rope towers and rides with Becky's Carousel as its center piece. Silver Dollar City's craftsmen hand carved each horse on the carousel. The most notable aspect of the structure were the large rope nets upon which visitors bounced and climbed.\n*[[Huck Finn]]'s Hideaway \u2013 This was a large playhouse built several stories above the ground on stilts. Visitors entered the attraction via a tiny spiral staircase built into a fake hollow tree. They had to crawl on hands and knees across a narrow bridge from the top of the hollow tree to the tree house. The exit from the attraction led visitors through an artificial cave featuring an infinite mirror illusion and Christmas lights to make it appear that they were walking through a large open space with \"stars\".\n* Waterworks Waterboggan \u2013 a flume-type water ride, mostly through a dark tunnel so the sudden turns took riders by surprise.\n* Splash Harbor \u2013 was located near the bathrooms of Geyser Gulch.\n* Geyser Gulch \u2013 This was an area built in 1997 with two large buildings. Kids could run throughout the building located by the \"lake\" and shoot each other with water guns, while dodging balls being thrown by other kids or through tubes. There were also water sprinklers outside the building where children can run through. Geyser Gulch closed on August 3, 2014 to make way for Fireman's Landing.\n\n===Festivals===\nThroughout the operating season Silver Dollar City hosts six different festivals:\n\n*Festival of Wonder (April): a spring festival showcasing unusual acts and performances.\n*Bluegrass & BBQ Festival (May): a celebration of [[bluegrass music]] and [[BBQ]] from across the nation.\n*Star-Spangled Summer (June \u2013 August): a summer festival featuring shows and activities that appeal to families with children.\n*Moonlight Madness (July 18- June 1): Ride all day and into the night on over 40 thrilling rides & attractions as you enjoy over 12 straight hours of nonstop fun for 16 straight days! \n*Southern Gospel Picnic (August \u2013 September): Gospel music is showcased during this festival along with picnic style dinners\n*Country Music days (September- September): Enjoy 13 days of concerts featuring classic country stars, plus Saturday night celebrity concerts in Echo Hollow\u00ae Amphitheatre .\n*National Harvest & Pumpkin nights (September \u2013 October): a salute to an old time [[harvest]] celebration featuring visiting craftsmen.\n*An Old Time Christmas (November \u2013 December): a traditional holiday Christmas celebration with special shows, foods, and other attractions.

The district eventually introduced the 600 seat Court House Theatre in 1979. The inaugural production was ''The Chicken Thief,'' a comedy depicting the trial of a strange man named Melvin. The theatre\u2019s name has changed over the years from Courthouse to Gaslight and on to its current name. Past shows have included ''Timothy Turnbuckle\u2019s Traveling Time Machine,'' ''Hoedown,'' and ''Hatfield\u2019s Haint.'' During the Christmas season, a [[nativity play]] of the [[Nativity of Jesus]] is given.\n* The Frisco Barn\n* McHaffie's Homestead Front Porch\n* Silver Dollar Saloon \u2013 The [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] opened to the public in 1973 with [[can-can]] dancers and singing [[bartenders]]. [[Carry Nation]] brought her [[temperance movement|temperance]] union to the City to shut the house of ill repute down for good. Unfortunately for Ms. Nation, she didn't succeed. The show has changed throughout the years to include Mean Murphy, the saloon\u2019s arch enemy; Miss Tilly, the loveable yet dim-witted dance hall girl; and Choctaw Charlie and his Wild West show. The show is billed as \u201cGood clean fun.\u201d There is no cursing, chewing or spitting at the Silver Dollar and [[root beer]] is served as an alternative to [[beer]].\n* Echo Hollow Amphitheatre is an [[amphitheatre]] with seating for 4,000. The amphitheater opened in 1983 as a dinner theatre encouraging guests to stay once Silver Dollar City closed for the day. Featured shows within the amphitheater have included ''Harmonies from the Hollow,'' ''Echo Hollow Jubilee,'' ''Hotrods and Hair-dos,'' and ''GAC Country Nights.'' Each spring Silver Dollar City\u2019s Young Christian Youth Rally is held at Echo Hollow. This Rally features ministers, speakers and musical guests like [[Newsboys]], [[Kutless]] and [[Sixpence None the Richer]]. The amphitheater also hosts nationally known musical artists such as, [[Gladys Knight]], [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] and [[Ricky Skaggs]].\n* The Boatworks Theater\n* The Opera House \u2013 The 1,000 seat performance venue opened in 1994 with the Broadway-style production ''Listen to the River.'' Since its opening the theatre has played host to other large scale in-house productions including ''American Spirit,'', a patriotic musical; ''For the Glory,'' a Civil War drama; ''Headin\u2019 West,'' a musical drama about Western expansion; and ''A Dickens\u2019 Christmas Carol,'' a high-energy, musical telling of Charles Dickens\u2019 Christmas classic, ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''.\n* Pickin' Shed\n* Red Gold Heritage Hall \u2013 To commemorate Silver Dollar Citys\u2019s 40th anniversary this {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} multipurpose building opened in 2000. Themed after a turn-of-the-century tomato canning factory, the hall is capable of hosting exhibitions and shows with seating up to 1,800 guests. Festival food fills the building during events. Previously, the town of Bethlehem was recreated each Christmas season, but has since been moved to the Riverfront Playhouse in order to accommodate a stage production of ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trains|United States}}\n\n*[[List of amusement parks]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.silverdollarcity.com/ Silver Dollar City] (Official Website)\n*[http://www.dollywood.com/ Dollywood] (Official Website)\n*{{RCDB|4579}}\n\n{{HFEC}}\n{{Silver Dollar City}}\n{{Navigation Applause Award}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Silver Dollar City| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{more citations needed|date=March 2013}}\n{{Infobox amusement park\n| name = Silver Dollar City\n| image = [[File:Silver Dollar City logo.png|250px]]\n| location = [[Branson, Missouri]], U.S.\n| coordinates = {{coord|36.6671|-93.3389|display=inline,title}}\n| homepage = [https://www.silverdollarcity.com/theme-park silverdollarcity.com]\n| owner = [[Herschend Family Entertainment]]\n| general_manager = Brad Thomas\n| opening_date = {{start date and age|1960|05|01|p=yes}}\n| season = March \u2013 December\n| visitors  = 2.2 million<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.missouribusinessalert.com/industries/101911/2019/01/03/silver-dollar-city-reports-all-time-attendance-record-for-2018/ |first=Kyle |last=LaHucik|title=Silver Dollar City reports all-time attendance record for 2018|work=The Joplin Globe |date=2019-01-03 |accessdate=2019-04-08}}</ref>\n| area = {{convert|61|acre|m2}}\n| rides = 31\n| coasters = 7\n| water_rides = 4\n| restaurants = 12\n}}\n'''Silver Dollar City''' is a [[theme park]] in the US state of [[Missouri]]. Opened on May 1, 1960, the park is located between [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]] and [[Branson West, Missouri|Branson West]] off of [[Missouri Route 76]] on the Indian Point peninsula of [[Table Rock Lake]]. The park is an 1880s-themed experience that fits [[Branson, Missouri|Branson]]'s vision as a family-friendly vacation destination with down-home charm. Silver Dollar City's operating season runs from mid-March until late December, with the park closed during the months of January and February. Silver Dollar City is owned by [[Herschend Family Entertainment]].\n\n==History==\n===Marvel Cave===\n[[File:Marvel Cave.JPG|thumb|Marvel Cave entrance and rubble pile viewed from within]]\nSilver Dollar City is situated at the site of one of [[the Ozarks]]' oldest attractions, [[Marvel Cave]]. [[Henry T. Blow]], a [[lead]] mining magnate, explored the cave with six miners. They found no lead, but were convinced that the flat ceiling of one room was composed of [[marble]], they originally named the cave Marble Cave. The cave remained undisturbed until 1882 when a group led by [[T. Hodges Jones]] and [[Truman S. Powell]] entered the cave in hopes of finding lead. Jones and Powell instead found huge amounts of [[guano]] and a flat wall which they also believed to be marble. Two years later Jones bought the property and formed the Marble Cave Mining and Manufacturing Company. The company planned a town, Marble City, on the rough hilltop near the cave and in 1884 recorded a [[plat]] map at the courthouse in [[Galena, Missouri]]. By 1889 much of the guano had been mined from the cave, the marble wall proved to be [[limestone]], and no lead ore was found. The mining company ceased operation.\n\nIn 1889, William Henry Lynch, a Canadian miner and dairyman, purchased the cave and a square mile around it for $10,000 ({{Inflation|r=-3|fmt=eq|US|10000|1889}}). Lynch, with the aid of his family, proposed to open the cave to sightseers. The Lynches began operation of the sightseeing venture in 1894. The venture was not immediately profitable and was closed until Lynch raised additional capital to reopen the cave sometime after 1900. The cave has remained open since, making it one of the oldest continuously running tourist attractions in the Ozarks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\n===Herschend family===\nWhen William Lynch died in 1927, ownership of the cave passed to his daughters and the name of the cave was changed to Marvel Cave. The Lynch family operated the cave for nearly fifty years until a Chicago [[vacuum cleaner]] salesman, Hugo Herschend, purchased a 100-year lease on the cave.\n\nAfter Hugo's death his wife, Mary, took over the day-to-day operations of the venture. With the aid of her two sons, Jack and Peter, she was able to make vast improvements to the cave, including the inclusion of a [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[funicular]] railway, whose trains pulled visitors a distance of {{convert|218|ft|m}} from the depths of the cave up to the surface.\n\nOnce the railway was in operation the Herschends felt the development of the cave was complete, so they decided to create another attraction which would bring even more tourists to the cave.\n\n===New theme park===\nMary, Jack and Pete began building the 1880s Ozark village. Mary wanted authenticity and preservation as well as preserving the natural beauty of the area. The Herschends built the Ozark frontier town on the land surrounding the site of the cave. Silver Dollar City originally was the site of five shops, a church, a log cabin, and a street production reproducing the feud between the [[Hatfield-McCoy feud|Hatfields and McCoys]] several times daily.\n\nThe name was inspired by ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' script writer and publicist Don Richardson after the promotional idea of giving visitors [[Peace Dollar|silver dollars]] in change.<ref>Brothers, Michael A. \"'Ozark Jubilee': a Musical Legacy\" (March 2, 2003), ''[[Springfield News-Leader]]'', p. 1C</ref> The scenic designer for much of the original attraction was Andy Miller, who had been the set designer for the ''Jubilee'' in nearby [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]]. Opening day, May 1, 1960, included an appearance by [[Uncle Cyp and Aunt Sap Brasfield]].<ref>\"Missouri Spot Opens May 1; Draws 18,000\" (May 9, 1960), ''[[Billboard (magazine)|The Billboard]]'', p. 103</ref> The first year, Silver Dollar City drew more than 125,000 people, four times more visitors than the number that toured Marvel Cave. \"We discovered we were in the theme park business,\" Pete Herschend said.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nIn 1968, the park started charging admission.\n\nIn 1972 Genevieve Lynch, the last of William Lynch's daughters, died and she bequeathed the land under Silver Dollar City and Marvel Cave to the [[College of the Ozarks]] and Branson Presbyterian Church.<ref>Missouri Roadsides: The Traveler's Companion \u2013 Bill Earngey \u2013 University of Missouri Press (October 1995) \u2013 {{ISBN|0-8262-1021-X}}</ref> The Herschends continue to operate it.\n\nIn 1976, the Herschends purchased the Goldrush Junction theme park in [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]], which they renamed Silver Dollar City Tennessee. In 1986, the Herschends partnered with [[Dolly Parton]] and renamed the park to [[Dollywood]].\n\nSilver Dollar City expanded its entertainment over the years by adding attractions such as a stage coach ride, a steam engine train, interactive activities and various thrill rides. The park is also home to resident craftsmen who can be seen practicing their craft and exhibiting and selling their work to park visitors.\n\n===Pop culture===\nThe Clampett family of CBS-TV's ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' decided to pay a visit to Silver Dollar City (treated as an actual town, rather than a theme park) to start off the 1969\u20131970 [[season]]. The plotline involved Granny ([[Irene Ryan]]) attempting to find a husband for Elly May ([[Donna Douglas]]) back in the hills, while Jed ([[Buddy Ebsen]]) socialized with hotel clerk Shorty Kellems ([[Shug Fisher]]). They visited the blacksmith Shad Heller, soapmaker Granny Ethel Huffman, and woodcarver Peter Engler, and Miss Hathaway ([[Nancy Kulp]]) was seen in the Ozark woods. The ''Hillbillies'' were from the area surrounding Silver Dollar City and Branson, and references to Jim Owens and his White River float trip business and some Missouri mountain locations were made throughout the show's nine-year run. Five episodes of ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' were eventually shot in the park.\n\nIn 1999, Silver Dollar City was the site for the 14th annual [[Stihl Timbersports Series]] Championships. [[Jason Wynyard]], becoming the champion for the third consecutive year.\n\nOn July 5, 2007, Silver Dollar City was featured in an episode of the soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]''.\n\nOn December 5, 2007, ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'' spotlighted the park\u2019s Christmas festival, \u201cAn Old Time Christmas,\u201d and declared it as one of the top five holiday events in the country. The park was featured as part of the show\u2019s segment called \u201cGood Morning America Lights Up the Holidays.\u201d{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nFrom June 21\u201323, 2009, the park hosted the [[American Coaster Enthusiasts]]' national summer convention.\n\nThe park was featured in the book ''[[The Man Who Loved Clowns]]''.\n\n==Layout, attractions and general information==\n\n===Districts===\nSilver Dollar City is divided into ten districts.\n\n* Park Entrance\n* Main Street\n* Homestead Ridge\n* Midtown\n* Valley Road\n* The Grand Exposition\n* Riverfront\n* Wilson\u2019s Farm\n* Hugo\u2019s Hill Street\n* Fireman's Landing\n\n===Demonstrations===\n* Brown's Candy Factory\n* Carrie's Candles\n* Duplicating Lathe\n* Hazel's Blown & Cut Glass\n* Heartland Home Furnishings\n* Hillcreek Pottery\n* Mountain Leather\n* Mountain Outfitter's Knives\n* Sullivan's Mill\n* Valley Road Woodcarvers\n* Wilderness Road Blacksmith\n\n===Recurring shows===\n\n* Horsecreek Band\n* Old-Time Story Time\n* Pure Heart\n* The Homestead Pickers\n* Sons of the Silver Dollar\n\n===Rides and Attractions===\n[[File:Wildfire Silver Dollar City.jpg|thumb|WildFire]]\n<!-- Please add in alphabetical order -->\n\n===Roller Coasters===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

The Traditional Cave Tour is a one-hour guided tour through a half mile of lighted passageway. Throughout the tour, geological and historical information is explained. The Lantern Light Tour is a one and a half-hour guided tour through a little over a half mile of unlit passageway. A [[Narrow gauge railway|narrow gauge]] [[funicular]] railway is employed to take visitors from the far end of the cave back to surface level.\n* McHaffie's Homestead \u2013 a real, hewn-log cabin built in 1843.\n* Oak Trail School \u2013 a 19th-century school house where everyone is invited to pick a desk, sit down and learn about school in the 1800s.\n* Swinging Bridge\n* Wilderness Church \u2013 an old-time church with a view of the Ozark and Boston Mountains of Arkansas. Services are held on Sundays.\n\n====Former rides and attractions====\n*Sam\u2019s Minin\u2019 Shack \u2013 closed in 1968 and re-themed as Grandfather's Mansion.\n*Buzz Saw Falls \u2013 This was a [[roller coaster]] that incorporated a water type boat for the vehicle. The ride was largely promoted, however it was constantly plagued with mechanical difficulties. It was closed in 2003 and construction began to modify the ride into Powder Keg, which opened in 2005.\n*Rube Dugan's Diving Bell \u2013 This was an attraction that simulated a [[Jules Verne]]-style fantasy submarine ride, the first simulation ride of its kind. [[Walt Disney Imagineering|Disney Imagineers]] told Silver Dollar City that it would be hard to do but secretly advised them on how to create the attraction.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} It was removed in the mid-1980s to make room for the Lost River of the Ozarks, a ride that could run more people through per hour. [[Slim Pickens]] was the voice of Rube Dugan.\n* Lost River of the Ozarks \u2013 This ride was a whitewater rapids adventure using 6-person inner tube shaped boats.  Signage cautioned riders that they would get \"bathtub wet.\"  It was constructed on the former site of Rube Dugan's Diving Bell.  The Lost River of the Ozarks opened May 4, 1985 at a cost of $2 million<ref>[https://www.ky3.com/content/news/Silver-Dollar-City-fences-up-popular-ride-in-anticipation-for-something-503908691.html Silver Dollar City Closes Popular Ride in Anticipation for Something New] (January 4, 2019), ''[[KY3]]''</ref> and was demolished following the 2018 season.\n*Jim Owens Float Trip \u2013 This was an outdoor boat ride (1969 to 1980) around a man-made river with animatronics. Silver Dollar City removed this ride after the 1980 season and remodeled it into the American Plunge [[log flume]]. However, the original channels still exist and can be seen as guests make their way to Wildfire and from the queue line for American Plunge.\n*Stagecoach \u2013 In the early years of the park, an authentic stagecoach took guests on a bumpy ride around the perimeter of the town square pulled by sturdy draft horses. It was removed five years after the park opened.\n*Runaway Ore Cart \u2013 This was a small children's roller coaster that was removed after the 2004 season.\n*[[Tom Sawyer]]'s Landing \u2013 Added to the park in 1984, this play area featured rope towers and rides with Becky's Carousel as its center piece. Silver Dollar City's craftsmen hand carved each horse on the carousel. The most notable aspect of the structure were the large rope nets upon which visitors bounced and climbed.\n*[[Huck Finn]]'s Hideaway \u2013 This was a large playhouse built several stories above the ground on stilts. Visitors entered the attraction via a tiny spiral staircase built into a fake hollow tree. They had to crawl on hands and knees across a narrow bridge from the top of the hollow tree to the tree house. The exit from the attraction led visitors through an artificial cave featuring an infinite mirror illusion and Christmas lights to make it appear that they were walking through a large open space with \"stars\".\n* Waterworks Waterboggan \u2013 a flume-type water ride, mostly through a dark tunnel so the sudden turns took riders by surprise.\n* Splash Harbor \u2013 was located near the bathrooms of Geyser Gulch.\n* Geyser Gulch \u2013 This was an area built in 1997 with two large buildings. Kids could run throughout the building located by the \"lake\" and shoot each other with water guns, while dodging balls being thrown by other kids or through tubes. There were also water sprinklers outside the building where children can run through. Geyser Gulch closed on August 3, 2014 to make way for Fireman's Landing.\n\n===Festivals===\nThroughout the operating season Silver Dollar City hosts six different festivals:\n\n*Festival of Wonder (April): a spring festival showcasing unusual acts and performances.\n*Bluegrass & BBQ Festival (May): a celebration of [[bluegrass music]] and [[BBQ]] from across the nation.\n*Star-Spangled Summer (June \u2013 August): a summer festival featuring shows and activities that appeal to families with children.\n*Moonlight Madness (July 18- June 1): Ride all day and into the night on over 40 thrilling rides & attractions as you enjoy over 12 straight hours of nonstop fun for 16 straight days! \n*Southern Gospel Picnic (August \u2013 September): Gospel music is showcased during this festival along with picnic style dinners\n*Country Music days (September- September): Enjoy 13 days of concerts featuring classic country stars, plus Saturday night celebrity concerts in Echo Hollow\u00ae Amphitheatre .\n*National Harvest & Pumpkin nights (September \u2013 October): a salute to an old time [[harvest]] celebration featuring visiting craftsmen.\n*An Old Time Christmas (November \u2013 December): a traditional holiday Christmas celebration with special shows, foods, and other attractions.

The district eventually introduced the 600 seat Court House Theatre in 1979. The inaugural production was ''The Chicken Thief,'' a comedy depicting the trial of a strange man named Melvin. The theatre\u2019s name has changed over the years from Courthouse to Gaslight and on to its current name. Past shows have included ''Timothy Turnbuckle\u2019s Traveling Time Machine,'' ''Hoedown,'' and ''Hatfield\u2019s Haint.'' During the Christmas season, a [[nativity play]] of the [[Nativity of Jesus]] is given.\n* The Frisco Barn\n* McHaffie's Homestead Front Porch\n* Silver Dollar Saloon \u2013 The [[bar (establishment)|saloon]] opened to the public in 1973 with [[can-can]] dancers and singing [[bartenders]]. [[Carry Nation]] brought her [[temperance movement|temperance]] union to the City to shut the house of ill repute down for good. Unfortunately for Ms. Nation, she didn't succeed. The show has changed throughout the years to include Mean Murphy, the saloon\u2019s arch enemy; Miss Tilly, the loveable yet dim-witted dance hall girl; and Choctaw Charlie and his Wild West show. The show is billed as \u201cGood clean fun.\u201d There is no cursing, chewing or spitting at the Silver Dollar and [[root beer]] is served as an alternative to [[beer]].\n* Echo Hollow Amphitheatre is an [[amphitheatre]] with seating for 4,000. The amphitheater opened in 1983 as a dinner theatre encouraging guests to stay once Silver Dollar City closed for the day. Featured shows within the amphitheater have included ''Harmonies from the Hollow,'' ''Echo Hollow Jubilee,'' ''Hotrods and Hair-dos,'' and ''GAC Country Nights.'' Each spring Silver Dollar City\u2019s Young Christian Youth Rally is held at Echo Hollow. This Rally features ministers, speakers and musical guests like [[Newsboys]], [[Kutless]] and [[Sixpence None the Richer]]. The amphitheater also hosts nationally known musical artists such as, [[Gladys Knight]], [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Nitty Gritty Dirt Band]] and [[Ricky Skaggs]].\n* The Boatworks Theater\n* The Opera House \u2013 The 1,000 seat performance venue opened in 1994 with the Broadway-style production ''Listen to the River.'' Since its opening the theatre has played host to other large scale in-house productions including ''American Spirit,'', a patriotic musical; ''For the Glory,'' a Civil War drama; ''Headin\u2019 West,'' a musical drama about Western expansion; and ''A Dickens\u2019 Christmas Carol,'' a high-energy, musical telling of Charles Dickens\u2019 Christmas classic, ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''.\n* Pickin' Shed\n* Red Gold Heritage Hall \u2013 To commemorate Silver Dollar Citys\u2019s 40th anniversary this {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} multipurpose building opened in 2000. Themed after a turn-of-the-century tomato canning factory, the hall is capable of hosting exhibitions and shows with seating up to 1,800 guests. Festival food fills the building during events. Previously, the town of Bethlehem was recreated each Christmas season, but has since been moved to the Riverfront Playhouse in order to accommodate a stage production of ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Trains|United States}}\n\n*[[List of amusement parks]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n*[http://www.silverdollarcity.com/ Silver Dollar City] (Official Website)\n*[http://www.dollywood.com/ Dollywood] (Official Website)\n*{{RCDB|4579}}\n\n{{HFEC}}\n{{Silver Dollar City}}\n{{Navigation Applause Award}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Silver Dollar City| ]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toKY 3(link changed toKYTV (TV)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Dollar_City"}
