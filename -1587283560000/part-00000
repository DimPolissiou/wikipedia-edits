It begins with the [[Agony in the Garden]] in the [[Garden of Olives]] (or Gethsemane), the betrayal of [[Judas Iscariot]], the brutal [[Scourging at the Pillar]], the suffering of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] as prophesied by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke)|Simeon]], the crucifixion and death of Christ, and ends with a brief depiction of His [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. However, the film also has flashbacks to particular moments in Christ's life, some of which are biblically based, such as [[The Last Supper]] and [[The Sermon on the Mount]], and others that are artistic license, such as when Mary comforts Jesus and the scene where Jesus is crafting a table.\n\nIt was, for the most part, shot in Italy.<ref>[https://www.movie-locations.com/movies/p/Passion-Of-The-Christ.php. \"The Passion of the Christ\".] ''Movie-Locations''</ref> The dialogue is entirely in Hebrew, Latin, and reconstructed [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic|Aramaic]]. Although Gibson was initially against it, the film is subtitled.\n\nThe film has been controversial and received largely polarized reviews, with some critics calling the film a religious classic while others found the extreme violence distracting and excessive, and claimed that the film promoted [[antisemitism]].<ref name=EW /><ref name=tomatoes >{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/passion_of_the_christ/|title=''The Passion of the Christ'' (2004)|accessdate=July 16, 2008|website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]}}</ref><ref name=metacritic>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/video/titles/passionofthechrist|title= ''The Passion of the Christ'' (2004): reviews|accessdate=July 16, 2008|website=[[Metacritic]]}}</ref> The film grossed over $622 million worldwide<ref name=\"POTC TN\"/> and became the [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|seventh-highest-grossing film]] domestically at the end of its theatrical run.<ref name=\"BOM\"/> It is currently the highest-grossing [[Christian film industry|Christian film]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=christian.htm|title=Christian Movies at the Box Office|website=Box Office Mojo|accessdate=April 23, 2019}}</ref> It received three nominations at the [[77th Academy Awards]] in 2005, for [[Academy Award for Best Makeup|Best Makeup]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]], and [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Gibson|first=Mel|title=The Passion of the Christ|date=February 25, 2004|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0335345/awards?ref_=tt_awd|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late hours of the night at the forested garden of Gethsemane, at the height of his cause, Jesus prays while his disciples Saint Peter, James, son of Zebedee James, and John the Evangelist sleep. While he prays in seclusion, Satan appears to Jesus in an androgynous form, and tempts him, stating that no one can bear the burden that God asks of him: to suffer and die for humanity's sins. Jesus' sweat turns into blood and drips to the ground while a serpent emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call for him, and rebukes Satan by crushing the snake's head.\n\nJudas Iscariot, another of Jesus' disciples, having received a bribe of 30 pieces of silver, leads a group of temple guards to the forest and betrays Jesus' identity. As the guards arrest Jesus, a fight erupts wherein Peter draws his dagger and slashes the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus heals Malchus' injury while reprimanding Peter. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin.\n\nJohn informs Mary, mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene of the arrest, while Peter follows Jesus and his captors. Magdalene begs a passing Roman patrol to intervene, but a temple guard assures them that she is insane. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. False accusations and witnesses are brought against him. When asked by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus answers \"I am\". Caiaphas tears his robes in outrage and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus. After cursing at the mob during the third denial, Peter flees when he recalls Jesus's forewarning of his defense. A guilt-ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid in order to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by ghosts and demons, he flees the city and hangs himself.\n\nCaiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate to be condemned to death. At the urging of his wife Claudia, who knows of Jesus' status as a man of God, and after questioning Jesus and finding no fault, Pilate transfers him to the court of Herod Antipas (as Jesus is from Antipas' ruling town of Nazareth). After Jesus is found not guilty and returned, Pilate offers the crowd the choice of chastising Jesus or releasing him. He attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples' choice between Jesus and violent criminal [[Barabbas]]. The crowd demands Barabbas be freed and Jesus crucified. Attempting to appease the crowd, Pilate orders that Jesus be severely flogged. Jesus is then scourged, abused, and [[Mocking of Jesus|mocked]] by the Roman guards. They take him to a barn where they place a crown of thorns on his head and tease him saying \u201cHail, king of the Jews\u201d. A bleeding Jesus is presented before Pilate, but Caiaphas, with the crowds' encouragement, continues demanding that Jesus be crucified. Pilate washes his hands of the affair, and reluctantly orders Jesus' crucifixion. Satan observes Jesus' suffering with sadistic pleasure. \n \nAs Jesus carries a heavy wooden cross along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary, Saint Veronica a woman avoids the escort of soldiers and requests that Jesus wipe his face with her [[Veil of Veronica|cloth]], to which he consents. She offers Jesus a pot of water to drink but the guard hurls it away and dispels her. During the journey to Golgotha, Jesus is beaten by the guards until the unwilling Simon of Cyrene is forced into carrying the cross with him. At the end of their journey, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified.\n\nHanging from the cross, Jesus prays to God the Father asking forgiveness for the people who tormented him, and provides salvation to a penitent thief crucified beside him. Jesus surrenders his spirit to the Father and dies. A single droplet of rain falls from the sky to the ground, triggering an earthquake which destroys the temple and rips the veil covering the Holy of Holies in two. Satan screams in defeat from the depths of Hell. Jesus' body is taken down from the cross and entombed. Jesus [[Resurrection of Jesus|rises from the dead]] and exits the tomb resurrected, with wound holes visible on his palms.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n*[[Jim Caviezel]] as [[Jesus Christ]]\n*[[Maia Morgenstern]] as [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary, the mother of Jesus]]\n*[[Christo Jivkov]] as [[John the Apostle|John]]\n*[[Francesco De Vito]] as [[Saint Peter|Peter]]\n*[[Monica Bellucci]] as [[Mary Magdalene]]\n*[[Mattia Sbragia]] as [[Caiaphas]]\n*[[Toni Bertorelli]] as [[Annas|Annas ben Seth]]\n*[[Luca Lionello]] as [[Judas Iscariot]]\n*[[Hristo Shopov|Hristo Naumov Shopov]] as [[Pontius Pilate]]\n*[[Claudia Gerini]] as [[Saint Procula|Claudia Procles]]\n*Fabio Sartor as Abenader\n*Giacinto Ferro as [[Joseph of Arimathea]]\n*Aleksander Mincer as [[Nicodemus]]\n*Sheila Mokhtari as Woman in audience\n*[[Sergio Rubini]] as [[Saint Dismas|Dismas]]\n*Roberto Bestazoni as [[Malchus]]\n*[[Francesco Cabras]] as [[Gestas|Gesmas]]\n*Giovanni Capalbo as [[Longinus|Cassius]]\n*[[Rosalinda Celentano]] as [[Satan]]\n*[[Emilio De Marchi (actor)|Emilio De Marchi]] as Scornful Roman\n*Lello Giulivo as Brutish Roman\n*Abel Jafry as 2nd Temple officer\n*Jarreth Merz as [[Simon of Cyrene]]\n*Matt Patresi as [[Janus]]\n*Roberto Visconti as Scornful Roman\n*[[Luca De Dominicis]] as [[Herod Antipas|Herod \u00c1ntipas]]\n*Chokri Ben Zagden as [[James, son of Zebedee|James]]\n*[[Sabrina Impacciatore]] as [[St. Veronica]]\n*Pietro Sarubbi as [[Barabbas]]\n*[[Ted Rusoff]] as Chief Elder\n{{Div col end}}\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Themes==\nIn ''The Passion: Photography from the Movie \"The Passion of the Christ\"'', director Mel Gibson says, \"This is a movie about Love, Hope, Faith and forgiveness. Jesus died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more Love, Faith, Hope and forgiveness.\" The important message of ''The Passion'' is that God Loves each of us so much that He gave us His Son to suffer and die for our sins, so that we may be with Him for eternity in Heaven.\n\n==Source material==\n===New Testament===\nAccording to Mel Gibson, the primary source material for ''The Passion of the Christ'' is the four [[canonical Gospel]] narratives of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]]. The film includes a trial of [[Jesus at Herod's court]], which is only found in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Many of the utterances from Jesus in the film cannot be directly sourced to the Gospel and are part of a wider Christian narrative. The film also draws from other parts of the [[New Testament]]. One line spoken by Jesus in the film, \"I make all things new\", is found in the [[Book of Revelation]], Chapter 21, verse 5.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Holy Bible, Book of Revelation 21:5|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:5;&version=31}}</ref>\n\n===Old Testament===\nThe film also refers to the [[Old Testament]]. The film begins with an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from the [[Isaiah 53|Fourth Song of the Suffering Servant]] from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Isaiah 53:5 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:5;&version=31}}</ref> In the opening scene set in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus crushes a serpent's head in direct visual allusion to [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Genesis 3:15 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:15;&version=31}}</ref> Throughout the film, Jesus quotes from the [[Psalms]], beyond the instances recorded in the [[New Testament]].\n\n===Traditional iconography and stories===\nMany of the depictions in the film deliberately mirror traditional representations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] in art. For example, the 14 [[Stations of the Cross]] are central to the depiction of the [[Via Dolorosa]] in ''The Passion of the Christ.'' All the stations are portrayed except for the eighth station (Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem, a deleted scene on the DVD) and the fourteenth station (Jesus is laid in the tomb). Gibson was inspired by the representation of Jesus on the [[Shroud of Turin]].<ref name=\"Urbancinefile\" >{{cite web | last = Cooney Carrillo | first = Jenny | title = The Passion of Mel | publisher = Urbancinefile | date = February 26, 2004| url = http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=8559&s=Interviews }}</ref>\n\nAt the suggestion of actress [[Maia Morgenstern]], the [[Passover Seder]] is quoted early in the film. Mary asks \"Why is this night different from other nights?\", and Mary Magdalene replies with the traditional response: \"Because once we were slaves, and we are slaves no longer.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Abramowitz | first = Rachel | title = Along came Mary; Mel Gibson was sold on Maia Morgenstern for 'Passion' at first sight | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = March 7, 2004 | url = https://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/07/entertainment/ca-encounter7}}</ref>\n\nThe conflation of Mary Magdalene with the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|adulteress saved from stoning]] by Jesus has some precedent in tradition, and according to the director was done for dramatic  reasons. The names of some characters in the film are traditional and extra-Scriptural, such as the thieves crucified alongside the Christ, [[Dismas]] and Gesmas (also [[Gestas]]).\n\n===Catholic devotional writings===\nScreenwriters Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]] said that they read many accounts of Christ's Passion for inspiration, including the devotional writings of Roman Catholic mystics. A principal source is ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ''<ref name=dolorous>{{cite book | url=http://www.jesus-passion.com/DOLOROUS_PASSION_OF_OUR_LORD_JESUS_CHRIST.htm | title=The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ | author=Clement Brentano}}</ref> the visions of [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]] (1774\u20131824), as written by the poet [[Clemens Brentano]].<ref name=Corl /><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref name=Dimare /> A careful reading of Emmerich's book shows the film's high level of dependence on it.<ref name=\"Corl\"/><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref>''Movies in American History: An Encyclopedia'' edited by Philip C. DiMare 2011 {{ISBN|1-59884-296-X}} page 909</ref>\n\nHowever, Brentano's attribution of the book ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ'' to Emmerich has been subject to dispute, with allegations that Brentano wrote much of the book himself; a Vatican investigation concluding that: \"It is absolutely not certain that she ever wrote this\".<ref name=Anvil >Emmerich, Anne Catherine, and Clemens Brentano.

Because the story of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] is so well known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: \"I think it's almost counterproductive to say some of these things in a modern language. It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'\"<ref name=\"Zenit interview 2003\">{{cite news|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english| title=Mel Gibson's great passion: Christ's agony as you've never seen it|publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]]|date=March 6, 2003|accessdate=October 17, 2019|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815141913/http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english|archivedate=August 15, 2009}}</ref> The script was written in English by Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]], then [[translation|translated]] by [[William Fulco]], S.J., a professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic.

According to the DVD special feature, [[Martin Scorsese]] recently finished his film ''[[Gangs of New York]]'', and Gibson and his production designers constructed part of their set using Scorsese's set. This saved Gibson a lot of time and money.\n\nGibson's film was released on [[Ash Wednesday]], February 25, 2004.

This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] in its document ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents...Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, ''The Passion of the Christ'' retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last 40 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pawlikowski|first=John T.|title=Christian Anti-Semitism: Past History, Present Challenges Reflections in Light of Mel Gibson's ''The Passion of the Christ''|journal=Journal of Religion and Film|date=February 2004|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820085751/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|archivedate=August 20, 2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ADL itself also released a statement about the yet-to-be-released film:\n<blockquote>For filmmakers to do justice to the biblical accounts of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism.

It begins with the [[Agony in the Garden]] in the [[Garden of Olives]] (or Gethsemane), the betrayal of [[Judas Iscariot]], the brutal [[Scourging at the Pillar]], the suffering of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] as prophesied by [[Simeon (Gospel of Luke) |Simeon]], the crucifixion and death of Christ, and ends with a brief depiction of His [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]]. However, the film also has flashbacks to particular moments in Christ's life, some of which are biblically based, such as [[The Last Supper]] and [[The Sermon on the Mount]], and others that are artistic license, such as when Mary comforts Jesus and the scene where Jesus is crafting a table. \n\nIt was, for the most part, shot in Italy.<ref>[https://www.movie-locations.com/movies/p/Passion-Of-The-Christ.php. \"The Passion of the Christ\".] ''Movie-Locations''</ref> The dialogue is entirely in Hebrew, Latin, and reconstructed [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic|Aramaic]].

While he prays in seclusion, Satan appears to Jesus in an androgynous form, and tempts him, stating that no one can bear the burden that God asks of him: to suffer and die for humanity's sins. Jesus' sweat turns into blood and drips to the ground while a serpent emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call for him, and rebukes Satan by crushing the snake's head.\n\nJudas Iscariot, another of Jesus' disciples, having received a bribe of 30 pieces of silver, leads a group of temple guards to the forest and betrays Jesus' identity. As the guards arrest Jesus, a fight erupts wherein Peter draws his dagger and slashes the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus heals Malchus' injury while reprimanding Peter. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin.\n\nJohn informs Mary, mother of Jesus and Mary Magdalene of the arrest, while Peter follows Jesus and his captors. Magdalene begs a passing Roman patrol to intervene, but a temple guard assures them that she is insane. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. False accusations and witnesses are brought against him. When asked by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus answers \"I am\". Caiaphas tears his robes in outrage and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus. After cursing at the mob during the third denial, Peter flees when he recalls Jesus's forewarning of his defense. A guilt-ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid in order to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by ghosts and demons, he flees the city and hangs himself.\n\nCaiaphas brings Jesus before Pontius Pilate to be condemned to death. At the urging of his wife Claudia, who knows of Jesus' status as a man of God, and after questioning Jesus and finding no fault, Pilate transfers him to the court of Herod Antipas (as Jesus is from Antipas' ruling town of Nazareth). After Jesus is found not guilty and returned, Pilate offers the crowd the choice of chastising Jesus or releasing him. He attempts to have Jesus freed by the peoples' choice between Jesus and violent criminal [[Barabbas]]. The crowd demands Barabbas be freed and Jesus crucified. Attempting to appease the crowd, Pilate orders that Jesus be severely flogged. Jesus is then scourged, abused, and [[Mocking of Jesus|mocked]] by the Roman guards. They take him to a barn where they place a crown of thorns on his head and tease him saying \u201cHail, king of the Jews\u201d. A bleeding Jesus is presented before Pilate, but Caiaphas, with the crowds' encouragement, continues demanding that Jesus be crucified. Pilate washes his hands of the affair, and reluctantly orders Jesus' crucifixion. Satan observes Jesus' suffering with sadistic pleasure. \n \nAs Jesus carries a heavy wooden cross along the Via Dolorosa to Calvary, Saint Veronica a woman avoids the escort of soldiers and requests that Jesus wipe his face with her [[Veil of Veronica|cloth]], to which he consents. She offers Jesus a pot of water to drink but the guard hurls it away and dispels her. During the journey to Golgotha, Jesus is beaten by the guards until the unwilling Simon of Cyrene is forced into carrying the cross with him. At the end of their journey, with his mother Mary, Mary Magdalene, and others witnessing, Jesus is crucified. \n\nHanging from the cross, Jesus prays to God the Father asking forgiveness for the people who tormented him, and provides salvation to a penitent thief crucified beside him. Jesus surrenders his spirit to the Father and dies.

Jesus died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more Love, Faith, Hope and forgiveness.\" The important message of ''The Passion'' is that God Loves each of us so much that He gave us His Son to suffer and die for our sins, so that we may be with Him for eternity in Heaven.\n\n==Source material==\n===New Testament===\nAccording to Mel Gibson, the primary source material for ''The Passion of the Christ'' is the four [[canonical Gospel]] narratives of Christ's [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]]. The film includes a trial of [[Jesus at Herod's court]], which is only found in the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Many of the utterances from Jesus in the film cannot be directly sourced to the Gospel and are part of a wider Christian narrative. The film also draws from other parts of the [[New Testament]]. One line spoken by Jesus in the film, \"I make all things new\", is found in the [[Book of Revelation]], Chapter 21, verse 5.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Holy Bible, Book of Revelation 21:5|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2021:5;&version=31}}</ref>\n\n===Old Testament===\nThe film also refers to the [[Old Testament]]. The film begins with an [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from the [[Isaiah 53|Fourth Song of the Suffering Servant]] from [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Isaiah 53:5 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2053:5;&version=31}}</ref> In the opening scene set in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]], Jesus crushes a serpent's head in direct visual allusion to [[Protoevangelium|Genesis 3:15]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Holy Bible, Book of Genesis 3:15 | url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%203:15;&version=31}}</ref> Throughout the film, Jesus quotes from the [[Psalms]], beyond the instances recorded in the [[New Testament]].\n\n===Traditional iconography and stories===\nMany of the depictions in the film deliberately mirror traditional representations of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] in art. For example, the 14 [[Stations of the Cross]] are central to the depiction of the [[Via Dolorosa]] in ''The Passion of the Christ.'' All the stations are portrayed except for the eighth station (Jesus meets the women of Jerusalem, a deleted scene on the DVD) and the fourteenth station (Jesus is laid in the tomb). Gibson was inspired by the representation of Jesus on the [[Shroud of Turin]].<ref name=\"Urbancinefile\" >{{cite web | last = Cooney Carrillo | first = Jenny | title = The Passion of Mel | publisher = Urbancinefile | date = February 26, 2004| url = http://www.urbancinefile.com.au/home/view.asp?a=8559&s=Interviews }}</ref>\n\nAt the suggestion of actress [[Maia Morgenstern]], the [[Passover Seder]] is quoted early in the film. Mary asks \"Why is this night different from other nights?\", and Mary Magdalene replies with the traditional response: \"Because once we were slaves, and we are slaves no longer.\"<ref>{{cite news | last = Abramowitz | first = Rachel | title = Along came Mary; Mel Gibson was sold on Maia Morgenstern for 'Passion' at first sight | newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = March 7, 2004 | url = https://articles.latimes.com/2004/mar/07/entertainment/ca-encounter7}}</ref>\n\nThe conflation of Mary Magdalene with the [[Jesus and the woman taken in adultery|adulteress saved from stoning]] by Jesus has some precedent in tradition, and according to the director was done for dramatic  reasons. The names of some characters in the film are traditional and extra-Scriptural, such as the thieves crucified alongside the Christ, [[Dismas]] and Gesmas (also [[Gestas]]).\n\n===Catholic devotional writings===\nScreenwriters Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]] said that they read many accounts of Christ's Passion for inspiration, including the devotional writings of Roman Catholic mystics. A principal source is ''The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ''<ref name=dolorous>{{cite book | url=http://www.jesus-passion.com/DOLOROUS_PASSION_OF_OUR_LORD_JESUS_CHRIST.htm | title=The Dolorous Passion of Our Lord Jesus Christ | author=Clement Brentano}}</ref> the visions of [[Anne Catherine Emmerich]] (1774\u20131824), as written by the poet [[Clemens Brentano]].<ref name=Corl /><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref name=Dimare /> A careful reading of Emmerich's book shows the film's high level of dependence on it.<ref name=\"Corl\"/><ref name=\"Garcia\"/><ref>''Movies in American History: An Encyclopedia'' edited by Philip C.

Because the story of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] is so well known, Gibson felt the need to avoid vernacular languages in order to surprise audiences: \"I think it's almost counterproductive to say some of these things in a modern language. It makes you want to stand up and shout out the next line, like when you hear 'To be or not to be' and you instinctively say to yourself, 'That is the question.'\"<ref name=\"Zenit interview 2003\">{{cite news|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english| title=Mel Gibson's great passion: Christ's agony as you've never seen it|publisher=[[Zenit News Agency]]|date=March 6, 2003|accessdate=October 17, 2019|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815141913/http://www.zenit.org/article-6723?l=english|archivedate=August 15, 2009}}</ref> The script was written in English by Gibson and [[Benedict Fitzgerald]], then [[translation|translated]] by [[William Fulco]], S.J., a professor at Loyola Marymount University, into Latin and reconstructed Aramaic.

This saved Gibson a lot of time and money.\n\nGibson's film was released on [[Ash Wednesday]], February 25, 2004. Icon Entertainment distributed the theatrical version of the film, and [[20th Century Fox]] distributed the VHS/DVD/Blu-ray version of the film.\n\nGibson consulted several theological advisers during filming, including [[Jonathan Morris (priest)|Fr.

Afterwards, while both are holding up the cross, Jesus says to the women weeping for him, \"Do not weep for me, but for yourselves and for your children\". In the second, Pilate washes his hands, turns to Caiaphas, and says: \"Look you to it\" (i.e., the Pharisees wish to have Jesus crucified). Pilate then turns to Abanader and says: \"Do as they wish\". The scene next shows Pilate calling to his servant, who is carrying a wooden board on which Pilate writes, \"Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews\", in Latin and Hebrew. He then holds the board above his head in full view of Caiaphas, who after reading it challenges Pilate on its content. Pilate replies angrily to Caiaphas in non-subtitled Hebrew.

It must be emphasized that the main storyline presented Jesus as having been relentlessly pursued by an evil cabal of Jews, headed by the high priest [[Caiaphas]], who finally blackmailed a weak-kneed [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] into putting Jesus to death. This is precisely the storyline that fueled centuries of anti-Semitism within Christian societies. This is also a storyline rejected by the Roman Catholic Church at [[Second Vatican Council|Vatican II]] in its document ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', and by nearly all mainline Protestant churches in parallel documents...Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship, ''The Passion of the Christ'' retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last 40 years.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pawlikowski|first=John T.|title=Christian Anti-Semitism: Past History, Present Challenges Reflections in Light of Mel Gibson's ''The Passion of the Christ''|journal=Journal of Religion and Film|date=February 2004|url=http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820085751/http://www.unomaha.edu/jrf/2004Symposium/Pawlikowski.htm|archivedate=August 20, 2006}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe ADL itself also released a statement about the yet-to-be-released film:\n<blockquote>For filmmakers to do justice to the biblical accounts of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.
