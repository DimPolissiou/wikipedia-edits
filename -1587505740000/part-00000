Arguing that the political citizenship that was defined and enforced by the French Revolution was established by excluding certain categories of people from the [[social contract]], S\u00e9nac traces the progressive acceptance of non-brothers through the norm of their complementarity to enfranchised citizens, rather than their similarity to them or in recognition of any inherent rights.

Arguing that the political citizenship that was defined and enforced by the French Revolution was established by excluding certain categories of people from the [[social contract]], S\u00e9nac traces the progressive acceptance of non-brothers through the norm of their complementarity to enfranchised citizens, rather than their similarity to them or in recognition of any inherent rights.

It was serialized in ''Nemuki'' between April 2013 and February 2014 as seven separate short stories, with an eighth being added for the ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' release.  [[Viz Media]] published it in North America under its Viz Signature imprint.  The ''[[Junji Ito Collection]]'' [[anime]] anthology, which premiered in January 2018, adapts several stories from ''Fragments of Horror''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe book is a collection of eight short stories:\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Futon\"|\u5e03\u56e3|Futon}}\n::Sonoka's husband Tomio refuses to leave his [[futon]] for fear of \"dark nature spirits\" that he says are everywhere. Tomio explains that he had a [[one night stand]] with a mysterious woman who turned out to be a [[demon]], and that ever since then, he has seen the spirits everywhere he looks. One evening when Sonoka is in bed, she suddenly begins to see the spirits, as well as the demon Tomio encountered, and flees the apartment, not returning for an entire month.  When she does, she finds Tomio in a near trance-like state and still inside the futon, which is overgrown with a [[hallucinogen]]ic [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] that had been responsible for everything the two had seen.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Wooden Spirit\"|\u6728\u9020\u306e\u602a|Mokuz\u014d no Kai}}\n::Megumi's house has recently been designated a [[Tangible Cultural Property (Japan)|Tangible Cultural Property]].  One day, a woman named Manami Kino visits to see the house, hoping to see it for her architecture class.  Claiming to be enamored with the house, which she calls \"sexy\", she asks if she can board there, and Megumi's father agrees.  Eventually, the two are married.  One night, however, Megumi stumbles upon Manami rubbing herself naked against the walls of the house.  Later, she comes downstairs to find her father frantically trying to scrub away eyes which have suddenly appeared in the floorboards.  They escape as the house comes alive around them and transforms into a hideous, hairy lump.  Manami has disappeared, presumably having merged with the building, which is subsequently delisted as a national treasure.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Tomio \u2022 Red Turtleneck\"|\u5bcc\u592b\u30fb\u8d64\u3044\u30cf\u30a4\u30cd\u30c3\u30af|Tomio \u2022 Akai Hainekku}}\n::Tomio arrives at his girlfriend Sonoka's apartment begging for help.{{Efn|It is unclear whether the Tomio and Sonoka who appear in this story are the same as those who appear in the earlier story \"Futon\".}}  Three days ago, the two had broken up after Tomio began an affair with a [[Fortune-telling|fortune teller]] they had visited together.  As Tomio and the fortune teller lie in bed, she professes to be in love with his head, and asks if she can have it, proceeding to pluck one of her hairs and begin [[garrote|garroting]] him. After he makes her desist, she gives him a [[Polo neck|turtleneck]] sweater to hide the mark and takes him to see \"something good\", which turns out to be a collection of severed heads.  As Tomio flees, her hair, which was concealed in the collar of the sweater, begins to contract, cutting into his neck and forcing him to support his head with his both hands.  He explains the situation to Sonoka and she calls an ambulance; instead of an ambulance, however, the fortune teller arrives. She tortures Tomio by inserting a live [[Japanese cockroach|cockroach]] into the slit in his neck, causing Sonoka to stab her to death with a pair of scissors.  As her body disintegrates, a trio of demonic children appear and attack Tomio, calling him \"Daddy\" and asking to play.  They knock his head off, and Sonoka screams in terror, believing Tomio to be dead.  Some time later, the two awaken to find that his head is reattached, and conclude that the children must have been a hallucination. However, the memory of the incident leaves Tomio traumatized, and he continues to support his head long after the incident.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Gentle Goodbye\"|\u7de9\u3084\u304b\u306a\u5225\u308c|Yuruyakana Wakare}}\n::After her mother died when she was young, Riko has been plagued by nightmares of her father dying.  After she marries Makoto of the Tokura family, she notices that some of his older relatives are translucent, like ghosts.  He explains that they are what his family call \"afterimages\", created by the family's prayers.  The afterimages slowly fade over the course of twenty years or so, giving their grieving family members time to say goodbye, and for the deceased to bring closure to their life.  One day, ten years later, Riko sees Makoto with Ms. Mori, a woman from his office.  When she confronts him, he states that he and Mori intend to get married.  He apologizes for not telling the truth, and tells Riko that on the day of their engagement, she was struck and killed by a car, and is now an afterimage.  The next day, Riko, who is beginning to fade, leaves the Tokura household and returns to her father, intent to spend her remaining time with him.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Dissection Girl\"|\u89e3\u5256\u3061\u3083\u3093|Kaib\u014d-chan}}\n::Tatsuro Kamata is a medical student taking [[dissection]] training.  On the first day, one of the [[cadaver]]s is discovered to in fact be alive, and begs to be dissected, before fleeing the lab.  Tatsuro recognizes her as Ruriko Tamiya, who he knew as a child, and who had an unnatural fixation on [[vivisection]], forcing him to participate in her experiments and at one point even threatening to dissect him.  After she accosts him on the street, he rushes home, only to find her waiting for him with a scalpel, begging to be dissected.  Horrified, he flees as her stomach begins to deform, trying to convince himself that it is a dream.  Over the next few days, the media reports the occurrence of incidents of a similar nature, such as a man stabbing a woman in a stomach, followed by the surgeons who operated on her going insane.  Twenty years later, Tatsuro has become a doctor, and is instructing a new batch of medical students.  One of the cadavers is that of Ruriko, this time clearly dead.  However, when the students cut her open, they find her insides to be a bizarre and horrifying conglomeration of the organisms she has dissected over the years.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Blackbird\"|\u9ed2\u3044\u9ce5|Kuroi Tori}}\n::A [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]] named Kume finds a man in the forest, with both his legs broken.  At the hospital, police question the man, named Shiro Moriguchi, as to how he survived living in the wild in that condition for a month.  He claims to have rationed his food, but asks Kume to stay with him that evening.  During the night, Kume wakes up to see a strange woman in black feeding Shiro raw meat mouth-to-mouth.  When she leaves, Shiro relates how she has been feeding him this way for the entire month, keeping him alive, yet is not stopping now that he has been rescued.  The following night, she comes again, this time bearing an eyeball.  Kume chases after her, only to see her transform into a giant black bird and fly away.  Upon analyzing the meat samples, the police determine that they came from a human.  The woman does not appear again, and Shiro recovers, choosing to return to Tokyo; however, as his train leaves, Kume sees a large black bird flying after it.  Some years later, Shiro's corpse is discovered being pecked at by a bird high on [[Mount Fuji]].  His journal tells of how the woman returned, this time ripping away his flesh until he died.  DNA testing shows that the flesh which she had fed him while he was in the wild was, in fact, his own, leading Kume to surmise that she had traveled back in time to feed him his own flesh.  Going out birdwatching again, Kume is surprised to see the woman perching in a tree.  He falls, breaking his leg.  She then feeds him a mouthful of unpleasant-tasting meat.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Magami Nanakuse\"|\u4e03\u7656\u66f2\u7f8e|Nanakuse Magami}}\n::Kaoru Koketsu is a devoted fan of the novelist Magami Nanakuse, who is known for the unique \"[[tic]]s\" that she endows her characters with.  Kaoru prides herself in having tics similar to Nanakuse's characters.  After sending the author a [[fan mail|letter]], she is invited to meet her at her home, where she is unpleasantly surprised to find that Nanakuse is in fact a mean spirited, [[cross-dressing]] man, who accuses her of being a \"[[Factitious disorder|tic faker]]\".  After getting Kaoru drunk, Nanakuse throws her in a dungeon.  The writer reveals that she takes her inspiration from the tics developed by the people she keeps imprisoned there, and has hopes that Kaoru will develop one that she has never seen before.  Kaoru resolves not to move to keep from developing one.  Three days later, Nanakuse enters her cell to find that she has become paralyzed, with her face horribly distorted.  Nanakuse uses this as the basis of a novel titled ''Ultimate Tic'' before enshrining Kaoru in a glass case and donating her to the Town Association Hall.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Whispering Woman\"|\u8033\u64e6\u308a\u3059\u308b\u5973|Mimikosuri Suru Onna}}\n::Shigeki Santo's daughter Mayumi is unable to make even the smallest decisions for herself, relying on others to direct her every motion.  After losing yet another employee who could not handle the stress, a woman named Mitsu Uchida answers his ad.  She proves to be adept at instructing Mayumi, and never takes a day off, becoming very pale and gaunt in the process, all while constantly whispering in Mayumi's ear. Nevertheless, Mayumi manages to gain much confidence under the effects of Mitsu's guidance, and curious, Santo hires a detective agency to trace Mitsu's background. The agency finds that she is living with an abusive man named Aga who has forced her to apply for the high-paying job so she can support him.  One day, Mitsu is found beaten to death.  However, Mayumi continues to function normally, believing that Mitsu is still with her, and even Santo sometimes believes that he can still hear her whispering in his daughter's ear.  Then, one night, Mayumi returns home covered in blood, claiming to have killed Aga on Mitsu's instructions.\n\n==Conception and development==\nPrior to the publication of ''Fragments of Horror'', [[Junji Ito]] had not written [[Horror fiction|horror]] [[manga]] for eight years; his last published collection in the genre was ''Shin Yami no Koe Kaidan'' in 2006.<ref name=\"CBR\">{{cite web |url=http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2014/12/viz-media-to-publish-junji-itos-fragments-of-horror/ |title=Viz Media to publish Junji Ito\u2019s \u2018Fragments of Horror\u2019 |last=Melrose |first=Kevin |date=July 8, 2014 |website=[[Comic Book Resources]] |accessdate=December 15, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.com/comics/news/a615579/junji-itos-fragments-of-horror-coming-to-viz-media/ |title=Junji Ito's Fragments of Horror coming to Viz Media |last=Armitage |first=Hugh |date=December 9, 2014 |website=[[Digital Spy]] |accessdate=March 26, 2016 }}</ref><ref name=\"Afterword\">{{cite book |last=Ito |first=Junji |author-link=Junji Ito |date=June 16, 2015 |chapter=Afterword |title=Fragments of Horror |publisher=[[Viz Media]] |publication-date=June 16, 2015 |page=222 |isbn=978-1-4215-8079-1 }}</ref>  Ito wrote that \"during those eight years, I was doing plenty of work on illustrations and [[Junji Ito's Cat Diary: Yon & Mu|manga about cats]] or about society, but even taking that into account, the time seems too empty somehow.

He also opined that the book contained several instant classics, and was particularly struck by \"Blackbird\", which he called \"the standout hit\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/fragments-of-horror-delivers-more-junji-ito-manga-frights/ |title=Fragments of Horror Delivers More Junji Ito Manga Frights |last=Luster |first=Joseph |date=June 30, 2015 |website=[[Otaku USA]] |accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nNick Creamer of [[Anime News Network]] praised Ito for his attempts at finding horror in unexpected places, but felt that it was not uniformly successful.  He noted how Ito's stories tried to subvert familiarity and thus evoke horror, but opined that doing so caused the stories in the collection to walk the \"line between the horrifying and the absurd\".  He praised Ito's \"detailed, unnerving\" art, but also felt that sometimes Ito used it to prop up an overall weak story with \"one shocking full-page panel\".  His one critique of the art was that it tended toward being too formal and thus sometimes lacked personality.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/fragments-of-horror/gn-1/.91271 |title=Fragments of Horror GN 1 - Review |last=Creamer |first=Nick |date=August 8, 2015 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn her review for ''[[Fangoria]]'', Svetlana Fedotov called the collection a good entry point for new fans that would also satisfy longtime Ito readers.  Like many other reviewers, she noticed several [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian]] influences in the work, and praised Ito for his \"innate knack for bringing out the menace in the most innocent of objects.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/fragment-of-horror-comic-book-review/ |title=''Fragments of Horror'' (Comic Book Review) |last=Fedotov |first=Svetlana |date=June 30, 2015 |website=[[Fangoria]] |accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nChris Randle of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the series a mostly positive review.  He noted that Ito usually avoided being \"political\" in his stories, and also compared the collection to a toned down version of the [[ero guro]] art movement.  Ultimately, he concluded that Ito liked to write stories that were less personal and more fascinated with things beyond comprehension, like Lovecraft but without the latter's political views.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/23/fragments-of-horror-junji-ito-review-tales-from-a-dungeon-deranged-prisoners |title=Fragments of Horror by Junji Ito review - tales from a dungeon's deranged inmates |last=Randle |first=Chris |date=July 23, 2015 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=January 6, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn an in-depth review for ''[[The Comics Journal]]'', Joe McCulloch opined that the collection was hardly representative of Ito's best work, with only \"Whispering Woman\" standing out from the others artistically, yet contained interesting shared themes across many of its stories.  He made note of how most of the interesting characters in the collection were female - either put-upon protagonists or powerful, liberated, and uncaring antagonists, while the majority of male characters were either treacherous or dull.  In his eyes, the common narrative across the collection was one of women confronted by the faithlessness of their male partners and then offered liberation through the actions or example of the consistently female supernatural antagonist.  Ultimately, however, McCulloch felt that these themes were not genuine, but rather a slightly cynical attempt to profit from a magazine with a primarily female audience, a motive that he saw as being satirized in the self-aware \"Magami Nanakuse\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcj.com/reviews/fragments-of-horror/ |title=Fragments of Horror |last=McCulloch |first=Joe |date=July 8, 2015 |website=[[The Comics Journal]] |accessdate=January 6, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nZainab Akhtar of [[Comics & Cola]] also noted the focus on stories of women betrayed by men and empowered female villains.  However, she felt that collection was a poorer imitation of his earlier works, \"Ito trying to do Ito, and not quite succeeding.\"  She attributed this to the fact that, while his art maintained its signature horror, the stories failed to connect with the reader on an emotional level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsandcola.com/2015/08/fragments-of-horror-sees-junji-ito-make.html |title=Fragments of Horror sees Junji Ito make an uneven return to the genre [review] |last=Akhtar |first=Zainab |date=August 5, 2015 |website=[[Comics & Cola]] |accessdate=January 6, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, a review in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' considered the frequent use of female antagonists to be sexist, as they felt it fell into the \"evil woman\" trope.  They also felt that the stories were subpar, but believed the quality of the art compensated for any failings.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4215-8079-1 |title=Comic Book Review: Fragments of Horror |date=May 18, 2015 |website=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=January 6, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nShelly Atomic of [[Comics Bulletin]] found the collection to be a mix of good and below average stories.  She criticized \"Tomio \u2022 Red Turtleneck\" and \"Futon\" for being directionless, but praised \"Blackbird\" and \"Gentle Goodbye\", the one for a \"great twist\" and the other for its \"surprisingly heartfelt and sweat [sic] story\", feeling that they showed that Ito still retained the creative energy that defined his early works.  She also praised the print quality of the volume, noting that the cover and paper was much higher quality than a standard manga.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comicsbulletin.com/keeping-it-ghastly-fragments-of-horror/ |title=Keeping It Ghastly: Fragments of Horror |last=Atomic |first=Shelly |date=November 20, 2015 |website=[[Comics Bulletin]] |accessdate=January 6, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nA number of reviewers have compared the cover of the anthology to [[Edvard Munch]]'s painting ''[[The Scream]]''.<ref name=\"bleeding cool\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/06/15/junji-itos-return-to-cosmic-terror-in-fragments-of-horror-look-it-moves-by-adi-tantimedh/ |title=Junji Ito\u2019s Return to Cosmic Terror in Fragments of Horror |last=Johnston |first=Rich |author-link=Rich Johnston |date=June 15, 2015 |website=[[Bleeding Cool News]] |accessdate=March 26, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fandompost.com/2015/09/13/fragments-of-horror-manga-review/ |title=Fragments of Horror Manga Review |last=Warner |first=Matthew |date=September 13, 2015 |website=The Fandom Post |accessdate=March 26, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{ANN|manga|16990}}\n\n{{Junji Ito}}\n\n[[Category:Asahi Sonorama manga]]\n[[Category:Horror anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014djo manga]]\n[[Category:Viz Media manga]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Fragments of Horror\n| image           = Fragments of Horror.png\n| caption         = Cover of the manga anthology. {{efn|A number of reviewers have commented on its similarity to [[Edvard Munch]]'s painting ''[[The Scream]]''.}}\n| ja_kanji        = \u9b54\u306e\u65ad\u7247\n| ja_romaji       = Ma no Kakera\n| genre           = [[Horror fiction|Horror]]<ref name=\"CR\">{{cite web |url=http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2014/12/03/viz-media-licenses-junji-itos-fragment-of-horror-manga |title=Viz Media Licenses Junji Ito's \"Fragment of Horror\" Manga |last=Luster |first=Joseph |date=15 December 2015 |website=[[Crunchyroll]] |accessdate=15 December 2015 }}</ref><!-- Note: Use and cite reliable sources to identify genre/s, not personal interpretation.

It was serialized in ''Nemuki'' between April 2013 and February 2014 as seven separate short stories, with an eighth being added for the ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' release.  [[Viz Media]] published it in North America under its Viz Signature imprint.  The ''[[Junji Ito Collection]]'' [[anime]] anthology, which premiered in January 2018, adapts several stories from ''Fragments of Horror''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe book is a collection of eight short stories:\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Futon\"|\u5e03\u56e3|Futon}}\n::Sonoka's husband Tomio refuses to leave his [[futon]] for fear of \"dark nature spirits\" that he says are everywhere. Tomio explains that he had a [[one night stand]] with a mysterious woman who turned out to be a [[demon]], and that ever since then, he has seen the spirits everywhere he looks. One evening when Sonoka is in bed, she suddenly begins to see the spirits, as well as the demon Tomio encountered, and flees the apartment, not returning for an entire month.  When she does, she finds Tomio in a near trance-like state and still inside the futon, which is overgrown with a [[hallucinogen]]ic [[mold]] that had been responsible for everything the two had seen.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Wooden Spirit\"|\u6728\u9020\u306e\u602a|Mokuz\u014d no Kai}}\n::Megumi's house has recently been designated a [[Tangible Cultural Property (Japan)|Tangible Cultural Property]].  One day, a woman named Manami Kino visits to see the house, hoping to see it for her architecture class.  Claiming to be enamored with the house, which she calls \"sexy\", she asks if she can board there, and Megumi's father agrees.  Eventually, the two are married.  One night, however, Megumi stumbles upon Manami rubbing herself naked against the walls of the house.  Later, she comes downstairs to find her father frantically trying to scrub away eyes which have suddenly appeared in the floorboards.  They escape as the house comes alive around them and transforms into a hideous, hairy lump.  Manami has disappeared, presumably having merged with the building, which is subsequently delisted as a national treasure.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Tomio \u2022 Red Turtleneck\"|\u5bcc\u592b\u30fb\u8d64\u3044\u30cf\u30a4\u30cd\u30c3\u30af|Tomio \u2022 Akai Hainekku}}\n::Tomio arrives at his girlfriend Sonoka's apartment begging for help.{{Efn|It is unclear whether the Tomio and Sonoka who appear in this story are the same as those who appear in the earlier story \"Futon\".}}  Three days ago, the two had broken up after Tomio began an affair with a [[Fortune-telling|fortune teller]] they had visited together.  As Tomio and the fortune teller lie in bed, she professes to be in love with his head, and asks if she can have it, proceeding to pluck one of her hairs and begin [[garrote|garroting]] him. After he makes her desist, she gives him a [[Polo neck|turtleneck]] sweater to hide the mark and takes him to see \"something good\", which turns out to be a collection of severed heads.  As Tomio flees, her hair, which was concealed in the collar of the sweater, begins to contract, cutting into his neck and forcing him to support his head with his both hands.  He explains the situation to Sonoka and she calls an ambulance; instead of an ambulance, however, the fortune teller arrives. She tortures Tomio by inserting a live [[Japanese cockroach|cockroach]] into the slit in his neck, causing Sonoka to stab her to death with a pair of scissors.  As her body disintegrates, a trio of demonic children appear and attack Tomio, calling him \"Daddy\" and asking to play.  They knock his head off, and Sonoka screams in terror, believing Tomio to be dead.  Some time later, the two awaken to find that his head is reattached, and conclude that the children must have been a hallucination. However, the memory of the incident leaves Tomio traumatized, and he continues to support his head long after the incident.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Gentle Goodbye\"|\u7de9\u3084\u304b\u306a\u5225\u308c|Yuruyakana Wakare}}\n::After her mother died when she was young, Riko has been plagued by nightmares of her father dying.  After she marries Makoto of the Tokura family, she notices that some of his older relatives are translucent, like ghosts.  He explains that they are what his family call \"afterimages\", created by the family's prayers.  The afterimages slowly fade over the course of twenty years or so, giving their grieving family members time to say goodbye, and for the deceased to bring closure to their life.  One day, ten years later, Riko sees Makoto with Ms. Mori, a woman from his office.  When she confronts him, he states that he and Mori intend to get married.  He apologizes for not telling the truth, and tells Riko that on the day of their engagement, she was struck and killed by a car, and is now an afterimage.  The next day, Riko, who is beginning to fade, leaves the Tokura household and returns to her father, intent to spend her remaining time with him.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Dissection Girl\"|\u89e3\u5256\u3061\u3083\u3093|Kaib\u014d-chan}}\n::Tatsuro Kamata is a medical student taking [[dissection]] training.  On the first day, one of the [[cadaver]]s is discovered to in fact be alive, and begs to be dissected, before fleeing the lab.  Tatsuro recognizes her as Ruriko Tamiya, who he knew as a child, and who had an unnatural fixation on [[vivisection]], forcing him to participate in her experiments and at one point even threatening to dissect him.  After she accosts him on the street, he rushes home, only to find her waiting for him with a scalpel, begging to be dissected.  Horrified, he flees as her stomach begins to deform, trying to convince himself that it is a dream.  Over the next few days, the media reports the occurrence of incidents of a similar nature, such as a man stabbing a woman in a stomach, followed by the surgeons who operated on her going insane.  Twenty years later, Tatsuro has become a doctor, and is instructing a new batch of medical students.  One of the cadavers is that of Ruriko, this time clearly dead.  However, when the students cut her open, they find her insides to be a bizarre and horrifying conglomeration of the organisms she has dissected over the years.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Blackbird\"|\u9ed2\u3044\u9ce5|Kuroi Tori}}\n::A [[Birdwatching|birdwatcher]] named Kume finds a man in the forest, with both his legs broken.  At the hospital, police question the man, named Shiro Moriguchi, as to how he survived living in the wild in that condition for a month.  He claims to have rationed his food, but asks Kume to stay with him that evening.  During the night, Kume wakes up to see a strange woman in black feeding Shiro raw meat mouth-to-mouth.  When she leaves, Shiro relates how she has been feeding him this way for the entire month, keeping him alive, yet is not stopping now that he has been rescued.  The following night, she comes again, this time bearing an eyeball.  Kume chases after her, only to see her transform into a giant black bird and fly away.  Upon analyzing the meat samples, the police determine that they came from a human.  The woman does not appear again, and Shiro recovers, choosing to return to Tokyo; however, as his train leaves, Kume sees a large black bird flying after it.  Some years later, Shiro's corpse is discovered being pecked at by a bird high on [[Mount Fuji]].  His journal tells of how the woman returned, this time ripping away his flesh until he died.  DNA testing shows that the flesh which she had fed him while he was in the wild was, in fact, his own, leading Kume to surmise that she had traveled back in time to feed him his own flesh.  Going out birdwatching again, Kume is surprised to see the woman perching in a tree.  He falls, breaking his leg.  She then feeds him a mouthful of unpleasant-tasting meat.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Magami Nanakuse\"|\u4e03\u7656\u66f2\u7f8e|Nanakuse Magami}}\n::Kaoru Koketsu is a devoted fan of the novelist Magami Nanakuse, who is known for the unique \"[[tic]]s\" that she endows her characters with.  Kaoru prides herself in having tics similar to Nanakuse's characters.  After sending the author a [[fan mail|letter]], she is invited to meet her at her home, where she is unpleasantly surprised to find that Nanakuse is in fact a mean spirited, [[cross-dressing]] man, who accuses her of being a \"[[Factitious disorder|tic faker]]\".  After getting Kaoru drunk, Nanakuse throws her in a dungeon.  The writer reveals that she takes her inspiration from the tics developed by the people she keeps imprisoned there, and has hopes that Kaoru will develop one that she has never seen before.  Kaoru resolves not to move to keep from developing one.  Three days later, Nanakuse enters her cell to find that she has become paralyzed, with her face horribly distorted.  Nanakuse uses this as the basis of a novel titled ''Ultimate Tic'' before enshrining Kaoru in a glass case and donating her to the Town Association Hall.\n\n* {{Nihongo|\"Whispering Woman\"|\u8033\u64e6\u308a\u3059\u308b\u5973|Mimikosuri Suru Onna}}\n::Shigeki Santo's daughter Mayumi is unable to make even the smallest decisions for herself, relying on others to direct her every motion.  After losing yet another employee who could not handle the stress, a woman named Mitsu Uchida answers his ad.  She proves to be adept at instructing Mayumi, and never takes a day off, becoming very pale and gaunt in the process, all while constantly whispering in Mayumi's ear. Nevertheless, Mayumi manages to gain much confidence under the effects of Mitsu's guidance, and curious, Santo hires a detective agency to trace Mitsu's background. The agency finds that she is living with an abusive man named Aga who has forced her to apply for the high-paying job so she can support him.  One day, Mitsu is found beaten to death.  However, Mayumi continues to function normally, believing that Mitsu is still with her, and even Santo sometimes believes that he can still hear her whispering in his daughter's ear.

He also opined that the book contained several instant classics, and was particularly struck by \"Blackbird\", which he called \"the standout hit\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/fragments-of-horror-delivers-more-junji-ito-manga-frights/ |title=Fragments of Horror Delivers More Junji Ito Manga Frights |last=Luster |first=Joseph |date=June 30, 2015 |website=[[Otaku USA]] |accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nNick Creamer of [[Anime News Network]] praised Ito for his attempts at finding horror in unexpected places, but felt that it was not uniformly successful.  He noted how Ito's stories tried to subvert familiarity and thus evoke horror, but opined that doing so caused the stories in the collection to walk the \"line between the horrifying and the absurd\".  He praised Ito's \"detailed, unnerving\" art, but also felt that sometimes Ito used it to prop up an overall weak story with \"one shocking full-page panel\".  His one critique of the art was that it tended toward being too formal and thus sometimes lacked personality.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/fragments-of-horror/gn-1/.91271 |title=Fragments of Horror GN 1 - Review |last=Creamer |first=Nick |date=August 8, 2015 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn her review for ''[[Fangoria]]'', Svetlana Fedotov called the collection a good entry point for new fans that would also satisfy longtime Ito readers.  Like many other reviewers, she noticed several [[Lovecraftian horror|Lovecraftian]] influences in the work, and praised Ito for his \"innate knack for bringing out the menace in the most innocent of objects.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fangoria.com/new/fragment-of-horror-comic-book-review/ |title=''Fragments of Horror'' (Comic Book Review) |last=Fedotov |first=Svetlana |date=June 30, 2015 |website=[[Fangoria]] |accessdate=December 4, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nChris Randle of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the series a mostly positive review.  He noted that Ito usually avoided being \"political\" in his stories, and also compared the collection to a toned down version of the [[ero guro]] art movement.  Ultimately, he concluded that Ito liked to write stories that were less personal and more fascinated with things beyond comprehension, like Lovecraft but without the latter's political views.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jul/23/fragments-of-horror-junji-ito-review-tales-from-a-dungeon-deranged-prisoners |title=Fragments of Horror by Junji Ito review - tales from a dungeon's deranged inmates |last=Randle |first=Chris |date=July 23, 2015 |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=January 6, 2017 }}</ref>\n\nIn an in-depth review for ''[[The Comics Journal]]'', Joe McCulloch opined that the collection was hardly representative of Ito's best work, with only \"Whispering Woman\" standing out from the others artistically, yet contained interesting shared themes across many of its stories.  He made note of how most of the interesting characters in the collection were female - either put-upon protagonists or powerful, liberated, and uncaring antagonists, while the majority of male characters were either treacherous or dull.  In his eyes, the common narrative across the collection was one of women confronted by the faithlessness of their male partners and then offered liberation through the actions or example of the consistently female supernatural antagonist.  Ultimately, however, McCulloch felt that these themes were not genuine, but rather a slightly cynical attempt to profit from a magazine with a primarily female audience, a motive that he saw as being satirized in the self-aware \"Magami Nanakuse\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcj.com/reviews/fragments-of-horror/ |title=Fragments of Horror |last=McCulloch |first=Joe |date=July 8, 2015 |website=[[The Comics Journal]] |accessdate=January 6, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nZainab Akhtar of [[Comics & Cola]] also noted the focus on stories of women betrayed by men and empowered female villains.  However, she felt that collection was a poorer imitation of his earlier works, \"Ito trying to do Ito, and not quite succeeding.\"  She attributed this to the fact that, while his art maintained its signature horror, the stories failed to connect with the reader on an emotional level.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicsandcola.com/2015/08/fragments-of-horror-sees-junji-ito-make.html |title=Fragments of Horror sees Junji Ito make an uneven return to the genre [review] |last=Akhtar |first=Zainab |date=August 5, 2015 |website=[[Comics & Cola]] |accessdate=January 6, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nIn contrast, a review in ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' considered the frequent use of female antagonists to be sexist, as they felt it fell into the \"evil woman\" trope.  They also felt that the stories were subpar, but believed the quality of the art compensated for any failings.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4215-8079-1 |title=Comic Book Review: Fragments of Horror |date=May 18, 2015 |website=[[Publishers Weekly]] |accessdate=January 6, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nShelly Atomic of [[Comics Bulletin]] found the collection to be a mix of good and below average stories.  She criticized \"Tomio \u2022 Red Turtleneck\" and \"Futon\" for being directionless, but praised \"Blackbird\" and \"Gentle Goodbye\", the one for a \"great twist\" and the other for its \"surprisingly heartfelt and sweat [sic] story\", feeling that they showed that Ito still retained the creative energy that defined his early works.  She also praised the print quality of the volume, noting that the cover and paper was much higher quality than a standard manga.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://comicsbulletin.com/keeping-it-ghastly-fragments-of-horror/ |title=Keeping It Ghastly: Fragments of Horror |last=Atomic |first=Shelly |date=November 20, 2015 |website=[[Comics Bulletin]] |accessdate=January 6, 2018 }}</ref>\n\nA number of reviewers have compared the cover of the anthology to [[Edvard Munch]]'s painting ''[[The Scream]]''.<ref name=\"bleeding cool\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/06/15/junji-itos-return-to-cosmic-terror-in-fragments-of-horror-look-it-moves-by-adi-tantimedh/ |title=Junji Ito\u2019s Return to Cosmic Terror in Fragments of Horror |last=Johnston |first=Rich |author-link=Rich Johnston |date=June 15, 2015 |website=[[Bleeding Cool News]] |accessdate=March 26, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fandompost.com/2015/09/13/fragments-of-horror-manga-review/ |title=Fragments of Horror Manga Review |last=Warner |first=Matthew |date=September 13, 2015 |website=The Fandom Post |accessdate=March 26, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{ANN|manga|16990}}\n\n{{Junji Ito}}\n\n[[Category:Asahi Sonorama manga]]\n[[Category:Horror anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Sh\u014djo manga]]\n[[Category:Viz Media manga]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toMold(link changed toMold (fungus)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragments_of_Horror"}

Since 1944 it has served as the primary training center for the [[Apostolic Church of Pentecost]] (ACOP) and welcomes students from across Canada and around the world.  In a rural setting, Eston College provides an educational and discipleship setting that \"allows you to learn more about yourself, your world, and your creator.\"<ref name=About>[http://estoncollege.ca/#/welcome/about-us About us], Eston College</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\nIn 1944 at a Trossachs Camp meeting a meeting was called to discuss the location and operation of a Bible school that would serve the churches in the [[Apostolic Church of Pentecost|ACOP]], which at the time was called the \"Full Gospel Missions Fellowship\".<ref>Wegner p. 65-68</ref> At this meeting five men were appointed to carry out the work of starting a Bible college for the fellowship. The five men on this Committee were [[G. S. McLean|Glen McLean]], Lorne Pritchard, Ron Burnside, Elmer Powers, and Harold Hollands.<ref>''Prairie Fire'' p. 7</ref>\n\nThese five men built the foundation for the Full Gospel Bible Institute (FGBI) that opened its doors on November 6, 1944 welcoming six students.<ref name=History>[http://storage.cloversites.com/estoncollege/documents/History_2.pdf History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708165302/http://storage.cloversites.com/estoncollege/documents/History_2.pdf |date=2011-07-08 }}, Eston College</ref> Eston was chosen as the location for the Bible School after a number of locations were considered. Some of these were [[Pangman, Saskatchwan|Pangman SK]], [[Trossachs, Saskatchwan|Trossachs SK]], and Eston SK. \"G. S. McLean's presence at Eston and the local churches willingness to donate a site at Eston may have been factors that tipped the scales.\" <ref>Larden p. 125</ref>\n\n===History===\nSituated in the far south-east corner of the small farming community, Eston College began with an old farm house and use of the Eston Full Gospel Church on the other side of town. The student body grew quickly and by the second term of 1944-45 school year there were 18 students registered. During the early years G. S. McLean was the Principal with Rev. W. B. Marshall and his wife serving as teachers, the registrar, and the secretary. The early years depended upon adjunct faculty such as Lorne Pritchard, Ern Baxter, and Albert Marshall. The Bible education received in these early years set a precedent for the future of FGBI.<ref>''Prairie Fire'' pp. 7-13</ref>\n\nIn a meeting in Eston on October 8, 1953 the governing bodies of FGBI and the [[Apostolic Missionary Training Institute]] (AMTI) met for the final time to complete the merger of the two Bible schools. The two church fellowships of the [[Apostolic Church of Pentecost|ACOP]] and the [[Christian Ministers' Association#History|Evangelical Churches of Pentecost]] were already undergoing talks of a merger and it was deemed unnecessary to have two Bible schools. It was decided that AMTI would close down and the students would be transferred to FGBI.<ref>''Prairie Fire'' pp. 19-22</ref><ref>Larden p. 129</ref>\n\nG. S. McLean served at the president of FGBI for 39 years<ref name=History/> and saw the small prairie Bible school grow from 6 students in its inaugural year to a peak that stands to this day of 187 students in 1976. During this time FGBI also saw its campus develop and other departments open within the institution. Notably FGBI Press, Summer Institute of Missions, the A. D. Marshall Library, The Bible and Science Department, and was host to numerous conferences and gatherings.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn April 1983 the Board of Directors of FGBI appointed Rev. Alan Mortensen as president and Willard Mitchell as Vice President. Although G. S. McLean retired as president he became Chancellor of the Full Gospel Bible Institute until his death in 2000. Alan Mortensen would lead FGBI through the next 12 years seeing growth and change take place as time progressed through the eighties and nineties. During Alan Mortensen's tenure as president there was a devastating fire that destroyed the chapel which led to further campus development, there were new ministry opportunities that were made available, a flag was adopted for the institution, and growth was to take place after an enrolment low in 1986 with 97 students.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn 1997 the College Board of Directors appointed Todd Atkinson, as President. During Atkinson's time at FGBI there was significant campus development and a newly recognized desire to see the School move toward accreditation so it could offer degrees and transferable credit.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn 1999 Lauren Miller was appointed president. During the 10 years that Lauren Miller was president FGBI changed its name to The Full Gospel Bible College in October 2005, and then again to Eston College in May 2007. The college started to grant Bachelor of Biblical Studies Degrees in 2000 offering diploma upgrades to previous graduates (see academics) and currently enrolled students a 4-year bachelors program. Miller guided the college through the eight-year accreditation process with the Association for Biblical Higher Education with the college receiving full 5 year initial accreditation in May 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Brian Fuller was appointed president. Since then, the college has eliminated its debt and improved its facilities. Fuller guided the college through ABHE accreditation and in 2012 the college was given an ABHE recommendation for 10 years. New programs have been added under Fuller's presidency. GOdiscipleship, introduced in 2009, credits students for biblical studies and ministry trips to the poor and disadvantaged. A program called Martyer's Life began in 2012, focusing on students learning first hand the gifts and offices of the Holy Spirit, such as evangelism, healing, the prophetic, etc. The 'Gideon's Call' program, also created in 2012, focuses on the role of music ministry both inside and outside the church body. Finally, an IT program was added in 2013 where students enrolled in biblical studies can also learn how to manage media to further promote the gospel.<ref name=Academics />\n\n===Presidents of Eston College===\nThere have been five presidents of Eston College <ref name=History/>\n*Dr. G.

Since 1944 it has served as the primary training center for the [[Apostolic Church of Pentecost]] (ACOP) and welcomes students from across Canada and around the world.  In a rural setting, Eston College provides an educational and discipleship setting that \"allows you to learn more about yourself, your world, and your creator.\"<ref name=About>[http://estoncollege.ca/#/welcome/about-us About us], Eston College</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Founding===\nIn 1944 at a Trossachs Camp meeting a meeting was called to discuss the location and operation of a Bible school that would serve the churches in the [[Apostolic Church of Pentecost|ACOP]], which at the time was called the \"Full Gospel Missions Fellowship\".<ref>Wegner p. 65-68</ref> At this meeting five men were appointed to carry out the work of starting a Bible college for the fellowship. The five men on this Committee were [[G. S. McLean|Glen McLean]], Lorne Pritchard, Ron Burnside, Elmer Powers, and Harold Hollands.<ref>''Prairie Fire'' p. 7</ref>\n\nThese five men built the foundation for the Full Gospel Bible Institute (FGBI) that opened its doors on November 6, 1944 welcoming six students.<ref name=History>[http://storage.cloversites.com/estoncollege/documents/History_2.pdf History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708165302/http://storage.cloversites.com/estoncollege/documents/History_2.pdf |date=2011-07-08 }}, Eston College</ref> Eston was chosen as the location for the Bible School after a number of locations were considered. Some of these were [[Pangman, Saskatchwan|Pangman SK]], [[Trossachs, Saskatchwan|Trossachs SK]], and Eston SK. \"G. S. McLean's presence at Eston and the local churches willingness to donate a site at Eston may have been factors that tipped the scales.\" <ref>Larden p. 125</ref>\n\n===History===\nSituated in the far south-east corner of the small farming community, Eston College began with an old farm house and use of the Eston Full Gospel Church on the other side of town. The student body grew quickly and by the second term of 1944-45 school year there were 18 students registered. During the early years G. S. McLean was the Principal with Rev. W. B. Marshall and his wife serving as teachers, the registrar, and the secretary. The early years depended upon adjunct faculty such as Lorne Pritchard, Ern Baxter, and Albert Marshall. The Bible education received in these early years set a precedent for the future of FGBI.<ref>''Prairie Fire'' pp. 7-13</ref>\n\nIn a meeting in Eston on October 8, 1953 the governing bodies of FGBI and the [[Apostolic Missionary Training Institute]] (AMTI) met for the final time to complete the merger of the two Bible schools. The two church fellowships of the [[Apostolic Church of Pentecost|ACOP]] and the [[Christian Ministers' Association#History|Evangelical Churches of Pentecost]] were already undergoing talks of a merger and it was deemed unnecessary to have two Bible schools. It was decided that AMTI would close down and the students would be transferred to FGBI.<ref>''Prairie Fire'' pp. 19-22</ref><ref>Larden p. 129</ref>\n\nG. S. McLean served at the president of FGBI for 39 years<ref name=History/> and saw the small prairie Bible school grow from 6 students in its inaugural year to a peak that stands to this day of 187 students in 1976. During this time FGBI also saw its campus develop and other departments open within the institution. Notably FGBI Press, Summer Institute of Missions, the A. D. Marshall Library, The Bible and Science Department, and was host to numerous conferences and gatherings.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn April 1983 the Board of Directors of FGBI appointed Rev. Alan Mortensen as president and Willard Mitchell as Vice President. Although G. S. McLean retired as president he became Chancellor of the Full Gospel Bible Institute until his death in 2000. Alan Mortensen would lead FGBI through the next 12 years seeing growth and change take place as time progressed through the eighties and nineties. During Alan Mortensen's tenure as president there was a devastating fire that destroyed the chapel which led to further campus development, there were new ministry opportunities that were made available, a flag was adopted for the institution, and growth was to take place after an enrolment low in 1986 with 97 students.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn 1997 the College Board of Directors appointed Todd Atkinson, as President. During Atkinson's time at FGBI there was significant campus development and a newly recognized desire to see the School move toward accreditation so it could offer degrees and transferable credit.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}\n\nIn 1999 Lauren Miller was appointed president. During the 10 years that Lauren Miller was president FGBI changed its name to The Full Gospel Bible College in October 2005, and then again to Eston College in May 2007. The college started to grant Bachelor of Biblical Studies Degrees in 2000 offering diploma upgrades to previous graduates (see academics) and currently enrolled students a 4-year bachelors program. Miller guided the college through the eight-year accreditation process with the Association for Biblical Higher Education with the college receiving full 5 year initial accreditation in May 2007.\n\nIn 2008, Brian Fuller was appointed president. Since then, the college has eliminated its debt and improved its facilities. Fuller guided the college through ABHE accreditation and in 2012 the college was given an ABHE recommendation for 10 years. New programs have been added under Fuller's presidency. GOdiscipleship, introduced in 2009, credits students for biblical studies and ministry trips to the poor and disadvantaged. A program called Martyer's Life began in 2012, focusing on students learning first hand the gifts and offices of the Holy Spirit, such as evangelism, healing, the prophetic, etc. The 'Gideon's Call' program, also created in 2012, focuses on the role of music ministry both inside and outside the church body. Finally, an IT program was added in 2013 where students enrolled in biblical studies can also learn how to manage media to further promote the gospel.<ref name=Academics />\n\n===Presidents of Eston College===\nThere have been five presidents of Eston College <ref name=History/>\n*Dr. G.
