Fort Saskatchewan is bordered by [[Strathcona County]] to the south and east, [[Sturgeon County]] to the north and west, and the City of Edmonton to the southwest.  Sturgeon County is across the North Saskatchewan River.\n\nThe city is most well known for its proximity to petrochemical facilities, including [[Dow Chemical]], [[Sherritt International]], [[Agrium]] and [[Shell Canada]]. It is also known for its flock of 50 sheep that roam the Fort Heritage Precinct throughout the summer months eating the grass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fortsaskonline.com/local/sheep-say-goodbye-to-fort-saskatchewan|title=Sheep say goodbye to Fort Saskatchewan|last=Janzen|first=Cody|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref> The city mascot is a sheep named Auggie.<ref name=mascot>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |title=Our Mascot |author=City of Fort Saskatchewan |accessdate=2009-03-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103224350/http://www.fortsask.ca/ftsk_Visitors/ftsk_Our_Mascot.aspx |archivedate=January 3, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Pre-colonization and founding ===\nPrior to [[History of Canada|colonization]], the area around what is now Fort Saskatchewan was a gathering place and home to a variety of different [[Indigenous peoples in Canada|Indigenous]] nations, including the [[Cree|Cree (N\u00e9hinaw)]] and [[Nakoda (Stoney)|Nakota]] nations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskatchewanrecord.com/news/local-news/here-is-a-sneak-peek|title=Here is a sneak peek|last=January 31|first=Arthur Green Published on:|last2=January 31|first2=2019 {{!}} Last Updated:|date=2019-01-31|website=Fort Saskatchewan Record|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-01|last3=Est|first3=2019 4:20 Pm}}</ref> The Indigenous peoples of the region commonly traveled the North Saskatchewan River by [[Canoe]].

An addition was built on the west side of the station in 1911; a sign of the growth in population and rail traffic that Fort Saskatchewan experienced.

By 1973, the jail employed 220 residents<ref name=\"peterream3\" /> and housed both male and female offenders.  \n\nThe jail was replaced in 1988 when a new provincial correctional centre was built south of Highway 15 on 101st Street. The jail cell blocks were demolished in 1994. The Warden's House is the only remaining structure linked to the old gaol; the last building on the actual prison grounds, the facility workshop, was demolished in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fortsaskonline.com/local/re-visit-fort-sask-jail-history|title=Re-visit Fort Sask Jail History|website=FortSaskOnline.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>.  The Warden's House was symbolically constructed on city grounds near the prison, rather than on the prison grounds themselves.

They are also sometimes called the '''Black Monks''', in reference to the colour of the members' [[religious habit]]s.\n\nDespite being called an order, the Benedictines do not operate under a single hierarchy but are instead organised as a collection of independent [[Cenobium|monastic communities]], with each community ([[monastery]], [[priory]] or [[abbey]]) within the order maintaining its autonomy. Unlike other religious orders, the Benedictines do not have a [[superior general]] or [[motherhouse]] with universal jurisdiction. Instead, the order is represented internationally by the [[Benedictine Confederation]], an organization that was set up in 1893 to represent the order's shared interests.\n\n==Historical development==\n{{Main|Benedict of Nursia}}\n[[File:Fra Angelico 031.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Benedict of Nursia (c.&nbsp;480\u2013543). Detail from a [[fresco]] by [[Fra Angelico]] (c.&nbsp;1400\u20131455) in the [[San Marco, Florence|Friary of San Marco]] [[Florence]].]]\n\nThe monastery at [[Subiaco, Lazio|Subiaco]] in Italy, established by [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict of Nursia]] {{circa}} 529, was the first of the dozen monasteries he founded. He later founded the [[Abbey of Monte Cassino]]. There is no evidence, however, that he intended to found an order and the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] presupposes the autonomy of each community. When Monte Cassino was sacked by the Lombards about the year 580, the monks fled to Rome, and it seems probable that this constituted an important factor in the diffusion of a knowledge of Benedictine monasticism.<ref name=\"Catholic\">{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Benedictine Order|last=Alston|first=Cyprian|volume=2}}</ref>\n\nIt was from the monastery of St. Andrew in Rome that [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], the prior, and his forty companions set forth in 595 on their mission for the evangelization of England. At various stopping places during the journey, the monks left behind them traditions concerning their rule and form of life, and probably also some copies of the Rule. [[L\u00e9rins Abbey]], for instance, founded by [[Honoratus]] in 375, probably received its first knowledge of the Benedictine Rule from the visit of St. Augustine and his companions in 596.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n[[Gregory of Tours]] says that at [[Basilica of Saint-Martin d'Ainay#Ainay Abbey|Ainay Abbey]], in the sixth century, the monks \"followed the rules of Basil, Cassian, Caesarius, and other fathers, taking and using whatever seemed proper to the conditions of time and place\", and doubtless the same liberty was taken with the Benedictine Rule when it reached them. In Gaul and Switzerland, it supplemented the much stricter Irish or Celtic Rule introduced by [[Columbanus]] and others. In many monasteries it eventually entirely displaced the earlier codes.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n[[File:Benedikt von Aniane.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Benedict of Aniane]] (747\u2013821).]]\nBy the ninth century, however, the Benedictine had become the standard form of monastic life throughout the whole of Western Europe, excepting Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, where the Celtic observance still prevailed for another century or two.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/> Largely through the work of [[Benedict of Aniane]], it became the rule of choice for monasteries throughout the Carolingian empire.<ref name=Theisen>{{cite web|url=http://www.osb.org/gen/benedictines.html|title=The Benedictines: An Introduction by Abbot Primate Jerome Theisen OSB. Liturgical Press.|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMonastic scriptoria flourished from the ninth through the twelfth centuries. Sacred Scripture was always at the heart of every monastic scriptorium. As a general rule those of the monks who possessed skill as writers made this their chief, if not their sole active work. An anonymous writer of the ninth or tenth century speaks of six hours a day as the usual task of a scribe, which would absorb almost all the time available for active work in the day of a medieval monk.<ref name=\"CE1913_Scriptorium\">{{cite CE1913|last= Huddleston|first= Gilbert Roger|wstitle=Scriptorium|volume= 13}}</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Ages monasteries were often founded by the nobility. [[Cluny Abbey]] was founded by [[William I, Duke of Aquitaine]] in 910. The abbey was noted for its strict adherence to the Rule of St. Benedict. The abbot of Cluny was the superior of all the daughter houses, through appointed priors.<ref name=Theisen/>\n\nOne of the earliest reforms of Benedictine practice was that initiated in 980 by [[Romuald]], who founded the [[Camaldolese]] community.\n\nThe dominance of the Benedictine monastic way of life began to decline towards the end of the twelfth century, which saw the rise of the Franciscans and Dominicans.<ref name=Theisen/> Benedictines took a fourth vow of \"stability\", which professed loyalty to a particular foundation. Not being bound by location, the mendicants were better able to respond to an increasingly \"urban\" environment. This decline was further exacerbated by the practice of appointing a commendatory abbot, a lay person, appointed by a noble to oversee and to protect the goods of the monastery. Oftentimes, however, this resulted in the appropriation of the assets of monasteries at the expense of the community which they were intended to support.\n\n===England===\nThe English Benedictine Congregation is the oldest of the nineteen Benedictine congregations. Augustine of Canterbury and his monks established the first English Benedictine monastery at Canterbury soon after their arrival in 597. Other foundations quickly followed. Through the influence of [[Wilfrid]], [[Benedict Biscop]], and [[Dunstan]], the Benedictine Rule spread with extraordinary rapidity, and in the North it was adopted in most of the monasteries that had been founded by the Celtic missionaries from Iona. Many of the episcopal sees of England were founded and governed by the Benedictines, and no fewer than nine of the old cathedrals were served by the black monks of the priories attached to them.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/> Monasteries served as hospitals and places of refuge for the weak and homeless. The monks studied the healing properties of plants and minerals to alleviate the sufferings of the sick.<ref name=Hicks>{{cite web|url=http://www.osb.org/gen/hicks/index.html|author=Dom Bruno Hicks OSB|title=  The Benedictines|date=2009|access-date=15 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105194639/http://www.osb.org/gen/hicks/index.html|archive-date=5 November 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nGermany was evangelized by English Benedictines. [[Willibrord]] and [[Boniface]] preached there in the seventh and eighth centuries and founded several abbeys.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n \nIn the [[English Reformation]], all [[Dissolution of the monasteries|monasteries were dissolved]] and their lands confiscated by the Crown, forcing their [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] members to flee into exile on the Continent. During the 19th century they were able to return to England, including to [[Selby Abbey]] in [[Yorkshire]], one of the few great monastic churches to survive the Dissolution.\n[[File:Saint Benedict Medal.jpg|thumb|The two sides of a ''Saint Benedict Medal'']]\n\n[[Minster-in-Thanet|St. Mildred's Priory]], on the [[Isle of Thanet]], [[Kent]], was built in 1027 on the site of an abbey founded in 670 by the daughter of the first Christian [[King of Kent]].

The older translation \"conversion of life\" has generally been replaced with phrases such as \"[conversion to] a monastic manner of life\", drawing from the Vulgate's use of ''conversatio'' as a translation of \"citizenship\" or \"homeland\" in Philippians 3:20.  Some scholars have claimed that the vow formula of the Rule is best translated as \"to live in this place as a monk, in obedience to its rule and abbot.\"\n\nBenedictine [[abbot]]s and [[abbess]]es have full jurisdiction of their [[abbey]] and thus absolute authority over the [[Roman Catholic monk|monk]]s or [[nun]]s who are resident.  This authority includes the power to assign duties, to decide which books may or may not be read, to regulate comings and goings, and to punish and to [[excommunicate]], in the sense of an enforced isolation from the monastic community.\n\nA tight communal timetable{{spaced ndash}}the [[horarium]]{{spaced ndash}}is meant to ensure that the time given by God is not wasted but used in God's service, whether for prayer, work, meals, spiritual reading or sleep.\n\nAlthough Benedictines do not take a vow of silence, hours of strict silence are set, and at other times silence is maintained as much as is practically possible. Social conversations tend to be limited to communal recreation times. But such details, like the many other details of the daily routine of a Benedictine house that the Rule of St Benedict leaves to the discretion of the superior, are set out in its 'customary'. A ' customary' is the code adopted by a particular Benedictine house, adapting the Rule to local conditions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mountmichael.org/Media/MountMichaelAbbey/Abbey/CUSTOMARY.pdf |title=Customary: Mount Michael Abbey|date=1 September 2013 |access-date=15 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323023219/http://mountmichael.org/Media/MountMichaelAbbey/Abbey/CUSTOMARY.pdf |archive-date=23 March 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, according to the norms of the 1983 [[Code of Canon Law]], a Benedictine abbey is a \"[[religious institute]]\" and its members are therefore members of the [[consecrated life]]<!--?: , commonly referred to as \"Religious\"-->. While Canon Law 588 \u00a71 explains that Benedictine monks are \"neither clerical nor lay\", they can, however, be ordained.\n\nSome monasteries adopt a more active ministry in living the monastic life, running schools or parishes; others are more focused on contemplation, with more of an emphasis on prayer and work within the confines of the cloister.\n\n==Organization==\nBenedictine monasticism is fundamentally different from other Western religious orders insofar as its individual communities are not part of a religious order with \"Generalates\" and \"Superiors General\". Each Benedictine house is independent and governed by an Abbot.\n\nIn modern times, the various groups of autonomous houses (national, reform, etc.) have formed themselves loosely into congregations (for example, Cassinese, English, Solesmes, Subiaco, Camaldolese, Sylvestrines). These, in turn, are represented in the [[Benedictine Confederation]] that came into existence through [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s Apostolic Brief \"Summum semper\" on 12 July 1893.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Benedictine Confederation |url=http://www.osb.org/the-benedictine-order/the-benedictine-confederation/ |website=OSB.org |accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref> This organization facilitates dialogue of Benedictine communities with each other and the relationship between Benedictine communities and other [[religious order]]s and the church at large. The Abbot Primate resides at the Monastery of Sant\u2019 Anselmo in Rome.<ref>[http://www.benedictinemonks.co.uk/news/st-benedict-the-order/ The Benedictine Monks, UK]</ref>\n\nIn 1313 [[Bernardo Tolomei]] established the [[Olivetans|Order of Our Lady of Mount Olivet]]. The community adopted the Rule of St. Benedict and received canonical approval in 1344. The Olivetans are part of the Benedictine Confederation.\n\n==Other orders==\nThe Rule of Saint Benedict is also used by a number of religious orders that began as reforms of the Benedictine tradition such as the [[Cistercian]]s and [[Trappist]]s. These groups are separate congregations and not members of the [[Benedictine Confederation]].\n\nAlthough Benedictines are traditionally Catholic, there are also some communities that claim adherence to the Rule of Saint Benedict within the [[Anglican Communion]], [[Eastern Orthodox Church]],<ref name=\"Simpson2016\">{{Cite web |title=Directory of Parishes |last=Simpson |first=Fr.

They are also sometimes called the '''Black Monks''', in reference to the colour of the members' [[religious habit]]s.\n\nDespite being called an order, the Benedictines do not operate under a single hierarchy but are instead organised as a collection of independent [[Cenobium|monastic communities]], with each community ([[monastery]], [[priory]] or [[abbey]]) within the order maintaining its autonomy. Unlike other religious orders, the Benedictines do not have a [[superior general]] or [[motherhouse]] with universal jurisdiction. Instead, the order is represented internationally by the [[Benedictine Confederation]], an organization that was set up in 1893 to represent the order's shared interests.\n\n==Historical development==\n{{Main|Benedict of Nursia}}\n[[File:Fra Angelico 031.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Benedict of Nursia (c.&nbsp;480\u2013543).

He later founded the [[Abbey of Monte Cassino]]. There is no evidence, however, that he intended to found an order and the [[Rule of Saint Benedict]] presupposes the autonomy of each community. When Monte Cassino was sacked by the Lombards about the year 580, the monks fled to Rome, and it seems probable that this constituted an important factor in the diffusion of a knowledge of Benedictine monasticism.<ref name=\"Catholic\">{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Benedictine Order|last=Alston|first=Cyprian|volume=2}}</ref>\n\nIt was from the monastery of St. Andrew in Rome that [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], the prior, and his forty companions set forth in 595 on their mission for the evangelization of England. At various stopping places during the journey, the monks left behind them traditions concerning their rule and form of life, and probably also some copies of the Rule. [[L\u00e9rins Abbey]], for instance, founded by [[Honoratus]] in 375, probably received its first knowledge of the Benedictine Rule from the visit of St. Augustine and his companions in 596.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n[[Gregory of Tours]] says that at [[Basilica of Saint-Martin d'Ainay#Ainay Abbey|Ainay Abbey]], in the sixth century, the monks \"followed the rules of Basil, Cassian, Caesarius, and other fathers, taking and using whatever seemed proper to the conditions of time and place\", and doubtless the same liberty was taken with the Benedictine Rule when it reached them. In Gaul and Switzerland, it supplemented the much stricter Irish or Celtic Rule introduced by [[Columbanus]] and others. In many monasteries it eventually entirely displaced the earlier codes.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/>\n\n[[File:Benedikt von Aniane.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Benedict of Aniane]] (747\u2013821).]]\nBy the ninth century, however, the Benedictine had become the standard form of monastic life throughout the whole of Western Europe, excepting Scotland, Wales, and Ireland, where the Celtic observance still prevailed for another century or two.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/> Largely through the work of [[Benedict of Aniane]], it became the rule of choice for monasteries throughout the Carolingian empire.<ref name=Theisen>{{cite web|url=http://www.osb.org/gen/benedictines.html|title=The Benedictines: An Introduction by Abbot Primate Jerome Theisen OSB.

As a general rule those of the monks who possessed skill as writers made this their chief, if not their sole active work. An anonymous writer of the ninth or tenth century speaks of six hours a day as the usual task of a scribe, which would absorb almost all the time available for active work in the day of a medieval monk.<ref name=\"CE1913_Scriptorium\">{{cite CE1913|last= Huddleston|first= Gilbert Roger|wstitle=Scriptorium|volume= 13}}</ref>\n\nIn the Middle Ages monasteries were often founded by the nobility. [[Cluny Abbey]] was founded by [[William I, Duke of Aquitaine]] in 910. The abbey was noted for its strict adherence to the Rule of St. Benedict. The abbot of Cluny was the superior of all the daughter houses, through appointed priors.<ref name=Theisen/>\n\nOne of the earliest reforms of Benedictine practice was that initiated in 980 by [[Romuald]], who founded the [[Camaldolese]] community.\n\nThe dominance of the Benedictine monastic way of life began to decline towards the end of the twelfth century, which saw the rise of the Franciscans and Dominicans.<ref name=Theisen/> Benedictines took a fourth vow of \"stability\", which professed loyalty to a particular foundation. Not being bound by location, the mendicants were better able to respond to an increasingly \"urban\" environment. This decline was further exacerbated by the practice of appointing a commendatory abbot, a lay person, appointed by a noble to oversee and to protect the goods of the monastery. Oftentimes, however, this resulted in the appropriation of the assets of monasteries at the expense of the community which they were intended to support.\n\n===England===\nThe English Benedictine Congregation is the oldest of the nineteen Benedictine congregations. Augustine of Canterbury and his monks established the first English Benedictine monastery at Canterbury soon after their arrival in 597. Other foundations quickly followed. Through the influence of [[Wilfrid]], [[Benedict Biscop]], and [[Dunstan]], the Benedictine Rule spread with extraordinary rapidity, and in the North it was adopted in most of the monasteries that had been founded by the Celtic missionaries from Iona. Many of the episcopal sees of England were founded and governed by the Benedictines, and no fewer than nine of the old cathedrals were served by the black monks of the priories attached to them.<ref name=\"Catholic\"/> Monasteries served as hospitals and places of refuge for the weak and homeless.

The older translation \"conversion of life\" has generally been replaced with phrases such as \"[conversion to] a monastic manner of life\", drawing from the Vulgate's use of ''conversatio'' as a translation of \"citizenship\" or \"homeland\" in Philippians 3:20.  Some scholars have claimed that the vow formula of the Rule is best translated as \"to live in this place as a monk, in obedience to its rule and abbot.\"\n\nBenedictine [[abbot]]s and [[abbess]]es have full jurisdiction of their [[abbey]] and thus absolute authority over the [[Roman Catholic monk|monk]]s or [[nun]]s who are resident.  This authority includes the power to assign duties, to decide which books may or may not be read, to regulate comings and goings, and to punish and to [[excommunicate]], in the sense of an enforced isolation from the monastic community.\n\nA tight communal timetable{{spaced ndash}}the [[horarium]]{{spaced ndash}}is meant to ensure that the time given by God is not wasted but used in God's service, whether for prayer, work, meals, spiritual reading or sleep.\n\nAlthough Benedictines do not take a vow of silence, hours of strict silence are set, and at other times silence is maintained as much as is practically possible. Social conversations tend to be limited to communal recreation times. But such details, like the many other details of the daily routine of a Benedictine house that the Rule of St Benedict leaves to the discretion of the superior, are set out in its 'customary'. A ' customary' is the code adopted by a particular Benedictine house, adapting the Rule to local conditions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mountmichael.org/Media/MountMichaelAbbey/Abbey/CUSTOMARY.pdf |title=Customary: Mount Michael Abbey|date=1 September 2013 |access-date=15 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323023219/http://mountmichael.org/Media/MountMichaelAbbey/Abbey/CUSTOMARY.pdf |archive-date=23 March 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn the Roman Catholic Church, according to the norms of the 1983 [[Code of Canon Law]], a Benedictine abbey is a \"[[religious institute]]\" and its members are therefore members of the [[consecrated life]]<!--?: , commonly referred to as \"Religious\"-->. While Canon Law 588 \u00a71 explains that Benedictine monks are \"neither clerical nor lay\", they can, however, be ordained.\n\nSome monasteries adopt a more active ministry in living the monastic life, running schools or parishes; others are more focused on contemplation, with more of an emphasis on prayer and work within the confines of the cloister.\n\n==Organization==\nBenedictine monasticism is fundamentally different from other Western religious orders insofar as its individual communities are not part of a religious order with \"Generalates\" and \"Superiors General\". Each Benedictine house is independent and governed by an Abbot.\n\nIn modern times, the various groups of autonomous houses (national, reform, etc.) have formed themselves loosely into congregations (for example, Cassinese, English, Solesmes, Subiaco, Camaldolese, Sylvestrines). These, in turn, are represented in the [[Benedictine Confederation]] that came into existence through [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s Apostolic Brief \"Summum semper\" on 12 July 1893.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Benedictine Confederation |url=http://www.osb.org/the-benedictine-order/the-benedictine-confederation/ |website=OSB.org |accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref> This organization facilitates dialogue of Benedictine communities with each other and the relationship between Benedictine communities and other [[religious order]]s and the church at large.

But the advent of Tinder that year meant that first impressions could play a crucial role. For social scientists studying [[Human mating strategies|human courtship behavior]], Tinder offers a much simpler environment than its predecessors. In 2016, Gareth Tyson of the [[Queen Mary University of London]] and his colleagues published a paper analyzing the behavior of Tinder users in [[New York City]] and [[London]]. In order to minimize the number of variables, they created profiles of white heterosexual people only. For each sex, there were three accounts using stock photographs, two with actual photographs of volunteers, one with no photos whatsoever, and one that was apparently deactivated. The researchers pointedly only used pictures of people of average physical attractiveness. Tyson and his team wrote an algorithm that collected the biographical information of all the matches, liked them all, then counted the number of returning likes.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601909/how-tinder-feedback-loop-forces-men-and-women-into-extreme-strategies/|title=How Tinder \"Feedback Loop\" Forces Men and Women into Extreme Strategies|date=July 15, 2016|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=December 8, 2019|department=Tech Policy}}</ref>\n\nThey found that men and women employed drastically different mating strategies. Men liked a large proportion of the profiles they viewed, but received returning likes only 0.6% of the time; women were much more selective but received matches 10% of the time. Men received matches at a much slower rate than women. Once they received a match, women were far more likely than men to send a message, 21% compared to 7%, but they took more time before doing so. Tyson and his team found that for the first two-thirds of messages from each sex, women sent them within 18 minutes of receiving a match compared to five minutes for men. Men's first messages had an average of a dozen characters, and were typical simple greetings; by contrast, initial messages by women averaged 122 characters.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTyson and his collaborators found that the male profiles that had three profile pictures received 238 matches while the male profiles with only one profile picture received only 44 matches (or approximately a 5 to 1 ratio). Additionally, male profiles that had a biography received 69 matches while those without it received only 16 matches (or approximately a 4 to 1 ratio). By sending out questionnaires to frequent Tinder users, the researchers discovered that the reason why men tended to like a large proportion of the women they saw was to increase their chances of getting a match. This led to a feedback loop in which men liked more and more of the profiles they saw while women could afford to be even more selective in liking profiles because of a greater probability of a match. The mathematical limit of the feedback loop occurs when men like all profiles they see while women find a match whenever they like a profile. It was not known whether some [[evolutionarily stable strategy]] has emerged, nor has Tinder revealed such information.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTyson and his team found that even though the men-to-women ratio of their data set was approximately one, the male profiles received 8,248 matches in total while the female profiles received only 532 matches in total because the vast majority of the matches for both the male and female profiles came from male profiles (with 86 percent of the matches for the male profiles alone coming from other male profiles), leading the researchers to conclude that homosexual men were \"far more active in liking than heterosexual women.\" On the other hand, the deactivated male account received all of its matches from women. The researchers were not sure why this happened.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Safety issues ==\nThere are also [[Computer security|cybersecurity]], [[Information privacy|data privacy]], and [[public health]] concerns about Tinder.

But the advent of Tinder that year meant that first impressions could play a crucial role. For social scientists studying [[Human mating strategies|human courtship behavior]], Tinder offers a much simpler environment than its predecessors. In 2016, Gareth Tyson of the [[Queen Mary University of London]] and his colleagues published a paper analyzing the behavior of Tinder users in [[New York City]] and [[London]]. In order to minimize the number of variables, they created profiles of white heterosexual people only. For each sex, there were three accounts using stock photographs, two with actual photographs of volunteers, one with no photos whatsoever, and one that was apparently deactivated. The researchers pointedly only used pictures of people of average physical attractiveness. Tyson and his team wrote an algorithm that collected the biographical information of all the matches, liked them all, then counted the number of returning likes.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601909/how-tinder-feedback-loop-forces-men-and-women-into-extreme-strategies/|title=How Tinder \"Feedback Loop\" Forces Men and Women into Extreme Strategies|date=July 15, 2016|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=December 8, 2019|department=Tech Policy}}</ref>\n\nThey found that men and women employed drastically different mating strategies. Men liked a large proportion of the profiles they viewed, but received returning likes only 0.6% of the time; women were much more selective but received matches 10% of the time. Men received matches at a much slower rate than women. Once they received a match, women were far more likely than men to send a message, 21% compared to 7%, but they took more time before doing so. Tyson and his team found that for the first two-thirds of messages from each sex, women sent them within 18 minutes of receiving a match compared to five minutes for men. Men's first messages had an average of a dozen characters, and were typical simple greetings; by contrast, initial messages by women averaged 122 characters.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTyson and his collaborators found that the male profiles that had three profile pictures received 238 matches while the male profiles with only one profile picture received only 44 matches (or approximately a 5 to 1 ratio). Additionally, male profiles that had a biography received 69 matches while those without it received only 16 matches (or approximately a 4 to 1 ratio). By sending out questionnaires to frequent Tinder users, the researchers discovered that the reason why men tended to like a large proportion of the women they saw was to increase their chances of getting a match. This led to a feedback loop in which men liked more and more of the profiles they saw while women could afford to be even more selective in liking profiles because of a greater probability of a match. The mathematical limit of the feedback loop occurs when men like all profiles they see while women find a match whenever they like a profile.
