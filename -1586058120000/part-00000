The game is inspired by [[Infinity Engine]] role-playing games, and was designed and written by [[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 15 October 2019, with [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] releases planned for 2020. ''Disco Elysium'' received universal acclaim from critics, with its narrative and conversation systems receiving the most praise. It was also nominated for and won several awards, including [[game of the year]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Disco Elysium interface.jpg|thumb|left|A screenshot of the interface]]\n''Disco Elysium'' is a [[role-playing video game]] that features an [[open world]] and dialogue-heavy gameplay mechanics.<ref name=PCGUS/><ref name=techspot>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Coberly |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82354-ambitious-open-world-rpg-disco-elysium-you-take.html|title=Ambitious open-world RPG Disco Elysium lets you take on the role of a mentally unstable detective|publisher=Techspot}}</ref> The game is presented in an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] in which the [[player character]] is controlled.<ref name=USgamer/> The player takes the role of a detective on a murder case who suffers from alcohol and drug-induced amnesia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brad |title=Disco Elysium Review \u2013 Stayin' Alive |url=https://www.criticalhit.net/review/disco-elysium-review-stayin-alive/ |website=criticalhit.net |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay features no combat in the traditional sense; instead, it is handled through dialogue trees and skill checks.<ref name=gamecrate>{{cite web |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/disco-elysium-character-generation-skill-checks-and-gameplay-strategy/24424|title=DISCO ELYSIUM: CHARACTER GENERATION, SKILL CHECKS AND GAMEPLAY STRATEGY|website=Gamecrate.com}}</ref> There are four primary abilities in the game: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics, and each ability has six distinct secondary skills for a total of 24.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills>{{cite web |date=14 October 2019 |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/14/disco-elysium-skills-character-creation-intellect-psyche-physique-motorics-and-the-24-skills-explained/|title=Disco Elysium skills & character creation: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics, and the 24 skills explained|website=rockpapershotgun.com}}</ref> The player improves these skills through skill points earned from leveling up, and is able to raise a skill temporarily by equipping a piece of clothing.<ref name=gamecrate/> Upgrading these skills help the player character pass skill checks, but could also potentially result in negative effects and character quirks. For instance, a player character with high Drama may be able to detect and fabricate lies effectively, but may also become prone to hysterics and paranoia. Likewise, high Electrochemistry shields the player character from the negative effects of drugs and provides knowledge on them, but may also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills/>\n\n''Disco Elysium'' features a secondary inventory system, the Thought Cabinet.  Thoughts are unlockable through conversations with other characters, as well as through internal dialogues within the mind of the player character himself. The player is then able to \"internalize\" a thought through a certain amount of in-game hours, which, once completed, grants the player character permanent benefits but also occasionally negative effects.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 October 2019 |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/15/disco-elysium-thought-cabinet-the-thoughts-system-explained/#what-is-the-thought-cabinet|title=Disco Elysium Thought Cabinet: the Thoughts system explained|website=rockpapershotgun.com}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\nThe world of ''Disco Elysium'' is made of landmasses known as Isolas that are separated by the Pale, a mysterious connective tissue in which the laws of reality begin to break down. Prolonged exposure to the Pale can cause mental instability and madness. Humanity crosses it via specially built airships. Civilization in Disco Elysium is comparable to late 20th century Earth, both technologically and culturally. Nations and people within Disco Elysium follow different ideologies, including [[communism]], Traditionalism (a mix of [[fascism]] and [[monarchism]]), Ultraliberalism (a form of [[libertarianism]]) and Moralism (a form of centrist [[capitalist]] democracy).\n\n''Disco Elysium'' takes place in the fictional city of Revachol in the island chain of Insulinde, specifically in Martinaise, a district plagued by poverty, crime, and corruption.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> Five decades prior to the start of the game, a communist revolution took place in Revachol and successfully overthrew the old monarchy that controlled the city, forming a [[Commune (model of government)|commune]] afterwards, but it was soon toppled by an invasion of an alliance of capitalist nations calling themselves \"the Coalition\". Revachol has since been designated a Special Administrative Region under the Coalition, who holds a strong grip over the city's local economy and keeps its autonomy at a minimum. One of the few governmental functions that Revachol is allowed to handle itself is upholding day to day law and order, which is the task of the Revachol Citizens Militia (RCM). While starting out as a voluntary citizens brigade, the RCM has since grown and evolved into a semi-professional police force.\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe player character, a detective of the RCM, wakes up in a trashed cafeteria motel room with a severe hangover and no memory of his own identity. He is greeted by his assigned partner Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, who informs him that they are investigating the death of a hanged man in the cafeteria's backyard. The man's identity is unclear and initial investigation indicates that he was [[lynched]] by a group of people. Detailed analysis however implies that he was killed before being hanged. The Hardie Boys, a group of dockworkers who act as [[vigilante]]s in Martinaise, claim collective responsibility for the murder. They assert that the man attempted to rape a cafeteria guest by the name of Klaasje; Klaasje however denies the claim of rape.\n\nIt becomes apparent that the killing is connected to a strike by Martinaise's dockworkers union against the Wild Pines corporation. The detectives meet up with the union boss Evrart Claire, who denies association with the killing. They also meet with the Wild Pines representative Joyce Messier. She reveals that the hanged man's name was 'Lely' and that he was a member of a mercenary squad assigned to protect Joyce during negotiations with the union. However, the death of Lely has driven them to go rogue. Joyce warns that unless the detectives find the true culprit soon, the mercenaries will likely enact bloody retribution across Martinaise.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the district, following up on leads to the case, investigating small cases and helping residents with tasks such as helping a group of dancers turn a church into a nightclub and helping a group of [[cryptid]] hunters look for the 'Insulindian Phasmid', a giant [[stick insect]]. Throughout the game, the player begins to fill in gaps in the detective's identity, revealing him to be Harrier \"Harry\" DuBois. A decorated RCM detective, Harry experienced an event several years ago that began a [[mid-life crisis]], eventually culminating in a self-destructive bender around Martinaise in which he dismissed the rest of his squad.\n\nKlassje reveals that Lely was shot in the mouth whist the two were having sex. Unable to figure out the origin of the bullet and fearful of involving the authorities, Klaasje enlisted the help of a dockworker named Ruby, who with the rest of the Hardie Boys staged Lely's death as a hanging. Ruby then went into hiding across the bay. The player has the options of issuing a notice for Klaasje's summons (which leads to her subsequent flight) or taking her into custody. The detectives then follow the trail across the shore and eventually find Ruby within an abandoned building, where she incapacitates them with a Pale device. She claims that the cover up was all Klaasje's idea and furthermore has no idea who shot Lely. The player manages to resist or disable the Pale device and tries to arrest her. Ruby states that she would rather kill herself, which she does if she is unable to escape.\n\nThe detectives return to find themselves in a stand off between the mercenaries and the Hardie Boys. A firefight breaks out and the player is badly wounded by the mercenary leader, blacking out and waking up a few days later. Most or all the mercenaries are killed and Kim may be hospitalized due to his wounds, in which case street urchin Cuno offers to take his place. The detectives begin chasing down their last leads, ultimately determining that the shot that killed Lely came from an old sea fort just off the shore of Martinaise.\n\nWhile at the fort, Harry has a dream in which he meets a manifestation of his ex-fianc\u00e9e Dora Ingerlund, who left Harry out of both dissatisfaction at his low income and his apparent mental instability. She then reveals that this is what drove Harry onto his emotional breakdown; he is plagued by this same dream recurring every couple of days, the moment of her leaving him and him trying and failing to win her back and unable to move on from her.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the fort and find the shooter: a former Commissar from the old Revachol communist army named Iosef Lilianovich Dros. Iosef's motivations are revealed to be ultimately born out of his bitterness towards the new capitalist system Lely represented, as well as his own sexual envy for Klaasje. With all of the evidence now found, the detectives arrest him for the murder. At this point, the Insulindian Phasmid appears from the reeds. The player may be able to have a psychic conversation with the Phasmid, who tells Harry that it finds the notion of his unstable mind to be fearful, but is in awe at his ability to continue existing day after day. It comforts Harry, telling him to move on from the wreck of his life and move forward. After the detectives take its picture, the Phasmid moves on.\n\nAfter returning to Martinaise, Harry and his partner are confronted by his old squad. They discuss Harry's actions during the game, reflecting on whether he has solved the case and how he handled the mercenaries, as well as being impressed by the news that the Phasmid does exist. Harry's former partner Jean Vicquemare confirms that Harry's emotional breakdown was indeed the result of Dora leaving him several years ago. If the player has done well, the squad expresses hope that Harry's state will improve in the future, and invites him and either Kim or Cuno to a special RCM unit.\n\n==Development and release==\n''Disco Elysium'' was developed by ZA/UM, a company founded in 2016 by [[Karelians|Karelian]]-[[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], who served as the game's lead writer and designer.<ref name= Gamesindustry>{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Haydn |date=31 October 2018 |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-31-disco-elysium|title=Chasing oblivion with Disco Elysium and alcohol addiction|website=Gamesindustry.biz}}</ref><ref name= Kurvitz>{{cite web |last1=Macgregor |first1=Jody |title=Disco Elysium's lead designer wants to make an expansion and sequel, has already written a novel |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/disco-elysiums-lead-designer-wants-to-make-an-expansion-and-sequel-has-already-written-a-novel/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref> Kurvitz had previously created the game's setting for a [[tabletop RPG]], and has also written novels, such as ''Sacred and Terrible Air'' (2013), that take place in it.<ref name= Kurvitz/> A team consisting of eight writers also assisted Kurvitz.<ref name=gamesindustry.biz>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-07-20-making-games-under-threat-of-nuclear-war|title=Making games under threat of nuclear war|website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Edward |title=Disco Elysium \u2013 Rezzed 2018 Interview |url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/disco-elysium-rezzed-2018-interview.html |website=gameanalytics.com |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref> The game's original title was ''No Truce With The Furies'', but was renamed in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/03/09/no-truce-with-the-furies-gets-a-mad-new-title-and-trailer/|title=No Truce With The Furies gets a mad new title and trailer|first=Dominic|last=Tarason|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=March 9, 2018}}</ref> During development, some of the staff relocated from Estonia to London, with other designers working out of [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and [[China]].<ref name=gamesindustry.biz/><ref name=Postimees>{{cite news |last1=Altk\u00fcla |first1=Magnus |title=Kaur Kender on new computer game: It\u2019s like 'Truth and Justice' |url=https://news.postimees.ee/6807443/kaur-kender-on-new-computer-game-it-s-like-truth-and-justice |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=22 October 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> Majority of the game's funding was provided by Estonian businessman {{ill|Margus Linnam\u00e4e|et|Margus Linnam\u00e4e}}.<ref name=Postimees/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://raha.geenius.ee/rubriik/uudis/kaur-kenderi-uus-videomanguari-on-neelanud-juba-700-000-eurot-investorite-raha/|title=Kaur Kenderi uus videom\u00e4ngu\u00e4ri on neelanud juba 700 000 eurot investorite raha|first=Deisi|last=Helem\u00e4e|publisher=Geenius.ee|date=5 September 2018|lang=Estonian|accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> ZA/UM cited a variety of different influences and inspirations for the game, including other games ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'' and ''[[Kentucky Route Zero]]''; television shows ''[[The Wire]]'', ''[[True Detective]]'' and ''[[The Shield]]''; the literary works of [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[China Mi\u00e9ville]], the [[Strugatsky brothers]], and [[\u00c9mile Zola]]; and artists [[Rembrandt]], [[Ilya Repin]], [[Jenny Saville]], [[Alex Kanevsky]], and [[Wassily Kandinsky]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/632470/announcements/detail/3334287173823797601|title=Steam :: Disco Elysium :: Disco Elysium -

The game is inspired by [[Infinity Engine]] role-playing games, and was designed and written by [[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]]. It was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on 15 October 2019, with [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] releases planned for 2020. ''Disco Elysium'' received universal acclaim from critics, with its narrative and conversation systems receiving the most praise. It was also nominated for and won several awards, including [[game of the year]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Disco Elysium interface.jpg|thumb|left|A screenshot of the interface]]\n''Disco Elysium'' is a [[role-playing video game]] that features an [[open world]] and dialogue-heavy gameplay mechanics.<ref name=PCGUS/><ref name=techspot>{{cite web |last=Cohen |first=Coberly |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.techspot.com/news/82354-ambitious-open-world-rpg-disco-elysium-you-take.html|title=Ambitious open-world RPG Disco Elysium lets you take on the role of a mentally unstable detective|publisher=Techspot}}</ref> The game is presented in an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric perspective]] in which the [[player character]] is controlled.<ref name=USgamer/> The player takes the role of a detective on a murder case who suffers from alcohol and drug-induced amnesia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lang |first1=Brad |title=Disco Elysium Review \u2013 Stayin' Alive |url=https://www.criticalhit.net/review/disco-elysium-review-stayin-alive/ |website=criticalhit.net |accessdate=18 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe gameplay features no combat in the traditional sense; instead, it is handled through dialogue trees and skill checks.<ref name=gamecrate>{{cite web |date=16 October 2019 |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/disco-elysium-character-generation-skill-checks-and-gameplay-strategy/24424|title=DISCO ELYSIUM: CHARACTER GENERATION, SKILL CHECKS AND GAMEPLAY STRATEGY|website=Gamecrate.com}}</ref> There are four primary abilities in the game: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, and Motorics, and each ability has six distinct secondary skills for a total of 24.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills>{{cite web |date=14 October 2019 |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/14/disco-elysium-skills-character-creation-intellect-psyche-physique-motorics-and-the-24-skills-explained/|title=Disco Elysium skills & character creation: Intellect, Psyche, Physique, Motorics, and the 24 skills explained|website=rockpapershotgun.com}}</ref> The player improves these skills through skill points earned from leveling up, and is able to raise a skill temporarily by equipping a piece of clothing.<ref name=gamecrate/> Upgrading these skills help the player character pass skill checks, but could also potentially result in negative effects and character quirks. For instance, a player character with high Drama may be able to detect and fabricate lies effectively, but may also become prone to hysterics and paranoia. Likewise, high Electrochemistry shields the player character from the negative effects of drugs and provides knowledge on them, but may also lead to substance abuse and other self-destructive behaviors.<ref name=rockpapershotgunskills/>\n\n''Disco Elysium'' features a secondary inventory system, the Thought Cabinet.  Thoughts are unlockable through conversations with other characters, as well as through internal dialogues within the mind of the player character himself. The player is then able to \"internalize\" a thought through a certain amount of in-game hours, which, once completed, grants the player character permanent benefits but also occasionally negative effects.<ref>{{cite web |date=15 October 2019 |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/10/15/disco-elysium-thought-cabinet-the-thoughts-system-explained/#what-is-the-thought-cabinet|title=Disco Elysium Thought Cabinet: the Thoughts system explained|website=rockpapershotgun.com}}</ref>\n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Setting ===\nThe world of ''Disco Elysium'' is made of landmasses known as Isolas that are separated by the Pale, a mysterious connective tissue in which the laws of reality begin to break down. Prolonged exposure to the Pale can cause mental instability and madness. Humanity crosses it via specially built airships. Civilization in Disco Elysium is comparable to late 20th century Earth, both technologically and culturally. Nations and people within Disco Elysium follow different ideologies, including [[communism]], Traditionalism (a mix of [[fascism]] and [[monarchism]]), Ultraliberalism (a form of [[libertarianism]]) and Moralism (a form of centrist [[capitalist]] democracy).\n\n''Disco Elysium'' takes place in the fictional city of Revachol in the island chain of Insulinde, specifically in Martinaise, a district plagued by poverty, crime, and corruption.<ref name=\"PCGUS\" /> Five decades prior to the start of the game, a communist revolution took place in Revachol and successfully overthrew the old monarchy that controlled the city, forming a [[Commune (model of government)|commune]] afterwards, but it was soon toppled by an invasion of an alliance of capitalist nations calling themselves \"the Coalition\". Revachol has since been designated a Special Administrative Region under the Coalition, who holds a strong grip over the city's local economy and keeps its autonomy at a minimum. One of the few governmental functions that Revachol is allowed to handle itself is upholding day to day law and order, which is the task of the Revachol Citizens Militia (RCM). While starting out as a voluntary citizens brigade, the RCM has since grown and evolved into a semi-professional police force.\n\n=== Plot ===\n{{plot|date=March 2020}}\nThe player character, a detective of the RCM, wakes up in a trashed cafeteria motel room with a severe hangover and no memory of his own identity. He is greeted by his assigned partner Lieutenant Kim Kitsuragi, who informs him that they are investigating the death of a hanged man in the cafeteria's backyard. The man's identity is unclear and initial investigation indicates that he was [[lynched]] by a group of people. Detailed analysis however implies that he was killed before being hanged. The Hardie Boys, a group of dockworkers who act as [[vigilante]]s in Martinaise, claim collective responsibility for the murder. They assert that the man attempted to rape a cafeteria guest by the name of Klaasje; Klaasje however denies the claim of rape.\n\nIt becomes apparent that the killing is connected to a strike by Martinaise's dockworkers union against the Wild Pines corporation. The detectives meet up with the union boss Evrart Claire, who denies association with the killing. They also meet with the Wild Pines representative Joyce Messier. She reveals that the hanged man's name was 'Lely' and that he was a member of a mercenary squad assigned to protect Joyce during negotiations with the union. However, the death of Lely has driven them to go rogue. Joyce warns that unless the detectives find the true culprit soon, the mercenaries will likely enact bloody retribution across Martinaise.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the district, following up on leads to the case, investigating small cases and helping residents with tasks such as helping a group of dancers turn a church into a nightclub and helping a group of [[cryptid]] hunters look for the 'Insulidian Phasmid', a giant [[stick insect]]. Throughout the game, the player begins to fill in gaps in the detective's identity, revealing him to be Harrier \"Harry\" DuBois. A decorated RCM detective, Harry experienced an event several years ago that began a [[mid-life crisis]], eventually culminating in a self-destructive bender around Martinaise in which he dismissed the rest of his squad.\n\nKlassje reveals that Lely was shot in the mouth whist the two were having sex. Unable to figure out the origin of the bullet and fearful of involving the authorities, Klaasje enlisted the help of a dockworker named Ruby, who with the rest of the Hardie Boys staged Lely's death as a hanging. Ruby then went into hiding across the bay. The player has the options of issuing a notice for Klaasje's summons (which leads to her subsequent flight) or taking her into custody. The detectives then follow the trail across the shore and eventually find Ruby within an abandoned building, where she incapacitates them with a Pale device. She claims that the cover up was all Klaasje's idea and furthermore has no idea who shot Lely. The player manages to resist or disable the Pale device and tries to arrest her. Ruby states that she would rather kill herself, which she does if she is unable to escape.\n\nThe detectives return to find themselves in a stand off between the mercenaries and the Hardie Boys. A firefight breaks out and the player is badly wounded by the mercenary leader, blacking out and waking up a few days later. Most or all the mercenaries are killed and Kim may be hospitalized due to his wounds, in which case street urchin Cuno offers to take his place. The detectives begin chasing down their last leads, ultimately determining that the shot that killed Lely came from an old sea fort just off the shore of Martinaise.\n\nWhile at the fort, Harry has a dream in which he meets a manifestation of his ex-fianc\u00e9e Dora Ingerlund, who left Harry out of both dissatisfaction at his low income and his apparent mental instability. She then reveals that this is what drove Harry onto his emotional breakdown; he is plagued by this same dream recurring every couple of days, the moment of her leaving him and him trying and failing to win her back and unable to move on from her.\n\nThe detectives explore the rest of the fort and find the shooter: a former Commissar from the old Revachol communist army named Iosef Lilianovich Dros. Iosef's motivations are revealed to be ultimately born out of his bitterness towards the new capitalist system Lely represented, as well as his own sexual envy for Klaasje. With all of the evidence now found, the detectives arrest him for the murder. At this point, the Insulidian Phasmid appears from the reeds. The player may be able to have a psychic conversation with the Phasmid, who tells Harry that it finds the notion of his unstable mind to be fearful, but is in awe at his ability to continue existing day after day. It comforts Harry, telling him to move on from the wreck of his life and move forward. After the detectives take its picture, the Phasmid moves on.\n\nAfter returning to Martinaise, Harry and his partner are confronted by his old squad. They discuss Harry's actions during the game, reflecting on whether he has solved the case and how he handled the mercenaries, as well as being impressed by the news that the Phasmid does exist. Harry's former partner Jean Vicquemare confirms that Harry's emotional breakdown was indeed the result of Dora leaving him several years ago. If the player has done well, the squad expresses hope that Harry's state will improve in the future, and invites him and either Kim or Cuno to a special RCM unit.\n\n==Development and release==\n''Disco Elysium'' was developed by ZA/UM, a company founded in 2016 by [[Karelians|Karelian]]-[[Estonians|Estonian]] novelist [[Robert Kurvitz]], who served as the game's lead writer and designer.<ref name= Gamesindustry>{{cite web |last=Taylor |first=Haydn |date=31 October 2018 |url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-10-31-disco-elysium|title=Chasing oblivion with Disco Elysium and alcohol addiction|website=Gamesindustry.biz}}</ref><ref name= Kurvitz>{{cite web |last1=Macgregor |first1=Jody |title=Disco Elysium's lead designer wants to make an expansion and sequel, has already written a novel |url=https://www.pcgamer.com/disco-elysiums-lead-designer-wants-to-make-an-expansion-and-sequel-has-already-written-a-novel/ |website=PC Gamer |accessdate=13 November 2019}}</ref> Kurvitz had previously created the game's setting for a [[tabletop RPG]], and has also written novels, such as ''Sacred and Terrible Air'' (2013), that take place in it.<ref name= Kurvitz/> A team consisting of eight writers also assisted Kurvitz.<ref name=gamesindustry.biz>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2017-07-20-making-games-under-threat-of-nuclear-war|title=Making games under threat of nuclear war|website=GamesIndustry.biz}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Price |first1=Edward |title=Disco Elysium \u2013 Rezzed 2018 Interview |url=https://gameanalytics.com/blog/disco-elysium-rezzed-2018-interview.html |website=gameanalytics.com |accessdate=19 October 2019}}</ref> The game's original title was ''No Truce With The Furies'', but was renamed in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2018/03/09/no-truce-with-the-furies-gets-a-mad-new-title-and-trailer/|title=No Truce With The Furies gets a mad new title and trailer|first=Dominic|last=Tarason|publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=March 9, 2018}}</ref> During development, some of the staff relocated from Estonia to London, with other designers working out of [[Poland]], [[Romania]], and [[China]].<ref name=gamesindustry.biz/><ref name=Postimees>{{cite news |last1=Altk\u00fcla |first1=Magnus |title=Kaur Kender on new computer game: It\u2019s like 'Truth and Justice' |url=https://news.postimees.ee/6807443/kaur-kender-on-new-computer-game-it-s-like-truth-and-justice |publisher=[[Postimees]] |date=22 October 2019 |accessdate=29 December 2019}}</ref> Majority of the game's funding was provided by Estonian businessman {{ill|Margus Linnam\u00e4e|et|Margus Linnam\u00e4e}}.<ref name=Postimees/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://raha.geenius.ee/rubriik/uudis/kaur-kenderi-uus-videomanguari-on-neelanud-juba-700-000-eurot-investorite-raha/|title=Kaur Kenderi uus videom\u00e4ngu\u00e4ri on neelanud juba 700 000 eurot investorite raha|first=Deisi|last=Helem\u00e4e|publisher=Geenius.ee|date=5 September 2018|lang=Estonian|accessdate=30 December 2019}}</ref> ZA/UM cited a variety of different influences and inspirations for the game, including other games ''[[Planescape: Torment]]'' and ''[[Kentucky Route Zero]]''; television shows ''[[The Wire]]'', ''[[True Detective]]'' and ''[[The Shield]]''; the literary works of [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[China Mi\u00e9ville]], the [[Strugatsky brothers]], and [[\u00c9mile Zola]]; and artists [[Rembrandt]], [[Ilya Repin]], [[Jenny Saville]], [[Alex Kanevsky]], and [[Wassily Kandinsky]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://steamcommunity.com/games/632470/announcements/detail/3334287173823797601|title=Steam :: Disco Elysium :: Disco Elysium -

An eccentric [[Silicon Valley]] billionaire, using his personal wealth and resources, seizes control of the [[Chinese large modular space station|Chinese space station]] and neutralizes China's anti-satellite systems. Simultaneously, another Silicon Valley magnate wages his own separate campaign against China by using his connections to get into contact with the hacktivist group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. The group manages to launch their own cyberattack, which cripples the Directorate's cyberwarfare capabilities indefinitely. The United States' military is ultimately able to liberate Hawaii, aided by the Ghost Fleet, the [[United States Special Operations Command]] and aircraft reactivated from the [[United States Air Force]] [[Aircraft boneyard|boneyard]].

It became an international hit and reached the top ten in many countries. The song was Pink's biggest-selling song at that time. The track was released on October 9, 2001, to positive reviews. After the release of the single, it was confirmed that Pink would be releasing ''Missundaztood''.\n\n==Composition==\nThe song was composed by former [[4 Non Blondes]] frontwoman [[Linda Perry]]. She said that the process of making the song was \"so unlike me\"; according to her, she was going through a \"weird phase\" during which she wanted to learn how to program drums.<ref name=Playback/> She programmed her first beat, picked up a [[bass guitar]], and, in her words, \"did what the beat was asking me to do.\" She decided to put \"every wrong instrument\" in the song, and consequently acquired a horn sample. \"I was doing the music, the melody was already coming to me in what I wanted the song to be,\" she said.<ref name=Playback/> She finished the song by including in the song \"every catch phrase you possibly could imagine\", before laughing at the realization that she had written a potential hit single and her first [[dance music|dance]] song. \"You create something in your bedroom or your house, and it's just a fun thing that you're doing,\" she said. \"Then all of a sudden, you hear that song that you started in your house, and it's on the radio. And people are now acknowledging it. It's just trippy.\"<ref name=Playback>[http://www.ascap.com/playback/2003/fall/perry.html \"Linda Perry, High Priestess of Pop\"].

Late 2003.</ref> In 2019, Perry revealed that she had initially written the song for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], who turned it down.<ref>https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/linda-perry-my-life-in-15-songs-780874/pink-get-the-party-started-2001-780880/</ref>\n\nThe entire song uses only one chord, solidly in [[B minor]].\n\n==Critical response==\n[[AllMusic]] highlighted the song and added: \"This record bubbles over with imagination, as hooky pop songs like the title track rub shoulders with glitzy dancefloor anthems like \"Get the Party Started.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/m!ssundaztood-mw0000588530|title=M!ssundaztood - P!nk - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=AllMusic}}</ref> Jim Farber was favorable: \"The single \"Get the Party Started\" has the tricky synth hook of a perfect new-wave hit from the '80s.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,253257,00.html|title=M!ssundaztood|date=23 November 2001|publisher=}}</ref> ''[[NME]]'' was less positive: \"displays the kind of clod-hopping attention-seeking on single 'Get the Party Started' that makes you assume you're listening to a [[Geri Halliwell]] record.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/name/6038|title=Pink  : M!ssundaztood - NME|website=NME}}</ref> Jason Thompson described this song and praised: \"the dance inducing \u201cGet the Party Started\u201d. Again, even this isn\u2019t really in the mold of current dance tracks. Instead, it feels more like the kinds of grooves that were coming out in the early Nineties, when alt-rock was influencing the discos as well as the college charts. In fact, it sounds a little like [[Apollo Smile]] who had an album out back in \u201891 or so. \u201cGet the Party Started\u201d also echoes the good time vibe that other hits like [[Deee-Lite]]\u2019s \u201c[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\u201d had that won over many fans.

The single's success was spurred by heavy airplay in the US, which prompted the song to also peak at number four on Billboard's [[Hot 100 Airplay (Radio Songs)|Radio Songs]] chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/radio-songs/2001-11-17|title=Radio Music: Top Radio Songs Chart|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref> It peaked at number two in the UK, where it was narrowly denied the top spot by the posthumous release of [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\". It reached number-one in [[Australia]]  and number-two in many European countries, most notably [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]], being held off from the top position by [[Shakira]]'s smash hit \"[[Whenever, Wherever]]\".\n\n\"Get the Party Started\" was certified gold in Australia, Austria, Germany, France, [[Sweden]] and Switzerland, and in [[Norway]] it received a platinum certification. The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 2003 in the category of \"[[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]\", which it lost to [[Norah Jones]]'s \"[[Don't Know Why]]\". It won the award for \"Favorite Song\" at the [[Kids' Choice Awards]] of 2002, and at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] of 2002, it won the award for \"Best Song\". \"Get the Party Started\" is often considered one of Pink's [[signature song]]s as she tends to finish her shows with this song in her encore section along with a ballad song such as \"[[Nobody Knows (Pink song)|Nobody Knows]]\" and \"Glitter In The Air\". In December, the song was listed as number 81 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Top Songs of the 2000s.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was shot by director [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The video uses an abbreviated version of the song, cutting out the last chorus, and also cutting out the instrumentals. The song's composer, Linda Perry, is seen as a bartender.\n\nIn the video, Pink is getting ready to go out, trying on different outfits. One of her friends picks her up, and they drive in a car bobbing their heads to the music. However, the car runs out of fuel, so they get out and steal two skateboards from two boys. Pink falls off her skateboard because men in a car are whistling at her. The women arrive at the club but are refused entry, so to get in they use a scaffold to reach the top of the building. Inside the club, Pink changes her clothes and starts to party; in the end Pink dances with two other dancers ([[Kevin Federline]] and Georvohn Lambert).\n\nThe video was nominated at the 2002 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]]\" and won the awards for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]]\" and \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video|Best Dance Video]]\".\n\n==Remixes==\n[[Pink (singer)|Pink]] teamed up with [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and [[Rockwilder]] for a remix of \"Get the Party Started\", using elements of the [[Eurythmics]] song \"[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) (song)|Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]\". The remix was released as a single only in [[France]], where it reached number four and was certified gold. Pink performed the remix during her [[I'm Not Dead Tour]] in 2006 and 2007. The remix was also featured on the [[Now That's What I Call Music! 9 (U.S. series)|9th installment]] of the U.S. version of the ''[[Now That's What I Call Music!]]'' series.\n\n==Track listing==\n* '''UK CD1''' and '''Cassette'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Pnk-Get-The-Party-Started/release/2138820|title=P!nk -

It became an international hit and reached the top ten in many countries. The song was Pink's biggest-selling song at that time. The track was released on October 9, 2001, to positive reviews. After the release of the single, it was confirmed that Pink would be releasing ''Missundaztood''.\n\n==Writing==\nThe song was composed by former [[4 Non Blondes]] frontwoman [[Linda Perry]]. She said that the process of making the song was \"so unlike me\"; according to her, she was going through a \"weird phase\" during which she wanted to learn how to program drums.<ref name=Playback/> She programmed her first beat, picked up a [[bass guitar]], and, in her words, \"did what the beat was asking me to do.\" She decided to put \"every wrong instrument\" in the song, and consequently acquired a horn sample. \"I was doing the music, the melody was already coming to me in what I wanted the song to be,\" she said.<ref name=Playback/> She finished the song by including in the song \"every catch phrase you possibly could imagine\", before laughing at the realization that she had written a potential hit single and her first [[dance music|dance]] song. \"You create something in your bedroom or your house, and it's just a fun thing that you're doing,\" she said. \"Then all of a sudden, you hear that song that you started in your house, and it's on the radio. And people are now acknowledging it. It's just trippy.\"<ref name=Playback>[http://www.ascap.com/playback/2003/fall/perry.html \"Linda Perry, High Priestess of Pop\"].

In fact, it sounds a little like [[Apollo Smile]] who had an album out back in \u201891 or so. \u201cGet the Party Started\u201d also echoes the good time vibe that other hits like [[Deee-Lite]]\u2019s \u201c[[Groove Is in the Heart]]\u201d had that won over many fans.

The single's success was spurred by heavy airplay in the US, which prompted the song to also peak at number four on Billboard's [[Hot 100 Airplay (Radio Songs)|Radio Songs]] chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/radio-songs/2001-11-17|title=Radio Music: Top Radio Songs Chart|work=Billboard|access-date=2017-08-28}}</ref> It peaked at number two in the UK, where it was narrowly denied the top spot by the posthumous release of [[George Harrison]]'s \"[[My Sweet Lord]]\". It reached number-one in [[Australia]]  and number-two in many European countries, most notably [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]] and [[Switzerland]], being held off from the top position by [[Shakira]]'s smash hit \"[[Whenever, Wherever]]\".\n\n\"Get the Party Started\" was certified gold in Australia, Austria, Germany, France, [[Sweden]] and Switzerland, and in [[Norway]] it received a platinum certification. The song was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 2003 in the category of \"[[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]\", which it lost to [[Norah Jones]]'s \"[[Don't Know Why]]\". It won the award for \"Favorite Song\" at the [[Kids' Choice Awards]] of 2002, and at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] of 2002, it won the award for \"Best Song\". \"Get the Party Started\" is often considered one of Pink's [[signature song]]s as she tends to finish her shows with this song in her encore section along with a ballad song such as \"[[Nobody Knows (Pink song)|Nobody Knows]]\" and \"Glitter In The Air\". In December, the song was listed as number 81 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Top Songs of the 2000s.\n\n==Music video==\nThe [[music video]] was shot by director [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]] in [[Los Angeles]]. The video uses an abbreviated version of the song, cutting out the last chorus, and also cutting out the instrumentals. The song's composer, Linda Perry, is seen as a bartender.\n\nIn the video, Pink is getting ready to go out, trying on different outfits. One of her friends picks her up, and they drive in a car bobbing their heads to the music. However, the car runs out of fuel, so they get out and steal two skateboards from two boys. Pink falls off her skateboard because men in a car are whistling at her. The women arrive at the club but are refused entry, so to get in they use a scaffold to reach the top of the building. Inside the club, Pink changes her clothes and starts to party; in the end Pink dances with two other dancers ([[Kevin Federline]] and Georvohn Lambert).\n\nThe video was nominated at the 2002 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Pop Video|Best Pop Video]]\" and won the awards for \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]]\" and \"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Dance Video|Best Dance Video]]\".\n\n==Remixes==\n[[Pink (singer)|Pink]] teamed up with [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]] and [[Rockwilder]] for a remix of \"Get the Party Started\", using elements of the [[Eurythmics]] song \"[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) (song)|Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]\". The remix was released as a single only in [[France]], where it reached number four and was certified gold. Pink performed the remix during her [[I'm Not Dead Tour]] in 2006 and 2007. The remix was also featured on the [[Now That's What I Call Music! 9 (U.S. series)|9th installment]] of the U.S. version of the ''[[Now That's What I Call Music!]]'' series.\n\n==Track listing==\n* '''UK CD1''' and '''Cassette'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Pnk-Get-The-Party-Started/release/2138820|title=P!nk -

The NLD subscribes to thousands of [[e-journal]]s, [[e-book]]s and other e-resource sites and has a stock of specialized collection of government publications dating back to 1980. In addition it also acts as a data information centre for the [[World Bank]].\n\n==History==\nThe Kenya National Library Service (KNLS) came to existence after independence as the nation was crafting its road map for growth and development. Poverty, illiteracy and disease were identified as major impediments to development and there was need to identify vehicles of development that would help deal with these challenges.\n\nThe report recommending a centralized state-supported public library system for Kenya was made in 1960. After three years, Kenya gained independence and two years later an act establishing Kenya National Library Service was passed. The mandate of KNLS was to promote, establish, equip, manage, maintain, and develop libraries in Kenya as a National Library Service.\n\nPublic libraries in Kenya have existed since the beginning of the 18th century.

Something must have been left out.|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Role of national and public libraries in Kenyan community development==\nNational and public libraries play a critical role in the provision of information for development. Through these libraries, communities have been empowered to fight poverty, deprivation and illiteracy and thus support reading and recovery programmes by the government. Rural and urban poor communities are better able to tackle their problems and introduce social change if they have access to relevant information that meets their needs and interests. In addition, access to information about the country enables citizens to participate effectively in the art of governance.\n\nThrough various reading campaigns, KNLS has provided opportunities for communities to enhance their reading and information-seeking habits, and therefore sustain literacy. The 2006 Kenya National Adult Literacy Survey estimated the national literacy rate at 61.5% indicating that only 38.5% Kenyan adults were illiterate. The survey also revealed that only 29.6% of the adult population had acquired the desired mastery level of literacy. This meant that the majority of those termed as literate (61.5%) were at risk of losing their literacy skills or could not effectively perform within the context of knowledge economies.\n\nHowever, a country with effective library and information services will achieve continuity in learning and reading beyond the formal school programme. Such systems cannot be explained any better than ensuring that library services are accessible to as many Kenyans as possible throughout the country. Public libraries go beyond formal education and they are at the heart of personal and community development. KNLS promotes reading by providing access to relevant reading materials to all communities. Libraries play a major role in stimulating public interest in books and in promoting reading for knowledge, information and enjoyment \u2013 thus KNLS is indeed a \"people's university.\"\n\nKenya is indeed working towards becoming an industrialized nation through their blueprint dubbed \"Vision 2030\". Various flagship projects have been undertaken and very many others are underway. The KNLS has a major role to play in linking the pillars of development identified through bridging the knowledge gap. Similarly, they have also undertaken various projects for expansion and modernization of their facilities.\n\nLibraries have played an instrumental role in transforming livelihoods through provision of information resources. To achieve this objective, the Kenya National Libraries Service (KNLS) has partnered with other institutions like [[Book Aid International]] in the acquisition of information materials and supporting reading culture among Kenyan communities. Empowering farmers, a partnership between KNLS and the Ministry of Agriculture, through National Farmers Information Service (NAFIS) has made it possible for farmers to access online information services regarding farming activities (i.e. crop farming and animal farming) and also know the prevailing market prices for their produce. In addition, farmers have access to an online extension officer who responds to any of their queries. Another major step in the provision of information has been the partnership entered between KNLS and the [[Communications Authority of Kenya|Communication Authority of Kenya]] (CA) formerly known as Communications Commission of Kenya (CCK) with an aim of developing e-Resource centres in all rural libraries. This will be very instrumental in the provision of access to information for all. Kenya as a country has demonstrated the commitment to improve education, create opportunities and empower communities through the digital platform. Various mechanisms have been identified in order to achieve this goal, and ensuring that rural citizens have access to computers and internet services, is a major milestone. Many other partners continue to support libraries in Kenya and some of them include EIFL, Safaricom, Finlays, Practical Action, KASNEB, American Embassy and Goethe Institut among others.\n\nLibraries will be instrumental in the achievement of Kenya's Vision 2030 and the government acknowledges that. This is clearly demonstrated by the commitment of the government in funding an ultra-modern facility which will cost the nation KShs 2.5 billion, which will be a landmark information resource centre.\n\n==Core functions of the KNLS Board==\nThe core functions of the KNLS Board are:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knls.ac.ke/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=87&Itemid=158|title=About Us|website=Kenya National Library Service|accessdate=October 5, 2018}}</ref>\n* Preservation and conservation the national imprint for reference and research and maintain the National Bibliographic Control through Issuance of the ISBN, publication of the Kenya National Bibliography and Kenya Periodicals Directory.\n* Promote, establish, equip, manage and maintain the National and Public libraries services in Kenya;\n* Promote information literacy and reading among Kenyans; \n* Enhance stakeholders participation for equitable development of libraries throughout the country;\n* Advise the Government, local authorities and other public bodies on all matters relating to library, documentation and related services.\n\n==Services==\nThrough the public library, the library offers these services;\n* Adult, junior and institutional lending\n* Inter-library lending\n* Advisory on library services\n* Technical assistance on library development to interested government and private institutions\n* Internet services in the libraries that are connected\n* Health information\n* Services to visually impaired persons\n* User education\n\n==Accessibility - hours of operation==\nAll KNLS libraries are open to the public as follows:\n\n* '''Monday - Friday 8:00&nbsp;am to 6:00&nbsp;pm'''\n* '''Saturday 8:30&nbsp;am to 5:00&nbsp;pm'''\n* The libraries remain closed on '''Sundays and public holidays'''\n* Administration offices are open from '''8:00&nbsp;am to 5:00&nbsp;pm''' from Monday to Friday\n\nExcept in known insecurity-prone areas where closing time may be dictated by other factors on the ground, the above remain as the hours of operation.

Poverty, illiteracy and disease were identified as major impediments to development and there was need to identify vehicles of development that would help deal with these challenges.\n\nThe report recommending a centralized state-supported public library system for Kenya was made in 1960. After three years, Kenya gained independence and two years later an act establishing Kenya National Library Service was passed. The mandate of KNLS was to promote, establish, equip, manage, maintain, and develop libraries in Kenya as a National Library Service.\n\nPublic libraries in Kenya have existed since the beginning of the 18th century. These however, were mainly subscription libraries that relied heavily on endowments, members' subscriptions and limited grants from both local and central government. The libraries were exclusively for Europeans and Asians. The first public library, [[Seif Bin Salim Public Library and Free Reading Area]] in [[Mombasa]], was established in 1903.

What's really for dinner? The truth about commercial pet food. The Animals' Agenda. 1996. Nov. - Dec.</ref> \n\n==History==\nThe idea of preparing specialized food for cats came later than for dogs (see [[dog biscuit]]s and [[dog food]]). This was likely due to the idea that cats could readily fend for themselves. In 1837, a French writer Mauny de Mornay critiqued this idea:\n\n{{quote|text=It is... thought wrongly that the cat, ill-fed, hunts better and takes more mice; this too is a grave error. The cat who is not given food is feeble and sickly; as soon as he has bitten into a mouse, he lies down to rest and sleep; while well fed, he is wide awake and satisfies his natural taste in chasing all that belongs to the rat family.<ref>Mauny de Mornay, ''Livre de l'eleveur et du proprietaire d'animaux domestiques'' 1837 https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&pg=PA287&id=tBkGwxXqxpgC&num=100&as_brr=1&f=false</ref>}}\n\nIn 1844, another French writer{{Who|date=February 2015}} expanded on this idea:\n{{quote|text=Normally in the country no care is taken of a cat's food, and he is left to live, it is said, from his hunting, but when he is hungry, he hunts the pantry's provisions far more than the mouse; because he does not pursue them and never watches them by need, but by instinct and attraction. And so, to neglect feeding a cat, is to render him at the same time useless and harmful, while with a few scraps regularly and properly given, the cat will never do any damage, and will render much service.<ref>Nicolas Jean Baptiste Boyard, ''Manuel du bouvier et zoophile: ou l'art d'\u00e9lever de soigner les animaux '' 1844 https://books.google.com/books?pg=RA2-PA328&id=ODpFAAAAYAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1&q=intitle%3A%22animaux%20domestiques%22%20chat&f=false</ref>}}\n\nHe goes on to say that it is all the more unreasonable to expect a cat to live from hunting in that cats take mice more for amusement than to eat: \"A good cat takes many and eats few\".\n\nBy 1876, Gordon Stables emphasized the need to give cats particular food:\n\n{{quote|text=If then, only for the sake of making (a cat) more valuable as a vermin-killer, she ought to have regular and sufficient food. A cat ought to be fed at least twice a day. Let her have a dish to herself, put down to her, and removed when the meal is finished. [[Experience is the best teacher]] as regards the quantity of a cat's food, and in quality let it be varied. Oatmeal porridge and milk, or white bread steeped in warm milk, to which a little sugar has been added, are both excellent breakfasts for puss; and for dinner she must have an allowance of flesh. Boiled lights are better for her than horse-meat, and occasionally let her have fish. Teach your cat to wait patiently till she is served\u2014a spoiled cat is nearly as disagreeable as a spoiled child. If you want to have your cat nice and clean, treat her now and then to a square inch of fresh butter. It not only acts as a gentle laxative, but, the grease, combining in her mouth, with the alkalinity of her saliva, forms a kind of natural cat-soap, and you will see she will immediately commence washing herself, and become beautifully clean. (N.B.\u2014If you wish to have a cat nicely done up for showing, touch her all over with a sponge dipped in fresh cream, when she licks herself the effect is wonderful.)\n\nRemember that too much flesh-meat, especially liver,\u2014which ought only to be given occasionally,\u2014is very apt to induce a troublesome diarrhoea (looseness). Do not give your pet too many tit-bits at table; but whatever else you give her, never neglect to let her have her ''two regular meals''.<ref>Gordon Stables,'' 'Cats': their points and characteristics, with Curiosities of cat life, and ...'' 1876 https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA371&id=iUUDAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=0&q=cat%20food%20%22cat%20food%22&f=false</ref>}}\n\nIn the same year, an advertisement for [[Spratt's|Spratt]] (better known for making dog food) said that their cat food entirely superseded \"the unwholesome practice of feeding on boiled horse flesh; keeps the cat in perfect health.\"<ref>ad for Spratt's https://books.google.com/books?id=5-ANAAAAQAAJ&pg=PP8</ref> And, in another book on cats, Stables recommended the company's food:\n\n{{quote|text=Attend to the feeding, and, at a more than one-day show, cats ought to have ''water'' as well as milk. I think boiled [[Lights (offal)|lights]], cut into small pieces, with a very small portion of bullock's liver and bread soaked, is the best food; but I have tried Spratt's Patent Cat Food with a great number of cats, both of my own and those of friends, and have nearly always found it agree; and at a cat show it would, I believe, be both handy and cleanly.<ref>Gordon Stable, ''The domestic cat'', 1876, 61 https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&pg=PA61&id=30oDAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1&f=false</ref>}}\n\nSpratt, which began by making dog biscuits, appears to also have been the first commercial producer of cat food.\n\nDuring the 19th century and early 20th centuries, meat for cats and dogs in London, frequently [[horse meat]], was sold from barrows (hand\u2013carts) by itinerant traders known as ''Cats' Meat Men''.<ref name=\":18\">{{cite web | url=http://www.museumoflondonprints.com/image/68598/john-galt-cats-meat-man-c-1901 | title=Cats' Meat Man: c.1901 | publisher=Museum of London | accessdate=October 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Natural diet ==\nCats are obligate [[carnivore]]s\u2014meaning, they are true carnivores and depend upon the nutrients present in animal flesh for their dietary needs. Even domesticated cats will relish freshly killed meat from rodents, rabbits, amphibians, birds, reptiles and fish, but cats are also opportunistic feeders and will readily take cooked food<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.timeforpaws.co.uk/blog/wild-cats/|title = Wild Cats Survive - Time for Paws - Time for Paws|website = Time for Paws|language = en-GB|access-date = 2016-03-08}}</ref> as well as dried cat food when offered, if that food is palatable. The natural diet of cats therefore does not include any vegetable matter, although cats have been known to eat certain plants and grasses occasionally, usually as an [[Vomiting|emetic]].\n\nCats cannot synthesize some essential nutrients required for survival, including the amino acids [[taurine]] and [[arginine]], so these nutrients must be sourced from fresh meat in the natural diet. Cats lack the specific physiology to extract nutrients efficiently from plant-based materials, and require a high protein diet, which is why high-energy meats from freshly killed prey are optimal foods.\n\n==Packaging and labeling==\n{{further|Pet food#Labeling and regulation}}\nIn the United States, cat foods labeled as \"complete and balanced\" must meet standards established by the [[Association of American Feed Control Officials]] (AAFCO) either by meeting a nutrient profile or by passing a feeding trial. Cat Food Nutrient Profiles were established in 1992 and updated in 2014 by the AAFCO's Feline Nutrition Expert Subcommittee. The updated profiles replaced the previous recommendations set by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC). Certain manufacturers label their products with terms such as premium, ultra premium, natural and holistic. Such terms currently have no legal definitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petfood.aafco.org/Labeling-Labeling-Requirements|title=The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) > Labeling & Labeling Requirements|website=petfood.aafco.org|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> However, \"While most of the food supplied comes from within the US, the FDA ensures that standards are met within our borders even when components come from countries with less stringent levels of safety or label integrity.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://petfoodtalk.com/catfoodreviews/#cat-food | title = Cat Food Reviews: The Pleasure of Their Company | publisher=petfoodtalk.com}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial cat food diets==\n\nMost store-bought cat food comes in either dry form, also known in the US as ''kibble'', or wet canned form. Some manufacturers sell frozen raw diets and premix products to cater to owners who [[raw feeding|feed raw]].\n\n===Dry food diet===\n[[File:Katzenfutter.JPG|left|thumb|Dry (extruded) cat food example]]\nDry food (8\u201310% moisture) is generally made by [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] cooking under high heat and pressure. Fat may then be sprayed on the food to increase [[palatability]], and other minor ingredients, such as heat-sensitive vitamins, which would be destroyed in the extrusion process, may be added. Dry food is most often packed in multi-wall [[paper bag]]s, sometimes with a [[plastic film]] layer; similar bag styles with film laminates or coextrusions are also used.\n\n===Wet food diet===\n[[File:Canned Cat Food1.jpg|right|thumb|Wet (canned) cat food example (Fish flakes in jelly)]]\nIn much of Europe, the UK and the US, [[canning|canned]] or wet food (75\u201378% moisture) generally comes in aluminum or steel cans in 3 [[ounce|oz]] (85 g), 5.5 oz (156 g), and 13 oz (369 g) sizes. It is also sold in foil pouch form\n\n===Renal diet===\n{{main|Renal diet}}\nA [[renal diet]] is formulated for cats that are living with chronic kidney disease, or CKD.

Weight gain means more energy is being consumed than is being expended in exercise and other functions. A weight management diet is designed to allow fewer calories to be consumed in a larger volume of food, allowing for less risk of an energy imbalance. \n\nAdult cats should be fed a diet that promotes maintaining a healthy weight, while at the same time meeting the individual taste preference of the cat. Cats generally prefer to eat smaller meals more frequently, which can lead to less weight gain compared to cats that are fed free-choice (always available) food. Meanwhile, some cats adapt to free-choice feeding and can maintain normal body weight with no weight gain.<ref name=\":6\" /> In general, indoor cats have less opportunity or need for exercise than outdoor cats; indoor cats are much more prone to weight gain. For indoor cats, there are a variety of choices to promote exercise, including various cat toys designed to stimulate chase and play behaviours.<ref name=\":6\" /> Overall, if an adult cat cannot maintain normal body condition on a free-choice feeding diet, despite exercise levels, portion-controlled feeding is recommended. Many pet cats are fed energy-dense, high carbohydrate diets, which provide much more energy than needed. This is a major issue with indoor cats as it has been shown to lead to obesity. To prevent cats from becoming overweight, owners should be more inclined to implement weight control diets, which provide the cat with nutrient-dense, low energy ingredients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spofford|first=N|date=2014|title=A moderate fat, low-energy dry expanded diet reduces gain in body condition score when fed as part of a post neutering weight-control regimen in growing pet cats|url=|journal=Journal of Nutritional Science|volume=3|pages=e40|doi=10.1017/jns.2014.48|pmid=26101609|pmc=4473151}}</ref> Studies show that cats fed lower energy diets have significantly reduced incidences of obesity, as the typical indoor pet cat does not need more energy than their resting energy requirement. For an average cat weighing 10-11 pounds (about 5&nbsp;kg), it would have a resting energy requirement of 180-200 kcal/day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Montes de Oca|first=M|date=2017|title=Prediction equations for metabolizable and digestible energy in feline diets|url=|journal=Animal Feed Science and Technology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAlong with energy input and output, specific nutrients can be important in weight control diets. Fiber is an important component that helps control weight, along with various other benefits. A source of soluble and fermentable fiber helps to increase the movement of digesta through the gut and decrease gastric emptying. This helps to increase satiety in cats, potentially decreasing feeding rates and voluntary energy consumption. Fermentable fiber promotes healthy mucosa and [[commensal bacteria]]l growth and improved digestion/nutrient absorption. Prebiotic fibers like [[fructooligosaccharide]]s (FOS) and mannonoligosaccharides (MOS) decrease the number of pathogenic bacteria and increase the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut. They also help to maintain microbial balance and a healthy immune system. Fiber is fermented in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids which can be used as an energy source. Fermentable fiber has been demonstrated to enhance general health and decrease inflammation.<ref name=\":18\" /> Furthermore, non-fermentable fiber is critical to the formation of well-formed stool, and has been known to increase diet bulk while decreasing caloric density. Insoluble fiber has been proposed to regulate appetite by releasing hormones that reduce hunger. Sources of fiber commonly added in weight management cat food include beet pulp, barley, [[psyllium]] and [[cellulose]].\n\nAnother nutrient important for weight control diets is protein and its component amino acids. Felines, being obligate carnivores, require a natural diet of animal products which consists of protein and fat (i.e. muscle, organs and animal tissue). Dietary protein supplies amino acids that can be utilized and metabolised as energy before using fat stores,  even though protein is not stored in the body the same way as fat.<ref name=\":6\" /> Dietary fat is more efficiently converted to body fat than protein; if an animal is consuming more than its energy requirement and if the excess energy is provided by fat, more weight will be gained than if the excess calories are coming from protein.<ref name=\":6\" /> Dietary protein also improves satiety during feed, resulting in decreased overconsumption of food.<ref name=\":6\" /> The protein content of the diet is a key factor in building and maintaining lean body (muscle) mass, which is an important aspect of weight control. Lean body mass maintenance is regulated by protein intake, but more importantly is regulated by exercise. Limited protein and amino acids in the diet will limit lean body mass growth, but exercise or lack of exercise will allow growth or shrinking of muscle. Successful weight control involves maintenance of healthy adipose tissue levels, but most importantly maintenance of lean body mass. Lean muscle is the driver of basal energy metabolism and aids in the use of energy. When sufficient levels of fat are provided, fat will be used by the body as an energy source, but only when there are insufficient levels of protein.\n\nAn important amino acid that is incorporated many weight loss/weight control diets is [[L-carnitine]]. This is a vitamin-like substance that is found in animal protein. It can be found in ingredients commonly used in more commercial pet foods, but specifically weight management/weight loss diets. L-carnitine is involved in many biological pathways, more specifically fatty acid metabolism, allowing for the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into energy. The introduction of L-carnitine ensures rapid transport and oxidation of fatty acids as well as efficient usage of dietary fatty acids and protein. Supplementary L-carnitine is used more often in weight loss diets, since its benefits mainly involve fatty acid metabolism to control weight loss. However, since weight control is, in essence, a prevention stage in overall weight management, it still has value in weight control diets in preserving and building lean body mass and inhibiting the storage of excess dietary fat. The majority of studies focusing on supplementary L-carnitine use look at its benefits for weight loss, including its effect on metabolic rate and fatty acid oxidation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Center|first=SA|date=2012|title=Influence of dietary supplementation with (L)-carnitine on metabolic rate, fatty acid oxidation, body condition and weight loss in overweight cats|url=|journal=Cornell University: Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine|volume=73|issue=7|pages=1012\u20131015|pmid=22738052|doi=10.2460/ajvr.73.7.1002}}</ref> At the same time, these studies still show similar results that prove their{{clarify|date=December 2017}} effects of controlling fatty acid metabolism for weight control, to avoid the need for weight loss diets.\n\n===Grain-free diet===\nGrain free cat food substitutes the typical carbohydrate sources like wheat, corn or rice with alternative sources such as white potato, peas, sweet potato or tapioca. \n\nA study published in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery in 2018 compared the carbohydrate content between grain-free diets and diets containing grains. According to this study the proportion of cat food purchased that is grain free has increased from 4% to 9% between 2012\u20132014. <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Prantil|first=Lori R.|last2=Heinze|first2=Cailin R.|last3=Freeman|first3=Lisa M.|date=2017-06-01|title=Comparison of carbohydrate content between grain-containing and grain-free dry cat diets and between reported and calculated carbohydrate values|journal=Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery|volume=20|issue=4|pages=349\u2013355|language=en|doi=10.1177/1098612X17710842|pmid=28569080}}</ref> The researchers at Tufts University analyzed the nutritional information and contents of 77 different dry cat food diets. 42 of these diets contained grain, while 35 were labeled as grain free. The major ingredients and amounts were determined for each diet and then analyses were conducted comparing the two groups. It was found that the grain free diets had a lower mean carbohydrate content than the diets containing grain; however, there was a very wide range and lots of overlap between the two groups in both their carbohydrate contents. Sone grain free diets even had a higher amount of carbohydrates than the diets containing grain. Calorie amounts were similar for both diets. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nA recent study published by the FDA has potentially linked grain free diets to [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] in both dogs and cats.

Plant sources do not contain enough of these. Vegetarian pet food companies try to correct these deficiencies by adding synthetically produced nutrients.<ref name=\"VT\"/>\n\nCats on a vegan diet can develop abnormally [[alkaline]] (high [[pH]]) urine as plant-based proteins are more alkaline than the meat-based foods which cats have evolved to eat. When the urine becomes too alkaline, there is an increased risk of formation of [[struvite]] (also known as magnesium ammonium phosphate) bladder crystals and/or stones. Calcium oxalate stones can also occur if the urine is too acidic. Such stones can create irritation and infection of the urinary tract and require veterinary treatment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/vegan_cats |title=Vegan Cats |publisher=Veganhealth.org |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>\n\nOrganizations that advocate vegan or vegetarian diets for people have split opinions regarding vegetarian or vegan cat food.

Biosynthesis of niacin occurs by metabolism of tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway to quinolinic acid, the niacin precursor. However, cats have a high activity of picolinic acid carboxylase, which converts one of the intermediates to picolinic acid instead of quinolinic acid. As a result, niacin can become deficient and require supplementation.\n\n===Arginine===\n{{see|urea cycle}}\nCats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal. Arginine is an essential additive in cat food because cats have low levels of the enzymes which are responsible for the synthesis of [[ornithine]] and [[citrulline]] in the small intestine (specifically, for [[pyrroline-5-carboxylate]] production).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rogers | first1 = QR | last2 = Phang | first2 = JM | year = 1985 | title = Deficiency of pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase in the intestinal mucosa of the cat | url = | journal = J Nutr | volume = 115 | issue = 1| pages = 146\u201350 | doi = 10.1093/jn/115.1.146 }}</ref> Citrulline would typically go on to the kidneys to make arginine, but because cats have a deficiency in the enzymes that make it, citrulline is not produced in adequate quantities to make arginine. Arginine is essential in the urea cycle in order to convert the toxic component ammonia into urea that can then be excreted in the urine. Because of its essential role, deficiency in arginine results in a buildup of toxic ammonia and leads to [[hyperammonemia]]. The symptoms of hyperammonemia include lethargy, vomiting, ataxia, and hyperesthesia, and can be serious enough to induce death and coma in a matter of days if a cat is being fed an arginine-free diet. The quick onset of these symptoms is due to the fact that diets devoid in arginine will typically still contain all of the other amino acids, which will continue to be catabolized by the body, producing mass amounts of ammonia that very quickly build up with no way of being excreted.\n\n=== Zinc ===\nZinc's connection to skin and coat health is due to its influence on regulating cellular

many different categories.<ref name=\"book2\" /> Fatty acids can become attached to different molecules like carbohydrates or proteins and can elicit a wide range of functions in the body.<ref name=\"book2\" /> Some of those functions include: providing long-term energy storage, insulation (prevents heat loss, protects vital organs, helps transmit nerve impulses faster), structure, transportation around the body for nutrients and other biological molecules, and can also be precursors to other compounds in the body such as hormones (some of which are important for

The main complaint is excessive scratching ([[pruritus]]) which is usually resistant to treatment by [[Glucocorticoid|steroidal]] [[anti-inflammatory]] [[medication|drugs]]. The exact prevalence of food allergy in cats remains unknown. In 20 to 30% of the cases, cats have concurrent allergic diseases ([[atopy]]/flea-allergic [[dermatitis]]). A reliable diagnosis can only be made with [[Elimination diet|dietary elimination-challenge trials]]. [[Food allergy|Allergy]] [[Allergy testing|testing]] is necessary for the identification of the causative food component(s). Therapy consists of avoiding the offending food component(s).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Verlinden A, Hesta M, Millet S, Janssens GP |title=Food allergy in dogs and cats: a review |journal=Crit Rev Food Sci Nutr |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=259\u201373 |year=2006 |pmid=16527756 |doi=10.1080/10408390591001117 }}</ref>\n\n== Malnutrition ==\nMalnutrition can be a problem for cats fed non-conventional diets. Cats fed exclusively on raw, [[freshwater fish]] can develop a [[thiamine]] deficiency. Those fed exclusively on liver may develop [[vitamin A]] toxicity. Also, exclusively meat-based diets may contain excessive [[protein]] and [[phosphorus]] whilst being deficient in [[calcium]], [[vitamin E]], and [[microminerals]] such as [[copper]], [[zinc]], and [[potassium]]. [[Energy density]] must also be maintained relative to the other [[nutrients]].

Overall, several major companies recalled more than 100 brands of pet foods with most of the recalled product coming from Menu Foods. The most likely cause according to the FDA is the presence of [[melamine]] in the wheat gluten of the affected foods. Melamine is known to falsely inflate the protein content rating of substances in laboratory tests. The economic impact on the pet food market has been extensive, with Menu Foods alone losing roughly $30 million from the recall. Some companies were not affected and utilized the situation to generate sales for alternative pet foods.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.newsweek.com/capitalizing-pet-food-panic-101439|title = CAPITALIZING ON PET-FOOD PANIC|date = 2007-05-07|access-date = |website = }}</ref>\n\n=== Bisphenol A ===\nA 2004 study reported that food packaged in cans coated with [[bisphenol A]] is correlated with the development of [[hyperthyroidism]] in cats.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Edinboro|first=Charlotte H.|author2=Scott-Moncrieff, Catharine|author3=Janovitz, Evan|author4=Thacker, Leon|author5=Glickman, Larry T.|date=March 2004|title=Epidemiologic study of relationships between consumption of commercial canned food and risk of hyperthyroidism in cats|journal=[[Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association]]|volume=224|issue=6|pages=879\u201386|doi=10.2460/javma.2004.224.879|pmid=15070058|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/5b566d8fdb56f18898f109058a7b625762764878}}</ref>\n\n==Environmental impact==\n{{further|Overfishing}}\n{{See also|Environmental effects of meat production}}\nIn a study on the impacts of the pet food industry on world fish and seafood supplies, researchers estimate that 2.48 million metric tonnes of fish are used by the cat food industry each year.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=De Silva SS, Turchini GM |title=Towards Understanding the Impacts of the Pet Food Industry on World Fish and Seafood Supplies |journal=Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=459\u201367 |date=October 2008 |doi=10.1007/s10806-008-9109-6  }}</ref><ref>[http://www.petfoodindustry.com/ViewNews.aspx?id=22588 Cats taking a bite out of world fish supply] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114120956/http://www.petfoodindustry.com/ViewNews.aspx?id=22588 |date=2009-01-14 }} Petfood Industry News</ref> It was suggested that there needs to be \"a more objective and pragmatic approach to the use of a limited and decreasing biological resource, for human benefit.\" [[Marine conservation]] activist [[Paul Watson]] argues that the reduction in [[forage fish]] such as those commonly used in cat food (sardines, herring, anchovy etc.) negatively affects fish higher up the food chain like cod, tuna and swordfish, not to mention marine mammals and birds.<ref>[http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/editorial-080828-1.html Aqua Cats Are Eating the Oceans] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223225656/http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/editorial-080828-1.html |date=2009-02-23 }} Paul Watson, Sea Shepherd Conservation Society</ref>\n\nBased on 2004 numbers, cats in the US consume the caloric equivalent of what 192,000 ([[Demographics of the United States#Vital statistics|0.0655187%]]) Americans consume.

What's really for dinner? The truth about commercial pet food. The Animals' Agenda. 1996. Nov. - Dec.</ref> \n\n==History==\nThe idea of preparing specialized food for cats came later than for dogs (see [[dog biscuit]]s and [[dog food]]). This was likely due to the idea that cats could readily fend for themselves. In 1837, a French writer Mauny de Mornay critiqued this idea:\n\n{{quote|text=It is... thought wrongly that the cat, ill-fed, hunts better and takes more mice; this too is a grave error. The cat who is not given food is feeble and sickly; as soon as he has bitten into a mouse, he lies down to rest and sleep; while well fed, he is wide awake and satisfies his natural taste in chasing all that belongs to the rat family.<ref>Mauny de Mornay, ''Livre de l'eleveur et du proprietaire d'animaux domestiques'' 1837 https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&pg=PA287&id=tBkGwxXqxpgC&num=100&as_brr=1&f=false</ref>}}\n\nIn 1844, another French writer{{Who|date=February 2015}} expanded on this idea:\n{{quote|text=Normally in the country no care is taken of a cat's food, and he is left to live, it is said, from his hunting, but when he is hungry, he hunts the pantry's provisions far more than the mouse; because he does not pursue them and never watches them by need, but by instinct and attraction. And so, to neglect feeding a cat, is to render him at the same time useless and harmful, while with a few scraps regularly and properly given, the cat will never do any damage, and will render much service.<ref>Nicolas Jean Baptiste Boyard, ''Manuel du bouvier et zoophile: ou l'art d'\u00e9lever de soigner les animaux '' 1844 https://books.google.com/books?pg=RA2-PA328&id=ODpFAAAAYAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1&q=intitle%3A%22animaux%20domestiques%22%20chat&f=false</ref>}}\n\nHe goes on to say that it is all the more unreasonable to expect a cat to live from hunting in that cats take mice more for amusement than to eat: \"A good cat takes many and eats few\".\n\nBy 1876, Gordon Stables emphasized the need to give cats particular food:\n\n{{quote|text=If then, only for the sake of making (a cat) more valuable as a vermin-killer, she ought to have regular and sufficient food. A cat ought to be fed at least twice a day. Let her have a dish to herself, put down to her, and removed when the meal is finished. [[Experience is the best teacher]] as regards the quantity of a cat's food, and in quality let it be varied. Oatmeal porridge and milk, or white bread steeped in warm milk, to which a little sugar has been added, are both excellent breakfasts for puss; and for dinner she must have an allowance of flesh. Boiled lights are better for her than horse-meat, and occasionally let her have fish. Teach your cat to wait patiently till she is served\u2014a spoiled cat is nearly as disagreeable as a spoiled child. If you want to have your cat nice and clean, treat her now and then to a square inch of fresh butter. It not only acts as a gentle laxative, but, the grease, combining in her mouth, with the alkalinity of her saliva, forms a kind of natural cat-soap, and you will see she will immediately commence washing herself, and become beautifully clean. (N.B.\u2014If you wish to have a cat nicely done up for showing, touch her all over with a sponge dipped in fresh cream, when she licks herself the effect is wonderful.)\n\nRemember that too much flesh-meat, especially liver,\u2014which ought only to be given occasionally,\u2014is very apt to induce a troublesome diarrhoea (looseness). Do not give your pet too many tit-bits at table; but whatever else you give her, never neglect to let her have her ''two regular meals''.<ref>Gordon Stables,'' 'Cats': their points and characteristics, with Curiosities of cat life, and ...'' 1876 https://books.google.com/books?pg=PA371&id=iUUDAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=0&q=cat%20food%20%22cat%20food%22&f=false</ref>}}\n\nIn the same year, an advertisement for [[Spratt's|Spratt]] (better known for making dog food) said that their cat food entirely superseded \"the unwholesome practice of feeding on boiled horse flesh; keeps the cat in perfect health.\"<ref>ad for Spratt's https://books.google.com/books?id=5-ANAAAAQAAJ&pg=PP8</ref> And, in another book on cats, Stables recommended the company's food:\n\n{{quote|text=Attend to the feeding, and, at a more than one-day show, cats ought to have ''water'' as well as milk. I think boiled [[Lights (offal)|lights]], cut into small pieces, with a very small portion of bullock's liver and bread soaked, is the best food; but I have tried Spratt's Patent Cat Food with a great number of cats, both of my own and those of friends, and have nearly always found it agree; and at a cat show it would, I believe, be both handy and cleanly.<ref>Gordon Stable, ''The domestic cat'', 1876, 61 https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&pg=PA61&id=30oDAAAAQAAJ&num=100&as_brr=1&f=false</ref>}}\n\nSpratt, which began by making dog biscuits, appears to also have been the first commercial producer of cat food.\n\nDuring the 19th century and early 20th centuries, meat for cats and dogs in London, frequently [[horse meat]], was sold from barrows (hand\u2013carts) by itinerant traders known as ''Cats' Meat Men''.<ref name=\":18\">{{cite web | url=http://www.museumoflondonprints.com/image/68598/john-galt-cats-meat-man-c-1901 | title=Cats' Meat Man: c.1901 | publisher=Museum of London | accessdate=October 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n== Natural diet ==\nCats are obligate [[carnivore]]s\u2014meaning, they are true carnivores and depend upon the nutrients present in animal flesh for their dietary needs. Even domesticated cats will relish freshly killed meat from rodents, rabbits, amphibians, birds, reptiles and fish, but cats are also opportunistic feeders and will readily take cooked food<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.timeforpaws.co.uk/blog/wild-cats/|title = Wild Cats Survive - Time for Paws - Time for Paws|website = Time for Paws|language = en-GB|access-date = 2016-03-08}}</ref> as well as dried cat food when offered, if that food is palatable. The natural diet of cats therefore does not include any vegetable matter, although cats have been known to eat certain plants and grasses occasionally, usually as an [[Vomiting|emetic]].\n\nCats cannot synthesize some essential nutrients required for survival, including the amino acids [[taurine]] and [[arginine]], so these nutrients must be sourced from fresh meat in the natural diet. Cats lack the specific physiology to extract nutrients efficiently from plant-based materials, and require a high protein diet, which is why high-energy meats from freshly killed prey are optimal foods.\n\n==Packaging and labeling==\n{{further|Pet food#Labeling and regulation}}\nIn the United States, cat foods labeled as \"complete and balanced\" must meet standards established by the [[Association of American Feed Control Officials]] (AAFCO) either by meeting a nutrient profile or by passing a feeding trial. Cat Food Nutrient Profiles were established in 1992 and updated in 2014 by the AAFCO's Feline Nutrition Expert Subcommittee. The updated profiles replaced the previous recommendations set by the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC). Certain manufacturers label their products with terms such as premium, ultra premium, natural and holistic. Such terms currently have no legal definitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://petfood.aafco.org/Labeling-Labeling-Requirements|title=The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) > Labeling & Labeling Requirements|website=petfood.aafco.org|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref> However, \"While most of the food supplied comes from within the US, the FDA ensures that standards are met within our borders even when components come from countries with less stringent levels of safety or label integrity.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://petfoodtalk.com/catfoodreviews/#cat-food | title = Cat Food Reviews: The Pleasure of Their Company | publisher=petfoodtalk.com}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial cat food diets==\n\nMost store-bought cat food comes in either dry form, also known in the US as ''kibble'', or wet canned form. Some manufacturers sell frozen raw diets and premix products to cater to owners who [[raw feeding|feed raw]].\n\n===Dry food diet===\n[[File:Katzenfutter.JPG|left|thumb|Dry (extruded) cat food example]]\nDry food (8\u201310% moisture) is generally made by [[Food extrusion|extrusion]] cooking under high heat and pressure. Fat may then be sprayed on the food to increase [[palatability]], and other minor ingredients, such as heat-sensitive vitamins, which would be destroyed in the extrusion process, may be added. Dry food is most often packed in multi-wall [[paper bag]]s, sometimes with a [[plastic film]] layer; similar bag styles with film laminates or coextrusions are also used.\n\n===Wet food diet===\n[[File:Canned Cat Food1.jpg|right|thumb|Wet (canned) cat food example (Fish flakes in jelly)]]\nIn much of Europe, the UK and the US, [[canning|canned]] or wet food (75\u201378% moisture) generally comes in aluminum or steel cans in 3 [[ounce|oz]] (85 g), 5.5 oz (156 g), and 13 oz (369 g) sizes. It is also sold in foil pouch form\n\n===Renal diet===\n{{main|Renal diet}}\nA [[renal diet]] is formulated for cats that are living with chronic kidney disease, or CKD.

Weight gain means more energy is being consumed than is being expended in exercise and other functions. A weight management diet is designed to allow fewer calories to be consumed in a larger volume of food, allowing for less risk of an energy imbalance. \n\nAdult cats should be fed a diet that promotes maintaining a healthy weight, while at the same time meeting the individual taste preference of the cat. Cats generally prefer to eat smaller meals more frequently, which can lead to less weight gain compared to cats that are fed free-choice (always available) food. Meanwhile, some cats adapt to free-choice feeding and can maintain normal body weight with no weight gain.<ref name=\":6\" /> In general, indoor cats have less opportunity or need for exercise than outdoor cats; indoor cats are much more prone to weight gain. For indoor cats, there are a variety of choices to promote exercise, including various cat toys designed to stimulate chase and play behaviours.<ref name=\":6\" /> Overall, if an adult cat cannot maintain normal body condition on a free-choice feeding diet, despite exercise levels, portion-controlled feeding is recommended. Many pet cats are fed energy-dense, high carbohydrate diets, which provide much more energy than needed. This is a major issue with indoor cats as it has been shown to lead to obesity. To prevent cats from becoming overweight, owners should be more inclined to implement weight control diets, which provide the cat with nutrient-dense, low energy ingredients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Spofford|first=N|date=2014|title=A moderate fat, low-energy dry expanded diet reduces gain in body condition score when fed as part of a post neutering weight-control regimen in growing pet cats|url=|journal=Journal of Nutritional Science|volume=3|pages=e40|doi=10.1017/jns.2014.48|pmid=26101609|pmc=4473151}}</ref> Studies show that cats fed lower energy diets have significantly reduced incidences of obesity, as the typical indoor pet cat does not need more energy than their resting energy requirement. For an average cat weighing 10-11 pounds (about 5&nbsp;kg), it would have a resting energy requirement of 180-200 kcal/day.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Montes de Oca|first=M|date=2017|title=Prediction equations for metabolizable and digestible energy in feline diets|url=|journal=Animal Feed Science and Technology|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nAlong with energy input and output, specific nutrients can be important in weight control diets. Fiber is an important component that helps control weight, along with various other benefits. A source of soluble and fermentable fiber helps to increase the movement of digesta through the gut and decrease gastric emptying. This helps to increase satiety in cats, potentially decreasing feeding rates and voluntary energy consumption. Fermentable fiber promotes healthy mucosa and [[commensal bacteria]]l growth and improved digestion/nutrient absorption. Prebiotic fibers like [[fructooligosaccharide]]s (FOS) and mannonoligosaccharides (MOS) decrease the number of pathogenic bacteria and increase the number of beneficial bacteria in the gut. They also help to maintain microbial balance and a healthy immune system. Fiber is fermented in the colon to produce short-chain fatty acids which can be used as an energy source. Fermentable fiber has been demonstrated to enhance general health and decrease inflammation.<ref name=\":18\" /> Furthermore, non-fermentable fiber is critical to the formation of well-formed stool, and has been known to increase diet bulk while decreasing caloric density. Insoluble fiber has been proposed to regulate appetite by releasing hormones that reduce hunger. Sources of fiber commonly added in weight management cat food include beet pulp, barley, [[psyllium]] and [[cellulose]].\n\nAnother nutrient important for weight control diets is protein and its component amino acids. Felines, being obligate carnivores, require a natural diet of animal products which consists of protein and fat (i.e. muscle, organs and animal tissue). Dietary protein supplies amino acids that can be utilized and metabolised as energy before using fat stores,  even though protein is not stored in the body the same way as fat.<ref name=\":6\" /> Dietary fat is more efficiently converted to body fat than protein; if an animal is consuming more than its energy requirement and if the excess energy is provided by fat, more weight will be gained than if the excess calories are coming from protein.<ref name=\":6\" /> Dietary protein also improves satiety during feed, resulting in decreased overconsumption of food.<ref name=\":6\" /> The protein content of the diet is a key factor in building and maintaining lean body (muscle) mass, which is an important aspect of weight control. Lean body mass maintenance is regulated by protein intake, but more importantly is regulated by exercise. Limited protein and amino acids in the diet will limit lean body mass growth, but exercise or lack of exercise will allow growth or shrinking of muscle. Successful weight control involves maintenance of healthy adipose tissue levels, but most importantly maintenance of lean body mass. Lean muscle is the driver of basal energy metabolism and aids in the use of energy. When sufficient levels of fat are provided, fat will be used by the body as an energy source, but only when there are insufficient levels of protein.\n\nAn important amino acid that is incorporated many weight loss/weight control diets is [[L-carnitine]]. This is a vitamin-like substance that is found in animal protein. It can be found in ingredients commonly used in more commercial pet foods, but specifically weight management/weight loss diets. L-carnitine is involved in many biological pathways, more specifically fatty acid metabolism, allowing for the conversion of long-chain fatty acids into energy. The introduction of L-carnitine ensures rapid transport and oxidation of fatty acids as well as efficient usage of dietary fatty acids and protein. Supplementary L-carnitine is used more often in weight loss diets, since its benefits mainly involve fatty acid metabolism to control weight loss. However, since weight control is, in essence, a prevention stage in overall weight management, it still has value in weight control diets in preserving and building lean body mass and inhibiting the storage of excess dietary fat. The majority of studies focusing on supplementary L-carnitine use look at its benefits for weight loss, including its effect on metabolic rate and fatty acid oxidation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Center|first=SA|date=2012|title=Influence of dietary supplementation with (L)-carnitine on metabolic rate, fatty acid oxidation, body condition and weight loss in overweight cats|url=|journal=Cornell University: Department of Clinical Sciences, College of Veterinary Medicine|volume=73|issue=7|pages=1012\u20131015|pmid=22738052|doi=10.2460/ajvr.73.7.1002}}</ref> At the same time, these studies still show similar results that prove their{{clarify|date=December 2017}} effects of controlling fatty acid metabolism for weight control, to avoid the need for weight loss diets.\n\n===Grain-free diet===\nGrain free cat food substitutes the typical carbohydrate sources like wheat, corn or rice with alternative sources such as white potato, peas, sweet potato or tapioca. \n\nA study published in the Journal of Feline Medicine and Surgery in 2018 compared the carbohydrate content between grain-free diets and diets containing grains.

It was found that the grain free diets had a lower mean carbohydrate content than the diets containing grain; however, there was a very wide range and lots of overlap between the two groups in both their carbohydrate contents. Sone grain free diets even had a higher amount of carbohydrates than the diets containing grain. Calorie amounts were similar for both diets. <ref name=\":7\" />\n\nA recent study published by the FDA has potentially linked grain free diets to [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] in both dogs and cats.

Biosynthesis of niacin occurs by metabolism of tryptophan via the kynurenine pathway to quinolinic acid, the niacin precursor. However, cats have a high activity of picolinic acid carboxylase, which converts one of the intermediates to picolinic acid instead of quinolinic acid. As a result, niacin can become deficient and require supplementation.\n\n===Arginine===\n{{see|urea cycle}}\nCats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal. Arginine is an essential additive in cat food because cats have low levels of the enzymes which are responsible for the synthesis of [[ornithine]] and [[citrulline]] in the small intestine (specifically, for [[pyrroline-5-carboxylate]] production).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rogers | first1 = QR | last2 = Phang | first2 = JM | year = 1985 | title = Deficiency of pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase in the intestinal mucosa of the cat | url = | journal = J Nutr | volume = 115 | issue = 1| pages = 146\u201350 | doi = 10.1093/jn/115.1.146 }}</ref> Citrulline would typically go on to the kidneys to make arginine, but because cats have a deficiency in the enzymes that make it, citrulline is not produced in adequate quantities to make arginine. Arginine is essential in the urea cycle in order to convert the toxic component ammonia into urea that can then be excreted in the urine. Because of its essential role, deficiency in arginine results in a buildup of toxic ammonia and leads to [[hyperammonemia]]. The symptoms of hyperammonemia include lethargy, vomiting, ataxia, and hyperesthesia, and can be serious enough to induce death and coma in a matter of days if a cat is being fed an arginine-free diet. The quick onset of these symptoms is due to the fact that diets devoid in arginine will typically still contain all of the other amino acids, which will continue to be catabolized by the body, producing mass amounts of ammonia that very quickly build up with no way of being excreted.\n\n=== Zinc ===\nZinc's connection to skin and coat health is due to its influence on regulating cellular

Overall, several major companies recalled more than 100 brands of pet foods with most of the recalled product coming from Menu Foods. The most likely cause according to the FDA is the presence of [[melamine]] in the wheat gluten of the affected foods. Melamine is known to falsely inflate the protein content rating of substances in laboratory tests. The economic impact on the pet food market has been extensive, with Menu Foods alone losing roughly $30 million from the recall.

On the surface of the [[Earth]], wind consists of the bulk movement of air. In [[outer space]], [[solar wind]] is the movement of gases or charged particles from the [[Sun]] through space, while [[planetary wind]] is the [[outgassing]] of light [[chemical element]]s from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their [[scale (spatial)|spatial scale]], their [[speed]], the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the [[Solar System]] occur on [[Neptune]] and [[Saturn]]. Winds have various aspects: [[velocity]] ([[wind speed]]); the density of the gas involved; energy content or [[wind energy]]. Wind is also an important means of transportation for seeds and small birds; with time things can travel thousands of miles in the wind.\n\nIn [[meteorology]], winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high-speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed [[squall]]s. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as breeze, [[gale]], [[Storm#Classification|storm]], and [[hurricane]]. Wind occurs on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of [[solar energy]] between the [[climate zone]]s on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale [[atmospheric circulation]] are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet ([[Coriolis effect]]). Within the tropics, [[thermal low]] circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive [[monsoon]] circulations. In coastal areas the [[sea breeze]]/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.\n\nIn human civilization, the concept of wind has been explored in [[mythology]], influenced the events of history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a [[wind power|power source]] for mechanical work, electricity, and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of [[sailing ship]]s across Earth's oceans. [[Hot air balloon]]s use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of [[wind shear]] caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and human-made structures are damaged or destroyed.\n\nWinds can shape landforms, via a variety of [[aeolian processes]] such as the formation of fertile soils, such as [[loess]], and by [[erosion]]. Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the [[prevailing winds]]; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.\n\n== Causes ==\n{{See also|Atmospheric pressure}}\n[[File:10 PM March 12 surface analysis of Great Blizzard of 1888.png|thumb|right|[[surface weather analysis|Surface analysis]] of the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]]. Areas with greater isobaric packing indicate higher winds.]]\n\nWind is caused by differences in the [[atmospheric pressure]]. When a [[pressure gradient force|difference in atmospheric pressure]] exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the [[Coriolis effect]], except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the [[atmospheric circulation]]) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of [[solar energy]] leading to [[buoyancy force]]s) and the [[Coriolis effect|rotation of the planet]]. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach [[geostrophic balance]]. Near the Earth's surface, [[friction]] causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.<ref>{{cite web|author = JetStream|title = Origin of Wind|publisher = [[National Weather Service]] Southern Region Headquarters|year= 2008|accessdate=2009-02-16 |url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream//synoptic/wind.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Makarieva|first=Anastassia|author2=V.

The kinetic energy of a packet of air of mass ''m'' with velocity ''v'' is given by ''\u00bd m v<sup>2</sup>''. To find the mass of the packet passing through an area ''A'' perpendicular its velocity (which could be the rotor area of a turbine), we multiply its volume after time ''t'' has passed with the [[air density]] ''\u03c1'', which gives us ''m'' = ''A'' ''v'' ''t'' ''\u03c1''. So, we find that the total wind energy is:\n\n:<math>E = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A v^3 t</math>\n\n[[Derivative|Differentiating]] with respect to time to find the rate of increase of energy, we find that the total wind [[Power (physics)|power]] is:\n\n:<math>P = dE/dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A v^3</math>\n\nWind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind velocity.\n\n=== Theoretical power captured by a wind turbine ===\nTotal wind power could be captured only if the wind velocity is reduced to zero. In a realistic wind turbine, this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave the turbine. A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered. Using the concept of [[stream tube]], the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is {{sfrac|16|27}} \u2248 59% of the total theoretical wind power<ref>[http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/library/digitalcommons/assets/pacp_7.pdf The Physics of Wind Turbines]. Kira Grogg Carleton College (2005) p. 8. (PDF). Retrieved 2011-11-03.</ref> (see: [[Betz' law]]).\n\n=== Practical wind turbine power ===\nFurther insufficiencies, such as rotor blade [[friction]] and [[drag (physics)|drag]], gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine. The basic relation that the turbine power is (approximately) proportional to the third power of velocity remains.\n\n== Global climatology ==\n{{Main|Prevailing winds}}\n[[File:Map prevailing winds on earth.png|right|thumb|The westerlies and trade winds]]\n[[File:Earth Global Circulation.jpg|right|thumb|Winds are part of Earth's atmospheric circulation]]\nEasterly winds, on average, dominate the flow pattern across the poles, westerly winds blow across the [[mid-latitudes]] of the earth, polewards of the [[subtropical ridge]], while easterlies again dominate the [[tropics]].\n\nDirectly under the subtropical ridge are the doldrums, or horse latitudes, where winds are lighter.

The sea is warmed by the sun more slowly because of water's greater [[specific heat]] compared to land.<ref>{{cite web|author= Steve Ackerman|year=1995|url=http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/wxwise/seabrz.html|title=Sea and Land Breezes|publisher=University of Wisconsin|accessdate=2006-10-24}}</ref> As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it by conduction. The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2&nbsp;millibars from the ocean to the land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher [[sea level pressure]], flows inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an offshore wind of {{convert|sp=us|8|kn|km/h}} exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.\n\nAt night, the land cools off more quickly than the ocean because of differences in their [[specific heat]] values.

In gliding, wind gradients just above the surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a [[Glider aircraft|glider]]. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on [[ground launch]]es, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the gradient.<ref>{{cite book|title=Glider Flying Handbook|year=2003|publisher=U.S. Federal Aviation Administration|location=U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.|id=FAA-8083-13_GFH|pages=7\u201316|url=http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/glider_handbook/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218083721/http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/glider_handbook/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2005-12-18|accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong.

Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for a large percentage of the biomass of land plants.\n\n=== Erosion ===\n[[File:Im Salar de Uyuni.jpg|thumb|right|A rock formation in the [[Altiplano]], [[Bolivia]], sculpted by wind erosion]]\nErosion can be the result of material movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation.

An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for [[germination]]. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=M.

Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include [[tumbleweed]]s. A related process to anemochory is [[anemophily]], which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind.

The movement of air causes movements of parts of natural objects, such as leaves or grass. These objects will produce sound if they touch each other. Even a soft wind will cause a low level of [[environmental noise]]. If the wind is blowing harder, it may produce howling sounds of varying frequencies. This may be caused by the wind blowing over cavities, or by vortices created in the air downstream of an object.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/how-does-wind-produce-sounds.118880/|title=How does wind produce sounds?|author=|date=|website=physicsforums.com}}</ref> Especially on high buildings, many structural parts may be a cause of annoying noise at certain wind conditions.

On the surface of the [[Earth]], wind consists of the bulk movement of air. In [[outer space]], [[solar wind]] is the movement of gases or charged particles from the [[Sun]] through space, while [[planetary wind]] is the [[outgassing]] of light [[chemical element]]s from a planet's atmosphere into space. Winds are commonly classified by their [[scale (spatial)|spatial scale]], their [[speed]], the types of forces that cause them, the regions in which they occur, and their effect. The strongest observed winds on a planet in the [[Solar System]] occur on [[Neptune]] and [[Saturn]]. Winds have various aspects: [[velocity]] ([[wind speed]]); the density of the gas involved; energy content or [[wind energy]]. Wind is also an important means of transportation for seeds and small birds; with time things can travel thousands of miles in the wind.\n\nIn [[meteorology]], winds are often referred to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high-speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed [[squall]]s. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as breeze, [[gale]], [[Storm#Classification|storm]], and [[hurricane]]. Wind occurs on a range of scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of [[solar energy]] between the [[climate zone]]s on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale [[atmospheric circulation]] are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and the rotation of the planet ([[Coriolis effect]]). Within the tropics, [[thermal low]] circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive [[monsoon]] circulations. In coastal areas the [[sea breeze]]/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.\n\nIn human civilization, the concept of wind has been explored in [[mythology]], influenced the events of history, expanded the range of transport and warfare, and provided a [[wind power|power source]] for mechanical work, electricity, and recreation. Wind powers the voyages of [[sailing ship]]s across Earth's oceans. [[Hot air balloon]]s use the wind to take short trips, and powered flight uses it to increase lift and reduce fuel consumption. Areas of [[wind shear]] caused by various weather phenomena can lead to dangerous situations for aircraft. When winds become strong, trees and human-made structures are damaged or destroyed.\n\nWinds can shape landforms, via a variety of [[aeolian processes]] such as the formation of fertile soils, such as [[loess]], and by [[erosion]]. Dust from large deserts can be moved great distances from its source region by the [[prevailing winds]]; winds that are accelerated by rough topography and associated with dust outbreaks have been assigned regional names in various parts of the world because of their significant effects on those regions. Wind also affects the spread of wildfires. Winds can disperse seeds from various plants, enabling the survival and dispersal of those plant species, as well as flying insect populations. When combined with cold temperatures, wind has a negative impact on livestock. Wind affects animals' food stores, as well as their hunting and defensive strategies.\n\n== Causes ==\n{{See also|Atmospheric pressure}}\n[[File:10 PM March 12 surface analysis of Great Blizzard of 1888.png|thumb|right|[[surface weather analysis|Surface analysis]] of the [[Great Blizzard of 1888]]. Areas with greater isobaric packing indicate higher winds.]]\n\nWind is caused by differences in the [[atmospheric pressure]]. When a [[pressure gradient force|difference in atmospheric pressure]] exists, air moves from the higher to the lower pressure area, resulting in winds of various speeds. On a rotating planet, air will also be deflected by the [[Coriolis effect]], except exactly on the equator. Globally, the two major driving factors of large-scale wind patterns (the [[atmospheric circulation]]) are the differential heating between the equator and the poles (difference in absorption of [[solar energy]] leading to [[buoyancy force]]s) and the [[Coriolis effect|rotation of the planet]]. Outside the tropics and aloft from frictional effects of the surface, the large-scale winds tend to approach [[geostrophic balance]]. Near the Earth's surface, [[friction]] causes the wind to be slower than it would be otherwise. Surface friction also causes winds to blow more inward into low-pressure areas.<ref>{{cite web|author = JetStream|title = Origin of Wind|publisher = [[National Weather Service]] Southern Region Headquarters|year= 2008|accessdate=2009-02-16 |url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream//synoptic/wind.htm}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Makarieva|first=Anastassia|author2=V.

The kinetic energy of a packet of air of mass ''m'' with velocity ''v'' is given by ''\u00bd m v<sup>2</sup>''. To find the mass of the packet passing through an area ''A'' perpendicular its velocity (which could be the rotor area of a turbine), we multiply its volume after time ''t'' has passed with the [[air density]] ''\u03c1'', which gives us ''m'' = ''A'' ''v'' ''t'' ''\u03c1''. So, we find that the total wind energy is:\n\n:<math>E = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A v^3 t</math>\n\n[[Derivative|Differentiating]] with respect to time to find the rate of increase of energy, we find that the total wind [[Power (physics)|power]] is:\n\n:<math>P = dE/dt = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho A v^3</math>\n\nWind power is thus proportional to the third power of the wind velocity.\n\n=== Theoretical power captured by a wind turbine ===\nTotal wind power could be captured only if the wind velocity is reduced to zero. In a realistic wind turbine, this is impossible, as the captured air must also leave the turbine. A relation between the input and output wind velocity must be considered. Using the concept of [[stream tube]], the maximal achievable extraction of wind power by a wind turbine is {{sfrac|16|27}} \u2248 59% of the total theoretical wind power<ref>[http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/library/digitalcommons/assets/pacp_7.pdf The Physics of Wind Turbines].

The warm air is less dense than the surrounding environment and so it rises. This causes a pressure gradient of about 2&nbsp;millibars from the ocean to the land. The cooler air above the sea, now with higher [[sea level pressure]], flows inland into the lower pressure, creating a cooler breeze near the coast. When large-scale winds are calm, the strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land mass and the sea. If an offshore wind of {{convert|sp=us|8|kn|km/h}} exists, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.\n\nAt night, the land cools off more quickly than the ocean because of differences in their [[specific heat]] values.

Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on [[ground launch]]es, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed to deal with the effect of the gradient.<ref>{{cite book|title=Glider Flying Handbook|year=2003|publisher=U.S. Federal Aviation Administration|location=U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.|id=FAA-8083-13_GFH|pages=7\u201316|url=http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/glider_handbook/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051218083721/http://www.faa.gov/library/manuals/aircraft/glider_handbook/|url-status=dead|archive-date=2005-12-18|accessdate=2009-06-17}}</ref> When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.<ref name=Piggott>{{cite book|author=Derek Piggott|title=Gliding: a Handbook on Soaring Flight|publisher=Knauff & Grove|year=1997|isbn=978-0-9605676-4-5|pages=85\u201386, 130\u2013132}}</ref>\n\n== Role in the natural world ==\n{{See also|Aeolian processes}}\nIn arid climates, the main source of erosion is wind.<ref name=\"Erosion\">{{cite web|author1=Vern Hofman  |author2=Dave Franzen |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1997|url=http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/disaster/drought/emergencytillagetocontrolerosion.html|title=Emergency Tillage to Control Wind Erosion|publisher=[[North Dakota State University]] Extension Service|accessdate=2009-03-21}}</ref> The general wind circulation moves small particulates such as dust across wide oceans thousands of kilometers downwind of their point of origin,<ref name=\"Gobi\">{{cite journal|author=James K.

Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for a large percentage of the biomass of land plants.\n\n=== Erosion ===\n[[File:Im Salar de Uyuni.jpg|thumb|right|A rock formation in the [[Altiplano]], [[Bolivia]], sculpted by wind erosion]]\nErosion can be the result of material movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing erosion by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind erosion generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand [[dunes]], on a beach or in a desert.<ref>{{cite web|author=[[United States Geological Survey]]|year=2004|url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/dunes/index.html|title=Dunes&nbsp;\u2013 Getting Started|accessdate=2009-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726013120/http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/coast/dunes/index.html|archive-date=2009-07-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, [[friable]], slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, [[silt]]y, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) [[sediment]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=F. von Richthofen|year=1882|title=On the mode of origin of the loess|journal=Geological Magazine (Decade II)|doi=10.1017/S001675680017164X |volume= 9|issue=7|pages=293\u2013305|bibcode=1882GeoM....9..293R|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1880729/files/article.pdf}}</ref> It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick.

An important constraint on wind dispersal is the need for abundant seed production to maximize the likelihood of a seed landing in a site suitable for [[germination]]. There are also strong evolutionary constraints on this dispersal mechanism. For instance, species in the Asteraceae on islands tended to have reduced dispersal capabilities (i.e., larger seed mass and smaller pappus) relative to the same species on the mainland.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=M.

Unusual mechanisms of wind dispersal include [[tumbleweed]]s. A related process to anemochory is [[anemophily]], which is the process where pollen is distributed by wind.

The radio interferometer continued to expanded with larger and better [[radio telescope]]s. In 1979, the two dishes were retired from the radio interferometer and were repurposed to be used as an array dedicated to solar observation. The Owens Valley Solar Array was established with the two dish interferometer under the direction of professor [[Harold Zirin]] who also directed the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO).

Eventually, the university decided to change the focus of the department and look for another organization to take over the BBSO instead. By the spring of 1996, Caltech announced that [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (NJIT) would run the BBSO. The agreement was signed in early 1997 to have NJIT lease the BBSO land and buildings from Caltech until 2048. The instruments and grants of the BBSO, worth about $1.6 million a year at that time, would be transferred to NJIT on 1 July 1997.<ref>{{cite news |title=Solar Observatory Goes Coast to Coast |url=https://www.sciencemag.org/news/1997/03/solar-observatory-goes-coast-coast |accessdate=1 January 2019 |work=Science |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |date=5 March 1997}}</ref>\n\nAt that time, Dale Gary who was a research associate in Astrophysics at Caltech<ref name=\"Geisel\"/> and a [[principal investigator]] at the Owens Valley Solar Array lab, moved to NJIT to become a faculty.<ref name=\"Zirin\"/> The management of the Owens Valley Solar Array was then transferred to NJIT in 1997.

The radio interferometer continued to expanded with larger and better [[radio telescope]]s.

The Owens Valley Solar Array was established with the two dish interferometer under the direction of professor [[Harold Zirin]] who also directed the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO).

Eventually, the university decided to change the focus of the department and look for another organization to take over the BBSO instead. By the spring of 1996, Caltech announced that [[New Jersey Institute of Technology]] (NJIT) would run the BBSO. The agreement was signed in early 1997 to have NJIT lease the BBSO land and buildings from Caltech until 2048.

This would bring the array to have the total of 15 antennas with 13 smaller antennas in a three-arm spiral configuration that span across the {{convert|900|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} radius (see layout on the right). This would required all existing smaller antennas to be relocated and thirteen new antenna pads to installed. A new control building would be erected and cable trenching would be done along the access roads.

While it is referred to as a \"palace\" because of its intended use as the retirement residence of Diocletian, the term can be misleading as the structure is massive and more resembles a large fortress: about half of it was for Diocletian's personal use, and the rest housed the military garrison.\n\nThe complex was built on a peninsula six kilometers southwest from [[Salona]], the capital of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)]], one of the [[Demography of the Roman Empire#Urbanization|largest cities of the late empire]] with 60,000 people and the birthplace of Diocletian. The terrain around Salona slopes gently seaward and is typical [[karst]], consisting of low [[limestone]] ridges running east to west with [[marl]] in the clefts between them. Today the remains of the palace are part of the historic core of Split, which in 1979 was listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[Diocletian]] had ordered the construction of the heavily fortified compound near his hometown of [[Spalatum]] in preparation for his retirement on 1 May 305 AD.<ref>Fik Meijer (2004) ''Emperors Don't Die in Bed''  p. 114</ref>. The site chosen was near [[Salona]], the provincial administrative center of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], on the southern side of a short peninsula,  On the basis of Roman map data (known through the medieval parchment ''Tabula Peutingeriana''), there was already a Spalatum settlement in that bay, the remains and size of which have not yet been established. \n\n[[Image:Diocletian's Palace (original appearance).jpg|thumb|left|Reconstruction of Diocletian's Palace in its original appearance upon completion in AD 305 (viewed from the south-west)]]\nThe beginning of the construction of Diocletian's palace has not exactly been established. It is assumed to have begun around 295, after the introduction of the [[Tetrarchy]] (the rule of four). Yet ten years after that decision, when Diocletian abdicated in 305, the palace seems to have still been unfinished, and there are indications that some works were taking place while the emperor was residing at the Palace. It is unknown under whose architectural ideas the palace was built and who its builders were. The complex was modeled on [[Roman forts]] of the 3rd-century era, examples of which can be seen across the Limes, such as the bridgehead fort [[Divitia]] across the [[Rhine]] from [[Cologne]].<ref>Dixon, Karen R. and Southern, Pat. ''The Late Roman Army'' p. 34</ref> \n\nHowever, the engraved Greek names Zotikos and Filotas, as well as many Greek characters, indicate that a number of builders were originally from the eastern part of the empire, i.e. Diocletian brought with him masters from the East. Still, it is highly likely that a large part of the workforce was of local origin. The basic materials came from close proximity. The white limestone comes from [[Bra\u010d]] and some of Seget near [[Trogir]]; [[tufa]] was extracted from nearby riverbeds and bricks were made in [[Spalatum]] and other workshops located nearby. The building as a whole did not have an immediate role in Roman construction in the past. Its source comes from the basic function and position adjustment.\n\nAt [[Carnuntum]], people begged Diocletian to return to the throne in order to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]'s rise to power and Maxentius' usurpation.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31\u201332; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90.</ref> Diocletian \nfamously replied:\n{{quote|If you could show the [[cabbage]] that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed.<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 39.6.</ref>}}\nThis was a reference to the Emperor retiring to his palace to grow cabbages.\n\nDiocletian lived on for four more years, spending his days in his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, and his ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. In his palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed [[suicide]]. He died on 3 December 312.<ref name=\"DEATH\" /><ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41.</ref>{{refn|The range of dates proposed for Diocletian's death have stretched from 311 through to 318. Until recently, the date of 3 December 311 has been favoured; however, the absence of Diocletian on Maxentius' \"''AETERNA MEMORIA''\" coins would indicate that he was alive through to Maxentius' defeat in October 312. Given that Diocletian had died by the time of [[Maximinus II|Maximian Daia]]'s death in July 313, it has been argued that the correct date of his death was 3 December 312.<ref name=\"DEATH\" />|group=\"Note\"}}\n\nWith the death of Diocletian, the life of the palace did not end, and it remained an imperial possession of the Roman court, providing shelter to the expelled members of the Emperor's family. In 480, Emperor [[Julius Nepos]] was murdered by one of his own soldiers, reportedly stabbed to death in his villa near Salona.<ref>{{ill|Wilhelm Ensslin|de|Wilhelm En\u00dflin}}, \"Julius Nepos\", in ''Paulys Realencyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft'', Band XVI,2 (1935), S. 1505\u20131510.</ref> Since Diocletian's palace was in the area, it might have been the same building. \n\nIts second life came when [[Salona]] was largely destroyed in the invasions of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]] in the 7th century, though the exact year of the destruction still remains an open debate between archaeologists. Part of the expelled population, now refugees, found shelter inside the palace's strong walls and with them a new, organized city life began.<ref>Charles George Herbermann, ''The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference'' (1913).

Today many restaurants and shops, and some homes can still be found within the walls.\n\nIn the period of the free medieval commune, between the 12th and 14th centuries, there was a greater architectural development, when many medieval houses filled not only Roman buildings but also a large part of the free space of streets and docks. Also completed in this period was the construction of the Romanesque bell tower of the [[Cathedral of Saint Domnius]], which inhabits the building that was originally erected as Jupiter's temple and then used as the Mausoleum of Diocletian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apollo-magazine.com/how-life-goes-on-in-a-ruined-roman-palace/|title=How life goes on in a ruined Roman palace|date=2016-12-22|website=Apollo Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Middle Ages]], the palace was virtually unknown in the rest of Europe, until the Scottish architect [[Robert Adam]] had the ruins surveyed. Then, with the aid of French artist and antiquary [[Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau]] and several draughtsmen, Adam published ''Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro in Dalmatia'' (London, 1764).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/RuinspalaceEmpe00Adam Text] at Archive.org; [http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/ruinspalaceempe00adam Text] at the Smithsonian Institution; [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?id=DLDecArts.AdamRuins Text] at University of Wisconsin</ref>\n\nDiocletian's palace was an inspiration for Adam's new style of [[Neoclassical architecture]]<ref name=\"CMHogan\">Hogan, C.

Diocletian's Palace far transcends local importance because of its degree of preservation. The Palace is one of the most famous and complete architectural and cultural features on the Croatian [[Adriatic]] coast. As the world's most complete remains of a Roman palace, it holds an outstanding place in Mediterranean, European, and world heritage.\n\n==Cultural heritage==\n[[File:Peristyle of Diocletian's Palace in Split, Robert Adam, 1764 (cropped).jpg|thumb|View of the Peristyle in 1764, engraving by [[Robert Adam]]. The Peristyle is the central square of the palace, where the main entrance to Diocletian's quarters (pictured) is located.]]\n\nIn November 1979 [[UNESCO]], in line with the international convention on cultural and natural heritage, adopted a proposal that the historic city of Split built around the Palace should be included in the register of [[World Cultural Heritage]].<ref>[http://w3.mrki.info/split/diokl.html Diocletian Palace]</ref>\n\nIn November 2006 the City Council decided to permit over twenty new buildings within the palace (including a shopping and garage complex), although the palace had been declared a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Monument. It is said that this decision was politically motivated and largely due to lobbying by local property developers. Once the public in 2007 became aware of the project, they petitioned against the decision and won. No new buildings, shopping center or the underground garage were built.\n\nThe [[World Monuments Fund]] has been working on a conservation project at the palace, including surveying structural integrity and cleaning and restoring the stone and plasterwork.\n\nThe palace is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Croatian 500 [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] banknote, issued in 1993.<ref>[http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/enovcan.htm?tsfsg=5caabbb4dca58151e125c650d3cdae36 Features of Kuna Banknotes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506012028/http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/enovcan.htm?tsfsg=5caabbb4dca58151e125c650d3cdae36 |date=6 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/novcanice/e500k.htm?tsfsg=a649438eb16231e47533d70f5e0ed4c4 500 kuna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014206/http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/novcanice/e500k.htm?tsfsg=a649438eb16231e47533d70f5e0ed4c4 |date=4 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Tafel 001a Spalato - Grundriss vom Kaiserpalast - Robert Adam 1764 -.jpg|thumb| Floor plan of Diocletian's palace]]\nThe ground plan of the palace is an irregular rectangle measuring east: 214.97 m, north: 174.74 m, south: 181.65 m (adjusting for the terrain), with sixteen towers projecting from the western, northern, and eastern facades on the facades facing the mainland and four towers on the corners of the square are ground floor gives the palace a characteristic of the [[Roman fortifications|legionary forts]] similar to those on the [[Danube]].<ref>Dixon, Karen R. and Southern, Pat. The Late Roman Army p. 143</ref> \n\nTwo of the six octagonal ground-floor towers were framed by three landing entrances, the six rectangular ground floors of the rectangular floor being between the corner and the octagonal. To date, three corner corners (except southwestern) have been preserved, and only the remains of octagonal and rectangular ones. Three well-preserved landings have been architecturally fragmented, especially the northern one, which was the main approach from [[Salona]]. The south, [[Bronze Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|seaside gate]], small, simple and well preserved. The facade walls of the palace in their lower parts are massive and simple without openings, and in the upper part they are exposed to large arches that are simple to the land, ie on the west, north and east facades. [[Cellars of Diocletian's Palace|Subterranean portions]] of the palace feature [[barrel vault]]ed stonework.\n\n===Outer walls===\nOnly the southern facade, which rose directly from or very near to the sea, was unfortified. The elaborate architectural composition of the arcaded gallery on its upper floor differs from the more severe treatment of the three shore facades. A monumental gate in the middle of each of these walls led to an enclosed courtyard.

From there, one approached the Emperor's apartment, which stretched 40 m deep along the entire south facade; it is only partly preserved in the upper floor, but its ground-floor, translated substructures that directly bore it are almost completely preserved, so the overall layout and appearance of the upper spaces can be seen given the coincidence of the upper and lower floor plans. On the west side of the upper floor are preserved the remains of a dome hall and two halls with apses, and on the east side are parts of an octagonal dining room ([[triclinium]]) with three halls with a cross floor plan. The wall of the Western Cross Hall is preserved in full height. Diocletian's apartment was interconnected by a long room along the southern fa\u00e7ade (cryptoporticus)<ref> https://visitsplit.com/en/525/vestibule</ref> from which through 42 windows and 3 balconies a view of the sea was opened. Two baths were recently found north of the Emperor's apartment, one adjacent to the west and the other to the eastern halls. Although for many centuries almost completely filled with refuse, most of the substructure is well preserved and indicates the original shape and disposition of the rooms above.\n\n====The Vestibule====\n{{Main|Vestibule (Split)}}\nA rotonda, that was once the first section of the imperial corridor in the Palace that led via [[Peristyle|the Peristyle]] to the Imperial apartments<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia/split/attractions/vestibule/a/poi-sig/1544002/358789</ref> of the Palace. \n\n====The Palace Cellars====\n{{Main|Cellars of Diocletian's Palace}}\n[[File:Split D81 3055 (38620797821).jpg|thumb|Cellars of Diocletian's Palace]]\nSet below what were the Imperial apartments, the Cellars of Diocletian Palace are a set of substructures, located at the southern end of the Palace,<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.absolute-croatia.com/split-region-dalmatia/split/attractions/item/diocletians-palace-basements-split|title=Diocletian's palace basement, Split|website=www.absolute-croatia.com}}</ref> that represent one of the best preserved ancient complexes of their kind in the world.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://visitsplit.com/en/529/the-substructures|title=Split - The Substructures|website=visitsplit.com}}</ref>\n\n====Peristyle====\nA monumental court, called the [[Peristyle]], formed the Northern access to the imperial apartments in front of the Vestibule. It also gave access to Diocletian's mausoleum on the East (today the [[Cathedral of Saint Domnius]]), and to three temples on the West (two of which are now lost, with the third, originally being the [[Temple of Jupiter, Split|temple of Jupiter]], becoming a baptistery). There is also a temple just to the west of the Peristylum called The Temple of [[Aesculapius]], which has a semi-cylindrical roof built of stone blocks, which did not leak until the 1940s when it was covered with a lead roof. The temple was recently restored.\n\n====Northern half====\nThe northern half of the palace, divided into two parts by the main north-south street (''[[cardo]]'') leading from the [[Golden Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|Golden Gate]] (''Porta aurea'') to the Peristyle, is less well preserved. It is usually supposed that each part was a residential complex, housing soldiers, servants, and possibly some other facilities.\n\n====Streets and annex buildings====\nBoth parts of the palace were apparently surrounded by streets,<ref>http://w3.mrki.info/split/diokl.html</ref> leading to the perimeter walls through a rectangular buildings (possibly storage magazines).{{dubious|According to floor-plan, it's rather ALONGSIDE.|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Building materials===\n[[File:SPLIT-Sphinx peristyle.jpg|thumb|Sphinx at the Peristyle]]\nThe Palace is built of white local [[limestone]] and [[marble]] of high quality, most of which was from the Bra\u010d marble quarries on the island of [[Bra\u010d]], of [[tuff]] taken from the nearby river beds, and of brick made in [[Salona|Salonitan]] and other factories. Some material for decoration was imported: [[Egypt]]ian [[granite]] [[column]]s, fine marble for revetments and some capitals produced in workshops in the [[Proconnesos]].\n\n===Egyptian sphinxes===\nThe Palace was decorated with numerous 3500-year-old granite [[sphinx]]es, originating from the site{{dubious|What site?

While it is referred to as a \"palace\" because of its intended use as the retirement residence of Diocletian, the term can be misleading as the structure is massive and more resembles a large fortress: about half of it was for Diocletian's personal use, and the rest housed the military garrison.\n\nThe complex was built on a peninsula six kilometers southwest from [[Salona]], the capital of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)]], one of the [[Demography of the Roman Empire#Urbanization|largest cities of the late empire]] with 60,000 people and the birthplace of Diocletian. The terrain around Salona slopes gently seaward and is typical [[karst]], consisting of low [[limestone]] ridges running east to west with [[marl]] in the clefts between them. Today the remains of the palace are part of the historic core of Split, which in 1979 was listed by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]].\n\n==History==\n\n[[Diocletian]] had ordered the construction of the heavily fortified compound near his hometown of [[Spalatum]] in preparation for his retirement on 1 May 305 AD.<ref>Fik Meijer (2004) ''Emperors Don't Die in Bed''  p. 114</ref>. The site chosen was near [[Salona]], the provincial administrative center of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], on the southern side of a short peninsula,  On the basis of Roman map data (known through the medieval parchment ''Tabula Peutingeriana''), there was already a Spalatum settlement in that bay, the remains and size of which have not yet been established. \n\n[[Image:Diocletian's Palace (original appearance).jpg|thumb|left|Reconstruction of Diocletian's Palace in its original appearance upon completion in AD 305 (viewed from the south-west)]]\nThe beginning of the construction of Diocletian's palace has not exactly been established. It is assumed to have begun around 295, after the introduction of the [[Tetrarchy]] (the rule of four). Yet ten years after that decision, when Diocletian abdicated in 305, the palace seems to have still been unfinished, and there are indications that some works were taking place while the emperor was residing at the Palace. It is unknown under whose architectural ideas the palace was built and who its builders were. The complex was modeled on [[Roman forts]] of the 3rd-century era, examples of which can be seen across the Limes, such as the bridgehead fort [[Divitia]] across the [[Rhine]] from [[Cologne]].<ref>Dixon, Karen R. and Southern, Pat. ''The Late Roman Army'' p. 34</ref> \n\nHowever, the engraved Greek names Zotikos and Filotas, as well as many Greek characters, indicate that a number of builders were originally from the eastern part of the empire, i.e. Diocletian brought with him masters from the East. Still, it is highly likely that a large part of the workforce was of local origin. The basic materials came from close proximity. The white limestone comes from [[Bra\u010d]] and some of Seget near [[Trogir]]; [[tufa]] was extracted from nearby riverbeds and bricks were made in [[Spalatum]] and other workshops located nearby. The building as a whole did not have an immediate role in Roman construction in the past. Its source comes from the basic function and position adjustment.\n\nAt [[Carnuntum]], people begged Diocletian to return to the throne in order to resolve the conflicts that had arisen through [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]'s rise to power and Maxentius' usurpation.<ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 31\u201332; Lenski, 65; Odahl, 90.</ref> Diocletian \nfamously replied:\n{{quote|If you could show the [[cabbage]] that I planted with my own hands to your emperor, he definitely wouldn't dare suggest that I replace the peace and happiness of this place with the storms of a never-satisfied greed.<ref>Aurelius Victor, ''Epitome de Caesaribus'' 39.6.</ref>}}\nThis was a reference to the Emperor retiring to his palace to grow cabbages.\n\nDiocletian lived on for four more years, spending his days in his palace gardens. He saw his tetrarchic system fail, torn by the selfish ambitions of his successors. He heard of Maximian's third claim to the throne, his forced suicide, and his ''[[damnatio memoriae]]''. In his palace, statues and portraits of his former companion emperor were torn down and destroyed. Deep in despair and illness, Diocletian may have committed [[suicide]]. He died on 3 December 312.<ref name=\"DEATH\" /><ref>Barnes, ''Constantine and Eusebius'', 41.</ref>{{refn|The range of dates proposed for Diocletian's death have stretched from 311 through to 318. Until recently, the date of 3 December 311 has been favoured; however, the absence of Diocletian on Maxentius' \"''AETERNA MEMORIA''\" coins would indicate that he was alive through to Maxentius' defeat in October 312. Given that Diocletian had died by the time of [[Maximinus II|Maximian Daia]]'s death in July 313, it has been argued that the correct date of his death was 3 December 312.<ref name=\"DEATH\" />|group=\"Note\"}}\n\nWith the death of Diocletian, the life of the palace did not end, and it remained an imperial possession of the Roman court, providing shelter to the expelled members of the Emperor's family. In 480, Emperor [[Julius Nepos]] was murdered by one of his own soldiers, reportedly stabbed to death in his villa near Salona.<ref>{{ill|Wilhelm Ensslin|de|Wilhelm En\u00dflin}}, \"Julius Nepos\", in ''Paulys Realencyclop\u00e4die der classischen Altertumswissenschaft'', Band XVI,2 (1935), S. 1505\u20131510.</ref> Since Diocletian's palace was in the area, it might have been the same building. \n\nIts second life came when [[Salona]] was largely destroyed in the invasions of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[Slavs]] in the 7th century, though the exact year of the destruction still remains an open debate between archaeologists. Part of the expelled population, now refugees, found shelter inside the palace's strong walls and with them a new, organized city life began.<ref>Charles George Herbermann, ''The Catholic Encyclopedia: An International Work of Reference'' (1913).

Today many restaurants and shops, and some homes can still be found within the walls.\n\nIn the period of the free medieval commune, between the 12th and 14th centuries, there was a greater architectural development, when many medieval houses filled not only Roman buildings but also a large part of the free space of streets and docks. Also completed in this period was the construction of the Romanesque bell tower of the [[Cathedral of Saint Domnius]], which inhabits the building that was originally erected as Jupiter's temple and then used as the Mausoleum of Diocletian.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apollo-magazine.com/how-life-goes-on-in-a-ruined-roman-palace/|title=How life goes on in a ruined Roman palace|date=2016-12-22|website=Apollo Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Middle Ages]], the palace was virtually unknown in the rest of Europe, until the Scottish architect [[Robert Adam]] had the ruins surveyed. Then, with the aid of French artist and antiquary [[Charles-Louis Cl\u00e9risseau]] and several draughtsmen, Adam published ''Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro in Dalmatia'' (London, 1764).<ref>[https://archive.org/details/RuinspalaceEmpe00Adam Text] at Archive.org; [http://library.si.edu/digital-library/book/ruinspalaceempe00adam Text] at the Smithsonian Institution; [http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?id=DLDecArts.AdamRuins Text] at University of Wisconsin</ref>\n\nDiocletian's palace was an inspiration for Adam's new style of [[Neoclassical architecture]]<ref name=\"CMHogan\">Hogan, C.

A few decades later, in 1782, the French painter [[Louis-Fran\u00e7ois Cassas]] created drawings of the palace, published by [[Joseph Lavall\u00e9e]] in 1802 in the chronicles of his voyages.<ref>''Voyage pittoresque et historique de l'Istrie et de la Dalmatie r\u00e9dig\u00e9 d'apr\u00e8s l'Itin\u00e9raire de L.

Diocletian's Palace far transcends local importance because of its degree of preservation. The Palace is one of the most famous and complete architectural and cultural features on the Croatian [[Adriatic]] coast. As the world's most complete remains of a Roman palace, it holds an outstanding place in Mediterranean, European, and world heritage.\n\n==Cultural heritage==\n[[File:Peristyle of Diocletian's Palace in Split, Robert Adam, 1764 (cropped).jpg|thumb|View of the Peristyle in 1764, engraving by [[Robert Adam]]. The Peristyle is the central square of the palace, where the main entrance to Diocletian's quarters (pictured) is located.]]\n\nIn November 1979 [[UNESCO]], in line with the international convention on cultural and natural heritage, adopted a proposal that the historic city of Split built around the Palace should be included in the register of [[World Cultural Heritage]].<ref>[http://w3.mrki.info/split/diokl.html Diocletian Palace]</ref>\n\nIn November 2006 the City Council decided to permit over twenty new buildings within the palace (including a shopping and garage complex), although the palace had been declared a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Monument. It is said that this decision was politically motivated and largely due to lobbying by local property developers. Once the public in 2007 became aware of the project, they petitioned against the decision and won. No new buildings, shopping center or the underground garage were built.\n\nThe [[World Monuments Fund]] has been working on a conservation project at the palace, including surveying structural integrity and cleaning and restoring the stone and plasterwork.\n\nThe palace is depicted on the [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the Croatian 500 [[Croatian kuna|kuna]] banknote, issued in 1993.<ref>[http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/enovcan.htm?tsfsg=5caabbb4dca58151e125c650d3cdae36 Features of Kuna Banknotes] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506012028/http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/enovcan.htm?tsfsg=5caabbb4dca58151e125c650d3cdae36 |date=6 May 2009 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/novcanice/e500k.htm?tsfsg=a649438eb16231e47533d70f5e0ed4c4 500 kuna] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604014206/http://www.hnb.hr/novcan/novcanice/e500k.htm?tsfsg=a649438eb16231e47533d70f5e0ed4c4 |date=4 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Tafel 001a Spalato - Grundriss vom Kaiserpalast - Robert Adam 1764 -.jpg|thumb| Floor plan of Diocletian's palace]]\nThe ground plan of the palace is an irregular rectangle measuring east: 214.97 m, north: 174.74 m, south: 181.65 m (adjusting for the terrain), with sixteen towers projecting from the western, northern, and eastern facades on the facades facing the mainland and four towers on the corners of the square are ground floor gives the palace a characteristic of the [[Roman fortifications|legionary forts]] similar to those on the [[Danube]].<ref>Dixon, Karen R. and Southern, Pat. The Late Roman Army p. 143</ref> \n\nTwo of the six octagonal ground-floor towers were framed by three landing entrances, the six rectangular ground floors of the rectangular floor being between the corner and the octagonal. To date, three corner corners (except southwestern) have been preserved, and only the remains of octagonal and rectangular ones. Three well-preserved landings have been architecturally fragmented, especially the northern one, which was the main approach from [[Salona]]. The south, [[Bronze Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|seaside gate]], small, simple and well preserved. The facade walls of the palace in their lower parts are massive and simple without openings, and in the upper part they are exposed to large arches that are simple to the land, ie on the west, north and east facades. [[Cellars of Diocletian's Palace|Subterranean portions]] of the palace feature [[barrel vault]]ed stonework.\n\n===Outer walls===\nOnly the southern facade, which rose directly from or very near to the sea, was unfortified. The elaborate architectural composition of the arcaded gallery on its upper floor differs from the more severe treatment of the three shore facades. A monumental gate in the middle of each of these walls led to an enclosed courtyard. The southern [[Bronze Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|\u2019Sea Gate\u2019]] (the ''Porta Meridionalis'') was simpler in shape and dimensions than the other three, and it is thought that it was originally intended either as the emperor's private access to the sea, or as a service entrance for supplies.\n\n===The North Gate===\n{{Main|Golden Gate (Diocletian's Palace)}}\n\n[[File:SPLIT-Porta Aurea restitution.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Porta Septemtrionalis]]\nThe Porta septemtrionalis (\"the northern gate) \"is one of the four principal Roman gates into the Palace. Originally the Main gate from which the [[Diocletian|Emperor]] entered the complex, the gate is on the road to the north, towards [[Salona]], the then capital of the Roman province of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and Diocletian's birthplace. It is probably the gate the Emperor entered after his [[abdication]] from the imperial throne on 1 May 305.<ref>https://www.putovnica.net/odredista/hrvatska/split/sto-posjetiti-znamenitosti-u-splitu/zlatna-vrata-u-splitu</ref> Today the 7th century church of [[St Martin's Church (Split)|St Martin]] can be found above the gate, and is open to the public.\n\n===The East Gate===\n{{Main|Silver Gate (Diocletian's Palace)}}\n\n[[File:Split-Roman walls.jpg|thumb|Silver Gate]]\nThe Porta Orientalis (\"the eastern gate\")<ref name=\"split\">{{cite web|url=http://www.split.hr/citylights/10/index_hr.html|title=Split.hr &#124; Srebrna vrata|website=split.hr|accessdate=2019-06-28}}</ref> is one of the four principal Roman gates into the Palace.

Originally a military gate, from which troops entered the complex, the gate is the only one to have remained in continuous use to the present day. During the [[Christian persecution of paganism under Theodosius I|persecutions under Theodosius I]] a relief sculpture of [[Nike (mythology)|Nika]], the Roman Goddess of Victory (which stood on the lintel) was removed from the gate, later in the 5th century, [[Early Christians|Christians]] engraved a [[Christian cross|Cross]] in its place.<ref>https://visitsplit.com/en/523/the-iron-gate</ref><ref>Prijatelj, Kruno, Spomenici Splita i okolice, str. 34.</ref> In the 6th century, above the gate a small church dedicated to [[Theodora (6th century)|St. Teodora]].<ref>https://www.min-kulture.hr/default.aspx?id=6212&IsItSearchRegistar=yes&free=&kat_opcina=&kat_cestica=&klasifikacija=-1&naziv=&smjestaj=&opcina=&zupanija=&vrsta=NEP(P)&unesco=&vrsta_zastite=za%c5%a1ti%c4%87eno+kulturno+dobro&Page=1</ref> This coincided with the complex seeing an [[Migration Period|influx of refugees]] from outlining communities, similar churches were over the [[Golden Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|Golden Gate]], the [[Silver Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|Silver Gate]], and the [[Bronze Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|Bronze Gate]].\n\n===The South Gate===\n{{Main|Bronze Gate (Diocletian's Palace)}}\n\n[[File:Dioklecijanova pala\u010da, Split - jug.JPG|thumb|Part of the southern wall today]]\nThe Porta Meridionalis or \"the southern gate\" is the smaller of the four principal Roman gates into the Palace.

From there, one approached the Emperor's apartment, which stretched 40 m deep along the entire south facade; it is only partly preserved in the upper floor, but its ground-floor, translated substructures that directly bore it are almost completely preserved, so the overall layout and appearance of the upper spaces can be seen given the coincidence of the upper and lower floor plans. On the west side of the upper floor are preserved the remains of a dome hall and two halls with apses, and on the east side are parts of an octagonal dining room ([[triclinium]]) with three halls with a cross floor plan. The wall of the Western Cross Hall is preserved in full height. Diocletian's apartment was interconnected by a long room along the southern fa\u00e7ade (cryptoporticus)<ref> https://visitsplit.com/en/525/vestibule</ref> from which through 42 windows and 3 balconies a view of the sea was opened. Two baths were recently found north of the Emperor's apartment, one adjacent to the west and the other to the eastern halls. Although for many centuries almost completely filled with refuse, most of the substructure is well preserved and indicates the original shape and disposition of the rooms above.\n\n====The Vestibule====\n{{Main|Vestibule (Split)}}\nA rotonda, that was once the first section of the imperial corridor in the Palace that led via [[Peristyle|the Peristyle]] to the Imperial apartments<ref>https://www.lonelyplanet.com/croatia/split/attractions/vestibule/a/poi-sig/1544002/358789</ref> of the Palace. \n\n====The Palace Cellars====\n{{Main|Cellars of Diocletian's Palace}}\n[[File:Split D81 3055 (38620797821).jpg|thumb|Cellars of Diocletian's Palace]]\nSet below what were the Imperial apartments, the Cellars of Diocletian Palace are a set of substructures, located at the southern end of the Palace,<ref name=\"auto2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.absolute-croatia.com/split-region-dalmatia/split/attractions/item/diocletians-palace-basements-split|title=Diocletian's palace basement, Split|website=www.absolute-croatia.com}}</ref> that represent one of the best preserved ancient complexes of their kind in the world.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://visitsplit.com/en/529/the-substructures|title=Split - The Substructures|website=visitsplit.com}}</ref>\n\n====Peristyle====\nA monumental court, called the [[Peristyle]], formed the Northern access to the imperial apartments in front of the Vestibule. It also gave access to Diocletian's mausoleum on the East (today the [[Cathedral of Saint Domnius]]), and to three temples on the West (two of which are now lost, with the third, originally being the [[Temple of Jupiter, Split|temple of Jupiter]], becoming a baptistery). There is also a temple just to the west of the Peristylum called The Temple of [[Aesculapius]], which has a semi-cylindrical roof built of stone blocks, which did not leak until the 1940s when it was covered with a lead roof. The temple was recently restored.\n\n====Northern half====\nThe northern half of the palace, divided into two parts by the main north-south street (''[[cardo]]'') leading from the [[Golden Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|Golden Gate]] (''Porta aurea'') to the Peristyle, is less well preserved. It is usually supposed that each part was a residential complex, housing soldiers, servants, and possibly some other facilities.\n\n====Streets and annex buildings====\nBoth parts of the palace were apparently surrounded by streets,<ref>http://w3.mrki.info/split/diokl.html</ref> leading to the perimeter walls through a rectangular buildings (possibly storage magazines).{{dubious|According to floor-plan, it's rather ALONGSIDE.|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Building materials===\n[[File:SPLIT-Sphinx peristyle.jpg|thumb|Sphinx at the Peristyle]]\nThe Palace is built of white local [[limestone]] and [[marble]] of high quality, most of which was from the Bra\u010d marble quarries on the island of [[Bra\u010d]], of [[tuff]] taken from the nearby river beds, and of brick made in [[Salona|Salonitan]] and other factories. Some material for decoration was imported: [[Egypt]]ian [[granite]] [[column]]s, fine marble for revetments and some capitals produced in workshops in the [[Proconnesos]].\n\n===Egyptian sphinxes===\nThe Palace was decorated with numerous 3500-year-old granite [[sphinx]]es, originating from the site{{dubious|What site? Tomb? Temples?|date=January 2019}} of Egyptian Pharaoh [[Thutmose III]]. Only three have survived the centuries. One is still on the Peristyle, the second sits headless in front of [[Temple of Jupiter, Split|Jupiter's temple]], and a third is housed in the city museum.\n\n==Filming location==\nDiocletian's Palace was used as a location for filming the [[Game of Thrones (season 4)|fourth season]] of the [[HBO]] series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://winteriscoming.net/2013/09/day-72-filming-in-diocletians-palace-zrnovnica/ |title=Day 72: Filming in Diocletian\u2019s Palace & \u017drnovnica |work=WinterIsComing.net |date=27 September 2013 |accessdate=26 April 2014 }}</ref> The palace also hosted a task on the [[The Amazing Race 31|31st season]] of the [[CBS]] reality show ''[[The Amazing Race (American TV series)|The Amazing Race]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.total-croatia-news.com/lifestyle/36524-split|title=Let's Split: The Amazing Race Discovers Croatia in Season 31 (VIDEO)|work=Total Croatia News|last=Rogulj|first=Daniela|date=June 13, 2019|accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/2019/06/jacksons-the-amazing-race-youtube-stars-tyler-oakley-korey-kuhl-take-the-lead.html|title=Jackson\u2019s \u2018The Amazing Race\u2019 YouTube stars Tyler Oakley, Korey Kuhl take the lead|work=[[Booth Newspapers]]|last=McLaren|first=Hunter|date=June 13, 2019|accessdate=December 31, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\n\n\nFile:SPLIT-Model from NE.jpg|Model of the Palace when built \nSPLIT-Farlati restitution.jpg|Reconstruction by Farlatija.\nSPLIT-Mausoleum 3D view.jpg|3D mausoleum cross-section.\nSPLIT-Mausoleum plan.jpg|Mausoleum Layout.\nSPLIT-Mausoleum front restored.jpg|Facade of the mausoleum.\nSPLIT-Mausoleum capital-2.jpg|Pillar from the mausoleum, collapsed drawing.\nSplit4141.jpg|The remains of the forum.\nSPLIT-Porta Aurea plan.jpg|[[Golden Gate (Diocletian's Palace)|Aurea gate]], floorplan.\nSPLIT-Temple restitution 2.jpg|Reconstruction of Jupiter's Temple (St. John's Church).\nSplit2006.2.JPG|[[Vestibule (Split)|The Vestibule]] leading to the cellars of the Palace.\nFile:Split D81 3055 (38620797821).jpg|[[Cellars of Diocletian's Palace]].\nFile:Split D81 3059 (38564116746).jpg|[[Cellars of Diocletian's Palace]].\nFile:Split D81 3061 (37903099964).jpg|[[Cellars of Diocletian's Palace]].\nFile:Split D81 3065 (24748413408).jpg|[[Cellars of Diocletian's Palace]].\nFile:Split D81 3066 (26844247179).jpg|[[Cellars of Diocletian's Palace]].\nFile:Diokletian Palace.JPG|[[Cellars of Diocletian's palace]].\nDiocletian's Palace street 1.jpg|Original Roman stone pavement.\nFile:Split IMG 8102.jpg|Campanile of [[Cathedral of Saint Domnius|Split Cathedral]].\nFile:20130603 Split 085.jpg|Interior image of the [[St Martin's Church (Split)|Church of St Martin's]] with a view of the chancel screen (June 2013).\n\n\n \n\n\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Croatia}}\n*[[List of Roman domes]]\n*[[Vestibule (Split)]]\n*[[Cellars of Diocletian's Palace]]\n*The [[Bronze Gate (Diocletian's Palace)]]\n*The [[Golden Gate (Diocletian's Palace)]]\n*The [[Iron Gate (Diocletian's Palace)]]\n*The [[Silver Gate (Diocletian's Palace)]]\n*[[Red Peristyle]] (an act of urban intervention done on the main square of the palace)\n*[[Roman architecture]]\n*[[Marjan, Split]]\n*[[Salona]]\n*[[Dalmatia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|33em|refs=<ref name=DEATH>{{cite journal |last=Nakamura |first=Byron J. |title=When Did Diocletian Die?
