However, Hus was summoned to attend the [[Council of Constance]], which decided that he was a heretic and released him to the secular authority, which sentenced him to be burned at the stake on 6 July 1415.  From 1419 to 1437 were a series of [[Hussite Wars]] initially between various Catholic rulers and the Hussites, and then the political situation continued into a Hussite civil war between the more compromising [[Utraquism|Utraquists]] and the radical [[Taborite]]s. In 1434, an army of Utraquists and Catholics defeated the Taborites at the [[Battle of Lipany]].  The Utraquists signed the [[Compacts of Basel]] on 5 July 1436.\n\nWithin fifty years of Hus' death, a contingent of his followers had become independently organised as the \"Bohemian Brethren\" (''\u010ce\u0161t\u00ed brat\u0159i'') or [[Unity of the Brethren]] (''Jednota bratrsk\u00e1''), which was founded in [[Kunvald]], Bohemia, in 1457. A brother known as Gregory the Patriarch was very influential in forming the group, as well as the teachings of [[Peter Chelcicky]]. This group held to a strict obedience to the Sermon on the Mount, which included non-swearing of oaths, non-resistance, and not accumulating wealth. Because of this, they considered themselves separate from the majority Hussites that did not hold those teachings. They received episcopal ordination through the [[Waldensians]] in 1467.<ref name=Rican1992 />{{rp|36 ff}}<ref name=Crews2008 />{{rp|107 ff}} These were some of the earliest [[Protestant]]s, rebelling against Rome some fifty years before [[Martin Luther]].<ref name=Rican1992 /><ref name=Crews2008 /> By the middle of the 16th century as many as 90 per cent of the inhabitants of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]] were [[Protestantism|Protestant]].<ref name=\"Nabozenstvi\">N\u00e1bo\u017eenstv\u00ed a modern\u00ed \u010desk\u00e1 spole\u010dnost, David V\u00e1clav\u00edk, Grada Publishing a.s., 2010, page 53</ref> The majority of the nobility was Protestant, and the schools and printing-shops established by the Moravian Church were flourishing.\n\nProtestantism had a strong influence in the education of the population. Even in the middle of the 16th century there was not a single town without a Protestant school in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian crown lands]], and many had more than one, mostly with two to six teachers each. In [[Jihlava]], a principal Protestant center in Moravia, there were five major schools: two German, one Czech, one for girls and one teaching in Latin, which was at the level of a [[gymnasium (school)|high/grammar school]], lecturing on Latin, Greek and Hebrew, Rhetorics, Dialectics, fundamentals of Philosophy and fine arts, as well as religion according to the [[Augsburg Confession|Lutheran Augustana]].<ref name=\"elvert\">{{Cite journal\n  | last = d'Elvert\n  | first = Christian\n  | authorlink = Christian d'Elvert\n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Geschichte der Studien-, Schul- und Erziehungs- Anstalten in M\u00e4hren und Oesterreichisch Schlesien, insbesondere der olm\u00fctzer Universit\u00e4t, in den neueren Zeiten\n  | journal = Gesellschaft zur Bef\u00f6rderung des Ackerbaues, der Natur- und Landeskunde\n  | volume = 10\n  | issue = \n  | pages = \n  | page = \n  | publisher = \n  | location = \n  | year = 1857\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EpwAAAAAcAAJ&dq=B%C3%96SENSELLE&hl=cs&pg=PR27#v=onepage&q=B%C3%96SENSELLE&f=false\n  | issn = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n===Counter-Reformation===\n\nWith the [[Charles University#Protestant academy .281419.E2.80.931622.29|University of Prague]] also firmly in hands of Protestants, the local Catholic church was unable to compete in the field of education. Therefore, the Jesuits were invited, with the backing of the Catholic Habsburg rulers, to come to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]] and establish a number of Catholic educational institutions. One of these is the [[Palack\u00fd University, Olomouc|university]] in the Moravian capital of [[Olomouc]]. In 1582 they forced closure of local Protestant schools.\n\nIn 1617, [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Matthias]] had his fiercely Catholic brother [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Styria]] elected King of Bohemia, but in 1618 [[Protestant]] Bohemian noblemen, who feared losing their religious freedom,<ref name=\"Polisensky\">Josef V. Poli\u0161ensk\u00fd, ''The Thirty Years War'', University of California Press, 1971.</ref> started the [[Bohemian Revolt]]. The Revolt started by the unplanned second [[Defenestrations of Prague]] and was defeated in 1620 in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] near Prague. As consequence the local Protestant noblemen were either executed or expelled from the country while the Habsburgs placed Catholic (and mostly German speaking) nobility in their place. The war, plague, and subsequent disruption led to a decline in the population from over 3 million to some 800,000 people. By 1622 the entire education system was in the hands of Jesuits and all Protestant schools were closed.\n\nThe Brethren were forced to operate underground and eventually dispersed across [[Northern Europe]] as far as the [[Low Countries]], where their [[Bishop]] [[John Amos Comenius]] attempted to direct a resurgence. The largest remaining communities of the Brethren were located in [[Leszno]] ({{lang-de|Lissa}}) in [[Poland]], which had historically strong ties with the Czechs, and small, isolated groups in [[Moravia]]. These latter are referred to as \"the Hidden Seed\" which John Amos Comenius had prayed would preserve the evangelical faith in the land of the fathers.\n\nIn addition to the Renewed Unitas Fratrum or Moravian Church, which preserves the Unitas Fratrum's three orders of [[Bishop|episcopal]] ordination, The [[Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren]] and the [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] also continue the Hussite tradition in the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and [[Slovakia|Slovak]] Republics today, although they only account for [[Religion in the Czech Republic|0.8% of the Czech population]] (which is 79.4% non-religious, and 10.4% Catholic).\n\n===Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine, 18th-century renewal===\n{{unref|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Haidt Zizendorf.JPG|thumb|[[Nicolaus Zinzendorf]] preaching to people from many nations]]\n\nIn 1722, a small group of Bohemian Brethren (the \"Hidden Seed\") who had been living in northern [[Moravia]] as an illegal underground remnant surviving in Catholic setting of the Habsburg Empire for nearly 100 years, arrived at the [[Berthelsdorf]] estate of [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf|Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf]], a nobleman who had been brought up in the traditions of [[Lutheran]] [[Pietism]]. Out of a personal commitment to helping the poor and needy, he agreed to a request from their leader ([[Christian David]], an itinerant carpenter) that they be allowed to settle on his lands in [[Upper Lusatia]], which is in present-day [[Saxony]] in the eastern part of modern-day [[Germany]]. The Margraviates of Upper and Lower Lusatia were governed in personal union by the Saxon rulers and enjoyed great autonomy, especially in religious questions.\n\nThe refugees established a new village called [[Herrnhut]], about 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) from Berthelsdorf. The town initially grew steadily, but major religious disagreements emerged and by 1727 the community was divided into factions. Count Zinzendorf worked to bring about unity in the town and the ''Brotherly Agreement'' was adopted by the community on 12 May 1727. This is considered the beginning of the renewal. Then, on 13 August 1727 the community underwent a dramatic transformation when the inhabitants of Herrnhut \"learned to love one another\", following an experience that they attributed to a visitation of the [[Holy Spirit]], similar to that recorded in the [[Bible]] on the day of [[Pentecost]].\n\nHerrnhut grew rapidly following this transforming revival and became the centre of a major movement for Christian renewal and mission during the 18th century. The [[Bishop|episcopal]] [[ordination]] of the Ancient Unitas Fratrum was transferred in 1735 to the Renewed Unitas Fratrum by the Unity's two surviving bishops, [[Daniel Ernst Jablonski]] and Christian Sitkovius. The carpenter [[David Nitschmann der Bischof|David Nitschmann]] and, later, Count von Zinzendorf, were the first two bishops of the Renewed Unity.  Moravian historians identify the main achievements of this period as:\n\n# Setting up a watch of [[continual prayer|continuous prayer]] that ran uninterrupted, 24 hours a day, for 100 years.\n# Originating the ''[[Daily Watchwords]]''.\n# Establishing more than 30 settlements internationally on the Herrnhut model, which emphasized prayer and worship, and a form of communal living in which simplicity of lifestyle and generosity with wealth were held to be important spiritual attributes. The purpose of these communities was to assist the members resident there in the sanctification of their lives, to provide a meeting place for Christians from different confessional backgrounds, to provide Christian training for their own children and the children of their friends and supporters and to provide support for the Moravian Mission work throughout the world. As a result, although personal property was held, divisions between social groups and extremes of wealth and poverty were largely eliminated.\n# Being the first Protestant church body to begin missionary work; and\n# Forming many hundreds of small renewal groups operating within the existing churches of Europe, known as \"diaspora societies\". These groups encouraged personal prayer and worship, Bible study, confession of sins and mutual accountability.\n\n===Missions===\n[[File:Group associated with the Moravian Church by Johann Valentin Haidt.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a group of Moravian Church members with King [[George II of Great Britain]], attributed to [[Johann Valentin Haidt]], circa 1752\u20131754]]\nAlong with the [[Royal Danish Mission College]], the Moravian missionaries were the first large-scale [[Mission (Christian)|Protestant missionary movement]]. They sent out the first missionaries when there were only 300 inhabitants in Herrnhut. Within 30 years, the church sent hundreds of Christian missionaries to many parts of the world, including the [[Caribbean]], [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] (see [[Christian Munsee]]), the [[Arctic]], [[Africa]], and the [[Far East]]. They were the first to send lay people (rather than clergy) as missionaries, the first Protestant denomination to minister to slaves, and the first Protestant presence in many countries.\n\nOwing to Zinzendorf's personal contacts with their royalty, the first Moravian missions were directed to the [[Denmark-Norway|Dano-Norwegian Empire]]. While attending the coronation of [[Christian VI of Denmark]], Zinzendorf was profoundly struck by two [[Kalaallit people|Inuit]] converts of [[Hans Egede]]'s [[Kangeq|mission in Greenland]] and also by an African from the [[West Indies]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Knight | first1 = C. | title = The Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Volumes 15\u201316 | publisher = C.

For instance, they founded one in 1740 at the Mohican village of ''[[Shekomeko]]'' in present-day [[Dutchess County, New York]]. The converted Mohican people formed the first native Christian congregation in the present-day United States of America. Because of local hostility to the Mohican, the Moravian support of the Mohican led to rumors of their being secret [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], trying to ally the Mohican with France in the ongoing [[French and Indian Wars]].\n\nAlthough supporters defended their work, at the end of 1744, the colonial government based at [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]] expelled the Moravians from New York.<ref>[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/town/pineplains/history.html Philip H.

The mission was established on [[Christmas Eve]], and was named Bethlehem, after the [[Bethlehem|Biblical town in Judea]]. There, they ministered to the Algonquian [[Lenape Nation|Lenape]]. [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] is today the seventh largest city in Pennsylvania. In 1772, the first civilized settlement of what later became [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania]] occurred when Reverend John Ettwein, a Moravian missionary, arrived there with a band of 241 Christianized [[Delaware Indians]].<ref name=Guide>''Pennsylvania: A Guide to the Keystone State''.

Google Books, & Amazon Kindle.</ref>\n\nColonies were also founded in North Carolina, where Moravians led by Bishop August Gottlieb Spangenberg purchased 98,985 acres (400.58 km2) from [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville]]. This large tract of land was named ''die [[Wachau]]'', or [[Wachovia, North Carolina|Wachovia]], after one of Zinzendorf's ancestral estates on the [[Danube River]] in [[Lower Austria]]. Other early settlements included Bethabara (1753), Bethania (1759) and Salem (now referred to as [[Old Salem]] in [[Winston-Salem]] North Carolina) (1766).\n\nIn 1801 the Moravians established Springplace mission to the [[Cherokee Nation]] in what is now [[Murray County, Georgia|Murray County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Coinciding with the [[Trail of Tears|forced removal]] of the Cherokees to Oklahoma, this mission was replaced in 1842 by New Springplace in [[Oaks, Oklahoma]]. Due to [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-related violence, New Springplace closed in 1862, and resumed during the 1870s. Finally, in 1898, the Moravian Church discontinued their missionary engagement with the Cherokees, and New Springplace, now the Oaks Indian Mission, was transferred to the [[Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church]].<ref name=\"EOHC-Oaks\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=OA003 Rose Stauber] \"Oaks,\" ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''. Accessed March 26, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe start of far-flung missionary work necessitated the establishment of independently administered provinces. So, from about 1732,<ref name=\"S&H\"/>{{Rp|7}} the history of the church becomes the history of its provinces.\n\nEventually, the Moravian missions in [[Australia]] and [[Greenland]] were transferred to the local Presbyterian and Lutheran Churches respectively.\n\nThe first mission station in present-day [[South Africa]] was established by the Moravian Georg Schmidt at [[Genadendal]] in 1738.  The mission at [[Wupperthal]], established by the [[Rhenish Missionary Society]] was eventually transferred to the Moravian Church.\n\n==Present==\n[[file:Mary Greenwood on gravestones born 1752.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Greenwoord was buried in [[Gracehill]] in [[County Antrim]] in 1752.

In many places it observes the convention of the [[lovefeast]], originally started in 1727. It uses older and traditional music in worship. Brass music, congregational singing and choral music continue to be very important in Moravian congregations. In addition, in some older congregations, Moravians are buried in a traditional [[God's Acre]], a graveyard with only flat gravestones, signifying the equality of the dead before God and organized by sex, age and marital status rather than family.\n\nThe Moravians continue their long tradition of missionary work, for example in the Caribbean, where the Jamaican Moravian Church has begun work in Cuba and in Africa where the Moravian Church in Tanzania has missions in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. This is reflected in their broad global distribution. The Moravians in Germany, whose central settlement remains at [[Herrnhut]], are highly active in education and social work. The American Moravian Church sponsors the [[Moravian College]] and Seminary. The largest concentration of Moravians today is in [[Tanzania]].\n\nThe motto of the Moravian Church is: \"[[In necessariis unitas, in dubiis libertas, in omnibus caritas|In essentials, unity; in nonessentials, liberty; and in all things, love]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moravian.org/the-moravian-church/what-moravians-believe-2/|title=What Moravians Believe \u00ab The Moravian Church \u00ab Moravian Church of North America|website=Moravian.org|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome Moravian scholars point to a different formula as a guide to constructive debate about faith. This formula was first advanced by [[Luke of Prague]] (1460\u20131528), one of the bishops of the ancient Unitas Fratrum. Luke taught that one must distinguish between things that are essential, ministerial or incidental to salvation. The essentials are God's work of creation, redemption and sanctification, as well as the response of the believer through faith, hope and love. Things ministerial are such items as the Bible, church, sacraments, doctrine and priesthood. These mediate the sacred and should thus be treated with respect, but they are not considered essential. Finally, incidentals include things such as vestments or names of services that may reasonably vary from place to place\n\n==Organization==\n===Provinces===\nFor its global work, the Church is organised into Unity Provinces, Mission Provinces and Mission Areas and four regions of Africa, Caribbean and Latin America, Northern America, and Europe. The categorisation is based on the level of independence of the Province.

Formerly the West Himalayan Province (1853) and designated a Unity Undertaking in 1967.\n\n[[Tanzania]] is divided into seven provinces because of the size of country and the numbers of people in the church. The \"Moravian Church in Tanzania\" co-ordinates the work in the nation.\n\nThe lists above, except for some details given under 'Other areas', can be found in ''The Moravian Almanac''.<ref name=Almanac>The Moravian Almanac is published annually (October) as a supplement to the devotional book ''Daily Watchwords''. Most Provinces publish their own almanac with details of local congregations and the wider Provinces. Copies may be obtained from the Moravian Church House (office) of any province (for addresses see the provinces pages).</ref>\n\nEach Province is governed by a [[synod]], made up of representatives from each congregation plus ''ex officio'' members.\n\nThe Synod elects the Provincial Board (aka Provincial Elders' Conference or PEC<ref>In Moravian usage, Elder is a title applicable to the members of any church board (conference) whether at provincial or congregational level. The term refers to responsible people who, commanding the respect of their fellow members, have been elected, at provincial level by the Synod, and at local level by the Congregation Council. A Board of Elders always acts collegially, not individually<sup>[7]</sup>.</ref>) to be responsible for the work of the Province and its international links between Synods.\n\n===Districts===\nMany, but not all, of the Provinces are divided into Districts.\n\n===Congregations===\n[[File:Neudietendorf Bruederkirche-Innen1.jpg|thumb|A Moravian church in [[Neudietendorf]] in [[Thuringia]] in Germany]]\n\nEach congregation belongs to a district and has spiritual and financial responsibilities for work in its own area as well as provincially. The Congregation Council (all the members of a congregation) usually meets twice a year and annually elects the Joint Board of Elders and Trustees that acts as an executive.\n\nIn some provinces two or more congregations may be grouped into circuits, under the care of one minister.\n\n===Unity Synod===\nThe Unity Synod meets every seven years and is attended by delegates from the different Unity Provinces and affiliated Provinces.\n\n===Unity Board===\nThe Unity Board is made up of one member from each Provincial Board, and acts as an executive committee between Unity Synods. It meets three times between Synods but much of its work is done by correspondence and postal voting.\n\nThe '''President''' of the Unity Board (who is elected by the Board for two years and not allowed to serve for more than two terms) works from his/her own Provincial office. The '''Unity Business Administrator''' is an officer appointed by the Unity Board to administer the day-to-day affairs of the Unity through the office of the Unity.\n\n==Orders of Ministry==\nOrdained ministry in the Moravian Church emphasizes the pastoral role. A candidate for ministry who has been approved by their home province and has completed the prescribed course of study (usually a Master of Divinity degree in the US and Europe) may be ordained a Deacon upon acceptance of a call. Deacons may serve in a pastoral office and administer sacraments. A deacon is normally supervised by a presbyter who serves as mentor. After several years of satisfactory service, the Deacon may be consecrated as a Presbyter. Presbyters function in the local congregation in the same manner as deacons, but may also\nserve to mentor deacons and may be assigned to other leadership roles in a particular province.\n\nAn Acolyte is a layperson who has received approval to assist the pastor in a specific local congregation. The acolyte may assist in the serving of Holy Communion but may not consecrate the elements.\n\nThe highest order of ministry is that of a bishop. Bishops are elected by Provincial Synods usually through ecclesiastical ballot without nomination. In the Moravian Church, bishops do not have an administrative role but rather serve as spiritual leaders and pastors to the pastors. Bishops serve the worldwide Unity.<ref>\"Church Order of the Unitas Fratrum\", 2009, Chapter XIII.</ref> The Moravian Church is reputed to have received the [[apostolic succession]] through the Waldensian Church, but the historicity of this is disputed.  In Berlin, 1735, the Renewed Unity, i.e. the Moravian Brethren in Herrnhut, received the historic episcopal ordination from the two surviving bishops of the Ancient Unity: Bishop [[John Amos Comenius|John Amos Comenius']] grandson [[Daniel Ernst Jablonski]] and Christian Sitkovius. This bishop's consecration continues today.\n\n==Beliefs==\n\nIn her ''Book of Order''<ref name=UBoO>Church Order of the Unitas Fratrum, published by order of the Unity Synod.</ref><ref name=UBoO-Online>[http://www.unitasfratrum.org/pages/ground_unity.html The Ground of the Unity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122053034/http://www.unitasfratrum.org/pages/ground_unity.html |date=2007-11-22 }}</ref> the several provinces of the Moravian Unity accept:\n*The three [[Ecumenical Creeds]]: [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles']], [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and [[Athanasian Creed|Athanasian]]\n*The first 21 articles of the Unaltered [[Augsburg Confession]]\n*The Confession of the Unity of the Bohemian Brethren of 1535\n*The [[Barmen Declaration]] of 1934\n*The [[Small Catechism]] of [[Martin Luther]]\n*The Synod of Berne/''Berner Synodus'' of 1532\n*[[The Thirty-Nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]]\n*The [[Heidelberg Catechism]]\n\nAccording to the Ground of the Unity<ref name=UBoO/><ref name=UBoO-Online/> of 1957, fundamental beliefs include but are not limited to:\n*The [[Holy Trinity]]: the Father, the Son or Logos/Word, and the Holy Spirit.\n*The Fatherhood of God\n*God's Love for fallen humanity\n*The [[Incarnation]] of God in the God/Man [[Jesus Christ]]\n*Jesus' sacrificial death for the sinful rebellion of humanity\n*Jesus' [[Resurrection]], [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] and Exaltation to the Right Hand of the Father\n*Jesus' sending of the [[Holy Spirit]] to strengthen, sustain and empower believers\n*Jesus' eventual return, in majesty, [[Last Judgment|to judge the living and the dead]]\n*The Kingdom of Christ shall never end\n*There is one [[Baptism]] for the forgiveness of sins.  Rebaptism is not allowed.\n*Infants are baptized most commonly, but all forms of baptism are accepted (infant or adult; pouring, sprinkling or immersion).\n*Moravian doctrine teaches that the Body and Blood of Christ are present in [[Holy Communion]]. Without seeking to explain the \"Mode\" or the \"How\" of the Presence of Jesus' Body and Blood in the Eucharist, they teach a [[sacramental union]] whereby with the Bread and the Wine the Body and Blood are also received.  Individual believers are allowed to believe in other interpretations, however. Cf. the \"Easter Morning Litany\" of the Moravian Church, a statement of faith, in the Moravian Book of Worship, p.&nbsp;85.\n\nThese tenets of classical Christianity are not unique to the Moravian Church. The emphasis in both the Ancient Unity and the Renewed Unity is on Christian living and the fellowship of believers as a true witness to a vibrant Christian Faith.\n\n===Spirit of the Moravian Church===\n\nAn account of the ethos of the Moravian Church is given by one of its British bishops, Clarence H. Shawe.<ref>Rt Revd C H Shawe, DD (1977), ''The Spirit of the Moravian Church'', London, The Moravian Book Room.</ref> In a lecture series delivered at the Moravian Theological Seminary in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Shawe described the Spirit of the Moravian Church as having five characteristics: simplicity, happiness, unintrusiveness, fellowship, and the ideal of service.\n\n'''''Simplicity''''' is a focus on the essentials of faith and a lack of interest in the niceties of doctrinal definition. Shawe quotes Zinzendorf's remark that \"The Apostles say: 'We believe we have salvation through the grace of Jesus Christ....' If I can only teach a person that catechism I have made him a divinity scholar for all time\" (Shawe, 1977, p.&nbsp;9). From this simplicity flow secondary qualities of genuineness and practicality.\n\n'''''Happiness''''' is the natural and spontaneous response to God's free and gracious gift of salvation. Again Shawe quotes Zinzendorf: \"There is a difference between a genuine Pietist and a genuine Moravian. The Pietist has his sin in the foreground and looks at the wounds of Jesus; the Moravian has the wounds in the forefront and looks from them upon his sin. The Pietist in his timidity is comforted by the wounds; the Moravian in his happiness is shamed by his sin\" (p.&nbsp;13).\n\n'''''Unintrusiveness''''' is based on the Moravian belief that God positively wills the existence of a variety of churches to cater for different spiritual needs. There is no need to win converts from other churches. The source of Christian unity is not legal form but everyone's heart-relationship with the Saviour.\n\n'''''Fellowship''''' is based on this heart-relationship. Shawe says: \"The Moravian ideal has been to gather together kindred hearts.... Where there are 'Christian hearts in love united', there fellowship is possible in spite of differences of intellect and intelligence, of thought, opinion, taste and outlook. ... Fellowship [in Zinzendorf's time] meant not only a bridging of theological differences but also of social differences; the artisan and aristocrat were brought together as brothers and sat as equal members on the same committee\" (pp.&nbsp;21,22).\n\n'''''The ideal of service''''' entails happily having the attitude of a servant. This shows itself partly in faithful service in various roles within congregations but more importantly in service of the world \"by the extension of the Kingdom of God\". Historically, this has been evident in educational and especially missionary work. Shawe remarks that \"none could give themselves more freely to the spread of the gospel than those Moravian emigrants who, by settling in Herrnhut [i.e., on Zinzendorf's estate], had gained release from suppression and persecution\" (p.&nbsp;26).\n\n==Worship==\n\n* [[List of hymnals#Moravian Church|Hymn Books]]\n* Liturgy\n* the Sacrament of the Holy Communion\n* The Sacrament of Baptism, Infants and Adults\n* Marriage\n* Confirmation\n* [[Christian Burial]]\n* Ordination Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons\n* Consecration of church buildings and facilities\n\n==Traditions==\n\n[[File:Lovefeast at Bethania Moravian Church.jpg|thumb|350px|A Moravian [[diener]] serves bread to fellow members of her congregation during the celebration of a [[lovefeast]].]]\n* [[Lovefeast]]\n* Settlements\n* Cup of Covenant\n* [[Christingle]] (object) and Christingle service\n* [[Hosanna#Other examples of modern usage|Hosanna Anthem]]\n* [[Moravian star|Moravian Advent star]]\n* ''[[Daily Watchwords]]'', sometimes called Moravian Daily Texts\n* [[Advent]] Wreath and Candles\n* Passion Week/ [[Holy Week]] Reading Services\n* [[God's Acre]] and [[Easter]] [[sunrise service]]\n* [[Sortition| Drawing of lots]]\n* [[Moravian music|Music]]\n* [[Watch Night]] Service\n* [[Dead house]]\n\n==Former traditions==\n\n* The drawing of \"lots\" in decision making\n* Single Brethren's and Single Sisters' Houses: in the old original Settlement Congregations of Europe, Britain and the US, there were separate Houses caring for the spiritual and also temporal welfare of the Choirs of Single Brethren, Single Sisters, Widows.<ref name=BBoO>''Book of Order, The Moravian Church in Great Britain and Ireland'', 2002.</ref>\n* Wide/Short layout of church interiors\n* Separate seating of sexes in churches\n* Mission ships (the ''Harmony'' and the ''Snow Irene'')\n* Choirs: the word \"Choir\" has been used in the Moravian tradition since the 18th century to indicate a group of congregation members classified according to age and sex.

Most provinces are also members of their national councils of churches, such as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland (EKD)]] in Germany and the [[National Council of Churches]] of Christ in the US, the all African Council of Churches, the Caribbean Council of Churches, the Jamaica Council of Churches. The American Southern Province was instrumental in the founding the North Carolina Council of Churches. The British Province is of the [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]] (formerly the [[British Council of Churches]]) and has an interim Communion agreement with the [[Church of England]]. The two North American provinces are in full communion with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA). The Northern Province of the Moravian Church voted June 18, 2010 to enter into full communion with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]. The Moravian Church's Southern Province also voted to enter into full communion with the Episcopal Church during its synod in September 2010. Each province can independently enter into full communion relationships.<ref>[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/79425_123037_ENG_HTM.htm Episcopal Life Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623001846/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/79425_123037_ENG_HTM.htm |date=2010-06-23 }}</ref> In the 1980s there were discussions in England by which an agreement was created that would have created full communion between the Moravians, [[Presbyterians]], [[Methodists]], and the [[Church of England]]. The Presbyterians and Methodists would have accepted the [[Historic Episcopate]], but since the Moravians already had this, they would have changed nothing. This agreement fell through because the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] did not give approval.\n\nOne aspect of Moravian history and mission is the so-called \"Diaspora\" work in Germany and Eastern Europe, seeking to deepen and encourage the Christian life among members of the territorial churches, particularly in [[Poland]] and the [[Baltic states]], but also throughout the German-speaking lands. Count Zinzendorf's ideal was a fellowship of all Christians, regardless of denominational names, and the Moravian Brethren sought in the Diaspora not to convert people to the Moravian Church but to awaken the hearts of believers and make them better members of the churches to which they already belonged. At first the object of suspicion, in the course of time the Moravian Diaspora workers became valued co-workers in eastern Europe. This Diaspora work suffered almost total destruction in World War II, but is still carried on within the territorial churches of Germany. With the restored independence of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]], it was revealed that much of the Diaspora Work there had been kept alive in spite of domination by the former [[Soviet Union]] and had even borne fruit.\n\n==Historical societies==\n* American North: ''the Moravian Historical Society'' and Historic Bethlehem (Pennsylvania)\n* American South: ''the Wachovia Historical Society'' as well as [[Old Salem]]\n* British: Moravian Church House, London\n* Continental Province ''Verein f\u00fcr Geschichts- und Gegenwartsfragen der Br\u00fcdergemeine''\n* \u201eVia exulantis\", Suchdol nad Odrou (Zauchtenthal or Zauchtel), The Moravian Brethren's Museum.

However, Hus was summoned to attend the [[Council of Constance]], which decided that he was a heretic and released him to the secular authority, which sentenced him to be burned at the stake on 6 July 1415.  From 1419 to 1437 were a series of [[Hussite Wars]] initially between various Catholic rulers and the Hussites, and then the political situation continued into a Hussite civil war between the more compromising [[Utraquism|Utraquists]] and the radical [[Taborite]]s. In 1434, an army of Utraquists and Catholics defeated the Taborites at the [[Battle of Lipany]].  The Utraquists signed the [[Compacts of Basel]] on 5 July 1436.\n\nWithin fifty years of Hus' death, a contingent of his followers had become independently organised as the \"Bohemian Brethren\" (''\u010ce\u0161t\u00ed brat\u0159i'') or [[Unity of the Brethren]] (''Jednota bratrsk\u00e1''), which was founded in [[Kunvald]], Bohemia, in 1457. A brother known as Gregory the Patriarch was very influential in forming the group, as well as the teachings of [[Peter Chelcicky]]. This group held to a strict obedience to the Sermon on the Mount, which included non-swearing of oaths, non-resistance, and not accumulating wealth. Because of this, they considered themselves separate from the majority Hussites that did not hold those teachings. They received episcopal ordination through the [[Waldensians]] in 1467.<ref name=Rican1992 />{{rp|36 ff}}<ref name=Crews2008 />{{rp|107 ff}} These were some of the earliest [[Protestant]]s, rebelling against Rome some fifty years before [[Martin Luther]].<ref name=Rican1992 /><ref name=Crews2008 /> By the middle of the 16th century as many as 90 per cent of the inhabitants of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]] were [[Protestantism|Protestant]].<ref name=\"Nabozenstvi\">N\u00e1bo\u017eenstv\u00ed a modern\u00ed \u010desk\u00e1 spole\u010dnost, David V\u00e1clav\u00edk, Grada Publishing a.s., 2010, page 53</ref> The majority of the nobility was Protestant, and the schools and printing-shops established by the Moravian Church were flourishing.\n\nProtestantism had a strong influence in the education of the population. Even in the middle of the 16th century there was not a single town without a Protestant school in the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian crown lands]], and many had more than one, mostly with two to six teachers each. In [[Jihlava]], a principal Protestant center in Moravia, there were five major schools: two German, one Czech, one for girls and one teaching in Latin, which was at the level of a [[gymnasium (school)|high/grammar school]], lecturing on Latin, Greek and Hebrew, Rhetorics, Dialectics, fundamentals of Philosophy and fine arts, as well as religion according to the [[Augsburg Confession|Lutheran Augustana]].<ref name=\"elvert\">{{Cite journal\n  | last = d'Elvert\n  | first = Christian\n  | authorlink = Christian d'Elvert\n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Geschichte der Studien-, Schul- und Erziehungs- Anstalten in M\u00e4hren und Oesterreichisch Schlesien, insbesondere der olm\u00fctzer Universit\u00e4t, in den neueren Zeiten\n  | journal = Gesellschaft zur Bef\u00f6rderung des Ackerbaues, der Natur- und Landeskunde\n  | volume = 10\n  | issue = \n  | pages = \n  | page = \n  | publisher = \n  | location = \n  | year = 1857\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EpwAAAAAcAAJ&dq=B%C3%96SENSELLE&hl=cs&pg=PR27#v=onepage&q=B%C3%96SENSELLE&f=false\n  | issn = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n===Counter-Reformation===\n\nWith the [[Charles University#Protestant academy .281419.E2.80.931622.29|University of Prague]] also firmly in hands of Protestants, the local Catholic church was unable to compete in the field of education. Therefore, the Jesuits were invited, with the backing of the Catholic Habsburg rulers, to come to the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]] and establish a number of Catholic educational institutions. One of these is the [[Palack\u00fd University, Olomouc|university]] in the Moravian capital of [[Olomouc]]. In 1582 they forced closure of local Protestant schools.\n\nIn 1617, [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Matthias]] had his fiercely Catholic brother [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand of Styria]] elected King of Bohemia, but in 1618 [[Protestant]] Bohemian noblemen, who feared losing their religious freedom,<ref name=\"Polisensky\">Josef V. Poli\u0161ensk\u00fd, ''The Thirty Years War'', University of California Press, 1971.</ref> started the [[Bohemian Revolt]]. The Revolt started by the unplanned second [[Defenestrations of Prague]] and was defeated in 1620 in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] near Prague. As consequence the local Protestant noblemen were either executed or expelled from the country while the Habsburgs placed Catholic (and mostly German speaking) nobility in their place. The war, plague, and subsequent disruption led to a decline in the population from over 3 million to some 800,000 people. By 1622 the entire education system was in the hands of Jesuits and all Protestant schools were closed.\n\nThe Brethren were forced to operate underground and eventually dispersed across [[Northern Europe]] as far as the [[Low Countries]], where their [[Bishop]] [[John Amos Comenius]] attempted to direct a resurgence. The largest remaining communities of the Brethren were located in [[Leszno]] ({{lang-de|Lissa}}) in [[Poland]], which had historically strong ties with the Czechs, and small, isolated groups in [[Moravia]]. These latter are referred to as \"the Hidden Seed\" which John Amos Comenius had prayed would preserve the evangelical faith in the land of the fathers.\n\nIn addition to the Renewed Unitas Fratrum or Moravian Church, which preserves the Unitas Fratrum's three orders of [[Bishop|episcopal]] ordination, The [[Evangelical Church of Czech Brethren]] and the [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]] also continue the Hussite tradition in the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and [[Slovakia|Slovak]] Republics today, although they only account for [[Religion in the Czech Republic|0.8% of the Czech population]] (which is 79.4% non-religious, and 10.4% Catholic).\n\n===Herrnhuter Br\u00fcdergemeine, 18th-century renewal===\n{{unref|section|date=February 2019}}\n[[File:Haidt Zizendorf.JPG|thumb|[[Nicolaus Zinzendorf]] preaching to people from many nations]]\n\nIn 1722, a small group of Bohemian Brethren (the \"Hidden Seed\") who had been living in northern [[Moravia]] as an illegal underground remnant surviving in Catholic setting of the Habsburg Empire for nearly 100 years, arrived at the [[Berthelsdorf]] estate of [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf|Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf]], a nobleman who had been brought up in the traditions of [[Lutheran]] [[Pietism]]. Out of a personal commitment to helping the poor and needy, he agreed to a request from their leader ([[Christian David]], an itinerant carpenter) that they be allowed to settle on his lands in [[Upper Lusatia]], which is in present-day [[Saxony]] in the eastern part of modern-day [[Germany]]. The Margraviates of Upper and Lower Lusatia were governed in personal union by the Saxon rulers and enjoyed great autonomy, especially in religious questions.\n\nThe refugees established a new village called [[Herrnhut]], about 2 miles (3&nbsp;km) from Berthelsdorf. The town initially grew steadily, but major religious disagreements emerged and by 1727 the community was divided into factions. Count Zinzendorf worked to bring about unity in the town and the ''Brotherly Agreement'' was adopted by the community on 12 May 1727. This is considered the beginning of the renewal. Then, on 13 August 1727 the community underwent a dramatic transformation when the inhabitants of Herrnhut \"learned to love one another\", following an experience that they attributed to a visitation of the [[Holy Spirit]], similar to that recorded in the [[Bible]] on the day of [[Pentecost]].\n\nHerrnhut grew rapidly following this transforming revival and became the centre of a major movement for Christian renewal and mission during the 18th century. The [[Bishop|episcopal]] [[ordination]] of the Ancient Unitas Fratrum was transferred in 1735 to the Renewed Unitas Fratrum by the Unity's two surviving bishops, [[Daniel Ernst Jablonski]] and Christian Sitkovius. The carpenter [[David Nitschmann der Bischof|David Nitschmann]] and, later, Count von Zinzendorf, were the first two bishops of the Renewed Unity.  Moravian historians identify the main achievements of this period as:\n\n# Setting up a watch of [[continual prayer|continuous prayer]] that ran uninterrupted, 24 hours a day, for 100 years.\n# Originating the ''[[Daily Watchwords]]''.\n# Establishing more than 30 settlements internationally on the Herrnhut model, which emphasized prayer and worship, and a form of communal living in which simplicity of lifestyle and generosity with wealth were held to be important spiritual attributes. The purpose of these communities was to assist the members resident there in the sanctification of their lives, to provide a meeting place for Christians from different confessional backgrounds, to provide Christian training for their own children and the children of their friends and supporters and to provide support for the Moravian Mission work throughout the world. As a result, although personal property was held, divisions between social groups and extremes of wealth and poverty were largely eliminated.\n# Being the first Protestant church body to begin missionary work; and\n# Forming many hundreds of small renewal groups operating within the existing churches of Europe, known as \"diaspora societies\". These groups encouraged personal prayer and worship, Bible study, confession of sins and mutual accountability.\n\n===Missions===\n[[File:Group associated with the Moravian Church by Johann Valentin Haidt.jpg|thumb|Portrait of a group of Moravian Church members with King [[George II of Great Britain]], attributed to [[Johann Valentin Haidt]], circa 1752\u20131754]]\nAlong with the [[Royal Danish Mission College]], the Moravian missionaries were the first large-scale [[Mission (Christian)|Protestant missionary movement]]. They sent out the first missionaries when there were only 300 inhabitants in Herrnhut. Within 30 years, the church sent hundreds of Christian missionaries to many parts of the world, including the [[Caribbean]], [[North America|North]] and [[South America]] (see [[Christian Munsee]]), the [[Arctic]], [[Africa]], and the [[Far East]]. They were the first to send lay people (rather than clergy) as missionaries, the first Protestant denomination to minister to slaves, and the first Protestant presence in many countries.\n\nOwing to Zinzendorf's personal contacts with their royalty, the first Moravian missions were directed to the [[Denmark-Norway|Dano-Norwegian Empire]]. While attending the coronation of [[Christian VI of Denmark]], Zinzendorf was profoundly struck by two [[Kalaallit people|Inuit]] converts of [[Hans Egede]]'s [[Kangeq|mission in Greenland]] and also by an African from the [[West Indies]].<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Knight | first1 = C. | title = The Penny Cyclop\u00e6dia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, Volumes 15\u201316 | publisher = C.

For instance, they founded one in 1740 at the Mohican village of ''[[Shekomeko]]'' in present-day [[Dutchess County, New York]]. The converted Mohican people formed the first native Christian congregation in the present-day United States of America. Because of local hostility to the Mohican, the Moravian support of the Mohican led to rumors of their being secret [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]], trying to ally the Mohican with France in the ongoing [[French and Indian Wars]].\n\nAlthough supporters defended their work, at the end of 1744, the colonial government based at [[Poughkeepsie, New York|Poughkeepsie]] expelled the Moravians from New York.<ref>[http://www.usgennet.org/usa/ny/town/pineplains/history.html Philip H.

The mission was established on [[Christmas Eve]], and was named Bethlehem, after the [[Bethlehem|Biblical town in Judea]]. There, they ministered to the Algonquian [[Lenape Nation|Lenape]]. [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania]] is today the seventh largest city in Pennsylvania. In 1772, the first civilized settlement of what later became [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania]] occurred when Reverend John Ettwein, a Moravian missionary, arrived there with a band of 241 Christianized [[Delaware Indians]].<ref name=Guide>''Pennsylvania: A Guide to the Keystone State''.

Google Books, & Amazon Kindle.</ref>\n\nColonies were also founded in North Carolina, where Moravians led by Bishop August Gottlieb Spangenberg purchased 98,985 acres (400.58 km2) from [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville]]. This large tract of land was named ''die [[Wachau]]'', or [[Wachovia, North Carolina|Wachovia]], after one of Zinzendorf's ancestral estates on the [[Danube River]] in [[Lower Austria]]. Other early settlements included Bethabara (1753), Bethania (1759) and Salem (now referred to as [[Old Salem]] in [[Winston-Salem]] North Carolina) (1766).\n\nIn 1801 the Moravians established Springplace mission to the [[Cherokee Nation]] in what is now [[Murray County, Georgia|Murray County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].  Coinciding with the [[Trail of Tears|forced removal]] of the Cherokees to Oklahoma, this mission was replaced in 1842 by New Springplace in [[Oaks, Oklahoma]]. Due to [[American Civil War|Civil War]]-related violence, New Springplace closed in 1862, and resumed during the 1870s. Finally, in 1898, the Moravian Church discontinued their missionary engagement with the Cherokees, and New Springplace, now the Oaks Indian Mission, was transferred to the [[Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church]].<ref name=\"EOHC-Oaks\">[http://www.okhistory.org/publications/enc/entry.php?entry=OA003 Rose Stauber] \"Oaks,\" ''Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture''. Accessed March 26, 2015.</ref>\n\nThe start of far-flung missionary work necessitated the establishment of independently administered provinces. So, from about 1732,<ref name=\"S&H\"/>{{Rp|7}} the history of the church becomes the history of its provinces.\n\nEventually, the Moravian missions in [[Australia]] and [[Greenland]] were transferred to the local Presbyterian and Lutheran Churches respectively.\n\nThe first mission station in present-day [[South Africa]] was established by the Moravian Georg Schmidt at [[Genadendal]] in 1738.  The mission at [[Wupperthal]], established by the [[Rhenish Missionary Society]] was eventually transferred to the Moravian Church.\n\n==Present==\n[[file:Mary Greenwood on gravestones born 1752.jpg|thumb|right|Mary Greenwoord was buried in [[Gracehill]] in [[County Antrim]] in 1752.

In many places it observes the convention of the [[lovefeast]], originally started in 1727. It uses older and traditional music in worship. Brass music, congregational singing and choral music continue to be very important in Moravian congregations. In addition, in some older congregations, Moravians are buried in a traditional [[God's Acre]], a graveyard with only flat gravestones, signifying the equality of the dead before God and organized by sex, age and marital status rather than family.\n\nThe Moravians continue their long tradition of missionary work, for example in the Caribbean, where the Jamaican Moravian Church has begun work in Cuba and in Africa where the Moravian Church in Tanzania has missions in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Uganda. This is reflected in their broad global distribution. The Moravians in Germany, whose central settlement remains at [[Herrnhut]], are highly active in education and social work. The American Moravian Church sponsors the [[Moravian College]] and Seminary. The largest concentration of Moravians today is in [[Tanzania]].\n\nThe motto of the Moravian Church is: \"In essentials, unity; in nonessentials, liberty; and in all things, love\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moravian.org/the-moravian-church/what-moravians-believe-2/|title=What Moravians Believe \u00ab The Moravian Church \u00ab Moravian Church of North America|website=Moravian.org|accessdate=22 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nSome Moravian scholars point to a different formula as a guide to constructive debate about faith. This formula was first advanced by [[Luke of Prague]] (1460\u20131528), one of the bishops of the ancient Unitas Fratrum. Luke taught that one must distinguish between things that are essential, ministerial or incidental to salvation. The essentials are God's work of creation, redemption and sanctification, as well as the response of the believer through faith, hope and love. Things ministerial are such items as the Bible, church, sacraments, doctrine and priesthood. These mediate the sacred and should thus be treated with respect, but they are not considered essential. Finally, incidentals include things such as vestments or names of services that may reasonably vary from place to place\n\n==Organization==\n===Provinces===\nFor its global work, the Church is organised into Unity Provinces, Mission Provinces and Mission Areas and four regions of Africa, Caribbean and Latin America, Northern America, and Europe. The categorisation is based on the level of independence of the Province.

Formerly the West Himalayan Province (1853) and designated a Unity Undertaking in 1967.\n\n[[Tanzania]] is divided into seven provinces because of the size of country and the numbers of people in the church. The \"Moravian Church in Tanzania\" co-ordinates the work in the nation.\n\nThe lists above, except for some details given under 'Other areas', can be found in ''The Moravian Almanac''.<ref name=Almanac>The Moravian Almanac is published annually (October) as a supplement to the devotional book ''Daily Watchwords''. Most Provinces publish their own almanac with details of local congregations and the wider Provinces. Copies may be obtained from the Moravian Church House (office) of any province (for addresses see the provinces pages).</ref>\n\nEach Province is governed by a [[synod]], made up of representatives from each congregation plus ''ex officio'' members.\n\nThe Synod elects the Provincial Board (aka Provincial Elders' Conference or PEC<ref>In Moravian usage, Elder is a title applicable to the members of any church board (conference) whether at provincial or congregational level. The term refers to responsible people who, commanding the respect of their fellow members, have been elected, at provincial level by the Synod, and at local level by the Congregation Council. A Board of Elders always acts collegially, not individually<sup>[7]</sup>.</ref>) to be responsible for the work of the Province and its international links between Synods.\n\n===Districts===\nMany, but not all, of the Provinces are divided into Districts.\n\n===Congregations===\n[[File:Neudietendorf Bruederkirche-Innen1.jpg|thumb|A Moravian church in [[Neudietendorf]] in [[Thuringia]] in Germany]]\n\nEach congregation belongs to a district and has spiritual and financial responsibilities for work in its own area as well as provincially. The Congregation Council (all the members of a congregation) usually meets twice a year and annually elects the Joint Board of Elders and Trustees that acts as an executive.\n\nIn some provinces two or more congregations may be grouped into circuits, under the care of one minister.\n\n===Unity Synod===\nThe Unity Synod meets every seven years and is attended by delegates from the different Unity Provinces and affiliated Provinces.\n\n===Unity Board===\nThe Unity Board is made up of one member from each Provincial Board, and acts as an executive committee between Unity Synods. It meets three times between Synods but much of its work is done by correspondence and postal voting.\n\nThe '''President''' of the Unity Board (who is elected by the Board for two years and not allowed to serve for more than two terms) works from his/her own Provincial office. The '''Unity Business Administrator''' is an officer appointed by the Unity Board to administer the day-to-day affairs of the Unity through the office of the Unity.\n\n==Orders of Ministry==\nOrdained ministry in the Moravian Church emphasizes the pastoral role. A candidate for ministry who has been approved by their home province and has completed the prescribed course of study (usually a Master of Divinity degree in the US and Europe) may be ordained a Deacon upon acceptance of a call. Deacons may serve in a pastoral office and administer sacraments. A deacon is normally supervised by a presbyter who serves as mentor. After several years of satisfactory service, the Deacon may be consecrated as a Presbyter. Presbyters function in the local congregation in the same manner as deacons, but may also\nserve to mentor deacons and may be assigned to other leadership roles in a particular province.\n\nAn Acolyte is a layperson who has received approval to assist the pastor in a specific local congregation. The acolyte may assist in the serving of Holy Communion but may not consecrate the elements.\n\nThe highest order of ministry is that of a bishop. Bishops are elected by Provincial Synods usually through ecclesiastical ballot without nomination. In the Moravian Church, bishops do not have an administrative role but rather serve as spiritual leaders and pastors to the pastors. Bishops serve the worldwide Unity.<ref>\"Church Order of the Unitas Fratrum\", 2009, Chapter XIII.</ref> The Moravian Church is reputed to have received the [[apostolic succession]] through the Waldensian Church, but the historicity of this is disputed.  In Berlin, 1735, the Renewed Unity, i.e. the Moravian Brethren in Herrnhut, received the historic episcopal ordination from the two surviving bishops of the Ancient Unity: Bishop [[John Amos Comenius|John Amos Comenius']] grandson [[Daniel Ernst Jablonski]] and Christian Sitkovius. This bishop's consecration continues today.\n\n==Beliefs==\n\nIn her ''Book of Order''<ref name=UBoO>Church Order of the Unitas Fratrum, published by order of the Unity Synod.</ref><ref name=UBoO-Online>[http://www.unitasfratrum.org/pages/ground_unity.html The Ground of the Unity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122053034/http://www.unitasfratrum.org/pages/ground_unity.html |date=2007-11-22 }}</ref> the several provinces of the Moravian Unity accept:\n*The three [[Ecumenical Creeds]]: [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles']], [[Nicene Creed|Nicene]] and [[Athanasian Creed|Athanasian]]\n*The first 21 articles of the Unaltered [[Augsburg Confession]]\n*The Confession of the Unity of the Bohemian Brethren of 1535\n*The [[Barmen Declaration]] of 1934\n*The [[Small Catechism]] of [[Martin Luther]]\n*The Synod of Berne/''Berner Synodus'' of 1532\n*[[The Thirty-Nine Articles]] of the [[Church of England]]\n*The [[Heidelberg Catechism]]\n\nAccording to the Ground of the Unity<ref name=UBoO/><ref name=UBoO-Online/> of 1957, fundamental beliefs include but are not limited to:\n*The [[Holy Trinity]]: the Father, the Son or Logos/Word, and the Holy Spirit.\n*The Fatherhood of God\n*God's Love for fallen humanity\n*The [[Incarnation]] of God in the God/Man [[Jesus Christ]]\n*Jesus' sacrificial death for the sinful rebellion of humanity\n*Jesus' [[Resurrection]], [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] and Exaltation to the Right Hand of the Father\n*Jesus' sending of the [[Holy Spirit]] to strengthen, sustain and empower believers\n*Jesus' eventual return, in majesty, [[Last Judgment|to judge the living and the dead]]\n*The Kingdom of Christ shall never end\n*There is one [[Baptism]] for the forgiveness of sins.  Rebaptism is not allowed.\n*Infants are baptized most commonly, but all forms of baptism are accepted (infant or adult; pouring, sprinkling or immersion).\n*Moravian doctrine teaches that the Body and Blood of Christ are present in [[Holy Communion]]. Without seeking to explain the \"Mode\" or the \"How\" of the Presence of Jesus' Body and Blood in the Eucharist, they teach a [[sacramental union]] whereby with the Bread and the Wine the Body and Blood are also received.  Individual believers are allowed to believe in other interpretations, however. Cf. the \"Easter Morning Litany\" of the Moravian Church, a statement of faith, in the Moravian Book of Worship, p.&nbsp;85.\n\nThese tenets of classical Christianity are not unique to the Moravian Church. The emphasis in both the Ancient Unity and the Renewed Unity is on Christian living and the fellowship of believers as a true witness to a vibrant Christian Faith.\n\n===Spirit of the Moravian Church===\n\nAn account of the ethos of the Moravian Church is given by one of its British bishops, Clarence H. Shawe.<ref>Rt Revd C H Shawe, DD (1977), ''The Spirit of the Moravian Church'', London, The Moravian Book Room.</ref> In a lecture series delivered at the Moravian Theological Seminary in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, Shawe described the Spirit of the Moravian Church as having five characteristics: simplicity, happiness, unintrusiveness, fellowship, and the ideal of service.\n\n'''''Simplicity''''' is a focus on the essentials of faith and a lack of interest in the niceties of doctrinal definition. Shawe quotes Zinzendorf's remark that \"The Apostles say: 'We believe we have salvation through the grace of Jesus Christ....' If I can only teach a person that catechism I have made him a divinity scholar for all time\" (Shawe, 1977, p.&nbsp;9). From this simplicity flow secondary qualities of genuineness and practicality.\n\n'''''Happiness''''' is the natural and spontaneous response to God's free and gracious gift of salvation. Again Shawe quotes Zinzendorf: \"There is a difference between a genuine Pietist and a genuine Moravian. The Pietist has his sin in the foreground and looks at the wounds of Jesus; the Moravian has the wounds in the forefront and looks from them upon his sin. The Pietist in his timidity is comforted by the wounds; the Moravian in his happiness is shamed by his sin\" (p.&nbsp;13).\n\n'''''Unintrusiveness''''' is based on the Moravian belief that God positively wills the existence of a variety of churches to cater for different spiritual needs. There is no need to win converts from other churches. The source of Christian unity is not legal form but everyone's heart-relationship with the Saviour.\n\n'''''Fellowship''''' is based on this heart-relationship. Shawe says: \"The Moravian ideal has been to gather together kindred hearts.... Where there are 'Christian hearts in love united', there fellowship is possible in spite of differences of intellect and intelligence, of thought, opinion, taste and outlook. ... Fellowship [in Zinzendorf's time] meant not only a bridging of theological differences but also of social differences; the artisan and aristocrat were brought together as brothers and sat as equal members on the same committee\" (pp.&nbsp;21,22).\n\n'''''The ideal of service''''' entails happily having the attitude of a servant. This shows itself partly in faithful service in various roles within congregations but more importantly in service of the world \"by the extension of the Kingdom of God\". Historically, this has been evident in educational and especially missionary work. Shawe remarks that \"none could give themselves more freely to the spread of the gospel than those Moravian emigrants who, by settling in Herrnhut [i.e., on Zinzendorf's estate], had gained release from suppression and persecution\" (p.&nbsp;26).\n\n==Worship==\n\n* [[List of hymnals#Moravian Church|Hymn Books]]\n* Liturgy\n* the Sacrament of the Holy Communion\n* The Sacrament of Baptism, Infants and Adults\n* Marriage\n* Confirmation\n* [[Christian Burial]]\n* Ordination Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons\n* Consecration of church buildings and facilities\n\n==Traditions==\n\n[[File:Lovefeast at Bethania Moravian Church.jpg|thumb|350px|A Moravian [[diener]] serves bread to fellow members of her congregation during the celebration of a [[lovefeast]].]]\n* [[Lovefeast]]\n* Settlements\n* Cup of Covenant\n* [[Christingle]] (object) and Christingle service\n* [[Hosanna#Other examples of modern usage|Hosanna Anthem]]\n* [[Moravian star|Moravian Advent star]]\n* ''[[Daily Watchwords]]'', sometimes called Moravian Daily Texts\n* [[Advent]] Wreath and Candles\n* Passion Week/ [[Holy Week]] Reading Services\n* [[God's Acre]] and [[Easter]] [[sunrise service]]\n* [[Sortition| Drawing of lots]]\n* [[Moravian music|Music]]\n* [[Watch Night]] Service\n* [[Dead house]]\n\n==Former traditions==\n\n* The drawing of \"lots\" in decision making\n* Single Brethren's and Single Sisters' Houses: in the old original Settlement Congregations of Europe, Britain and the US, there were separate Houses caring for the spiritual and also temporal welfare of the Choirs of Single Brethren, Single Sisters, Widows.<ref name=BBoO>''Book of Order, The Moravian Church in Great Britain and Ireland'', 2002.</ref>\n* Wide/Short layout of church interiors\n* Separate seating of sexes in churches\n* Mission ships (the ''Harmony'' and the ''Snow Irene'')\n* Choirs: the word \"Choir\" has been used in the Moravian tradition since the 18th century to indicate a group of congregation members classified according to age and sex.

Most provinces are also members of their national councils of churches, such as the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland (EKD)]] in Germany and the [[National Council of Churches]] of Christ in the US, the all African Council of Churches, the Caribbean Council of Churches, the Jamaica Council of Churches. The American Southern Province was instrumental in the founding the North Carolina Council of Churches. The British Province is of the [[Churches Together in Britain and Ireland]] (formerly the [[British Council of Churches]]) and has an interim Communion agreement with the [[Church of England]]. The two North American provinces are in full communion with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] (ELCA). The Northern Province of the Moravian Church voted June 18, 2010 to enter into full communion with the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]. The Moravian Church's Southern Province also voted to enter into full communion with the Episcopal Church during its synod in September 2010. Each province can independently enter into full communion relationships.<ref>[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/79425_123037_ENG_HTM.htm Episcopal Life Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623001846/http://www.episcopalchurch.org/79425_123037_ENG_HTM.htm |date=2010-06-23 }}</ref> In the 1980s there were discussions in England by which an agreement was created that would have created full communion between the Moravians, [[Presbyterians]], [[Methodists]], and the [[Church of England]]. The Presbyterians and Methodists would have accepted the [[Historic Episcopate]], but since the Moravians already had this, they would have changed nothing. This agreement fell through because the [[General Synod of the Church of England]] did not give approval.\n\nOne aspect of Moravian history and mission is the so-called \"Diaspora\" work in Germany and Eastern Europe, seeking to deepen and encourage the Christian life among members of the territorial churches, particularly in [[Poland]] and the [[Baltic states]], but also throughout the German-speaking lands. Count Zinzendorf's ideal was a fellowship of all Christians, regardless of denominational names, and the Moravian Brethren sought in the Diaspora not to convert people to the Moravian Church but to awaken the hearts of believers and make them better members of the churches to which they already belonged. At first the object of suspicion, in the course of time the Moravian Diaspora workers became valued co-workers in eastern Europe. This Diaspora work suffered almost total destruction in World War II, but is still carried on within the territorial churches of Germany. With the restored independence of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]], it was revealed that much of the Diaspora Work there had been kept alive in spite of domination by the former [[Soviet Union]] and had even borne fruit.\n\n==Historical societies==\n* American North: ''the Moravian Historical Society'' and Historic Bethlehem (Pennsylvania)\n* American South: ''the Wachovia Historical Society'' as well as [[Old Salem]]\n* British: Moravian Church House, London\n* Continental Province ''Verein f\u00fcr Geschichts- und Gegenwartsfragen der Br\u00fcdergemeine''\n* \u201eVia exulantis\", Suchdol nad Odrou (Zauchtenthal or Zauchtel), The Moravian Brethren's Museum.

If he swore not to escape, he could gain better accommodations and the freedom of the prison. If he swore to cease hostilities against the nation who held him captive, he could be repatriated or exchanged but could not serve against his former captors in a military capacity.\n\n===European settlers captured in North America===\n{{further|Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War}}\nEarly historical narratives of captured colonial Europeans, including perspectives of literate women captured by the indigenous peoples of North America, exist in some number. The writings of [[Mary Rowlandson]], captured in the brutal fighting of [[King Philip's War]], are an example. Such narratives enjoyed some popularity, spawning a genre of the [[captivity narrative]], and had lasting influence on the body of early American literature, most notably through the legacy of [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. Some Native Americans continued to capture Europeans and use them both as labourers and bargaining chips into the 19th century; see for example [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] people on the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast from 1802 to 1805.\n\n===French Revolutionary wars and Napoleonic wars===\nThe earliest known purposely built [[prisoner-of-war camp]] was established at [[Norman Cross]], England in 1797 to house the increasing number of prisoners from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The average prison population was about 5,500 men. The lowest number recorded was 3,300 in October 1804 and 6,272 on 10 April 1810 was the highest number of prisoners recorded in any official document. Norman Cross was intended to be a model depot providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war. The British government went to great lengths to provide food of a quality at least equal to that available to locals. The senior officer from each quadrangle was permitted to inspect the food as it was delivered to the prison to ensure it was of sufficient quality. Despite the generous supply and quality of food, some prisoners died of starvation after gambling away their rations. Most of the men held in the prison were low-ranking soldiers and sailors, including midshipmen and junior officers, with a small number of [[privateers]]. About 100 senior officers and some civilians \"of good social standing\", mainly passengers on captured ships and the wives of some officers, were given ''parole d'honneur'' outside the prison, mainly in [[Peterborough]] although some further afield in [[Northampton]], [[Plymouth]], [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]] and [[Abergavenny]]. They were afforded the courtesy of their rank within English society. During the [[Battle of Leipzig]] both sides used the [[Alter Johannisfriedhof|city's cemetery]] as lazaret and prisoner camp for around 6000 POWs who lived in the vaults and used the coffins for firewood. Food was scarce and prisoners resorted to eating horses, cats, dogs or even human flesh. The bad conditions inside the graveyard contributed to a city-wide epidemic after the battle.<ref>https://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb10604517.html?pageNo=305 (german) [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz|Rochlitz]]: ''Collected Works vol 6'' (1822), description of treatment of french prisoners p. 305ff</ref><ref>https://www.leipzig-lese.de/index.php?article_id=393 (german) Gravedigger Ahlemann: witness report about the Leipzig cemetery during the Battle of Leipzig.</ref>\n\n===Prisoner exchanges===\nThe extensive period of conflict during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1793\u20131815), followed by the [[United Kingdom \u2013 United States relations|Anglo-American]] [[War of 1812]], led to the emergence of a [[cartel (ship)|cartel]] system for the [[exchange of prisoners]], even while the belligerents were at war. A cartel was usually arranged by the respective armed service for the exchange of like-ranked personnel. The aim was to achieve a reduction in the number of prisoners held, while at the same time alleviating shortages of skilled personnel in the home country.\n\n===American Civil War===\n{{main|American Civil War prison camps}}\n[[File:Battle of Mine Creek.gif|thumb|[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] prisoners of war on the way to [[Camp Ford]] prison in October 1864.]]\nAt the start of the civil war a system of paroles operated.

Butler contacted Grant for guidance on the issue, and Grant responded to Butler on 18 August 1864 with his now famous statement.

National Geographic News. 1 July 2003.</ref>\n\n===Amelioration===\nDuring the 19th century, there were increased efforts to improve the treatment and processing of prisoners. As a result of these emerging conventions, a number of international conferences were held, starting with the Brussels Conference of 1874, with nations agreeing that it was necessary to prevent inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of weapons causing unnecessary harm. Although no agreements were immediately ratified by the participating nations, work was continued that resulted in new [[treaty|conventions]] being adopted and becoming recognized as [[international law]] that specified that prisoners of war be treated humanely and diplomatically.\n\n===Hague and Geneva Conventions===\nChapter II of the Annex to the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] ''IV \u2013 The Laws and Customs of War on Land'' covered the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. These provisions were further expanded in the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War]] and were largely revised in the [[Third Geneva Convention]] in 1949.\n\nArticle 4 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] protects captured [[military personnel]], some [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighters, and certain [[civilians]]. It applies from the moment a prisoner is captured until he or she is released or repatriated. One of the main provisions of the convention makes it illegal to [[torture]] prisoners and states that a prisoner can only be required to give their [[name]], [[date of birth]], [[Military rank|rank]] and [[service number]] (if applicable).\n\nThe [[ICRC]] has a special role to play, with regards to [[international humanitarian law]], in [[Restoring Family Links|restoring and maintaining family contact in times of war]], in particular concerning the right of prisoners of war and internees to send and receive letters and cards (Geneva Convention (GC) III, art.71 and GC IV, art.107).\n\nHowever, nations vary in their dedication to following these laws, and historically the treatment of POWs has varied greatly. During World War II, [[Imperial Japan]] and [[Nazi Germany]] (towards Soviet POWs and Western Allied commandos) were notorious for atrocities against prisoners of war. The German military used the Soviet Union's refusal to sign the Geneva Convention as a reason for not providing the necessities of life to Soviet POWs; and the Soviets similarly killed Axis prisoners or used them as slave labour. The Germans also routinely executed Western Allied commandos captured behind German lines per the [[Commando Order]]. North Korean and North and South Vietnamese forces<ref name=\"south-viet\">{{cite web|title=In South Vietnamese Jails|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10775|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref> routinely killed or mistreated prisoners taken during those conflicts.\n\n====Qualifications====\n[[File:Japanese Beheading 1894.jpg|thumb|Japanese illustration depicting the beheading of Chinese captives. [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894\u20135.]]\nTo be entitled to prisoner-of-war status, captured persons must be [[lawful combatant]]s entitled to combatant's privilege\u2014which gives them immunity from punishment for crimes constituting lawful acts of war such as killing [[enemy combatant]]s. To qualify under the [[Third Geneva Convention]], a combatant must be part of a [[chain of command]], wear a \"fixed distinctive marking, visible from a distance\", bear arms openly, and have conducted military operations according to the [[laws and customs of war]]. (The Convention recognizes a few other groups as well, such as \"[i]nhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units\".)\n\nThus, uniforms and badges are important in determining prisoner-of-war status under the Third Geneva Convention. Under [[Additional Protocol I]], the requirement of a distinctive marking is no longer included. ''[[francs-tireurs]]'', [[militia]]s, [[insurgent]]s, [[terrorists]], [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], and [[Espionage|spies]] generally do not qualify because they do not fulfill the criteria of Additional Protocol 1. Therefore they fall under the category of [[unlawful combatant]]s, or more properly they are not combatants. Captured soldiers who do not get prisoner of war status are still protected like civilians under the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].\n\nThe criteria are applied primarily to ''international'' armed conflicts. The application of prisoner of war status in non-international armed conflicts like [[civil wars]] is guided by [[Additional Protocol II]], but [[insurgents]] are often treated as [[traitors]], [[terrorist]]s or [[criminals]] by government forces and are sometimes executed on spot or tortured. However, in the [[American Civil War]], both sides treated captured troops as POWs presumably out of [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]], although the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] regarded [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] personnel as separatist rebels. However, guerrillas and other irregular combatants generally cannot expect to receive benefits from both civilian and military status simultaneously.\n\n===Rights===\nUnder the [[Third Geneva Convention]], prisoners of war (POW) must be:\n\n*Treated humanely with respect for their persons and their honor\n*Able to inform their next of kin and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] of their capture\n*Allowed to communicate regularly with relatives and receive packages\n*Given adequate food, clothing, housing, and medical attention\n*Paid for work done and not forced to do work that is dangerous, unhealthy, or degrading\n*Released quickly after conflicts end\n*Not compelled to give any information except for name, age, rank, and service number<ref>{{cite web|title=Geneva Convention|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_geneva_con.html|publisher=Peace Pledge Union|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, if wounded or sick on the battlefield, the prisoner will receive help from the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Story of an idea- the Film|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIwB-Y6FUjY|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhen a country is responsible for breaches of prisoner of war rights, those accountable will be punished accordingly. An example of this is the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo Trials]].

It was created primarily in response to the breakdown of leadership and organization, specifically when U.S. forces were POWs during the [[Korean War]].\n\nWhen a military member is taken prisoner, the Code of Conduct reminds them that the chain of command is still in effect (the highest ranking service member eligible for command, regardless of service branch, is in command), and requires them to support their leadership. The Code of Conduct also requires service members to resist giving information to the enemy (beyond identifying themselves, that is, \"name, rank, serial number\"), receiving special favors or parole, or otherwise providing their enemy captors aid and comfort.\n\nSince the [[Vietnam War]], the official U.S. military term for enemy POWs is EPW (Enemy Prisoner of War).

Bellot, \"Treatment of Prisoners of War\", ''Transactions of the Grotius Society'', Vol. 5, (1919), pp. 47\u201364.</ref> Individual surrenders were uncommon; usually a large unit surrendered all its men. At [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] 92,000 Russians surrendered during the battle. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, 20,000 Russians became prisoners. Over half the Russian losses were prisoners as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed. About 3.3&nbsp;million men became prisoners.<ref>Niall Ferguson, ''The Pity of War.''

The US held 48,000. The most dangerous moment for POWs was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes mistakenly shot down. Once prisoners reached a POW camp conditions were better (and often much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations.\n\nThere was however much harsh treatment of POWs in Germany, as recorded by the American ambassador to Germany (prior to America's entry into the war), James W. Gerard, who published his findings in \"My Four Years in Germany\". Even worse conditions are reported in the book \"Escape of a Princess Pat\" by the Canadian George Pearson. It was particularly bad in Russia, where starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; a quarter of the over 2 million POWs held there died.<ref>\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PP7uMQdgv5AC&pg=PA240&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Disobedience and Conspiracy in the German Army, 1918\u20131945]''\".

[[Australian Flying Corps]] pilots and observers were captured in the Sinai Peninsula, Palestine and the Levant. One third of all Australian prisoners were captured on Gallipoli including the crew of the submarine AE2 which made a passage through the Dardanelles in 1915.

Plans were made for them to be sent via [[Dunkirk]] to [[Dover]] and a large reception camp was established at Dover capable of housing 40,000 men, which could later be used for [[demobilisation]].\n\nOn 13 December 1918, the armistice was extended and the Allies reported that by 9 December 264,000 prisoners had been repatriated. A very large number of these had been released ''en masse'' and sent across Allied lines without any food or shelter. This created difficulties for the receiving Allies and many released prisoners died from exhaustion. The released POWs were met by [[cavalry]] troops and sent back through the lines in lorries to reception centres where they were refitted with boots and clothing and dispatched to the ports in trains.\n\nUpon arrival at the receiving camp the POWs were registered and \"boarded\" before being dispatched to their own homes. All [[commissioned officer]]s had to write a report on the circumstances of their capture and to ensure that they had done all they could to avoid capture.

Some American POWs claimed the Germans were victims of circumstance and did the best they could, while others accused their captors of brutalities and forced labour. In any case, the prison camps were miserable places where food rations were meager and conditions squalid.

Their POWs were housed in three camps, according to their potential usefulness to the North Korean army. Peace camps and reform camps were for POWs that were either sympathetic to the cause or who had valued skills that could be useful in the army and thus these enemy soldiers were indoctrinated and sometimes conscripted into the North Korean army. The regular prisoners of war were usually very poorly treated. POWs in peace camps were reportedly treated with more consideration.<ref name=\"Three\">{{cite web |url=http://www.kpows.com/thechineseconnection.html |title=Chinese operated three types of POW camps for Americans during the Korean War |date=April 1997 |accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, the 1952 Inter-Camp P.O.W.

If he swore not to escape, he could gain better accommodations and the freedom of the prison. If he swore to cease hostilities against the nation who held him captive, he could be repatriated or exchanged but could not serve against his former captors in a military capacity.\n\n===European settlers captured in North America===\n{{further|Prisoners of war in the American Revolutionary War}}\nEarly historical narratives of captured colonial Europeans, including perspectives of literate women captured by the indigenous peoples of North America, exist in some number. The writings of [[Mary Rowlandson]], captured in the brutal fighting of [[King Philip's War]], are an example. Such narratives enjoyed some popularity, spawning a genre of the [[captivity narrative]], and had lasting influence on the body of early American literature, most notably through the legacy of [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s ''[[The Last of the Mohicans]]''. Some Native Americans continued to capture Europeans and use them both as labourers and bargaining chips into the 19th century; see for example [[John R. Jewitt]], an Englishman who wrote a memoir about his years as a captive of the [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nootka]] people on the [[Pacific Northwest]] coast from 1802 to 1805.\n\n===French Revolutionary wars and Napoleonic wars===\nThe earliest known purposely built [[prisoner-of-war camp]] was established at [[Norman Cross]], England in 1797 to house the increasing number of prisoners from the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The average prison population was about 5,500 men. The lowest number recorded was 3,300 in October 1804 and 6,272 on 10 April 1810 was the highest number of prisoners recorded in any official document. Norman Cross was intended to be a model depot providing the most humane treatment of prisoners of war. The British government went to great lengths to provide food of a quality at least equal to that available to locals. The senior officer from each quadrangle was permitted to inspect the food as it was delivered to the prison to ensure it was of sufficient quality. Despite the generous supply and quality of food, some prisoners died of starvation after gambling away their rations. Most of the men held in the prison were low-ranking soldiers and sailors, including midshipmen and junior officers, with a small number of [[privateers]]. About 100 senior officers and some civilians \"of good social standing\", mainly passengers on captured ships and the wives of some officers, were given ''parole d'honneur'' outside the prison, mainly in [[Peterborough]] although some further afield in [[Northampton]], [[Plymouth]], [[Melrose, Scotland|Melrose]] and [[Abergavenny]]. They were afforded the courtesy of their rank within English society. During the [[Battle of Leipzig]] both sides used the [[Alter Johannisfriedhof|city's cemetery]] as lazaret and prisoner camp for around 6000 POWs who lived in the vaults and used the coffins for firewood. Food was scarce and prisoners resorted to eating horses, cats, dogs or even human flesh. The bad conditions inside the graveyard contributed to a city-wide epidemic after the battle.<ref>https://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/goToPage/bsb10604517.html?pageNo=305 (german) [[Johann Friedrich Rochlitz|Rochlitz]]: ''Collected Works vol 6'' (1822), description of treatment of french prisoners p. 305ff</ref><ref>https://www.leipzig-lese.de/index.php?article_id=393 (german) Gravedigger Ahlemann: witness report about the Leipzig cemetery during the Battle of Leipzig.</ref>\n\n===Prisoner exchanges===\nThe extensive period of conflict during the [[American Revolutionary War]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1793\u20131815), followed by the [[United Kingdom \u2013 United States relations|Anglo-American]] [[War of 1812]], led to the emergence of a [[cartel (ship)|cartel]] system for the [[exchange of prisoners]], even while the belligerents were at war. A cartel was usually arranged by the respective armed service for the exchange of like-ranked personnel. The aim was to achieve a reduction in the number of prisoners held, while at the same time alleviating shortages of skilled personnel in the home country.\n\n===American Civil War===\n{{main|American Civil War prison camps}}\n[[File:Battle of Mine Creek.gif|thumb|[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] prisoners of war on the way to [[Camp Ford]] prison in October 1864.]]\nAt the start of the civil war a system of paroles operated.

Butler contacted Grant for guidance on the issue, and Grant responded to Butler on 18 August 1864 with his now famous statement.

As a result of these emerging conventions, a number of international conferences were held, starting with the Brussels Conference of 1874, with nations agreeing that it was necessary to prevent inhumane treatment of prisoners and the use of weapons causing unnecessary harm. Although no agreements were immediately ratified by the participating nations, work was continued that resulted in new [[treaty|conventions]] being adopted and becoming recognized as [[international law]] that specified that prisoners of war be treated humanely and diplomatically.\n\n===Hague and Geneva Conventions===\nChapter II of the Annex to the [[Hague Convention of 1907|1907 Hague Convention]] ''IV \u2013 The Laws and Customs of War on Land'' covered the treatment of prisoners of war in detail. These provisions were further expanded in the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|1929 Geneva Convention on the Prisoners of War]] and were largely revised in the [[Third Geneva Convention]] in 1949.\n\nArticle 4 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] protects captured [[military personnel]], some [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] fighters, and certain [[civilians]]. It applies from the moment a prisoner is captured until he or she is released or repatriated. One of the main provisions of the convention makes it illegal to [[torture]] prisoners and states that a prisoner can only be required to give their [[name]], [[date of birth]], [[Military rank|rank]] and [[service number]] (if applicable).\n\nThe [[ICRC]] has a special role to play, with regards to [[international humanitarian law]], in [[Restoring Family Links|restoring and maintaining family contact in times of war]], in particular concerning the right of prisoners of war and internees to send and receive letters and cards (Geneva Convention (GC) III, art.71 and GC IV, art.107).\n\nHowever, nations vary in their dedication to following these laws, and historically the treatment of POWs has varied greatly. During World War II, [[Imperial Japan]] and [[Nazi Germany]] (towards Soviet POWs and Western Allied commandos) were notorious for atrocities against prisoners of war. The German military used the Soviet Union's refusal to sign the Geneva Convention as a reason for not providing the necessities of life to Soviet POWs; and the Soviets similarly killed Axis prisoners or used them as slave labour. The Germans also routinely executed Western Allied commandos captured behind German lines per the [[Commando Order]]. North Korean and North and South Vietnamese forces<ref name=\"south-viet\">{{cite web|title=In South Vietnamese Jails|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/10775|accessdate=30 November 2009}}</ref> routinely killed or mistreated prisoners taken during those conflicts.\n\n====Qualifications====\n[[File:Japanese Beheading 1894.jpg|thumb|Japanese illustration depicting the beheading of Chinese captives. [[First Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894\u20135.]]\nTo be entitled to prisoner-of-war status, captured persons must be [[lawful combatant]]s entitled to combatant's privilege\u2014which gives them immunity from punishment for crimes constituting lawful acts of war such as killing [[enemy combatant]]s. To qualify under the [[Third Geneva Convention]], a combatant must be part of a [[chain of command]], wear a \"fixed distinctive marking, visible from a distance\", bear arms openly, and have conducted military operations according to the [[laws and customs of war]]. (The Convention recognizes a few other groups as well, such as \"[i]nhabitants of a non-occupied territory, who on the approach of the enemy spontaneously take up arms to resist the invading forces, without having had time to form themselves into regular armed units\".)\n\nThus, uniforms and badges are important in determining prisoner-of-war status under the Third Geneva Convention. Under [[Additional Protocol I]], the requirement of a distinctive marking is no longer included. ''[[francs-tireurs]]'', [[militia]]s, [[insurgent]]s, [[terrorists]], [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[Mercenary|mercenaries]], and [[Espionage|spies]] generally do not qualify because they do not fulfill the criteria of Additional Protocol 1. Therefore they fall under the category of [[unlawful combatant]]s, or more properly they are not combatants. Captured soldiers who do not get prisoner of war status are still protected like civilians under the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]].\n\nThe criteria are applied primarily to ''international'' armed conflicts. The application of prisoner of war status in non-international armed conflicts like [[civil wars]] is guided by [[Additional Protocol II]], but [[insurgents]] are often treated as [[traitors]], [[terrorist]]s or [[criminals]] by government forces and are sometimes executed on spot or tortured. However, in the [[American Civil War]], both sides treated captured troops as POWs presumably out of [[Reciprocity (international relations)|reciprocity]], although the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] regarded [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] personnel as separatist rebels. However, guerrillas and other irregular combatants generally cannot expect to receive benefits from both civilian and military status simultaneously.\n\n===Rights===\nUnder the [[Third Geneva Convention]], prisoners of war (POW) must be:\n\n*Treated humanely with respect for their persons and their honor\n*Able to inform their next of kin and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] of their capture\n*Allowed to communicate regularly with relatives and receive packages\n*Given adequate food, clothing, housing, and medical attention\n*Paid for work done and not forced to do work that is dangerous, unhealthy, or degrading\n*Released quickly after conflicts end\n*Not compelled to give any information except for name, age, rank, and service number<ref>{{cite web|title=Geneva Convention|url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/texts/doc_geneva_con.html|publisher=Peace Pledge Union|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, if wounded or sick on the battlefield, the prisoner will receive help from the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Story of an idea- the Film|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIwB-Y6FUjY|publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhen a country is responsible for breaches of prisoner of war rights, those accountable will be punished accordingly. An example of this is the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]] and [[Tokyo Trials]]. German and Japanese military commanders were prosecuted for preparing and initiating a [[war of aggression]], [[murder]], ill treatment, and [[deportation]] of individuals, and [[genocide]] during World War II.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Penrose|first=Mary Margaret|title=War Crime|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/635621/war-crime/224687/The-Nurnberg-and-Tokyo-trials|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref> Most were executed or sentenced to life in prison for their crimes.\n\n===U.S. Code of Conduct and terminology===\n\n[[The United States Military Code of Conduct]] was promulgated in 1955 via [[s:Executive Order 10631|Executive Order 10631]] under [[U.S. President|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to serve as a moral code for United States service members who have been taken prisoner. It was created primarily in response to the breakdown of leadership and organization, specifically when U.S. forces were POWs during the [[Korean War]].\n\nWhen a military member is taken prisoner, the Code of Conduct reminds them that the chain of command is still in effect (the highest ranking service member eligible for command, regardless of service branch, is in command), and requires them to support their leadership. The Code of Conduct also requires service members to resist giving information to the enemy (beyond identifying themselves, that is, \"name, rank, serial number\"), receiving special favors or parole, or otherwise providing their enemy captors aid and comfort.\n\nSince the [[Vietnam War]], the official U.S. military term for enemy POWs is EPW (Enemy Prisoner of War). This name change was introduced in order to distinguish between enemy and U.S. captives.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/3-19-40/ch1.htm#par2 |title=FM3-19.40 Part 1 Fundamentals of Internment/Resettlement Operations Chptr 1 Introduction |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date=12 August 1949 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7DE1239F93AA25751C0A967958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=War in the Gulf: P.O.W.'s; U.S. Says Prisoners Seem War-Weary | first=Eric | last=Schmitt | date=19 February 1991}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, the U.S. military replaced the designation \"Prisoner of War\" for captured American personnel with \"Missing-Captured\". A January 2008 directive states that the reasoning behind this is since \"Prisoner of War\" is the international legal recognized status for such people there is no need for any individual country to follow suit. This change remains relatively unknown even among experts in the field and \"Prisoner of War\" remains widely used in the Pentagon which has a \"POW/Missing Personnel Office\" and awards the [[Prisoner of War Medal]].<ref name=Missing-Captured>{{cite web|last=Thompson |first=Mark |url=http://battleland.blogs.time.com/2012/05/17/pentagon-we-dont-call-them-pows-anymore/ |title=Pentagon: We Don't Call Them POWs Anymore |work=Time |date=2012-05-17 |accessdate=2014-07-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/130018p.pdf |title=Department of Defense Instruction January 8, 2008 Incorporating Change 1, August 14, 2009 |date= |accessdate=2014-07-28}}</ref>\n\n==World War I==\n{{See also|World War I prisoners of war in Germany}}\n[[File:US pow.jpg|thumb|American prisoners of war in Germany in 1917]]\n[[File:German POWs captured in Flanders by Brits2.jpg|thumb|German soldiers captured by the British in [[Flanders]].]]\n[[File:Type of German prisoners captured in the new push (4688031177).jpg|thumb|German soldier of 120th Infantry Regiment POW 1 January 1918]]\nDuring World War I, about eight million men surrendered and were held in POW camps until the war ended. All nations pledged to follow the Hague rules on fair treatment of prisoners of war, and in general the POWs had a much higher survival rate than their peers who were not captured.<ref>Geo G. Phillimore and Hugh H. L. Bellot, \"Treatment of Prisoners of War\", ''Transactions of the Grotius Society'', Vol. 5, (1919), pp. 47\u201364.</ref> Individual surrenders were uncommon; usually a large unit surrendered all its men. At [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] 92,000 Russians surrendered during the battle. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, 20,000 Russians became prisoners. Over half the Russian losses were prisoners as a proportion of those captured, wounded or killed. About 3.3&nbsp;million men became prisoners.<ref>Niall Ferguson, ''The Pity of War.'' (1999) pp. 368\u201369 for data.</ref>\n\nThe [[German Empire]] held 2.5&nbsp;million prisoners; [[Russian Empire|Russia]] held 2.9&nbsp;million, and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] held about 720,000, mostly gained in the period just before the [[Armistice]] in 1918. The US held 48,000. The most dangerous moment for POWs was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes mistakenly shot down. Once prisoners reached a POW camp conditions were better (and often much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations.\n\nThere was however much harsh treatment of POWs in Germany, as recorded by the American ambassador to Germany (prior to America's entry into the war), James W. Gerard, who published his findings in \"My Four Years in Germany\". Even worse conditions are reported in the book \"Escape of a Princess Pat\" by the Canadian George Pearson. It was particularly bad in Russia, where starvation was common for prisoners and civilians alike; a quarter of the over 2 million POWs held there died.<ref>\"''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PP7uMQdgv5AC&pg=PA240&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false Disobedience and Conspiracy in the German Army, 1918\u20131945]''\".

Some 11,800 British soldiers, most of them Indians, became prisoners after the five-month [[Siege of Kut]], in [[Mesopotamia]], in April 1916.

About 50% of the Australian prisoners were light horsemen including 48 missing believed captured on 1 May 1918 in the Jordan Valley. [[Australian Flying Corps]] pilots and observers were captured in the Sinai Peninsula, Palestine and the Levant. One third of all Australian prisoners were captured on Gallipoli including the crew of the submarine AE2 which made a passage through the Dardanelles in 1915. Forced marches and crowded railway journeys preceded years in camps where disease, poor diet and inadequate medical facilities prevailed. About 25% of other ranks died, many from malnutrition, while only one officer died.<ref>Peter Dennis, [[Jeffrey Grey]], Ewan Morris, Robin Prior with Jean Bou, ''The Oxford Companion to Australian Military History'' (2008) p. 429</ref><ref>H.S.

Plans were made for them to be sent via [[Dunkirk]] to [[Dover]] and a large reception camp was established at Dover capable of housing 40,000 men, which could later be used for [[demobilisation]].\n\nOn 13 December 1918, the armistice was extended and the Allies reported that by 9 December 264,000 prisoners had been repatriated. A very large number of these had been released ''en masse'' and sent across Allied lines without any food or shelter. This created difficulties for the receiving Allies and many released prisoners died from exhaustion. The released POWs were met by [[cavalry]] troops and sent back through the lines in lorries to reception centres where they were refitted with boots and clothing and dispatched to the ports in trains.\n\nUpon arrival at the receiving camp the POWs were registered and \"boarded\" before being dispatched to their own homes. All [[commissioned officer]]s had to write a report on the circumstances of their capture and to ensure that they had done all they could to avoid capture. Each returning officer and man was given a message from King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]], written in his own hand and reproduced on a lithograph.

He couldn't pursue further education after matriculation due to financial difficulties so he started working at [[Hyderabad Allwyn]] for a daily wage of 6 anna (equal to 24 pice).\n\nAnjaiah faced many adversities in his early life which made him a fighter for the cause of social justice.\n\n==Career==\nT.

Anjiah as a leader without followers could evoke unimaginable public sympathy.

They aim to counter a perceived official narrative that women need to be protected. Challenging what they consider to be the CCTV-driven police-security complex, Pinjra Tod demands that concepts of safety and security not be used to silence women's right to mobility and liberation. \n\nThe main specific goals of Pinjra Tod are to end the imposition of curfews on women, to provide affordable accommodation for women, to regularise the situation for paying guests, and to obtain the formation of elected Internal Complaint Committees for prevention, prohibition and redress of sexual harassment in universities.\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 2015, when Delhi's universities reopened after the summer break, [[Jamia Millia Islamia]] issued a notice stating that the female students of the college could no longer request permission to stay out later than 8 pm.

They aim to counter a perceived official narrative that women need to be protected. Challenging what they consider to be the CCTV-driven police-security complex, Pinjra Tod demands that concepts of safety and security not be used to silence women's right to mobility and liberation. \n\nThe main specific goals of Pinjra Tod are to end the imposition of curfews on women, to provide affordable accommodation for women, to regularise the situation for paying guests, and to obtain the formation of elected Internal Complaint Committees for prevention, prohibition and redress of sexual harassment in universities.\n\nIt has been claimed that Pinjra Tod reflects nepotistic tendencies by reiterating the views and perceptions of the elite [[savarna]] group within Indian society<ref>https://livewire.thewire.in/gender-and-sexuality/pinjra-tod-your-time-is-up-why-bahujan-tribal-and-muslim-women-are-quitting-the-collective/</ref> and that it has failed to achieve the reforms it seeks.

The Achaemenid Empire was defeated by [[Alexander the Great]], however following the Alexander's death a number of separate kingdoms were established in [[Anatolia]], including [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], in the corner of the southern Black Sea, ruled by the Persian nobleman [[Mithridates I of Pontus|Mithridates I]].

The former southern provinces of Colchis were reorganized into the [[Roman province]] of [[Pontus (region)|Pontus Polemoniacus]], while the northern Cholchis became the Roman province of [[Georgia in the Roman era|Lazicum]].

The bishops of the [[Exarchate of Lazica|Lazica]] appointed their priests, seeing they are Christians.\n[[File:Map_of_the_Caucasus,_740_CE.svg|thumb|Map of the Caucasus, {{circa|740 AD}}]]\nFrom 542 to 562, Lazica was a scene of the protracted rivalry between the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid]] empires, culminating in the [[Lazic War]], where 1,000 Tzanni auxiliaries under [[Dagisthaeus]] participated. Emperor [[Heraclius]]'s offensive in 628 AD brought victory over the Persians and ensured Roman predominance in Lazica until the invasion and conquest of the Caucasus by the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Arabs]] in the second half of the seventh century. As the result of Muslim invasions, the ancient [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolis]], [[Phasis (titular see)|Phasis]], was lost and Trebizond became the new Metropolitan bishop of Lazica, since then the name Lazi appears the general Greek name for Tzanni. According to Geography of [[Anania Shirakatsi]] of the 7th century,<ref>Ashkharatsuyts, Long Recension, V, 19.</ref> Colchis (''Yeger'' in Armenian sources, same as Lazica) was subdivided into four small districts, one of them being Tzanica, that is [[Chaldia]], and mentions Athinae, Rhizus and Trebizond among its cities. From the second half of the eight century the Trebizond area is referred to in Greek sources (namely of [[Epiphanius of Constantinople]]) as Lazica. The 10th-century Arab geographer [[Abu'l-Fida|Abul Feda]] regards city of Trebizond as being largely a Lazian port.\n\nIn 780, [[kingdom of Abkhazia]] incorporated the former territories of Lazica via a dynastic succession, thus ousting the Pontic Lazs (formerly known as Tzanni) from western Georgia; thereafter, the Tzanni lived under nominal Byzantine suzerainty in the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|theme]] of Chaldia, with its capital at Trebizond, governed by the native semi-autonomous rulers, like the [[Gabras]] family,<ref name=\"Hewsen47\">Hewsen, 47</ref> of possibly \"Greco-Laz\" or simply [[Chalybes|Chaldian]] origin.<ref>A.

The Achaemenid Empire was defeated by [[Alexander the Great]], however following the Alexander's death a number of separate kingdoms were established in [[Anatolia]], including [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]], in the corner of the southern Black Sea, ruled by the Persian nobleman [[Mithridates I of Pontus|Mithridates I]].

Emperor [[Heraclius]]'s offensive in 628 AD brought victory over the Persians and ensured Roman predominance in Lazica until the invasion and conquest of the Caucasus by the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Arabs]] in the second half of the seventh century. As the result of Muslim invasions, the ancient [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolis]], [[Phasis (titular see)|Phasis]], was lost and Trebizond became the new Metropolitan bishop of Lazica, since then the name Lazi appears the general Greek name for Tzanni.

Brill, 2010.,</ref> At the same time, in Turkey, the term Laz is a 'folk' definition for people of different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds originating from the [[Black Sea Region]]. Officially, the Laz people are not recognized as a minority. Thus, many Turks do not even know about their diverse existence and falsely call the inhabitants of the Black Sea coast as the \"Lazlar\". Within the last decade more and more intellectual Laz people realized that the disappearance of their language would lead to the disappearance of their identity and tried to preserve their inherited culture through political empowerment, linguistic education, and music and poetry.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://lazkulturdernegi.org.tr Laz Culture Association] (Turkish)\n* [http://www.lazca.org Lazca.org: Culture, News and Information] (Turkish)\n* [http://www.lazebura.com Lazebura.com: Culture, News and Information] (Turkish)\n* [http://www.lazuri.com Lazuri.com: Culture Portal] (Turkish)\n\n[[Category:Laz people| ]]\n", "name_user": "77.22.179.19", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eSelf-identification)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Laz_people"}
