Originally a modified version of the Firestreak, Red Top emerged as a much more capable weapon, with roughly double the range, a more sensitive seeker giving limited all-aspect capability, and an even larger warhead than the already-large one in Firestreak. Although much more powerful than Firestreak, both missiles remained in service until 1988 when the last of the [[English Electric Lightning]]s retired.\n\n==Development==\n===Improved Blue Jay===\nEven before the original [[de Havilland Firestreak|Firestreak]] entered service, improvements were being studied to increase its performance. Still known by its [[rainbow code]] \"Blue Jay\", Blue Jay Mk. II introduced an improved seeker and more powerful motor, while Mk.

De Havilland responded with Blue Jay Mk. IV, which was later given its own rainbow code, '''Blue Vesta'''.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}\n\nBlue Vesta adopted the PbTe seeker of Mk. II, further improved by cooling it to improve its sensitivity in what became known as the \"Violet Banner\" seeker. The motor was further upgraded to the new Magpie III. To handle the aerodynamic heating issues, the fins were made of steel rather than aluminum, and featured cut-away sections to keep the rear portions of the surfaces out of the Mach cones, a feature they referred to as \"mach tips\".{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=36}}{{efn|More widely known today as a cropped delta.}}\n\nWork on Blue Vesta was curtailed after 1956 as the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) concluded that the rapid closing speeds of two Mach 2+ aircraft would be so quick that the missile would have no chance to be launched while it was still within the range of its seeker.

Lower launch speeds allowed the steel wings and fins to be replaced, and these were enlarged to provide more maneuvering power. The fuselage was straightened, removing the boat-tail design of the Firestreak and allowing the new \"Linnet\" rocket motor to more completely fill the increased volume. Other oddities of the Firestreak, like the fin actuators being in the nose and requiring pushrods running the length of the fuselage were removed, giving it a much more logical layout and further increasing internal volume.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=40}}\n\nThe all-aspect [[lead telluride]] (PbTe) seeker developed for Blue Vesta was replaced by a much less expensive [[indium antimonide]] (InSb) system known as \"Violet Banner\". This seeker lacked the sensitivity of the PbTe model and did not offer true all-aspect capability, but it offset this loss to some degree through a greatly increased the [[field of view]] to 60&nbsp;degrees. Firestreak's tube-powered electronics were replaced by [[transistor]]ized versions, which greatly improved reliability and eliminated the need for continual cooling. The new \"Green Garland\" IR [[proximity fuse]] required only one row of \"windows\", further simplifying the layout.{{sfn|Gibson|Buttler|2007|p=41}}\n\nThese changes allowed the warhead to be moved to the forward fuselage from its former rear-mounted location.

It was twice altered in the next few decades: a three-light [[Tracery#Plate tracery|plate tracery]] window was inserted in its north wall in the mid-13th century and the five-light east window with geometrical tracery was inserted in about 1280. Whatever lancet windows may have been in the [[chancel]] south wall were replaced with three two-light [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic]] windows with reticulated tracery, and a double [[piscina]] was added at the same time.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=806}}\n\nThe [[transept]]s and tower arches are also early 13th century.{{sfn|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|pp=806\u2013807}} The [[nave]] has five-[[Bay (architecture)|bay]] north and south [[Aisle#Architecture|aisles]] whose [[Arcade (architecture)|arcades]] were built in about 1260.

[[Sustrans]] was allowed to re-use the former trackbed to create the [[Phoenix Trail]] which is part of [[National Cycle Network]] route 57. Reopening the rail line through Thame was an option considered by Chiltern Railways in their plan to open a direct rail route from London Marylebone to Oxford via Princes Risborough in 2015. The cost of reinstating bridges was considered prohibitive.\n\n[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] used Thame many times as a location for the ''[[Midsomer Murders]]'' drama series, representing the fictional town of Causton.<ref>{{cite web |title=Finding Causton |url= http://www.visitmidsomer.com/finding-causton/ |website=Visit Midsomer |accessdate=16 May 2018 |date=9 May 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nThe town's two largest employers, [[CPM Group]] and [[Travelodge UK|Travelodge]], both have their head offices on the edge of the town.

On their sides, the cars had two mylar curtain [[Destination sign|rollsigns]], one above a window next to the doors on each end (while the other car classes have a single [[Flip-disc display|flip-dot]] or LED sign above a window next to the center doors). Second, the bulkheads on each end of the 1000-series cars feature windows that extend to the top of the bulkhead frame, whereas other car classes' bulkhead windows only extend slightly higher than the side windows. These cars were the only cars to have curtain rollsigns until about late 1984 as the system grew and they became a liability. During rehabilitation of these cars in 1993, an exterior [[loudspeaker]] was added in place of where one of the rollsigns used to be. The cars also received General Electric [[alternating current|AC]] propulsion (same as that of the [[Breda A650|AnsaldoBreda A650]] railcar used on [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|LA Metro]]), replacing the original Westinghouse cam control DC propulsion systems, making them the first cars on the system to use such propulsion systems.\n\nAlongside with the only ones with rollsigns, the 1000 Series cars are the only cars to have more seating capacity as the other cars, carrying 82 seats. The original interiors had a white grained appearance with 82 orange and brown seats. Although it does have the standing capacity of 175 passengers, the same amount on its successors, until the arrival of the 7000 Series cars, which increased the standing capacity.\n\nAround August 2008, Metrorail tested new overhead handles of different styles on 1122, 1123, 1126, 1127, as well as some 3000-series cars to gauge public opinion.<ref name=\"handles\">{{Cite press release |title=Metro testing new overhead handles inside Metrorail cars |date=August 21, 2008 |publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority |url=http://www.wmata.com/about/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2234 |access-date=August 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Incidents ===\nCar 1076 was taken out of service after its mate was destroyed in the 2004 accident at the {{wmata|Woodley Park}} station.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/washdc/ |title=Washington, D.C. |last=Whitehorne |first=Wayne |last2=Mark Greenwald |publisher=nycsubway.org |access-date=January 21, 2008}}</ref> Car 1028, separated from its mate after it was destroyed during the {{wmata|Federal Triangle}} derailment in 1982, became the [[clearance car|feeler car]] (a car that checks system clearances) and was retired in April 2016. 1079<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Tuesday Red Line service altered as a result of Monday collision |date=June 23, 2009 |publisher=[[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2624 |access-date=August 3, 2010}}</ref> was the lead car on the second train involved in the [[June 2009 Washington Metro train collision|June 22, 2009, Washington Metro train collision]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2009/06/22/old-questions-about-crashworthiness-of-metro-cars/#more-25361 |title=Old Questions About Crashworthiness of Metro Cars \u2013 City Desk |last=DeBonis |first=Mike |date=June 22, 2009 |newspaper=Washington City Paper |access-date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the June 22, 2009, collision, Metro implemented a policy of no longer placing 1000-series railcar pairs at the ends of trains in order to prevent telescoping in a collision, as they were the weakest rolling stock, structurally.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/dc-streetcar-opening-still-months-away-but-plans-develop-for-next-phase-in-anacostia/2014/05/06/4f3f3cb4-d223-11e3-a6b1-45c4dffb85a6_story.html|title=D.C. streetcar opening still months away, but plans develop for next phase in Anacostia|last=Thomson|first=Robert|date=May 7, 2014|access-date=May 8, 2014|publisher=WashPost}}</ref> The new policy placed 1000-series cars in the center of six and eight-car trains, with rail cars of other series in the end positions.\n\n=== Retirement ===\nThe 7000-series cars started replacing these cars starting in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/board/meetings/board-pdfs/upload/4A-Railcar-Program-Update.pdf |title=Customer Service and Operations Committee Board Information Item IV-A, 7000 Series Railcar Update |date=July 13, 2017 |website=WMATA |access-date=May 8, 2018}}</ref> In July 2015, Metro released a request for proposals seeking a contractor to pick-up and dispose of Metro's entire remaining fleet of 1000-series railcars.<ref name=\"dispose 1000\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wmata.com/business/procurement/solicitations/Solicitation-Details.cfm?solicitation_id=3348 |title=Solicitation Details: Pick-Up & Disposal Services for 1000 & 4000 Series Railcars |date=July 23, 2015 |publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority}}</ref> Metro announced on June 7, 2017, that the 1000-series cars will be fully retired and removed from service on July 1, 2017, after running for 41 years.<ref name=\"retire July 2017\" /> On October 27, 2017, WMATA announced on its Twitter account that the last of the cars had been sent off property.<ref name=\"twitter 1000\" />\n\nWMATA retained pair 1000\u20131001 as historical cars.<ref name=\"retire July 2017\" />\n\n=== Other uses ===\nFour cars, formerly numbered 1010\u20131011 and 1044\u20131045, were renumbered to 8000\u20138003 and serve as the \"[[money train]]\" to collect the revenue from station fare card machines.

In place of the second rollsign, these cars are also the first cars to feature an exterior [[loudspeaker]], as the 1000 Series cars lacked on loudspeakers, until it was rehabbed in 1993. The bulkhead on these cars were slightly higher than the 1000 series cars, and also have the flip-dot destination signs. Unlike the 1000 Series, there is less seating in the 2000 Series, by having 14 fewer seats, although retaining the same amount of standing area capacity. In 2002, as part of the rehabilitation project, the 2000 Series cars received new [[Alternating current|AC]] propulsion systems with [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor|IGBT technology]], replacing the original [[cam]]-controlled [[direct current|DC]] propulsion systems. Also included were railcar monitoring systems, advanced [[Automatic train control|ATC]]/[[automatic train stop|ATS]] control systems, exterior [[light-emitting diode|LED]] destination signs, interior LED next stop signs and improved [[emergency exit]] signage.\n\nThe refurbished railcars also received the red, white and blue interior found on the 5000-series cars.\n\n=== Other uses ===\nCars 2016\u20132017 have been removed from service with their seats and carpet removed and are being converted into [[money train]] pairs that will replace the 1000 series running the route.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/971803066249709/permalink/1729061430523865/ |title=2016\u20132017 had their seats removed |first=Arnold |last=Benjamin |publisher=Facebook: Friends of the 1000 Series public group |date=July 2, 2018 |access-date=July 15, 2018 }}</ref>{{sps|date=July 2018}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== 3000-series ==\n{{Infobox train\n| background       = \n| name             = Washington Metro 3000 series\n| image            = File:WMATA Rehab Breda 3000 Series at Reagan National Airport.jpg\n| imagealt         = \n| caption          = Breda cars at Reagan National Airport in 2019\n| interiorimage    = WMATA Breda 3267 interior.jpg\n| interiorimagealt = \n| interiorcaption  = Interior of Breda 3267 prior to rehabilitation\n| service          = 1987\u2013present\n| manufacturer     = Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie (now [[Hitachi Rail Italy]])\n| factory          = [[Pistoia, Italy]]\n| family           = \n| replaced         = \n| yearconstruction = 1984\u20131988<ref name=\"Railcar Programs Progress Update\" />\n| yearservice      = 1987\n| refurbishment    = 2004\u20132009 by [[Alstom|Alstom Transportation]]\n| yearscrapped     = est. 2023\n| numberconstruction= \n| numberbuilt      = 290\n| numberservice    = 282<ref name=\"fy20 proposed budget\" />\n| numberpreserved  = \n| numberscrapped   = \n| formation        = \n| diagram          = \n| code             = \n| fleetnumbers     = 3000\u20133289\n| capacity         = '''Seating''': 68 <br> '''Total:''' 175\n| operator         = [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]]\n| depots           = \n| lines            = [[File:WMATA Blue.svg|20px]] [[File:WMATA Orange.svg|20px]] [[File:WMATA Silver.svg|20px]] [[File:WMATA Green.svg|20px]] [[File:WMATA Yellow.svg|20px]]\n| carbody          = [[Extruded]] [[Aluminum]]\n| trainlength      = {{convert|600|ft|m|2}} (8-car train)\n| carlength        = {{convert|75|ft|m|2}}\n| width            = {{convert|10|ft|1+3/4|in|m|2}}\n| height           = {{convert|10|ft|10|in|m|2}}\n| floorheight      = {{convert|40|in|0}}\n| platformheight   = \n| entrylevelorstep = \n| doors            = Sliding, 6 per car\n| art-sections     = \n| wheeldiameter    = \n| wheelbase        = \n| maxspeed         = {{convert|75|mph|km/h}}\n| weight           =\n| axleload         =   \n| traction         = Four Alstom ONIX 2000 AC Traction Drives (Model 4 EXA 2122)<ref name=\"alstom\" /> with IGBT Inverters (post rehab)<ref name=\"ONIX\" />\n| engine           =\n| enginetype       =\n| cylindercount    = \n| cylindersize     = \n| traction motors  = \n| poweroutput      = {{convert|165|kW|hp|abbr=off}} per motor <br> {{convert|600|kW|hp|abbr=off}} per car\n| tractiveeffort   = \n| transmission     = \n| acceleration     = {{convert|2.8|mph/s|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"dimensions\" />\n| deceleration     = \n| aux              = \n| powersupply      = \n| hvac             = \n| electricsystem   = 750 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]] [[third rail]]\n| collectionmethod = [[Contact shoe]]\n| uicclass         = \n| aarwheels        = \n| bogies           = [[Prefabrication|Fabricated]] [[Steel]]\n| brakes           = \n| safety           = \n| coupling         = \n| multipleworking  = \n| gauge            ={{Track gauge|4ft8.25in}}\n| notes            =\n}}\n[[File:Breda 3283 with modified seating.jpg|thumb|left|Breda 3283 with modified floor plan.

The bulkhead doors have rounded windows compared to squared and a revised operator window design eliminates the top horizontal bar. These stylistic features are similar to what is found on the Rohr 1000-series cars. A major change that occurred for the first time since the Breda 2000-series cars is the reduction of seating. The 6000-series cars seat 64 instead of 68.\n\nThe interior has been completely redesigned to allow for additional standing room (mostly around the center doors) and easier access to all portions of the car. New to the 6000-series cars is the addition of two interior LED next stop indicators located at the center of the car, which brings the total to four interior displays per car (two facing each direction). Also new is an intercom located next to the center doors; previous rail cars only have them at the front and back of each car.\n\nAnother new feature is that they are the first series of cars manufactured with the flashing brake indicators on the far ends of each car. These are similar to what is used on the Rohr cars and the rehabilitated Bredas, indicating when the train is in the final stages of stopping. Mechanically, the 6000-series cars features the same cast trucks as the CAF cars, and use the same propulsion systems and advanced cab signaling systems found in the Breda 2000/3000-series rehabilitation from Alstom.\n\nThe body shells of the 6000-series were built in Barcelona, Spain, with assembly completed in Hornell, New York.<ref name=\"new 6000\">{{Cite press release |title=Metro Unveils New 6000 Series Train On Green Line |date=October 3, 2006 |publisher=[[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] |url=https://wmata.com/about/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=3889 |access-date=January 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Delivery ===\nThe first 6000-series set was placed into service on Friday, October 6, 2006, at 11:30 am on its inaugural trip from {{wmata|Greenbelt}} to {{wmata|Branch Avenue}}.<ref name=\"new 6000\" />\n\nOn November 17, 2008, Metro completed the installation of new stainless steel-grab bars to all 184 6000-series cars.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=Spring-loaded overhead handles installed on series 6000 Metrorail fleet|date=November 17, 2008|publisher=[[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]]|url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2346|access-date=December 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Pilot programs ===\nIn 2007, Metro began testing new resilient flooring on four 6000-series cars (6104+6105, 6142+6143),<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Metro tests new railcar designs |date=December 4, 2007 |publisher=[[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1883 |access-date=November 13, 2014}}</ref> and they announced in November 2013 that within two years, all 5000 and 6000-series cars would feature the new flooring.<ref name=\"carpet\" />\n\nMetro tested new fabric seating on cars 6026\u20136027.

If the pilot program goes well, the remaining cars will be given the new look. WMATA says repainting would cost $14,055 per car, while implementing a vinyl wrap costs only $4,776.

The \"B\" cars can be operated however using smaller [[hostler (rail)|hostler]] controls instead. The married pairs are composed of one of each type. This arrangement favors four- and eight-car trains in A&ndash;B&ndash;B&ndash;A and A&ndash;B&ndash;B&ndash;A&ndash;A&ndash;B&ndash;B&ndash;A configurations, but six-car trains in A&ndash;B&ndash;B&ndash;A&ndash;B&ndash;A and trains in any configuration are also possible.

On their sides, the cars had two mylar curtain [[Destination sign|rollsigns]], one above a window next to the doors on each end (while the other car classes have a single [[Flip-disc display|flip-dot]] or LED sign above a window next to the center doors). Second, the bulkheads on each end of the 1000-series cars feature windows that extend to the top of the bulkhead frame, whereas other car classes' bulkhead windows only extend slightly higher than the side windows. These cars were the only cars to have curtain rollsigns until about late 1984 as the system grew and they became a liability. During rehabilitation of these cars in 1993, an exterior [[loudspeaker]] was added in place of where one of the rollsigns used to be. The cars also received General Electric [[alternating current|AC]] propulsion (same as that of the [[Breda A650|AnsaldoBreda A650]] railcar used on [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority|LA Metro]]), replacing the original Westinghouse cam control DC propulsion systems, making them the first cars on the system to use such propulsion systems.\n\nAlongside with the only ones with rollsigns, the 1000 Series cars are the only cars to have more seating capacity as the other cars, carrying 82 seats. The original interiors had a white grained appearance with 82 orange and brown seats. Although it does have the standing capacity of 175 passengers, the same amount on its successors, until the arrival of the 7000 Series cars, which increased the standing capacity.\n\nAround August 2008, Metrorail tested new overhead handles of different styles on 1122, 1123, 1126, 1127, as well as some 3000-series cars to gauge public opinion.<ref name=\"handles\">{{Cite press release |title=Metro testing new overhead handles inside Metrorail cars |date=August 21, 2008 |publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority |url=http://www.wmata.com/about/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2234 |access-date=August 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\n=== Incidents ===\nCar 1076 was taken out of service after its mate was destroyed in the 2004 accident at the {{wmata|Woodley Park}} station.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://world.nycsubway.org/us/washdc/ |title=Washington, D.C. |last=Whitehorne |first=Wayne |last2=Mark Greenwald |publisher=nycsubway.org |access-date=January 21, 2008}}</ref> Car 1028, separated from its mate after it was destroyed during the {{wmata|Federal Triangle}} derailment in 1982, became the [[clearance car|feeler car]] (a car that checks system clearances) and was retired in April 2016. 1079<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Tuesday Red Line service altered as a result of Monday collision |date=June 23, 2009 |publisher=[[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2624 |access-date=August 3, 2010}}</ref> was the lead car on the second train involved in the [[June 2009 Washington Metro train collision|June 22, 2009, Washington Metro train collision]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2009/06/22/old-questions-about-crashworthiness-of-metro-cars/#more-25361 |title=Old Questions About Crashworthiness of Metro Cars \u2013 City Desk |last=DeBonis |first=Mike |date=June 22, 2009 |newspaper=Washington City Paper |access-date=June 23, 2009}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the June 22, 2009, collision, Metro implemented a policy of no longer placing 1000-series railcar pairs at the ends of trains in order to prevent telescoping in a collision, as they were the weakest rolling stock, structurally.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/dc-streetcar-opening-still-months-away-but-plans-develop-for-next-phase-in-anacostia/2014/05/06/4f3f3cb4-d223-11e3-a6b1-45c4dffb85a6_story.html|title=D.C. streetcar opening still months away, but plans develop for next phase in Anacostia|last=Thomson|first=Robert|date=May 7, 2014|access-date=May 8, 2014|publisher=WashPost}}</ref> The new policy placed 1000-series cars in the center of six and eight-car trains, with rail cars of other series in the end positions.\n\n=== Retirement ===\nThe 7000-series cars started replacing these cars starting in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/board/meetings/board-pdfs/upload/4A-Railcar-Program-Update.pdf |title=Customer Service and Operations Committee Board Information Item IV-A, 7000 Series Railcar Update |date=July 13, 2017 |website=WMATA |access-date=May 8, 2018}}</ref> In July 2015, Metro released a request for proposals seeking a contractor to pick-up and dispose of Metro's entire remaining fleet of 1000-series railcars.<ref name=\"dispose 1000\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wmata.com/business/procurement/solicitations/Solicitation-Details.cfm?solicitation_id=3348 |title=Solicitation Details: Pick-Up & Disposal Services for 1000 & 4000 Series Railcars |date=July 23, 2015 |publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority}}</ref> Metro announced on June 7, 2017, that the 1000-series cars will be fully retired and removed from service on July 1, 2017, after running for 41 years.<ref name=\"retire July 2017\" /> On October 27, 2017, WMATA announced on its Twitter account that the last of the cars had been sent off property.<ref name=\"twitter 1000\" />\n\nWMATA retained pair 1000\u20131001 as historical cars.<ref name=\"retire July 2017\" />\n\n=== Other uses ===\nFour cars, formerly numbered 1010\u20131011 and 1044\u20131045, were renumbered to 8000\u20138003 and serve as the \"[[money train]]\" to collect the revenue from station fare card machines.

In place of the second rollsign, these cars are also the first cars to feature an exterior [[loudspeaker]], as the 1000 Series cars lacked on loudspeakers, until it was rehabbed in 1993. The bulkhead on these cars were slightly higher than the 1000 series cars, and also have the flip-dot destination signs. Unlike the 1000 Series, there is less seating in the 2000 Series, by having 14 fewer seats, although retaining the same amount of standing area capacity. In 2002, as part of the rehabilitation project, the 2000 Series cars received new [[Alternating current|AC]] propulsion systems with [[Insulated-gate bipolar transistor|IGBT technology]], replacing the original [[cam]]-controlled [[direct current|DC]] propulsion systems. Also included were railcar monitoring systems, advanced [[Automatic train control|ATC]]/[[automatic train stop|ATS]] control systems, exterior [[light-emitting diode|LED]] destination signs, interior LED next stop signs and improved [[emergency exit]] signage.\n\nThe refurbished railcars also received the red, white and blue interior found on the 5000-series cars.\n\n=== Other uses ===\nCars 2016\u20132017 have been removed from service with their seats and carpet removed and are being converted into [[money train]] pairs that will replace the 1000 series running the route.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/971803066249709/permalink/1729061430523865/ |title=2016\u20132017 had their seats removed |first=Arnold |last=Benjamin |publisher=Facebook: Friends of the 1000 Series public group |date=July 2, 2018 |access-date=July 15, 2018 }}</ref>{{sps|date=July 2018}}\n{{Clear}}\n\n== 3000-series ==\n{{Infobox train\n| background       = \n| name             = Washington Metro 3000 series\n| image            = File:WMATA Rehab Breda 3000 Series at Reagan National Airport.jpg\n| imagealt         = \n| caption          = Breda cars at Reagan National Airport in 2019\n| interiorimage    = WMATA Breda 3267 interior.jpg\n| interiorimagealt = \n| interiorcaption  = Interior of Breda 3267 prior to rehabilitation\n| service          = 1987\u2013present\n| manufacturer     = Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie (now [[Hitachi Rail Italy]])\n| factory          = [[Pistoia, Italy]]\n| family           = \n| replaced         = \n| yearconstruction = 1984\u20131988<ref name=\"Railcar Programs Progress Update\" />\n| yearservice      = 1987\n| refurbishment    = 2004\u20132009 by [[Alstom|Alstom Transportation]]\n| yearscrapped     = est. 2023\n| numberconstruction= \n| numberbuilt      = 290\n| numberservice    = 282<ref name=\"fy20 proposed budget\" />\n| numberpreserved  = \n| numberscrapped   = \n| formation        = \n| diagram          = \n| code             = \n| fleetnumbers     = 3000\u20133289\n| capacity         = '''Seating''': 68 <br> '''Total:''' 175\n| operator         = [[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]]\n| depots           = \n| lines            = [[File:WMATA Blue.svg|20px]] [[File:WMATA Orange.svg|20px]] [[File:WMATA Silver.svg|20px]] [[File:WMATA Green.svg|20px]] [[File:WMATA Yellow.svg|20px]]\n| carbody          = [[Extruded]] [[Aluminum]]\n| trainlength      = {{convert|600|ft|m|2}} (8-car train)\n| carlength        = {{convert|75|ft|m|2}}\n| width            = {{convert|10|ft|1+3/4|in|m|2}}\n| height           = {{convert|10|ft|10|in|m|2}}\n| floorheight      = {{convert|40|in|0}}\n| platformheight   = \n| entrylevelorstep = \n| doors            = Sliding, 6 per car\n| art-sections     = \n| wheeldiameter    = \n| wheelbase        = \n| maxspeed         = {{convert|75|mph|km/h}}\n| weight           =\n| axleload         =   \n| traction         = Four Alstom ONIX 2000 AC Traction Drives (Model 4 EXA 2122)<ref name=\"alstom\" /> with IGBT Inverters (post rehab)<ref name=\"ONIX\" />\n| engine           =\n| enginetype       =\n| cylindercount    = \n| cylindersize     = \n| traction motors  = \n| poweroutput      = {{convert|165|kW|hp|abbr=off}} per motor <br> {{convert|600|kW|hp|abbr=off}} per car\n| tractiveeffort   = \n| transmission     = \n| acceleration     = {{convert|2.8|mph/s|abbr=on}}<ref name=\"dimensions\" />\n| deceleration     = \n| aux              = \n| powersupply      = \n| hvac             = \n| electricsystem   = 750 [[Volt|V]] [[Direct current|DC]] [[third rail]]\n| collectionmethod = [[Contact shoe]]\n| uicclass         = \n| aarwheels        = \n| bogies           = [[Prefabrication|Fabricated]] [[Steel]]\n| brakes           = \n| safety           = \n| coupling         = \n| multipleworking  = \n| gauge            ={{Track gauge|4ft8.25in}}\n| notes            =\n}}\n[[File:Breda 3283 with modified seating.jpg|thumb|left|Breda 3283 with modified floor plan.

The bulkhead doors have rounded windows compared to squared and a revised operator window design eliminates the top horizontal bar. These stylistic features are similar to what is found on the Rohr 1000-series cars. A major change that occurred for the first time since the Breda 2000-series cars is the reduction of seating. The 6000-series cars seat 64 instead of 68.\n\nThe interior has been completely redesigned to allow for additional standing room (mostly around the center doors) and easier access to all portions of the car. New to the 6000-series cars is the addition of two interior LED next stop indicators located at the center of the car, which brings the total to four interior displays per car (two facing each direction). Also new is an intercom located next to the center doors; previous rail cars only have them at the front and back of each car.\n\nAnother new feature is that they are the first series of cars manufactured with the flashing brake indicators on the far ends of each car. These are similar to what is used on the Rohr cars and the rehabilitated Bredas, indicating when the train is in the final stages of stopping. Mechanically, the 6000-series cars features the same cast trucks as the CAF cars, and use the same propulsion systems and advanced cab signaling systems found in the Breda 2000/3000-series rehabilitation from Alstom.\n\nThe body shells of the 6000-series were built in Barcelona, Spain, with assembly completed in Hornell, New York.<ref name=\"new 6000\">{{Cite press release |title=Metro Unveils New 6000 Series Train On Green Line |date=October 3, 2006 |publisher=[[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] |url=https://wmata.com/about/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=3889 |access-date=January 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Delivery ===\nThe first 6000-series set was placed into service on Friday, October 6, 2006, at 11:30 am on its inaugural trip from {{wmata|Greenbelt}} to {{wmata|Branch Avenue}}.<ref name=\"new 6000\" />\n\nOn November 17, 2008, Metro completed the installation of new stainless steel-grab bars to all 184 6000-series cars.<ref>{{Cite press release|title=Spring-loaded overhead handles installed on series 6000 Metrorail fleet|date=November 17, 2008|publisher=[[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]]|url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2346|access-date=December 12, 2008}}</ref>\n\n=== Pilot programs ===\nIn 2007, Metro began testing new resilient flooring on four 6000-series cars (6104+6105, 6142+6143),<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Metro tests new railcar designs |date=December 4, 2007 |publisher=[[Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/PressReleaseDetail.cfm?ReleaseID=1883 |access-date=November 13, 2014}}</ref> and they announced in November 2013 that within two years, all 5000 and 6000-series cars would feature the new flooring.<ref name=\"carpet\" />\n\nMetro tested new fabric seating on cars 6026\u20136027.

If the pilot program goes well, the remaining cars will be given the new look. WMATA says repainting would cost $14,055 per car, while implementing a vinyl wrap costs only $4,776.

The \"B\" cars can be operated however using smaller [[hostler (rail)|hostler]] controls instead. The married pairs are composed of one of each type. This arrangement favors four- and eight-car trains in A&ndash;B&ndash;B&ndash;A and A&ndash;B&ndash;B&ndash;A&ndash;A&ndash;B&ndash;B&ndash;A configurations, but six-car trains in A&ndash;B&ndash;B&ndash;A&ndash;B&ndash;A and trains in any configuration are also possible.

He renamed it [[Rancho Azusa de Dalton]], and had built a winery, distillery, vinegar house, meat smokehouse, and flour mill. Also, a [[vineyard]] was planted. Dalton built a house here on a place known as Dalton Hill, near 6th Street and Cerritos Avenue in Azusa.\n\nDalton was also the owner of the adjacent and large [[Rancho San Francisquito (Dalton)|Rancho San Francisquito]] and [[Rancho Santa Anita]] properties.

In 1844 Arenas sold the rancho's land to Henry Dalton, an English immigrant and wealthy merchant from the [[Pueblo of Los Angeles]], for $7,000. He renamed it [[Rancho Azusa de Dalton]], and had built a winery, distillery, vinegar house, meat smokehouse, and flour mill. Also, a [[vineyard]] was planted. Dalton built a house here on a place known as Dalton Hill, near 6th Street and Cerritos Avenue in Azusa.\n\nDalton was also the owner of the adjacent and large [[Rancho San Francisquito (Dalton)|Rancho San Francisquito]] and [[Rancho Santa Anita]] properties.
