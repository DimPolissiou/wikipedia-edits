Some dances require dancers to utilize hula implements such as an ''[[ipu]]'' (single [[gourd]]), ''{{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili'' (waterworn lava stone castanets),''{{okina}}uli{{okina}}uli'' (feathered gourd rattles), ''pu`{{okina}}li'' (split bamboo sticks) or ''kala{{okina}}au'' (rhythm sticks). The older, formal kind of hula is called ''kahiko'', while the modern version is ''{{okina}}auana''. There are also religious chants called ''{{okina}}oli''; when accompanied by [[dance|dancing]] and [[Drum kit|drums]], it is called ''mele hula pahu''.\n\nIn the pre-contact [[Hawaiian language]], the word ''mele'' referred to any kind of poetic expression, though it now translates as ''song''. The two kinds of Hawaiian [[chant]]ing were ''mele oli'' and ''mele hula''. The first were [[a cappella]] individual songs, while the latter were accompanied [[dance music]] performed by a group. The chanters were known as ''haku mele'' and were highly trained composers and performers. Some kinds of chants express emotions like [[angst]] and [[affection]], or request a favor from another person. Other chants are for specific purposes like [[Hawaiian name|naming]], (''mele inoa''), [[prayer]] (''mele pule''), [[surfing]] (''mele he'e nalu'') and [[genealogy|genealogical]] recitations (''mele koihonua''). Mele chants were governed by strict rules, and were performed in a number of styles include the rapid ''kepakepa'' and the enunciate ''koihonua''.\n\n== Music history ==\n\nHistorical documentation of Hawaiian music does not extend prior to the late 18th century, when non-Hawaiians (''haoles'') arrived on the island. From 1778 onward, Hawaii began a period of acculturation with the introduction of numerous styles of European music, including the hymns (''himeni'') introduced by Protestant missionary choirs. Spanish-speaking Mexican cowboys (''paniolos''), were particularly influential immigrants in the field of music, introducing [[string instrument]]s such as the [[guitar]] and possibly also the technique of [[falsetto]] singing, while Portuguese immigrants brought the [[ukulele]]-like [[Cavaquinho|braguinha]].<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/> also immigrants from all over the world had brought their own instruments along with them to the islands.\n\nElizabeth Tatar divided Hawaiian music history into seven periods, beginning with the initial arrival of Europeans and their musical cultures, spanning approximately from 1820 to 1872. The subsequent period lasted to the beginning of the 20th century, and was marked by the creation of an acculturated yet characteristically Hawaiian modern style, while European instruments spread across the islands. Tatar's third period, from 1900 to about 1915, saw the integration of Hawaiian music into the broader field of American popular music, with the invention of ''hapa haole'' songs, which use the English language and only superficial elements of Hawaiian music; the beginning of the Hawaiian recording industry was in 1906, when the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] made the first 53 recordings in the state.<ref name=\"autogenerated228\">\"Footsteps in the Dark: The Hidden Histories of Popular Music\"; By George Lipsitz; page 228; Publisher: University of Minnesota Press; {{ISBN|0816650195}}; {{ISBN|9780816650194}}</ref>  By 1912, recorded Hawaiian music had found an audience on the American mainland.<ref name=\"Tatar\">Tatar, Elizabeth, in George Kanahele's ''Hawaiian Music and Musicians''</ref> [[Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii]] began when [[Puerto Rico]]'s sugar industry was devastated by two [[hurricanes]] in 1899. The devastation caused a worldwide shortage in sugar and a huge demand for the product from [[Hawaii]]. Hawaiian [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]] owners began to recruit the jobless, but experienced, laborers in Puerto Rico. They took with them their music and in the early 1900s introduced what is known as [[Cachi Cachi music]], on the islands of Hawaii.<ref name=\"autogenerated228\"/>\n\nFrom 1915 to 1930, mainstream audiences outside of Hawaii became increasingly enamored of Hawaiian music, though by this time the songs marketed as ''Hawaiian'' had only peripheral aspects of actual Hawaiian music. Tahitian and Samoan music had an influence on Hawaiian music during this period, especially in their swifter and more intricate rhythms. The following era, from about 1930 to 1960, has been called the \"Golden Age of Hawaiian music\", when popular styles were adapted for [[orchestra]]s and [[big band]]s, and Hawaiian performers like [[Lani McIntire]], [[John Kameaaloha Almeida]] and [[Sol Ho\u02bbopi\u02bbi]] became mainstream stars. In the 1960s, Hawaiian-style music declined in popularity amid an influx of rock, soul and pop acts from the American mainland. This trend reversed itself in the final period of Hawaiian music history, the modern period beginning with the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]] in the 1970s and continuing with the foundation of a variety of modern music scenes in fields like [[indie rock]], [[Hawaii hip hop music|Hawaiian hip hop]] and [[Jawaiian]].<ref name=\"Tatar\"/>\n\n=== Lili\u02bbuokalani and Henri Berger ===\n[[File:Liliuokalani, photograph by Menzies Dickson, National Library of New Zealand.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Lili'uokalani]]\n\nQueen [[Liliuokalani|Lili\u02bbuokalani]] was the last Queen of Hawaii before the [[Hawaiian monarchy]] was overthrown. She was also a musician and prolific composer [[list of compositions and works of Queen Liliuokalani of Hawaii|who wrote many musical works]]. She was best known for ''[[Aloha 'Oe]]''. A compilation of her works, titled \"The Queen's Songbook\", was published in 1999 by [http://www.onipaa.org/ The Queen Lili'uokalani Trust].\n[[file:Madam_Alapai,_Henry_N._Clark_-_Aloha_Oe.ogg|left|thumb|Aloha'oe performed by Madam Alapai in 1911.]]\nLili'uokalani was one of many members of the Hawaiian royal family with musical inclinations. They studied under a [[Prussia]]n military bandleader, [[Henri Berger]], who was sent by the [[Kaiser]] at the request of [[Kamehameha V]]. Berger became fascinated by Hawaiian folk music, and wrote much documentation on it. However, he also brought his own musical background in [[music of Germany|German music]], and heavily guided the Hawaiian musicians and composers he worked with.\n\nKing Kamehameha V also, in 1847, sent to Germany for a \"band Leader\" for \"The Kings Own Band\", now the Royal Hawaiian Band, William Mersberg, from Weimar, Germany. He is [[Henry Kaleialoha Allen]]'s great grandfather. Henry Kaleialoha Allen is \"one of Hawaii's Living Treasures of Hawaiian Music\" and a master music educator and has been honored many times on the Senate Floor and by the Legislature for such.\n\n=== Guitar innovations ===\nGuitars could have come to Hawaii from several sources: sailors, missionaries, or travelers to and from California. The most frequently told story is that it accompanied the Mexican cowboys (''vaqueros'') brought by King [[Kamehameha III]] in 1832 in order to teach the natives how to control an overpopulation of [[Hawaiian wild cattle|cattle]]. The Hawaiian cowboys (''paniolo'') used guitars in their traditional folk music. The Portuguese introduced an instrument called the ''braguinha'', a small, four-stringed [[Madeira]] variant of the [[cavaquinho]]; this instrument was a precursor to the [[`ukulele]].<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>\n\nSteel-string guitars also arrived with the Portuguese in the 1860s and slack-key had spread across the chain by the late 1880s. A ship called the ''Ravenscrag'' arrived in Honolulu on August 23, 1879, bringing Portuguese field workers from [[Madeira]]. Legend has it that one of the men, Jo\u00e3o Fernandes, later a popular musician, tried to impress the Hawaiians by playing folk music with a friend's [[Cavaquinho|braguinha]]; it is also said that the Hawaiians called the instrument ''`ukulele'' (''jumping flea'') in reference to the man's swift fingers. Others have claimed the word means ''gift that came here'' or a corruption of ''ukeke lele'' (''dancing [[ukeke]]'', a three-string bow).<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>\n\nThe popularity throughout the 1920s of Hawaiian music, with its unique slide-style of guitar playing, prompted the invention of the electric guitar in 1931, as a lap steel guitar, the [[Frying pan (guitar)|\"frying pan\"]], by George Beauchamp. Electric amplification allowed the Hawaiian-style guitar to be heard in performances of larger popular bands.\n\n=== Late 19th and early 20th century ===\n[[Image:AlohaOe1913.jpg|right|thumb|1913 sheet music cover]]\n\nIn the 1880s and 90s, King [[David Kalakaua]] promoted Hawaiian culture and also encouraged the addition of new instruments, such as the ukulele and possibly steel guitar; Kalakaua died in 1891, and so it is highly unlikely he would have heard it.<ref>See: Kanahele, George S., ''Hawaiian Music and Musicians'', pp 367\u2013368</ref> Kalakaua's successor, his sister [[Lili'uokalani]], was also a prolific composer and wrote several songs, like \"Aloha 'Oe\", which remain popular. During this period, Hawaiian music evolved into a \"new distinctive\" style, using the derivatives of European instruments; aside from the widespread string instruments, [[brass band]]s like the [[Royal Hawaiian Band]] performed Hawaiian songs as well as popular marches and ragtimes.\n\nIn about 1889, [[Joseph Kekuku]] began sliding a piece of steel across the strings of a guitar, thus inventing [[steel guitar]] (''kika kila''); at about the same time, traditional Hawaiian music with [[English language|English]] lyrics became popular. Vocals predominated in Hawaiian music until the 20th century, when instrumentation took a lead role. Much of modern slack-key guitar has become entirely instrumental.<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>\n\nFrom about 1895 to 1915, Hawaiian music dance bands became in demand more and more. These were typically string quintets. [[Ragtime]] music influenced the music, and English words were commonly used in the lyrics. This type of Hawaiian music, influenced by popular music and with lyrics being a combination of English and Hawaiian (or wholly English), is called [[hapa haole]] (literally: half white) music. In 1903, [[Albert \"Sonny\" Cunha]] composed ''My Waikiki Mermaid'', arguably the first popular hapa haole song (The earliest known hapa haole song, \"Eating of the Poi\", was published in ''Ka Buke o na Leo Mele Hawaii...o na Home Hawaii'' in Honolulu in 1888 [See Kanahele, George S., ''Hawaiian Music and Musicians'' pp 71\u201372]).\n\nIn 1927, Rose Moe (1908\u20131999), a Hawaiian singer, with her husband [[Tau Moe]] (1908\u20132004), a Samoan guitarist, began touring with ''Madame Riviere's Hawaiians''. In 1929 they recorded eight songs in [[Tokyo]]. Rose and Tau continued touring for over fifty years, living in countries such as Germany, Lebanon and India. They even performed in Germany as late as 1938 when the Nazi racism was on the rise and people of a darker color were regarded as inferior people; it is said that they even performed for [[Adolf Hitler]] himself.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/05/local/me-passings5.3|title=Tau Moe, 95; Performed Hawaiian Music for Many World Leaders|date=2004-07-05|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-12-31|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> With their children, the Tau Moe family did much to spread the sound of Hawaiian folk music and hapa haole music throughout the world. In 1988, the Tau Moe family re-recorded the 1929 sessions with the help of musician and ethnomusicologist Bob Brozman.\n\nThe 1920s also saw the development of a uniquely Hawaiian style of [[jazz]], innovated by performers at the Moana and Royal Hawaiian Hotels.<ref name=\"Wong 2006\">{{cite web |title=History of the Hawaii International Jazz Festival |first=Randy |last=Wong |date=January 19, 2006|accessdate=September 10, 2012 |url=http://www.hawaiijazz.com/historyofhijf.pdf |archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070703011431/http://www.hawaiijazz.com/historyofhijf.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 3, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n====Slack key guitar====\n{{main|Slack-key guitar}}\nSlack-key guitar (''k\u012b ho`alu'' in Hawaiian) is a fingerpicked playing style, named for the fact that the strings are most often \"slacked\" or loosened to create an open (unfingered) chord, either a major chord (the most common is G, which is called \"taro patch\" tuning) or a major 7th (called a \"wahine\" tuning). A tuning might be invented to play a particular song or facilitate a particular effect, and as late as the 1960s they were often treated as family secrets and passed from generation to generation. By the time of the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]], though, the example of players such as [[Auntie Alice Namakelua]], [[Leonard Kwan]], [[Raymond Kane]], and [[Keola Beamer]] had encouraged the sharing of the tunings and techniques and probably saved the style from extinction. Playing techniques include \"hammering-on\", \"pulling-off\", \"chimes\" (harmonics), and \"slides,\" and these effects frequently mimic the falsettos and vocal breaks common in Hawaiian singing.\n\nThe guitar entered Hawaiian culture from a number of directions&mdash;sailors, settlers, contract workers. One important source of the style was Mexican cowboys hired to work on the Big Island of Hawai{{okina}}i in the first half of the 19th century. These [[paniolo]] brought their guitars and their music, and when they left, the Hawaiians developed their own style of playing the instrument.\n\nSlack key guitar evolved to accompany the rhythms of Hawaiian dancing and the melodies of Hawaiian chant. Hawaiian music in general, which was promoted under the reign of [[King David Kalakaua]] as a matter of national pride and cultural revival, drew rhythms from traditional Hawaiian beats and European military marches, and drew its melodies from Christian hymns and the cosmopolitan peoples of the islands (although principally American).\n\n==== Popularization ====\n[[File:Bird of Paradise Ad.jpg|thumb|left|An advertisement for the Broadway show \"The Bird of Paradise\"]]\nIn the early 20th century Hawaiians began touring the United States, often in small bands. A [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show called ''[[Richard Walton Tully|Bird of Paradise]]'' introduced Hawaiian music to many Americans in 1912 and the [[Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition]] in [[San Francisco]] followed in 1915; one year later, Hawaiian music sold more recordings than any other style in the country.\n\nThe increasing popularization of Hawaiian music influenced [[blues]] and [[country music|country]] musicians; this connection can still be heard in modern country. In reverse, musicians like [[Bennie Nawahi]] began incorporating [[jazz]] into his [[steel guitar]], [[ukulele]] and [[mandolin]] music, while the [[Kalama Quartet]] introduced a style of group falsetto singing.\n\nThe musician [[Sol Ho\u02bbopi\u02bbi]] arose during this time, playing both Hawaiian music and jazz, Western swing and country, and developing the pedal steel guitar; his recordings helped establish the [[Nashville sound]] of popular country music.<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/> [[Lani McIntire]] was another musician who infused a Hawaiian guitar sound into mainstream American popular music through his recordings with [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and [[Bing Crosby]].\n[[File:Hawaiian Music Record Ad.jpg|thumb|A 1916 advertisement for Hawaiian music records from Victor Records.]]\nIn the 1920s and 30s, Hawaiian music became an integral part of [[tourism in Hawaii|local tourism]], with most hotels and attractions incorporating music in one form or another. Among the earliest and most popular musical attractions was the ''Kodak Hula Show'', sponsored by [[Kodak]], in which a tourist purchased Kodak film and took photographs of dancers and musicians.<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>  The show ran from 1937 through 2002. Several vinyl LPs featuring music from the Kodak Hula Show were released by Waikiki Records, with full color photographs of the show's performers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for hi-fi living : the vinyl LP in midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962-|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=260\u2013261|oclc=958205262}}</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the mostly young men who hung around the Honolulu beaches, swimming and surfing, came to be known as the [[Waikiki Beachboys]] and their parties became famous across Hawaii and abroad; most of them played the ukulele all day long, sitting on the beach and eventually began working for hotels to entertain tourists.\n\nPopular Hawaiian music with English verse (hapa haole) can be described in a narrow sense. Generally, songs are sung to the ukulele or steel guitar. A steel string guitar sometimes accompanies. Melodies often feature an intervallic leap, such as a perfect fourth or octave. Falsetto vocals are suited for such leaps and are common in Hawaiian singing, as is the use of microtones. Rhythm is mostly in duple meter. A musical scale that is unique to Hawaiian music imbues it with its distinct feel, and so is aptly named the Hawaiian scale.\n\nThe Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco in 1915 introduced Hawaiian steel guitar to mainland country music artists, and by the 1930s country stars Hoot Gibson and Jimmy Davis were making records with Hawaiian musicians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heyrobertsilva.com/blog/2010/08/17/johnny-cash-in-a-grass-skirt-the-hawaiian-roots-of-country/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422035800/http://heyrobertsilva.com/blog/2010/08/17/johnny-cash-in-a-grass-skirt-the-hawaiian-roots-of-country/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 22, 2017 |accessdate=August 25, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe influx of thousands of American servicemen into Hawaii during World War II created a demand for both popular swing rhythm and country sounds. The western swing style, popular on the mainland since the 1930s, employed the steel guitar as a key element and was therefore a natural evolution. Beginning in 1945, the Bell Record Company of Honolulu responded to the demand with a series of releases by the western swing band Fiddling Sam and his Hawaiian Buckaroos (led by fiddler Homer H. Spivey, and including Lloyd C. Moore, Tiny Barton, Al Hittle, Calvert Duke, Tolbert E. Stinnett and Raymond \"Blackie\" Barnes). Between 1945\u20131950 Bell released some 40 sides by the Hawaiian Buckaroos, including a set of square dance numbers.\n\n== Modern music ==\nIn recent decades, traditional Hawaiian music has undergone a renaissance, with renewed interest from both ethnic Hawaiians and others. The islands have also produced a number of well-regarded [[rock and roll|rock]], [[pop music|pop]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Dubstep]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[reggae]] performers, and many local musicians in the clubs of Waikiki and Honolulu play outside the various \"Hawaiian\" genres. Hawaii has its own regional music industry, with several distinctive styles of recorded popular music. Hawaiian popular music is largely based on [[American popular music]], but does have distinctive retentions from traditional Hawaiian music.<ref name=\"Manuel\"/>\n\n=== Hawaiian Renaissance ===\n{{main|Hawaiian Renaissance}}\nThe Hawaiian Renaissance was a resurgence in interest in Hawaiian music, especially slack-key, among ethnic Hawaiians. Long-standing performers like [[Gabby Pahinui]] found their careers revitalized; Pahinui, who had begun recording in 1947, finally reached mainstream audiences across the United States when sessions on which [[Ry Cooder]] played with him and his family were released as ''The Gabby Pahinui Hawaiian Band, Vol. 1'' on a major mainland label. Pahinui inspired a legion of followers who played a mix of slack-key, reggae, country, rock and other styles. The more traditional players included [[Leland Isaacs Sr.|Leland \"Atta\" Isaacs, Sr.]], [[Sonny Chillingworth]], [[Ray Kane]], [[Leonard Kwan]], [[Ledward Ka`apana]], [[Dennis Pavao]], while [[Keola Beamer]] and [[Peter Moon (musician)|Peter Moon]] have been more eclectic in their approach. The Emerson brothers rekindled the classic sound of Sol Ho'opi'i with the National steel guitar on their vintage 1920s stylings. [[George Kanahele]]'s [[Hawaiian Music Foundation]] did much to spread slack-key and other forms of Hawaiian music, especially after a major 1972 concert.<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>\n\n[[Don Ho]] (1930\u20132007), originally from the small Honolulu neighborhood of Kaka'ako, was the most widely known Hawaiian entertainer of the last decades of the 20th century. Although he did not play \"traditional\" Hawaiian music, Ho became an unofficial ambassador of Hawaiian culture throughout the world as well as on the American mainland. Ho's style often combined traditional Hawaiian elements and older 1950s and 1960s-style crooner music with an easy listening touch.\n\n[[Loyal Garner]] also embraced Hawaiian elements in her Vegas-style lounge act and in the songs she recorded. A third notable performer, [[Myra English]], became known as the \"Champagne Lady\" after recording the song \"Drinking Champagne\" by [[Bill Mack (singer)|Bill Mack]] in 1963 became her signature song in Hawaii, and she achieved considerable commercial success both locally and abroad.\n\n=== Jawaiian ===\n\nJawaiian is a Hawaiian style of [[reggae]] music. Reggae music is a genre that evolved in the late 1960s and earlier in [[Jamaica]]. It has become popular across the world, especially among ethnic groups and races that have been historically oppressed, such as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Pacific Islanders]], and [[Australian Aborigine]]s. In Hawaii, [[Native Hawaiians|ethnic Hawaiians]] and others in the state began playing a mixture of reggae and local music in the early 1980s, although it was not until the late 1980s that it became recognized as a new genre in local music. The band Simplisity has been credited by [[Quiet Storm Records]] as originators of the Jawaiian style. By the end of the 1980s, Jawaiian came to dominate the local music scene, as well as spawning a backlash that the ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'' compared to the \"[[disco]] sucks\" movement of the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=January 12, 2006 |title='02 not the year Jawaiian dies, but look out|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|url=http://starbulletin.com/2002/01/01/features/story2.html}}</ref>\n\nReggae culture as a whole began to dominate Hawaii, as many locals can be seen sporting Bob Marley memorabilia, and lots of local merchandise and souvenirs have been emblazoned with the red, yellow, and green colors of the Hawaiian sovereignty as well as the Lion of Judah flag, a known symbol of the [[Rastafari movement]]. The Rasta colors have also become a symbol of local pride.\n\n=== Rock and Roll ===\n\n[[Rock and Roll]] music has long been popular in Hawaii - numerous rock and roll artists spent their developmental years in Hawaii (i.e. members of [[The Association]], [[The Electric Prunes]], [[7th Order]], [[Vicious Rumors]], as well as guitarists [[Marty Friedman]] and [[Charles Foster Johnson|Charlie \"Icarus\" Johnson]]), and its local popularity dates back to the earliest days of rock music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottymoore.net/honolulu.html|title=Scotty Moore - Honolulu Stadium - Honolulu, HI|website=www.scottymoore.net|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> [[Elvis Presley]]'s career included several Hawaii-related performances and records: a March 1961 live performance to raise money for the construction of the [[USS Arizona Memorial]] at the [[Pearl Harbor]] Bloch Arena in March 1961,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottymoore.net/blocharena.html|title=Scotty Moore - Bloch Arena And The USS Arizona Memorial|website=www.scottymoore.net|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref>  his ''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite]]'' \"comeback\" record and concert in 1973, and three of his movies were based in Hawaii (''[[Blue Hawaii]]'', ''[[Girls!

Mihana Souza. Although Hawaiian vocalist [[Melveen Leed]] is known primarily for singing Hawaiian and \"Hawaiian country\" music, she has also earned good reviews as a jazz singer.\n\nThere are frequent performances by the [[University of Hawaii]] jazz bands.\n\n=== Ukulele ===\n{{main|Ukulele}}\nThe [[ukulele]] was introduced to [[Hawaii]] by [[Madeira]]n immigrants near the close of the 19th century. The Portuguese brought a small guitar-like instrument, known as the [[cavaquinho|machete]]. The instrument became a very popular one in Hawaiian culture, and a majority of Hawaiian songs involve the ukulele. In Hawaiian, ukulele literally means \"flea (uku) jumping (lele).\" It was named as such because when plucked, the high pitch of the strings brings to mind the image of a jumping flea. There are currently four sizes of ukulele; soprano, concert, tenor and baritone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fun Facts - The Ukulele|url=http://luaukalamaku.com/kauai_luau_fun_facts_the_ukulele.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413042518/http://luaukalamaku.com/kauai_luau_fun_facts_the_ukulele.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-04-13|publisher=Luaukalamaku.com|accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref>\n\nQueen Liliuokalani, the last Hawaiian Queen, believed that the name for the ukulele means \"The gift that came here\".

This makes Koa ukuleles very distinguishable by sound. Because of this, koa wood is known as a revered wood to create an ukulele. Not only are koa ukuleles distinguishable by sound, but also by looks. They have a very unique grain pattern and color that allows them to stand out more than the average wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-6/Ukulele.html|title=How ukulele is made - production process, manufacture, making, history, used, parts, product, machine, History|website=www.madehow.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref>{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n=== \u2018\u016ak\u0113k\u0113 ===\nThe [[Ukeke]] is a Hawaiian musical bow played with the mouth.

According to ''Arts and Crafts of Hawai`i'' by Te Rangi Hiroa, old flutes in the [[Bishop Museum]] collection have a hole at the node area for the breath, and two or three fingering holes. In the three-finger-hole specimen, one fingering hole is placed near the breath hole. Lengths range from 10\u201321 inches (250\u2013530&nbsp;mm). Oral tradition in various families states that numbers of fingering holes ranged from one to four, and location of the holes varied depending on the musical taste of the player.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Arts and Crafts of Hawai\u02bbi|last=Te Rangi Hiroa|publisher=Bishop Museum Press|year=2003|location=Honolulu, HI|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThough primarily a courting instrument played privately and for personal enjoyment, it also could be used in conjunction with chants, song, and hula. [[Kumu Hula|Kumu hula]] (dance masters), were said to be able to either make the flute sound as though it were chanting, or to chant as they played. Kumu hula Leilehua Yuen is one of the few contemporary Hawaiian musicians to perform with the nose flute in this manner.\n\nInto the 19th and early 20th centuries, young men still used the 'ohe hano ihu as a way to win the affection and love of a woman.<ref name=\"Ranga Pae\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rangapae.com/Nose%20Flute%20page.htm |title=Ohe hano ihu |work=Rangapae.com|date= May 24, 2008 |accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref> Today, the `ohe hano ihu is enjoying a resurgence of popularity.\n\nTwo different oral traditions explain the use of the nose for playing the `ohe hano ihu. According to one, the `ohe hano ihu is played with air from the nose rather than from the mouth because a person's'' h\u0101'', breath, is expressive of the person's inner being. As the h\u0101 travels from the ''na`ao'', or gut, through the mouth, the h\u0101 can be used to lie. When the h\u0101 travels through the nose, it cannot lie. Therefore, if a young man loves a woman, that love will be expressed in the music he plays with his `ohe hano ihu. According to the other tradition, the instrument is played with the nose to enable the player to softly sing or chant while playing.\n\nModern folklore says that the Hawaiian flute expresses \"[[aloha]]\" because to hear the flute one must come close to the ''alo'', \"face\" or \"presence\" of the player to hear the ''h\u0101'', \"divine breath\" and so the listener experiences \"being in one another's presence sharing the divine breath.\" While useful as a way to remember the contemplative and personal nature of the traditional Hawaiian flute, there is no actual etymological evidence, nor is there evidence in traditional chants or stories, to support this etymology. In the Hawaiian language, ''h\u0101'', breath, is unrelated to the word ''ha'', a causative prefix. a search of cognate words in related languages also reveals no such etymologies for the word \"aloha\".\n\nAccording to the book ''`Ohe'', by Leilehua Yuen, the instrument was popularized in the 1970s by members of the Beamer family who played it during performances on tour in North America, as well as in the Hawaiian Islands. Segments of the children's educational TV show, Sesame Street, showing Keola Beamer and Mr. Snuffalupagus, one of the large puppet characters, playing `ohe hano ihu brought the instrument to national attention. Winona Beamer, Keola Beamer's mother, a noted kumu hula, also taught the use of the `ohe hano ihu in hula. Her h\u0101nai daughter, Maile Beamer Loo, continues to preserve and teach that legacy, and document such important aspects of Hawaiian musical and performing heritage through the Hula Preservation Society.\n\nNotable late 20th Century and early 21st Century musicians of the`ohe hano ihu include Mahi Beamer, Nona Beamer, Keola Beamer, Kapono Beamer, Calvin Hoe, Nelson Kaai, Anthony Natividad, and Manu Josiah.\n\n=== Other ===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nThe music that is considered popular or \"underground\" in Hawaii does not necessarily correspond to similar genres in mainland areas of the U.S.A. This is partly a result of Hawaiian music, which appeals to many generations; in contrast, music like heavy metal or punk rock appeals primarily to a more youthful generation, and is not considered as commercially attractive to tourism. [[Na mele paleoleo]] is an emerging form of Hawaiian rap.\n\nIt is difficult to promote popular acts from the mainland due to its geographical isolation, and the smaller group of people interested in the music.\n\n[[Bruno Mars]] from Honolulu has 6 #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits, including \"[[Uptown Funk]]\" in 2015. [[Yvonne Elliman]], from Honolulu, had a #1 Hot 100 hit with the disco song \"[[If I Can't Have You (Bee Gees song)|If I Can't Have You]]\" from [[Saturday Night Fever]] in 1978. [[Bette Midler]], also from Honolulu, had a #1 Hot 100 hit with \"[[Wind Beneath My Wings]]\" in 1989. [[Glenn Medeiros]] had a #1 Hot 100 hit in 1990 with \"[[She Ain't Worth It]]\" ft. Bobby Brown. [[Tane Cain]], who was raised in Hawaii, had a #37 Hot 100 hit with \"[[Holdin' On]]\" in 1982.\n\n===McDonald's NextNext Music: Sounds That Spark Change===\nIn 2016, [[McDonald's]] of [[Hawaii]] launched the NextNext Music: Sounds That Spark Change competition and charity event that featured 40 Hawaii musicians, bands and artists.

The [[Guitar and Lute Workshop]] was an early manufacturer and proponent of specialty [[slack-key guitar]]s in the early 1970s, and the [[Kamaka Ukulele]] company was established as key manufacturer of ukuleles for Hawaiian musical acts.\n\n== Folk music ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Honky tonk]] -->\n\n[[File:Hula0081110.jpg|thumb|Dancer with \u02bbuli\u02bbuli, hula kahiko competition, [[Merrie Monarch Festival]] 2003]]\nHawaiian folk music includes several varieties of chanting (''[[Mele (Hawaiian language)|mele]]'') and music meant for highly ritualized dance (''[[hula]]''). Traditional Hawaiian music and dance was functional, used to express praise, communicate genealogy and mythology, and accompany games, festivals and other secular events. The [[Hawaiian language]] has no word that translates precisely as ''music'', but a diverse vocabulary exists to describe rhythms, instruments, styles and elements of voice production. Hawaiian folk music is simple in [[melody]] and [[rhythm]], but is \"complex and rich\" in the \"poetry, accompanying mimetic dance (''hula''), and subtleties of vocal styles... even in the attenuated forms in which they survive today\".<ref name=\"Manuel\"/>\n\n[[Image:US Navy hula 031112-N-3228G-001.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Hula performance at a ceremony depicting the turning over [[U.S. Navy]] control over the island of [[Kahoolawe]] to the state performed by Uncle Frank Kawaikapuokalani Hewett]]\n\nThe chant (''mele'') is typically accompanied by an ''ipu heke'' (a double [[gourd]]) and/or ''pahu'' (sharkskin covered drum). Some dances require dancers to utilize hula implements such as an ''[[ipu]]'' (single [[gourd]]), ''{{okina}}ili{{okina}}ili'' (waterworn lava stone castanets),''{{okina}}uli{{okina}}uli'' (feathered gourd rattles), ''pu`{{okina}}li'' (split bamboo sticks) or ''kala{{okina}}au'' (rhythm sticks). The older, formal kind of hula is called ''kahiko'', while the modern version is ''{{okina}}auana''. There are also religious chants called ''{{okina}}oli''; when accompanied by [[dance|dancing]] and [[Drum kit|drums]], it is called ''mele hula pahu''.\n\nIn the pre-contact [[Hawaiian language]], the word ''mele'' referred to any kind of poetic expression, though it now translates as ''song''. The two kinds of Hawaiian [[chant]]ing were ''mele oli'' and ''mele hula''. The first were [[a cappella]] individual songs, while the latter were accompanied [[dance music]] performed by a group. The chanters were known as ''haku mele'' and were highly trained composers and performers. Some kinds of chants express emotions like [[angst]] and [[affection]], or request a favor from another person. Other chants are for specific purposes like [[Hawaiian name|naming]], (''mele inoa''), [[prayer]] (''mele pule''), [[surfing]] (''mele he'e nalu'') and [[genealogy|genealogical]] recitations (''mele koihonua''). Mele chants were governed by strict rules, and were performed in a number of styles include the rapid ''kepakepa'' and the enunciate ''koihonua''.\n\n== Music history ==\n\nHistorical documentation of Hawaiian music does not extend prior to the late 18th century, when non-Hawaiians (''haoles'') arrived on the island. From 1778 onward, Hawaii began a period of acculturation with the introduction of numerous styles of European music, including the hymns (''himeni'') introduced by Protestant missionary choirs. Spanish-speaking Mexican cowboys (''paniolos''), were particularly influential immigrants in the field of music, introducing [[string instrument]]s such as the [[guitar]] and possibly also the technique of [[falsetto]] singing, while Portuguese immigrants brought the [[ukulele]]-like [[Cavaquinho|braguinha]].<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/> also immigrants from all over the world had brought their own instruments along with them to the islands.\n\nElizabeth Tatar divided Hawaiian music history into seven periods, beginning with the initial arrival of Europeans and their musical cultures, spanning approximately from 1820 to 1872. The subsequent period lasted to the beginning of the 20th century, and was marked by the creation of an acculturated yet characteristically Hawaiian modern style, while European instruments spread across the islands. Tatar's third period, from 1900 to about 1915, saw the integration of Hawaiian music into the broader field of American popular music, with the invention of ''hapa haole'' songs, which use the English language and only superficial elements of Hawaiian music; the beginning of the Hawaiian recording industry was in 1906, when the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] made the first 53 recordings in the state.<ref name=\"autogenerated228\">\"Footsteps in the Dark: The Hidden Histories of Popular Music\"; By George Lipsitz; page 228; Publisher: University of Minnesota Press; {{ISBN|0816650195}}; {{ISBN|9780816650194}}</ref>  By 1912, recorded Hawaiian music had found an audience on the American mainland.<ref name=\"Tatar\">Tatar, Elizabeth, in George Kanahele's ''Hawaiian Music and Musicians''</ref> [[Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii]] began when [[Puerto Rico]]'s sugar industry was devastated by two [[hurricanes]] in 1899. The devastation caused a worldwide shortage in sugar and a huge demand for the product from [[Hawaii]]. Hawaiian [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii|plantation]] owners began to recruit the jobless, but experienced, laborers in Puerto Rico. They took with them their music and in the early 1900s introduced what is known as [[Cachi Cachi music]], on the islands of Hawaii.<ref name=\"autogenerated228\"/>\n\nFrom 1915 to 1930, mainstream audiences outside of Hawaii became increasingly enamored of Hawaiian music, though by this time the songs marketed as ''Hawaiian'' had only peripheral aspects of actual Hawaiian music. Tahitian and Samoan music had an influence on Hawaiian music during this period, especially in their swifter and more intricate rhythms. The following era, from about 1930 to 1960, has been called the \"Golden Age of Hawaiian music\", when popular styles were adapted for [[orchestra]]s and [[big band]]s, and Hawaiian performers like [[Lani McIntire]], [[John Kameaaloha Almeida]] and [[Sol Ho\u02bbopi\u02bbi]] became mainstream stars. In the 1960s, Hawaiian-style music declined in popularity amid an influx of rock, soul and pop acts from the American mainland. This trend reversed itself in the final period of Hawaiian music history, the modern period beginning with the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]] in the 1970s and continuing with the foundation of a variety of modern music scenes in fields like [[indie rock]], [[Hawaii hip hop music|Hawaiian hip hop]] and [[Jawaiian]].<ref name=\"Tatar\"/>\n\n=== Lili\u02bbuokalani and Henri Berger ===\n[[File:Liliuokalani, photograph by Menzies Dickson, National Library of New Zealand.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Lili'uokalani]]\n\nQueen [[Liliuokalani|Lili\u02bbuokalani]] was the last Queen of Hawaii before the [[Hawaiian monarchy]] was overthrown. She was also a musician and prolific composer [[list of compositions and works of Queen Liliuokalani of Hawaii|who wrote many musical works]]. She was best known for ''[[Aloha 'Oe]]''. A compilation of her works, titled \"The Queen's Songbook\", was published in 1999 by [http://www.onipaa.org/ The Queen Lili'uokalani Trust].\n[[file:Madam_Alapai,_Henry_N._Clark_-_Aloha_Oe.ogg|left|thumb|Aloha'oe performed by Madam Alapai in 1911.]]\nLili'uokalani was one of many members of the Hawaiian royal family with musical inclinations. They studied under a [[Prussia]]n military bandleader, [[Henri Berger]], who was sent by the [[Kaiser]] at the request of [[Kamehameha V]]. Berger became fascinated by Hawaiian folk music, and wrote much documentation on it. However, he also brought his own musical background in [[music of Germany|German music]], and heavily guided the Hawaiian musicians and composers he worked with.\n\nKing Kamehameha V also, in 1847, sent to Germany for a \"band Leader\" for \"The Kings Own Band\", now the Royal Hawaiian Band, William Mersberg, from Weimar, Germany. He is [[Henry Kaleialoha Allen]]'s great grandfather. Henry Kaleialoha Allen is \"one of Hawaii's Living Treasures of Hawaiian Music\" and a master music educator and has been honored many times on the Senate Floor and by the Legislature for such.\n\n=== Guitar innovations ===\nGuitars could have come to Hawaii from several sources: sailors, missionaries, or travelers to and from California. The most frequently told story is that it accompanied the Mexican cowboys (''vaqueros'') brought by King [[Kamehameha III]] in 1832 in order to teach the natives how to control an overpopulation of [[Hawaiian wild cattle|cattle]]. The Hawaiian cowboys (''paniolo'') used guitars in their traditional folk music. The Portuguese introduced an instrument called the ''braguinha'', a small, four-stringed [[Madeira]] variant of the [[cavaquinho]]; this instrument was a precursor to the [[`ukulele]].<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>\n\nSteel-string guitars also arrived with the Portuguese in the 1860s and slack-key had spread across the chain by the late 1880s. A ship called the ''Ravenscrag'' arrived in Honolulu on August 23, 1879, bringing Portuguese field workers from [[Madeira]]. Legend has it that one of the men, Jo\u00e3o Fernandes, later a popular musician, tried to impress the Hawaiians by playing folk music with a friend's [[Cavaquinho|braguinha]]; it is also said that the Hawaiians called the instrument ''`ukulele'' (''jumping flea'') in reference to the man's swift fingers. Others have claimed the word means ''gift that came here'' or a corruption of ''ukeke lele'' (''dancing [[ukeke]]'', a three-string bow).<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>\n\nThe popularity throughout the 1920s of Hawaiian music, with its unique slide-style of guitar playing, prompted the invention of the electric guitar in 1931, as a lap steel guitar, the [[Frying pan (guitar)|\"frying pan\"]], by George Beauchamp. Electric amplification allowed the Hawaiian-style guitar to be heard in performances of larger popular bands.\n\n=== Late 19th and early 20th century ===\n[[Image:AlohaOe1913.jpg|right|thumb|1913 sheet music cover]]\n\nIn the 1880s and 90s, King [[David Kalakaua]] promoted Hawaiian culture and also encouraged the addition of new instruments, such as the ukulele and possibly steel guitar; Kalakaua died in 1891, and so it is highly unlikely he would have heard it.<ref>See: Kanahele, George S., ''Hawaiian Music and Musicians'', pp 367\u2013368</ref> Kalakaua's successor, his sister [[Lili'uokalani]], was also a prolific composer and wrote several songs, like \"Aloha 'Oe\", which remain popular. During this period, Hawaiian music evolved into a \"new distinctive\" style, using the derivatives of European instruments; aside from the widespread string instruments, [[brass band]]s like the [[Royal Hawaiian Band]] performed Hawaiian songs as well as popular marches and ragtimes.\n\nIn about 1889, [[Joseph Kekuku]] began sliding a piece of steel across the strings of a guitar, thus inventing [[steel guitar]] (''kika kila''); at about the same time, traditional Hawaiian music with [[English language|English]] lyrics became popular. Vocals predominated in Hawaiian music until the 20th century, when instrumentation took a lead role. Much of modern slack-key guitar has become entirely instrumental.<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>\n\nFrom about 1895 to 1915, Hawaiian music dance bands became in demand more and more. These were typically string quintets. [[Ragtime]] music influenced the music, and English words were commonly used in the lyrics. This type of Hawaiian music, influenced by popular music and with lyrics being a combination of English and Hawaiian (or wholly English), is called [[hapa haole]] (literally: half white) music. In 1903, [[Albert \"Sonny\" Cunha]] composed ''My Waikiki Mermaid'', arguably the first popular hapa haole song (The earliest known hapa haole song, \"Eating of the Poi\", was published in ''Ka Buke o na Leo Mele Hawaii...o na Home Hawaii'' in Honolulu in 1888 [See Kanahele, George S., ''Hawaiian Music and Musicians'' pp 71\u201372]).\n\nIn 1927, Rose Moe (1908\u20131999), a Hawaiian singer, with her husband [[Tau Moe]] (1908\u20132004), a Samoan guitarist, began touring with ''Madame Riviere's Hawaiians''. In 1929 they recorded eight songs in [[Tokyo]]. Rose and Tau continued touring for over fifty years, living in countries such as Germany, Lebanon and India. They even performed in Germany as late as 1938 when the Nazi racism was on the rise and people of a darker color were regarded as inferior people; it is said that they even performed for [[Adolf Hitler]] himself.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/05/local/me-passings5.3|title=Tau Moe, 95; Performed Hawaiian Music for Many World Leaders|date=2004-07-05|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-12-31|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> With their children, the Tau Moe family did much to spread the sound of Hawaiian folk music and hapa haole music throughout the world. In 1988, the Tau Moe family re-recorded the 1929 sessions with the help of musician and ethnomusicologist Bob Brozman.\n\nThe 1920s also saw the development of a uniquely Hawaiian style of [[jazz]], innovated by performers at the Moana and Royal Hawaiian Hotels.<ref name=\"Wong 2006\">{{cite web |title=History of the Hawaii International Jazz Festival |first=Randy |last=Wong |date=January 19, 2006|accessdate=September 10, 2012 |url=http://www.hawaiijazz.com/historyofhijf.pdf |archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070703011431/http://www.hawaiijazz.com/historyofhijf.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 3, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n====Slack key guitar====\n{{main|Slack-key guitar}}\nSlack-key guitar (''k\u012b ho`alu'' in Hawaiian) is a fingerpicked playing style, named for the fact that the strings are most often \"slacked\" or loosened to create an open (unfingered) chord, either a major chord (the most common is G, which is called \"taro patch\" tuning) or a major 7th (called a \"wahine\" tuning). A tuning might be invented to play a particular song or facilitate a particular effect, and as late as the 1960s they were often treated as family secrets and passed from generation to generation. By the time of the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]], though, the example of players such as [[Auntie Alice Namakelua]], [[Leonard Kwan]], [[Raymond Kane]], and [[Keola Beamer]] had encouraged the sharing of the tunings and techniques and probably saved the style from extinction. Playing techniques include \"hammering-on\", \"pulling-off\", \"chimes\" (harmonics), and \"slides,\" and these effects frequently mimic the falsettos and vocal breaks common in Hawaiian singing.\n\nThe guitar entered Hawaiian culture from a number of directions&mdash;sailors, settlers, contract workers. One important source of the style was Mexican cowboys hired to work on the Big Island of Hawai{{okina}}i in the first half of the 19th century. These [[paniolo]] brought their guitars and their music, and when they left, the Hawaiians developed their own style of playing the instrument.\n\nSlack key guitar evolved to accompany the rhythms of Hawaiian dancing and the melodies of Hawaiian chant. Hawaiian music in general, which was promoted under the reign of [[King David Kalakaua]] as a matter of national pride and cultural revival, drew rhythms from traditional Hawaiian beats and European military marches, and drew its melodies from Christian hymns and the cosmopolitan peoples of the islands (although principally American).\n\n==== Popularization ====\n[[File:Bird of Paradise Ad.jpg|thumb|left|An advertisement for the Broadway show \"The Bird of Paradise\"]]\nIn the early 20th century Hawaiians began touring the United States, often in small bands. A [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show called ''[[Richard Walton Tully|Bird of Paradise]]'' introduced Hawaiian music to many Americans in 1912 and the [[Panama\u2013Pacific International Exposition]] in [[San Francisco]] followed in 1915; one year later, Hawaiian music sold more recordings than any other style in the country.\n\nThe increasing popularization of Hawaiian music influenced [[blues]] and [[country music|country]] musicians; this connection can still be heard in modern country. In reverse, musicians like [[Bennie Nawahi]] began incorporating [[jazz]] into his [[steel guitar]], [[ukulele]] and [[mandolin]] music, while the [[Kalama Quartet]] introduced a style of group falsetto singing.\n\nThe musician [[Sol Ho\u02bbopi\u02bbi]] arose during this time, playing both Hawaiian music and jazz, Western swing and country, and developing the pedal steel guitar; his recordings helped establish the [[Nashville sound]] of popular country music.<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/> [[Lani McIntire]] was another musician who infused a Hawaiian guitar sound into mainstream American popular music through his recordings with [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] and [[Bing Crosby]].\n[[File:Hawaiian Music Record Ad.jpg|thumb|A 1916 advertisement for Hawaiian music records from Victor Records.]]\nIn the 1920s and 30s, Hawaiian music became an integral part of [[tourism in Hawaii|local tourism]], with most hotels and attractions incorporating music in one form or another. Among the earliest and most popular musical attractions was the ''Kodak Hula Show'', sponsored by [[Kodak]], in which a tourist purchased Kodak film and took photographs of dancers and musicians.<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>  The show ran from 1937 through 2002. Several vinyl LPs featuring music from the Kodak Hula Show were released by Waikiki Records, with full color photographs of the show's performers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for hi-fi living : the vinyl LP in midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962-|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=260\u2013261|oclc=958205262}}</ref>\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, the mostly young men who hung around the Honolulu beaches, swimming and surfing, came to be known as the [[Waikiki Beachboys]] and their parties became famous across Hawaii and abroad; most of them played the ukulele all day long, sitting on the beach and eventually began working for hotels to entertain tourists.\n\nPopular Hawaiian music with English verse (hapa haole) can be described in a narrow sense. Generally, songs are sung to the ukulele or steel guitar. A steel string guitar sometimes accompanies. Melodies often feature an intervallic leap, such as a perfect fourth or octave. Falsetto vocals are suited for such leaps and are common in Hawaiian singing, as is the use of microtones. Rhythm is mostly in duple meter. A musical scale that is unique to Hawaiian music imbues it with its distinct feel, and so is aptly named the Hawaiian scale.\n\nThe Panama-Pacific Exposition in San Francisco in 1915 introduced Hawaiian steel guitar to mainland country music artists, and by the 1930s country stars Hoot Gibson and Jimmy Davis were making records with Hawaiian musicians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heyrobertsilva.com/blog/2010/08/17/johnny-cash-in-a-grass-skirt-the-hawaiian-roots-of-country/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170422035800/http://heyrobertsilva.com/blog/2010/08/17/johnny-cash-in-a-grass-skirt-the-hawaiian-roots-of-country/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 22, 2017 |accessdate=August 25, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe influx of thousands of American servicemen into Hawaii during World War II created a demand for both popular swing rhythm and country sounds. The western swing style, popular on the mainland since the 1930s, employed the steel guitar as a key element and was therefore a natural evolution. Beginning in 1945, the Bell Record Company of Honolulu responded to the demand with a series of releases by the western swing band Fiddling Sam and his Hawaiian Buckaroos (led by fiddler Homer H. Spivey, and including Lloyd C. Moore, Tiny Barton, Al Hittle, Calvert Duke, Tolbert E. Stinnett and Raymond \"Blackie\" Barnes). Between 1945\u20131950 Bell released some 40 sides by the Hawaiian Buckaroos, including a set of square dance numbers.\n\n== Modern music ==\nIn recent decades, traditional Hawaiian music has undergone a renaissance, with renewed interest from both ethnic Hawaiians and others. The islands have also produced a number of well-regarded [[rock and roll|rock]], [[pop music|pop]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Dubstep]], [[soul music|soul]] and [[reggae]] performers, and many local musicians in the clubs of Waikiki and Honolulu play outside the various \"Hawaiian\" genres. Hawaii has its own regional music industry, with several distinctive styles of recorded popular music. Hawaiian popular music is largely based on [[American popular music]], but does have distinctive retentions from traditional Hawaiian music.<ref name=\"Manuel\"/>\n\n=== Hawaiian Renaissance ===\n{{main|Hawaiian Renaissance}}\nThe Hawaiian Renaissance was a resurgence in interest in Hawaiian music, especially slack-key, among ethnic Hawaiians. Long-standing performers like [[Gabby Pahinui]] found their careers revitalized; Pahinui, who had begun recording in 1947, finally reached mainstream audiences across the United States when sessions on which [[Ry Cooder]] played with him and his family were released as ''The Gabby Pahinui Hawaiian Band, Vol. 1'' on a major mainland label. Pahinui inspired a legion of followers who played a mix of slack-key, reggae, country, rock and other styles. The more traditional players included [[Leland Isaacs Sr.|Leland \"Atta\" Isaacs, Sr.]], [[Sonny Chillingworth]], [[Ray Kane]], [[Leonard Kwan]], [[Ledward Ka`apana]], [[Dennis Pavao]], while [[Keola Beamer]] and [[Peter Moon (musician)|Peter Moon]] have been more eclectic in their approach. The Emerson brothers rekindled the classic sound of Sol Ho'opi'i with the National steel guitar on their vintage 1920s stylings. [[George Kanahele]]'s [[Hawaiian Music Foundation]] did much to spread slack-key and other forms of Hawaiian music, especially after a major 1972 concert.<ref name=\"Unterberger\"/>\n\n[[Don Ho]] (1930\u20132007), originally from the small Honolulu neighborhood of Kaka'ako, was the most widely known Hawaiian entertainer of the last decades of the 20th century. Although he did not play \"traditional\" Hawaiian music, Ho became an unofficial ambassador of Hawaiian culture throughout the world as well as on the American mainland. Ho's style often combined traditional Hawaiian elements and older 1950s and 1960s-style crooner music with an easy listening touch.\n\n[[Loyal Garner]] also embraced Hawaiian elements in her Vegas-style lounge act and in the songs she recorded. A third notable performer, [[Myra English]], became known as the \"Champagne Lady\" after recording the song \"Drinking Champagne\" by [[Bill Mack (singer)|Bill Mack]] in 1963 became her signature song in Hawaii, and she achieved considerable commercial success both locally and abroad.\n\n=== Jawaiian ===\n\nJawaiian is a Hawaiian style of [[reggae]] music. Reggae music is a genre that evolved in the late 1960s and earlier in [[Jamaica]]. It has become popular across the world, especially among ethnic groups and races that have been historically oppressed, such as [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], [[Pacific Islanders]], and [[Australian Aborigine]]s. In Hawaii, [[Native Hawaiians|ethnic Hawaiians]] and others in the state began playing a mixture of reggae and local music in the early 1980s, although it was not until the late 1980s that it became recognized as a new genre in local music. The band Simplisity has been credited by [[Quiet Storm Records]] as originators of the Jawaiian style. By the end of the 1980s, Jawaiian came to dominate the local music scene, as well as spawning a backlash that the ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'' compared to the \"[[disco]] sucks\" movement of the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=January 12, 2006 |title='02 not the year Jawaiian dies, but look out|work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin|url=http://starbulletin.com/2002/01/01/features/story2.html}}</ref>\n\nReggae culture as a whole began to dominate Hawaii, as many locals can be seen sporting Bob Marley memorabilia, and lots of local merchandise and souvenirs have been emblazoned with the red, yellow, and green colors of the Hawaiian sovereignty as well as the Lion of Judah flag, a known symbol of the [[Rastafari movement]]. The Rasta colors have also become a symbol of local pride.\n\n=== Rock and Roll ===\n\n[[Rock and Roll]] music has long been popular in Hawaii - numerous rock and roll artists spent their developmental years in Hawaii (i.e. members of [[The Association]], [[The Electric Prunes]], [[7th Order]], [[Vicious Rumors]], as well as guitarists [[Marty Friedman]] and [[Charles Foster Johnson|Charlie \"Icarus\" Johnson]]), and its local popularity dates back to the earliest days of rock music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottymoore.net/honolulu.html|title=Scotty Moore - Honolulu Stadium - Honolulu, HI|website=www.scottymoore.net|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref> [[Elvis Presley]]'s career included several Hawaii-related performances and records: a March 1961 live performance to raise money for the construction of the [[USS Arizona Memorial]] at the [[Pearl Harbor]] Bloch Arena in March 1961,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottymoore.net/blocharena.html|title=Scotty Moore - Bloch Arena And The USS Arizona Memorial|website=www.scottymoore.net|accessdate=7 April 2018}}</ref>  his ''[[Aloha from Hawaii Via Satellite]]'' \"comeback\" record and concert in 1973, and three of his movies were based in Hawaii (''[[Blue Hawaii]]'', ''[[Girls! Girls!

Mihana Souza. Although Hawaiian vocalist [[Melveen Leed]] is known primarily for singing Hawaiian and \"Hawaiian country\" music, she has also earned good reviews as a jazz singer.\n\nThere are frequent performances by the [[University of Hawaii]] jazz bands.\n\n=== Ukulele ===\n{{main|Ukulele}}\nThe [[ukulele]] was introduced to [[Hawaii]] by [[Madeira]]n immigrants near the close of the 19th century. The Portuguese brought a small guitar-like instrument, known as the [[cavaquinho|machete]]. The instrument became a very popular one in Hawaiian culture, and a majority of Hawaiian songs involve the ukulele. In Hawaiian, ukulele literally means \"flea (uku) jumping (lele).\" It was named as such because when plucked, the high pitch of the strings brings to mind the image of a jumping flea. There are currently four sizes of ukulele; soprano, concert, tenor and baritone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fun Facts - The Ukulele|url=http://luaukalamaku.com/kauai_luau_fun_facts_the_ukulele.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413042518/http://luaukalamaku.com/kauai_luau_fun_facts_the_ukulele.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2009-04-13|publisher=Luaukalamaku.com|accessdate=2015-10-26}}</ref>\n\nQueen Liliuokalani, the last Hawaiian Queen, believed that the name for the ukulele means \"The gift that came here\". She believed this because of the Hawaiian words \"uku\" which means \"gift or reward\" and \"lele\" which means \"to come.\"<ref name=\"Pryor, page 18\">Pryor, Alton. Little Known Tales in Hawaii History. Stagecoach Publishing: 2004</ref>\n\nThe ukulele can be played with simple or elaborate strums, as well as [[fingerpicking]].\n\n[[Acacia koa|Koa wood]] is one of the higher quality woods which creates a deep and also clear sound for the ukulele. This makes Koa ukuleles very distinguishable by sound. Because of this, koa wood is known as a revered wood to create an ukulele. Not only are koa ukuleles distinguishable by sound, but also by looks. They have a very unique grain pattern and color that allows them to stand out more than the average wood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-6/Ukulele.html|title=How ukulele is made - production process, manufacture, making, history, used, parts, product, machine, History|website=www.madehow.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-24}}</ref>{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\n\n=== \u2018\u016ak\u0113k\u0113 ===\nThe [[Ukeke]] is a Hawaiian musical bow played with the mouth. It is the only stringed instrument indigenous to Hawaii.\n\n==='Ohe hano ihu===\nThe ''<nowiki>'ohe hano ihu,</nowiki>'' (Hawaiian: `ohe = bamboo +hano = breath + ihu = nose) or Traditional Hawaiian Nose Flute in English, is another type of Hawaiian instrument that has cultural and musical importance. It is made from a single bamboo section. According to ''Arts and Crafts of Hawai`i'' by Te Rangi Hiroa, old flutes in the [[Bishop Museum]] collection have a hole at the node area for the breath, and two or three fingering holes. In the three-finger-hole specimen, one fingering hole is placed near the breath hole. Lengths range from 10\u201321 inches (250\u2013530&nbsp;mm). Oral tradition in various families states that numbers of fingering holes ranged from one to four, and location of the holes varied depending on the musical taste of the player.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Arts and Crafts of Hawai\u02bbi|last=Te Rangi Hiroa|publisher=Bishop Museum Press|year=2003|location=Honolulu, HI|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThough primarily a courting instrument played privately and for personal enjoyment, it also could be used in conjunction with chants, song, and hula. [[Kumu Hula|Kumu hula]] (dance masters), were said to be able to either make the flute sound as though it were chanting, or to chant as they played. Kumu hula Leilehua Yuen is one of the few contemporary Hawaiian musicians to perform with the nose flute in this manner.\n\nInto the 19th and early 20th centuries, young men still used the 'ohe hano ihu as a way to win the affection and love of a woman.<ref name=\"Ranga Pae\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rangapae.com/Nose%20Flute%20page.htm |title=Ohe hano ihu |work=Rangapae.com|date= May 24, 2008 |accessdate=September 13, 2012}}</ref> Today, the `ohe hano ihu is enjoying a resurgence of popularity.\n\nTwo different oral traditions explain the use of the nose for playing the `ohe hano ihu. According to one, the `ohe hano ihu is played with air from the nose rather than from the mouth because a person's'' h\u0101'', breath, is expressive of the person's inner being. As the h\u0101 travels from the ''na`ao'', or gut, through the mouth, the h\u0101 can be used to lie. When the h\u0101 travels through the nose, it cannot lie. Therefore, if a young man loves a woman, that love will be expressed in the music he plays with his `ohe hano ihu. According to the other tradition, the instrument is played with the nose to enable the player to softly sing or chant while playing.\n\nModern folklore says that the Hawaiian flute expresses \"[[aloha]]\" because to hear the flute one must come close to the ''alo'', \"face\" or \"presence\" of the player to hear the ''h\u0101'', \"divine breath\" and so the listener experiences \"being in one another's presence sharing the divine breath.\" While useful as a way to remember the contemplative and personal nature of the traditional Hawaiian flute, there is no actual etymological evidence, nor is there evidence in traditional chants or stories, to support this etymology. In the Hawaiian language, ''h\u0101'', breath, is unrelated to the word ''ha'', a causative prefix. a search of cognate words in related languages also reveals no such etymologies for the word \"aloha\".\n\nAccording to the book ''`Ohe'', by Leilehua Yuen, the instrument was popularized in the 1970s by members of the Beamer family who played it during performances on tour in North America, as well as in the Hawaiian Islands. Segments of the children's educational TV show, Sesame Street, showing Keola Beamer and Mr. Snuffalupagus, one of the large puppet characters, playing `ohe hano ihu brought the instrument to national attention. Winona Beamer, Keola Beamer's mother, a noted kumu hula, also taught the use of the `ohe hano ihu in hula. Her h\u0101nai daughter, Maile Beamer Loo, continues to preserve and teach that legacy, and document such important aspects of Hawaiian musical and performing heritage through the Hula Preservation Society.\n\nNotable late 20th Century and early 21st Century musicians of the`ohe hano ihu include Mahi Beamer, Nona Beamer, Keola Beamer, Kapono Beamer, Calvin Hoe, Nelson Kaai, Anthony Natividad, and Manu Josiah.\n\n=== Other ===\n{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}\nThe music that is considered popular or \"underground\" in Hawaii does not necessarily correspond to similar genres in mainland areas of the U.S.A. This is partly a result of Hawaiian music, which appeals to many generations; in contrast, music like heavy metal or punk rock appeals primarily to a more youthful generation, and is not considered as commercially attractive to tourism. [[Na mele paleoleo]] is an emerging form of Hawaiian rap.\n\nIt is difficult to promote popular acts from the mainland due to its geographical isolation, and the smaller group of people interested in the music.\n\n[[Bruno Mars]] from Honolulu has 6 #1 Billboard Hot 100 hits, including \"[[Uptown Funk]]\" in 2015. [[Yvonne Elliman]], from Honolulu, had a #1 Hot 100 hit with the disco song \"[[If I Can't Have You (Bee Gees song)|If I Can't Have You]]\" from [[Saturday Night Fever]] in 1978. [[Bette Midler]], also from Honolulu, had a #1 Hot 100 hit with \"[[Wind Beneath My Wings]]\" in 1989. [[Glenn Medeiros]] had a #1 Hot 100 hit in 1990 with \"[[She Ain't Worth It]]\" ft. Bobby Brown. [[Tane Cain]], who was raised in Hawaii, had a #37 Hot 100 hit with \"[[Holdin' On]]\" in 1982.\n\n===McDonald's NextNext Music: Sounds That Spark Change===\nIn 2016, [[McDonald's]] of [[Hawaii]] launched the NextNext Music: Sounds That Spark Change competition and charity event that featured 40 Hawaii musicians, bands and artists.

The club plays in the [[Australian Football League]], the sport's premier league.\n\nThe club's name originates from its original home base in the bayside Melbourne suburb of [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]] in which the club was established in 1873. The club also has strong links to the south-eastern suburb of [[Moorabbin, Victoria|Moorabbin]], where it was based between 1965 and 2010.\n\nSt Kilda were a foundation team of the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) in 1877 and later, in 1897, became a foundation team in the [[Victorian Football League (1897\u20131989)|Victorian Football League]] (VFL), which later became known as the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) in 1990.<ref name=\"TheClubs\">{{cite book|title=The Clubs|editor-last1=Ross |editor-first1=John |editor-last2=Hutchinson |editor-first2=Garrie |publisher=Penguin Books |year=1998 |page=321|isbn=978-0-670-87858-1}}</ref> The Saints field teams in the [[AFL Women's]] and [[VFL Women's]] competitions, and are in an alignment with the [[Sandringham Football Club]] in the [[Victorian Football League]].

They made their debut in an away game against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] on 8 May 1897, which they lost 2.4. (16) to 5.11. (41).\n\nThe club's home ground in the new league was the [[Junction Oval]] ( until 1964 ) in the suburb of St Kilda in Melbourne and the club's first home game was against [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]]. The score was St Kilda 3.8. (26) to 10.6. (66).\n\nSt Kilda's early years in the VFL were not successful and, in 1899, they had the lowest score ever recorded in a VFL/AFL match, one point against Geelong (who scored 162).<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie Rules For Dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008) p. 45</ref>\n\nIn 1902, [[Charlie Baker (footballer)|Charlie Baker]] became the first St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 30 goals.\n\n====1907: First finals series====\nSix successive wins at the start of the [[1907 VFL season|1907 season]] saw St Kilda make the finals for the first time, qualifying third with nine wins and eight losses.\n\nSt Kilda were beaten by [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in their first VFL final by 56 points. They qualified in third position again in [[1908 VFL season|1908]] and were once again eliminated by Carlton in the semi-finals, this time by 58 points.\n\n====1913: First grand final====\n[[File:St kilda 1913.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|St Kilda squad for the 1913 Grand Final]]\nThe 1913 season saw major improvement in which the team qualified fourth, but were eventually beaten in the [[1913 VFL Grand Final|1913 grand final]] by Fitzroy. At the time a challenge system was in place, which allowed the team that qualified in first position as minor premiers to challenge any team that won through to be the top ranked team in the finals series if it was not the minor premiers. St Kilda won its semi-final against [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]] and then defeated Fitzroy two weeks later 10.10. (70) to 6.9. (45) in what was a match between the two teams that won the semi-finals. Fitzroy as minor premiers were allowed to challenge St Kilda \u2013 the number one ranked team in the finals series at that point \u2013 and the two teams played again the following week in the grand final which Fitzroy won 7.14.(56) to 5.13.(43).\n\nDue to World War I the St Kilda Football Club was in recess in 1916 and 1917 but resumed in 1918 and fared well, making the finals in fourth position but were eliminated by Collingwood in a semi final by nine points, 58 to 49.\n\n===1918\u20131939: Between the wars===\n\n====1925: First Brownlow medallist====\n[[Colin Watson (footballer)|Colin Watson]] became the first St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the [[Brownlow Medal]].\n\nThe following years saw St Kilda establish itself as a more consistently competitive club. They made the finals in [[1929 VFL season|1929]] and were eliminated once again by [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], 12.9 (81) to 11.7 (73) in the semi-finals.\n\n====1930s====\nIn 1936, [[Bill Mohr]] became the second St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season.\n\nBill Mohr kicked 101 goals in [[1936 VFL season|1936]] and was the first St Kilda player to kick 100 goals or more in a season.\n\nThe mid-1930s saw the club consistently vying for finals berths, finally making it in [[1939 VFL season|1939]] by qualifying fourth after a record run of eight consecutive victories and an overall record of 13 wins and five losses.<ref name=\"saints.com.au\"/>  The team had its first finals win since 1913, against [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]], but were eliminated in the 1939 finals series by Collingwood in the preliminary final.\n\n===1940s and 1950s===\nSt Kilda won three of the first four games early in the [[1940 VFL season|1940 season]] and were on top of the ladder after Round 4 before finishing second last. Although there were some prominent players like [[Harold Bray]], [[Keith Drinan]], [[Peter Bennett (footballer, born 1926)|Peter Bennett]] and later [[Neil Roberts (Australian footballer)|Neil Roberts]], St Kilda were rarely competitive in the 1940s. The [[1950 VFL season|1950 season]] saw St Kilda win the first five games before fading to finish with eight wins and a draw in ninth place. In 1955, after one of the club's worst seasons, [[Alan Killigrew]] was appointed coach.  His first action was one of the largest clean-outs of players in the history of any VFL club. It is believed that only 17 players from 1955 played for St Kilda again in 1956, with 11 new players appearing in the club's opening match of 1956.\n\nIn 1956 [[Bill Young (Australian rules footballer)|Bill Young]] became the third St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 56 goals.\n\n====1957\u20131959: Consecutive Brownlow medallists====\nIn 1957, [[Brian Gleeson (Australian rules footballer)|Brian Gleeson]] became the second St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the Brownlow Medal.\n\nIn 1958, [[Neil Roberts (Australian footballer)|Neil Roberts]] became the third St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal.\n\nAlso in 1958, St Kilda won the [[1958 Night Series Cup|Consolation Night Series competition]], a competition that was played between clubs that had failed to qualify for the premiership season finals series. St Kilda defeated Carlton 16.13 (109) to 15.11 (101) in the final.\n\nIn 1959, [[Verdun Howell]] became the fourth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. Howell had tied with [[Bob Skilton]] in the 1959 Brownlow Medal count. At the time Skilton was awarded the medal on count-back. The league later decided to award a Brownlow Medal to any player who was eligible to win who tied on the same number of votes as a winner who won on count-back \u2013 with Howell receiving a Brownlow retrospectively.\n\nIn 1961, after finishing sixth in 1960, [[Allan Jeans]] was appointed coach. St Kilda qualified for the final four for the first time since 1939, qualifying third with eleven wins and seven losses. However, with fullback Verdun Howell unfit, the club lost to [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]] in the first semi-final.  The club finished ninth in [[1962 VFL season|1962]] with nine wins and nine losses.\n\nIn 1964, St Kilda were defeated in the final of the [[1964 Night Series Cup|Consolation Night Series]] competition by Footscray 11.12 (78) to 11.7 (73).\n\nSt Kilda had a convincing sequence of six consecutive wins in the last six rounds of the [[1963 VFL season|1963 season]] to qualify in fourth position with 13 wins (52 premiership points), two premiership points behind minor premiers [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]. The club lost to [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] in the semi-finals.\n\n===1960\u20131973: Successful era===\n\n===Departure from the Junction Oval===\nBy the late 1950s, the St Kilda Football Club was seeking to move its playing base away from the [[Junction Oval]], frustrated by disputes and relationships with the [[St Kilda Cricket Club]]. In 1959, the club made enquiries about a 50-year lease to play at and develop [[Elsternwick Park]] in the neighbouring suburb of [[Elsternwick, Victoria|Elsternwick]], but no deal was signed.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|date=4 April 1959|page=54|author=Jack Dunn|title=St Kilda to seek new home ground|publication-place=Melbourne}}</ref> In March 1964, the club arranged a deal to move its training and administrative base to the large [[Moorabbin Oval]] in Linton St, [[Moorabbin, Victoria|Moorabbin]], approximately 10&nbsp;km south-east of St Kilda, starting from the [[1965 VFL season|1965 season]].<ref name=\"sun25mar\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne|page=52|author=Jack Dunn|date=25 March 1964|title=Saints will move to Moorabbin in '65}}</ref> The club signed a 75-year lease in August 1964 for controlling occupancy of the venue, and established a social club on the site.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne|page=56|author=Rex Pullen|date=5 August 1964|title=Saints given 75-yr. lease}}</ref> The move cost the local [[Moorabbin Football Club]] its place in the [[Victorian Football Association]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne|page=20|author=Peter Stone|date=4 April 1964|title=V.F.A. suspends Moorabbin for season}}</ref>\n\nSt Kilda's final home game for premiership points at the [[Junction Oval]] was the Round 18 match on 22 August 1964 against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], which St Kilda won 12.18 (90) to 11.12 (78) in front of a crowd of 37,100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/teams/stkilda/allgames_vn.html#6 |title=AFL Tables \u2013 St Kilda All Games \u2013 By Team |publisher=AFL Tables |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> Its first home game at Moorabbin was a 6-point win over Collingwood 8.12 (60) d. 8.6 (54) in front of a crowd of 51,370, which is still the ground record for Moorabbin Oval.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/crowds/vn_moorabbin_oval.html|title=Moorabbin Oval - Attendances (1965\u20131992)|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=14 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1965: First minor premiership===\nSt Kilda finished the home and away season a game clear on top with 14 wins and 4 losses, qualifying for a finals series in first position as minor premiers for the first time in the club's history.\n\nSt Kilda defeated Collingwood in the second semi-final to progress into the grand final. The club finished second in the 1965 premiership season after being beaten by [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] 14.21 (105) to 9.16 (70) in the [[1965 VFL Grand Final]].\n\n[[Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer)|Ian Stewart]] became the fifth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. Stewart tied on votes with [[Noel Teasdale]] of [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and was awarded the 1965 Brownlow on a count-back.\n\n====1966: First premiership====\n{| style=\"margin-right:4px; margin-top:8px; float:right; border:1px #000 solid; border-radius:8px; background:#fff; font-family:Verdana; font-size:8pt; text-align:center;\"\n|-\n| width=200 | ''[[1966 VFL Grand Final]]'' || ''G'' || ''B'' || ''Total''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | St Kilda || '''10''' || '''14''' || '''74'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] || 10 || 13 || 73\n|-\n| Venue: [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]\n| colspan=3 | Crowd: 101,655\n|}\n\n1966 saw St Kilda qualify for finals series in consecutive years for the first time since 1907\u201308. 14 wins and 4 losses in the home and away rounds qualified the club for the finals in second place.\n\nIan Stewart was the first St Kilda player in history to become a dual Brownlow Medalist after winning the 1966 Brownlow Medal with 21 votes. The second consecutive year he won the league's highest individual award and the sixth Brownlow Medal won by a St Kilda player.\n\nSt Kilda were defeated by Collingwood in the second semi-final 15. 9. (99) to 13. 11. (89). The club progressed to the 1966 Grand Final after defeating Essendon in the preliminary final 15. 4. (94) to 7. 10. (52).\n\nSt Kilda went on to defeat Collingwood in the [[1966 VFL Grand Final]] 10.14 (74) to 10.13 (73), winning the club's first ever premiership.\n\n====Late 1960s====\nIn 1967, [[Ross G. Smith|Ross Smith]] became the sixth St Kilda player to win Brownlow Medal.  This was also the third consecutive year that a St Kilda player had won the Brownlow Medal and the second time in the club's history that they had Brownlow Medalists in three consecutive years.\n\nThe [[1968 VFL season|1968 season]] saw St Kilda qualify fourth with 14 wins, 5 losses and a draw. St Kilda were eliminated by Geelong in the first semi-final.\n\n====1970\u20131973: Consecutive finals series====\nA seventh place home and away season finish in [[1969 VFL season|1969]] was followed by another finals appearance in [[1970 VFL season|1970]], when St Kilda qualified in third place with 14 wins and 8 losses.  St Kilda defeated South Melbourne in the first semifinal and went on to be eliminated by eventual premiers [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in the preliminary final.\n\nSt Kilda qualified for the finals series in second place in [[1971 VFL season|1971]] at the end of the home and away season with 16 wins.  St Kilda was defeated by Hawthorn by two points in the second semifinal, defeated Richmond in the preliminary final and was defeated in the [[1971 VFL Grand Final]] by Hawthorn.\n\nThe club qualified for the finals series again in [[1972 VFL season|1972]] in fourth with 14 wins and 8 losses.  St Kilda defeated Essendon in the elimination final and Collingwood in the first semifinal before being eliminated in the preliminary final by Carlton.\n\n[[1973 VFL season|1973]] saw the club qualify for a record fourth consecutive finals series in fifth place with 12 wins.  St Kilda defeated Essendon in the elimination final before being eliminated in the semifinals by Richmond.\n\n[[1974 VFL season|1974]] saw the Saints decline to the lower half of the ladder for the first time since the 1950s, finishing tenth with seven wins.  The club failed to build on competitive seasons in [[1975 VFL season|1975]] and [[1976 VFL season|1976]]. Allan Jeans coaching career at St Kilda ended at the end of the 1976 season after 16 seasons.\n\n[[1978 VFL season|1978]] began and ended strongly, but a mid-season slump saw the club narrowly miss the finals. [[1979 VFL season|1979]] began well with a win over Hawthorn before a run of defeats and finishing a clear last.  Continuing financial pressures and defeats saw the club remain in the bottom three for every season from 1979 to 1986.\n\nIn [[1987 VFL season|1987]], with [[Tony Lockett]] at full forward, St Kilda moved out of the bottom three for the first time since [[1982 VFL season|1982]] with nine wins. Tony Lockett won the [[Coleman Medal]] for leading goalkicker in the home and away season, the fourth St Kilda player to win the league's leading goalkicker award. Lockett became the second St Kilda player to kick more than 100 goals in a season (117).\n\nLockett also became the seventh St Kilda player to win the [[Brownlow Medal]]. He remains the only person in league history to win both the league's best and fairest Brownlow Medal and the league's leading goalkicker Coleman Medal award in the same season.

He is the only person in league history to win the Brownlow, Coleman, club best and fairest and Leigh Matthews Trophy in the same year in 1987.\n\n===1990\u20131999===\nThe league was officially renamed the [[Australian Football League]] prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season.\n\nA competitive [[1991 AFL season]] saw St Kilda qualify for a finals series for the first time since 1973, qualifying fourth at the end of the home and away rounds. St Kilda were defeated by Geelong in the elimination final.\n\nTony Lockett won the Coleman Medal for leading goalkicker in the home and away season in 1991, the first St Kilda player to win the league's leading goalkicker twice.\n\nLockett's 118 goals in 1991 was the third year a St Kilda player had kicked more than 100 goals in a season.\n\nIn a competitive [[1992 AFL season|1992 season]], St Kilda again qualified for the finals series, qualifying sixth at the end of the home and away rounds. \nTony Lockett's 132 goals in 1992 was the fourth year a St Kilda player kicked more than 100 goals in a season.\n\nSt Kilda won its first finals series match since 1973, over Collingwood, before being by eliminated from the 1992 finals series by Footscray in the semi-finals.\n\n====1992: Last home game at Moorabbin====\nThe AFL embarked on a strategy of grounds rationalisation in the early 1990s and, with Moorabbin Oval's facilities ageing, St Kilda opted to take a deal to move home games to [[Waverley Park]] from 1993. The club voted in favour of the move in a weighted vote of members and shareholders by a margin of 8750 to 6555 in July 1992.  The club received $430,000 upfront and $120,000 per year for three years from the AFL's grounds rationalisation funds, which helped to clear some of the club's debt.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne|page=40|author=Patrick Smithers|date=14 July 1992|title=Saints vote for move to Waverley}}</ref> St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at Moorabbin Oval was the Round 20 match on 1 August 1992, an 18-point win over the Fitzroy Lions in front of 27,736.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/teams/stkilda/allgames_vn.html#31 |title=AFL Tables \u2013 St Kilda All Games \u2013 By Team |publisher=AFL Tables |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> St Kilda Football Club retained Moorabbin Oval as a training, administration and entertainment venue.\n\n====1996: First pre-season cup win====\nSt Kilda won the [[1996 Ansett Australia Cup]] competition, the pre-season cup.

St Kilda finished second after being beaten in the [[1997 AFL Grand Final]] by Adelaide.\n\n====1998\u20132000====\nPrior to the start of the [[1998 AFL season|1998 season]], St Kilda progressed to the [[1998 Ansett Australia Cup]] final in which they were defeated by North Melbourne.\n\nSt Kilda made their best start to a season since 1972 by winning five out of six matches by Round 6. At the half-way mark of the 1998 season, St Kilda had jumped to top spot on the ladder in Round 14 with eleven wins and three losses after defeating the Western Bulldogs in a top of the ladder clash at Waverley Park and were tipped as warm favourites for the premiership. However, the team's performance dramatically faded after going from second place in Round 17 to sixth at the home and away games conclusion in Round 22. During this period St Kilda defeated Geelong in Round 16 and West Coast in Round 21. After qualifying for the finals in consecutive seasons, St Kilda were defeated narrowly by Sydney in the qualifying finals and then eliminated comprehensively by Melbourne in the semi-finals. Consolation for the team's performance that year was Robert Harvey becoming the second St Kilda player in history to become a dual Brownlow Medalist after winning the 1998 Brownlow Medal with 32 votes, the highest ever votes at the time. He would also be the second St Kilda player to win consecutive Brownlow Medals and the tenth St Kilda Brownlow Medalist.\n\n;1999 \u2013 Farewell to Waverley Park\nSt Kilda made a good start to the 1999 premiership season after progressing to the top four in Round 10. Their form, however, then faded and by the season's end conclusion they would finish 10th on the ladder. St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at Waverley Park was the Round 20 match on 14 August 1999, a 25-point loss to North Melbourne which ended their chance at a third consecutive finals campaign in a row since 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/teams/stkilda/allgames_vn.html#28 |title=AFL Tables \u2013 St Kilda All Games \u2013 By Team |publisher=AFL Tables |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, St Kilda moved to a new playing home at [[Docklands Stadium]] (currently known by its sponsorship name as Marvel Stadium) whilst maintaining the club's training and administration headquarters at Moorabbin.\n\n===2000\u20132008: From wooden spoon to finals===\n\n====2000\u20132003====\nThe Saints struggled in the early part of this decade, winning only two matches and drawing one to finish with the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]] in [[2000 AFL season|2000]]. They did not fare well in [[2001 AFL season|2001]] or [[2002 AFL season|2002]] either, finishing second-last in both seasons; the time spent at the bottom allowed St Kilda to recruit players such as [[Justin Koschitzke]], [[Nick Riewoldt]], [[Nick Dal Santo]] and [[Brendon Goddard]], who were mainstays of the team over the following decade. The 2003 season saw a much improved Saints outfit, finishing 11th at the season's end.

ladder, just missing out on the finals for the first time since 2007.\n\n====2013\u20132019: Rebuilding under Watters and Richardson ====\n{{Main|2013 St Kilda Football Club season}}\nThe 2013 season marked a historic moment for the St Kilda Football Club and the AFL with the first home and away season match outside of Australia. The match was held in Wellington, New Zealand, on 25 April ([[Anzac Day]]), the day each year on which both Australia and New Zealand commemorate the soldiers from both countries who have fought in conflicts around the world.\n\nThe match began in the early evening and was held at Westpac Trust Stadium with the Saints hosting the Sydney Swans. The match was played in frigid and slippery conditions. The Saints lost the match by 16 points.\n\nIn Round 23, St Kilda hosted Fremantle in what would be the last game for three 200 game players, [[Stephen Milne]], [[Jason Blake (footballer)|Jason Blake]] and [[Justin Koschitzke]]. The Saints won by 71 points.\n\nSt Kilda won five matches for the year and finished 16th on the ladder. On 1 November, senior coach [[Scott Watters]] was sacked. On 14 November, former Port Adelaide director of coaching [[Alan Richardson (footballer, born 1965)|Alan Richardson]] was announced as new senior coach for the next three years. In the off-season, the Saints trading negotiations resulted in the arrival of [[Shane Savage]], [[Luke Delaney]], [[Josh Bruce]] and [[Billy Longer]], while also picking up draft picks 3, 18 and 19, which were used to take [[Jack Billings]], [[Luke Dunstan]] and Blake Acres respectively.\n\nSt Kilda began 2014 under new coach Richardson with a 17-point win over favourites Melbourne. They followed this with a win over the [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] to start the season 2-0 for the first time since 2010. After a close loss to West Coast and a heavy defeat to Adelaide, the Saints managed to upset top eight favourites Essendon by 16 points. Following this, the Saints lost the next 11 games, including losses by over 80 points to Hawthorn, Collingwood, Geelong and Carlton. On 15 July, [[Lenny Hayes]] announced that he would retire at the end of the 2014 season. The following weekend, the Saints beat Fremantle by 58 points at Etihad Stadium in the upset of the season. The Saints then lost the remaining five games to end the season with 4 wins and 18 losses as well as their first wooden spoon since 2000. With pick one in the draft, St Kilda selected key forward [[Patrick McCartin]].\n\nIn 2015, the club still struggled to compete with the higher echelons of the competition, however, the team still showed its potential with an eleven-goal comeback against the Western Bulldogs a particular highlight, as well as the emergence of key forward [[Josh Bruce]], who finished the year with 50 goals. 2016 saw the club begin to challenge for the top 8, however despite gaining twelve wins (including victories against Geelong and eventual premiers the Western Bulldogs) and the continued development of the club's young stars, St Kilda finished ninth on the AFL ladder, missing the finals on percentage.\n\nIn 2017, St Kilda once again challenged for a spot in the top 8, highlighted by their Round 16 victory over eventual premiers Richmond, in which they recorded an 82-point margin at half time, leading 14.8 (92) to 1.4 (10) before running away to a comfortable 21.12 (138) to 10.11 (71) win. However, after a mid season dip in form which saw them lose three games in a row by over six goals to the Sydney Swans (50 points), the Western Bulldogs (40 points) and the Adelaide Crows (57 points), coupled with late season losses to Melbourne and Richmond, St Kilda's finals chances were dismissed, eventually leading to the Saints finishing the season at 11th place on the ladder with 11 wins and 11 losses. 2017 also ended with the retirements of club greats [[Nick Riewoldt]] (336 games), [[Leigh Montagna]] (282 games) and [[Sean Dempster]] (222 games for Sydney and St Kilda).\n\nThe 2018 season saw a drastic fall in the club's form, as the Saints tumbled to 16th place on the ladder with four wins and a draw. Increased scrutiny on Richardson as coach saw the club bring experienced assistants [[Brett Ratten]] and [[Brendon Lade]] to Moorabbin, along with NRL legend [[Billy Slater]] in a leadership role. While 2019 started brightly with four wins from the first five games, the Saints eventually suffered a similar dip in form to the previous year, losing 9 of the next 11 matches. After being advised that his contract would not be renewed for 2020, coach [[Alan Richardson (footballer, born 1965)|Alan Richardson]] resigned from his position as senior coach. Ratten took over as caretaker coach and, after winning three of the season's last six games, was appointed permanent senior coach in September 2019.\n\n==== 2019-present: Ratten era ====\n{{Main|2020 St Kilda Football Club season}}\nDespite the coaching change, the Saints ended the 2019 season positively with four high-profile players requesting a trade to the Saints and many discussions held with other players looking to move.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/saints-are-the-ones-to-watch-this-trade-period-20191008-p52ytz.html|title=Saints are the ones to watch this trade period|last=Niall|first=Jake|date=2019-10-08|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> During the trade period St Kilda traded a number of picks and acquired Port Adelaide's [[Dougal Howard]] and [[Paddy Ryder]], [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle's]] [[Bradley Hill (footballer)|Bradley Hill]], [[Zak Jones]] from [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] and [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond's]] [[Dan Butler (Australian footballer)|Dan Butler]].<nowiki/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.afl.com.au/news/2019-10-15/saints-double-delight-power-pair-off-to-moorabbin|title=Saints' double delight: Power pair off to Moorabbin|website=afl.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/over-the-hill-saints-travel-acres-to-get-the-deal-done-20191016-p531dd.html|title=Over the Hill: Saints travel Acres to get the deal done|last=McClure|first=Sam|date=2019-10-16|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> [[Jack Steven]], [[Josh Bruce]] and [[Blake Acres]] were traded to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], [[Western Bulldogs]] and [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Saints also added to their football department with former player Sean Dempster joining as a fitness coach, while former Hawthorn legend [[Jarryd Roughead]] as well as David Rath and [[Ben Robbins]] also moved to the club.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saints.com.au/news/2019-09-19/saints-bolster-football-department|title=Saints bolster football department|website=saints.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Club identity==\nThe club's on-field nickname is the '''Saints''', usage of which dates back to as early as the 1870s.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The South Australian Advertiser|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=21 August 1877|page=7|title=Football}}</ref> Many clubs' early nicknames was derived from an abbreviation or demonym of the club's suburb, but St Kilda is unique among the AFL clubs in now utilising this as its official nickname.

In the club's early years, from 1873 to 1896, the players wore a thinly striped red, white and black jumper; the stripes were later widened. In 1915, St Kilda changed its colours to red, yellow and black, to avoid playing in the colours of the [[German Empire|German Empire's flag]] during a war against that country;<ref>{{cite news|title=Weekly Times|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/121124670?searchTerm=%22st%20kilda%22%20%22yellow%22%20%22football%22&searchLimits=sortby=dateDesc|date=17 April 1915|pages=21}}</ref> in honour of allied power Belgium, they played in [[Flag of Belgium|its flag colours]] for the remainder of the First World War.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Australasian|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/142971657?searchTerm=%22st%20kilda%22%20%22yellow%22%20%22football%22&searchLimits=sortby=dateDesc|date=17 April 1915|page=26}}</ref> In 1923 the club returned to using the club's original colours of red, white and black.\n\nThe St Kilda Football Club crest first appeared officially on the jumper in approximately 1933 after existing at the club for quite some time beforehand in basic design form. In 1953 the Saints' jumper took on a \"vest\" style of the three stripes; red, white and black on the front with the club crest, and a plain black back with white numbers \u2013 which is used today. The most common variation on that basic design through the years has been the ribbing area around the sleeves and neck having various alternative designs. For a period from 1997 to 2001, a stylised jumper based on the club crest itself was worn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footyjumpers.com |title=www.footyjumpers.com |publisher=www.footyjumpers.com |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Evolution====\nUniforms worn by St Kilda through its history:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.footyjumpers.com/|title=History of VFL/AFL Jumpers|website=FootyJumpers.com}}</ref>\n\n{|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _red_black_3|pattern_so= _hoops_black|body= ffffff|shorts= 062A56|socks= ff0000|title= 1897\u20131909}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _red_black_3|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1910\u201314}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _red_black_3|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffcc00|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1915\u201318 }}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _stkilda 1919|pattern_so= _redtop|body= 000000|shorts= ffffff|socks= 000000|title= 1919\u201322}}\n|-\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _stkilda 1923|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1923\u201352}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redwhiteblack|pattern_so= _hoops_black_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 1953\u201396}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _stkilda 1997|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1997\u20132001}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redwhiteblack|pattern_so= _hoops_black_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 2002\u2013present}}\n|}\n\nThe St Kilda jumper has three vertical stripes of red, white and black on the front with the club crest a plain black back with white ribbing and numbers.

The league did not use official club logos until approximately the 1970s. Prior to the 1970s logos were generally created by clubs and in some cases outside companies for sales of merchandise but were in no way official ( or registered trademarks in some cases ). In the past all the club logos were printed in the same basic design frame ( in the form of a badge or shield shape ) and had each club's individual colours, name and design in them. St Kilda used several different logos, including some featuring the stick figure in the 1980s and 1990s. Shortly after the league officially changed its name to the AFL prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season, the club used a logo with a red white and black vertically striped design with the goal and behind posts on it, with a stick figure attempting a mark on it with a halo above its head, with the league logo and the club crest on top of either behind post.\n\n====Club crest as the official logo====\nA logo change before the start of the 1995 season saw the club make the decision to use the official club crest \u2013 which has been on the club jumper since it was first designed in the 1930s and was already an officially registered trade mark of the club \u2013 as the club's official logo in the league. The crest is an iconic feature of the club's jumper \u2013 a well-known and recognisable symbol of the club. The crest also includes the club's motto, ''Fortius Quo Fidelius'', which is usually translated as \"Strength through loyalty\". As with the nickname \"Saints\" the club crest has no religious associations.\n\n===Club song===\nThe club song is an adaption of \"When The Saints Go Marching In\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footy.com.au/dags/songs/saints.html |title=St Kilda Saints Club Song |publisher=Footy.com.au |date=28 April 1998 |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> The song was recorded in 1972 by the Fable Singers and released as a single.

As part of the development deal the parkland outside the outer side of the oval (behind the old terraces that were on the outer side of the ground) is no longer leased by St Kilda FC and has been released back to the local council. It will serve as the primary home ground for the [[Sandringham Dragons]] and the [[Southern Football League (Victoria)|Southern Football League]] as well as being the administrative centre for football development in the south-east.

From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a [[reserve team|reserves competition]] and, from 1992 to 1999, a ''de facto'' AFL reserves competition was run by the [[Victorian State Football League]]. St Kilda fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for St Kilda in the lower grade. During that time, the St Kilda reserves team won three premierships (1942, 1943 and 1961). Following the demise of the AFL reserves competition, the St Kilda reserves team competed in the new [[Victorian Football League]] in the 2000 season before the team was dissolved at the end of the year.\n\nIn 2001, St Kilda entered a [[Australian Football League reserves affiliations|reserves affiliation]] with existing VFL club [[Springvale Football Club|Springvale]] (which moved to Cranbourne and was renamed [[Casey Scorpions|Casey]] in 2006).

They made their debut in an away game against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] on 8 May 1897, which they lost 2.4. (16) to 5.11. (41).\n\nThe club's home ground in the new league was the [[Junction Oval]] ( until 1964 ) in the suburb of St Kilda in Melbourne and the club's first home game was against [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]]. The score was St Kilda 3.8. (26) to 10.6. (66).\n\nSt Kilda's early years in the VFL were not successful and, in 1899, they had the lowest score ever recorded in a VFL/AFL match, one point against Geelong (who scored 162).<ref>[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie Rules For Dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008) p. 45</ref>\n\nIn 1902, [[Charlie Baker (footballer)|Charlie Baker]] became the first St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 30 goals.\n\n====1907: First finals series====\nSix successive wins at the start of the [[1907 VFL season|1907 season]] saw St Kilda make the finals for the first time, qualifying third with nine wins and eight losses.\n\nSt Kilda were beaten by [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in their first VFL final by 56 points. They qualified in third position again in [[1908 VFL season|1908]] and were once again eliminated by Carlton in the semi-finals, this time by 58 points.\n\n====1913: First grand final====\n[[File:St kilda 1913.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|St Kilda squad for the 1913 Grand Final]]\nThe 1913 season saw major improvement in which the team qualified fourth, but were eventually beaten in the [[1913 VFL Grand Final|1913 grand final]] by Fitzroy. At the time a challenge system was in place, which allowed the team that qualified in first position as minor premiers to challenge any team that won through to be the top ranked team in the finals series if it was not the minor premiers. St Kilda won its semi-final against [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]] and then defeated Fitzroy two weeks later 10.10. (70) to 6.9. (45) in what was a match between the two teams that won the semi-finals. Fitzroy as minor premiers were allowed to challenge St Kilda \u2013 the number one ranked team in the finals series at that point \u2013 and the two teams played again the following week in the grand final which Fitzroy won 7.14.(56) to 5.13.(43).\n\nDue to World War I the St Kilda Football Club was in recess in 1916 and 1917 but resumed in 1918 and fared well, making the finals in fourth position but were eliminated by Collingwood in a semi final by nine points, 58 to 49.\n\n===1918\u20131939: Between the wars===\n\n====1925: First Brownlow medallist====\n[[Colin Watson (footballer)|Colin Watson]] became the first St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the [[Brownlow Medal]].\n\nThe following years saw St Kilda establish itself as a more consistently competitive club. They made the finals in [[1929 VFL season|1929]] and were eliminated once again by [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], 12.9 (81) to 11.7 (73) in the semi-finals.\n\n====1930s====\nIn 1936, [[Bill Mohr]] became the second St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season.\n\nBill Mohr kicked 101 goals in [[1936 VFL season|1936]] and was the first St Kilda player to kick 100 goals or more in a season.\n\nThe mid-1930s saw the club consistently vying for finals berths, finally making it in [[1939 VFL season|1939]] by qualifying fourth after a record run of eight consecutive victories and an overall record of 13 wins and five losses.<ref name=\"saints.com.au\"/>  The team had its first finals win since 1913, against [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]], but were eliminated in the 1939 finals series by Collingwood in the preliminary final.\n\n===1940s and 1950s===\nSt Kilda won three of the first four games early in the [[1940 VFL season|1940 season]] and were on top of the ladder after Round 4 before finishing second last. Although there were some prominent players like [[Harold Bray]], [[Keith Drinan]], [[Peter Bennett (footballer, born 1926)|Peter Bennett]] and later [[Neil Roberts (Australian footballer)|Neil Roberts]], St Kilda were rarely competitive in the 1940s. The [[1950 VFL season|1950 season]] saw St Kilda win the first five games before fading to finish with eight wins and a draw in ninth place. In 1955, after one of the club's worst seasons, [[Alan Killigrew]] was appointed coach.  His first action was one of the largest clean-outs of players in the history of any VFL club. It is believed that only 17 players from 1955 played for St Kilda again in 1956, with 11 new players appearing in the club's opening match of 1956.\n\nIn 1956 [[Bill Young (Australian rules footballer)|Bill Young]] became the third St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 56 goals.\n\n====1957\u20131959: Consecutive Brownlow medallists====\nIn 1957, [[Brian Gleeson (Australian rules footballer)|Brian Gleeson]] became the second St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the Brownlow Medal.\n\nIn 1958, [[Neil Roberts (Australian footballer)|Neil Roberts]] became the third St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal.\n\nAlso in 1958, St Kilda won the [[1958 Night Series Cup|Consolation Night Series competition]], a competition that was played between clubs that had failed to qualify for the premiership season finals series. St Kilda defeated Carlton 16.13 (109) to 15.11 (101) in the final.\n\nIn 1959, [[Verdun Howell]] became the fourth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. Howell had tied with [[Bob Skilton]] in the 1959 Brownlow Medal count. At the time Skilton was awarded the medal on count-back. The league later decided to award a Brownlow Medal to any player who was eligible to win who tied on the same number of votes as a winner who won on count-back \u2013 with Howell receiving a Brownlow retrospectively.\n\nIn 1961, after finishing sixth in 1960, [[Allan Jeans]] was appointed coach. St Kilda qualified for the final four for the first time since 1939, qualifying third with eleven wins and seven losses. However, with fullback Verdun Howell unfit, the club lost to [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]] in the first semi-final.  The club finished ninth in [[1962 VFL season|1962]] with nine wins and nine losses.\n\nIn 1964, St Kilda were defeated in the final of the [[1964 Night Series Cup|Consolation Night Series]] competition by Footscray 11.12 (78) to 11.7 (73).\n\nSt Kilda had a convincing sequence of six consecutive wins in the last six rounds of the [[1963 VFL season|1963 season]] to qualify in fourth position with 13 wins (52 premiership points), two premiership points behind minor premiers [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]. The club lost to [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] in the semi-finals.\n\n===1960\u20131973: Successful era===\n\n===Departure from the Junction Oval===\nBy the late 1950s, the St Kilda Football Club was seeking to move its playing base away from the [[Junction Oval]], frustrated by disputes and relationships with the [[St Kilda Cricket Club]]. In 1959, the club made enquiries about a 50-year lease to play at and develop [[Elsternwick Park]] in the neighbouring suburb of [[Elsternwick, Victoria|Elsternwick]], but no deal was signed.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|date=4 April 1959|page=54|author=Jack Dunn|title=St Kilda to seek new home ground|publication-place=Melbourne}}</ref> In March 1964, the club arranged a deal to move its training and administrative base to the large [[Moorabbin Oval]] in Linton St, [[Moorabbin, Victoria|Moorabbin]], approximately 10&nbsp;km south-east of St Kilda, starting from the [[1965 VFL season|1965 season]].<ref name=\"sun25mar\">{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne|page=52|author=Jack Dunn|date=25 March 1964|title=Saints will move to Moorabbin in '65}}</ref> The club signed a 75-year lease in August 1964 for controlling occupancy of the venue, and established a social club on the site.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne|page=56|author=Rex Pullen|date=5 August 1964|title=Saints given 75-yr. lease}}</ref> The move cost the local [[Moorabbin Football Club]] its place in the [[Victorian Football Association]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne|page=20|author=Peter Stone|date=4 April 1964|title=V.F.A. suspends Moorabbin for season}}</ref>\n\nSt Kilda's final home game for premiership points at the [[Junction Oval]] was the Round 18 match on 22 August 1964 against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], which St Kilda won 12.18 (90) to 11.12 (78) in front of a crowd of 37,100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/teams/stkilda/allgames_vn.html#6 |title=AFL Tables \u2013 St Kilda All Games \u2013 By Team |publisher=AFL Tables |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> Its first home game at Moorabbin was a 6-point win over Collingwood 8.12 (60) d. 8.6 (54) in front of a crowd of 51,370, which is still the ground record for Moorabbin Oval.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/crowds/vn_moorabbin_oval.html|title=Moorabbin Oval - Attendances (1965\u20131992)|publisher=AFL Tables|accessdate=14 December 2013}}</ref>\n\n===1965: First minor premiership===\nSt Kilda finished the home and away season a game clear on top with 14 wins and 4 losses, qualifying for a finals series in first position as minor premiers for the first time in the club's history.\n\nSt Kilda defeated Collingwood in the second semi-final to progress into the grand final. The club finished second in the 1965 premiership season after being beaten by [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] 14.21 (105) to 9.16 (70) in the [[1965 VFL Grand Final]].\n\n[[Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer)|Ian Stewart]] became the fifth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal.

The second consecutive year he won the league's highest individual award and the sixth Brownlow Medal won by a St Kilda player.\n\nSt Kilda were defeated by Collingwood in the second semi-final 15. 9. (99) to 13. 11. (89). The club progressed to the 1966 Grand Final after defeating Essendon in the preliminary final 15. 4. (94) to 7. 10.

Smith|Ross Smith]] became the sixth St Kilda player to win Brownlow Medal.  This was also the third consecutive year that a St Kilda player had won the Brownlow Medal and the second time in the club's history that they had Brownlow Medalists in three consecutive years.\n\nThe [[1968 VFL season|1968 season]] saw St Kilda qualify fourth with 14 wins, 5 losses and a draw. St Kilda were eliminated by Geelong in the first semi-final.\n\n====1970\u20131973: Consecutive finals series====\nA seventh place home and away season finish in [[1969 VFL season|1969]] was followed by another finals appearance in [[1970 VFL season|1970]], when St Kilda qualified in third place with 14 wins and 8 losses.  St Kilda defeated South Melbourne in the first semifinal and went on to be eliminated by eventual premiers [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in the preliminary final.\n\nSt Kilda qualified for the finals series in second place in [[1971 VFL season|1971]] at the end of the home and away season with 16 wins.  St Kilda was defeated by Hawthorn by two points in the second semifinal, defeated Richmond in the preliminary final and was defeated in the [[1971 VFL Grand Final]] by Hawthorn.\n\nThe club qualified for the finals series again in [[1972 VFL season|1972]] in fourth with 14 wins and 8 losses.  St Kilda defeated Essendon in the elimination final and Collingwood in the first semifinal before being eliminated in the preliminary final by Carlton.\n\n[[1973 VFL season|1973]] saw the club qualify for a record fourth consecutive finals series in fifth place with 12 wins.  St Kilda defeated Essendon in the elimination final before being eliminated in the semifinals by Richmond.\n\n[[1974 VFL season|1974]] saw the Saints decline to the lower half of the ladder for the first time since the 1950s, finishing tenth with seven wins.  The club failed to build on competitive seasons in [[1975 VFL season|1975]] and [[1976 VFL season|1976]]. Allan Jeans coaching career at St Kilda ended at the end of the 1976 season after 16 seasons.\n\n[[1978 VFL season|1978]] began and ended strongly, but a mid-season slump saw the club narrowly miss the finals. [[1979 VFL season|1979]] began well with a win over Hawthorn before a run of defeats and finishing a clear last.  Continuing financial pressures and defeats saw the club remain in the bottom three for every season from 1979 to 1986.\n\nIn [[1987 VFL season|1987]], with [[Tony Lockett]] at full forward, St Kilda moved out of the bottom three for the first time since [[1982 VFL season|1982]] with nine wins. Tony Lockett won the [[Coleman Medal]] for leading goalkicker in the home and away season, the fourth St Kilda player to win the league's leading goalkicker award. Lockett became the second St Kilda player to kick more than 100 goals in a season (117).\n\nLockett also became the seventh St Kilda player to win the [[Brownlow Medal]]. He remains the only person in league history to win both the league's best and fairest Brownlow Medal and the league's leading goalkicker Coleman Medal award in the same season. Lockett also won St Kilda's best and fairest award, now called the [[Trevor Barker Award]], and the Leigh Matthews Trophy (players association most valuable player) in the same year. He is the only person in league history to win the Brownlow, Coleman, club best and fairest and Leigh Matthews Trophy in the same year in 1987.\n\n===1990\u20131999===\nThe league was officially renamed the [[Australian Football League]] prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season.\n\nA competitive [[1991 AFL season]] saw St Kilda qualify for a finals series for the first time since 1973, qualifying fourth at the end of the home and away rounds. St Kilda were defeated by Geelong in the elimination final.\n\nTony Lockett won the Coleman Medal for leading goalkicker in the home and away season in 1991, the first St Kilda player to win the league's leading goalkicker twice.\n\nLockett's 118 goals in 1991 was the third year a St Kilda player had kicked more than 100 goals in a season.\n\nIn a competitive [[1992 AFL season|1992 season]], St Kilda again qualified for the finals series, qualifying sixth at the end of the home and away rounds. \nTony Lockett's 132 goals in 1992 was the fourth year a St Kilda player kicked more than 100 goals in a season.\n\nSt Kilda won its first finals series match since 1973, over Collingwood, before being by eliminated from the 1992 finals series by Footscray in the semi-finals.\n\n====1992: Last home game at Moorabbin====\nThe AFL embarked on a strategy of grounds rationalisation in the early 1990s and, with Moorabbin Oval's facilities ageing, St Kilda opted to take a deal to move home games to [[Waverley Park]] from 1993. The club voted in favour of the move in a weighted vote of members and shareholders by a margin of 8750 to 6555 in July 1992.  The club received $430,000 upfront and $120,000 per year for three years from the AFL's grounds rationalisation funds, which helped to clear some of the club's debt.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age|publication-place=Melbourne|page=40|author=Patrick Smithers|date=14 July 1992|title=Saints vote for move to Waverley}}</ref> St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at Moorabbin Oval was the Round 20 match on 1 August 1992, an 18-point win over the Fitzroy Lions in front of 27,736.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/teams/stkilda/allgames_vn.html#31 |title=AFL Tables \u2013 St Kilda All Games \u2013 By Team |publisher=AFL Tables |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> St Kilda Football Club retained Moorabbin Oval as a training, administration and entertainment venue.\n\n====1996: First pre-season cup win====\nSt Kilda won the [[1996 Ansett Australia Cup]] competition, the pre-season cup.

St Kilda finished second after being beaten in the [[1997 AFL Grand Final]] by Adelaide.\n\n====1998\u20132000====\nPrior to the start of the [[1998 AFL season|1998 season]], St Kilda progressed to the [[1998 Ansett Australia Cup]] final in which they were defeated by North Melbourne.\n\nSt Kilda made their best start to a season since 1972 by winning five out of six matches by Round 6. At the half-way mark of the 1998 season, St Kilda had jumped to top spot on the ladder in Round 14 with eleven wins and three losses after defeating the Western Bulldogs in a top of the ladder clash at Waverley Park and were tipped as warm favourites for the premiership. However, the team's performance dramatically faded after going from second place in Round 17 to sixth at the home and away games conclusion in Round 22. During this period St Kilda defeated Geelong in Round 16 and West Coast in Round 21. After qualifying for the finals in consecutive seasons, St Kilda were defeated narrowly by Sydney in the qualifying finals and then eliminated comprehensively by Melbourne in the semi-finals. Consolation for the team's performance that year was Robert Harvey becoming the second St Kilda player in history to become a dual Brownlow Medalist after winning the 1998 Brownlow Medal with 32 votes, the highest ever votes at the time. He would also be the second St Kilda player to win consecutive Brownlow Medals and the tenth St Kilda Brownlow Medalist.\n\n;1999 \u2013 Farewell to Waverley Park\nSt Kilda made a good start to the 1999 premiership season after progressing to the top four in Round 10. Their form, however, then faded and by the season's end conclusion they would finish 10th on the ladder. St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at Waverley Park was the Round 20 match on 14 August 1999, a 25-point loss to North Melbourne which ended their chance at a third consecutive finals campaign in a row since 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://afltables.com/afl/teams/stkilda/allgames_vn.html#28 |title=AFL Tables \u2013 St Kilda All Games \u2013 By Team |publisher=AFL Tables |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2000, St Kilda moved to a new playing home at [[Docklands Stadium]] (currently known by its sponsorship name as Marvel Stadium) whilst maintaining the club's training and administration headquarters at Moorabbin.\n\n===2000\u20132008: From wooden spoon to finals===\n\n====2000\u20132003====\nThe Saints struggled in the early part of this decade, winning only two matches and drawing one to finish with the [[wooden spoon (award)|wooden spoon]] in [[2000 AFL season|2000]]. They did not fare well in [[2001 AFL season|2001]] or [[2002 AFL season|2002]] either, finishing second-last in both seasons; the time spent at the bottom allowed St Kilda to recruit players such as [[Justin Koschitzke]], [[Nick Riewoldt]], [[Nick Dal Santo]] and [[Brendon Goddard]], who were mainstays of the team over the following decade. The 2003 season saw a much improved Saints outfit, finishing 11th at the season's end. They scored a notable five-point victory over the eventual three-time premiers [[Brisbane Lions|Brisbane]] in Round 11.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2003-06-07/saints-shock-lions-swans-defuse-bombers/1866940 Saints shock Lions, Swans defuse Bombers - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation)]</ref>\n\n====2004: Second pre-season cup win====\n{{Main|2004 St Kilda Football Club season}}\n2004 began with the club winning the [[2004 Wizard Home Loans Cup]].

ladder, just missing out on the finals for the first time since 2007.\n\n====2013\u20132019: Rebuilding under Watters and Richardson ====\n{{Main|2013 St Kilda Football Club season}}\nThe 2013 season marked a historic moment for the St Kilda Football Club and the AFL with the first home and away season match outside of Australia. The match was held in Wellington, New Zealand, on 25 April ([[Anzac Day]]), the day each year on which both Australia and New Zealand commemorate the soldiers from both countries who have fought in conflicts around the world.\n\nThe match began in the early evening and was held at Westpac Trust Stadium with the Saints hosting the Sydney Swans. The match was played in frigid and slippery conditions. The Saints lost the match by 16 points.\n\nIn Round 23, St Kilda hosted Fremantle in what would be the last game for three 200 game players, [[Stephen Milne]], [[Jason Blake (footballer)|Jason Blake]] and [[Justin Koschitzke]]. The Saints won by 71 points.\n\nSt Kilda won five matches for the year and finished 16th on the ladder. On 1 November, senior coach [[Scott Watters]] was sacked. On 14 November, former Port Adelaide director of coaching [[Alan Richardson (footballer, born 1965)|Alan Richardson]] was announced as new senior coach for the next three years. In the off-season, the Saints trading negotiations resulted in the arrival of [[Shane Savage]], [[Luke Delaney]], [[Josh Bruce]] and [[Billy Longer]], while also picking up draft picks 3, 18 and 19, which were used to take [[Jack Billings]], [[Luke Dunstan]] and Blake Acres respectively.\n\nSt Kilda began 2014 under new coach Richardson with a 17-point win over favourites Melbourne. They followed this with a win over the [[Greater Western Sydney Giants|GWS Giants]] to start the season 2-0 for the first time since 2010. After a close loss to West Coast and a heavy defeat to Adelaide, the Saints managed to upset top eight favourites Essendon by 16 points. Following this, the Saints lost the next 11 games, including losses by over 80 points to Hawthorn, Collingwood, Geelong and Carlton. On 15 July, [[Lenny Hayes]] announced that he would retire at the end of the 2014 season. The following weekend, the Saints beat Fremantle by 58 points at Etihad Stadium in the upset of the season. The Saints then lost the remaining five games to end the season with 4 wins and 18 losses as well as their first wooden spoon since 2000. With pick one in the draft, St Kilda selected key forward [[Patrick McCartin]].\n\nIn 2015, the club still struggled to compete with the higher echelons of the competition, however, the team still showed its potential with an eleven-goal comeback against the Western Bulldogs a particular highlight, as well as the emergence of key forward [[Josh Bruce]], who finished the year with 50 goals. 2016 saw the club begin to challenge for the top 8, however despite gaining twelve wins (including victories against Geelong and eventual premiers the Western Bulldogs) and the continued development of the club's young stars, St Kilda finished ninth on the AFL ladder, missing the finals on percentage.\n\nIn 2017, St Kilda once again challenged for a spot in the top 8, highlighted by their Round 16 victory over eventual premiers Richmond, in which they recorded an 82-point margin at half time, leading 14.8 (92) to 1.4 (10) before running away to a comfortable 21.12 (138) to 10.11 (71) win. However, after a mid season dip in form which saw them lose three games in a row by over six goals to the Sydney Swans (50 points), the Western Bulldogs (40 points) and the Adelaide Crows (57 points), coupled with late season losses to Melbourne and Richmond, St Kilda's finals chances were dismissed, eventually leading to the Saints finishing the season at 11th place on the ladder with 11 wins and 11 losses. 2017 also ended with the retirements of club greats [[Nick Riewoldt]] (336 games), [[Leigh Montagna]] (282 games) and [[Sean Dempster]] (222 games for Sydney and St Kilda).\n\nThe 2018 season saw a drastic fall in the club's form, as the Saints tumbled to 16th place on the ladder with four wins and a draw. Increased scrutiny on Richardson as coach saw the club bring experienced assistants [[Brett Ratten]] and [[Brendon Lade]] to Moorabbin, along with NRL legend [[Billy Slater]] in a leadership role. While 2019 started brightly with four wins from the first five games, the Saints eventually suffered a similar dip in form to the previous year, losing 9 of the next 11 matches. After being advised that his contract would not be renewed for 2020, coach [[Alan Richardson (footballer, born 1965)|Alan Richardson]] resigned from his position as senior coach. Ratten took over as caretaker coach and, after winning three of the season's last six games, was appointed permanent senior coach in September 2019.\n\n==== 2019-present: Ratten era ====\n{{Main|2020 St Kilda Football Club season}}\nDespite the coaching change, the Saints ended the 2019 season positively with four high-profile players requesting a trade to the Saints and many discussions held with other players looking to move.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/saints-are-the-ones-to-watch-this-trade-period-20191008-p52ytz.html|title=Saints are the ones to watch this trade period|last=Niall|first=Jake|date=2019-10-08|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref> During the trade period St Kilda traded a number of picks and acquired Port Adelaide's [[Dougal Howard]] and [[Paddy Ryder]], [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle's]] [[Bradley Hill (footballer)|Bradley Hill]], [[Zak Jones]] from [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]] and [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond's]] [[Dan Butler (Australian footballer)|Dan Butler]].<nowiki/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.afl.com.au/news/2019-10-15/saints-double-delight-power-pair-off-to-moorabbin|title=Saints' double delight: Power pair off to Moorabbin|website=afl.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-10-15}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/afl/over-the-hill-saints-travel-acres-to-get-the-deal-done-20191016-p531dd.html|title=Over the Hill: Saints travel Acres to get the deal done|last=McClure|first=Sam|date=2019-10-16|website=The Age|language=en|access-date=2019-10-19}}</ref> [[Jack Steven]], [[Josh Bruce]] and [[Blake Acres]] were traded to [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]], [[Western Bulldogs]] and [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle]] respectively.<ref name=\":0\" /> The Saints also added to their football department with former player Sean Dempster joining as a fitness coach, while former Hawthorn legend [[Jarryd Roughead]] as well as David Rath and [[Ben Robbins]] also moved to the club.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.saints.com.au/news/2019-09-19/saints-bolster-football-department|title=Saints bolster football department|website=saints.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-10-10}}</ref>\n\n==Club identity==\nThe club's on-field nickname is the '''Saints''', usage of which dates back to as early as the 1870s.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The South Australian Advertiser|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=21 August 1877|page=7|title=Football}}</ref> Many clubs' early nicknames was derived from an abbreviation or demonym of the club's suburb, but St Kilda is unique among the AFL clubs in now utilising this as its official nickname.

In 1953 the Saints' jumper took on a \"vest\" style of the three stripes; red, white and black on the front with the club crest, and a plain black back with white numbers \u2013 which is used today. The most common variation on that basic design through the years has been the ribbing area around the sleeves and neck having various alternative designs. For a period from 1997 to 2001, a stylised jumper based on the club crest itself was worn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footyjumpers.com |title=www.footyjumpers.com |publisher=www.footyjumpers.com |date= |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Evolution====\nUniforms worn by St Kilda through its history:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.footyjumpers.com/|title=History of VFL/AFL Jumpers|website=FootyJumpers.com}}</ref>\n\n{|\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _red_black_3|pattern_so= _hoops_black|body= ffffff|shorts= 062A56|socks= ff0000|title= 1897\u20131909}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _red_black_3|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1910\u201314}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _red_black_3|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffcc00|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1915\u201318 }}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _stkilda 1919|pattern_so= _redtop|body= 000000|shorts= ffffff|socks= 000000|title= 1919\u201322}}\n|-\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _stkilda 1923|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1923\u201352}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redwhiteblack|pattern_so= _hoops_black_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 1953\u201396}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _stkilda 1997|pattern_so= _redtop|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= 000000|title= 1997\u20132001}}\n|{{Australian rules football kit box\n|pattern_b= _redwhiteblack|pattern_so= _hoops_black_red|body= ffffff|shorts= 000000|socks= ffffff|title= 2002\u2013present}}\n|}\n\nThe St Kilda jumper has three vertical stripes of red, white and black on the front with the club crest a plain black back with white ribbing and numbers.  The current club sponsors are Dare Iced Coffee & Pepper Money whose logos appear alternating on the front and back of the uniform for home and away games. The clash jumper is very distinct from the home jumper, bearing red, white and black vertical stripes with a white back. The club's current apparel partner is [[ISC (sportswear)|International Sports Clothing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.saints.com.au/news/2019-10-21/saints-partner-with-isc|title=Saints partner with ISC|publisher=St Kilda FC|date=21 October 2019|accessdate=21 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Logos===\nThe club has used many logos since it was formed in 1873 for promotional and merchandise purposes. The league did not use official club logos until approximately the 1970s. Prior to the 1970s logos were generally created by clubs and in some cases outside companies for sales of merchandise but were in no way official ( or registered trademarks in some cases ). In the past all the club logos were printed in the same basic design frame ( in the form of a badge or shield shape ) and had each club's individual colours, name and design in them. St Kilda used several different logos, including some featuring the stick figure in the 1980s and 1990s. Shortly after the league officially changed its name to the AFL prior to the start of the 1990 premiership season, the club used a logo with a red white and black vertically striped design with the goal and behind posts on it, with a stick figure attempting a mark on it with a halo above its head, with the league logo and the club crest on top of either behind post.\n\n====Club crest as the official logo====\nA logo change before the start of the 1995 season saw the club make the decision to use the official club crest \u2013 which has been on the club jumper since it was first designed in the 1930s and was already an officially registered trade mark of the club \u2013 as the club's official logo in the league. The crest is an iconic feature of the club's jumper \u2013 a well-known and recognisable symbol of the club. The crest also includes the club's motto, ''Fortius Quo Fidelius'', which is usually translated as \"Strength through loyalty\". As with the nickname \"Saints\" the club crest has no religious associations.\n\n===Club song===\nThe club song is an adaption of \"When The Saints Go Marching In\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footy.com.au/dags/songs/saints.html |title=St Kilda Saints Club Song |publisher=Footy.com.au |date=28 April 1998 |accessdate=10 December 2011}}</ref> The song was recorded in 1972 by the Fable Singers and released as a single.

When the club moved to Moorabbin Oval a popular chant called \"We are the Saints\" was sung by supporters. In the late 1960s \"When The Saints Go Marching In\" eventually became established as the club song. The tune is used by permission under licence.\n\n==Home ground==\n{{See also|Docklands Stadium}}\n\n[[File:Etihad Stadium crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|[[Docklands Stadium]] \u2013 St Kilda's home ground]]\n\n===Current home grounds===\n* [[Docklands Stadium]], [[Melbourne]].\n\n===Former home grounds===\n* [[Junction Oval]], [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]; 1877\u20131964\n* [[Moorabbin Oval]], [[Moorabbin, Victoria|Moorabbin]]; 1965\u20131992\n* [[Waverley Park]], [[Mulgrave, Victoria|Mulgrave]]; 1993\u20131999\n* [[Wellington Regional Stadium]] (Westpac Stadium), [[Wellington]], New Zealand; 2013\u20132015\n* [[York Park]], 2003\u20132006\n\n===Training, administration and entertainment facilities===\n[[File:Training drill in front of stand, St Kilda FC 01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Players training in front of the [[Graham Huggins|G.

The development was a St Kilda Football Club development in conjunction with the Frankston City Council, the Victorian state government and the AFL. The new facility was completed at a cost of approximately 9.5 million dollars and named the Linen House Centre under a naming rights sponsorship deal.\n\nIn 2019 the club relocated back to Moorabin Oval.\n\n===Moorabbin Oval redevelopment===\nMoorabbin Oval has undergone a two-stage redevelopment, costing approximately 30 million dollars, for the St Kilda Football Club.

As part of the development deal the parkland outside the outer side of the oval (behind the old terraces that were on the outer side of the ground) is no longer leased by St Kilda FC and has been released back to the local council. It will serve as the primary home ground for the [[Sandringham Dragons]] and the [[Southern Football League (Victoria)|Southern Football League]] as well as being the administrative centre for football development in the south-east.

From 1919 to 1991 the VFL/AFL operated a [[reserve team|reserves competition]] and, from 1992 to 1999, a ''de facto'' AFL reserves competition was run by the [[Victorian State Football League]]. St Kilda fielded a reserves team in both of these competitions, allowing players who were not selected for the senior team to play for St Kilda in the lower grade. During that time, the St Kilda reserves team won three premierships (1942, 1943 and 1961). Following the demise of the AFL reserves competition, the St Kilda reserves team competed in the new [[Victorian Football League]] in the 2000 season before the team was dissolved at the end of the year.\n\nIn 2001, St Kilda entered a [[Australian Football League reserves affiliations|reserves affiliation]] with existing VFL club [[Springvale Football Club|Springvale]] (which moved to Cranbourne and was renamed [[Casey Scorpions|Casey]] in 2006). Under the affiliation, reserves players for St Kilda played VFL football with Springvale/Casey.

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].

He most likely gained knowledge of the bird from sources in Egypt. The 16th-century French priest and traveller [[Andr\u00e9 Thevet]] also wrote a description of a mysterious bird in 1558 that has been likened by Kinzelbach to this species.<ref name=kinzelbach>{{cite journal |last1=Kinzelbach |first1=Ragnar K. |title=Pre-Linnaean pictures of the secretarybird, ''Sagittarius serpentarius'' (J.

Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method.

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Rodents and grasshoppers likely form the bulk of its diet, though it does kill snakes. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, anecdotal observations and the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation. The species is therefore classed as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]]. The secretarybird appears on the [[Coat of arms|coats of arms]] of [[Emblem of Sudan|Sudan]] and [[Coat of arms of South Africa|South Africa]].\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=Position of the secretarybird in the order [[Accipitriformes]].

Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method.
