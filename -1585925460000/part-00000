It is located approximately 10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) northwest of the capital [[Ashgabat]] (Ashkhabad). The old airport, with its air traffic control tower and a {{convert|12000|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} precision approach runway (12L-30R), opened in 1994 and was named after the country's first president, [[Saparmyrat Niyazov]]. The new airport opened in 2016 after being completely redesigned and rebuilt.\n\n==History==\n=== Soviet time ===\nThe beginning of Turkmen civil aviation can be considered 1927, at that time air communications began to work between [[Chardzhou]] and [[Tashauz]], flying through the settlements of [[Turtkul]] and [[Urgench|Novo-Urgench]] (both [[Uzbek SSR]]). For this flight, aircraft were used for [[Junkers F.13]] passengers for four people who were purchased in [[Germany]], as well as Soviet passenger [[Kalinin K-4]] aircraft. 8 aircraft served this airline. Later, in 1932, Soviet aircraft were purchased for the transport of passengers. [[Kalinin K-5]] aircraft had six seats, as well as [[Tupolev ANT-9]] aircraft, which had twelve seats. With the replenishment of the air fleet of Turkmen SSR, in 1932, an air division was formed at [[Turkmenabat International Airport|Chardzhou Airport]] that directly served the [[Chardzhou]]-[[Tashauz]] route, without transfers to other settlements.\n\n=== Independent Turkmenistan ===\n[[File:Stans08-098 (3134913370).jpg|thumb|Ashgabat Airport building from 1994 to 2013]]\nThe airport building opened in 1994 and the terminal has a capacity of 1,600 passengers per hour. In Soviet times, the airport was used exclusively for domestic flights. Currently, the airport serves a number of foreign airlines, operating for both passengers and cargo.\n\nAs part of [[Saparmurat Niyazov]]'s aspiration to transform Turkmenistan into 'the new [[Kuwait]]', he sought to construct a distinctive airport. This zeal resulted in the control tower being constructed on the wrong side of the runway. The 'gaudy new terminal' now blocked the view of air traffic controllers as they guided pilots. The builders warned him of this, however, he responded that, \"It looks better this way.\"<ref>Ghost Wars, Steve Coll; pg. 303 along with the corresponding footnote on pg. 627.</ref>\n\nThe building was dismantled in 2013.\n\n=== New building (2016) ===\n[[File:Ashgabat Airport (36168828256).jpg|thumb|Interior of the new terminal]]\n[[File:Ashgabat Airport (36075375061).jpg|thumb|Interior of the new terminal]]\nThe Turkmen government opened an international tender in 2012 for the construction of a new international airport in [[Ashgabat]], to be named \"[[Oghuz Khagan|Oguz Han]]\". Polimeks, a Turkish construction company active in [[Turkmenistan]] since the late-1990s, was declared as the winner of the tender. The new airport was opened on 17 September 2016 by the [[President of Turkmenistan]] [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.turkmenistan.gov.tm/_eng/?id=6453 |title=The President of Turkmenistan took part in the opening of new Ashgabat International Airport |publisher=Turkmenistan.

The new airport is able to serve 14 million passengers per year. It has the capacity to handle 1,600 passengers per hour. The airport has a closed-area of 350,000 m<sup>2</sup> and includes a passenger terminal, VIP terminal, cargo terminal with a capacity to handle 200,000 tonnes of freight per year, a new [[air traffic control]] tower (ATCT), a maintenance [[hangar]] for three [[narrow-body aircraft]], new fuelling stations, catering, [[fire brigade]], [[flight simulation]], [[repair and maintenance]] buildings, parking space for 3.000 cars, a civil aviation school as well as a medical center. The airport has also a new 3,800m long runway to serve [[wide-body]], double-deck jet airliners such as the [[Airbus A380]] and [[Boeing 747-8]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/22346975.asp |title=T\u00fcrk firmas\u0131 T\u00fcrkmenistan'da 2.25 milyar dolarl\u0131k ihale kazand\u0131 \u2013 H\u00fcrriyet EKONOM\u0130 |publisher=Hurriyet.com.tr |date= |accessdate=22 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\nThere are two artificial runways, equipped with the second category ILS and platform, enabling them to take aircraft of all types.

codes|ASB|UTAA}}), formerly known as ''Saparmyrat T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy International Airport'', is one of five [[international airport]]s in [[Turkmenistan]].  It is located approximately 10&nbsp;km (6&nbsp;mi) northwest of the capital [[Ashgabat]] (Ashkhabad). The old airport, with its air traffic control tower and a {{convert|12000|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} precision approach runway (12L-30R), opened in 1994 and was named after the country's first president, [[Saparmyrat Niyazov]]. The new airport opened in 2016 after being completely redesigned and rebuilt.\n\n==History==\n=== Soviet time ===\nThe beginning of Turkmen civil aviation can be considered 1927, at that time air communications began to work between [[Chardzhou]] and [[Tashauz]], flying through the settlements of [[Turtkul]] and [[Urgench|Novo-Urgench]] (both [[Uzbek SSR]]). For this flight, aircraft were used for [[Junkers F.13]] passengers for four people who were purchased in [[Germany]], as well as Soviet passenger [[Kalinin K-4]] aircraft. 8 aircraft served this airline. Later, in 1932, Soviet aircraft were purchased for the transport of passengers. [[Kalinin K-5]] aircraft had six seats, as well as [[Tupolev ANT-9]] aircraft, which had twelve seats. With the replenishment of the air fleet of Turkmen SSR, in 1932, an air division was formed at [[Turkmenabat International Airport|Chardzhou Airport]] that directly served the [[Chardzhou]]-[[Tashauz]] route, without transfers to other settlements.\n\n=== Independent Turkmenistan ===\n[[File:Stans08-098 (3134913370).jpg|thumb|Ashgabat Airport bulding from 1994 to 2013]]\nThe airport building opened in 1994 and the terminal has a capacity of 1,600 passengers per hour. In Soviet times, the airport was used exclusively for domestic flights. Currently, the airport serves a number of foreign airlines, operating for both passengers and cargo.\n\nAs part of [[Saparmurat Niyazov]]'s aspiration to transform Turkmenistan into 'the new [[Kuwait]]', he sought to construct a distinctive airport. This zeal resulted in the control tower being constructed on the wrong side of the runway. The 'gaudy new terminal' now blocked the view of air traffic controllers as they guided pilots. The builders warned him of this, however, he responded that, \"It looks better this way.\"<ref>Ghost Wars, Steve Coll; pg. 303 along with the corresponding footnote on pg. 627.</ref>\n\nThe building was dismantled in 2013.\n\n=== New building (2016) ===\n[[File:Ashgabat Airport (36168828256).jpg|thumb|Interior of the new terminal]]\n[[File:Ashgabat Airport (36075375061).jpg|thumb|Interior of the new terminal]]\nThe Turkmen government opened an international tender in 2012 for the construction of a new international airport in [[Ashgabat]], to be named \"[[Oghuz Khagan|Oguz Han]]\". Polimeks, a Turkish construction company active in [[Turkmenistan]] since the late-1990s, was declared as the winner of the tender. The new airport was opened on 17 September 2016 by the [[President of Turkmenistan]] [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow]].<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.turkmenistan.gov.tm/_eng/?id=6453 |title=The President of Turkmenistan took part in the opening of new Ashgabat International Airport |publisher=Turkmenistan.

The new airport is able to serve 14 million passengers per year. It has the capacity to handle 1,600 passengers per hour. The airport has a closed-area of 350,000 m<sup>2</sup> and include a passenger terminal, VIP terminal, cargo terminal with a capacity to handle 200,000 tonnes of freight per year, a new [[air traffic control]] tower (ATCT), a maintenance [[hangar]] for three [[narrow-body aircraft]], new fuelling stations, catering, [[fire brigade]], [[flight simulation]], [[repair and maintenance]] buildings, parking space for 3.000 cars, a civil aviation school as well as a medical center. The airport has also a new 3,800m long runway to serve [[wide-body]], double-deck jet airliners such as the [[Airbus A380]] and [[Boeing 747-8]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/22346975.asp |title=T\u00fcrk firmas\u0131 T\u00fcrkmenistan'da 2.25 milyar dolarl\u0131k ihale kazand\u0131 \u2013 H\u00fcrriyet EKONOM\u0130 |publisher=Hurriyet.com.tr |date= |accessdate=22 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Facilities==\nThere are two artificial runways, equipped with the second category ILS and platform, enabling them to take aircraft of all types.

The plot centers on a [[pandemic]] of a weaponized strain of [[influenza]] that kills almost the entire world population. The few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. In writing the book, King sought to create an epic in the spirit of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that was set in contemporary America. The book was difficult for King to write because of the large number of characters and storylines.\n\nIn 1990, ''The Stand'' was reprinted as a \"Complete and Uncut\" edition. King restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to ten years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. The Complete and Uncut edition of ''The Stand'' is considered to be King's longest stand-alone work. The book has sold 4.5 million copies.\n\n''The Stand'' was highly appreciated by literary critics and is considered one of King's best novels. It received a number of literary award nominations, including the [[Balrog Award]], the [[Locus Award]] and the [[World Fantasy Award]], and was included in lists of the best books of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the [[Modern Library]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and the [[BBC]]. Reviewers praised the believability of the story, the relevance of the issues raised and the liveliness of the characters, but criticized the protractedness of individual episodes, the plot dualism and the deliberate denouement. A [[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|self-titled miniseries]] based on the novel was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1994. From 2008 to 2012, [[Marvel Comics]] published a [[The Stand (comics)|series of comics]] written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and illustrated by [[Mike Perkins]]. A [[The Stand (upcoming miniseries)|miniseries]] to air on [[CBS All Access]] is in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nAn extremely contagious and lethal strain of [[influenza]], resistant to antibodies and vaccines, is developed as a [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]] within a secret [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] laboratory, and is accidentally released. The Complete and Uncut edition includes a prologue detailing the development of the virus and the security breach that causes its release. The laboratory staff die, but security guard Charles Campion manages to escape and takes his family out of state. After a couple of days, his car crashes at a gas station in Arnette, Texas. The gas station employees and ambulance workers are infected when they take the dying Campion out of his car and to a hospital. The gas station owner infects his cousin, a highway patrolman, and the virus rapidly spreads uncontrollably from there. The [[United States Army]] attempts to isolate Arnette, going as far as to execute unarmed civilians, but the efforts are in vain \u2013 the virus, christened by journalists as the \"superflu\" or \"Captain Trips\", spreads across the country and travels beyond its borders, triggering a global [[pandemic]] of apocalyptic proportions. Approximately 99.4% of the world's population is infected and killed within a month. A prism of several personal tragedies describes the collapse of society, explosions of violence, the inability of the government and [[martial law]] to stop the pandemic, and the near-extinction of humanity. Many survivors of the virus also die, unable to accept the loss of their loved ones or survive in a world where they must fend for themselves.\n\nStuart Redman, one of the gas station employees, proves immune to the virus. He is forcibly held in a specialized center in Stovington, Vermont, in the hope that a treatment can be made. Redman escapes after the center's staff dies; he is forced to kill one of the members in self-defense. He meets with sociology professor Glen Bateman, pregnant college student Frannie Goldsmith, and teenage outcast Harold Lauder. Larry Underwood, a disillusioned pop singer, joins the group in the wake of his mother's death. Stuart and Frannie are drawn to each other and become lovers, to Harold's disappointment and resentment. The group share a common dream in which they see a 108-year-old black woman living in [[Hemingford, Nebraska|Hemingford Home, Nebraska]].<ref>King used Hemingford, NE for both novels, ''The Stand'', and ''It'', America's heartland location for Mother Abigail. '''The Denver Post''', ''USA Weekend'', March 19\u201320, 2010, usaweekend.com, page 2.</ref> The woman, Abigail Freemantle \u2013 better known as \"Mother Abigail\" \u2013 becomes the group's spiritual leader. She brings the group to [[Boulder, Colorado]], to which other survivors are attracted by her telepathic appeals. New additions to the group include Nick Andros, a [[deaf-mute]] deputy from Shoyo, Arkansas; Tom Cullen, a kind-hearted, mentally challenged man from May, Oklahoma; Nadine Cross, a teacher from New Hampshire; and Ralph Brentner, a good-natured farmer from Oklahoma. The group attempts to build a new society. They call their land the \"Free Zone\", organize funeral brigades and restore a supply of electricity.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Randall Flagg]], a \"dark man\" possessing supernatural abilities, creates his own society from people called by his visions. The people worship Flagg as a messiah and joyfully submit to his fascist dictatorship, in which drug addicts are crucified. Flagg rescues potentially cannibalistic prisoner Lloyd Henreid and makes him his right-hand man. A [[Pyromania|pyromaniac]] nicknamed \"The Trashcan Man\", after destroying oil tanks in [[Gary, Indiana]] and meeting a madman named \"The Kid\", joins Flagg's group and becomes a weapons specialist. Flagg prepares for war with Boulder. Mother Abigail, feeling that she has become prideful due to her pleasure at being a public figure, disappears into the wilderness on a journey of spiritual reconciliation. During her absence, the Free Zone's leadership committee decides to secretly send three people to Flagg's territory to act as spies. Harold and Nadine, tempted by Flagg through their dreams, stage an attack on the committee with a bomb. The explosion kills several people, but most of the committee members avoid the explosion thanks to Mother Abigail's return. Before dying of exhaustion, Mother Abigail reports God's will \u2013 Stuart, Glen, Larry and Ralph must go to Las Vegas and destroy Flagg.\n\nStuart breaks his leg en route and persuades the others to go on without him, telling them that God will provide for him if that is what is meant to happen. The remaining three are soon taken prisoner by Flagg's army. When Glen refuses to grovel before Flagg, he is killed by Lloyd. Flagg gathers his entire collective to witness the execution of Ralph and Larry. Moments before they are to be killed, the Trashcan Man arrives with a retrieved [[nuclear warhead]]. Flagg conjures a magical ball of energy in an attempt to silence a dissenter, but it is transformed into a giant glowing hand \u2014 \"The Hand of God\" \u2014 which detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and killing all of Flagg's followers, in addition to Larry and Ralph. The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously await the birth of Frannie's baby. They fear that the child may not possess an immunity to the superflu and may die, implying a permanent end to humanity. Soon after she gives birth to her son, Stuart returns to Boulder, having been rescued first by a dog, Kojak, and then by Tom, the only survivor of the three Free Zone spies. The baby, Peter, manages to fight off the superflu. Stuart and Frannie decide to leave Boulder and move to [[Ogunquit]] as society is slowly reestablished. The Complete and Uncut Edition includes an [[epilogue]] in which Flagg, having survived the nuclear explosion, wakes up somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. Regaining his former strength, he begins recruiting adherents among a preliterate, dark-skinned people.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Stand characters}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn [[Danse Macabre (book)|''Danse Macabre'']], King writes about the origins of ''The Stand'' at some length. One source was [[Patty Hearst]]'s case. The original idea was to create a novel about the episode because \"it seemed that only a novel might really succeed in explaining all the contradictions\".\n\nThe author also mentions [[George R. Stewart]]'s novel ''[[Earth Abides]]'', which describes the odyssey of one of the last human survivors after the population is nearly annihilated by a plague, as one of the main inspirations:\n\n<blockquote>\nWith my Patty Hearst book, I never found the right way in... and during that entire six-week period, something else was nagging very quietly at the back of my mind. It was a news story I had read about an accidental CBW spill in Utah. (...) This article called up memories of a novel called ''Earth Abides'', by George R. Stewart.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n(...) and one day while sitting at my typewriter, (...) I wrote\u2014just to write something: The world comes to an end but everybody in the SLA is somehow immune. Snake bit them. I looked at that for a while and then typed: No more gas shortages. That was sort of cheerful, in a horrible sort of way.\n<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | authorlink = Stephen King\n  | title = Stephen King's Danse Macabre\n  | publisher = Berkeley Trade\n  | page = 370\n  | isbn = 0-425-18160-X }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''The Stand'' was also planned by King as an epic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''\u2013type story in a contemporary American setting:\n\n<blockquote>For a long time\u2014ten years, at least\u2014I had wanted to write a fantasy epic like ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', only with an American setting. I just couldn't figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, I saw a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment on CBW (chemical-biological warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that [[Dugway sheep incident|killed a bunch of sheep]] (these were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, 'If the winds had been blowing the other way, there was [[Salt Lake City]].' This incident later served as the basis of a movie called ''[[Rage (1972 film)|Rage]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]], but before it was released, I was deep into ''The Stand'', finally writing my American fantasy epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named [[Randall Flagg]]. The land of [[Mordor]] ('where the shadows lie,' according to [[Tolkien]]) was played by Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | title = ''Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'': The Inspiration\n  | url=http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/stand:_the_complete__uncut_edition_the_inspiration.html\n  | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile writing ''The Stand'', King nearly stopped because of [[writer's block]].<ref>''On Writing'', Stephen King, 2000.</ref> Eventually, he reached the conclusion that the heroes were becoming too complacent, and were beginning to repeat all the same mistakes of their old society. In an attempt to resolve this, he added the part of the storyline where Harold and Nadine construct a bomb, which explodes in a Free Zone committee meeting, killing Nick Andros, Chad Norris, and Susan Stern. Later, Mother Abagail explains on her deathbed that God permitted the bombing because He was dissatisfied with the heroes' focus on petty politics, and not on the ultimate quest of destroying Flagg. When telling this story, King sardonically observed that the bomb saved the book, and that he only had to kill half of the core cast to do this.\n\n== Publication history ==\n\nThe novel was originally published in 1978 in hardcover, with a setting date of 1980, in abridged form. The first paperback release in 1980 changed the setting date to 1985. The novel marks the first appearance of [[Randall Flagg]], King's recurring antagonist, whom King would bring back many times in his later writings.\n\n{{Infobox book|\n| name         = The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition\n| title_orig   =\n| translator   =\n| image        = The Stand Uncut.jpg\n| caption = The Complete and Uncut Edition cover\n| author       = [[Stephen King]]\n| cover_artist = John Cayea\n| country      = US\n| language     = English\n| series       =\n| genre        = [[Postapocalyptic]]\n| publisher    = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n| release_date = May 1990\n| media_type   = Print\n| pages        = 1,152\n| isbn         = 978-0-385-19957-5\n| preceded_by  =\n| followed_by  =\n}}\n\nIn 1990, an unabridged edition of ''The Stand'' was published, billed as \"The Complete and Uncut Edition\". Published in hardcover by Doubleday in May 1990, this became the longest book published by King at 1152 pages. When the novel was originally published in 1978, Doubleday warned King that the book's size would make it too expensive for the market to bear.<ref>{{cite book |last= King |first= Stephen |date= 1990 |title= The Stand: The Complete And Uncut Edition |publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |page= xiii |isbn=978-0-307-74368-8 }}</ref> As a result, he cut about 400 pages (around 150,000 words) from the original manuscript.

During the 1980s, Stephen King had planned a theatrical film, with [[George A. Romero]] directing and himself writing, not trusting anybody else with the project. However, writing a workable screenplay proved difficult, due to the novel's length. King talked about adapting it for television, but was informed that the television networks did not \"want to see the end of the world, particularly in prime time.\" Eventually King allowed screenwriter [[Rospo Pallenberg]], who was a fan of ''The Stand'', to write his own adaptation of the novel. Pallenberg's script would clock the film in at close to three hours, while still staying true to the novel. Everyone liked the script; however, just as it was about to finally come together, [[Warner Bros.]] backed out of the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060708173256/http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2006 |title=THE RISE AND FALL OF \"THE STAND\" |publisher=subcin.com |author=Hixx, Don Alex |accessdate=2013-04-18 |df=mdy-all }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] eventually offered Stephen King the chance to make ''The Stand'' into an eight-hour [[television miniseries|miniseries]].

The plot centers on a [[pandemic]] of a weaponized strain of [[influenza]] that kills almost the entire world population. The few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. In writing the book, King sought to create an epic in the spirit of ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' that was set in contemporary America. The book was difficult for King to write because of the large number of characters and storylines.\n\nIn 1990, ''The Stand'' was reprinted as a \"Complete and Uncut\" edition. King restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to ten years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. The Complete and Uncut edition of ''The Stand'' is considered to be King's longest stand-alone work. The book has sold 4.5 million copies.\n\n''The Stand'' was highly appreciated by literary critics and is considered one of King's best novels. It received a number of literary award nominations, including the [[Balrog Award]], the [[Locus Award]] and the [[World Fantasy Award]], and was included in lists of the best books of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', the [[Modern Library]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and the [[BBC]]. Reviewers praised the believability of the story, the relevance of the issues raised and the liveliness of the characters, but criticized the protractedness of individual episodes, the plot dualism and the deliberate denouement. A [[The Stand (1994 miniseries)|self-titled miniseries]] based on the novel was broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in 1994. From 2008 to 2012, [[Marvel Comics]] published a [[The Stand (comics)|series of comics]] written by [[Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa]] and illustrated by [[Mike Perkins]]. A [[The Stand (upcoming miniseries)|miniseries]] to air on [[CBS All Access]] is in development.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nAn extremely contagious and lethal strain of [[influenza]], resistant to antibodies and vaccines, is developed as a [[Biological warfare|biological weapon]] within a secret [[United States Department of Defense|U.S. Department of Defense]] laboratory, and is accidentally released. The Complete and Uncut edition includes a prologue detailing the development of the virus and the security breach that causes its release. The laboratory staff die, but security guard Charles Campion manages to escape and takes his family out of state. After a couple of days, his car crashes at a gas station in Arnette, Texas. The gas station employees and ambulance workers are infected when they take the dying Campion out of his car and to a hospital. The gas station owner infects his cousin, a highway patrolman, and the virus rapidly spreads uncontrollably from there. The [[United States Army]] attempts to isolate Arnette, going as far as to execute unarmed civilians, but the efforts are in vain \u2013 the virus, christened by journalists as the \"superflu\" or \"Captain Trips\", spreads across the country and travels beyond its borders, triggering a global [[pandemic]] of apocalyptic proportions. Approximately 99.4% of the world's population is infected and killed within a month. A prism of several personal tragedies describes the collapse of society, explosions of violence, the inability of the government and [[martial law]] to stop the pandemic, and the near-extinction of humanity. Many survivors of the virus also die, unable to accept the loss of their loved ones or survive in a world where they must fend for themselves.\n\nStuart Redman, one of the gas station employees, proves immune to the virus. He is forcibly held in a specialized center in Stovington, Vermont, in the hope that a treatment can be made. Redman escapes after the center's staff dies; he is forced to kill one of the members in self-defense. He meets with sociology professor Glen Bateman, pregnant college student Frannie Goldsmith, and teenage outcast Harold Lauder. Larry Underwood, a disillusioned pop singer, joins the group in the wake of his mother's death. Stuart and Frannie are drawn to each other and become lovers, to Harold's disappointment and resentment. The group share a common dream in which they see a 108-year-old black woman living in [[Hemingford, Nebraska|Hemingford Home, Nebraska]].<ref>King used Hemingford, NE for both novels, ''The Stand'', and ''It'', America's heartland location for Mother Abigail. '''The Denver Post''', ''USA Weekend'', March 19\u201320, 2010, usaweekend.com, page 2.</ref> The woman, Abigail Freemantle \u2013 better known as \"Mother Abigail\" \u2013 becomes the group's spiritual leader. She brings the group to [[Boulder, Colorado]], to which other survivors are attracted by her telepathic appeals. New additions to the group include Nick Andros, a [[deaf-mute]] deputy from Shoyo, Arkansas; Tom Cullen, a kind-hearted, mentally challenged man from May, Oklahoma; Nadine Cross, a teacher from New Hampshire; and Ralph Brentner, a good-natured farmer from Oklahoma. The group attempts to build a new society. They call their land the \"Free Zone\", organize funeral brigades and restore a supply of electricity.\n\nMeanwhile, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Randall Flagg]], a \"dark man\" possessing supernatural abilities, creates his own society from people called by his visions. The people worship Flagg as a messiah and joyfully submit to his fascist dictatorship, in which drug addicts are crucified. Flagg rescues potentially cannibalistic prisoner Lloyd Henreid and makes him his right-hand man. A [[Pyromania|pyromaniac]] nicknamed \"The Trashcan Man\", after destroying oil tanks in [[Gary, Indiana]] and meeting a madman named \"The Kid\", joins Flagg's group and becomes a weapons specialist. Flagg prepares for war with Boulder. Mother Abigail, feeling that she has become prideful due to her pleasure at being a public figure, disappears into the wilderness on a journey of spiritual reconciliation. During her absence, the Free Zone's leadership committee decides to secretly send three people to Flagg's territory to act as spies. Harold and Nadine, tempted by Flagg through their dreams, stage an attack on the committee with a bomb. The explosion kills several people, but most of the committee members avoid the explosion thanks to Mother Abigail's return. Before dying of exhaustion, Mother Abigail reports God's will \u2013 Stuart, Glen, Larry and Ralph must go to Las Vegas and destroy Flagg.\n\nStuart breaks his leg en route and persuades the others to go on without him, telling them that God will provide for him if that is what is meant to happen. The remaining three are soon taken prisoner by Flagg's army. When Glen refuses to grovel before Flagg, he is killed by Lloyd. Flagg gathers his entire collective to witness the execution of Ralph and Larry. Moments before they are to be killed, the Trashcan Man arrives with a retrieved [[nuclear warhead]]. Flagg conjures a magical ball of energy in an attempt to silence a dissenter, but it is transformed into a giant glowing hand \u2014 \"The Hand of God\" \u2014 which detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas and killing all of Flagg's followers, in addition to Larry and Ralph. The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously await the birth of Frannie's baby. They fear that the child may not possess an immunity to the superflu and may die, implying a permanent end to humanity. Soon after she gives birth to her son, Stuart returns to Boulder, having been rescued first by a dog, Kojak, and then by Tom, the only survivor of the three Free Zone spies. The baby, Peter, manages to fight off the superflu. Stuart and Frannie decide to leave Boulder and move to [[Ogunquit]] as society is slowly reestablished. The Complete and Uncut Edition includes an [[epilogue]] in which Flagg, having survived the nuclear explosion, wakes up somewhere in the Southern Hemisphere. Regaining his former strength, he begins recruiting adherents among a preliterate, dark-skinned people.\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of The Stand characters}}\n\n== Background ==\nIn [[Danse Macabre (book)|''Danse Macabre'']], King writes about the origins of ''The Stand'' at some length.

The original idea was to create a novel about the episode because \"it seemed that only a novel might really succeed in explaining all the contradictions\".\n\nThe author also mentions [[George R. Stewart]]'s novel ''[[Earth Abides]]'', which describes the odyssey of one of the last human survivors after the population is nearly annihilated by a plague, as one of the main inspirations:\n\n<blockquote>\nWith my Patty Hearst book, I never found the right way in... and during that entire six-week period, something else was nagging very quietly at the back of my mind. It was a news story I had read about an accidental CBW spill in Utah. (...) This article called up memories of a novel called ''Earth Abides'', by George R. Stewart.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n(...) and one day while sitting at my typewriter, (...) I wrote\u2014just to write something: The world comes to an end but everybody in the SLA is somehow immune. Snake bit them. I looked at that for a while and then typed: No more gas shortages. That was sort of cheerful, in a horrible sort of way.\n<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | authorlink = Stephen King\n  | title = Stephen King's Danse Macabre\n  | publisher = Berkeley Trade\n  | page = 370\n  | isbn = 0-425-18160-X }}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n''The Stand'' was also planned by King as an epic ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''\u2013type story in a contemporary American setting:\n\n<blockquote>For a long time\u2014ten years, at least\u2014I had wanted to write a fantasy epic like ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', only with an American setting. I just couldn't figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to Boulder, Colorado, I saw a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' segment on CBW (chemical-biological warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that [[Dugway sheep incident|killed a bunch of sheep]] (these were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, 'If the winds had been blowing the other way, there was [[Salt Lake City]].' This incident later served as the basis of a movie called ''[[Rage (1972 film)|Rage]]'', starring [[George C. Scott]], but before it was released, I was deep into ''The Stand'', finally writing my American fantasy epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named [[Randall Flagg]]. The land of [[Mordor]] ('where the shadows lie,' according to [[Tolkien]]) was played by Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web\n  | last = King\n  | first = Stephen\n  | title = ''Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition'': The Inspiration\n  | url=http://www.stephenking.com/library/novel/stand:_the_complete__uncut_edition_the_inspiration.html\n  | accessdate = 2008-08-24 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile writing ''The Stand'', King nearly stopped because of [[writer's block]].<ref>''On Writing'', Stephen King, 2000.</ref> Eventually, he reached the conclusion that the heroes were becoming too complacent, and were beginning to repeat all the same mistakes of their old society. In an attempt to resolve this, he added the part of the storyline where Harold and Nadine construct a bomb, which explodes in a Free Zone committee meeting, killing Nick Andros, Chad Norris, and Susan Stern. Later, Mother Abagail explains on her deathbed that God permitted the bombing because He was dissatisfied with the heroes' focus on petty politics, and not on the ultimate quest of destroying Flagg. When telling this story, King sardonically observed that the bomb saved the book, and that he only had to kill half of the core cast to do this.\n\n== Publication history ==\n\nThe novel was originally published in 1978 in hardcover, with a setting date of 1980, in abridged form. The first paperback release in 1980 changed the setting date to 1985. The novel marks the first appearance of [[Randall Flagg]], King's recurring antagonist, whom King would bring back many times in his later writings.\n\n{{Infobox book|\n| name         = The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition\n| title_orig   =\n| translator   =\n| image        = The Stand Uncut.jpg\n| caption = The Complete and Uncut Edition cover\n| author       = [[Stephen King]]\n| cover_artist = John Cayea\n| country      = US\n| language     = English\n| series       =\n| genre        = [[Postapocalyptic]]\n| publisher    = [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]\n| release_date = May 1990\n| media_type   = Print\n| pages        = 1,152\n| isbn         = 978-0-385-19957-5\n| preceded_by  =\n| followed_by  =\n}}\n\nIn 1990, an unabridged edition of ''The Stand'' was published, billed as \"The Complete and Uncut Edition\". Published in hardcover by Doubleday in May 1990, this became the longest book published by King at 1152 pages. When the novel was originally published in 1978, Doubleday warned King that the book's size would make it too expensive for the market to bear.<ref>{{cite book |last= King |first= Stephen |date= 1990 |title= The Stand: The Complete And Uncut Edition |publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] |page= xiii |isbn=978-0-307-74368-8 }}</ref> As a result, he cut about 400 pages (around 150,000 words) from the original manuscript. This edition reinstates most of the deleted pages (as selected by King), as well as updates the setting from the 1980s to the 1990s. This new edition features a new preface by King, and illustrations by [[Bernie Wrightson]]. Additionally, Doubleday published a deluxe edition of ''The Stand: The Complete & Uncut Edition'', limited to 1,250 numbered copies and 52 lettered copies.

During the 1980s, Stephen King had planned a theatrical film, with [[George A. Romero]] directing and himself writing, not trusting anybody else with the project. However, writing a workable screenplay proved difficult, due to the novel's length. King talked about adapting it for television, but was informed that the television networks did not \"want to see the end of the world, particularly in prime time.\" Eventually King allowed screenwriter [[Rospo Pallenberg]], who was a fan of ''The Stand'', to write his own adaptation of the novel. Pallenberg's script would clock the film in at close to three hours, while still staying true to the novel. Everyone liked the script; however, just as it was about to finally come together, [[Warner Bros.]] backed out of the project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20060708173256/http://www.subcin.com/risefallstand.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 8, 2006 |title=THE RISE AND FALL OF \"THE STAND\" |publisher=subcin.com |author=Hixx, Don Alex |accessdate=2013-04-18 |df=mdy-all }}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] eventually offered Stephen King the chance to make ''The Stand'' into an eight-hour [[television miniseries|miniseries]].

Fults, after leaving the service of the [[United States]] during the [[War of 1812]] in 1817, settled on Moredock Lake. He then moved to the Renault precinct, first up Braun's Hollow, then in 1829 to the settlement known at the time as Braunsberg, which would eventually take his name, until his death in 1841.\n\nA site on the [[cliffs|bluffs]] just north of Fults, overlooking the Bottoms is known as Saltpetre Cave and took its name from the quantities of [[bat guano]] mined there for [[potassium nitrate]] which was used in the local manufacture of black powder by the French at [[Fort de Chartres]] and later inhabitants. This cave, cut into the side of the bluffs, and an excellent defensive position, was one of the last refuges for Native Americans in the region.<ref>Combined History of Randolph, Monroe and Perry Counties, Illinois, J.
