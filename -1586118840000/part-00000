It was the serious paper of record.\n\nFounded in 1861 by [[Edmund Chojecki]] (writing under the [[pen name]] \"Charles Edmond\") and [[Auguste Nefftzer]], ''Le Temps'' was under Nefftzer's direction for ten years, when [[Adrien H\u00e9brard]] took his place, and for nearly 45 years directed the newspaper with an iron hand until his death in 1914. He was succeeded by his sons \u00c9mile (1914), and Adrien Jr. (1925) and by Louis Mills (1929). Soon after Mills' death in 1931, ''Le Temps'' became a public limited company. Adrien H\u00e9brard and his successors left substantial freedom to the editorial room and the newspaper had the reputation of keeping its journalists for a long time. ''Le Temps'' always remained moderate politically. The early issues of the newspaper reflected Nefftzer's liberal philosophy had considerable trouble achieving readership. He had to frequently turn to friends in [[Alsace]] who were able to help support ''Le Temps'' financially. However, circulation continued to grow, from scarcely 3,000 in 1861, to 11,000 in 1869, 22,000 in 1880, 30,000 in 1884, 35,000 in 1904. During the interwar period it varied between 50,000 and 80,000. Despite this comparatively modest circulation, ''Le Temps'' soon became the most important newspaper of the [[Third French Republic|French Republic]] particularly among the French political and economic elite.
