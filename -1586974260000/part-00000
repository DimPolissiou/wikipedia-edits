His true parentage is debated; most ancient historians and the modern academic consensus maintain he was a pretender who claimed to be a Seleucid, either a son of [[Alexander Balas|Alexander I]] or an adopted son of [[Antiochus VII Sidetes|Antiochus VII]]. His surname \"Zabinas\" is a Semitic name that is usually translated as \"the bought one\". It is possible, however, that Alexander II was a natural son of Alexander I, as the surname can also mean \"bought from the god\". The iconography of Alexander II's coinage indicates he based his claims to the throne on his descent from [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]], the father of Alexander I.\n\nAlexander II's rise is connected to the dynastic feuds of the Seleucid Empire. Both King Seleucus IV (d. 175 BC) and his brother Antiochus IV (d. 164 BC) had descendants contending for the throne, leading the country to experience many civil wars. The situation was complicated by [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egyptian]] interference, which was facilitated by the dynastic marriages between the two royal houses. In 128 BC, King [[Demetrius II Nicator|Demetrius II]] of Syria, the representative of Seleucus IV's line, invaded Egypt to help his mother-in-law [[Cleopatra II of Egypt|Cleopatra II]] who was engaged in a civil war against her brother and husband King [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy VIII]]. Angered by the Syrian invasion, the Egyptian king instigated revolts in the cities of Syria against Demetrius II and chose Alexander II, a supposed representative of Antiochus IV's line, as an [[anti-king]]. With Egyptian troops, Alexander II captured the Syrian capital [[Antioch]] in 128 BC and warred against Demetrius II, defeating him decisively in 125 BC. The beaten king escaped to his wife [[Cleopatra Thea]] in the city of [[Ptolemais in Phoenicia|Ptolemais]], but she expelled him. He was killed while trying to find refuge in the city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].\n\nWith the death of Demetrius II, Alexander II became the master of the kingdom, controlling the realm except for a small pocket around Ptolemais where Cleopatra Thea ruled. Alexander II was a beloved king, known for his kindness and forgiving nature. He maintained friendly relations with [[John Hyrcanus|John I Hyrcanus]] of Judea, who acknowledged the Syrian king as his [[Suzerainty|suzerain]]. Alexander II's successes were not welcomed by Egypt's Ptolemy VIII, who did not want a strong king on the Syrian throne. Thus, in 124 BC an alliance was established between Egypt and Cleopatra Thea, now ruling jointly with [[Antiochus VIII Grypus|Antiochus VIII]], her son by Demetrius II. Alexander II was defeated, and he escaped to Antioch, where he pillaged the temple of [[Zeus]] to pay his soldiers; the population turned against him, and he fled and was eventually captured. Alexander II was probably executed by Antiochus VIII in 123 BC, ending the line of Antiochus IV.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Antiochus IV Epiphanes.jpg|thumb|alt=Coin with Antiochus IV likeness on the obverse and the statue of a seated deity on the reverse|Tetrachalkon of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]], possible grandfather of Alexander II]]\n[[File:Coin of Antiochus VII Euergetes.jpg|thumb|alt=Coin with Antiochus VII likeness on the obverse and the statue of a standing deity on the reverse|[[Tetradrachm]] of [[Antiochus VII Sidetes|Antiochus VII]], Alexander II's alleged adoptive father]]\n[[File:Coin of Demetrius II Nicator, Ptolemais in Phoenicia mint.jpg|thumb|alt=Coin with Demetrius II likeness on the obverse and the statue of a seated deity on the reverse|Tetradrachm of [[Demetrius II Nicator|Demetrius II]], Alexander II's opponent]]\n[[File:Ptolemy VIII radiate.jpg|thumb|alt=Coin with Ptolemy VIII likeness on the obverse and the statue of an eagle on the reverse|Tetradrachm of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy VIII]], Alexander II's patron]]\nThe death of the Seleucid king [[Seleucus IV Philopator|Seleucus IV]] in 175 BC created a dynastic crisis because of the illegal succession of his brother [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]].

Likewise, it is possible Alexander II was indeed a son of Alexander I adopted by Antiochus VII. The second century historian [[Arrian]] spoke of an Alexander, the son of Alexander I, who was elevated to kingship by Tryphon in 145 BC; this passage is puzzling as it is numismatically proven that it was Antiochus VI whom Tryphon raised to the throne.

An Egyptian army was sent to support the faction of Antiochus VIII against Alexander{{nbsp}}II.{{#tag:ref|The treaty between Cleopatra Thea and Ptolemy VIII is not mentioned in ancient sources, but several historians, such as [[Alfred Bellinger]] and John Whitehorne, consider its existence likely.{{sfn|Bellinger|1949|p=64}}{{sfn|Whitehorne|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0-IAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA161 161]}} The installation of Antiochus VIII on his throne might also have been part of the deal; given the fact that Cleopatra Thea killed her eldest son to remain a sole monarch, her acceptance of sharing her power with Antiochus VIII can be understood if it was part of a deal she struck under the pressure of Alexander II's victories.{{sfn|Bellinger|1949|p=65}}<br />According to Bouch\u00e9-Leclercq, it was Cleopatra II who probably pushed for Egypt's abandonment of Alexander II, and the establishment of the alliance between Ptolemy VIII and Antiochus VIII, which included the dynastic marriage of the Syrian king and Tryphaena.{{sfn|Bouch\u00e9-Leclercq|1913|p=398}}|group=note}}{{sfn|Justin|1742|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=3xlXAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA279 279]}} The return of Cleopatra II and the marriage of Antiochus VIII both took place in 124 BC.{{sfn|Otto|Bengtson|1938|pp= 103, 104}}\n\n===War with Antiochus VIII, defeat and death===\n[[File:Syria in 124 BC.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Syria in early 124 BC; Alexander II was in control of the country with the exception of the city of Ptolemais]]\nSupported by the Egyptian troops, Antiochus VIII waged war against Alexander II, who lost most of his lands.{{sfn|Ehling|1998|p=149}} He lost Ashkelon in 189 SE (124/123 BC).{{sfn|Spaer|1984|p=230}} The final battle took place at an unknown location in the first half of 123 BC, ending with Alexander II's defeat.{{sfn|Ehling|1998|p=149}}{{sfn|Bellinger|1949|p=64}} Different ancient historians presented varying accounts of Alexander II's end.

Instead of fighting, Alexander II decided to take the royal treasuries, steal the valuables of the temples, and sail to Greece at night. While pillaging the temple of Zeus with some of his foreign subordinates, he was discovered by the populace and barely escaped with his life. Accompanied by a few men he went to Seleucia Pieria, but the news of his sacrilege arrived before him. The city closed its gates, forcing him to seek shelter in [[Ras al-Bassit|Posidium]]. Two days after pillaging the temple, Alexander II was caught and brought in chains to Antiochus VIII in his camp, suffering the insults and humiliation at the hands of his enemies. People who witnessed the indignation of Alexander II were shocked at the scene they thought could never happen. After accepting what had occurred in front of them was reality, they looked away with astonishment.{{sfn|Stronk|2016|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sC1WDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA522 522]}}\n*In the account of Justin, Alexander II fled to Antioch following his defeat at the hands of Antiochus VIII. Lacking the resources to pay his troops, the king ordered the removal of a golden Nike from the temple of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] (Zeus), joking that \"victory was lent to him by Jupiter\". A few days later, Alexander II himself ordered the golden statue of Jupiter to be taken out under the cover of night. The city's populace revolted against the king, and he was forced to flee. He was later deserted by his men and caught by bandits; they delivered him to Antiochus VIII, who ordered him executed.{{sfn|Justin|1742|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3xlXAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA279 279]}}\n[[File:Alex zabina.png|thumb|alt=Coin of Alexander II. The obverse depicts a bust of the king. The reverse depicts a seated Zeus|The golden stater probably minted using the spoils from [[Zeus]]' temple]]\nAlexander II issued two series of gold staters. One bears his epithets and dates to 125 BC according to many numismatists, such as Oliver Hoover and Arthur Houghton, and another bearing only the title of king (''[[basileus]]''). Earlier numismatists, such as [[Edward Theodore Newell]] and [[Ernest Babelon]], who only knew about the 125 BC stater, suggested that it was minted with the gold pillaged from the temple. However, the iconography of that stater does not match that used for Alexander II's late coinage, as the diadem ties fall in a straight fashion on the neck. On the other hand, the arrangement of the diadem ties on the stater that lacks the royal epithets is more consistent with Alexander II's late tetradrachm, making it more reasonable to associate that stater with the Nike theft.{{#tag:ref|The association of the gold stater with the sacrilege act can be accepted only if the account of Justin is preferred to that of Diodorus Siculus, as he stated that Alexander II was caught only two days after pillaging the temple, giving the king no time to mint currency.{{sfn|Houghton|Lorber|Hoover|2008|p=449}}|group=note}}{{sfn|Houghton|Lorber|Hoover|2008|p=449}}\n\nThough his last coins were issued in 190 SE (123/122 BC), ancient historians do not provide the explicit date of Alexander II's death.{{sfn|Sch\u00fcrer|1973|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oG5jAgAAQBAJ&pg=132 132]}} He probably died by October 123 BC since the first Antiochene coins of Antiochus VIII were issued in 190 SE (123/122 BC).{{sfn|Ehling|1998|p=150}}{{sfn|Bellinger|1949|p=65}} Damascus kept striking coinage in the name of Alexander II until 191 SE (122/121 BC), when the forces of Antiochus VIII took it.{{sfn|Bellinger|1949|p=65}} According to Diodorus Siculus, many who witnessed the king's end \"remarked in various ways on the fickleness of fate, the reversals in human fortunes, the sudden turns of tide, and how changeable life could be, far beyond what anyone would expect\".{{sfn|Stronk|2016|p=523}} No wife or children of Alexander II, if he had any, are known;{{sfn|Ogden|1999|p= 152}} with his death, the line of Antiochus IV became extinct.{{sfn|Wright|2008|p=538}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Asia}}\n* [[List of Syrian monarchs]]\n* [[Timeline of Syrian history]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|colwidth=40em}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Joel|year= 2019|title=The Roman Republic in the Hellenistic Mediterranean: From Alexander to Caesar|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|isbn=978-1-118-95933-6|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Anson|first=Edward M.|year= 2015|title=Eumenes of Cardia: A Greek among Macedonians|edition=second|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]|series=Mnemosyne, Supplements, History and Archaeology of Classical Antiquity|volume=383|issn=2352-8656|isbn=978-9-004-29717-3|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Israel_Numismatic_Journal.html?id=t1RmAAAAMAAJ|last1=Barag|first1=Dan|last2=Qedar|first2=Shraga|year= 1980|title=The Beginning of Hasmonean Coinage|journal=Israel Numismatic Journal|publisher=Israel Numismatic Society|volume=4|issn=0021-2288|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Bellinger|first=Alfred R.|year= 1949|title=The End of the Seleucids|journal=Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences|publisher=[[Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences]]|volume=38|oclc=4520682|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.181878/page/n275|last1=Bevan|first1=Edwyn Robert|year= 1902|title=The House of Seleucus|volume=II|publisher=[[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Edward Arnold]]|oclc=499314408|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|series=Approaching the Ancient World|volume=2|last=Biers|first=William R.|year=1992|title=Art, Artefacts and Chronology in Classical Archaeology|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0-415-06319-7|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/histoiredessle01bouc#page/392/mode/2up|title=Histoire des S\u00e9leucides (323-64 avant J.-C.)|language=fr|first=Auguste|last=Bouch\u00e9-Leclercq|publisher= Ernest Leroux|year= 1913|oclc=558064110|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|url=http://essays.wls.wels.net/handle/123456789/782?show=full|last=Brug|first=John F.|year= 1981|title=An Interdisciplinary Study of the \"A\" Coins of Yehochanan|journal=The Augur: Journal of the Biblical Numismatic Society|publisher= Biblical Numismatic Society|volume=31/32|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=Kings and Usurpers in the Seleukid Empire: The Men who Would be King|first=Boris|last=Chrubasik|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|series=Oxford Classical Monographs|year= 2016|isbn=978-0-198-78692-4|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=The Hellenistic Settlements in Syria, the Red Sea Basin, and North Africa|first=Getzel M.|last=Cohen|year= 2006|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|series=Hellenistic Culture and Society|volume=46|isbn=978-0-520-93102-2|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/classical-review/article/fischer-thomas-untersuchungen-zum-partherkrieg-antiochos-vii-im-rahmen-der-seleukidengeschichte-munchen-diss-pp-ix-125-1-map-tubingen-privately-printed-1970-obtainable-from-the-author-heinleinstrasse-28-74-tubingenderendingen-paper-dm12/5697C9463EAF8E816455646D85B7D041|last=Colledge|first=Malcolm A.

His true parentage is debated; most ancient historians and the modern academic consensus maintain he was a pretender who claimed to be a Seleucid, either a son of [[Alexander Balas|Alexander I]] or an adopted son of [[Antiochus VII Sidetes|Antiochus VII]]. His surname \"Zabinas\" is a Semitic name that is usually translated as \"the bought one\". It is possible, however, that Alexander II was a natural son of Alexander I, as the surname can also mean \"bought from the god\". The iconography of Alexander II's coinage indicates he based his claims to the throne on his descent from [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]], the father of Alexander I.\n\nAlexander II's rise is connected to the dynastic feuds of the Seleucid Empire. Both King Seleucus IV (d. 175 BC) and his brother Antiochus IV (d. 164 BC) had descendants contending for the throne, leading the country to experience many civil wars. The situation was complicated by [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemaic]] [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Egyptian]] interference, which was facilitated by the dynastic marriages between the two royal houses. In 128 BC, King [[Demetrius II Nicator|Demetrius II]] of Syria, the representative of Seleucus IV's line, invaded Egypt to help his mother-in-law [[Cleopatra II of Egypt|Cleopatra II]] who was engaged in a civil war against her brother and husband King [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy VIII]]. Angered by the Syrian invasion, the Egyptian king instigated revolts in the cities of Syria against Demetrius II and chose Alexander II, a supposed representative of Antiochus IV's line, as an [[anti-king]]. With Egyptian troops, Alexander II captured the Syrian capital [[Antioch]] in 128 BC and warred against Demetrius II, defeating him decisively in 125 BC. The beaten king escaped to his wife [[Cleopatra Thea]] in the city of [[Ptolemais in Phoenicia|Ptolemais]], but she expelled him. He was killed while trying to find refuge in the city of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].\n\nWith the death of Demetrius II, Alexander II became the master of the kingdom, controlling the realm except for a small pocket around Ptolemais where Cleopatra Thea ruled. Alexander II was a beloved king, known for his kindness and forgiving nature. He maintained friendly relations with [[John Hyrcanus|John I Hyrcanus]] of Judea, who acknowledged the Syrian king as his [[Suzerainty|suzerain]]. Alexander II's successes were not welcomed by Egypt's Ptolemy VIII, who did not want a strong king on the Syrian throne. Thus, in 124 BC an alliance was established between Egypt and Cleopatra Thea, now ruling jointly with [[Antiochus VIII Grypus|Antiochus VIII]], her son by Demetrius II. Alexander II was defeated, and he escaped to Antioch, where he pillaged the temple of [[Zeus]] to pay his soldiers; the population turned against him, and he fled and was eventually captured. Alexander II was probably executed by Antiochus VIII in 123 BC, ending the line of Antiochus IV.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Antiochus IV Epiphanes.jpg|thumb|alt=Coin with Antiochus IV likeness on the obverse and the statue of a seated deity on the reverse|Tetrachalkon of [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]], possible grandfather of Alexander II]]\n[[File:Coin of Antiochus VII Euergetes.jpg|thumb|alt=Coin with Antiochus VII likeness on the obverse and the statue of a standing deity on the reverse|[[Tetradrachm]] of [[Antiochus VII Sidetes|Antiochus VII]], Alexander II's alleged adoptive father]]\n[[File:Coin of Demetrius II Nicator, Ptolemais in Phoenicia mint.jpg|thumb|alt=Coin with Demetrius II likeness on the obverse and the statue of a seated deity on the reverse|Tetradrachm of [[Demetrius II Nicator|Demetrius II]], Alexander II's opponent]]\n[[File:Ptolemy VIII radiate.jpg|thumb|alt=Coin with Ptolemy VIII likeness on the obverse and the statue of an eagle on the reverse|Tetradrachm of [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy VIII]], Alexander II's patron]]\nThe death of the Seleucid king [[Seleucus IV Philopator|Seleucus IV]] in 175 BC created a dynastic crisis because of the illegal succession of his brother [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV]].

Likewise, it is possible Alexander II was indeed a son of Alexander I adopted by Antiochus VII. The second century historian [[Arrian]] spoke of an Alexander, the son of Alexander I, who was elevated to kingship by Tryphon in 145 BC; this passage is puzzling as it is numismatically proven that it was Antiochus VI whom Tryphon raised to the throne. According to Wright, the language of Arrian indicates he probably had access to sources mentioning Alexander II as a son of Alexander I.{{sfn|Wright|2008|p= 537}}\n*Justin's account regarding Protarchos, the alleged Egyptian father of Alexander II, is illogical.{{sfn|Wright|2011|p= 45}} Wright suggested Alexander II was an illegitimate son of Alexander I;{{sfn|Wright|2012|p= 10}} it is probable Alexander II might have been a younger son of Alexander I destined to become a priest, hence he was called Zabinas\u2014purchased from the god.{{sfn|Wright|2011|p= 45}} It is dubious Alexander II was a low-born Egyptian man, whose claims to the throne were based on publicly known falsifications, yet he was accepted by the Syrians as their king.{{sfn|Wright|2008|p= 538}} The story about Alexander II's Egyptian origin was probably invented by the court of Demetrius II, maintained by the court of his son Antiochus VIII, and kept alive by ancient historians due to its scandalous nature.{{sfn|Wright|2011|p= 45}}\n\n==King of Syria==\n===Ascending the throne===\nThe young Antiochus Epiphanes probably died of an illness.{{sfn|Houghton|Lorber|Hoover|2008|p=436}} Alexander II, whose earliest coins from the capital are dated to 184 SE (129/128 BC), probably landed in northern Syria with Ptolemaic support and declared himself king, taking Antioch in the process;{{sfn|Chrubasik|2016|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=Xxg1DQAAQBAJ&pg=PA143 143]}} the fall of the capital probably took place in spring 128 BC.{{sfn|Ehling|1998|p= 145}} According to Justin's epitome, the Syrians were ready to accept any king other than Demetrius II.{{sfn|Shayegan|2003|p= 96}} Probably soon after capturing Antioch, Alexander II incorporated [[Laodicea in Syria|Laodicea ad mare]] and [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] into his domains.{{#tag:ref|Ehling suggested that Tarsus came under Alexander II's rule early in his reign.{{sfn|Ehling|1998|p=145}} Others, such as the numismatists Arthur Houghton and Oliver Hoover, maintained that the city produced enough coins in the name of Demetrius II to make it plausible that he retained it throughout his reign which ended in 125 BC.{{sfn|Houghton|Lorber|Hoover|2008|p=447}}|group=note}} Other cities, such as [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]], had already freed themselves from Demetrius II during his Egyptian campaign and did not come immediately under Alexander II's authority.{{sfn|Ehling|1998|p=145}}\n\n===Epithets and Royal image===\n[[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] kings did not use [[regnal number]]s, which is a modern practise; instead, they used epithets to distinguish themselves from similarly named monarchs.{{sfn|McGing|2010|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=D8kjH-4ehf4C&pg=247 247]}}{{sfn|Hallo|1996|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=SbsEtMon-dEC&pg=PA142 142]}} The majority of Alexander II's coins did not feature an epithet,{{sfn|Fleischer|1991|p=75}} but the 125 BC series of gold staters bore the epithets ''Theos'' ''Epiphanes'' (god manifest) and ''Nikephoros'' (bearer of victory). Three bronze issues, one of them minted in [[Seleucia Pieria]], are missing the epithet ''Theos'' but retain ''Epiphanes'' and ''Nikephoros''.{{sfn|Houghton|Lorber|Hoover|2008|p=449}} Those epithets, an echo of those of Antiochus IV's, served to emphasise the legitimacy of Alexander II as a Seleucid king.{{sfn|Houghton|Lorber|Hoover|2008|p=444}}\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] (d. 323 BC), founder of the [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)#Empire|Macedonian Empire]], was an important figure in the Hellenistic world; his successors used his legacy to establish their legitimacy.

The \"Alexander portrait type\" is characterised by the upward gaze of the king, and an anastolic hair (a cut where the hair arises off-centre from the forehead, allowing it to fall over it, forming a fringe, and the remaining hair falling on the shoulders, forming a mane or crown).{{sfn|Plantzos|1999|p=54}}{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=196}}|group=note}}{{sfn|Hoover|2002|p=54}}{{sfn|Dahmen|2007|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=BcZ9AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA15 15]}} However, Alexander I and Alexander II, both having Egyptian support, were the only Seleucid kings who paid particular attention to Alexander the Great by depicting themselves wearing the lion scalp, a motif closely connected to the Macedonian king.{{sfn|Hoover|2002|pp=54, 56}} By associating himself with Alexander the Great, Alexander II was continuing the practice of Alexander I, who used the theme of Alexander the Great to strengthen his legitimacy.{{#tag:ref|Alexander I, in contrast to all previous kings, was probably born out of wedlock to Antiochus IV and a concubine, and he was called a bastard by the second century historian, [[Appian]].{{sfn|Wright|2011|p= 43}} Since Antiochus IV was a deified king, Alexander I used the epithet ''theopator'' (son of the god), which emphasised his divine descent and paid no attention to his mother whose status was insignificant for a god's son. By using the iconography of Alexander the Great, Alexander I was alluding to the fact that a son of a deity does not need conventional legitimacy, since Alexander the Great was said to be the son of [[Amun#Greece|Zeus-Amon]] instead of his actual father, [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]].{{sfn|Wright|2011|p= 44}}|group=note}}{{sfn|Wright|2011|pp= 44{{ndash}}45}} \n[[File:Alexander II dyonisus.jpg|thumb|alt= Coin of Alexander II.

Instead of fighting, Alexander II decided to take the royal treasuries, steal the valuables of the temples, and sail to Greece at night. While pillaging the temple of Zeus with some of his foreign subordinates, he was discovered by the populace and barely escaped with his life. Accompanied by a few men he went to Seleucia Pieria, but the news of his sacrilege arrived before him. The city closed its gates, forcing him to seek shelter in [[Ras al-Bassit|Posidium]]. Two days after pillaging the temple, Alexander II was caught and brought in chains to Antiochus VIII in his camp, suffering the insults and humiliation at the hands of his enemies.

A few days later, Alexander II himself ordered the golden statue of Jupiter to be taken out under the cover of night. The city's populace revolted against the king, and he was forced to flee.

However, the iconography of that stater does not match that used for Alexander II's late coinage, as the diadem ties fall in a straight fashion on the neck. On the other hand, the arrangement of the diadem ties on the stater that lacks the royal epithets is more consistent with Alexander II's late tetradrachm, making it more reasonable to associate that stater with the Nike theft.{{#tag:ref|The association of the gold stater with the sacrilege act can be accepted only if the account of Justin is preferred to that of Diodorus Siculus, as he stated that Alexander II was caught only two days after pillaging the temple, giving the king no time to mint currency.{{sfn|Houghton|Lorber|Hoover|2008|p=449}}|group=note}}{{sfn|Houghton|Lorber|Hoover|2008|p=449}}\n\nThough his last coins were issued in 190 SE (123/122 BC), ancient historians do not provide the explicit date of Alexander II's death.{{sfn|Sch\u00fcrer|1973|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oG5jAgAAQBAJ&pg=132 132]}} He probably died by October 123 BC since the first Antiochene coins of Antiochus VIII were issued in 190 SE (123/122 BC).{{sfn|Ehling|1998|p=150}}{{sfn|Bellinger|1949|p=65}} Damascus kept striking coinage in the name of Alexander II until 191 SE (122/121 BC), when the forces of Antiochus VIII took it.{{sfn|Bellinger|1949|p=65}} According to Diodorus Siculus, many who witnessed the king's end \"remarked in various ways on the fickleness of fate, the reversals in human fortunes, the sudden turns of tide, and how changeable life could be, far beyond what anyone would expect\".{{sfn|Stronk|2016|p=523}} No wife or children of Alexander II, if he had any, are known;{{sfn|Ogden|1999|p= 152}} with his death, the line of Antiochus IV became extinct.{{sfn|Wright|2008|p=538}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Asia}}\n* [[List of Syrian monarchs]]\n* [[Timeline of Syrian history]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note|colwidth=40em}}\n\n==References==\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Joel|year= 2019|title=The Roman Republic in the Hellenistic Mediterranean: From Alexander to Caesar|publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]]|isbn=978-1-118-95933-6|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|last=Anson|first=Edward M.|year= 2015|title=Eumenes of Cardia: A Greek among Macedonians|edition=second|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]|series=Mnemosyne, Supplements, History and Archaeology of Classical Antiquity|volume=383|issn=2352-8656|isbn=978-9-004-29717-3|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Israel_Numismatic_Journal.html?id=t1RmAAAAMAAJ|last1=Barag|first1=Dan|last2=Qedar|first2=Shraga|year= 1980|title=The Beginning of Hasmonean Coinage|journal=Israel Numismatic Journal|publisher=Israel Numismatic Society|volume=4|issn=0021-2288|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Bellinger|first=Alfred R.|year= 1949|title=The End of the Seleucids|journal=Transactions of the Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences|publisher=[[Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences]]|volume=38|oclc=4520682|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.181878/page/n275|last1=Bevan|first1=Edwyn Robert|year= 1902|title=The House of Seleucus|volume=II|publisher=[[Edward Arnold (publisher)|Edward Arnold]]|oclc=499314408|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|series=Approaching the Ancient World|volume=2|last=Biers|first=William R.|year=1992|title=Art, Artefacts and Chronology in Classical Archaeology|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=978-0-415-06319-7|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/histoiredessle01bouc#page/392/mode/2up|title=Histoire des S\u00e9leucides (323-64 avant J.-C.)|language=fr|first=Auguste|last=Bouch\u00e9-Leclercq|publisher= Ernest Leroux|year= 1913|oclc=558064110|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|url=http://essays.wls.wels.net/handle/123456789/782?show=full|last=Brug|first=John F.|year= 1981|title=An Interdisciplinary Study of the \"A\" Coins of Yehochanan|journal=The Augur: Journal of the Biblical Numismatic Society|publisher= Biblical Numismatic Society|volume=31/32|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=Kings and Usurpers in the Seleukid Empire: The Men who Would be King|first=Boris|last=Chrubasik|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|series=Oxford Classical Monographs|year= 2016|isbn=978-0-198-78692-4|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite book|title=The Hellenistic Settlements in Syria, the Red Sea Basin, and North Africa|first=Getzel M.|last=Cohen|year= 2006|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|series=Hellenistic Culture and Society|volume=46|isbn=978-0-520-93102-2|ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/classical-review/article/fischer-thomas-untersuchungen-zum-partherkrieg-antiochos-vii-im-rahmen-der-seleukidengeschichte-munchen-diss-pp-ix-125-1-map-tubingen-privately-printed-1970-obtainable-from-the-author-heinleinstrasse-28-74-tubingenderendingen-paper-dm12/5697C9463EAF8E816455646D85B7D041|last=Colledge|first=Malcolm A.

The Nepal office headquarters is in Tutepani, Lalitpur-14. In 1996 it established Lalgadh Leprosy Services Centre, a hospital in Lalgadh, [[Dhanusa district]] in the southeast part of the country.\n\nThe Self Care Training Centre run from the hospital is still a key service for patients who have been damaged by leprosy, as they learn how to live with anaesthetic hands or feet or other problems, without making matters worse.  There are many skills that they need to learn, which help prevent further [[ulcers]] and damage.  Two weeks in the SCTC teaches them the main skills, and also links them with a self-help group local to their home.\n\nThe community development work at Lalgadh has been a major part of their work since 2000, ever since it was recognised that the key to beating leprosy lies in changing the attitudes of ordinary people living in the community.  This work has already improved the lives of many destitute people affected by leprosy, but has also transformed whole communities.  The key has been to empower people affected by leprosy to help their communities actively in practical ways. Many of them were marginalised and treated as human debris, not to be included in village life and certainly not useful.  The major community development programmes \u2013 STEP and RECLAIM \u2013 enable them to work together and initiate projects in their own villages for water, sanitation etc.\n\nThe hospital also has the Village Alive Programme which is working with 6 extremely poor villages in their work area.  They are in bad shape, but each has a nucleus of trust in one of their existing self-help groups connected to the village.

The Nepal office headquarters is in Tutepani, Lalitpur-14. In 1996 it established Lalgadh Leprosy Services Centre, a hospital in Lalgadh, [[Dhanusa district]] in the southeast part of the country.\n\nThe Self Care Training Centre run from the hospital is still a key service for patients who have been damaged by leprosy, as they learn how to live with anaesthetic hands or feet or other problems, without making matters worse.  There are many skills that they need to learn, which help prevent further ulcers and damage.  Two weeks in the SCTC teaches them the main skills, and also links them with a self-help group local to their home.\n\nThe community development work at Lalgadh has been a major part of their work since 2000, ever since it was recognised that the key to beating leprosy lies in changing the attitudes of ordinary people living in the community.  This work has already improved the lives of many destitute people affected by leprosy, but has also transformed whole communities.  The key has been to empower people affected by leprosy to help their communities actively in practical ways. Many of them were marginalised and treated as human debris, not to be included in village life and certainly not useful.  The major community development programmes \u2013 STEP and RECLAIM \u2013 enable them to work together and initiate projects in their own villages for water, sanitation etc.\n\nThe hospital also has the Village Alive Programme which is working with 6 extremely poor villages in their work area.  They are in bad shape, but each has a nucleus of trust in one of their existing self-help groups connected to the village.  Their Field Staff work with them to identify problem areas and help them find ways of solving them.  These tend to focus on issues such as health, education, sanitation etc.  Farmers' groups, women's groups have also been started;  the different groups run saving schemes which have enabled group members to start businesses and carry out village projects such as the building of proper toilets.\n\nEvery year in November the Hospital runs a Hand Surgery Camp.

Use [[Cite web]] or similar to provide source details.}}</ref>\n\nSince the Volkswagen Group is German, official [[internal combustion engine]] performance ratings are published using the [[International System of Units]] (commonly abbreviated \"SI\"), a modern form of the [[metric system]] of figures. Motor vehicle engines will have been tested by a [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung]] (DIN) accredited testing facility, to either the original ''[[directive 80/1269/EEC|80/1269/]][[European Economic Community|EEC]]'', or the later ''1999/99/[[European Economic Community|EC]]'' standards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  The standard initial measuring unit for establishing the rated motive [[power (physics)|power]] output is the [[watt#Kilowatt|kilowatt]] (kW);{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and in their official literature, the power rating may be published in either the kW, or the [[horsepower#PS|'Pferdest\u00e4rke']] (PS, which is sometimes incorrectly referred to as 'metric horsepower'), or both, and may also include conversions to imperial units such as the [[horsepower]] (hp) or [[horsepower#Brake horsepower|brake horsepower]] (bhp).  ([[conversion of units#Power or heat flow rate|Conversions]]: one&nbsp;PS \u02dc 735.5&nbsp;[[watt]]s (W), \u02dc 0.98632&nbsp;hp (SAE)). In case of conflict, the metric power figure of kilowatts (kW) will be stated as the primary figure of reference. For the turning force generated by the engine, the [[Newton metre]] (Nm) will be the reference figure of [[torque]]. Furthermore, in accordance with European automotive traditions, engines shall be listed in the following ''ascending'' order of preference:{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n#Number of cylinders,\n#Engine displacement (in [[litre]]s),\n#Engine configuration, and\n#Rated [[Power (physics)|motive]] power output (in kilowatts).\n\nThe petrol engines which Volkswagen Group previously manufactured and installed are in the '''''[[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines]]''''' article.\n{{inc-transport}}\n\n==EA111==\nThe '''EA111''' series of internal combustion engines was introduced in the mid-1970s in the [[Audi 50]], and shortly after in the original [[Volkswagen Polo]]. It is a series of water-cooled [[straight-three engine|inline three-]] and [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]] petrol and [[diesel engine]]s, in a variety of displacement sizes. This [[overhead camshaft]] engine features a [[crossflow cylinder head]] design. The camshaft is driven by a toothed belt from the crankshaft, this belt also provides the drive for an intermediate shaft that internally operates the oil pump and ignition distributor. Other \"V\" belt driven accessories are the water cooling pump, alternator and (if fitted) power steering. In transverse mount configuration the exhaust side is towards the vehicle firewall, in longitudinal configuration the exhaust side is to the right as you face front in either left or right hand drive vehicles.\n\n==EA211==\nThe '''EA211''' engines are a completely new four-cylinder turbocharged and direct-injection TSI engines. Compared to its predecessor, the '''EA211''' series is significantly more compact, with installation length {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} shorter, thus offering more interior space. The installation position of the engines has also been optimised. Just as in the diesels, the petrol engines are now mounted with the exhaust side facing backwards and tilted at an angle of 12 degrees. The weight of these petrol engines made of die-cast aluminium is only {{convert|97|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for the 1.2 TSI and {{convert|106|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for the 1.4 TSI. The crankshaft alone became lighter by 20 per cent; the connecting rods lost 30 per cent of their weight. In addition the connecting rod bearing journals are now hollow-drilled and pistons now come with flat bottoms, all of them optimized for lower weight.\nRegarding thermal management, the '''EA211''' petrol engine is equipped with a modern dual-circuit cooling system. That means that a high temperature circuit with a mechanically driven cooling pump cools the basic engine, while a low temperature circuit flows through the intercooler and the turbo-charger casing. The cylinder-head circuit heats the cabin's interior. The exhaust manifold is integrated into the cylinder head, enabling the engine to warm up more quickly, in turn making heat available quickly for the passenger cabin. At high loads, the exhaust is cooled by the coolant, lowering fuel consumption.\n\n==EA 824, EA 825==\n'''EA 824''' and '''EA 825''' are families of twin turbo 90 degrees V8 spark ignition engines.\n\nAudi uses the EA 824, while Porsche uses EA 825 for Panamera Turbo.<ref>[http://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/techday-on-combustion-engine-technology-8738/efficiency-and-driving-pleasure-innovative-v-engines-at-audi-8748 Efficiency and driving pleasure: innovative V engines at Audi]</ref>\n\nEA 825 uses two twin-scroll turbochargers, iron coating on the cylinder linings, {{convert|250|bar|psi|0|abbr=on}} fuel injector at centre of combustion chamber, cylinder deactivation at 950-3500rpm with a {{convert|250|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} torque limit.<ref>[http://articles.sae.org/14923/ Inside Porsche's new V8 and V6 powertrains]</ref>\n\n==EA 839==\n'''EA 839''' is a family of turbocharged 90 degrees V6 spark ignition engines.

The EA888 family is an Audi-designed unit that features some of the latest engine technology such as direct fuel injection, sintered camshaft lobes, thin-walled engine block, variable valve timing and lift for intake and exhaust valves, downstream oxygen sensors, exhaust manifold integrated into cylinder head, [[exhaust gas recirculation]] and cooling, distributorless coil-on-plug ignition, lightweight engine internals, slide valve thermostat (some variants), and the addition of port fuel injection to aid low load fuel consumption and cold start emissions. The port fuel injection also aids in reducing the potential carbon deposits that can occur in direct injected engines. As of 2016, the 'dual injection' system has not been offered in North American markets. Still, Volkswagen has made numerous enhancements to their engine designs such as the positive crankcase ventilation, repositioning injectors and more to lessen the potential that carbon deposits accumulate on intake valves. Currently, the EA888 engine is available in two sizes: 1.8T and 2.0T. Engine output ranges from {{convert|111|kW|PS bhp|0}} to over {{convert|223|kW|PS bhp|0}}. A concept car based on the Volkswagen Golf R, dubbed R400, produced 395&nbsp;hp from 2 litres of displacement. Furthermore, the R400 would be able to accelerate from 0\u2013100 in just 3.8 seconds, thanks to a [[Haldex Traction|haldex]] 4-wheel drive system, and a 6-speed DSG gearbox.\n\n==Three-cylinder petrols{{anchor|3}}==\n:''This section is about '''''current''''' three-cylinder petrol engines, for '''''discontinued''''' three-cylinder petrol engines, see [[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines#Three cylinder EA111 petrols]]\n\n==={{anchor|CHYA|CHYB|CSEB|DHSB}} 1.0 R3 12v (EA211)===\nThe new fuel-saving engine presented at the 2012 [[Geneva Motor Show]]\n;identification:parts code prefix: 04E, ID code: CHYA, CHYB, CSEB, DHSB\n;engine displacement & engine configuration: {{convert|999|cc|L|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} [[Straight-three engine|inline three engine]] (R3/I3);

Its [[engine downsizing|displacement downsizing]] leads to improved fuel economy, with 14% more power than the 2.0&nbsp;FSI, but consuming 5% less fuel. The mechanical supercharger compressor, driven at 5&nbsp;times the speed of the crankshaft, mainly operates at low engine speeds from idle up to 2,400&nbsp;revolutions per minute (rpm) to increase low-end torque. At engine speeds just above idle, the belt-driven supercharger provides a boost pressure of {{convert|1.75|bar|psi|1|abbr=}}. The turbocharger assumes full effectiveness at middle revs, and the engine map disengages the clutch-controlled supercharger at a maximum upper limit of 3,500&nbsp;rpm; the supercharger will then be bypassed once the turbocharger spools up and reaches sufficient speed to provide adequate boost in the upper rev-ranges. This engine is made at Volkswagen-Motorenfertigung, [[Chemnitz]].\n\nIn 2007, Volkswagen announced the 90&nbsp;kW model which will replace the [[#1.6 FSI 85kW|1.6 FSI {{convert|85|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}]] engine. This engine differs from the 103&nbsp;kW and 125&nbsp;kW models in several ways. It uses only one method of forced induction \u2013 a turbocharger (and not a supercharger), and has water-cooled intercooler. The engine has reduced frictional losses, optimised camshafts, new intake ports, and new high-pressure injector valves.

[[Gy\u0151r]], Hungary; and [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], Mexico. Output varies based on internal component selection, turbocharger, and [[engine control unit]] (ECU) software. This ubiquitous power plant has been extensively used in all four mainstream [[Volkswagen Group]] marques, along with [[Volkswagen Industrial Motor]] applications.\n\nThis engine is also used in a very high state of tune in the one-make [[Formula Palmer Audi]] (FPA) [[open wheel car|open-wheeled]] [[auto racing]] series. It develops {{convert|300|bhp|kW PS|0}}, with an extra {{convert|60|bhp|kW PS|0}} available from a driver operated 'push-to-pass' turbo boost button. Based entirely on road-car production engines and prepared and built by [[Mountune Racing]], it only differs by utilising a [[Pi Research]] [[Pectel]] electronic fuel injection and a water-cooled [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] T34 turbocharger with closed-loop boost control.\n\nFurthermore, an even higher 'step up' version of this engine is used in the later [[Europe]]an-based [[FIA Formula Two Championship (2009\u20132012)|FIA Formula Two Championship]]. Developed as a pure race engine and again built by Mountune Racing, this variant includes many all-new lightweight components, and has been converted to a [[dry sump]] [[motor oil|lubrication]] system. For its initial [[2009 FIA Formula Two Championship season|2009 season]], it produced a continuous maximum power of {{convert|400|bhp|kW PS|0}} at 8,250&nbsp;revolutions per minute (rpm), and includes a limited duration 'overboost' to {{convert|450|bhp|kW PS|0}}, aided by an all-new Garrett GT35 turbocharger and a Pi Research Pectel MQ12 ECU.

It was wholly designed and developed by [[Audi|AUDI AG]]. The only common feature with its predecessors is the sharing of the same {{convert|88|mm|2}} cylinder spacing \u2013 which keeps the engine length relatively short, meaning it can be installed either [[transverse engine|transversely]] or [[longitudinal engine|longitudinally]]. [[gray iron|Grey]] [[cast iron]] (GJL 250) remains the choice material for the cylinder block and crankcase, due to its inherent good acoustic dampening properties. This all-new EA888 range is notable for utilising simplex roller chains to drive the two overhead camshafts, instead of the former engines' toothed-rubber [[Timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]]. Like the final developments of the former EA113 engine generation, all EA888s only use the Audi-created [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) direct injection. Furthermore, EA888 engines are also able to utilise the Audi-developed 'valvelift' technology, which complements the existing [[variable valve timing]]. This new family of engines is scheduled to be universally available for all markets on five continents, within all marques of the [[Volkswagen Group]]. The former EA113 range still remains in production.\n\nGrainger & Worrall was reported to have cast 50 CGI cylinder blocks for over 12 months as of October 2013, based on the EA888 gasoline engine.<ref>[http://autoindustrynewsletter.blogspot.ca/2013/10/cgi-confirmed-for-four-cylinder-engine.html SCOOP: CGI set for four-cylinder engine blocks]</ref>\n\n===1.8 R4 16v TSI/TFSI (EA888){{Anchor|1.8R4EA888|BYJ|CDAA|CDAB}}===\n;identification: parts code prefix: 06H, 06J;

Mainly affecting the Longitudinal Audi applications between 2008 and 2012 (most commonly the 8K / B8 A4 8T / 8F B8 A5 & 8R Q5). In rare occurrences it affects the Transverse applications in the 8P Audi A3, 8J Audi TT and in even rarer occasions would affect the MK6 Volkswagen Golf GTI and lower powered Sciroccos etc. that were not fitted with the EA113 family of engines. In even more extreme cases it would affect the Generation 3 from 2013 to present day. The rectification for this is performed after a two part oil consumption test is carried out by a main dealer, The vehicle will need to be burning more than approximately a metric litre per 1,000 KM or 600 miles, or if the top up oil warning illuminates on the instrument cluster. Only after this test is carried out and an agreement of payment by the manufacturer & customer contribution is agreed the repair can be carried out only by main dealers and manufacturer approved repairers. The rectification that is carried out is to remove the engine, replace the Piston & Connecting Rod assemblies in all four cylinders with modified units, head gasket and so forth. From late 2012, the modified internal engine components were fitted to new replacement engines and new vehicle units by the Volkswagen group engine plants.\n\nAnother common issue is camshaft timing chain tensioner failure, again in earlier generation 1 models. This was due to the design of the retaining element that after higher mileages and / or premature wear stopped the tensioner from holding the tension in the timing chain. If in the case of this component \nfailing, the chain would jump, allowing the pistons and valves to potentially hit each other, causing expensive and possibly terminal engine damage. Along with the earlier mentioned oil consumption issues, this was eventually addressed by the Volkswagen Group engine plants, Who fitted a modified (internally known as Version 2) tensioner that is retained by a much more reliable spring retainer instead. \n\nThe final mainstream common issue affects all EA888 generations. The cooling system is mainly a problem free system, with the exception of the plastic thermostat unit, these are very commonly known to be prone to leaks, with no specific part of the housing known to leak. On the EA888, the thermostat unit also includes the coolant pump, on the Generation 3 & 4 the coolant pump is still part of the thermostat, however is available separately. The coolant pump / thermostat unit is located under the intake manifold regardless of generation, model year or application. The thermostat side is joined by a plastic union directly to the engine oil cooler, which in turn is mounted to and is an integral part of the ancillary / alternator bracket (also includes the oil filter housing in all generations and applications). The coolant pump is driven by the intake side balance shaft, on the flywheel side of the engine. The rectification is to renew the thermostat unit with a modified unit, and if needed in later models, the coolant pump if necessary. However these newer units are still known to leak. There have currently been no further modifications to the design of this to combat the issues by Volkswagen Group.\n\n===== Turbo<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2014-audi-s3-golf-r-and-leon-cupra-developing-turbo-problems-84773.html|title=2014 Audi S3, Golf R and Leon Cupra Developing Turbo Problems|last=Radu|first=Mihnea|date=2014-08-04|website=autoevolution|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> =====\nThe MQB platform suffers from early turbocharger failure. This affects models like the Audi S3, Golf 7 R/GTI and the Seat Cupra models. More so: models build before 2015 are more prone to failure. This can be caused because there is shaft play due to a badly fixed screw or because of the manifold sealing surface.\n\n====== List of turbos<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.golfmk7.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5276|title=Got a bad turbo?

Motor vehicle engines will have been tested by a [[Deutsches Institut f\u00fcr Normung]] (DIN) accredited testing facility, to either the original ''[[directive 80/1269/EEC|80/1269/]][[European Economic Community|EEC]]'', or the later ''1999/99/[[European Economic Community|EC]]'' standards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  The standard initial measuring unit for establishing the rated motive [[power (physics)|power]] output is the [[watt#Kilowatt|kilowatt]] (kW);{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and in their official literature, the power rating may be published in either the kW, or the [[horsepower#PS|'Pferdest\u00e4rke']] (PS, which is sometimes incorrectly referred to as 'metric horsepower'), or both, and may also include conversions to imperial units such as the [[horsepower]] (hp) or [[horsepower#Brake horsepower|brake horsepower]] (bhp).  ([[conversion of units#Power or heat flow rate|Conversions]]: one&nbsp;PS \u02dc 735.5&nbsp;[[watt]]s (W), \u02dc 0.98632&nbsp;hp (SAE)). In case of conflict, the metric power figure of kilowatts (kW) will be stated as the primary figure of reference. For the turning force generated by the engine, the [[Newton metre]] (Nm) will be the reference figure of [[torque]]. Furthermore, in accordance with European automotive traditions, engines shall be listed in the following ''ascending'' order of preference:{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n#Number of cylinders,\n#Engine displacement (in [[litre]]s),\n#Engine configuration, and\n#Rated [[Power (physics)|motive]] power output (in kilowatts).\n\nThe petrol engines which Volkswagen Group previously manufactured and installed are in the '''''[[list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines]]''''' article.\n{{inc-transport}}\n\n==EA111==\nThe '''EA111''' series of internal combustion engines was introduced in the mid-1970s in the [[Audi 50]], and shortly after in the original [[Volkswagen Polo]]. It is a series of water-cooled [[straight-three engine|inline three-]] and [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]] petrol and [[diesel engine]]s, in a variety of displacement sizes. This [[overhead camshaft]] engine features a [[crossflow cylinder head]] design. The camshaft is driven by a toothed belt from the crankshaft, this belt also provides the drive for an intermediate shaft that internally operates the oil pump and ignition distributor. Other \"V\" belt driven accessories are the water cooling pump, alternator and (if fitted) power steering. In transverse mount configuration the exhaust side is towards the vehicle firewall, in longitudinal configuration the exhaust side is to the right as you face front in either left or right hand drive vehicles.\n\n==EA211==\nThe '''EA211''' engines are a completely new four-cylinder turbocharged and direct-injection TSI engines. Compared to its predecessor, the '''EA211''' series is significantly more compact, with installation length {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} shorter, thus offering more interior space. The installation position of the engines has also been optimised. Just as in the diesels, the petrol engines are now mounted with the exhaust side facing backwards and tilted at an angle of 12 degrees. The weight of these petrol engines made of die-cast aluminium is only {{convert|97|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for the 1.2 TSI and {{convert|106|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for the 1.4 TSI. The crankshaft alone became lighter by 20 per cent; the connecting rods lost 30 per cent of their weight. In addition the connecting rod bearing journals are now hollow-drilled and pistons now come with flat bottoms, all of them optimized for lower weight.\nRegarding thermal management, the '''EA211''' petrol engine is equipped with a modern dual-circuit cooling system. That means that a high temperature circuit with a mechanically driven cooling pump cools the basic engine, while a low temperature circuit flows through the intercooler and the turbo-charger casing. The cylinder-head circuit heats the cabin's interior. The exhaust manifold is integrated into the cylinder head, enabling the engine to warm up more quickly, in turn making heat available quickly for the passenger cabin. At high loads, the exhaust is cooled by the coolant, lowering fuel consumption.\n\n==EA 824, EA 825==\n'''EA 824''' and '''EA 825''' are families of twin turbo 90 degrees V8 spark ignition engines.\n\nAudi uses the EA 824, while Porsche uses EA 825 for Panamera Turbo.<ref>[http://www.audi-mediacenter.com/en/techday-on-combustion-engine-technology-8738/efficiency-and-driving-pleasure-innovative-v-engines-at-audi-8748 Efficiency and driving pleasure: innovative V engines at Audi]</ref>\n\nEA 825 uses two twin-scroll turbochargers, iron coating on the cylinder linings, {{convert|250|bar|psi|0|abbr=on}} fuel injector at centre of combustion chamber, cylinder deactivation at 950-3500rpm with a {{convert|250|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} torque limit.<ref>[http://articles.sae.org/14923/ Inside Porsche's new V8 and V6 powertrains]</ref>\n\n==EA 839==\n'''EA 839''' is a family of turbocharged 90 degrees V6 spark ignition engines. It includes steel cylinder liners, balancer shaft located within the vee, maximum compression ratio of 11.2:1, bore and stroke of {{convert|84.5|x|89|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://articles.sae.org/15533/ New 90-degree turbo V6 leads Audi's hybridization blitz]</ref>\n\n==EA888==\nThe '''EA888''' engines are a family of three and four cylinder engines that are currently in use across the Volkswagen Group. The EA888 family is an Audi-designed unit that features some of the latest engine technology such as direct fuel injection, sintered camshaft lobes, thin-walled engine block, variable valve timing and lift for intake and exhaust valves, downstream oxygen sensors, exhaust manifold integrated into cylinder head, [[exhaust gas recirculation]] and cooling, distributorless coil-on-plug ignition, lightweight engine internals, slide valve thermostat (some variants), and the addition of port fuel injection to aid low load fuel consumption and cold start emissions. The port fuel injection also aids in reducing the potential carbon deposits that can occur in direct injected engines. As of 2016, the 'dual injection' system has not been offered in North American markets. Still, Volkswagen has made numerous enhancements to their engine designs such as the positive crankcase ventilation, repositioning injectors and more to lessen the potential that carbon deposits accumulate on intake valves. Currently, the EA888 engine is available in two sizes: 1.8T and 2.0T. Engine output ranges from {{convert|111|kW|PS bhp|0}} to over {{convert|223|kW|PS bhp|0}}. A concept car based on the Volkswagen Golf R, dubbed R400, produced 395&nbsp;hp from 2 litres of displacement.

Its [[engine downsizing|displacement downsizing]] leads to improved fuel economy, with 14% more power than the 2.0&nbsp;FSI, but consuming 5% less fuel. The mechanical supercharger compressor, driven at 5&nbsp;times the speed of the crankshaft, mainly operates at low engine speeds from idle up to 2,400&nbsp;revolutions per minute (rpm) to increase low-end torque. At engine speeds just above idle, the belt-driven supercharger provides a boost pressure of {{convert|1.75|bar|psi|1|abbr=}}. The turbocharger assumes full effectiveness at middle revs, and the engine map disengages the clutch-controlled supercharger at a maximum upper limit of 3,500&nbsp;rpm; the supercharger will then be bypassed once the turbocharger spools up and reaches sufficient speed to provide adequate boost in the upper rev-ranges. This engine is made at Volkswagen-Motorenfertigung, [[Chemnitz]].\n\nIn 2007, Volkswagen announced the 90&nbsp;kW model which will replace the [[#1.6 FSI 85kW|1.6 FSI {{convert|85|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}]] engine. This engine differs from the 103&nbsp;kW and 125&nbsp;kW models in several ways. It uses only one method of forced induction \u2013 a turbocharger (and not a supercharger), and has water-cooled intercooler. The engine has reduced frictional losses, optimised camshafts, new intake ports, and new high-pressure injector valves. It is also {{convert|14|kg|0}} lighter than the 125&nbsp;kW model, in order to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions.\n{{See also|Volkswagen G60 engine}}\n;identification: parts code prefix: 03C, ID codes: BLG, BMY, CAXC\n;engine displacement & engine configuration: {{convert|1390|cc|1}} inline-four engine (R4/I4);

[[Gy\u0151r]], Hungary; and [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]], Mexico. Output varies based on internal component selection, turbocharger, and [[engine control unit]] (ECU) software. This ubiquitous power plant has been extensively used in all four mainstream [[Volkswagen Group]] marques, along with [[Volkswagen Industrial Motor]] applications.\n\nThis engine is also used in a very high state of tune in the one-make [[Formula Palmer Audi]] (FPA) [[open wheel car|open-wheeled]] [[auto racing]] series. It develops {{convert|300|bhp|kW PS|0}}, with an extra {{convert|60|bhp|kW PS|0}} available from a driver operated 'push-to-pass' turbo boost button. Based entirely on road-car production engines and prepared and built by [[Mountune Racing]], it only differs by utilising a [[Pi Research]] [[Pectel]] electronic fuel injection and a water-cooled [[Garrett AiResearch|Garrett]] T34 turbocharger with closed-loop boost control.\n\nFurthermore, an even higher 'step up' version of this engine is used in the later [[Europe]]an-based [[FIA Formula Two Championship (2009\u20132012)|FIA Formula Two Championship]]. Developed as a pure race engine and again built by Mountune Racing, this variant includes many all-new lightweight components, and has been converted to a [[dry sump]] [[motor oil|lubrication]] system. For its initial [[2009 FIA Formula Two Championship season|2009 season]], it produced a continuous maximum power of {{convert|400|bhp|kW PS|0}} at 8,250&nbsp;revolutions per minute (rpm), and includes a limited duration 'overboost' to {{convert|450|bhp|kW PS|0}}, aided by an all-new Garrett GT35 turbocharger and a Pi Research Pectel MQ12 ECU. From the [[2010 FIA Formula Two Championship season|2010 season]], base power is increased to {{convert|425|bhp|kW PS|0}}, and with overboost to {{convert|480|bhp|kW PS|0}}.\n;identification: parts code prefix: 058, 06A, 06B\n;engine displacement & engine configuration: {{convert|1781|cc|1}} [[inline-four engine]] (R4/I4); bore x stroke: {{convert|81.0|x|86.4|mm|2}}, stroke ratio: 0.94:1 \u2013 undersquare/long-stroke, 445.2&nbsp;cc per cylinder, compression ratio: 9.0\u20139.5:1\n;cylinder block & crankcase: grey cast iron; five main bearings, die-forged steel crankshaft, fracture-split forged steel connecting rods, [[Mahle GmbH|Mahle]] forged aluminium alloy pistons\n;cylinder head & valvetrain: cast aluminium alloy; [[multi-valve|five valves]] per cylinder, 20 valves total, hydraulic bucket tappets, timing belt-driven double overhead camshaft (DOHC) with [[variable valve timing|variable inlet valve timing]]\n;aspiration: cast aluminium alloy intake manifold, turbocharger, intercooler\n;fuel system, ignition system & engine management: multi-point electronic sequential [[indirect injection|indirect]] fuel injection with four intake manifold-sited fuel injectors; mapped direct ignition with four individual direct-acting [[ignition coil|single spark coils]]; [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] [[Motronic]] ME&nbsp;7.5  (MBE&nbsp;975F on Industrial variants) electronic [[engine control unit]] (ECU), red line: 6,500&nbsp;rpm, rev limit 6,800&nbsp;rpm\nMass<br>149&nbsp;kg ('BAM' engine, dry)\n;DIN-rated motive power & torque outputs, ID codes, applications\n:{{convert|110|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,800 rpm; {{convert|210|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 1,750\u20134,600 rpm \u2014 '''AEB, AGU, AJH, APH, ARX, ARZ, ATW, AUM, AWC, AWD, AWL, AWT, AWW, BJX, BKF, BKV'''\n::[[Volkswagen Polo|VW Polo GTI]], [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|VW Golf Mk4 GTI]], [[Volkswagen Bora|VW Bora]], [[Volkswagen New Beetle|VW New Beetle]], [[Volkswagen Passat (B5)|VW Passat B5]] and [[Volkswagen Jetta#1J|VW Sagitar]].[[Volkswagen Sharan#Engines|VW Sharan .]] Also on the [[Audi TT#8N|Audi TT Mk1 (8N)]], [[Audi A3]] (first gen.), [[Audi A4]], [[Audi A6]], [[\u0160koda Octavia]], [[\u0160koda Superb]] (first gen.) and [[SEAT Ibiza]].\n:{{convert|110|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,700 rpm; {{convert|220|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 1,800 rpm \u2014 EU5 rated: '''CFMA'''\n::[[SEAT Exeo]] (CFMA: 12/08-on)\n:{{convert|115|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} \u2014 '''AQX, AYP'''\n::[[SEAT Ibiza|SEAT Ibiza Mk3 Cupra, Cupra R]], [[SEAT C\u00f3rdoba|SEAT Cordoba Cupra]]\n:{{convert|120|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,700 rpm; {{convert|225|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 1,950\u20134,700 rpm \u2014 '''BFB, BKB, BVP, CED'''\n::replaced the 110 kW version in 2003 on most models; [[Audi A4#B6 (Typ 8E/8H; 2001\u20132006)|Audi A4]], [[Audi TT]]\n:{{convert|125|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} at 5,900 rpm; {{convert|225|Nm|0|abbr=on}} at 1,950\u20135,000 rpm \u2014 '''[[Volkswagen Audi Group AMB Engine|AMB]], AWM'''\n::[[Audi A4]], [[Volkswagen Passat|VW Passat]], [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]], [[Volkswagen Jetta|VW Jetta]].

It was wholly designed and developed by [[Audi|AUDI AG]]. The only common feature with its predecessors is the sharing of the same {{convert|88|mm|2}} cylinder spacing \u2013 which keeps the engine length relatively short, meaning it can be installed either [[transverse engine|transversely]] or [[longitudinal engine|longitudinally]]. [[gray iron|Grey]] [[cast iron]] (GJL 250) remains the choice material for the cylinder block and crankcase, due to its inherent good acoustic dampening properties. This all-new EA888 range is notable for utilising simplex roller chains to drive the two overhead camshafts, instead of the former engines' toothed-rubber [[Timing belt (camshaft)|timing belt]]. Like the final developments of the former EA113 engine generation, all EA888s only use the Audi-created [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI) direct injection. Furthermore, EA888 engines are also able to utilise the Audi-developed 'valvelift' technology, which complements the existing [[variable valve timing]]. This new family of engines is scheduled to be universally available for all markets on five continents, within all marques of the [[Volkswagen Group]]. The former EA113 range still remains in production.\n\nGrainger & Worrall was reported to have cast 50 CGI cylinder blocks for over 12 months as of October 2013, based on the EA888 gasoline engine.<ref>[http://autoindustrynewsletter.blogspot.ca/2013/10/cgi-confirmed-for-four-cylinder-engine.html SCOOP: CGI set for four-cylinder engine blocks]</ref>\n\n===1.8 R4 16v TSI/TFSI (EA888){{Anchor|1.8R4EA888|BYJ|CDAA|CDAB}}===\n;identification: parts code prefix: 06H, 06J;

Mainly affecting the Longitudinal Audi applications between 2008 and 2012 (most commonly the 8K / B8 A4 8T / 8F B8 A5 & 8R Q5). In rare occurrences it affects the Transverse applications in the 8P Audi A3, 8J Audi TT and in even rarer occasions would affect the MK6 Volkswagen Golf GTI and lower powered Sciroccos etc. that were not fitted with the EA113 family of engines. In even more extreme cases it would affect the Generation 3 from 2013 to present day. The rectification for this is performed after a two part oil consumption test is carried out by a main dealer, The vehicle will need to be burning more than approximately a metric litre per 1,000 KM or 600 miles, or if the top up oil warning illuminates on the instrument cluster. Only after this test is carried out and an agreement of payment by the manufacturer & customer contribution is agreed the repair can be carried out only by main dealers and manufacturer approved repairers. The rectification that is carried out is to remove the engine, replace the Piston & Connecting Rod assemblies in all four cylinders with modified units, head gasket and so forth. From late 2012, the modified internal engine components were fitted to new replacement engines and new vehicle units by the Volkswagen group engine plants.\n\nAnother common issue is camshaft timing chain tensioner failure, again in earlier generation 1 models. This was due to the design of the retaining element that after higher mileages and / or premature wear stopped the tensioner from holding the tension in the timing chain. If in the case of this component \nfailing, the chain would jump, allowing the pistons and valves to potentially hit each other, causing expensive and possibly terminal engine damage. Along with the earlier mentioned oil consumption issues, this was eventually addressed by the Volkswagen Group engine plants, Who fitted a modified (internally known as Version 2) tensioner that is retained by a much more reliable spring retainer instead. \n\nThe final mainstream common issue affects all EA888 generations. The cooling system is mainly a problem free system, with the exception of the plastic thermostat unit, these are very commonly known to be prone to leaks, with no specific part of the housing known to leak. On the EA888, the thermostat unit also includes the coolant pump, on the Generation 3 & 4 the coolant pump is still part of the thermostat, however is available separately. The coolant pump / thermostat unit is located under the intake manifold regardless of generation, model year or application. The thermostat side is joined by a plastic union directly to the engine oil cooler, which in turn is mounted to and is an integral part of the ancillary / alternator bracket (also includes the oil filter housing in all generations and applications). The coolant pump is driven by the intake side balance shaft, on the flywheel side of the engine. The rectification is to renew the thermostat unit with a modified unit, and if needed in later models, the coolant pump if necessary. However these newer units are still known to leak. There have currently been no further modifications to the design of this to combat the issues by Volkswagen Group.\n\n===== Turbo<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2014-audi-s3-golf-r-and-leon-cupra-developing-turbo-problems-84773.html|title=2014 Audi S3, Golf R and Leon Cupra Developing Turbo Problems|last=Radu|first=Mihnea|date=2014-08-04|website=autoevolution|language=en|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref> =====\nThe MQB platform suffers from early turbocharger failure. This affects models like the Audi S3, Golf 7 R/GTI and the Seat Cupra models. More so: models build before 2015 are more prone to failure. This can be caused because there is shaft play due to a badly fixed screw or because of the manifold sealing surface.\n\n====== List of turbos<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.golfmk7.com/forums/showthread.php?t=5276|title=Got a bad turbo?

It is important in the elucidation of molecular events involved in [[circadian]] rhythms, [[epigenetics]] and [[gene silencing]], [[cell polarity]], [[cell fusion]], development, as well as many aspects of cell biology and biochemistry.\n\n==The sexual cycle==\n[[File:Neurospora crassa life cycle.jpg|thumb|600px|Neurospora crassa life cycle. The haploid mycelium reproduces asexually by two processes: (1) simple proliferation of existing mycelium, and (2) formation of conidia (macro- and micro-) which can be dispersed and then germinate to produce new mycelium.  In the sexual cycle, mating can only occur between individual strains of different mating type, A and a.  Fertilization occurs by the passage of nuclei of conidia or mycelium of one mating type into the protoperithecia of the opposite mating type through the trichogyne.  Fusion of the nuclei of opposite mating types occurs within the protoperithecium to form a zygote (2N) nucleus.]]\n\nSexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can only be formed when two mycelia of different mating type come together (see Figure).  Like other Ascomycetes, ''N. crassa'' has two mating types that, in this case, are symbolized by ''A'' and ''a''.  There is no evident morphological difference between the ''A'' and ''a'' mating type strains.  Both can form abundant protoperithecia, the female reproductive structure (see Figure).  Protoperithecia are formed most readily in the laboratory when growth occurs on solid (agar) synthetic medium with a relatively low source of nitrogen.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Westergaard M, Mitchell HK | year = 1947 | title = Neurospora.

A branched system of slender hyphae, called the trichogyne, extends from the tip of the ascogonium projecting beyond the sheathing hyphae into the air.  The sexual cycle is initiated (i.e. fertilization occurs) when a cell (usually a conidium) of opposite mating type contacts a part of the trichogyne (see Figure).  Such contact can be followed by cell fusion leading to one or more nuclei from the fertilizing cell migrating down the trichogyne into the ascogonium.  Since both ''A'' and ''a'' strains have the same sexual structures, neither strain can be regarded as exclusively male or female.  However, as a recipient, the protoperithecium of both the ''A'' and ''a'' strains can be thought of as the female structure, and the fertilizing conidium can be thought of as the male participant.\n\nThe subsequent steps following fusion of ''A'' and ''a'' haploid cells, have been outlined by Fincham and Day<ref>Fincham J RS, Day PR (1963). Fungal Genetics. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, UK. ASIN: B000W851KO</ref> and Wagner and Mitchell.<ref>Wagner RP, Mitchell HK. (1964).  Genetics and Metabolism.  John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York ASIN: B00BXTC5BO</ref>  After fusion of the cells, the further fusion of their nuclei is delayed.  Instead, a nucleus from the fertilizing cell and a nucleus from the ascogonium become associated and begin to divide synchronously.  The products of these nuclear divisions (still in pairs of unlike mating type, i.e. ''A/a'') migrate into numerous ascogenous hyphae, which then begin to grow out of the ascogonium.  Each of these ascogenous hypha bends to form a hook (or crozier) at its tip and the ''A'' and ''a'' pair of haploid nuclei within the crozier divide synchronously.  Next, septa form to divide the crozier into three cells.  The central cell in the curve of the hook contains one ''A'' and one ''a'' nucleus (see Figure).  This binuclear cell initiates ascus formation and is called an \"ascus-initial\" cell.  Next the two [[uninucleate]] cells on either side of the first ascus-forming cell fuse with each other to form a [[binucleated cells|binucleate cell]] that can grow to form a further crozier that can then form its own ascus-initial cell. This process can then be repeated multiple times.\n\nAfter formation of the ascus-initial cell, the ''A'' and ''a'' nucleus fuse with each other to form a diploid nucleus (see Figure).  This nucleus is the only diploid nucleus in the entire life cycle of ''N. crassa''.  The diploid nucleus has 14 chromosomes formed from the two fused haploid nuclei that had 7 chromosomes each.  Formation of the diploid nucleus is immediately followed by [[meiosis]].  The two sequential divisions of meiosis lead to four haploid nuclei, two of the ''A'' mating type and two of the ''a'' mating type.  One further mitotic division leads to four ''A'' and four ''a'' nucleus in each ascus.  Meiosis is an essential part of the life cycle of all sexually reproducing organisms, and in its main features, meiosis in ''N. crassa'' seems typical of meiosis generally.\n\nAs the above events are occurring, the mycelial sheath that had enveloped the ascogonium develops as the wall of the perithecium, becomes impregnated with melanin, and blackens.  The mature perithecium has a flask-shaped structure.\n\nA mature perithecium may contain as many as 300 asci, each derived from identical fusion diploid nuclei. Ordinarily, in nature, when the perithecia mature the ascospores are ejected rather violently into the air.  These ascospores are heat resistant and, in the lab, require heating at 60&nbsp;\u00b0C for 30 minutes to induce germination.  For normal strains, the entire sexual cycle takes 10 to 15 days.  In a mature ascus containing eight ascospores, pairs of adjacent spores are identical in genetic constitution, since the last division is mitotic, and since the ascospores are contained in the ascus sac that holds them in a definite order determined by the direction of nuclear segregations during meiosis. Since the four primary products are also arranged in sequence, a first division segregation pattern of genetic markers can be distinguished from a second division segregation pattern.\n\n==Fine structure genetic analysis==\nBecause of the above features ''N. crassa'' was found to be very useful for the study of genetic events occurring in individual meioses. Mature asci from a perithecium can be separated on a microscope slide and the spores experimentally manipulated.  These studies usually involved the separate culture of individual ascospores resulting from a single meiotic event and determining the genotype of each spore.  Studies of this type, carried out in several different laboratories, established the phenomenon of \"gene conversion\" (e.g. see references<ref name=Mitchell>{{cite journal |author=Mitchell MB |title=ABERRANT RECOMBINATION OF PYRIDOXINE MUTANTS OF Neurospora |journal=Proc.

This gene is necessary for the synthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), and mutants defective in this gene can be experimentally identified by their requirement for pantothenic acid in their growth medium. The two ''pan-2'' mutations B5 and B3 are located at different sites in the ''pan-2'' gene, so that a cross of B5 \u00b4 B3 yields wild-type recombinants at low frequency.<ref name=\"Case ME, Giles NH 1958 378\u201390\"/>  An analysis of 939 asci in which the genotypes of all meiotic products (ascospores) could be determined found 11 asci with an exceptional segregation pattern.  These included six asci in which there was one wild-type meiotic product but no expected reciprocal double-mutant (B5B3) product. Furthermore, in three asci the ratio of meiotic products was 1B5:3B3, rather than in the expected 2:2 ratio.  This study, as well as numerous additional studies in ''N. crassa'' and other fungi (reviewed by Whitehouse<ref>Whitehouse, HLK. (1982). Genetic Recombination. Wiley, New York {{ISBN|978-0471102052}}</ref>), led to an extensive characterization of gene conversion.  It became clear from this work that gene conversion events arise when a molecular recombination event happens to occur near the genetic markers under study (e.g. ''pan-2'' mutations in the above example).  Thus studies of gene conversion allowed insight into the details of the molecular mechanism of recombination.  Over the decades since the original observations of Mary Mitchell in 1955,<ref name=Mitchell /> a sequence of molecular models of recombination have been proposed based on both emerging genetic data from gene conversion studies and studies of the reaction capabilities of DNA.  Current understanding of the molecular mechanism of recombination is discussed in the Wikipedia articles [[Gene conversion]] and [[Genetic recombination]].  An understanding of recombination is relevant to several fundamental biologic problems, such the role of recombination and recombinational repair in cancer (see [[BRCA1]]) and the adaptive function of meiosis (see [[Meiosis]]).\n\n==Adaptive function of mating type==\nThat mating in ''N. crassa'' can only occur between strains of different mating type suggests that some degree of outcrossing is favored by natural selection.  In haploid multicellular fungi, such as ''N. crassa'', meiosis occurring in the brief diploid stage is one of their most complex processes.  The haploid multicellular vegetative stage, although physically much larger than the diploid stage, characteristically has a simple modular construction with little differentiation.  In ''N. crassa'', recessive mutations affecting the diploid stage of the life cycle are quite frequent in natural populations.<ref name=Leslie>{{cite journal |vauthors=Leslie JF, Raju NB |title=Recessive mutations from natural populations of Neurospora crassa that are expressed in the sexual diplophase |journal=Genetics |volume=111 |issue=4 |pages=759\u201377 |date=December 1985 |pmid=2933298 |pmc=1202670 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  These mutations, when homozygous in the diploid stage, often cause spores to have maturation defects or to produce barren fruiting bodies with few ascospores (sexual spores).  The majority of these homozygous mutations cause abnormal meiosis (e.g. disturbed chromosome pairing or disturbed pachytene or diplotene).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Raju NB, Leslie JF |title=Cytology of recessive sexual-phase mutants from wild strains of Neurospora crassa |journal=Genome |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=815\u201326 |date=October 1992 |pmid=1427061 |doi= 10.1139/g92-124|url=}}</ref>  The number of genes affecting the diploid stage was estimated to be at least 435<ref name=Leslie /> (about 4% of the total number of 9,730 genes).   Thus, outcrossing, promoted by the necessity for union of opposite mating types, likely provides the benefit of masking recessive mutations that would otherwise be deleterious to sexual spore formation (see [[Complementation (genetics)]]).\n\n==Current genetic research==\n''Neurospora crassa'' is not only a model organism for the study of phenotypic types in knock-out variants, but a particularly useful organism widely used in [[computational biology]] and the [[circadian clock]]. It has a natural reproductive cycle of 22 hours and is influenced by external factors such as light and temperature. Knock out variants of wild type ''N. crassa'' are widely studied to determine the influence of particular genes (''see [[Frequency (gene)]]'').\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n* [[Charles Yanofsky]]\n* [[David Perkins (geneticist)|David Perkins]]\n* [[Edward Tatum]]\n* [[Fluffy transcription factor]]\n* [[George Beadle]]\n* [[Norman Horowitz (geneticist)|Norman Horowitz]]\n* [[One gene, one enzyme]]\n* [[Robert Metzenberg]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation\n | last=Perkins | first=D | last2=Davis | first2=R\n | title=Evidence for Safety of Neurospora Species for Academic and Commercial Uses\n | periodical=Applied and Environmental Microbiology\n | volume=66 |issue=12|pages=5107\u20135109\n | date=December 2000\n | url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/66/12/5107.pdf | doi=10.1128/aem.66.12.5107-5109.2000 | pmid=11097875 | pmc=92429\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n | last=Osherov | first=N | last2=May | first2=GS\n | title=The molecular mechanisms of conidial germination\n | periodical=FEMS Microbiol Lett\n | volume=199|issue=2|pages=153\u201360\n | date=30 May 2001\n | pmid =11377860 | doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2001.tb10667.x}}\n* {{Citation\n | last=Froehlich | first=AC | last2=Noh | first2=B\n | last3=Vierstra | first3=RD, Loros J & Dunlap JC\n | title=Genetic and molecular analysis of Phytochromes from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa\n | periodical=Eukaryot Cell\n | volume=4\n | issue = 12\n | pages = 2140\u201352\n | date=December 2005\n |pmid= 16339731 | doi=10.1128/ec.4.12.2140-2152.2005 | pmc=1317490}}\n* {{Citation\n | last=Horowitz | first=NH\n | title=Fifty years ago: the Neurospora revolution\n | periodical=Genetics\n | date=April 1991\n | url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/127/4/631\n | pmid= 1827628\n | pmc=1204391\n | volume=127\n | issue=4\n | pages=631\u20135}}\n* {{Citation\n | last=Horowitz | first=NH | last2=Berg | first2=P\n | last3=Singer | first3=M, Lederberg J, Susman M, Doebley J & Crow JF.\n | title=A centennial: George W.

It is important in the elucidation of molecular events involved in [[circadian]] rhythms, [[epigenetics]] and [[gene silencing]], [[cell polarity]], [[cell fusion]], development, as well as many aspects of cell biology and biochemistry.\n\n==The sexual cycle==\n[[File:Neurospora crassa life cycle.jpg|thumb|600px|Neurospora crassa life cycle. The haploid mycelium reproduces asexually by two processes: (1) simple proliferation of existing mycelium, and (2) formation of conidia (macro- and micro-) which can be dispersed and then germinate to produce new mycelium.  In the sexual cycle, mating can only occur between individual strains of different mating type, A and a.  Fertilization occurs by the passage of nuclei of conidia or mycelium of one mating type into the protoperithecia of the opposite mating type through the trichogyne.  Fusion of the nuclei of opposite mating types occurs within the protoperithecium to form a zygote (2N) nucleus.]]\n\nSexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can only be formed when two mycelia of different mating type come together (see Figure).  Like other Ascomycetes, ''N. crassa'' has two mating types that, in this case, are symbolized by ''A'' and ''a''.  There is no evident morphological difference between the ''A'' and ''a'' mating type strains.  Both can form abundant protoperithecia, the female reproductive structure (see Figure).  Protoperithecia are formed most readily in the laboratory when growth occurs on solid (agar) synthetic medium with a relatively low source of nitrogen.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Westergaard M, Mitchell HK | year = 1947 | title = Neurospora.

A branched system of slender hyphae, called the trichogyne, extends from the tip of the ascogonium projecting beyond the sheathing hyphae into the air.  The sexual cycle is initiated (i.e. fertilization occurs) when a cell (usually a conidium) of opposite mating type contacts a part of the trichogyne (see Figure).  Such contact can be followed by cell fusion leading to one or more nuclei from the fertilizing cell migrating down the trichogyne into the ascogonium.  Since both ''A'' and ''a'' strains have the same sexual structures, neither strain can be regarded as exclusively male or female.  However, as a recipient, the protoperithecium of both the ''A'' and ''a'' strains can be thought of as the female structure, and the fertilizing conidium can be thought of as the male participant.\n\nThe subsequent steps following fusion of ''A'' and ''a'' haploid cells, have been outlined by Fincham and Day<ref>Fincham J RS, Day PR (1963). Fungal Genetics. Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, UK. ASIN: B000W851KO</ref> and Wagner and Mitchell.<ref>Wagner RP, Mitchell HK. (1964).  Genetics and Metabolism.  John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York ASIN: B00BXTC5BO</ref>  After fusion of the cells, the further fusion of their nuclei is delayed.  Instead, a nucleus from the fertilizing cell and a nucleus from the ascogonium become associated and begin to divide synchronously.  The products of these nuclear divisions (still in pairs of unlike mating type, i.e. ''A/a'') migrate into numerous ascogenous hyphae, which then begin to grow out of the ascogonium.  Each of these ascogenous hypha bends to form a hook (or crozier) at its tip and the ''A'' and ''a'' pair of haploid nuclei within the crozier divide synchronously.  Next, septa form to divide the crozier into three cells.  The central cell in the curve of the hook contains one ''A'' and one ''a'' nucleus (see Figure).  This binuclear cell initiates ascus formation and is called an \"ascus-initial\" cell.  Next the two [[uninucleate]] cells on either side of the first ascus-forming cell fuse with each other to form a [[binucleated cells|binucleate cell]] that can grow to form a further crozier that can then form its own ascus-initial cell. This process can then be repeated multiple times.\n\nAfter formation of the ascus-initial cell, the ''A'' and ''a'' nucleus fuse with each other to form a diploid nucleus (see Figure).  This nucleus is the only diploid nucleus in the entire life cycle of ''N. crassa''.  The diploid nucleus has 14 chromosomes formed from the two fused haploid nuclei that had 7 chromosomes each.  Formation of the diploid nucleus is immediately followed by [[meiosis]].  The two sequential divisions of meiosis lead to four haploid nuclei, two of the ''A'' mating type and two of the ''a'' mating type.  One further mitotic division leads to four ''A'' and four ''a'' nucleus in each ascus.  Meiosis is an essential part of the life cycle of all sexually reproducing organisms, and in its main features, meiosis in ''N. crassa'' seems typical of meiosis generally.\n\nAs the above events are occurring, the mycelial sheath that had enveloped the ascogonium develops as the wall of the perithecium, becomes impregnated with melanin, and blackens.  The mature perithecium has a flask-shaped structure.\n\nA mature perithecium may contain as many as 300 asci, each derived from identical fusion diploid nuclei. Ordinarily, in nature, when the perithecia mature the ascospores are ejected rather violently into the air.  These ascospores are heat resistant and, in the lab, require heating at 60&nbsp;\u00b0C for 30 minutes to induce germination.  For normal strains, the entire sexual cycle takes 10 to 15 days.  In a mature ascus containing eight ascospores, pairs of adjacent spores are identical in genetic constitution, since the last division is mitotic, and since the ascospores are contained in the ascus sac that holds them in a definite order determined by the direction of nuclear segregations during meiosis. Since the four primary products are also arranged in sequence, a first division segregation pattern of genetic markers can be distinguished from a second division segregation pattern.\n\n==Fine structure genetic analysis==\nBecause of the above features ''N. crassa'' was found to be very useful for the study of genetic events occurring in individual meioses. Mature asci from a perithecium can be separated on a microscope slide and the spores experimentally manipulated.  These studies usually involved the separate culture of individual ascospores resulting from a single meiotic event and determining the genotype of each spore.  Studies of this type, carried out in several different laboratories, established the phenomenon of \"gene conversion\" (e.g. see references<ref name=Mitchell>{{cite journal |author=Mitchell MB |title=ABERRANT RECOMBINATION OF PYRIDOXINE MUTANTS OF Neurospora |journal=Proc.

This gene is necessary for the synthesis of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), and mutants defective in this gene can be experimentally identified by their requirement for pantothenic acid in their growth medium. The two ''pan-2'' mutations B5 and B3 are located at different sites in the ''pan-2'' gene, so that a cross of B5 \u00b4 B3 yields wild-type recombinants at low frequency.<ref name=\"Case ME, Giles NH 1958 378\u201390\"/>  An analysis of 939 asci in which the genotypes of all meiotic products (ascospores) could be determined found 11 asci with an exceptional segregation pattern.  These included six asci in which there was one wild-type meiotic product but no expected reciprocal double-mutant (B5B3) product. Furthermore, in three asci the ratio of meiotic products was 1B5:3B3, rather than in the expected 2:2 ratio.  This study, as well as numerous additional studies in ''N. crassa'' and other fungi (reviewed by Whitehouse<ref>Whitehouse, HLK. (1982). Genetic Recombination. Wiley, New York {{ISBN|978-0471102052}}</ref>), led to an extensive characterization of gene conversion.  It became clear from this work that gene conversion events arise when a molecular recombination event happens to occur near the genetic markers under study (e.g. ''pan-2'' mutations in the above example).  Thus studies of gene conversion allowed insight into the details of the molecular mechanism of recombination.  Over the decades since the original observations of Mary Mitchell in 1955,<ref name=Mitchell /> a sequence of molecular models of recombination have been proposed based on both emerging genetic data from gene conversion studies and studies of the reaction capabilities of DNA.  Current understanding of the molecular mechanism of recombination is discussed in the Wikipedia articles [[Gene conversion]] and [[Genetic recombination]].  An understanding of recombination is relevant to several fundamental biologic problems, such the role of recombination and recombinational repair in cancer (see [[BRCA1]]) and the adaptive function of meiosis (see [[Meiosis]]).\n\n==Adaptive function of mating type==\nThat mating in ''N. crassa'' can only occur between strains of different mating type suggests that some degree of outcrossing is favored by natural selection.  In haploid multicellular fungi, such as ''N. crassa'', meiosis occurring in the brief diploid stage is one of their most complex processes.  The haploid multicellular vegetative stage, although physically much larger than the diploid stage, characteristically has a simple modular construction with little differentiation.  In ''N. crassa'', recessive mutations affecting the diploid stage of the life cycle are quite frequent in natural populations.<ref name=Leslie>{{cite journal |vauthors=Leslie JF, Raju NB |title=Recessive mutations from natural populations of Neurospora crassa that are expressed in the sexual diplophase |journal=Genetics |volume=111 |issue=4 |pages=759\u201377 |date=December 1985 |pmid=2933298 |pmc=1202670 |doi= |url=}}</ref>  These mutations, when homozygous in the diploid stage, often cause spores to have maturation defects or to produce barren fruiting bodies with few ascospores (sexual spores).  The majority of these homozygous mutations cause abnormal meiosis (e.g. disturbed chromosome pairing or disturbed pachytene or diplotene).<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Raju NB, Leslie JF |title=Cytology of recessive sexual-phase mutants from wild strains of Neurospora crassa |journal=Genome |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=815\u201326 |date=October 1992 |pmid=1427061 |doi= 10.1139/g92-124|url=}}</ref>  The number of genes affecting the diploid stage was estimated to be at least 435<ref name=Leslie /> (about 4% of the total number of 9,730 genes).   Thus, outcrossing, promoted by the necessity for union of opposite mating types, likely provides the benefit of masking recessive mutations that would otherwise be deleterious to sexual spore formation (see [[Complementation (genetics)]]).\n\n==Current genetic research==\n''Neurospora crassa'' is not only a model organism for the study of phenotypic types in knock-out variants, but a particularly useful organism widely used in [[computational biology]] and the [[circadian clock]]. It has a natural reproductive cycle of 22 hours and is influenced by external factors such as light and temperature. Knock out variants of wild type ''N. crassa'' are widely studied to determine the influence of particular genes (''see [[Frequency (gene)]]'').\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Fungi}}\n* [[Charles Yanofsky]]\n* [[David Perkins (geneticist)|David Perkins]]\n* [[Edward Tatum]]\n* [[Fluffy transcription factor]]\n* [[George Beadle]]\n* [[Norman Horowitz (geneticist)|Norman Horowitz]]\n* [[One gene, one enzyme]]\n* [[Robert Metzenberg]]\n\n== Notes and references ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Citation\n | last=Perkins | first=D | last2=Davis | first2=R\n | title=Evidence for Safety of Neurospora Species for Academic and Commercial Uses\n | periodical=Applied and Environmental Microbiology\n | volume=66 |issue=12|pages=5107\u20135109\n | date=December 2000\n | url=http://aem.asm.org/cgi/reprint/66/12/5107.pdf | doi=10.1128/aem.66.12.5107-5109.2000 | pmid=11097875 | pmc=92429\n}}. {{PMID|11097875}}\n* {{Citation\n | last=Osherov | first=N | last2=May | first2=GS\n | title=The molecular mechanisms of conidial germination\n | periodical=FEMS Microbiol Lett\n | volume=199|issue=2|pages=153\u201360\n | date=30 May 2001\n | pmid =11377860 | doi=10.1111/j.1574-6968.2001.tb10667.x}}\n* {{Citation\n | last=Froehlich | first=AC | last2=Noh | first2=B\n | last3=Vierstra | first3=RD, Loros J & Dunlap JC\n | title=Genetic and molecular analysis of Phytochromes from the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa\n | periodical=Eukaryot Cell\n | volume=4\n | issue = 12\n | pages = 2140\u201352\n | date=December 2005\n |pmid= 16339731 | doi=10.1128/ec.4.12.2140-2152.2005 | pmc=1317490}}\n* {{Citation\n | last=Horowitz | first=NH\n | title=Fifty years ago: the Neurospora revolution\n | periodical=Genetics\n | date=April 1991\n | url=http://www.genetics.org/cgi/reprint/127/4/631\n | pmid= 1827628\n | pmc=1204391\n | volume=127\n | issue=4\n | pages=631\u20135}}\n* {{Citation\n | last=Horowitz | first=NH | last2=Berg | first2=P\n | last3=Singer | first3=M, Lederberg J, Susman M, Doebley J & Crow JF.\n | title=A centennial: George W.

In the earlier history of Russia it was known as one of the holy places of the Russian Orthodox Church, because of its monastery, that gave Russia one of its greatest saints, [[Saint Seraphim of Sarov|St.&nbsp;Seraphim]]. Since the 1940s, it has gradually become the center for research and production of Soviet and later Russian nuclear weapons.\n\nThe history of human settlement in the area around Sarov goes back at least to the 12th\u201313th centuries, when a large [[Mordvins|Mordvin]] settlement was founded on its spot. In 1298, the town was taken over by [[Tatars]].\n\nThe modern town took its name from being the site of the [[Sarov Monastery]] next to the [[Sarov River]]. In 1664, an Orthodox monk Theodosius first settled on the Sarov hill. The first Church of Sarov tenement was founded in 1706. Saint Seraphim was living in Sarov from 1778 to 1833. In 1903, the monastery was visited by [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas&nbsp;II]] and other members of the royal family. At that time the monastery had nine churches, including one underground. Around 320&nbsp;monks lived in the monastery.\n\nIn 1923 the monastery was closed, the monks faced Bolshevik repressions, and many were executed. During World War&nbsp;II, the monastery buildings were used as factories for producing rockets for [[Katyusha rocket launcher|BM-13 \"Katyusha\"]] rocket launchers.\n\nIn 1946, the [[All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics]]\u2014a [[nuclear weapon]]s design facility that would become known in the West under the [[acronym]] ''VNIIEF''\u2014was built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Military Outposts: Sarov, Russia's Los Alamos|url=http://www.thelivingmoon.com/45jack_files/03files/Russian_Bases_Sarov_Russias_Los_Alamos_01.html|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref> Sarov became a [[closed city]].

In the earlier history of Russia it was known as one of the holy places of the Russian Orthodox Church, because of its monastery, that gave Russia one of its greatest saints, [[Saint Seraphim of Sarov|St.&nbsp;Seraphim]]. Since the 1940s, it has gradually become the center for research and production of Soviet and later Russian nuclear weapons.\n\nThe history of human settlement in the area around Sarov goes back at least to the 12th\u201313th centuries, when a large [[Mordvins|Mordvin]] settlement was founded on its spot. In 1298, the town was taken over by [[Tatars]].\n\nThe modern town took its name from being the site of the [[Sarov Monastery]] next to the [[Sarov River]]. In 1664, an Orthodox monk Theodosius first settled on the Sarov hill. The first Church of Sarov tenement was founded in 1706. Saint Seraphim was living in Sarov from 1778 to 1833. In 1903, the monastery was visited by [[Tsar]] [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas&nbsp;II]] and other members of the royal family. At that time the monastery had nine churches, including one underground. Around 320&nbsp;monks lived in the monastery.\n\nIn 1923 the monastery was closed, the monks faced Bolshevik repressions, and many were executed. During World War&nbsp;II, the monastery buildings were used as factories for producing rockets for [[Katyusha rocket launcher|BM-13 \"Katyusha\"]] rocket launchers.\n\nIn 1946, the [[All-Union Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics]]\u2014a [[nuclear weapon]]s design facility that would become known in the West under the [[acronym]] ''VNIIEF''\u2014was built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Military Outposts: Sarov, Russia's Los Alamos|url=http://www.thelivingmoon.com/45jack_files/03files/Russian_Bases_Sarov_Russias_Los_Alamos_01.html|accessdate=9 July 2013}}</ref> Sarov became a [[closed city]].

The bases of the plants begin to turn yellow. If the plants are still green, the seed will not be useful, and the fiber will be underdeveloped. The fiber degrades once the plants turn brown.\n\nFlax grown for seed is allowed to mature until the seed capsules are yellow and just starting to split; it is then harvested in various ways. A [[combine harvester]] may either cut only the heads of the plants, or the whole plant. These are then dried to extract the seed. The amount of weeds in the straw affects its marketability, and this, coupled with market prices, determines whether the farmer chooses to harvest the flax straw. If the flax straw is not harvested, typically, it is burned, since the stalks are quite tough and decompose slowly (''i.e.'', not in a single season). Formed into [[windrow]]s from the harvesting process, the straw often clogs up tillage and planting equipment. Flax straw that is not of sufficient quality for fiber uses can be baled to build shelters for farm animals, or sold as biofuel, or removed from the field in the spring.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.producer.com/2008/03/the-last-straw-nine-ways-to-handle-flax-straw/ |title=The last straw: nine ways to handle flax straw |author=Michael Raine |date=27 March 2008 |journal=The Western Producer |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092042/http://www.producer.com/2008/03/the-last-straw-nine-ways-to-handle-flax-straw/ |archivedate=18 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\nTwo ways are used to harvest flax fiber, one involving mechanized equipment (combines), and a second method, more manual and targeting maximum fiber length.\n\n===Harvesting for fiber===\n\n====Mechanical====\nFlax for fiber production is usually harvested by a specialized flax harvester. Usually built on the same machine base as a combine, but instead of the cutting head it has a flax puller. The flax plant turned over and is gripped by rubber belts roughly 20\u201325&nbsp;cm (8-10\") above ground, to avoid getting grasses and weeds in the flax. The rubber belts then pull the whole plant out of the ground with the roots so the whole length of the plant fiber can be used. The plants then pass over the machine and is placed on the field crosswise to the harvesters direction of travel. The plants are left in the field for field retting.\n\nThe mature plant can also be cut with mowing equipment, similar to hay harvesting, and raked into windrows. When dried sufficiently, a combine then harvests the seeds similar to wheat or oat harvesting .\n\n====Manual====\nThe plant is pulled up with the roots (not cut), so as to increase the fiber length. After this, the flax is allowed to dry, the seeds are removed, and it is then [[Retting|retted]]. Dependent upon climatic conditions, characteristics of the sown flax and fields, the flax remains on the ground between two weeks and two months for retting. As a result of alternating rain and the sun, an enzymatic action degrades the pectins which bind fibers to the straw. The farmers turn over the straw during retting to evenly rett the stalks. When the straw is retted and sufficiently dry, it is rolled up. It is then stored by farmers before extracting the fibers.\n[[File:Emile Claus001.jpg|thumb|''De vlasoogst'' (1904) (\"''The flax harvest''\") painting by [[Emile Claus]], [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]]]\n\n==Processing==\n[[File:Drhlen.jpg|thumb|A hackle or heckle, a tool for threshing flax and preparing the fiber]]\n[[File:58-aspetti di vita quotidiana,abbigliamento lino,Taccuino Sa.jpg|thumb|Flax tissues, [[Tacuinum sanitatis]], 14th century]]\n[[Threshing]] is the process of removing the seeds from the rest of the plant. Separating the usable flax fibers from other components requires pulling the stems through a hackle and/or beating the plants to break them.\n\nFlax processing is divided into two parts: the first part is generally done by the farmer, to bring the flax fiber into a fit state for general or common purposes. This can be performed by three machines: one for threshing out the seed, one for breaking and separating the straw (stem) from the fiber, and one for further separating the broken straw and matter from the fiber.\n\nThe second part of the process brings the flax into a state for the very finest purposes, such as [[lace]], [[cambric]], [[damask]], and very fine [[linen]]. This second part is performed by a refining machine.\n\n<!-- how-to, not encyclopedic * Take the flax in small handsful in the left hand, spread it flat between the third and little finger, with the seed end downward, and the root-end above, as near the hand as possible.\n* Put the handful between the beaters of the breaking machine, and beat it gently till the three or four inches, which have been under the operation of the machine, appear to be soft.\n* Remove the flax a little higher in the hand, so as to let the soft part of the flax rest upon the little finger, and continue to beat it till all is soft, and the wood is separated from the fiber, keeping the left hand close to the block and the flax as flat upon the block as possible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n* The other end of the flax is then to be turned, and the end which has been beaten is to be wrapped round the little finger, the root end flat, and beaten in the machine till the wood is separated, exactly in the same way as the other end was beaten. -->\n\n==Preparation for spinning==\n[[File:Labeledstemforposter copy.jpg|thumb|Stem cross-section, showing locations of underlying tissues: Ep = [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]; C = [[cortex (botany)|cortex]]; BF = [[bast (biology)|bast]] fibers; P = [[phloem]]; X = [[xylem]]; Pi = [[pith]]]]\n[[File:Rhof-flachsbearbeitung.ogv|thumb|Threshing, retting, and dressing flax at the [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]] (Germany)]]\nBefore the flax fibers can be spun into linen, they must be separated from the rest of the stalk. The first step in this process is [[retting]], which is the process of rotting away the inner stalk, leaving the outer parts intact. At this point, straw, or coarse outer stem ([[cortex (botany)|cortex]] and [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]), is still remaining. To remove this, the flax is \"broken\", the straw is broken up into small, short bits, while the actual fiber is left unharmed. [[Scutching]] scrapes the outer straw from the fiber. The stems are then pulled through \"hackles\", which act like combs to remove the straw and some shorter fibers out of the long fiber.\n\n===Retting flax===\nSeveral methods are used for [[retting]] flax. It can be retted in a pond, stream, field, or tank. When the retting is complete, the bundles of flax feel soft and slimy, and quite a few fibers are standing out from the stalks. When wrapped around a finger, the inner woody part springs away from the fibers. Pond retting is the fastest. It consists of placing the flax in a pool of water which will not evaporate. It generally takes place in a shallow pool which will warm up dramatically in the sun; the process may take from a few days to a few weeks. Pond-retted flax is traditionally considered of lower quality, possibly because the product can become dirty, and is easily over-retted, damaging the fiber. This form of retting also produces quite an odor. Stream retting is similar to pool retting, but the flax is submerged in bundles in a stream or river. This generally takes two or three weeks longer than pond retting, but the end product is less likely to be dirty, does not smell as bad, and because the water is cooler, is less likely to be over-retted. Both pond and stream retting were traditionally used less because they pollute the waters used for the process.\n\nIn field retting, the flax is laid out in a large field, and dew is allowed to collect on it. This process normally takes a month or more, but is generally considered to provide the highest quality flax fibers,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and it produces the least pollution.\n\nRetting can also be done in a plastic trash can or any type of water-tight container of wood, concrete, earthenware, or plastic. Metal containers will not work, as an acid is produced when retting, and it would [[corrode]] the metal. If the water temperature is kept at {{convert|80|F|C}}, the retting process under these conditions takes 4 or 5 days. If the water is any colder, it takes longer. Scum collects at the top, and an odor is given off the same as in pond retting. 'Enzymatic' retting of flax has been researched as a technique to engineer fibers with specific properties.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Akin Dodd | first1 = Foulk | year = 2008 | title = Pectinolytic enzymes and retting | url = | journal = BioResources | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 155\u2013169 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Akin Dodd | first1 = Foulk | year = 2001 | title = Processing techniques for improving enzyme-retting of flax | url = | journal = Industrial Crops and Products | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 239\u2013248 | doi=10.1016/s0926-6690(00)00081-9}}</ref>\n\n===Dressing the flax===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Harfleur - Compagnons duellistes - teillage du lin.jpg|Breaking flax\nFile:Harfleur - Compagnons duellistes - battage du lin.jpg|Scutching flax\nFile:Harfleur - Compagnons duellistes - peignage du lin.jpg|Heckling flax\nFile:Flax fibers.JPG|Flax fiber in different forms, before and after processing \n</gallery>\nDressing the flax is the process of removing the straw from the fibers. Dressing consists of three steps: breaking, scutching, and heckling. The breaking breaks up the straw. Some of the straw is scraped from the fibers in the scutching process, and finally, the fiber is pulled through heckles to remove the last bits of straw.\n\n:Breaking breaks up the straw into short segments. <!-- more how-to To do it, take the bundles of flax and untie them. Next, in small handsful, put it between the beater of the breaking machine (a set of wooden blades that mesh together when the upper jaw is lowered, which look like a paper cutter but instead of having a big knife it has a blunt arm), and beat it till the three or four inches that have been beaten appear to be soft. Move the flax a little higher and continue to beat it till all is soft, and the wood is separated from the fiber. When half of the flax is broken, hold the beaten end and beat the rest in the same way as the other end was beaten, till the wood is separated. -->\n\n:[[Scutching]] removes some of the [[straw]] from the fiber<!-- , it helps to swing a wooden scutching knife down the fibers while they hang vertically, thus scraping the edge of the knife along the fibers and pull away pieces of the stalk. Some of the fiber will also be scutched away, this cannot be helped and is a normal part of the process -->.\n\n:[[Heckling (flax)|Heckling]] is pulling the fiber through various sizes of [[heckling comb]]s or heckles. A heckle is a bed of \"nails\"\u2014sharp, long-tapered, tempered, polished steel pins driven into wooden blocks at regular spacing. <!-- A good progression is from four pins per square inch, to 12, to 25 to 48 to 80. The first three will remove the straw, and the last two will split and polish the fibers. Some of the finer stuff that comes off in the last hackles is called [[tow]] and can be [[carding|carded]] like wool and [[spinning (textiles)|spun]]. It will produce a coarser yarn than the fibers pulled through the heckles because it will still have some straw in it. -->\n\n==Genetically modified flax contamination==\n[[File:Flax Plants.jpg|thumb|Small flax plants]]\nIn September 2009, Canadian flax exports reportedly had been contaminated by a deregistered [[genetically modified]] cultivar called 'Triffid' that had food and feed safety approval in Canada and the U.S.,<ref name=\"twp\"/><ref name=\"cdc\"/> however, Canadian growers and the Flax Council of Canada raised concerns about the marketability of this cultivar in Europe where a [[zero tolerance]] policy exists regarding unapproved [[genetically modified organism]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/08/flax-canada-gmo-idUSN0824305620100108|title=Canada moves to revive flax exports after GMO flap|work=Reuters|date=2010-01-08|accessdate=2012-11-11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509120442/http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/08/flax-canada-gmo-idUSN0824305620100108|archivedate=2013-05-09}}</ref> Subsequently, deregistered in 2010 and never grown commercially in Canada or the U.S.,<ref name=\"cbc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/triffid-seed-threatens-flax-industry-1.898128|title=Triffid seed threatens flax industry|publisher=CBC News|date=20 January 2010|accessdate=11 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201042722/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/triffid-seed-threatens-flax-industry-1.898128|archivedate=1 February 2016}}</ref> 'Triffid' stores were destroyed, but future exports and further tests at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] proved that 'Triffid' persisted among flax crops, possibly affecting future crops.<ref name=cbc/> Canadian flaxseed cultivars were reconstituted with 'Triffid'-free seed used to plant the 2014 crop.<ref name=\"twp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.producer.com/2013/01/flax-growers-try-to-flush-triffid-from-system%E2%80%A9/|title=Flax growers try to flush Triffid from system|publisher=The Western Producer|date=11 January 2013|accessdate=11 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217015854/http://www.producer.com/2013/01/flax-growers-try-to-flush-triffid-from-system%E2%80%A9/|archivedate=17 February 2016}}</ref> Laboratories are certified to test for the presence of 'Triffid' at a level of one seed in 10,000.<ref name=\"cdc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grainscanada.gc.ca/gmflax-lingm/stpf-peevl-en.pdf|title=Sampling and Testing Protocol for Canadian Flaxseed Exported to the European Union|publisher=Canadian Grain Commission|date=28 April 2014|accessdate=11 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151014045315/http://www.grainscanada.gc.ca/gmflax-lingm/stpf-peevl-en.pdf|archivedate=14 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Symbolic images==\nFlax is the emblem of [[Northern Ireland]] and displayed by the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].

The bases of the plants begin to turn yellow. If the plants are still green, the seed will not be useful, and the fiber will be underdeveloped. The fiber degrades once the plants turn brown.\n\nFlax grown for seed is allowed to mature until the seed capsules are yellow and just starting to split; it is then harvested in various ways. A [[combine harvester]] may either cut only the heads of the plants, or the whole plant. These are then dried to extract the seed. The amount of weeds in the straw affects its marketability, and this, coupled with market prices, determines whether the farmer chooses to harvest the flax straw. If the flax straw is not harvested, typically, it is burned, since the stalks are quite tough and decompose slowly (''i.e.'', not in a single season). Formed into [[windrow]]s from the harvesting process, the straw often clogs up tillage and planting equipment. Flax straw that is not of sufficient quality for fiber uses can be baled to build shelters for farm animals, or sold as biofuel, or removed from the field in the spring.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.producer.com/2008/03/the-last-straw-nine-ways-to-handle-flax-straw/ |title=The last straw: nine ways to handle flax straw |author=Michael Raine |date=27 March 2008 |journal=The Western Producer |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092042/http://www.producer.com/2008/03/the-last-straw-nine-ways-to-handle-flax-straw/ |archivedate=18 May 2015 }}</ref>\n\nTwo ways are used to harvest flax fiber, one involving mechanized equipment (combines), and a second method, more manual and targeting maximum fiber length.\n\n===Harvesting for fiber===\n\n====Mechanical====\nFlax for fiber production is usually harvested by a specialized flax harvester. Usually built on the same machine base as a combine, but instead of the cutting head it has a flax puller. The flax plant turned over and is gripped by rubber belts roughly 20\u201325&nbsp;cm (8-10\") above ground, to avoid getting grasses and weeds in the flax. The rubber belts then pull the whole plant out of the ground with the roots so the whole length of the plant fiber can be used. The plants then pass over the machine and is placed on the field crosswise to the harvesters direction of travel. The plants are left in the field for field retting.\n\nThe mature plant can also be cut with mowing equipment, similar to hay harvesting, and raked into windrows. When dried sufficiently, a combine then harvests the seeds similar to wheat or oat harvesting .\n\n====Manual====\nThe plant is pulled up with the roots (not cut), so as to increase the fiber length. After this, the flax is allowed to dry, the seeds are removed, and it is then [[Retting|retted]]. Dependent upon climatic conditions, characteristics of the sown flax and fields, the flax remains on the ground between two weeks and two months for retting. As a result of alternating rain and the sun, an enzymatic action degrades the pectins which bind fibers to the straw. The farmers turn over the straw during retting to evenly rett the stalks. When the straw is retted and sufficiently dry, it is rolled up. It is then stored by farmers before extracting the fibers.\n[[File:Emile Claus001.jpg|thumb|''De vlasoogst'' (1904) (\"''The flax harvest''\") painting by [[Emile Claus]], [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]], [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]]]\n\n==Processing==\n[[File:Drhlen.jpg|thumb|A hackle or heckle, a tool for threshing flax and preparing the fiber]]\n[[File:58-aspetti di vita quotidiana,abbigliamento lino,Taccuino Sa.jpg|thumb|Flax tissues, [[Tacuinum sanitatis]], 14th century]]\n[[Threshing]] is the process of removing the seeds from the rest of the plant. Separating the usable flax fibers from other components requires pulling the stems through a hackle and/or beating the plants to break them.\n\nFlax processing is divided into two parts: the first part is generally done by the farmer, to bring the flax fiber into a fit state for general or common purposes. This can be performed by three machines: one for threshing out the seed, one for breaking and separating the straw (stem) from the fiber, and one for further separating the broken straw and matter from the fiber.\n\nThe second part of the process brings the flax into a state for the very finest purposes, such as [[lace]], [[cambric]], [[damask]], and very fine [[linen]]. This second part is performed by a refining machine.\n\n<!-- how-to, not encyclopedic * Take the flax in small handsful in the left hand, spread it flat between the third and little finger, with the seed end downward, and the root-end above, as near the hand as possible.\n* Put the handful between the beaters of the breaking machine, and beat it gently till the three or four inches, which have been under the operation of the machine, appear to be soft.\n* Remove the flax a little higher in the hand, so as to let the soft part of the flax rest upon the little finger, and continue to beat it till all is soft, and the wood is separated from the fiber, keeping the left hand close to the block and the flax as flat upon the block as possible.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}\n* The other end of the flax is then to be turned, and the end which has been beaten is to be wrapped round the little finger, the root end flat, and beaten in the machine till the wood is separated, exactly in the same way as the other end was beaten. -->\n\n==Preparation for spinning==\n[[File:Labeledstemforposter copy.jpg|thumb|Stem cross-section, showing locations of underlying tissues: Ep = [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]; C = [[cortex (botany)|cortex]]; BF = [[bast (biology)|bast]] fibers; P = [[phloem]]; X = [[xylem]]; Pi = [[pith]]]]\n[[File:Rhof-flachsbearbeitung.ogv|thumb|Threshing, retting, and dressing flax at the [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]] (Germany)]]\nBefore the flax fibers can be spun into linen, they must be separated from the rest of the stalk. The first step in this process is [[retting]], which is the process of rotting away the inner stalk, leaving the outer parts intact. At this point, straw, or coarse outer stem ([[cortex (botany)|cortex]] and [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]]), is still remaining. To remove this, the flax is \"broken\", the straw is broken up into small, short bits, while the actual fiber is left unharmed. [[Scutching]] scrapes the outer straw from the fiber. The stems are then pulled through \"hackles\", which act like combs to remove the straw and some shorter fibers out of the long fiber.\n\n===Retting flax===\nSeveral methods are used for [[retting]] flax. It can be retted in a pond, stream, field, or tank. When the retting is complete, the bundles of flax feel soft and slimy, and quite a few fibers are standing out from the stalks. When wrapped around a finger, the inner woody part springs away from the fibers. Pond retting is the fastest. It consists of placing the flax in a pool of water which will not evaporate. It generally takes place in a shallow pool which will warm up dramatically in the sun; the process may take from a few days to a few weeks. Pond-retted flax is traditionally considered of lower quality, possibly because the product can become dirty, and is easily over-retted, damaging the fiber. This form of retting also produces quite an odor. Stream retting is similar to pool retting, but the flax is submerged in bundles in a stream or river. This generally takes two or three weeks longer than pond retting, but the end product is less likely to be dirty, does not smell as bad, and because the water is cooler, is less likely to be over-retted. Both pond and stream retting were traditionally used less because they pollute the waters used for the process.\n\nIn field retting, the flax is laid out in a large field, and dew is allowed to collect on it. This process normally takes a month or more, but is generally considered to provide the highest quality flax fibers,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and it produces the least pollution.\n\nRetting can also be done in a plastic trash can or any type of water-tight container of wood, concrete, earthenware, or plastic. Metal containers will not work, as an acid is produced when retting, and it would [[corrode]] the metal. If the water temperature is kept at {{convert|80|F|C}}, the retting process under these conditions takes 4 or 5 days. If the water is any colder, it takes longer. Scum collects at the top, and an odor is given off the same as in pond retting. 'Enzymatic' retting of flax has been researched as a technique to engineer fibers with specific properties.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Akin Dodd | first1 = Foulk | year = 2008 | title = Pectinolytic enzymes and retting | url = | journal = BioResources | volume = 3 | issue = 1| pages = 155\u2013169 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Akin Dodd | first1 = Foulk | year = 2001 | title = Processing techniques for improving enzyme-retting of flax | url = | journal = Industrial Crops and Products | volume = 13 | issue = 3| pages = 239\u2013248 | doi=10.1016/s0926-6690(00)00081-9}}</ref>\n\n===Dressing the flax===\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Harfleur - Compagnons duellistes - teillage du lin.jpg|Breaking flax\nFile:Harfleur - Compagnons duellistes - battage du lin.jpg|Scutching flax\nFile:Harfleur - Compagnons duellistes - peignage du lin.jpg|Heckling flax\nFile:Flax fibers.JPG|Flax fiber in different forms, before and after processing \n</gallery>\nDressing the flax is the process of removing the straw from the fibers. Dressing consists of three steps: breaking, scutching, and heckling. The breaking breaks up the straw. Some of the straw is scraped from the fibers in the scutching process, and finally, the fiber is pulled through heckles to remove the last bits of straw.\n\n:Breaking breaks up the straw into short segments. <!-- more how-to To do it, take the bundles of flax and untie them. Next, in small handsful, put it between the beater of the breaking machine (a set of wooden blades that mesh together when the upper jaw is lowered, which look like a paper cutter but instead of having a big knife it has a blunt arm), and beat it till the three or four inches that have been beaten appear to be soft. Move the flax a little higher and continue to beat it till all is soft, and the wood is separated from the fiber. When half of the flax is broken, hold the beaten end and beat the rest in the same way as the other end was beaten, till the wood is separated. -->\n\n:[[Scutching]] removes some of the [[straw]] from the fiber<!-- , it helps to swing a wooden scutching knife down the fibers while they hang vertically, thus scraping the edge of the knife along the fibers and pull away pieces of the stalk. Some of the fiber will also be scutched away, this cannot be helped and is a normal part of the process -->.\n\n:[[Heckling (flax)|Heckling]] is pulling the fiber through various sizes of [[heckling comb]]s or heckles. A heckle is a bed of \"nails\"\u2014sharp, long-tapered, tempered, polished steel pins driven into wooden blocks at regular spacing. <!-- A good progression is from four pins per square inch, to 12, to 25 to 48 to 80. The first three will remove the straw, and the last two will split and polish the fibers. Some of the finer stuff that comes off in the last hackles is called [[tow]] and can be [[carding|carded]] like wool and [[spinning (textiles)|spun]]. It will produce a coarser yarn than the fibers pulled through the heckles because it will still have some straw in it. -->\n\n==Genetically modified flax contamination==\n[[File:Flax Plants.jpg|thumb|Small flax plants]]\nIn September 2009, Canadian flax exports reportedly had been contaminated by a deregistered [[genetically modified]] cultivar called 'Triffid' that had food and feed safety approval in Canada and the U.S.,<ref name=\"twp\"/><ref name=\"cdc\"/> however, Canadian growers and the Flax Council of Canada raised concerns about the marketability of this cultivar in Europe where a [[zero tolerance]] policy exists regarding unapproved [[genetically modified organism]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/08/flax-canada-gmo-idUSN0824305620100108|title=Canada moves to revive flax exports after GMO flap|work=Reuters|date=2010-01-08|accessdate=2012-11-11|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509120442/http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/01/08/flax-canada-gmo-idUSN0824305620100108|archivedate=2013-05-09}}</ref> Subsequently, deregistered in 2010 and never grown commercially in Canada or the U.S.,<ref name=\"cbc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/triffid-seed-threatens-flax-industry-1.898128|title=Triffid seed threatens flax industry|publisher=CBC News|date=20 January 2010|accessdate=11 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201042722/http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/triffid-seed-threatens-flax-industry-1.898128|archivedate=1 February 2016}}</ref> 'Triffid' stores were destroyed, but future exports and further tests at the [[University of Saskatchewan]] proved that 'Triffid' persisted among flax crops, possibly affecting future crops.<ref name=cbc/> Canadian flaxseed cultivars were reconstituted with 'Triffid'-free seed used to plant the 2014 crop.<ref name=\"twp\">{{cite web|url=http://www.producer.com/2013/01/flax-growers-try-to-flush-triffid-from-system%E2%80%A9/|title=Flax growers try to flush Triffid from system|publisher=The Western Producer|date=11 January 2013|accessdate=11 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217015854/http://www.producer.com/2013/01/flax-growers-try-to-flush-triffid-from-system%E2%80%A9/|archivedate=17 February 2016}}</ref> Laboratories are certified to test for the presence of 'Triffid' at a level of one seed in 10,000.<ref name=\"cdc\">{{cite web|url=http://www.grainscanada.gc.ca/gmflax-lingm/stpf-peevl-en.pdf|title=Sampling and Testing Protocol for Canadian Flaxseed Exported to the European Union|publisher=Canadian Grain Commission|date=28 April 2014|accessdate=11 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151014045315/http://www.grainscanada.gc.ca/gmflax-lingm/stpf-peevl-en.pdf|archivedate=14 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Symbolic images==\nFlax is the emblem of [[Northern Ireland]] and displayed by the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].
