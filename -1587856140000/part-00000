The combined population of Central America is estimated at 44.53 million (2016).<ref>{{cite web|website=World Population Review|title=Central America Population 2020|language=en|url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/continents/central-america-population/|accessdate=February 9, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCentral America is a part of the [[Mesoamerica]]n [[biodiversity hotspot]], which extends from northern Guatemala to central Panama. Due to the presence of several [[active fault|active geologic faults]] and the [[Central America Volcanic Arc]], there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region, such as [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]] and earthquakes, which has resulted in death, injury and property damage.\n\nIn the [[Pre-Columbian era]], Central America was inhabited by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area|Isthmo-Colombian]] peoples to the south and east. Following the Spanish expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages to the [[Americas]], Spain began to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonize the Americas]]. From 1609 to 1821, the majority of Central American territories (except for what would become Belize and Panama, and including the modern Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) were governed by the viceroyalty of [[New Spain]] from [[Mexico City]] as the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. On 24 August 1821, Spanish Viceroy [[Juan O'Donoj\u00fa|Juan de O'Donoj\u00fa]] signed the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]], which established New Spain's independence from Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/spain-accepts-mexican-independence|title=Spain accepts Mexican independence|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> On 15 September 1821, the [[Act of Independence of Central America]] was enacted to announce Central America's separation from the [[Spanish Empire]] and provide for the establishment of a new [[Federal Republic of Central America|Central American state]]. Some of New Spain's provinces in the Central American region (i.e. what would become [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]]) were annexed to the [[First Mexican Empire]]; however, in 1823 they seceded from Mexico to form the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] until 1838.\n\nIn 1838, [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Guatemala]] became the first of Central America's seven states to become independent autonomous countries, followed by [[El Salvador]] in 1841, [[Panama]] in 1903 and [[Belize]] in 1981{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}. Despite the dissolution of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], there is anecdotal evidence that demonstrates that [[Salvadorans]], [[Panamanians]], [[Costa Ricans]], [[Guatemalans]], [[Hondurans]] and [[Nicaraguans]] continue to maintain a Central American identity. For instance, Central Americans sometimes refer to their nations as if they were provinces of a Central American state. It is not unusual to write \"C.A.\" after the country's name in formal and informal contexts. Governments in the region sometimes reinforce this sense of belonging to Central America in its citizens. For example, automobile licence plates in many of the region's countries include the moniker, ''Centroamerica,'' alongside the country's name. [[Belizeans]] are mostly associated to be culturally [[West Indian]] rather than Central American.\n\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=3 widths=70 heights=70 mode=nolines caption=\"Central American flags\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Nuvola Salvadoran flag.svg|[[El Salvador]]\nFile:Nuvola Guatemalan flag.svg|[[Guatemala]]\nFile:Nuvola Honduran flag.svg|[[Honduras]]\nFile:Nuvola Nicaraguan flag.svg|[[Nicaragua]]\nFile:Nuvola Costa Rican state flag.svg|[[Costa Rica]]\nFile:Nuvola Panaman flag.svg|[[Panama]]\nFile:Nuvola Belizean flag.svg|[[Belize]]\n</gallery>\n}}\n\n== Different definitions ==\n[[File:Flag-map of Central America.svg|thumb|[[Guatemala]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Panama]] and [[Belize]] are historically the seven nations in Central America politically, geographically and culturally.]]\n\n\"Central America\" may mean different things to various people, based upon different contexts:\n* The [[United Nations geoscheme for the Americas]] defines the region as all states of mainland North America south of the United States and specifically includes all of Mexico.<ref name=UN2017 />\n* [[Middle America (Americas)|Middle America]] is usually thought to comprise [[Mexico]] to the north of the 7 states of ''Central America'' as well as [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]] to the south.

While both can be translated into English as \"Central America\", \"Am\u00e9rica Central\" is generally used to refer to the geographical area of the seven countries between [[Mexico]] and [[Colombia]], while \"Centroam\u00e9rica\" is used when referring to the former members of the Federation emphasizing the shared culture and history of the region.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} \n* In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] as a rule and occasionally in Spanish and other languages, the entirety of the [[Antilles]] is often included in the definition of Central America.

Most notable among these were the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]], who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the [[Aztec]]s, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern [[El Salvador]], eastern [[Honduras]], Caribbean [[Nicaragua]], most of [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]] were predominantly speakers of the [[Chibchan languages]] at the time of European contact and are considered by some<ref name=\"Hoopes&Fonseca2003\" /> culturally different and grouped in the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area]].\n\nFollowing the Spanish expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of [[Maya civilization|Maya territory]] in 1523. Soon after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Pedro de Alvarado]] commenced the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquest of northern Central America]] for the [[Spanish Empire]]. Beginning with his arrival in [[Soconusco]] in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche']], [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujil]], [[Pipil people|Pipil]], and the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]]. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin]] remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms \u2013 the [[Kowoj]] and the [[Itza people]] \u2013 were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the [[Spanish conquest of Pet\u00e9n]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 1538, Spain established the [[Real Audiencia of Panama#First installation|Real Audiencia of Panama]], which had jurisdiction over all land from the [[Strait of Magellan]] to the [[Gulf of Fonseca]]. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the ''[[Real Audiencia of Guatemala|Audiencia Real de Guatemala]]''. This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in [[Antigua Guatemala]], was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a [[Captaincies of the Spanish Empire|captaincy general]] and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of [[British Honduras|present-day Belize]] and Panama.\n\nThe Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a [[1811 Independence Movement|rebellion in 1811]] which began in the [[Intendant#Spain and the Spanish Empire|intendancy]] of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the [[Act of Independence of Central America]]. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] and the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire]], and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.\n\n[[File:Salcoatit\u00e1n, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|250px|The five rowed volcanos in the coat of arms of Central America was inspired by the [[Cordillera de Apaneca]] volcanic range of [[El Salvador]], visible from the city of [[Sonsonate]], which became the capital of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] in 1834.]]\n\nFrom its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived [[First Mexican Empire]]. When the [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide|Emperor of Mexico]] abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe Federal Republic of Central America was a [[representative democracy]] with its capital at [[Guatemala City]]. This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]], [[Mosquito Coast]], and Nicaragua. The lowlands of southwest Chiapas, including Soconusco, initially belonged to the Republic until 1824, when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco. The Republic lasted from 1823 to 1838, when it disintegrated as a result of civil wars.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=2 widths=100 heights=100 mode=nolines caption=\"Historic Coat of Arms of Central American Unions\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Escudo de las Provincias Unidas del Centro de Am\u00e9rica.svg|The United Provinces of Central America\nFile:Escudo de la Rep\u00fablica Federal de Centro Am\u00e9rica.svg|[[Federal Republic of Central America]]\nFile:Escudo de la Representaci\u00f3n Nacional de Centroam\u00e9rica.svg|National Representation of Central America\nFile:Coat of arms of the Greater Republic of Central America (1898).svg|[[Greater Republic of Central America]]\n</gallery>\n}}\n\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=3 widths=80 heights=80 mode=nolines caption=\"Coat of Arms of modern Central America\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Coat of arms of Guatemala.svg|[[Guatemala]]\nFile:Coat of arms of El Salvador.svg|[[El Salvador]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Honduras.svg|[[Honduras]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Nicaragua.svg|[[Nicaragua]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Costa Rica.svg|[[Costa Rica]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Panama.svg|[[Panama]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Belize.svg|[[Belize]]\n</gallery>\n}}\nThe territory that now makes up Belize was heavily contested in a dispute that continued for decades after Guatemala achieved independence (see [[History of Belize (1506\u20131862)]].

It became independent as Belize in 1981.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nPanama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the [[Isthmus of Panama]], has for most of its history been culturally and politically linked to South America. Panama was part of the [[Province of Tierra Firme]] from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed ''Audiencia Real de Panama''. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], the capital of which was located at [[Bogot\u00e1|Santa F\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1]]. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of [[Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada|military and political struggles]] took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the [[Republic of New Granada]]. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as [[Panama State]], first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the [[Granadine Confederation]], and finally within the [[United States of Colombia]]. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the [[Colombia|Republic of Colombia]] in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the [[Isthmus Department]]. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|secession of Panama]] on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nBy the 1930s the [[United Fruit Company]] owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala. Such holdings gave it great power over the governments of small countries. That was one of the factors that led to the coining of the phrase [[banana republic]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Livingstone|first=Grace|title=America's Backyard: The United States and Latin America from the Monroe Doctrine to the War on Terror|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WH5jDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT31|year=2013|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|isbn=978-1-84813-611-3|page=31}}</ref>\n\nAfter more than two hundred years of social unrest, violent conflict, and revolution, Central America today remains in a period of political transformation.

The pine-oak forests lie between {{convert|600|-|1800|m|ft}} elevation,<ref name=WWF0303 /> and are surrounded at lower elevations by [[tropical moist forests]] and [[tropical dry forests]]. Higher elevations above {{convert|1800|m|ft}} are usually covered with [[Central American montane forests]]. The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including [[oak]], [[pine]], [[fir]], and [[cypress]].\n\n[[Laurel forest]] is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen [[cloud forest]], found in almost all Central American countries, normally more than {{convert|1000|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level.

In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras, but many were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the [[Mombacho]] volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de [[Tilar\u00e1n]] and [[Volc\u00e1n Arenal]], called [[Monteverde]], also in the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]].\n\nThe [[Central American montane forests]] are an ecoregion of the [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] biome, as defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund]].<ref name=WWF0112 /> These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer [[wet season]] and a cooler winter dry season. Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from {{convert|1800|-|4000|m|ft}}, on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico, through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, to northern Nicaragua.

Almost half of the bird population of the [[Talamancan montane forests]] in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the [[resplendent quetzal]] (Pharomacrus mocinno), [[three-wattled bellbird]] (Procnias tricarunculata), [[bare-necked umbrellabird]] (Cephalopterus glabricollis), and [[black guan]] (Chamaepetes unicolor). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The [[golden toad]] that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, which is part of the Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extinction are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of that frog is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. [[Jaguar]]s, [[cougar]]s, [[spider monkey]]s, as well as [[tapir]]s, and [[anteater]]s live in the woods of Central America.<ref name=WWF0167 /> The [[Central American red brocket]] is a brocket deer found in Central America's tropical forest.\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:Tectonic plates Caribbean.png|thumb|Central America and the [[Caribbean Plate]]]]\n{{See also|Central America Volcanic Arc|List of earthquakes in Costa Rica|List of earthquakes in El Salvador|List of earthquakes in Guatemala|List of earthquakes in Nicaragua}}\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=2 widths=70 heights=70 mode=nolines caption=\"Central American Geology\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Lago de coatepeque de color.jpg|[[Coatepeque Caldera]], [[El Salvador]]\nFile:Atitlan Lake and Volcanoes (3746396035).jpg|[[Lake Atitl\u00e1n]], [[Guatemala]]\nFile:Mombacho.JPG|[[Mombacho]], [[Nicaragua]]\nFile:Arenal Volcano in Costa Rica.JPG|[[Arenal Volcano]], [[Costa Rica]]\n</gallery>\n}}\n\nCentral America is geologically very active, with [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]] and earthquakes occurring frequently, and [[tsunami]]s occurring occasionally. Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters.\n\nMost of Central America rests atop the [[Caribbean Plate]]. This [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] converges with the [[Cocos Plate|Cocos]], [[Nazca Plate|Nazca]], and [[North American Plate|North American]] plates to form the [[Middle America Trench]], a major [[subduction]] zone. The Middle America Trench is situated some {{convert|60-160|km|mi|sp=us}} off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench.<ref name=Astiz1987 /> For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]] that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in [[1902 Guatemala earthquake|1902]], [[1942 Guatemala earthquake|1942]], [[1956 Nicaragua earthquake|1956]], [[1982 El Salvador earthquake|1982]], [[1992 Nicaragua earthquake|1992]], [[2001 El Salvador earthquakes|2001]], [[2007 Guatemala earthquake|2007]], [[2012 Guatemala earthquake|2012]], [[October 2014 Nicaragua earthquake|2014]], and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.\n\nThe Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The [[Motagua Fault]] is an onshore continuation of the [[Cayman Trough]] which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This [[transform fault]] cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near [[Acapulco]]. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in [[1717 Guatemala earthquake|1717]], [[1773 Guatemala earthquake|1773]], [[1902 Guatemala earthquake|1902]], [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976]], [[1980 Honduras earthquake|1980]], and [[2009 Honduras earthquake|2009]].\n\nAnother onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the [[Chixoy-Polochic Fault]], which runs parallel to, and roughly {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.<ref name=White1985 />\n\n[[Managua]], the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake|1931]] and [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972]].\n\nVolcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the [[Arenal Volcano]], in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{See also|Ethnic groups in Central America|Latin Americans}}\n\nThe population of Central America is estimated at 47,448,333<!-- 2016 --> as of {{UN Population|Year}}.{{UN Population|ref}} With an area of {{convert|523780|km2|sqmi|sp=us}},<ref name=handbook2013 /> it has a population density of {{convert|91|/km2|/sqmi|sp=us}}.

However, the unity of the ODECA was limited by conflicts between several member states.\n\nIn 1991, the integration agenda was further advanced by the creation of the [[Central American Integration System]] (''Sistema para la Integraci\u00f3n Centroamericana'', or SICA). SICA provides a clear legal basis to avoid disputes between the member states. SICA membership includes the 7 nations of Central America plus the [[Dominican Republic]], a state that is traditionally considered part of the Caribbean.\n\nOn 6 December 2008, SICA announced an agreement to pursue a common currency and common passport for the member nations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20081206-central-american-leaders-agree-common-currency-|title=Central American leaders agree on common currency|work=France 24|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US}}</ref> No timeline for implementation was discussed.\n\nCentral America already has several supranational institutions such as the [[Central American Parliament]], the [[Central American Bank for Economic Integration]] and the [[Central American Common Market]].\n\nOn 22 July 2011, President [[Mauricio Funes]] of El Salvador became the first president ''[[pro tempore]]'' to SICA.

The parliament started around 1980, and its primary goal was to resolve conflicts in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Although the group was disbanded in 1986, ideas of unity of Central Americans still remained, so a treaty was signed in 1987 to create the Central American Parliament and other political bodies. Its original members were Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. The parliament is the political organ of Central America, and is part of SICA. New members have since then joined including Panama and the Dominican Republic.\n\nCosta Rica is not a member State of the Central American Parliament and its adhesion remains as a very unpopular topic at all levels of the Costa Rican society due to existing strong political criticism towards the regional parliament, since it is regarded by Costa Ricans as a menace to democratic accountability and effectiveness of integration efforts. Excessively high salaries for its members, legal immunity of jurisdiction from any member State, corruption, lack of a binding nature and effectiveness of the regional parliament's decisions, high operative costs and immediate membership of Central American Presidents once they leave their office and presidential terms, are the most common reasons invoked by Costa Ricans against the Central American Parliament.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n{{Clear left}}\n\n== Economy ==\n{{See also|Economy of Belize|Economy of Costa Rica|Economy of El Salvador|Economy of Guatemala|Economy of Honduras|Economy of Nicaragua|Economy of Panama}}\n[[File:Federal Republic of Central America 1835 4 Real.jpg|thumb|Federal Republic of Central America, 4 Escudos (1835).

The treaty is aimed at promoting [[free trade]] among its members.\n\nGuatemala has the largest economy in the region.<ref name=IMFWEO2012 /><ref name=IMFGDP2012 /> Its main exports are coffee, sugar, bananas, petroleum, clothing, and [[cardamom]]. Of its 10.29 billion dollar annual exports,<ref name=ciaexport /> 40.2% go to the United States, 11.1% to neighboring El Salvador, 8% to Honduras, 5.5% to Mexico, 4.7% to Nicaragua, and 4.3% to Costa Rica.<ref name=ciaexportgu />\n\nThe region is particularly attractive for companies (especially clothing companies) because of its geographical proximity to the[United States], very low wages and considerable tax advantages. In addition, the decline in the prices of coffee and other export products and the structural adjustment measures promoted by the international financial institutions have partly ruined agriculture, favouring the emergence of maquiladoras. This sector accounts for 42 per cent of total exports from [[El Salvador]], 55 per cent from [[Guatemala]], and 65 per cent from [[Honduras]]. However, its contribution to the economies of these countries is disputed; raw materials are imported, jobs are precarious and low-paid, and tax exemptions weaken public finances.<ref name=\"insumisos.com\">https://www.insumisos.com/diplo/NODE/663.HTM</ref>\n\nThey are also criticised for the working conditions of employees: insults and physical violence, abusive dismissals (especially of pregnant workers), working hours, non-payment of overtime. According to Lucrecia Bautista, coordinator of the''maquilas'' sector of the audit firm Coverco,''labour law regulations are regularly violated in maquilas and there is no political will to enforce their application. In the case of infringements, the labour inspectorate shows remarkable leniency. It is a question of not discouraging investors. \"Trade unionists are subject to pressure, and sometimes to kidnapping or murder. In some cases, business leaders have used the services of the [[Maras (gang)|maras]].

Due to the presence of several [[active fault|active geologic faults]] and the [[Central America Volcanic Arc]], there is a great deal of seismic activity in the region, such as [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]] and earthquakes, which has resulted in death, injury and property damage.\n\nIn the [[Pre-Columbian era]], Central America was inhabited by the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] peoples of Mesoamerica to the north and west and the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area|Isthmo-Colombian]] peoples to the south and east. Following the Spanish expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages to the [[Americas]], Spain began to [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonize the Americas]]. From 1609 to 1821, the majority of Central American territories (except for what would become Belize and Panama, and including the modern Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) were governed by the viceroyalty of [[New Spain]] from [[Mexico City]] as the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]]. On 24 August 1821, Spanish Viceroy [[Juan O'Donoj\u00fa|Juan de O'Donoj\u00fa]] signed the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]], which established New Spain's independence from Spain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/spain-accepts-mexican-independence|title=Spain accepts Mexican independence|last=Editors|first=History com|website=HISTORY|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> On 15 September 1821, the [[Act of Independence of Central America]] was enacted to announce Central America's separation from the [[Spanish Empire]] and provide for the establishment of a new [[Federal Republic of Central America|Central American state]]. Some of New Spain's provinces in the Central American region (i.e. what would become [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]] and [[Costa Rica]]) were annexed to the [[First Mexican Empire]]; however, in 1823 they seceded from Mexico to form the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] until 1838.\n\nIn 1838, [[Nicaragua]], [[Honduras]], [[Costa Rica]] and [[Guatemala]] became the first of Central America's seven states to become independent autonomous countries, followed by [[El Salvador]] in 1841, [[Panama]] in 1903 and [[Belize]] in 1981{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}. Despite the dissolution of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]], there is anecdotal evidence that demonstrates that [[Salvadorans]], [[Panamanians]], [[Costa Ricans]], [[Guatemalans]], [[Hondurans]] and [[Nicaraguans]] continue to maintain a Central American identity. For instance, Central Americans sometimes refer to their nations as if they were provinces of a Central American state. It is not unusual to write \"C.A.\" after the country's name in formal and informal contexts. Governments in the region sometimes reinforce this sense of belonging to Central America in its citizens. For example, automobile licence plates in many of the region's countries include the moniker, ''Centroamerica,'' alongside the country's name.

Most notable among these were the [[Maya peoples|Mayans]], who had built numerous cities throughout the region, and the [[Aztec]]s, who had created a vast empire. The pre-Columbian cultures of eastern [[El Salvador]], eastern [[Honduras]], Caribbean [[Nicaragua]], most of [[Costa Rica]] and [[Panama]] were predominantly speakers of the [[Chibchan languages]] at the time of European contact and are considered by some<ref name=\"Hoopes&Fonseca2003\" /> culturally different and grouped in the [[Isthmo-Colombian Area]].\n\nFollowing the Spanish expedition of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s voyages to the Americas, the Spanish sent many expeditions to the region, and they began their conquest of [[Maya civilization|Maya territory]] in 1523. Soon after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Pedro de Alvarado]] commenced the [[Spanish conquest of Guatemala|conquest of northern Central America]] for the [[Spanish Empire]]. Beginning with his arrival in [[Soconusco]] in 1523, Alvarado's forces systematically conquered and subjugated most of the major Maya kingdoms, including the [[K'iche' Kingdom of Q'umarkaj|K'iche']], [[Tz'utujil people|Tz'utujil]], [[Pipil people|Pipil]], and the [[Kaqchikel people|Kaqchikel]]. By 1528, the conquest of Guatemala was nearly complete, with only the [[Pet\u00e9n Basin]] remaining outside the Spanish sphere of influence. The last independent Maya kingdoms \u2013 the [[Kowoj]] and the [[Itza people]] \u2013 were finally defeated in 1697, as part of the [[Spanish conquest of Pet\u00e9n]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nIn 1538, Spain established the [[Real Audiencia of Panama#First installation|Real Audiencia of Panama]], which had jurisdiction over all land from the [[Strait of Magellan]] to the [[Gulf of Fonseca]]. This entity was dissolved in 1543, and most of the territory within Central America then fell under the jurisdiction of the ''[[Real Audiencia of Guatemala|Audiencia Real de Guatemala]]''. This area included the current territories of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]], but excluded the lands that would become Belize and Panama. The president of the Audiencia, which had its seat in [[Antigua Guatemala]], was the governor of the entire area. In 1609 the area became a [[Captaincies of the Spanish Empire|captaincy general]] and the governor was also granted the title of captain general. The [[Captaincy General of Guatemala]] encompassed most of Central America, with the exception of [[British Honduras|present-day Belize]] and Panama.\n\nThe Captaincy General of Guatemala lasted for more than two centuries, but began to fray after a [[1811 Independence Movement|rebellion in 1811]] which began in the [[Intendant#Spain and the Spanish Empire|intendancy]] of San Salvador. The Captaincy General formally ended on 15 September 1821, with the signing of the [[Act of Independence of Central America]]. Mexican independence was achieved at virtually the same time with the signing of the [[Treaty of C\u00f3rdoba]] and the [[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire]], and the entire region was finally independent from Spanish authority by 28 September 1821.\n\n[[File:Salcoatit\u00e1n, El Salvador - panoramio (9).jpg|thumb|250px|The five rowed volcanos in the coat of arms of Central America was inspired by the [[Cordillera de Apaneca]] volcanic range of [[El Salvador]], visible from the city of [[Sonsonate]], which became the capital of the [[Federal Republic of Central America]] in 1834.]]\n\nFrom its independence from Spain in 1821 until 1823, the former Captaincy General remained intact as part of the short-lived [[First Mexican Empire]]. When the [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide|Emperor of Mexico]] abdicated on 19 March 1823, Central America again became independent. On 1 July 1823, the Congress of Central America peacefully seceded from Mexico and declared absolute independence from all foreign nations, and the region formed the [[Federal Republic of Central America]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe Federal Republic of Central America was a [[representative democracy]] with its capital at [[Guatemala City]]. This union consisted of the provinces of Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, [[Los Altos, Central America|Los Altos]], [[Mosquito Coast]], and Nicaragua. The lowlands of southwest Chiapas, including Soconusco, initially belonged to the Republic until 1824, when Mexico annexed most of Chiapas and began its claims to Soconusco.

It became independent as Belize in 1981.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nPanama, situated in the southernmost part of Central America on the [[Isthmus of Panama]], has for most of its history been culturally and politically linked to South America. Panama was part of the [[Province of Tierra Firme]] from 1510 until 1538 when it came under the jurisdiction of the newly formed ''Audiencia Real de Panama''. Beginning in 1543, Panama was administered as part of the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], along with all other Spanish possessions in South America. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1739, when it was transferred to the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], the capital of which was located at [[Bogot\u00e1|Santa F\u00e9 de Bogot\u00e1]]. Panama remained as part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada until the disestablishment of that viceroyalty in 1819. A series of [[Bol\u00edvar's campaign to liberate New Granada|military and political struggles]] took place from that time until 1822, the result of which produced the republic of [[Gran Colombia]]. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1830, Panama became part of a successor state, the [[Republic of New Granada]]. From 1855 until 1886, Panama existed as [[Panama State]], first within the Republic of New Granada, then within the [[Granadine Confederation]], and finally within the [[United States of Colombia]]. The United States of Colombia was replaced by the [[Colombia|Republic of Colombia]] in 1886. As part of the Republic of Colombia, Panama State was abolished and it became the [[Isthmus Department]]. Despite the many political reorganizations, Colombia was still deeply plagued by conflict, which eventually led to the [[Separation of Panama from Colombia|secession of Panama]] on 3 November 1903. Only after that time did some begin to regard Panama as a North or Central American entity.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nBy the 1930s the [[United Fruit Company]] owned 3.5 million acres of land in Central America and the Caribbean and was the single largest land owner in Guatemala.

In 2010 Belize had 63% of remaining forest cover, Costa Rica 46%, Panama 45%, Honduras 41%, Guatemala 37%, Nicaragua 29%, and El Salvador 21%. Most of the loss occurred in the moist forest [[biome]], with {{convert|12201|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}.

The Central American pine-oak forests occupy an area of {{convert|111400|km2|sqmi|sp=us}},<ref name=WWF0303 /> extending along the mountainous spine of Central America, extending from the [[Sierra Madre de Chiapas]] in Mexico's [[Chiapas]] state through the highlands of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to central Nicaragua. The pine-oak forests lie between {{convert|600|-|1800|m|ft}} elevation,<ref name=WWF0303 /> and are surrounded at lower elevations by [[tropical moist forests]] and [[tropical dry forests]]. Higher elevations above {{convert|1800|m|ft}} are usually covered with [[Central American montane forests]]. The Central American pine-oak forests are composed of many species characteristic of temperate North America including [[oak]], [[pine]], [[fir]], and [[cypress]].\n\n[[Laurel forest]] is the most common type of Central American temperate evergreen [[cloud forest]], found in almost all Central American countries, normally more than {{convert|1000|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level.

In some areas of southeastern Honduras there are cloud forests, the largest located near the border with Nicaragua. In Nicaragua, cloud forests are situated near the border with Honduras, but many were cleared to grow coffee. There are still some temperate evergreen hills in the north. The only cloud forest in the Pacific coastal zone of Central America is on the [[Mombacho]] volcano in Nicaragua. In Costa Rica, there are laurel forests in the Cordillera de [[Tilar\u00e1n]] and [[Volc\u00e1n Arenal]], called [[Monteverde]], also in the [[Cordillera de Talamanca]].\n\nThe [[Central American montane forests]] are an ecoregion of the [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] biome, as defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund]].<ref name=WWF0112 /> These forests are of the moist deciduous and the semi-evergreen seasonal subtype of tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and receive high overall rainfall with a warm summer [[wet season]] and a cooler winter dry season. Central American montane forests consist of forest patches located at altitudes ranging from {{convert|1800|-|4000|m|ft}}, on the summits and slopes of the highest mountains in Central America ranging from Southern Mexico, through Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, to northern Nicaragua.

Almost half of the bird population of the [[Talamancan montane forests]] in Costa Rica and Panama are endemic to this region. Several birds are listed as threatened, most notably the [[resplendent quetzal]] (Pharomacrus mocinno), [[three-wattled bellbird]] (Procnias tricarunculata), [[bare-necked umbrellabird]] (Cephalopterus glabricollis), and [[black guan]] (Chamaepetes unicolor). Many of the amphibians are endemic and depend on the existence of forest. The [[golden toad]] that once inhabited a small region in the Monteverde Reserve, which is part of the Talamancan montane forests, has not been seen alive since 1989 and is listed as extinct by IUCN. The exact causes for its extinction are unknown. Global warming may have played a role, because the development of that frog is typical for this area may have been compromised. Seven small mammals are endemic to the Costa Rica-Chiriqui highlands within the Talamancan montane forest region. [[Jaguar]]s, [[cougar]]s, [[spider monkey]]s, as well as [[tapir]]s, and [[anteater]]s live in the woods of Central America.<ref name=WWF0167 /> The [[Central American red brocket]] is a brocket deer found in Central America's tropical forest.\n\n== Geology ==\n[[File:Tectonic plates Caribbean.png|thumb|Central America and the [[Caribbean Plate]]]]\n{{See also|Central America Volcanic Arc|List of earthquakes in Costa Rica|List of earthquakes in El Salvador|List of earthquakes in Guatemala|List of earthquakes in Nicaragua}}\n{{image frame|content=\n<gallery perrow=2 widths=70 heights=70 mode=nolines caption=\"Central American Geology\" style=\"line-height:130%\">\nFile:Lago de coatepeque de color.jpg|[[Coatepeque Caldera]], [[El Salvador]]\nFile:Atitlan Lake and Volcanoes (3746396035).jpg|[[Lake Atitl\u00e1n]], [[Guatemala]]\nFile:Mombacho.JPG|[[Mombacho]], [[Nicaragua]]\nFile:Arenal Volcano in Costa Rica.JPG|[[Arenal Volcano]], [[Costa Rica]]\n</gallery>\n}}\n\nCentral America is geologically very active, with [[Types of volcanic eruptions|volcanic eruptions]] and earthquakes occurring frequently, and [[tsunami]]s occurring occasionally. Many thousands of people have died as a result of these natural disasters.\n\nMost of Central America rests atop the [[Caribbean Plate]]. This [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] converges with the [[Cocos Plate|Cocos]], [[Nazca Plate|Nazca]], and [[North American Plate|North American]] plates to form the [[Middle America Trench]], a major [[subduction]] zone. The Middle America Trench is situated some {{convert|60-160|km|mi|sp=us}} off the Pacific coast of Central America and runs roughly parallel to it. Many large earthquakes have occurred as a result of seismic activity at the Middle America Trench.<ref name=Astiz1987 /> For example, subduction of the Cocos Plate beneath the North American Plate at the Middle America Trench is believed to have caused the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]] that killed as many as 40,000 people. Seismic activity at the Middle America Trench is also responsible for earthquakes in [[1902 Guatemala earthquake|1902]], [[1942 Guatemala earthquake|1942]], [[1956 Nicaragua earthquake|1956]], [[1982 El Salvador earthquake|1982]], [[1992 Nicaragua earthquake|1992]], [[2001 El Salvador earthquakes|2001]], [[2007 Guatemala earthquake|2007]], [[2012 Guatemala earthquake|2012]], [[October 2014 Nicaragua earthquake|2014]], and many other earthquakes throughout Central America.\n\nThe Middle America Trench is not the only source of seismic activity in Central America. The [[Motagua Fault]] is an onshore continuation of the [[Cayman Trough]] which forms part of the tectonic boundary between the North American Plate and the Caribbean Plate. This [[transform fault]] cuts right across Guatemala and then continues offshore until it merges with the Middle America Trench along the Pacific coast of Mexico, near [[Acapulco]]. Seismic activity at the Motagua Fault has been responsible for earthquakes in [[1717 Guatemala earthquake|1717]], [[1773 Guatemala earthquake|1773]], [[1902 Guatemala earthquake|1902]], [[1976 Guatemala earthquake|1976]], [[1980 Honduras earthquake|1980]], and [[2009 Honduras earthquake|2009]].\n\nAnother onshore continuation of the Cayman Trough is the [[Chixoy-Polochic Fault]], which runs parallel to, and roughly {{convert|80|km|mi|sp=us}} to the north, of the Motagua Fault. Though less active than the Motagua Fault, seismic activity at the Chixoy-Polochic Fault is still thought to be capable of producing very large earthquakes, such as the 1816 earthquake of Guatemala.<ref name=White1985 />\n\n[[Managua]], the capital of Nicaragua, was devastated by earthquakes in [[1931 Nicaragua earthquake|1931]] and [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972]].\n\nVolcanic eruptions are also common in Central America. In 1968 the [[Arenal Volcano]], in Costa Rica, erupted killing 87 people as the 3 villages of Tabacon, Pueblo Nuevo and San Luis were buried under pyroclastic flows and debris. Fertile soils from weathered volcanic lava have made it possible to sustain dense populations in the agriculturally productive highland areas.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{See also|Ethnic groups in Central America|Latin Americans}}\n\nThe population of Central America is estimated at 47,448,333<!-- 2016 --> as of {{UN Population|Year}}.{{UN Population|ref}} With an area of {{convert|523780|km2|sqmi|sp=us}},<ref name=handbook2013 /> it has a population density of {{convert|91|/km2|/sqmi|sp=us}}.

However, the unity of the ODECA was limited by conflicts between several member states.\n\nIn 1991, the integration agenda was further advanced by the creation of the [[Central American Integration System]] (''Sistema para la Integraci\u00f3n Centroamericana'', or SICA). SICA provides a clear legal basis to avoid disputes between the member states. SICA membership includes the 7 nations of Central America plus the [[Dominican Republic]], a state that is traditionally considered part of the Caribbean.\n\nOn 6 December 2008, SICA announced an agreement to pursue a common currency and common passport for the member nations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20081206-central-american-leaders-agree-common-currency-|title=Central American leaders agree on common currency|work=France 24|access-date=2018-03-05|language=en-US}}</ref> No timeline for implementation was discussed.\n\nCentral America already has several supranational institutions such as the [[Central American Parliament]], the [[Central American Bank for Economic Integration]] and the [[Central American Common Market]].\n\nOn 22 July 2011, President [[Mauricio Funes]] of El Salvador became the first president ''[[pro tempore]]'' to SICA.

The parliament started around 1980, and its primary goal was to resolve conflicts in Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Although the group was disbanded in 1986, ideas of unity of Central Americans still remained, so a treaty was signed in 1987 to create the Central American Parliament and other political bodies. Its original members were Guatemala, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras. The parliament is the political organ of Central America, and is part of SICA. New members have since then joined including Panama and the Dominican Republic.\n\nCosta Rica is not a member State of the Central American Parliament and its adhesion remains as a very unpopular topic at all levels of the Costa Rican society due to existing strong political criticism towards the regional parliament, since it is regarded by Costa Ricans as a menace to democratic accountability and effectiveness of integration efforts. Excessively high salaries for its members, legal immunity of jurisdiction from any member State, corruption, lack of a binding nature and effectiveness of the regional parliament's decisions, high operative costs and immediate membership of Central American Presidents once they leave their office and presidential terms, are the most common reasons invoked by Costa Ricans against the Central American Parliament.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n{{Clear left}}\n\n== Economy ==\n{{See also|Economy of Belize|Economy of Costa Rica|Economy of El Salvador|Economy of Guatemala|Economy of Honduras|Economy of Nicaragua|Economy of Panama}}\n[[File:Federal Republic of Central America 1835 4 Real.jpg|thumb|Federal Republic of Central America, 4 Escudos (1835).

The treaty is aimed at promoting [[free trade]] among its members.\n\nGuatemala has the largest economy in the region.<ref name=IMFWEO2012 /><ref name=IMFGDP2012 /> Its main exports are coffee, sugar, bananas, petroleum, clothing, and [[cardamom]]. Of its 10.29 billion dollar annual exports,<ref name=ciaexport /> 40.2% go to the United States, 11.1% to neighboring El Salvador, 8% to Honduras, 5.5% to Mexico, 4.7% to Nicaragua, and 4.3% to Costa Rica.<ref name=ciaexportgu />\n\nThe region is particularly attractive for companies (especially clothing companies) because of its geographical proximity to the[United States], very low wages and considerable tax advantages. In addition, the decline in the prices of coffee and other export products and the structural adjustment measures promoted by the international financial institutions have partly ruined agriculture, favouring the emergence of maquiladoras. This sector accounts for 42 per cent of total exports from [[El Salvador]], 55 per cent from [[Guatemala]], and 65 per cent from [[Honduras]]. However, its contribution to the economies of these countries is disputed; raw materials are imported, jobs are precarious and low-paid, and tax exemptions weaken public finances.<ref name=\"insumisos.com\">https://www.insumisos.com/diplo/NODE/663.HTM</ref>\n\nThey are also criticised for the working conditions of employees: insults and physical violence, abusive dismissals (especially of pregnant workers), working hours, non-payment of overtime. According to Lucrecia Bautista, coordinator of the''maquilas'' sector of the audit firm Coverco,''labour law regulations are regularly violated in maquilas and there is no political will to enforce their application. In the case of infringements, the labour inspectorate shows remarkable leniency. It is a question of not discouraging investors. \"Trade unionists are subject to pressure, and sometimes to kidnapping or murder. In some cases, business leaders have used the services of the [[Maras (gang)|maras]].

The film debuted at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]] and made $63,165 in the U.S. box office through October 11, 2007.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |title=The Nines (2007) - |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nines.htm |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>\n\n==Narrative structure==\nThe film is broken into three chapters centred around three men (all played by [[Ryan Reynolds]]) who try to uncover the secret about strange happenings in their, at times overlapping, lives.\n\n===\"Chapter One: The Prisoner\"===\nGary is a troubled actor who is wearing a green bracelet on his wrist, under [[house arrest]] living in another person's house because he burned down his own. The owner of the house is described as a TV writer away on work. While living in the house, he is befriended by both a P.R. \"handler\", Margaret, and the single mom next door, Sarah, who may or may not be interested in him romantically. Over the course of his house arrest, Gary becomes convinced that he is being haunted by the number nine, including finding a note saying \"Look for the nines\" in ''his'' handwriting. He encounters many occurrences of the number nine: while playing backgammon, he rolls nines; while reading newspaper advertisements, he becomes obsessed with finding nines. Asking Sarah about the [[9 (number)|number 9]] worries her, and she cryptically tells him: \"I can get you out of here\". He also sees different versions of himself around the house, which unsettles him, causing him to break out of his house arrest barrier, which in turn causes a blip in reality.\n\n===\"Chapter Two: Reality Television\"===\nA television writer Gavin is trying to get his [[Pilot episode|pilot]] produced. He leaves home to work on his TV show, ''Knowing'', about a mother and daughter who are lost, which stars his friend Melissa as the lead actress. In a conversation about reviews and critics Susan, a television executive and producer of the show, tells Gavin to look for the nines, which he then writes on a piece of paper, the same piece that Gary found in Part One. He also tells Melissa that he thinks he is haunted by ''himself''. During the process of post-production, Susan pushes for Gavin to ditch his friend Melissa as the unconventional lead of his project in favor of a more attractive, well-known actress. This causes an argument between him and Melissa. He then finds out that the well-known actress was actually cast in another show, which Susan knew of before suggesting her. Since she is now unavailable, and Melissa won't answer Gavin's calls, he confronts Susan about her knowing that his show would never get picked up and about him only being a subject on a [[reality television]] show. After a heated exchange, he snaps and slaps her. Seemingly insulting his manhood for hitting a woman, she scoffs: \"Do you think you are a man?\" and walks away, which leads to him telling the reality TV cameraman to leave him alone. A pedestrian then asks him who he is talking to, and it is shown that the reality television cameraman does not exist. He looks around and notices that everyone has a \"7\" floating above their heads and also that he has a \"9\" floating above his own.\n\nA flashback shows Gary's P.R. handler, Margaret, telling him that he is a God-like being and that God is a 10, humans are a 7, and that he is a 9 (koalas, incidentally, are 8s because they control weather), therefore he can destroy the world with a single thought, and that he exists in many different forms and that none of them are real. Gary does not believe this and flips out, which is revealed to be the real reason for his breaking his house arrest barrier.\n\n===\"Chapter Three: Knowing\"===\nAcclaimed [[video game designer]] Gabriel, whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, leaves his wife, Mary, and young daughter, Noelle, to try to get a better signal on his phone. He meets a woman, Sierra, who leads him off into the woods to her car, so she can give him a lift to the gas station. Meanwhile, back at the car Noelle watches a video on a digital camera showing Gavin talking to Melissa from Part Two and Margaret talking to Gary in Part One. She is confused and shows her mom, who appears confused as well.\n\nMeanwhile, Gabriel shows signs of intoxication, as Sierra had drugged water she was giving him with [[Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]]. She has been trying all along as Sarah, Sierra, Susan to separate the other three incarnations of \"G\" from Mary. That poisoning him with GHB was the only way to get him to stop long enough to reason with him. She calms Gabriel by telling him that this is an intervention, and they (the prostitute from part 1, and parole officer/agitated man), were trying to help him come home. She likens Gabriel's addiction to [[video game addiction]]. That Gabriel has been playing for 4,000 years, reincarnating into different roles to play with the humans. The 3 nines plead with him to come back home.\n\nBack at the car, Noelle has gone missing. Gabriel then returns to the car with Noelle in his arms, and the family goes home. Mary, who realizes that he is not who he seems, tells Gabriel that he needs to go and that the world is not real. Gabriel tells her that there were ninety different variations of the universe, and this is the last one. Gabriel then realizes that he must go and removes the green bracelet from his wrist, at which point the universe peels away into nothing. The film ends with Melissa McCarthy's character from all three parts married to Ben, whom she had been married to in Part Two, and Noelle as their daughter.

The film debuted at the [[2007 Sundance Film Festival]] and made $63,165 in the U.S. box office through October 11, 2007.<ref name=\"mojo\">{{cite web |title=The Nines (2007) - |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nines.htm |website=[[Box Office Mojo]]}}</ref>\n\n==Narrative structure==\nThe film is broken into three chapters centred around three men (all played by [[Ryan Reynolds]]) who try to uncover the secret about strange happenings in their, at times overlapping, lives.\n\n===\"Chapter One: The Prisoner\"===\nGary is a troubled actor who is wearing a green bracelet on his wrist, under [[house arrest]] living in another person's house because he burned down his own. The owner of the house is described as a TV writer away on work. While living in the house, he is befriended by both a P.R. \"handler\", Margaret, and the single mom next door, Sarah, who may or may not be interested in him romantically. Over the course of his house arrest, Gary becomes convinced that he is being haunted by the number nine, including finding a note saying \"Look for the nines\" in ''his'' handwriting. He encounters many occurrences of the number nine: while playing backgammon, he rolls nines; while reading newspaper advertisements, he becomes obsessed with finding nines. Asking Sarah about the [[9 (number)|number 9]] worries her, and she cryptically tells him: \"I can get you out of here\". He also sees different versions of himself around the house, which unsettles him, causing him to break out of his house arrest barrier, which in turn causes a blip in reality.\n\n===\"Chapter Two: Reality Television\"===\nA television writer Gavin is trying to get his [[Pilot episode|pilot]] produced. He leaves home to work on his TV show, ''Knowing'', about a mother and daughter who are lost, which stars his friend Melissa as the lead actress. In a conversation about reviews and critics Susan, a television executive and producer of the show, tells Gavin to look for the nines, which he then writes on a piece of paper, the same piece that Gary found in Part One. He also tells Melissa that he thinks he is haunted by ''himself''. During the process of post-production, Susan pushes for Gavin to ditch his friend Melissa as the unconventional lead of his project in favor of a more attractive, well-known actress. This causes an argument between him and Melissa. He then finds out that the well-known actress was actually cast in another show, which Susan knew of before suggesting her. Since she is now unavailable, and Melissa won't answer Gavin's calls, he confronts Susan about her knowing that his show would never get picked up and about him only being a subject on a [[reality television]] show. After a heated exchange, he snaps and slaps her. Seemingly insulting his manhood for hitting a woman, she scoffs: \"Do you think you are a man?\" and walks away, which leads to him telling the reality TV cameraman to leave him alone. A pedestrian then asks him who he is talking to, and it is shown that the reality television cameraman does not exist. He looks around and notices that everyone has a \"7\" floating above their heads and also that he has a \"9\" floating above his own.\n\nA flashback shows Gary's P.R. handler, Margaret, telling him that he is a God-like being and that God is a 10, humans are a 7, and that he is a 9 (koalas, incidentally, are 8s because they control weather), therefore he can destroy the world with a single thought, and that he exists in many different forms and that none of them are real. Gary does not believe this and flips out, which is revealed to be the real reason for his breaking his house arrest barrier.\n\n===\"Chapter Three: Knowing\"===\nAcclaimed [[video game designer]] Gabriel, whose car breaks down in the middle of nowhere, leaves his wife, Mary, and young daughter, Noelle, to try to get a better signal on his phone. He meets a woman, Sierra, who leads him off into the woods to her car, so she can give him a lift to the gas station. Meanwhile, back at the car Noelle watches a video on a digital camera showing Gavin talking to Melissa from Part Two and Margaret talking to Gary in Part One. She is confused and shows her mom, who appears confused as well.\n\nMeanwhile, Gabriel shows signs of intoxication, as Sierra had drugged water she was giving him with [[Gamma-hydroxybutyric acid|GHB]]. She has been trying all along as Sarah, Sierra, Susan to separate the other three incarnations of \"G\" from Mary. That poisoning him with GHB was the only way to get him to stop long enough to reason with him. She calms Gabriel by telling him that this is an intervention, and they (the prostitute from part 1, and parole officer/agitated man), were trying to help him come home. She likens Gabriel's addiction to [[video game addiction]]. That Gabriel has been playing for 4,000 years, reincarnating into different roles to play with the humans. The 3 nines plead with him to come back home.\n\nBack at the car, Noelle has gone missing. Gabriel then returns to the car with Noelle in his arms, and the family goes home. Mary, who realizes that he is not who he seems, tells Gabriel that he needs to go and that the world is not real. Gabriel tells her that there were ninety different variations of the universe, and this is the last one. Gabriel then realizes that he must go and removes the green bracelet from his wrist, at which point the universe peels away into nothing. The film ends with Melissa McCarthy's character from all three parts married to Ben, whom she had been married to in Part Two, and Noelle as their daughter. Noelle tells her mother that \"he's not coming back\" and that \"all the pieces have been put together\", and her mother finishes her sentence that this is \"the best of all possible worlds\".\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as Gary, a troubled actor/ Gavin, a TV writer/ and Gabriel, a Computer-Game designer\n* [[Melissa McCarthy]] as Margaret, Gary's PR handler/ Melissa, an actress in Gavin's TV show/ and Mary, Gabriel's wife.\n* [[Hope Davis]] as Sarah, Gary's Neighbor/ Susan, a TV executive for Gavin/ and Sierra, a mysterious woman who tries to help Gabriel\n* [[Elle Fanning]] as Noelle\n* [[David Denman]] as Parole Officer / Agitated Man / Nine \n* [[Octavia Spencer]] as Streetwalker (credited) / Pedestrian (uncredited) / Nine\n* [[Greg Baine]] as Delivery Guy time,\n\n==Production==\nThe movie was shot over 22 days in [[Los Angeles]] and two days in [[New York City|New York]],<ref name=\"So I made a movie\">{{Cite web| url = http://johnaugust.com/archives/2006/so-i-made-a-movie | title = So I made a movie | accessdate=2007-01-12 | work = John August}}</ref> with some scenes in John August's house.<ref name=\"Movies look nothing like reality\">{{Cite web| url = http://johnaugust.com/archives/2006/movies-look-nothing-like-reality | title = Movies look nothing like reality | accessdate=2007-01-12 | work = John August}}</ref> The movie was shot in a combination of video and film with everything being posted in [[high-definition video|high-definition]].<ref name=\"So I made a movie\"/>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n* \"You Keep Me Hangin' On\" Performed by [[The Ferris Wheel (band)|The Ferris Wheel]]\n* \"Trucha\" Performed by Ghostman MC\n* \"Alive Transmission\" Performed by [[The Shys]]\n* \"Hang On Little Tomata\" Performed by [[Pink Martini]]\n* \"Is That All There Is\" Performed by [[Hope Davis]]\n* \"Paper Plane\" Performed by [[Persephone's Bees]]\n* \"Teenage Villain\" Written by [[Keith Mansfield]]\n* \"Bang Bang to the Rock 'N' Roll\" Performed by [[Gabin (Italian band)|Gabin]]\n* \"Comet Samba\" Performed by Cabaret Diosa\n* \"Monokini Ou Bikini\" Performed by Georges Deligny\n* \"Romantico Bosanova\" Written by Philippe Bestion\n* \"As Long as He Needs Me\" Performed by [[Melissa McCarthy]]\n* \"Multiply\" Performed by [[Jamie Lidell]]\n* \"Sugar Town\" Performed by [[Juliet Turner]]\n* \"Myopia\" Performed by The Skeem\n* \"Tears Coming Home\" Performed by [[Sebastien Schuller]]\n* \"Chopin Nocturne 1, Opus 32\" Performed by Danielle Luppi\n* \"The Other Side of Mt.
