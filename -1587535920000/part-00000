The architect of divestiture for Southwestern Bell was Robert G. Pope. The company soon started a series of acquisitions. This includes the 1987 acquisition of [[Metromedia]] mobile business and the acquisition of several cable companies in the early 1990s. In the latter half of the 1990s, the company acquired several other telecommunications companies, including some Baby Bells, while selling its cable business. During this time, the company changed its name to SBC Communications. By 1998, the company was in the top 15 of the Fortune 500, and by 1999 the company was part of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (lasting through 2015).\n\n=== Purchase of former parent and acquisitions (2005\u20132014) ===\n{{See also|History of AT&T#Rise of SBC|History of AT&T#Post-consolidation wireless acquisitions}}\nIn 2005, SBC purchased AT&T for $16 billion.

The complaint alleges that, out of fears that fraudulent call volume would drop after the registration deadline, AT&T knowingly adopted a non-compliant registration system that did not verify whether the user was located within the United States. The complaint further contends that AT&T continued to employ this system even with the knowledge that it facilitated the use of IP Relay by fraudulent foreign callers, which accounted for up to 95 percent of AT&T's call volume. The government's complaint alleges that AT&T improperly billed the TRS Fund for reimbursement of these calls and received millions of dollars in federal payments as a result.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/March/12-civ-357.html |title=Welcome to the United States Department of Justice |publisher=Justice.gov |date=March 22, 2012 |accessdate=May 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519015822/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2012/March/12-civ-357.html |archive-date=May 19, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Racism ===\nOn April 28, 2015, AT&T announced that it had fired Aaron Slator, President of Content and Advertising Sales, for sending racist text messages.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/att-fires-president-racist-text-100m-lawsuit-30658834|title=Technology and Science News \u2014 ABC News|author=ABC News|website=ABC News|access-date=April 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150429063307/https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/att-fires-president-racist-text-100m-lawsuit-30658834|archive-date=April 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Slator was also hit with a $100 million discrimination lawsuit, filed by African-American employee Knoyme King.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/28/aaron-slator-t-president-fired-over-racist-text-me/|title=Aaron Slator, AT&T president, fired over racist text messages|website=The Washingtion Times|access-date=April 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501202930/http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/apr/28/aaron-slator-t-president-fired-over-racist-text-me/|archive-date=May 1, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The day before that, protesters arrived at AT&T's headquarters in Dallas and its satellite offices in Los Angeles as well as at the home of CEO Randall Stephenson to protest alleged systemic racial policies.

The Bell Telephone Company became the '''American Telephone and Telegraph Company''' in 1885 and was later rebranded as [[AT&T Corporation]]. The 1982 ''[[United States v. AT&T]]'' [[antitrust]] lawsuit resulted in the [[Bell System divestiture|divestiture]] of AT&T Corporation's (\"Ma Bell\") subsidiaries or [[Regional Bell Operating Companies]] (RBOCs), commonly referred to as  \"Baby Bells\", resulting in several independent companies, including Southwestern Bell Corporation; the latter changed its name to '''SBC Communications Inc.''' in 1995. In 2005, SBC purchased its former parent AT&T Corporation and took on its branding, with the merged entity naming itself AT&T Inc. and using its history, iconic logo and stock-trading symbol. In 2006, AT&T Inc. acquired [[BellSouth]], the last independent Baby Bell company, making its formerly joint venture [[Cingular|Cingular Wireless]] (which had acquired AT&T Wireless in 2004) wholly owned and rebranding it as [[AT&T Mobility]].\n\nThe current AT&T [[Breakup of the Bell System#Evolution of the Baby Bells|reconstitutes much of the former Bell System]], and includes ten of the original 22 Bell Operating Companies along with the original [[AT&T Communications|long distance division]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Kleinfield |first=Sony |year=1981 |title=The biggest company on earth: a profile of AT&T |location=New York |publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston |isbn=978-0-03-045326-7 |oclc= |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/biggestcompanyon00klei }}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Further|History of AT&T}}\n\n=== Origin and growth (1885\u20131981) ===\n{{See also|History of AT&T#Origins|History of AT&T#Monopoly}}\nAT&T traces its origins to the Bell Telephone Company, founded by Alexander Graham Bell, [[Gardiner Greene Hubbard]], and Thomas Sanders after Bell's patenting of the telephone.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.corp.att.com/history/|title=Home{{!}} History{{!}} AT&T|website=www.corp.att.com|language=en|accessdate=March 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161105114300/http://www.corp.att.com/history/|archive-date=November 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> One of that company's subsidiaries was the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T), established in 1885,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.corp.att.com/history/nethistory/milestones.html|title=History of the AT&T Network \u2014 Milestones in AT&T Network History{{!}} History{{!}} AT&T|website=www.corp.att.com|language=en|accessdate=April 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617093145/https://www.corp.att.com/history/nethistory/milestones.html|archive-date=June 17, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> which acquired the Bell Company on December 31, 1899, for legal reasons, leaving AT&T as the main company.

The architect of divestiture for Southwestern Bell was Robert G. Pope. The company soon started a series of acquisitions. This includes the 1987 acquisition of [[Metromedia]] mobile business and the acquisition of several cable companies in the early 1990s. In the latter half of the 1990s, the company acquired several other telecommunications companies, including some Baby Bells, while selling its cable business. During this time, the company changed its name to SBC Communications. By 1998, the company was in the top 15 of the Fortune 500, and by 1999 the company was part of the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] (lasting through 2015).\n\n=== Purchase of former parent and acquisitions (2005\u20132014) ===\n{{See also|History of AT&T#Rise of SBC|History of AT&T#Post-consolidation wireless acquisitions}}\nIn 2005, SBC purchased AT&T for $16 billion. After this purchase, SBC adopted the better-known AT&T name and brand, with the original AT&T Corp. still existing as the long-distance landline subsidiary of the merged company. The current AT&T claims the original AT&T Corp.'s history (dating to 1885) as its own.

{"title_page": "Book of Exodus", "text_new": "{{short description|Second book of the Bible}}\n{{About|the second book of the Bible|other uses|Exodus (disambiguation){{!}}Exodus}}\n\n[[File:The Crossing fo The Red Sea.jpg|thumb|300px|''Crossing of the Red Sea'', [[Nicholas Poussin]]]]\n{{Tanakh OT |Torah |Pentateuch}}\nThe '''Book of Exodus''' is the second book of the [[Bible]] and describes [[the Exodus]], which includes the [[Israelites]]' deliverance from slavery in Egypt through the hand of [[Yahweh]], the revelations at [[biblical Mount Sinai]], and the subsequent \"divine indwelling\" of God with Israel.{{sfn|Sparks|2010}}\n\nExodus is traditionally [[Mosaic authorship|ascribed to Moses]], but modern scholars see its initial composition as a product of the [[Babylonian captivity|Babylonian exile]] (6th century BCE), with final revisions in the [[Yehud Medinata|Persian post-exilic period]] (5th century BCE).{{sfn|Johnstone|2003|p=72}}{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2002|p=68}} [[Carol Meyers]], in her commentary on Exodus, suggests that it is arguably the most important book in the Bible, as it presents the defining features of Israel's identity\u2014memories of a past marked by hardship and escape, a binding covenant with God, who chooses Israel, and the establishment of the life of the community and the guidelines for sustaining it.<ref>Meyers, p. xv.</ref>\n\n==Name==\n[[File:1867 Edward Poynter - Israel in Egypt.jpg|thumb|400px|Children of Israel in Egypt (1867 painting by [[Edward Poynter]])]]\nThe English name ''Exodus'' comes from the {{lang-grc|\u1f14\u03be\u03bf\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}}, ''\u00e9xodos'', meaning \"going out\", from \u1f10\u03be-&nbsp;(ex,&nbsp;\u201cout\u201d)&nbsp;+&nbsp;\u1f41\u03b4\u03cc\u03c2&nbsp;(hod\u00f3s,&nbsp;\u201cpath, road\u201d). \n\nIn Hebrew the book's title is \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05d5\u05b9\u05ea, ''shem\u014dt'', \"Names\", from the [[Incipit|beginning words of the text]]: \"These are the names of the sons of Israel\" ({{lang-he-n|\u05d5\u05b0\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc\u05b6\u05bc\u05d4 \u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05b9\u05d5\u05ea \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e0\u05b5\u05d9 \u05d9\u05b4\u05e9\u05b0\u05c2\u05e8\u05b8\u05d0\u05b5\u05dc}}).{{sfn|Dozeman|2009|p=1}}\n\n== Structure ==\nThere is no unanimous agreement among scholars on the structure of Exodus. One strong possibility is that it is a [[diptych]] (i.e., divided into two parts), with the division between parts 1 and 2 at the [[crossing of the Red Sea]] or at the beginning of the [[theophany]] (appearance of God) in chapter 19.<ref>Meyers, p. 17.</ref> On this plan, the first part tells of God's rescue of his people from Egypt and their journey under his care to Sinai (chapters 1\u201319) and the second tells of the covenant between them (chapters 20\u201340).<ref>Stuart, p. 19.</ref>\n\n== Summary ==\n[[File:Dura Europos fresco Moses from river.jpg|thumb|''[[Finding of Moses]]'' in the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]], c. 244]]\n[[Jacob]]'s sons and their families join their brother [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] in Egypt, where they begin to grow in number. Egypt's [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Pharaoh]], fearful that the [[Israelites]] could become a [[fifth column]], forces the Israelites into slavery and orders the throwing of all newborn boys into the [[Nile]]. A [[Levite]] woman ([[Jochebed]], according to other sources) saves her baby by [[Finding of Moses|setting him adrift]] on the river Nile in an [[ark of bulrushes]]. [[Bithiah|Pharaoh's daughter]] finds the child, names him [[Moses]], and brings him up as her own. \n\nAware of his origins, an adult Moses kills an Egyptian overseer he finds beating a [[Hebrew]] slave and must flee into [[Midian]] to escape punishment. There he marries [[Zipporah]], daughter of Midianite priest [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], and encounters God in a [[burning bush]]. Moses asks God for his name, to which God replies: \"[[I Am that I Am]],\" the book's explanation for the origins of the name [[Yahweh]], as God is thereafter known. God tells Moses to return to Egypt and lead the Hebrews into [[Canaan]], the land promised to [[Abraham]].\n\nMoses returns to Egypt and fails to convince the Pharaoh to release the Israelites. God smites the Egyptians with [[Plagues of Egypt|ten terrible plagues]], among them a [[Plagues of Egypt#1. Water to Blood: Ex. 7:14\u201324|river of blood]], an [[plague of frogs|outbreak of frogs]], and the [[10th plague|death of all firstborn sons]]. Moses leads the Israelites out of bondage,\nprompting a [[Parting of the Red Sea|final pursuit]] through the [[Yam Suph|Red Sea]] by the forces of Pharaoh when Pharaoh reneges on his coerced consent. \n\nAs desert life proves arduous, the Israelites complain and long for Egypt, but God miraculously provides [[manna]] for them to eat and [[Meribah|water]] to drink. The Israelites arrive at the mountain of God, where Moses's father-in-law Jethro visits Moses; at his suggestion Moses appoints [[Biblical judges|judges]] over Israel. God asks whether they will agree to be his people. They accept. The people gather at the foot of the mountain, and with thunder and lightning, fire and clouds of smoke, the sound of trumpets, and the trembling of the mountain, [[theophany|God appears]] on the peak, and the people see the cloud and hear the voice (or possibly sound) of God. God tells Moses to ascend the mountain. God pronounces the [[Ten Commandments]] (the [[Ethical Decalogue]]) in the hearing of all Israel. Moses goes up the mountain into the [[presence of God]], who pronounces the [[Covenant Code]] of ritual and civil law and promises [[Canaan]] to them if they obey. Moses comes down the mountain and writes down God's words, and the people agree to keep them. God calls Moses up the mountain, where he remains for forty days and forty nights, at the conclusion of which he returns, bearing the set of stone [[tablet (religious)|tablets]].\n\nGod gives Moses instructions for the construction of the [[tabernacle (Judaism)|tabernacle]] so that God may dwell permanently among his [[chosen people]], along with instructions for the [[Priestly robe (Judaism)|priestly vestments]], the altar and its appurtenances, procedures for [[ordination]] of priests, and the daily [[sacrifice]] offerings. Aaron becomes the first [[High Priest of Israel|hereditary high priest]]. God gives Moses the two tablets of stone containing the words of the ten commandments, written with the [[Finger of God (Commandments)|\"finger of God\"]].<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|31:18}}; {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|9:10|9}}</ref>\n[[File:Gerrit de Wet - The Adoration of the Golden Calf - WGA25563.jpg|thumb|''Worship of the Golden Calf'', [[Gerrit de Wet]], 17th century]]\n\nWhile Moses is with God, Aaron casts a [[golden calf]], which the people worship. God informs Moses of their [[apostasy]] and threatens to kill them all, but relents when Moses pleads for them. Moses comes down from the mountain, smashes the stone tablets in anger, and commands the [[Levites]] to massacre the unfaithful Israelites. God commands Moses to construct two new tablets. Moses ascends the mountain again, where God dictates the [[Ritual Decalogue|Ten Commandments]] for Moses to write on the tablets.\n\nMoses descends from the mountain with a [[Transfiguration (religion)|transformed face]]; from that time onwards he must hide his face with a [[veil]]. Moses assembles the Hebrews and repeats to them the commandments he has received from God, which are to keep the [[Sabbath]] and to construct the Tabernacle. The Israelites do as they are commanded. From that time God dwells in the Tabernacle and orders the travels of the Hebrews.\n\n== Composition ==\n=== Authorship ===\nJewish and Christian tradition viewed [[Mosaic authorship|Moses as the author of Exodus]] and the entire [[Torah]], but by the end of the 19th century the increasing awareness of discrepancies, inconsistencies, repetitions and other features of the Pentateuch had led scholars to abandon this idea.{{sfn|Meyers|2005|p=16}} In approximate round dates, the process which produced Exodus and the Pentateuch probably began around 600 BCE when existing oral and written traditions were brought together to form books recognisable as those we know, reaching their final form as unchangeable sacred texts around 400 BCE.{{sfn|McEntire|2008|p=8}}\n\n=== Genre and sources ===\nThe story of [[the exodus]] is the [[founding myth]] of the Israelites, telling of their deliverance from slavery by [[Yahweh]] which made them his chosen people according to the [[Mosaic covenant]].{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}}  Fretheim says that it is not a historical narrative in any modern sense, instead its primary concern is theological.<ref name=\":0\">Fretheim, p. 8.</ref> It reflects common themes of past communities in exile, including facing foreign captivity and suffering under just judgment because of disloyalty to God.<ref name=\":0\" /> In Exodus, everything is presented as the work of God, who appears frequently in person.<ref>Houston, p. 68.</ref>\n\nAlthough mythical elements are not so prominent in Exodus as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], ancient legends may have an influence on the book's form or content: for example, the story of the infant Moses's salvation from the Nile is argued to be based on an earlier legend of king [[Sargon of Akkad]], while the story of the [[parting of the Red Sea]] may trade on Mesopotamian [[creation myth]]ology.  Similarly, the [[Covenant Code]] (the law code in Exodus 20:22\u201323:33) has some similarities in both content and structure with the [[Laws of Hammurabi]]. These influences serve to reinforce the conclusion that the Book of Exodus originated in the exiled Jewish community of 6th-century BCE [[Babylon]], but not all the sources are Mesopotamian: the story of Moses's flight to Midian following the murder of the Egyptian overseer may draw on the Egyptian ''[[Story of Sinuhe]]''.<ref>Kugler, Hartin, p. 74.</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\n[[File:David Roberts-IsraelitesLeavingEgypt 1828.jpg|thumb|300px|''Departure of the Israelites'' by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], 1829]]\n\n=== Salvation ===\nBiblical scholars describe the Bible's theologically-motivated history writing as \"[[salvation history]]\", meaning a history of God's saving actions that give identity to Israel \u2013 the promise of offspring and land to the ancestors, the exodus from Egypt (in which God saves Israel from slavery), the wilderness wandering, the revelation at Sinai, and the hope for the future life in the [[promised land]].<ref name=\"Dozeman\">Dozeman, p. 9.</ref>\n\n=== Theophany ===\nA [[theophany]] is a manifestation (appearance) of a god \u2013 in the Bible, an appearance of the God of Israel, accompanied by storms \u2013 the earth trembles, the mountains quake, the heavens pour rain, thunder peals and lightning flashes.<ref>Dozeman, p. 4.</ref> The theophany in Exodus begins \"the third day\" from their arrival at Sinai in chapter 19: Yahweh and the people meet at the mountain, God appears in the storm and converses with Moses, giving him the [[Ten Commandments]] while the people listen. The theophany is therefore a public experience of divine law.<ref>Dozeman, p. 427.</ref>\n\nThe second half of Exodus marks the point at which, and describes the process through which, God's theophany becomes a permanent presence for Israel via the [[Tabernacle]]. That so much of the book (chapters 25\u201331, 35\u201340) describes the plans of the Tabernacle demonstrates the importance it played in the perception of [[Second Temple Judaism]] at the time of the text's redaction by the Priestly writers: the Tabernacle is the place where God is physically present, where, through the priesthood, Israel could be in direct, literal communion with him.<ref>Dempster, p. 107.</ref>\n\n=== Covenant ===\nThe heart of Exodus is the [[Mosaic covenant|Sinaitic covenant]].<ref>Wenham, p. 29.</ref> A covenant is a legal document binding two parties to take on certain obligations towards each other.<ref>Meyers, p. 148.</ref> There are several covenants in the Bible, and in each case they exhibit at least some of the elements in real-life treaties of the ancient Middle East: a preamble, historical prologue, stipulations, deposition and reading, list of witnesses, blessings and curses, and ratification by animal sacrifice.<ref>Meyers, pp. 149\u2013150.</ref> Biblical covenants, in contrast to Eastern covenants in general, are between a god, Yahweh, and a people, Israel, instead of between a strong ruler and a weaker vassal.<ref>Meyers, p. 150.</ref>\n\n=== Election of Israel ===\nGod elects Israel for salvation because the \"sons of Israel\" are \"the firstborn son\" of the God of Israel, descended through Shem and Abraham to the chosen line of [[Jacob]] whose name is changed to Israel. The goal of the divine plan in Exodus is a return to humanity's state in [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], so that God can dwell with the Israelites as he had with [[Adam and Eve]] through the Ark and Tabernacle, which together form a model of the universe; in later [[Abrahamic religion]]s Israel becomes the guardian of God's plan for humanity, to bring \"God's creation blessing to mankind\" begun in Adam.<ref>Dempster, p. 100.</ref>\n\n== Weekly Torah portions ==\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 079.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Moses]] with the Ten Commandments, by [[Rembrandt]] (1659)]]\n{{main|Weekly Torah portion}}\n\n:*[[Shemot (parsha)|Shemot]], on Exodus 1\u20135: Affliction in Egypt, discovery of baby Moses, Pharaoh\n:*[[Va'eira (parsha)|Va'eira]], on Exodus 6\u20139: Plagues 1 to 7 of Egypt\n:*[[Bo (parsha)|Bo]], on Exodus 10\u201313: Last plagues of Egypt, first Passover\n:*[[Beshalach (parsha)|Beshalach]], on Exodus 13\u201317: Parting the Sea, water, manna, Amalek\n:*[[Yitro (parsha)|Yitro]], on Exodus 18\u201320: Jethro\u2019s advice, The Ten Commandments\n:*[[Mishpatim (parsha)|Mishpatim]], on Exodus 21\u201324: The Covenant Code\n:*[[Terumah (parsha)|Terumah]], on Exodus 25\u201327: God's instructions on the Tabernacle and furnishings\n:*[[Tetzaveh (parsha)|Tetzaveh]], on Exodus 27\u201330: God's instructions on the first priests\n:*[[Ki Tissa]], on Exodus 30\u201334: Census, anointing oil, golden calf, stone tablets, Moses radiant\n:*[[Vayakhel (parsha)|Vayakhel]], on Exodus 35\u201338: Israelites collect gifts, make the Tabernacle and furnishings\n:*[[Pekudei (parsha)|Pekudei]], on Exodus 38\u201340: Setting up and filling of The Tabernacle\n\n== Historicity ==\n{{multiple image | align. = left | width1 = 150\t| image1 = Exodus map.jpg | caption1 = 1585 map | width2 = 168\t| image2 = Wanderings in the desert map.jpg | caption2 = 1641 map | footer = Historical representations of the [[Stations of the Exodus]]}}\nThe overwhelming consensus among scholars is that the Exodus story is best understood literally. While archaeology has found traces left by even small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: \"The conclusion \u2013 that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible \u2013 seems irrefutable [...] repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence\" (Finkelstein and Silberman, 2001).{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|p=63}} Instead, modern archaeology suggests continuity between Canaanite and Israelite settlement, indicating a primarily Canaanite origin for Israel.{{sfn|Barmash|2015|p=4}}{{sfn|Shaw|2002|p=313}}\n\nAll scholars accept the biblical account of the Exodus as literal.

One strong possibility is that it is a [[diptych]] (i.e., divided into two parts), with the division between parts 1 and 2 at the [[crossing of the Red Sea]] or at the beginning of the [[theophany]] (appearance of God) in chapter 19.<ref>Meyers, p. 17.</ref> On this plan, the first part tells of God's rescue of his people from Egypt and their journey under his care to Sinai (chapters 1\u201319) and the second tells of the covenant between them (chapters 20\u201340).<ref>Stuart, p. 19.</ref>\n\n== Summary ==\n[[File:Dura Europos fresco Moses from river.jpg|thumb|''[[Finding of Moses]]'' in the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]], c. 244]]\n[[Jacob]]'s sons and their families join their brother [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]] in Egypt, where they begin to grow in number. Egypt's [[Pharaoh of the Exodus|Pharaoh]], fearful that the [[Israelites]] could become a [[fifth column]], forces the Israelites into slavery and orders the throwing of all newborn boys into the [[Nile]]. A [[Levite]] woman ([[Jochebed]], according to other sources) saves her baby by [[Finding of Moses|setting him adrift]] on the river Nile in an [[ark of bulrushes]]. [[Bithiah|Pharaoh's daughter]] finds the child, names him [[Moses]], and brings him up as her own. \n\nAware of his origins, an adult Moses kills an Egyptian overseer he finds beating a [[Hebrew]] slave and must flee into [[Midian]] to escape punishment. There he marries [[Zipporah]], daughter of Midianite priest [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], and encounters God in a [[burning bush]]. Moses asks God for his name, to which God replies: \"[[I Am that I Am]],\" the book's explanation for the origins of the name [[Yahweh]], as God is thereafter known. God tells Moses to return to Egypt and lead the Hebrews into [[Canaan]], the land promised to [[Abraham]].\n\nMoses returns to Egypt and fails to convince the Pharaoh to release the Israelites. God smites the Egyptians with [[Plagues of Egypt|ten terrible plagues]], among them a [[Plagues of Egypt#1. Water to Blood: Ex. 7:14\u201324|river of blood]], an [[plague of frogs|outbreak of frogs]], and the [[10th plague|death of all firstborn sons]]. Moses leads the Israelites out of bondage,\nprompting a [[Parting of the Red Sea|final pursuit]] through the [[Yam Suph|Red Sea]] by the forces of Pharaoh when Pharaoh reneges on his coerced consent. \n\nAs desert life proves arduous, the Israelites complain and long for Egypt, but God miraculously provides [[manna]] for them to eat and [[Meribah|water]] to drink. The Israelites arrive at the mountain of God, where Moses's father-in-law Jethro visits Moses; at his suggestion Moses appoints [[Biblical judges|judges]] over Israel. God asks whether they will agree to be his people. They accept. The people gather at the foot of the mountain, and with thunder and lightning, fire and clouds of smoke, the sound of trumpets, and the trembling of the mountain, [[theophany|God appears]] on the peak, and the people see the cloud and hear the voice (or possibly sound) of God. God tells Moses to ascend the mountain. God pronounces the [[Ten Commandments]] (the [[Ethical Decalogue]]) in the hearing of all Israel. Moses goes up the mountain into the [[presence of God]], who pronounces the [[Covenant Code]] of ritual and civil law and promises [[Canaan]] to them if they obey. Moses comes down the mountain and writes down God's words, and the people agree to keep them. God calls Moses up the mountain, where he remains for forty days and forty nights, at the conclusion of which he returns, bearing the set of stone [[tablet (religious)|tablets]].\n\nGod gives Moses instructions for the construction of the [[tabernacle (Judaism)|tabernacle]] so that God may dwell permanently among his [[chosen people]], along with instructions for the [[Priestly robe (Judaism)|priestly vestments]], the altar and its appurtenances, procedures for [[ordination]] of priests, and the daily [[sacrifice]] offerings. Aaron becomes the first [[High Priest of Israel|hereditary high priest]]. God gives Moses the two tablets of stone containing the words of the ten commandments, written with the [[Finger of God (Commandments)|\"finger of God\"]].<ref>{{Bibleref2|Exodus|31:18}}; {{bibleref2|Deuteronomy|9:10|9}}</ref>\n[[File:Gerrit de Wet - The Adoration of the Golden Calf - WGA25563.jpg|thumb|''Worship of the Golden Calf'', [[Gerrit de Wet]], 17th century]]\n\nWhile Moses is with God, Aaron casts a [[golden calf]], which the people worship. God informs Moses of their [[apostasy]] and threatens to kill them all, but relents when Moses pleads for them. Moses comes down from the mountain, smashes the stone tablets in anger, and commands the [[Levites]] to massacre the unfaithful Israelites. God commands Moses to construct two new tablets. Moses ascends the mountain again, where God dictates the [[Ritual Decalogue|Ten Commandments]] for Moses to write on the tablets.\n\nMoses descends from the mountain with a [[Transfiguration (religion)|transformed face]]; from that time onwards he must hide his face with a [[veil]]. Moses assembles the Hebrews and repeats to them the commandments he has received from God, which are to keep the [[Sabbath]] and to construct the Tabernacle. The Israelites do as they are commanded. From that time God dwells in the Tabernacle and orders the travels of the Hebrews.\n\n== Composition ==\n=== Authorship ===\nJewish and Christian tradition viewed [[Mosaic authorship|Moses as the author of Exodus]] and the entire [[Torah]], but by the end of the 19th century the increasing awareness of discrepancies, inconsistencies, repetitions and other features of the Pentateuch had led scholars to abandon this idea.{{sfn|Meyers|2005|p=16}} In approximate round dates, the process which produced Exodus and the Pentateuch probably began around 600 BCE when existing oral and written traditions were brought together to form books recognisable as those we know, reaching their final form as unchangeable sacred texts around 400 BCE.{{sfn|McEntire|2008|p=8}}\n\n=== Genre and sources ===\nThe story of [[the exodus]] is the [[founding myth]] of the Israelites, telling of their deliverance from slavery by [[Yahweh]] which made them his chosen people according to the [[Mosaic covenant]].{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}}  Fretheim says that it is not a historical narrative in any modern sense, instead its primary concern is theological.<ref name=\":0\">Fretheim, p. 8.</ref> It reflects common themes of past communities in exile, including facing foreign captivity and suffering under just judgment because of disloyalty to God.<ref name=\":0\" /> In Exodus, everything is presented as the work of God, who appears frequently in person.<ref>Houston, p. 68.</ref>\n\nAlthough mythical elements are not so prominent in Exodus as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], ancient legends may have an influence on the book's form or content: for example, the story of the infant Moses's salvation from the Nile is argued to be based on an earlier legend of king [[Sargon of Akkad]], while the story of the [[parting of the Red Sea]] may trade on Mesopotamian [[creation myth]]ology.  Similarly, the [[Covenant Code]] (the law code in Exodus 20:22\u201323:33) has some similarities in both content and structure with the [[Laws of Hammurabi]]. These influences serve to reinforce the conclusion that the Book of Exodus originated in the exiled Jewish community of 6th-century BCE [[Babylon]], but not all the sources are Mesopotamian: the story of Moses's flight to Midian following the murder of the Egyptian overseer may draw on the Egyptian ''[[Story of Sinuhe]]''.<ref>Kugler, Hartin, p. 74.</ref>\n\n== Themes ==\n[[File:David Roberts-IsraelitesLeavingEgypt 1828.jpg|thumb|300px|''Departure of the Israelites'' by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], 1829]]\n\n=== Salvation ===\nBiblical scholars describe the Bible's theologically-motivated history writing as \"[[salvation history]]\", meaning a history of God's saving actions that give identity to Israel \u2013 the promise of offspring and land to the ancestors, the exodus from Egypt (in which God saves Israel from slavery), the wilderness wandering, the revelation at Sinai, and the hope for the future life in the [[promised land]].<ref name=\"Dozeman\">Dozeman, p. 9.</ref>\n\n=== Theophany ===\nA [[theophany]] is a manifestation (appearance) of a god \u2013 in the Bible, an appearance of the God of Israel, accompanied by storms \u2013 the earth trembles, the mountains quake, the heavens pour rain, thunder peals and lightning flashes.<ref>Dozeman, p. 4.</ref> The theophany in Exodus begins \"the third day\" from their arrival at Sinai in chapter 19: Yahweh and the people meet at the mountain, God appears in the storm and converses with Moses, giving him the [[Ten Commandments]] while the people listen. The theophany is therefore a public experience of divine law.<ref>Dozeman, p. 427.</ref>\n\nThe second half of Exodus marks the point at which, and describes the process through which, God's theophany becomes a permanent presence for Israel via the [[Tabernacle]]. That so much of the book (chapters 25\u201331, 35\u201340) describes the plans of the Tabernacle demonstrates the importance it played in the perception of [[Second Temple Judaism]] at the time of the text's redaction by the Priestly writers: the Tabernacle is the place where God is physically present, where, through the priesthood, Israel could be in direct, literal communion with him.<ref>Dempster, p. 107.</ref>\n\n=== Covenant ===\nThe heart of Exodus is the [[Mosaic covenant|Sinaitic covenant]].<ref>Wenham, p. 29.</ref> A covenant is a legal document binding two parties to take on certain obligations towards each other.<ref>Meyers, p. 148.</ref> There are several covenants in the Bible, and in each case they exhibit at least some of the elements in real-life treaties of the ancient Middle East: a preamble, historical prologue, stipulations, deposition and reading, list of witnesses, blessings and curses, and ratification by animal sacrifice.<ref>Meyers, pp. 149\u2013150.</ref> Biblical covenants, in contrast to Eastern covenants in general, are between a god, Yahweh, and a people, Israel, instead of between a strong ruler and a weaker vassal.<ref>Meyers, p. 150.</ref>\n\n=== Election of Israel ===\nGod elects Israel for salvation because the \"sons of Israel\" are \"the firstborn son\" of the God of Israel, descended through Shem and Abraham to the chosen line of [[Jacob]] whose name is changed to Israel. The goal of the divine plan in Exodus is a return to humanity's state in [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], so that God can dwell with the Israelites as he had with [[Adam and Eve]] through the Ark and Tabernacle, which together form a model of the universe; in later [[Abrahamic religion]]s Israel becomes the guardian of God's plan for humanity, to bring \"God's creation blessing to mankind\" begun in Adam.<ref>Dempster, p. 100.</ref>\n\n== Weekly Torah portions ==\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 079.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Moses]] with the Ten Commandments, by [[Rembrandt]] (1659)]]\n{{main|Weekly Torah portion}}\n\n:*[[Shemot (parsha)|Shemot]], on Exodus 1\u20135: Affliction in Egypt, discovery of baby Moses, Pharaoh\n:*[[Va'eira (parsha)|Va'eira]], on Exodus 6\u20139: Plagues 1 to 7 of Egypt\n:*[[Bo (parsha)|Bo]], on Exodus 10\u201313: Last plagues of Egypt, first Passover\n:*[[Beshalach (parsha)|Beshalach]], on Exodus 13\u201317: Parting the Sea, water, manna, Amalek\n:*[[Yitro (parsha)|Yitro]], on Exodus 18\u201320: Jethro\u2019s advice, The Ten Commandments\n:*[[Mishpatim (parsha)|Mishpatim]], on Exodus 21\u201324: The Covenant Code\n:*[[Terumah (parsha)|Terumah]], on Exodus 25\u201327: God's instructions on the Tabernacle and furnishings\n:*[[Tetzaveh (parsha)|Tetzaveh]], on Exodus 27\u201330: God's instructions on the first priests\n:*[[Ki Tissa]], on Exodus 30\u201334: Census, anointing oil, golden calf, stone tablets, Moses radiant\n:*[[Vayakhel (parsha)|Vayakhel]], on Exodus 35\u201338: Israelites collect gifts, make the Tabernacle and furnishings\n:*[[Pekudei (parsha)|Pekudei]], on Exodus 38\u201340: Setting up and filling of The Tabernacle\n\n== Historicity ==\n{{multiple image | align. = left | width1 = 150\t| image1 = Exodus map.jpg | caption1 = 1585 map | width2 = 168\t| image2 = Wanderings in the desert map.jpg | caption2 = 1641 map | footer = Historical representations of the [[Stations of the Exodus]]}}\nThe overwhelming consensus among scholars is that the Exodus story is best understood as a [[myth]] and does not accurately describe historical events.{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=46}}  While archaeology has found traces left by even small bands of hunter-gatherers in the Sinai, there is no evidence at all for the large body of people described in the Exodus story: \"The conclusion \u2013 that Exodus did not happen at the time and in the manner described in the Bible \u2013 seems irrefutable [...] repeated excavations and surveys throughout the entire area have not provided even the slightest evidence\" (Finkelstein and Silberman, 2001).{{sfn|Finkelstein|Silberman|2001|p=63}} Instead, modern archaeology suggests continuity between Canaanite and Israelite settlement, indicating a primarily Canaanite origin for Israel.{{sfn|Barmash|2015|p=4}}{{sfn|Shaw|2002|p=313}}\n\nWhile all but the most conservative scholars reject the biblical account of the Exodus,{{sfn|Collins|2005|p=46}} a majority still believes that the story has some historical basis,{{sfn|Faust|2015|p=476}}{{sfn|Redmount|2001|p=87}} with Kenton Sparks referring to it as \"mythologized history.\"{{sfn|Sparks|2010|p=73}} Some scholars, associated with the interpretative school of [[Biblical minimalism]],{{sfn|Davies|2004|p=23-24}} show more skepticism towards ascribing any [[historicity]] to the Exodus,{{sfn|Moore|Kelle|2011|p=95}} with some arguing that the myth has its origins in the [[Babylonian exile|exilic]] and post-exilic Jewish community and has little to no historical basis.{{sfn|Russell|2009|pp=11-14}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Bible}}\n* [[List of films based on the Bible#Moses and the 40 years in the desert|Film adaptations of the Book of Exodus]]\n* [[History of the Jews in Egypt#Ancient times|History of the Jews in Ancient Egypt]]\n* [[Ketef Hinnom]]\n* [[Song of the sea]]\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book\n| last           = Barmash\n| first          = Pamela\n| chapter        = Out of the Mists of History: The Exaltation of the Exodus in the Bible\n| editor1-last   = Barmash\n| editor1-first  = Pamela\n| editor2-last   = Nelson\n| editor2-first  = W.
