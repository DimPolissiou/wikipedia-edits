It is also the seat of the [[Birkenfeld (Verbandsgemeinde)|like-named ''Verbandsgemeinde'']].\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\nThe town lies in the [[Nahe (Rhine)|Nahegebiet]] (Nahe area), to the north of the namesake river, on the edge of the ''Naturpark Saar-Hunsr\u00fcck''. Birkenfeld lies roughly 13&nbsp;km southwest of [[Idar-Oberstein]] and 12&nbsp;km northwest of [[Baumholder]].\n\n===Neighbouring municipalities===\nClockwise from the north, these are [[Gollenberg, Rhineland-Palatinate|Gollenberg]], [[Elchweiler]], [[Schmi\u00dfberg]], [[Rimsberg]], [[Dienstweiler]], [[Ellweiler]], [[Dambach, Germany|Dambach]], [[Br\u00fccken, Birkenfeld|Br\u00fccken]], [[Buhlenberg]] and [[Ellenberg, Rhineland-Palatinate|Ellenberg]].\n\n==History==\nThe name Birkenfeld has its origin in an old German dialect, [[Old Frankish]]. It means something rather like \u201cat the field with the birches\u201d (it is directly [[cognate]] with the [[English language|English]] words \u201cbirch field\u201d). From the name's Frankish roots it can be inferred that today's town arose on a spot where there was quite a noticeable stand of [[birch]] trees sometime about the year AD 500, and that it was founded by [[Franks|Frankish]]-German farmers. To this day, there are a great number of birch trees in the bird conservation area at the clay quarries.\n\nThe first attestation of the name is spelled ''Bikenuelt'' (about 700) or ''Birkinvelt'' at the time when it had a documentary mention from Archbishop of [[Trier]] [[Egbert (Archbishop of Trier)|Egbert]] in 981. From this document comes knowledge that Saint [[Leudwinus]] (Archbishop of Trier 695-713) had donated to the [[St. Paulinus' Church, Trier|St. Paulinus' Abbey]] in Trier the churches at Birkenfeld and Brombach.\n\n[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] finds from the [[Iron Age]], however, bear witness to quite heavy settlement even in the 8th century BC. In the 1st century BC, [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] legions overran the area, and for 400 years, it lay under Roman rule. This is known mainly from finds made in the town's immediate vicinity. The town that is now Birkenfeld lies right on a [[Roman roads|Roman road]] that served as a crosslink between two important military roads, namely the [[Metz]]-[[Mainz]] road to the south and the Trier-[[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]-Mainz road to the north, which was mentioned by Roman poet [[Ausonius]] in his ''Mosella'' in AD 350, and which also corresponds along some stretches with the ''Hunsr\u00fcckh\u00f6henstra\u00dfe'' (\u201cHunsr\u00fcck Heights Road\u201d, a scenic road across the [[Hunsr\u00fcck]] built originally as a military road on [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]\u2019s orders). This crosslink, also known as the ''Bronzestra\u00dfe'' (\u201cBronze Road\u201d), linked the [[Glan (Nahe)|Glan]], [[Nohen]] and the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] with each other. The ''Bronzestra\u00dfe'' crossed the Nahe in Nohen (''villa Aldena'') and ran farther on, right through the Wasserschieder Wald, a state forest that still stands today on the town's outskirts, by way of [[Gollenberg, Rhineland-Palatinate|Gollenberg]], by [[B\u00f6rfink]] and on towards Trier.\n\nThe Frankish settlement of ''Birkinvelt'' was held in the 13th century by the [[County of Sponheim|Counts of Sponheim]]. In 1223, the County was split into the \u201cFront\u201d and \u201cRear\u201d Counties of Sponheim, and Birkenfeld passed to the latter, and was then held by the counts whose seat was at the Starkenburg ([[castle]], now a ruin) near [[Traben-Trarbach|Trarbach]]. In 1293, Castle Birkenfeld had its first documentary mention. In 1332, Birkenfeld was granted town rights by Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis the Bavarian]].\n\nAfter the last Count of Sponheim died in 1437, the \u201cRear\u201d County was inherited by the [[Margrave]]s of [[Baden]] and the [[County of Veldenz|Counts of Veldenz]]. In 1584, a [[House of Wittelsbach]] sideline, in the person of [[Charles I, Count Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken-Birkenfeld]], resided in town. In this same year, expansion work also began on the castle to turn it into a princely residence in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style. Exactly 140 years later, the last remnants of the Princely holding of court at Schloss Birkenfeld, as it had come to be known, were swept away. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648), the town itself became in 1635 a theatre of war. Also that year, the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] broke out in Birkenfeld and claimed 416 lives.\n\nIn 1776, under Margrave [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|Karl Friedrich]], Birkenfeld became seat of the Badish ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Oberamt]]''. In this time, Birkenfeld blossomed. The town experienced an economic and cultural upswing. In 1779, for instance, the first \u201cHigher School\u201d was founded. In [[Napoleon I|Napoleon's]] time, in 1798, the [[Rhine]]\u2019s left bank was [[Cession|ceded]] to [[France]], whereafter Birkenfeld belonged to the [[Departments of France|Department]] of [[Sarre (department)|Sarre]].\n\nOne night in February 1797, Johannes B\u00fcckler, known as [[Schinderhannes]], [[Burglary|burgled]] a cloth factory owned by the Brothers Stumm, who would later become [[coal]] and [[steel]] entrepreneurs on the Saar. A large part of the cloth stolen during this break-in Schinderhannes sold to a [[fence (criminal)|fence]] in Hundheim<!-- Bell-Hundheim or Morbach-Hundheim? -->.<ref>Peter Bayerlein: Schinderhannes-Ortslexikon, S. 38, Mainz-Kostheim 2003</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814-1815), the Principality of Birkenfeld was awarded to the [[Duchy of Oldenburg|Grand Duchy of Oldenburg]] in 1817 for the contribution of [[Peter I, Grand Duke of Oldenburg|Peter I]], then regent of Oldenburg, to the military effort against Napoleon. Under Oldenburg rule, the new palatial castle, which is now the district administration\u2019s seat, was built in 1821. Not only was this built, but so were further buildings in the Governmental Quarter (''Regierungsviertel''), such as the infantry barracks (until 1963, a [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] building, now the local office for the regulation of expenditures caused by stationed forces), which to this day characterize the town\u2019s appearance with their [[Classicism|Classicist]] style from Oldenburg times.\n\nIn the time of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], the town became on 1 April 1937 part of the [[Prussia]]n district of Birkenfeld, which was formed out of the former Oldenburg holdings and the ''Restkreis'' (roughly \u201cremnant district\u201d) of the former exclave of Saxe-Coburg from 1814 to 1834, St. Wendel-Baumholder (this designation as a ''Restkreis'' had arisen from its being what had been left of the Sankt Wendel district on the Prussian side of the border once the Territory of the Saar Basin had been formed under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]). After the [[Second World War]], Birkenfeld belonged to the French zone of occupation, and since 1946, it has been a district seat in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]].\n\n==Religion==\nIn 2008, 50% of the town's inhabitants were [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical]] and 31% were [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].<ref>[http://www.kommwis.de/uploads/media/Online-Gemeindestatistik_02.htm KommWis, Stand: 31.

Indeed, he was acclaimed in the office in 1968 with a great majority for another 12 years, but by 1970, he had to give up his professional office when, under administrative restructuring in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], towns with fewer than 7,500 inhabitants were merged into ''Verbandsgemeinden''.\n\nThe following have served as mayor of Birkenfeld:\n* Eugen Ruppenthal from 1923 to 1933 and from 1949 to 1953\n* Oswald Morenz from 1953 to 1961\n* Werner K\u00e4ufer from 1961 to 1970\n* Erich M\u00f6rsdorf from 1971 to 1990\n* Manfred Dreier from 1990 to 2000, (SPD)\n* Peter Nauert from 2000 until 2014 (CDU)\n* Miroslaw Kowalski since 2014, (CDU)\n\n===Coat of arms===\nThe town's [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Azure on a mount vert a birch tree with roots proper surmounted by an inescutcheon chequy gules and argent.\n\nThe main [[charge (heraldry)|charge]], the [[birch]] tree, is [[Canting arms|canting]] for the town's name (\u201cbirch\u201d is ''Birke'' in [[German language|German]]). The [[inescutcheon]] with the red and silver \u201cchequy\u201d pattern is the coat of arms formerly borne by the \u201cHinder\u201d [[County of Sponheim]], thus bearing witness to that time in the town's history. This composition is based on an old court seal from 1577.\n\nThe arms have been borne since 29 October 1923, when they were approved by the Ministry of the Interior at [[Oldenburg]].\n\n===Town partnerships===\nBirkenfeld fosters partnerships with the following places:\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Roerdalen]], [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], [[Netherlands]]\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Ch\u00e2teau-Salins]], [[Moselle]], [[France]]\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n\n===Lambdacism in the local dialect===\nIn bygone days, the local Birkenfeld dialect was marked by the peculiarity of often replacing the sounds /d/ and /t/ \u2013 and sometimes /r/ as well \u2013 with /l/, a [[Sound change|shift]] known as [[Wiktionary:lambdacism|lambdacism]]. For example, a Birkenfelder in those days would have said ''Fulerlale'' where Standard High German would have ''Futterladen'' (\u201cfodder shop\u201d). A full-sentence example can be seen in a remark made by the Birkenfeld sexton \u201cFuchs Karl\u201d to the church councillor and parish priest Haag: ''Jo, jo, Herr Kirjerot, pririje kann e jela, awa noch lang net loule!'', or in Standard High German, ''Ja, ja, Herr Kirchenrat, predigen kann ein jeder, aber noch lange nicht l\u00e4uten!'' (\u201cYes, yes, Mr. Church Councillor, preaching is something anyone can do, but bellringing, not for long\u201d).\n\nLambdacism, though, long ago vanished from the Birkenfeld dialect, having given way to the other shift that is customary in [[Hunsr\u00fcckisch]]: [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]].\n\n===Museums===\nThe ''Landesmuseum des Vereins f\u00fcr Heimatkunde im Landkreis Birkenfeld'' (\u201cState Museum of the Association for Local History in the Rural District of Birkenfeld\u201d) offers an overview of 2,500 years of cultural history. The centrepiece is the interactively equipped Celtic experience exhibit ''Kelten, Kunst und Kult erleben'' (\u201cExperience [[Celts]], [[Art]] and [[Worship]]\u201d). Here, through reconstructions, archaeological finds and replicas, these people's life is presented. Further exhibits deal with regional and territorial history of the ''Birkenfelder Land''. Historical highlights among these exhibits are the [[High Middle Ages]] (13th to 15th centuries) and Oldenburg times in the Principality of Birkenfeld beginning in the early 19th century. Regularly changing exhibits deal with both historical and current themes.\n\n===Buildings===\nThe following are listed buildings or sites in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]\u2019s Directory of Cultural Monuments:<ref>[http://denkmallisten.gdke-rlp.de/Birkenfeld.pdf Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district]</ref>\n[[File:Birkenfeld-nahe-torhaus.jpg|thumb|Castle Birkenfeld\u2019s gatehouse]]\n[[File:Birkenfeld-nahe-alte-schule.jpg|thumb|The Old School on Kirchplatz]]\n[[File:Birkenfeld-nahe-jugendherberge.jpg|thumb|The former youth hostel;

The house, built in 1883 in the bourgeois Classicist style, is where the painter Hugo Zang (1858\u20131946) once lived. In 2006, restoration work began in an effort to bring the house up to a standard worthy of monumental protection. Since 2008, the building has housed not only the Birkenfeld district [[folk high school]] but also seven gallery rooms for changing exhibitions of works by local and national artists.\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\n\n===Economy===\nThe town's economy is characterized mainly by small and midsize businesses. Owing to Birkenfeld's history as a noble residence town and an administrative seat, no great industrial development ever took place here. The biggest employers, besides the administrative bodies, are thus a foundation and the [[Bundeswehr]].\n\nThe [[German Red Cross]]\u2019s (DRK) ''Elisabeth-Stiftung'', a medical rehabilitation foundation, with its [[hospital]], ''Berufsf\u00f6rderungswerk Birkenfeld'' (an institute for retraining workers whose condition precludes their return to former occupations), private vocational schools, measures for youth and senior citizens\u2019 home is with more than 600 employees the town's biggest employer. Following the ''Elisabeth-Stiftung'' is the Bundeswehr (among other units, the 2nd [[Luftwaffe]] Division) with more than 500 military and civilian personnel. The ''Stefan-Morsch-Stiftung'', a foundation for keeping data on potential [[bone marrow]] and [[stem cell]] donors, has its seat in Birkenfeld.\n\nOn the lands of the former [[railway station]], a centre for [[Startup company|starting up]] businesses (\u201cBIG-Center\u201d) was built in the 1990s.\n\n===Transport===\n\n====Road====\nBirkenfeld has good road links to ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n'' 41 (east-west, between [[Mainz]] and [[Saarbr\u00fccken]]) and 269 (between [[Bernkastel-Kues]] and [[Saarlouis]]), as well as to [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 62|A&nbsp;62]], which is the most important north-south link, running between [[Trier]] and [[Kaiserslautern]]. Furthermore, ''Bundesstra\u00dfe'' 269 links to the ''Hunsr\u00fcckh\u00f6henstra\u00dfe'', and thereby to [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]], which lies 50&nbsp;km away by road. This journey is covered five times each day by a bus service.\n\n====Rail====\nBirkenfeld's rail link is 5&nbsp;km away in nearby [[Hoppst\u00e4dten-Weiersbach|Neubr\u00fccke]], which has a station on the [[Nahe Valley Railway]] ([[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]\u2013[[Saarbr\u00fccken]]). Saarbr\u00fccken can be reached by train in 45 minutes, and [[Frankfurt]] in less than two hours. The former [[Birkenfeld Railway|spur line leading to Birkenfeld]] has been abandoned, and is now a cycle path.\n\n====Hiking trails====\nRunning outwards from Birkenfeld are five local loop trails for [[hiking]] with a total length through the region of more than 60&nbsp;km. These are the ''Glockenweg'' (roughly 16&nbsp;km), the ''Eulenweg'' (roughly 9&nbsp;km), the ''Mausweg'' (roughly 12.5&nbsp;km), the ''M\u00fchlenweg'' (roughly 12.5&nbsp;km) and the ''Rehweg'' (roughly 12.5&nbsp;km). The long-distance Nahe-H\u00f6henweg and the Sironaweg, which leads by many [[Celts|Celtic]]-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Archaeology|archaeological]] finds, likewise run by Birkenfeld.\n\n====Cycle paths====\nThe roughly 120&nbsp;km-long ''Nahe-Radweg'' and the ''Rheinland-Pfalz-Route'' run right through the middle of town. They are supplemented by three local cycling circuits, R1, R2 and R3, with a total length of just under 80&nbsp;km.\n\n===Public institutions===\n\n====Education====\nSince 1996, a [[vocational school]] has been established on the grounds of a former [[United States|US]] military hospital in the neighbouring municipality of [[Hoppst\u00e4dten-Weiersbach]]. The [[Environmental Campus Birkenfeld]] (''Umwelt-Campus Birkenfeld'') has, as a branch of the [[Trier University of Applied Sciences]], made a significant contribution to the Birkenfeld region's economic development.\n\nFor school-age children there is a broad array of offerings. \n* [[Primary school]]\n* [[Realschule#The .22Advanced Realschule.22 and .22Realschule Plus.22|Realschule plus]]\n* [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] Birkenfeld\n* F\u00f6rderschule Schwerpunkt Lernen ([[special school]] with focus on learning)\n\nEnjoying more than local importance is the ''Elisabeth-Stiftung'' medical rehabilitation foundation, with its specific offers of qualifications to people with either physical or mental handicaps. Alumni come from all over Germany and even from neighbouring countries.\n\nAmong other academic offerings is the ''Volkshochschule Birkenfeld'', a [[folk high school]].\n\n====Authorities====\nBirkenfeld is the location of a number of authorities:\n* District administration\n* ''Verbandsgemeinde'' administration\n* ''Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit'' (Federal [[employment agency]])\n* Land surveying office\n* [[Police department]]\n* Forester's office\n\n===Sport and leisure===\nBirkenfeld has, among other sport and leisure facilities, a heated outdoor [[swimming pool]], the ''Stadion am Berg'' (\u201c[[Stadium]] at the Mountain\u201d), several sport halls, a [[zoo]], two libraries, a vocational library and the youth centre. In 2000, a [[skatepark]] was built at the youth centre, which in 2005 was expanded with a [[funbox]], a [[quarter pipe]], a ramp and an obstacle.\n\n==Notable residents==\n\n===Sons and daughters of the town===\n[[File:Warth-trauernde-birkenfeld.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Trauernde'' at the Birkenfeld graveyard.

Birkenfeld lies roughly 13&nbsp;km southwest of [[Idar-Oberstein]] and 12&nbsp;km northwest of [[Baumholder]].\n\n===Neighbouring municipalities===\nClockwise from the north, these are [[Gollenberg, Rhineland-Palatinate|Gollenberg]], [[Elchweiler]], [[Schmi\u00dfberg]], [[Rimsberg]], [[Dienstweiler]], [[Ellweiler]], [[Dambach, Germany|Dambach]], [[Br\u00fccken, Birkenfeld|Br\u00fccken]], [[Buhlenberg]] and [[Ellenberg, Rhineland-Palatinate|Ellenberg]].\n\n==History==\nThe name Birkenfeld has its origin in an old German dialect, [[Old Frankish]]. It means something rather like \u201cat the field with the birches\u201d (it is directly [[cognate]] with the [[English language|English]] words \u201cbirch field\u201d). From the name's Frankish roots it can be inferred that today's town arose on a spot where there was quite a noticeable stand of [[birch]] trees sometime about the year AD 500, and that it was founded by [[Franks|Frankish]]-German farmers. To this day, there are a great number of birch trees in the bird conservation area at the clay quarries.\n\nThe first attestation of the name is spelled ''Bikenuelt'' (about 700) or ''Birkinvelt'' at the time when it had a documentary mention from Archbishop of [[Trier]] [[Egbert (Archbishop of Trier)|Egbert]] in 981. From this document comes knowledge that Saint [[Leudwinus]] (Archbishop of Trier 695-713) had donated to the [[St. Paulinus' Church, Trier|St. Paulinus' Abbey]] in Trier the churches at Birkenfeld and Brombach.\n\n[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] finds from the [[Iron Age]], however, bear witness to quite heavy settlement even in the 8th century BC. In the 1st century BC, [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] legions overran the area, and for 400 years, it lay under Roman rule. This is known mainly from finds made in the town's immediate vicinity. The town that is now Birkenfeld lies right on a [[Roman roads|Roman road]] that served as a crosslink between two important military roads, namely the [[Metz]]-[[Mainz]] road to the south and the Trier-[[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]-Mainz road to the north, which was mentioned by Roman poet [[Ausonius]] in his ''Mosella'' in AD 350, and which also corresponds along some stretches with the ''Hunsr\u00fcckh\u00f6henstra\u00dfe'' (\u201cHunsr\u00fcck Heights Road\u201d, a scenic road across the [[Hunsr\u00fcck]] built originally as a military road on [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]]\u2019s orders). This crosslink, also known as the ''Bronzestra\u00dfe'' (\u201cBronze Road\u201d), linked the [[Glan (Nahe)|Glan]], [[Nohen]] and the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] with each other. The ''Bronzestra\u00dfe'' crossed the Nahe in Nohen (''villa Aldena'') and ran farther on, right through the Wasserschieder Wald, a state forest that still stands today on the town's outskirts, by way of [[Gollenberg, Rhineland-Palatinate|Gollenberg]], by [[B\u00f6rfink]] and on towards Trier.\n\nThe Frankish settlement of ''Birkinvelt'' was held in the 13th century by the [[County of Sponheim|Counts of Sponheim]]. In 1223, the County was split into the \u201cFront\u201d and \u201cRear\u201d Counties of Sponheim, and Birkenfeld passed to the latter, and was then held by the counts whose seat was at the Starkenburg ([[castle]], now a ruin) near [[Traben-Trarbach|Trarbach]]. In 1293, Castle Birkenfeld had its first documentary mention. In 1332, Birkenfeld was granted town rights by Emperor [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis the Bavarian]].\n\nAfter the last Count of Sponheim died in 1437, the \u201cRear\u201d County was inherited by the [[Margrave]]s of [[Baden]] and the [[County of Veldenz|Counts of Veldenz]]. In 1584, a [[House of Wittelsbach]] sideline, in the person of [[Charles I, Count Palatine of Zweibr\u00fccken-Birkenfeld]], resided in town. In this same year, expansion work also began on the castle to turn it into a princely residence in the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] style. Exactly 140 years later, the last remnants of the Princely holding of court at Schloss Birkenfeld, as it had come to be known, were swept away. During the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648), the town itself became in 1635 a theatre of war. Also that year, the [[Plague (disease)|Plague]] broke out in Birkenfeld and claimed 416 lives.\n\nIn 1776, under Margrave [[Charles Frederick, Grand Duke of Baden|Karl Friedrich]], Birkenfeld became seat of the Badish ''[[Amt (country subdivision)|Oberamt]]''. In this time, Birkenfeld blossomed. The town experienced an economic and cultural upswing. In 1779, for instance, the first \u201cHigher School\u201d was founded. In [[Napoleon I|Napoleon's]] time, in 1798, the [[Rhine]]\u2019s left bank was [[Cession|ceded]] to [[France]], whereafter Birkenfeld belonged to the [[Departments of France|Department]] of [[Sarre (department)|Sarre]].\n\nOne night in February 1797, Johannes B\u00fcckler, known as [[Schinderhannes]], [[Burglary|burgled]] a cloth factory owned by the Brothers Stumm, who would later become [[coal]] and [[steel]] entrepreneurs on the Saar. A large part of the cloth stolen during this break-in Schinderhannes sold to a [[fence (criminal)|fence]] in Hundheim<!-- Bell-Hundheim or Morbach-Hundheim? -->.<ref>Peter Bayerlein: Schinderhannes-Ortslexikon, S. 38, Mainz-Kostheim 2003</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814-1815), the Principality of Birkenfeld was awarded to the [[Duchy of Oldenburg|Grand Duchy of Oldenburg]] in 1817 for the contribution of [[Peter I, Grand Duke of Oldenburg|Peter I]], then regent of Oldenburg, to the military effort against Napoleon. Under Oldenburg rule, the new palatial castle, which is now the district administration\u2019s seat, was built in 1821. Not only was this built, but so were further buildings in the Governmental Quarter (''Regierungsviertel''), such as the infantry barracks (until 1963, a [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] building, now the local office for the regulation of expenditures caused by stationed forces), which to this day characterize the town\u2019s appearance with their [[Classicism|Classicist]] style from Oldenburg times.\n\nIn the time of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], the town became on 1 April 1937 part of the [[Prussia]]n district of Birkenfeld, which was formed out of the former Oldenburg holdings and the ''Restkreis'' (roughly \u201cremnant district\u201d) of the former exclave of Saxe-Coburg from 1814 to 1834, St. Wendel-Baumholder (this designation as a ''Restkreis'' had arisen from its being what had been left of the Sankt Wendel district on the Prussian side of the border once the Territory of the Saar Basin had been formed under the terms of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]). After the [[Second World War]], Birkenfeld belonged to the French zone of occupation, and since 1946, it has been a district seat in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]].\n\n==Religion==\nIn 2008, 50% of the town's inhabitants were [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical]] and 31% were [[Catholic Church|Catholic]].<ref>[http://www.kommwis.de/uploads/media/Online-Gemeindestatistik_02.htm KommWis, Stand: 31.

Both his predecessors, Manfred Dreier and Erich M\u00f6rsdorf, headed both the town and the ''Verbandsgemeinde'' of Birkenfeld at once.\n\nWerner K\u00e4ufer was the last professional mayor of the town of Birkenfeld. Indeed, he was acclaimed in the office in 1968 with a great majority for another 12 years, but by 1970, he had to give up his professional office when, under administrative restructuring in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], towns with fewer than 7,500 inhabitants were merged into ''Verbandsgemeinden''.\n\nThe following have served as mayor of Birkenfeld:\n* Eugen Ruppenthal from 1923 to 1933 and from 1949 to 1953\n* Oswald Morenz from 1953 to 1961\n* Werner K\u00e4ufer from 1961 to 1970\n* Erich M\u00f6rsdorf from 1971 to 1990\n* Manfred Dreier from 1990 to 2000, (SPD)\n* Peter Nauert from 2000 until 2014 (CDU)\n* Miroslaw Kowalski since 2014, (CDU)\n\n===Coat of arms===\nThe town's [[Coat of arms|arms]] might be described thus: Azure on a mount vert a birch tree with roots proper surmounted by an inescutcheon chequy gules and argent.\n\nThe main [[charge (heraldry)|charge]], the [[birch]] tree, is [[Canting arms|canting]] for the town's name (\u201cbirch\u201d is ''Birke'' in [[German language|German]]). The [[inescutcheon]] with the red and silver \u201cchequy\u201d pattern is the coat of arms formerly borne by the \u201cHinder\u201d [[County of Sponheim]], thus bearing witness to that time in the town's history. This composition is based on an old court seal from 1577.\n\nThe arms have been borne since 29 October 1923, when they were approved by the Ministry of the Interior at [[Oldenburg]].\n\n===Town partnerships===\nBirkenfeld fosters partnerships with the following places:\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}} [[Roerdalen]], [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], [[Netherlands]]\n*{{flagicon|France}} [[Ch\u00e2teau-Salins]], [[Moselle]], [[France]]\n\n==Culture and sightseeing==\n\n===Lambdacism in the local dialect===\nIn bygone days, the local Birkenfeld dialect was marked by the peculiarity of often replacing the sounds /d/ and /t/ \u2013 and sometimes /r/ as well \u2013 with /l/, a [[Sound change|shift]] known as [[Wiktionary:lambdacism|lambdacism]]. For example, a Birkenfelder in those days would have said ''Fulerlale'' where Standard High German would have ''Futterladen'' (\u201cfodder shop\u201d). A full-sentence example can be seen in a remark made by the Birkenfeld sexton \u201cFuchs Karl\u201d to the church councillor and parish priest Haag: ''Jo, jo, Herr Kirjerot, pririje kann e jela, awa noch lang net loule!'', or in Standard High German, ''Ja, ja, Herr Kirchenrat, predigen kann ein jeder, aber noch lange nicht l\u00e4uten!'' (\u201cYes, yes, Mr. Church Councillor, preaching is something anyone can do, but bellringing, not for long\u201d).\n\nLambdacism, though, long ago vanished from the Birkenfeld dialect, having given way to the other shift that is customary in [[Hunsr\u00fcckisch]]: [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]].\n\n===Museums===\nThe ''Landesmuseum des Vereins f\u00fcr Heimatkunde im Landkreis Birkenfeld'' (\u201cState Museum of the Association for Local History in the Rural District of Birkenfeld\u201d) offers an overview of 2,500 years of cultural history. The centrepiece is the interactively equipped Celtic experience exhibit ''Kelten, Kunst und Kult erleben'' (\u201cExperience [[Celts]], [[Art]] and [[Worship]]\u201d). Here, through reconstructions, archaeological finds and replicas, these people's life is presented. Further exhibits deal with regional and territorial history of the ''Birkenfelder Land''. Historical highlights among these exhibits are the [[High Middle Ages]] (13th to 15th centuries) and Oldenburg times in the Principality of Birkenfeld beginning in the early 19th century. Regularly changing exhibits deal with both historical and current themes.\n\n===Buildings===\nThe following are listed buildings or sites in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]\u2019s Directory of Cultural Monuments:<ref>[http://denkmallisten.gdke-rlp.de/Birkenfeld.pdf Directory of Cultural Monuments in Birkenfeld district]</ref>\n[[File:Birkenfeld-nahe-torhaus.jpg|thumb|Castle Birkenfeld\u2019s gatehouse]]\n[[File:Birkenfeld-nahe-alte-schule.jpg|thumb|The Old School on Kirchplatz]]\n[[File:Birkenfeld-nahe-jugendherberge.jpg|thumb|The former youth hostel;

The house, built in 1883 in the bourgeois Classicist style, is where the painter Hugo Zang (1858\u20131946) once lived. In 2006, restoration work began in an effort to bring the house up to a standard worthy of monumental protection. Since 2008, the building has housed not only the Birkenfeld district [[folk high school]] but also seven gallery rooms for changing exhibitions of works by local and national artists.\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\n\n===Economy===\nThe town's economy is characterized mainly by small and midsize businesses. Owing to Birkenfeld's history as a noble residence town and an administrative seat, no great industrial development ever took place here. The biggest employers, besides the administrative bodies, are thus a foundation and the [[Bundeswehr]].\n\nThe [[German Red Cross]]\u2019s (DRK) ''Elisabeth-Stiftung'', a medical rehabilitation foundation, with its [[hospital]], ''Berufsf\u00f6rderungswerk Birkenfeld'' (an institute for retraining workers whose condition precludes their return to former occupations), private vocational schools, measures for youth and senior citizens\u2019 home is with more than 600 employees the town's biggest employer. Following the ''Elisabeth-Stiftung'' is the Bundeswehr (among other units, the 2nd [[Luftwaffe]] Division) with more than 500 military and civilian personnel. The ''Stefan-Morsch-Stiftung'', a foundation for keeping data on potential [[bone marrow]] and [[stem cell]] donors, has its seat in Birkenfeld.\n\nOn the lands of the former [[railway station]], a centre for [[Startup company|starting up]] businesses (\u201cBIG-Center\u201d) was built in the 1990s.\n\n===Transport===\n\n====Road====\nBirkenfeld has good road links to ''[[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n'' 41 (east-west, between [[Mainz]] and [[Saarbr\u00fccken]]) and 269 (between [[Bernkastel-Kues]] and [[Saarlouis]]), as well as to [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 62|A&nbsp;62]], which is the most important north-south link, running between [[Trier]] and [[Kaiserslautern]]. Furthermore, ''Bundesstra\u00dfe'' 269 links to the ''Hunsr\u00fcckh\u00f6henstra\u00dfe'', and thereby to [[Frankfurt-Hahn Airport]], which lies 50&nbsp;km away by road. This journey is covered five times each day by a bus service.\n\n====Rail====\nBirkenfeld's rail link is 5&nbsp;km away in nearby [[Hoppst\u00e4dten-Weiersbach|Neubr\u00fccke]], which has a station on the [[Nahe Valley Railway]] ([[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]]\u2013[[Saarbr\u00fccken]]). Saarbr\u00fccken can be reached by train in 45 minutes, and [[Frankfurt]] in less than two hours. The former [[Birkenfeld Railway|spur line leading to Birkenfeld]] has been abandoned, and is now a cycle path.\n\n====Hiking trails====\nRunning outwards from Birkenfeld are five local loop trails for [[hiking]] with a total length through the region of more than 60&nbsp;km. These are the ''Glockenweg'' (roughly 16&nbsp;km), the ''Eulenweg'' (roughly 9&nbsp;km), the ''Mausweg'' (roughly 12.5&nbsp;km), the ''M\u00fchlenweg'' (roughly 12.5&nbsp;km) and the ''Rehweg'' (roughly 12.5&nbsp;km). The long-distance Nahe-H\u00f6henweg and the Sironaweg, which leads by many [[Celts|Celtic]]-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[Archaeology|archaeological]] finds, likewise run by Birkenfeld.\n\n====Cycle paths====\nThe roughly 120&nbsp;km-long ''Nahe-Radweg'' and the ''Rheinland-Pfalz-Route'' run right through the middle of town. They are supplemented by three local cycling circuits, R1, R2 and R3, with a total length of just under 80&nbsp;km.\n\n===Public institutions===\n\n====Education====\nSince 1996, a [[vocational school]] has been established on the grounds of a former [[United States|US]] military hospital in the neighbouring municipality of [[Hoppst\u00e4dten-Weiersbach]]. The [[Environmental Campus Birkenfeld]] (''Umwelt-Campus Birkenfeld'') has, as a branch of the [[Trier University of Applied Sciences]], made a significant contribution to the Birkenfeld region's economic development.\n\nFor school-age children there is a broad array of offerings. \n* [[Primary school]]\n* [[Realschule#The .22Advanced Realschule.22 and .22Realschule Plus.22|Realschule plus]]\n* [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] Birkenfeld\n* F\u00f6rderschule Schwerpunkt Lernen ([[special school]] with focus on learning)\n\nEnjoying more than local importance is the ''Elisabeth-Stiftung'' medical rehabilitation foundation, with its specific offers of qualifications to people with either physical or mental handicaps. Alumni come from all over Germany and even from neighbouring countries.\n\nAmong other academic offerings is the ''Volkshochschule Birkenfeld'', a [[folk high school]].\n\n====Authorities====\nBirkenfeld is the location of a number of authorities:\n* District administration\n* ''Verbandsgemeinde'' administration\n* ''Bundesagentur f\u00fcr Arbeit'' (Federal [[employment agency]])\n* Land surveying office\n* [[Police department]]\n* Forester's office\n\n===Sport and leisure===\nBirkenfeld has, among other sport and leisure facilities, a heated outdoor [[swimming pool]], the ''Stadion am Berg'' (\u201c[[Stadium]] at the Mountain\u201d), several sport halls, a [[zoo]], two libraries, a vocational library and the youth centre. In 2000, a [[skatepark]] was built at the youth centre, which in 2005 was expanded with a [[funbox]], a [[quarter pipe]], a ramp and an obstacle.\n\n==Notable residents==\n\n===Sons and daughters of the town===\n[[File:Warth-trauernde-birkenfeld.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Trauernde'' at the Birkenfeld graveyard.
