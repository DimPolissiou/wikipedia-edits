A [[Smash Hits Radio|digital radio station]] was also available but closed on 5 August 2013.\n\n== Overview ==\n''Smash Hits'' featured the lyrics of latest hits and interviews with big names in music. It was initially published monthly, then went fortnightly. The style of the magazine was initially serious, but from around the mid-1980s onwards became one of ever-increasing irreverence. Its interviewing technique was novel at the time and, rather than looking up to the big names, it often made fun of them, asking strange questions rather than talking about their music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/aug/06/how-we-made-smash-hits-magazine|title=How we made Smash Hits magazine|last=Simpson|first=Dave|date=2018-08-06|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://metro.co.uk/2016/08/17/12-reasons-smash-hits-was-the-best-music-magazine-ever-6057584/|title=12 reasons Smash Hits was the best music magazine ever|date=2016-08-17|work=Metro|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nCreated by journalist Nick Logan, the title was launched in 1978 and appeared monthly for its first few months. He based the idea on a songwords magazine that his sister used to buy, but which was of poor quality.

The publisher was Emap, which was a small-time publisher based in [[Peterborough]] and the magazine was originally titled ''Disco Fever'', before they settled on ''Smash Hits''.<ref name=takethat>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/can-smash-hits-survive-the-end-of-take-that-1319556.html|title=Can 'Smash Hits' survive the end of Take That?|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n''Smash Hits'' launched the career of many journalists including [[Radio Times]] editor [[Mark Frith]]. Other well-known writers have included [[Dave Rimmer]], [[Mark Ellen]] (who went on to launch ''[[Q magazine|Q]]'', ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' and ''[[The Word (magazine)|Word]]''), [[Steve Beebee]], [[Chris Heath]], [[Tom Hibbert]] and [[Miranda Sawyer]]. [[Neil Tennant]] of the [[Pet Shop Boys]] also worked as a writer and assistant editor, and once claimed that had he not become a pop star, he would likely have pursued his ambition to become editor.\n\nThe magazine was also available in Continental Europe, especially in Germany where the issues could be bought at train stations or airports, whilst the title was licensed for a French version in the 1990s. There were other licensed versions in the magazine's history. In 1984, an Australian version was created and proved just as successful for that new market as the original had back in Britain, whilst in the United States, a version was published during the 1980s under the title ''[[Star Hits]]'', drawing articles from the British version.\n\nIt was published by [[Emap]], who also use the name for one of their [[digital television]] services, and for a [[digital radio]] station. The brand also covered the annual ''[[Smash Hits Poll Winners Party]]'', an awards ceremony voted for by readers of the magazine.\n\nThe magazine's sales peaked during the late 1980s. In the early part of the decade it was regularly selling 500,000 copies per issue, which had risen to over one million by 1989. Sales began to drop during the 1990s and by 1996 it was reported that sales were dropping roughly 100,000 per year.<ref name=takethat/> By the time of its demise, it was down to 120,000.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4673136.stm|title=Smash Hits magazine closing down|date=2006-02-02|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n==Final years of publishing==\nIn the 1990s, the magazine's circulation slumped and it was overtaken by the [[BBC]]'s spin off magazine ''[[Top of the Pops (magazine)|Top of the Pops]]''.

From 1965 to 1995, they qualified to play in the [[NFL playoffs]] 14 times, but did not win another championship or play in the [[Super Bowl]] during that period.\n\nIn 1995, owner [[Art Modell]], who had purchased the Browns in 1961, announced plans to move the team to [[Baltimore]]. After threats of legal action from the city of Cleveland and fans, [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|a compromise]] was reached in early 1996 that allowed Modell to establish the [[Baltimore Ravens]] as a new franchise while retaining the contracts of all Browns personnel. The Browns' [[intellectual property]], including team name, logos, training facility, and history, were kept [[Trust law|in trust]] and the franchise was regarded by the NFL as suspended, with a new team to be established by 1999 either by [[expansion team|expansion]] or relocation.

The franchise has also been noted for a lack of stability with head coaches (10 full time and two interim since 1999), and [[quarterback]]s (30 different starters since 1999), along with the [[List of NFL franchise post-season droughts|longest active playoff drought]] in the NFL at 17 seasons.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hogan will be Browns' 28th starting quarterback since 1999 |url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/10/11/kevin-hogan-will-be-browns-28th-starting-quarterback-since-1999/ |author=Smith, Michael David |publisher=NBC Sports |date=October 11, 2017 |accessdate=October 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of the Cleveland Browns}}\n{{details|List of Cleveland Browns seasons}}\n\nThe history of the Cleveland Browns American football team began in 1944 when taxi-cab magnate Arthur B. \"Mickey\" McBride secured a Cleveland franchise in the newly formed [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC). [[Paul Brown]] was the team's namesake and first coach. The Browns began play in 1946 in the AAFC. The Browns won each of the league's four championship games before the league dissolved in 1949. The team then moved to the more established National Football League (NFL), where it continued to dominate. Between 1950 and 1955, Cleveland reached the NFL championship game every year, winning three times.\n\nMcBride and his partners sold the team to a group of Cleveland businessmen in 1953 for a then-unheard-of $600,000. Eight years later, the team was sold again, this time to a group led by New York advertising executive [[Art Modell]]. Modell fired Brown before the 1963 season, but the team continued to win behind running back [[Jim Brown]]. The Browns won the championship in 1964 and reached the title game the following season, losing to the Green Bay Packers.\n\nWhen the AFL and NFL merged before the 1970 season, Cleveland became part of the new American Football Conference (AFC). While the Browns made it back to the playoffs in 1971 and 1972, they fell into mediocrity through the mid-1970s. A revival of sorts took place in 1979 and 1980, when quarterback Brian Sipe engineered a series of last-minute wins and the Browns came to be called the \"Kardiac Kids\". Under Sipe, however, the Browns did not make it past the first round of the playoffs. Quarterback Bernie Kosar, whom the Browns drafted in 1985, led the team to three AFC Championship games in the late 1980s but lost each time to the [[Denver Broncos]]. \n\nIn 1995, Modell announced he was relocating the Browns to Baltimore, sowing a mix of outrage and bitterness among Cleveland's dedicated fan base. Negotiations and legal battles led to an agreement where Modell would be allowed to take his personnel to Baltimore as an expansion franchise, called the [[Baltimore Ravens]],<ref name=\"Modell deal details\">{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=How Compromise Built Cleveland a New Stadium|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/12/sports/pro-football-how-compromise-built-cleveland-a-new-stadium.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|accessdate=June 17, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68Um3PzfT?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/12/sports/pro-football-how-compromise-built-cleveland-a-new-stadium.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|archivedate=June 17, 2012|date=February 12, 1996|url-status=live}}</ref> but would leave Cleveland the Browns' colors, logos and heritage for a reactivated Browns franchise that would take the field no later than 1999.<ref name=\"Modell cleared to move\">{{cite news|last=Sandomir |first=Richard |title=N.F.L.

The Browns struggled throughout the 2000s and 2010s, posting a record of 95\u2013224\u20131 ({{winpct|95|224|1}}) since their 1999 return. The Browns have only posted two winning seasons and one playoff appearance ([[2002 Cleveland Browns season|2002]]) since returning to the NFL. The team's struggles have been magnified since 2012, when the Lerner family sold the team to businessman [[Jimmy Haslam]]. In six seasons under Haslam\u2019s ownership, the Browns went through four head coaches and four general managers, none of whom had found success. In 2016 and 2017 under head coach [[Hue Jackson]], the Browns went 1\u201331 ({{winpct|1|31}}) (including a winless 0\u201316 season in 2017), the worst two-year stretch in NFL history, and received the number one overall draft pick in both of those years.\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n{{Main|Cleveland Browns logos and uniforms}}\n\n===Logos===\nThe Browns are the only National Football League team without a helmet logo. The logoless helmet serves as the Browns' official logo.

While Art Modell did away with the Brownie Elf in the mid-1960s, believing it to be too childish, its use has been revived under the current ownership. The popularity of the Dawg Pound section at First Energy Stadium has led to a brown and orange dog being used for various Browns functions. But overall, the orange, logo-less helmet continues as the primary trademark of the Cleveland Browns.\n\nOn February 24, 2015, the team unveiled its new logos and word marks, the only differences being minor color changes to the helmet with the helmet design remaining largely as is.<ref name=\"NewBrownsLogos2015\"/><ref name=\"BrownsLogosSneakPeek\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Patra|first=Kevin|title=Cleveland Browns unveil new logos|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000473731/article/cleveland-browns-unveil-new-logos |publisher=[[National Football League]] |date=February 24, 2015 |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Uniforms===\nThe original designs of the jerseys, pants, and socks remained mostly the same, but the helmets went through many significant revisions throughout the years. The Browns uniforms saw their first massive change prior to the 2015 season.\n\n'''Jerseys:'''\n# Brown - brown (officially \"[[seal brown]]\") with orange colored numbers and writing, and an orange-white-orange stripe sequence on the sleeves.\n# White (away) - white with orange numbers and writing, with a brown-orange-brown stripe sequence.\n# Orange - orange with white numerals and writing, and a brown-white-brown stripe sequence.\n\n'''Pants:'''\n# Brown - brown pants with an orange-white-orange stripe sequence down two-thirds the length of the pants. The other third is the word \"BROWNS,\" written in orange.\n# White - white pants with a brown-orange-brown stripes. \"BROWNS\" is written in brown.\n# Orange - orange pants with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence. \"BROWNS\" is written in brown.\n\n'''Socks:'''\n# Solid brown.\n# Solid white.\n# Solid orange.\n\n'''Helmet:''' Solid white (1946\u20131949); solid white for day games and solid orange for night games (1950\u20131951); orange with a single white stripe (1952\u20131956); orange with a single white stripe and brown numerals on the sides (1957\u20131959); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence and brown numerals on the sides (1960); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence (1961\u20131995 and 1999\u2013present).\n\nOver the years, the Browns have had on-and-off periods of wearing white for their home games, particularly in the 1970s and 80s, as well as in the early 2000s after the team returned to the league. Until recently, when more NFL teams have started to wear white at home at least once a season, the Browns were the only non-[[subtropical]] team north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to wear white at home on a regular basis.\n\nSecondary numerals (called \"TV numbers\") first appeared on the jersey sleeves in 1961. Over the years, there have been minor revisions to the sleeve stripes, the first occurring in 1968 (brown jerseys worn in early season) and 1969 (white and brown jerseys) when stripes began to be silk screened onto the sleeves and separated from each other to prevent color bleeding. However, the basic five-stripe sequence has remained intact (with the exception of the 1984 season). A recent revision was the addition of the initials \"AL\" to honor team owner [[Al Lerner]] who died in 2002; this was removed in 2013 upon Jimmy Haslam assuming ownership of the team.\n\nOrange pants with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence were worn from 1975 to 1983 and become symbolic of the \"Kardiac Kids\" era. The orange pants were worn again occasionally in 2003 and 2004.\n\nOther than the helmet, the uniform was completely redesigned for the 1984 season. New striping patterns appeared on the white jerseys, brown jerseys and pants. Solid brown socks were worn with brown jerseys and solid orange socks were worn with white jerseys. Brown numerals on the white jerseys were outlined in orange. White numerals on the brown jerseys were double outlined in brown and orange. (Orange numerals double outlined in brown and white appeared briefly on the brown jerseys in one pre-season game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kFlAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v1YMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1066,2673152|title=Browns' Home Jerseys Will Be Modified|newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator|date=August 8, 1984|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}</ref>) However, this particular uniform set was not popular with the fans, and in 1985 the uniform was returned to a look similar to the original design. It remained that way until 1995.\n\nIn 1999, the expansion Browns adopted the traditional design with two exceptions: first, the TV numbers, previously on the sleeves, were moved to the shoulders; and second, the orange-brown-orange pants stripes were significantly widened.\n\nExperimentation with the uniform design began in 2002. An alternate orange jersey was introduced that season as the NFL encouraged teams to adopt a third jersey, and a major design change was made when solid brown socks appeared for the first time since 1984 and were used with white, brown and orange jerseys. Other than 1984, striped socks (matching the jersey stripes) had been a signature design element in the team's traditional uniform. The white striped socks appeared occasionally with the white jerseys in 2003\u20132005 and 2007.\n\nExperimentation continued in 2003 and 2004 when the traditional orange-brown-orange stripes on the white pants were replaced by two variations of a brown-orange-brown sequence, one in which the stripes were joined (worn with white jerseys) and the other in which they were separated by white (worn with brown jerseys). The joined sequence was used exclusively with both jerseys in 2005.

In addition, the team has had historical rivalries with the [[Indianapolis Colts]], [[Denver Broncos]], [[Buffalo Bills]], and [[Detroit Lions]].\n\nThe team's biggest rival in the AAFC was the [[San Francisco 49ers]], though this has cooled and in some cases turned into a friendly relationship, as the Browns now play in the AFC and the 49ers play in the NFC. Additionally, many 49ers personnel helped the Browns relaunch in 1999 as well as former team President [[Mike Holmgren]] having started his NFL career in San Francisco. Also, 49ers owners [[John York]] and [[Denise DeBartolo York]] reside in [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], {{convert|60|mi}} southeast of Cleveland. Former long-time veteran placekicker and fan favorite, [[Phil Dawson]], signed with the 49ers in 2014, along with backup quarterback [[Colt McCoy]].\n\n===Divisional rivalries===\n\n====Pittsburgh Steelers====\n{{main|Browns\u2013Steelers rivalry}}\n\nOften called the \"Turnpike Rivalry\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kdka.com/local/Steelers.Browns.rivalry.2.564970.html |title=Steelers To Take On Browns For First Place In The AFC North |publisher=Kdka.com |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130024350/http://kdka.com/local/Steelers.Browns.rivalry.2.564970.html |archive-date=November 30, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the Browns' biggest rival has long been the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Former Browns owner [[Art Modell]] scheduled home games against the Steelers on Saturday nights from 1964 to 1970 to help fuel the rivalry. The rivalry has also been fueled by the proximity of the two teams, number of championships both teams have won, players and personnel having played and/or coached for both sides, and personal bitterness. The teams have played twice annually since 1950, making it the oldest rivalry in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] and the fifth-oldest rivalry in the NFL. Though the Browns dominated this rivalry early in the series (winning the first eight meetings and posting a 31\u20139 record in the 1950s and 1960s), the Steelers went 15\u20135 in the 1970s and 34\u20136\u20131 since the Browns returned to the league in 1999. The Steelers have been particularly dominant in Pittsburgh, posting a 42\u20136 record when hosting the Browns since 1970, including to winning streaks of 16 games (1970\u201385, 2004-present).\n\nThe Steelers currently hold a 76\u201359\u20131 lead. The Browns and Steelers met in the [[NFL playoffs|playoffs]] in {{nfly|1994}} and {{nfly|2002}}, with the Steelers winning both meetings. Though the rivalry has cooled in Pittsburgh due to the Modell move as well as the Browns' poor play since 1999, the Steelers still remain the top rival for Cleveland.\n\n====Cincinnati Bengals====\n{{main|Bengals\u2013Browns rivalry}}\n\nOriginally conceived due to the personal animosity between [[Paul Brown]] and [[Art Modell]], the \"Battle of Ohio\" between the Browns and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] has been fueled by the sociocultural differences between [[Cincinnati]] and Cleveland, a shared history between the two teams, and similar team colors, as Brown used the exact shade of orange for the Bengals that he used for the Browns. (Though this has changed since then, as the Bengals now use a brighter shade of orange.) Modell, in fact, moved the Browns to the AFC after the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] in order to have a rivalry with the Bengals. The rivalry has also produced two of the eight highest-scoring games in NFL history. Cincinnati has the all-time edge 51\u201342. While the Bengals have a 27\u201315 edge since the Browns returned to the NFL in 1999, the Browns-Bengals series has been more competitive than the Browns' series with their other division rivals.\n\n====Baltimore Ravens====\n{{main|Browns\u2013Ravens rivalry}}\nCreated as a result of the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|Browns' relocation to Baltimore]], the rivalry between the Browns and [[Baltimore Ravens]] was more directed at Art Modell than the team itself, and is simply considered a divisional game in Baltimore. This matchup is more bitter for Cleveland than the others due to the fact that the draft picks for 1995 to 1998 resulted in the rosters that won the [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl]] for the Ravens in 2000. Had the Browns stayed in Cleveland, these teams (drafted by general manager [[Ozzie Newsome]]) might have given the Browns the title after a 35-year drought.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rav/|title=Baltimore Ravens Team Encyclopedia|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}</ref> This bitterness was compounded when the Ravens won their second [[Super Bowl XLVII|Super Bowl]] in 2012.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Linden|first=Andrew|date=2015|title=Blue-Collar Identity And the 'Culture of Losing': Cleveland and the 'Save Our Browns' Campaign|url=|journal=Journal of Sport History|volume=42|issue=3|pages=340\u2013360|via=JSTOR}}</ref> The Ravens lead the overall series 31\u201311. The two teams have not met in the playoffs.\n\n===Other rivalries===\n\n====Detroit Lions====\nThe [[Detroit Lions]] rivalry began in the 1950s, when the Browns and Lions played each other in four NFL championships. The Lions won three of those championships, while the Browns won one. This was arguably one of the NFL's best rivalries in the 1950s. Since the NFL-AFL merger of 1970, the teams have met much less frequently with the Browns' move to the AFC. From 2002 to 2014, the two teams played an annual preseason game known as the \"Great Lakes Classic\".<ref name=\"The Great Lakes Classic\">{{cite news|url=http://www.morningjournal.com/articles/2009/11/22/sports/mj1925578.txt|title=Great Lakes Classic has lacked luster since its beginning|date=November 22, 2009|accessdate=March 21, 2009|author=Schudel, Jeff|publisher=[[The Morning Journal]]}}</ref>\n\n====Buffalo Bills====\nThe Bills rivalry had its roots back to the days of the AAFC, when there was a [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|team from Buffalo with the same name]] in that league. The Browns and AAFC Bills played six games, including a league championship game, before the Browns were selected to merge into the NFL and the Bills left out. After the current incarnation of the Bills joined the NFL, the Browns and Bills have played each other from time to time. Though the Browns and Bills are in different AFC divisions, a mellow rivalry defined by mutual respect has since developed between the teams due to the similarities between Buffalo and Cleveland and shared misfortune between the teams. Despite this \"rivalry\" being known for ugly games, such as an 8-0 Browns win played in a blizzard in 2007 and a 6-3 Browns win in 2009 in which Browns quarterback [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] only completed 2 of 17 passes,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/browns-win-ugly-beat-buffalo-6-3/|title = Browns Win Ugly, Beat Buffalo 6-3|date = October 11, 2009|publisher = CBS News}}</ref> there have been some competitive moments between the Bills and Browns as well, such as a playoff game in 1990 and two games with playoff-implications in 2007 and 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2014/11/cleveland_browns_vs_buffalo_bi_8.html|title = Cleveland Browns vs. Buffalo Bills series has seen it all: A championship, a fired coach and blizzard|first = Tim|last = Warskinskey|work = [[The Plain Dealer]]|publisher = Cleveland.com|date = November 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Browns fans' respect for the Bills is partly due to Bills founding owner [[Ralph Wilson]] being one of only two NFL owners to vote against the decision to [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|move the original Browns team to Baltimore]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Leonard |title=OWNERS APPROVE MOVE OF NFL TEAM TO BALTIMORE |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1996/02/10/owners-approve-move-of-nfl-team-to-baltimore/62005513-0215-46f0-9236-2eefbaae9583/ |website=WashingtonPost.com |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=September 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Denver Broncos====\nThe Browns had a brief rivalry with the [[Denver Broncos]] that arose from three AFC Championship Games from 1986 to 1989. In the 1986 AFC Championship, quarterback John Elway led [[The Drive]] to secure a tie in the waning moments at Cleveland Municipal Stadium; the Broncos went on to win in 23\u201320 in overtime. One year later, the two teams met again in the [[1986\u201387 NFL playoffs|1987 AFC Championship game]] at Mile High Stadium. Denver took a 21\u20133 lead, but Browns' quarterback Bernie Kosar threw four touchdown passes to tie the game at 31\u201331 halfway through the 4th quarter. After a long drive, John Elway threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to running back Sammy Winder to give Denver a 38\u201331 lead. Cleveland advanced to Denver's 8-yard line with 1:12 left, but Broncos' safety Jeremiah Castille stripped Browns' running back Earnest Byner of the football at the 2-yard line\u2014a play that has been called [[The Fumble]] by Browns' fans. The Broncos recovered it, gave Cleveland an intentional safety, and went on to win 38\u201333. The two teams met yet again in the 1989 AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium, which the Broncos easily won by a score of 37\u201321.\n\n==Fan base==\nA 2006 study conducted by ''Bizjournal'' determined that Browns [[fan (person)|fans]] are the most loyal fans in the NFL.

From 1965 to 1995, they qualified to play in the [[NFL playoffs]] 14 times, but did not win another championship or play in the [[Super Bowl]] during that period.\n\nIn 1995, owner [[Art Modell]], who had purchased the Browns in 1961, announced plans to move the team to [[Baltimore]]. After threats of legal action from the city of Cleveland and fans, [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|a compromise]] was reached in early 1996 that allowed Modell to establish the [[Baltimore Ravens]] as a new franchise while retaining the contracts of all Browns personnel. The Browns' [[intellectual property]], including team name, logos, training facility, and history, were kept [[Trust law|in trust]] and the franchise was regarded by the NFL as suspended, with a new team to be established by 1999 either by [[expansion team|expansion]] or relocation.

The franchise has also been noted for a lack of stability with head coaches (10 full time and two interim since 1999), and [[quarterback]]s (30 different starters since 1999), along with the [[List of NFL franchise post-season droughts|longest active playoff drought]] in the NFL at 17 seasons.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hogan will be Browns' 28th starting quarterback since 1999 |url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2017/10/11/kevin-hogan-will-be-browns-28th-starting-quarterback-since-1999/ |author=Smith, Michael David |publisher=NBC Sports |date=October 11, 2017 |accessdate=October 11, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n{{Main|History of the Cleveland Browns}}\n{{details|List of Cleveland Browns seasons}}\n\nThe history of the Cleveland Browns American football team began in 1944 when taxi-cab magnate Arthur B. \"Mickey\" McBride secured a Cleveland franchise in the newly formed [[All-America Football Conference]] (AAFC). [[Paul Brown]] was the team's namesake and first coach. The Browns began play in 1946 in the AAFC. The Browns won each of the league's four championship games before the league dissolved in 1949. The team then moved to the more established National Football League (NFL), where it continued to dominate. Between 1950 and 1955, Cleveland reached the NFL championship game every year, winning three times.\n\nMcBride and his partners sold the team to a group of Cleveland businessmen in 1953 for a then-unheard-of $600,000. Eight years later, the team was sold again, this time to a group led by New York advertising executive [[Art Modell]]. Modell fired Brown before the 1963 season, but the team continued to win behind running back [[Jim Brown]]. The Browns won the championship in 1964 and reached the title game the following season, losing to the Green Bay Packers.\n\nWhen the AFL and NFL merged before the 1970 season, Cleveland became part of the new American Football Conference (AFC). While the Browns made it back to the playoffs in 1971 and 1972, they fell into mediocrity through the mid-1970s. A revival of sorts took place in 1979 and 1980, when quarterback Brian Sipe engineered a series of last-minute wins and the Browns came to be called the \"Kardiac Kids\". Under Sipe, however, the Browns did not make it past the first round of the playoffs. Quarterback Bernie Kosar, whom the Browns drafted in 1985, led the team to three AFC Championship games in the late 1980s but lost each time to the [[Denver Broncos]]. \n\nIn 1995, Modell announced he was relocating the Browns to Baltimore, sowing a mix of outrage and bitterness among Cleveland's dedicated fan base. Negotiations and legal battles led to an agreement where Modell would be allowed to take his personnel to Baltimore as an expansion franchise, called the [[Baltimore Ravens]],<ref name=\"Modell deal details\">{{cite news|last=Sandomir|first=Richard|title=How Compromise Built Cleveland a New Stadium|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/12/sports/pro-football-how-compromise-built-cleveland-a-new-stadium.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|accessdate=June 17, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68Um3PzfT?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/12/sports/pro-football-how-compromise-built-cleveland-a-new-stadium.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|archivedate=June 17, 2012|date=February 12, 1996|url-status=live}}</ref> but would leave Cleveland the Browns' colors, logos and heritage for a reactivated Browns franchise that would take the field no later than 1999.<ref name=\"Modell cleared to move\">{{cite news|last=Sandomir |first=Richard |title=N.F.L.

The Browns struggled throughout the 2000s and 2010s, posting a record of 95\u2013224\u20131 ({{winpct|95|224|1}}) since their 1999 return. The Browns have only posted two winning seasons and one playoff appearance ([[2002 Cleveland Browns season|2002]]) since returning to the NFL. The team's struggles have been magnified since 2012, when the Lerner family sold the team to businessman [[Jimmy Haslam]]. In six seasons under Haslam\u2019s ownership, the Browns went through four head coaches and four general managers, none of whom had found success. In 2016 and 2017 under head coach [[Hue Jackson]], the Browns went 1\u201331 ({{winpct|1|31}}) (including a winless 0\u201316 season in 2017), the worst two-year stretch in NFL history, and received the number one overall draft pick in both of those years.\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\n{{Main|Cleveland Browns logos and uniforms}}\n\n===Logos===\nThe Browns are the only National Football League team without a helmet logo. The logoless helmet serves as the Browns' official logo.

While Art Modell did away with the Brownie Elf in the mid-1960s, believing it to be too childish, its use has been revived under the current ownership. The popularity of the Dawg Pound section at First Energy Stadium has led to a brown and orange dog being used for various Browns functions. But overall, the orange, logo-less helmet continues as the primary trademark of the Cleveland Browns.\n\nOn February 24, 2015, the team unveiled its new logos and word marks, the only differences being minor color changes to the helmet with the helmet design remaining largely as is.<ref name=\"NewBrownsLogos2015\"/><ref name=\"BrownsLogosSneakPeek\"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Patra|first=Kevin|title=Cleveland Browns unveil new logos|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000473731/article/cleveland-browns-unveil-new-logos |publisher=[[National Football League]] |date=February 24, 2015 |accessdate=August 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Uniforms===\nThe original designs of the jerseys, pants, and socks remained mostly the same, but the helmets went through many significant revisions throughout the years. The Browns uniforms saw their first massive change prior to the 2015 season.\n\n'''Jerseys:'''\n# Brown - brown (officially \"[[seal brown]]\") with orange colored numbers and writing, and an orange-white-orange stripe sequence on the sleeves.\n# White (away) - white with orange numbers and writing, with a brown-orange-brown stripe sequence.\n# Orange - orange with white numerals and writing, and a brown-white-brown stripe sequence.\n\n'''Pants:'''\n# Brown - brown pants with an orange-white-orange stripe sequence down two-thirds the length of the pants. The other third is the word \"BROWNS,\" written in orange.\n# White - white pants with a brown-orange-brown stripes. \"BROWNS\" is written in brown.\n# Orange - orange pants with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence. \"BROWNS\" is written in brown.\n\n'''Socks:'''\n# Solid brown.\n# Solid white.\n# Solid orange.\n\n'''Helmet:''' Solid white (1946\u20131949); solid white for day games and solid orange for night games (1950\u20131951); orange with a single white stripe (1952\u20131956); orange with a single white stripe and brown numerals on the sides (1957\u20131959); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence and brown numerals on the sides (1960); orange with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence (1961\u20131995 and 1999\u2013present).\n\nOver the years, the Browns have had on-and-off periods of wearing white for their home games, particularly in the 1970s and 80s, as well as in the early 2000s after the team returned to the league. Until recently, when more NFL teams have started to wear white at home at least once a season, the Browns were the only non-[[subtropical]] team north of the [[Mason-Dixon line]] to wear white at home on a regular basis.\n\nSecondary numerals (called \"TV numbers\") first appeared on the jersey sleeves in 1961. Over the years, there have been minor revisions to the sleeve stripes, the first occurring in 1968 (brown jerseys worn in early season) and 1969 (white and brown jerseys) when stripes began to be silk screened onto the sleeves and separated from each other to prevent color bleeding. However, the basic five-stripe sequence has remained intact (with the exception of the 1984 season). A recent revision was the addition of the initials \"AL\" to honor team owner [[Al Lerner]] who died in 2002; this was removed in 2013 upon Jimmy Haslam assuming ownership of the team.\n\nOrange pants with a brown-white-brown stripe sequence were worn from 1975 to 1983 and become symbolic of the \"Kardiac Kids\" era. The orange pants were worn again occasionally in 2003 and 2004.\n\nOther than the helmet, the uniform was completely redesigned for the 1984 season. New striping patterns appeared on the white jerseys, brown jerseys and pants. Solid brown socks were worn with brown jerseys and solid orange socks were worn with white jerseys. Brown numerals on the white jerseys were outlined in orange. White numerals on the brown jerseys were double outlined in brown and orange. (Orange numerals double outlined in brown and white appeared briefly on the brown jerseys in one pre-season game.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kFlAAAAAIBAJ&sjid=v1YMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1066,2673152|title=Browns' Home Jerseys Will Be Modified|newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator|date=August 8, 1984|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}</ref>) However, this particular uniform set was not popular with the fans, and in 1985 the uniform was returned to a look similar to the original design. It remained that way until 1995.\n\nIn 1999, the expansion Browns adopted the traditional design with two exceptions: first, the TV numbers, previously on the sleeves, were moved to the shoulders; and second, the orange-brown-orange pants stripes were significantly widened.\n\nExperimentation with the uniform design began in 2002. An alternate orange jersey was introduced that season as the NFL encouraged teams to adopt a third jersey, and a major design change was made when solid brown socks appeared for the first time since 1984 and were used with white, brown and orange jerseys. Other than 1984, striped socks (matching the jersey stripes) had been a signature design element in the team's traditional uniform. The white striped socks appeared occasionally with the white jerseys in 2003\u20132005 and 2007.\n\nExperimentation continued in 2003 and 2004 when the traditional orange-brown-orange stripes on the white pants were replaced by two variations of a brown-orange-brown sequence, one in which the stripes were joined (worn with white jerseys) and the other in which they were separated by white (worn with brown jerseys). The joined sequence was used exclusively with both jerseys in 2005.

In addition, the team has had historical rivalries with the [[Indianapolis Colts]], [[Denver Broncos]], [[Buffalo Bills]], and [[Detroit Lions]].\n\nThe team's biggest rival in the AAFC was the [[San Francisco 49ers]], though this has cooled and in some cases turned into a friendly relationship, as the Browns now play in the AFC and the 49ers play in the NFC. Additionally, many 49ers personnel helped the Browns relaunch in 1999 as well as former team President [[Mike Holmgren]] having started his NFL career in San Francisco. Also, 49ers owners [[John York]] and [[Denise DeBartolo York]] reside in [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]], {{convert|60|mi}} southeast of Cleveland. Former long-time veteran placekicker and fan favorite, [[Phil Dawson]], signed with the 49ers in 2014, along with backup quarterback [[Colt McCoy]].\n\n===Divisional rivalries===\n\n====Pittsburgh Steelers====\n{{main|Browns\u2013Steelers rivalry}}\n\nOften called the \"Turnpike Rivalry\",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kdka.com/local/Steelers.Browns.rivalry.2.564970.html |title=Steelers To Take On Browns For First Place In The AFC North |publisher=Kdka.com |date=October 14, 2010 |accessdate=June 2, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071130024350/http://kdka.com/local/Steelers.Browns.rivalry.2.564970.html |archive-date=November 30, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the Browns' biggest rival has long been the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Former Browns owner [[Art Modell]] scheduled home games against the Steelers on Saturday nights from 1964 to 1970 to help fuel the rivalry. The rivalry has also been fueled by the proximity of the two teams, number of championships both teams have won, players and personnel having played and/or coached for both sides, and personal bitterness. The teams have played twice annually since 1950, making it the oldest rivalry in the [[American Football Conference|AFC]] and the fifth-oldest rivalry in the NFL. Though the Browns dominated this rivalry early in the series (winning the first eight meetings and posting a 31\u20139 record in the 1950s and 1960s), the Steelers went 15\u20135 in the 1970s and 34\u20136\u20131 since the Browns returned to the league in 1999. The Steelers have been particularly dominant in Pittsburgh, posting a 42\u20136 record when hosting the Browns since 1970, including to winning streaks of 16 games (1970\u201385, 2004-present).\n\nThe Steelers currently hold a 76\u201359\u20131 lead. The Browns and Steelers met in the [[NFL playoffs|playoffs]] in {{nfly|1994}} and {{nfly|2002}}, with the Steelers winning both meetings. Though the rivalry has cooled in Pittsburgh due to the Modell move as well as the Browns' poor play since 1999, the Steelers still remain the top rival for Cleveland.\n\n====Cincinnati Bengals====\n{{main|Bengals\u2013Browns rivalry}}\n\nOriginally conceived due to the personal animosity between [[Paul Brown]] and [[Art Modell]], the \"Battle of Ohio\" between the Browns and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] has been fueled by the sociocultural differences between [[Cincinnati]] and Cleveland, a shared history between the two teams, and similar team colors, as Brown used the exact shade of orange for the Bengals that he used for the Browns. (Though this has changed since then, as the Bengals now use a brighter shade of orange.) Modell, in fact, moved the Browns to the AFC after the [[AFL\u2013NFL merger]] in order to have a rivalry with the Bengals. The rivalry has also produced two of the eight highest-scoring games in NFL history. Cincinnati has the all-time edge 51\u201342. While the Bengals have a 27\u201315 edge since the Browns returned to the NFL in 1999, the Browns-Bengals series has been more competitive than the Browns' series with their other division rivals.\n\n====Baltimore Ravens====\n{{main|Browns\u2013Ravens rivalry}}\nCreated as a result of the [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|Browns' relocation to Baltimore]], the rivalry between the Browns and [[Baltimore Ravens]] was more directed at Art Modell than the team itself, and is simply considered a divisional game in Baltimore. This matchup is more bitter for Cleveland than the others due to the fact that the draft picks for 1995 to 1998 resulted in the rosters that won the [[Super Bowl XXXV|Super Bowl]] for the Ravens in 2000. Had the Browns stayed in Cleveland, these teams (drafted by general manager [[Ozzie Newsome]]) might have given the Browns the title after a 35-year drought.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rav/|title=Baltimore Ravens Team Encyclopedia|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}</ref> This bitterness was compounded when the Ravens won their second [[Super Bowl XLVII|Super Bowl]] in 2012.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Linden|first=Andrew|date=2015|title=Blue-Collar Identity And the 'Culture of Losing': Cleveland and the 'Save Our Browns' Campaign|url=|journal=Journal of Sport History|volume=42|issue=3|pages=340\u2013360|via=JSTOR}}</ref> The Ravens lead the overall series 31\u201311. The two teams have not met in the playoffs.\n\n===Other rivalries===\n\n====Detroit Lions====\nThe [[Detroit Lions]] rivalry began in the 1950s, when the Browns and Lions played each other in four NFL championships. The Lions won three of those championships, while the Browns won one. This was arguably one of the NFL's best rivalries in the 1950s. Since the NFL-AFL merger of 1970, the teams have met much less frequently with the Browns' move to the AFC. From 2002 to 2014, the two teams played an annual preseason game known as the \"Great Lakes Classic\".<ref name=\"The Great Lakes Classic\">{{cite news|url=http://www.morningjournal.com/articles/2009/11/22/sports/mj1925578.txt|title=Great Lakes Classic has lacked luster since its beginning|date=November 22, 2009|accessdate=March 21, 2009|author=Schudel, Jeff|publisher=[[The Morning Journal]]}}</ref>\n\n====Buffalo Bills====\nThe Bills rivalry had its roots back to the days of the AAFC, when there was a [[Buffalo Bills (AAFC)|team from Buffalo with the same name]] in that league. The Browns and AAFC Bills played six games, including a league championship game, before the Browns were selected to merge into the NFL and the Bills left out. After the current incarnation of the Bills joined the NFL, the Browns and Bills have played each other from time to time. Though the Browns and Bills are in different AFC divisions, a mellow rivalry defined by mutual respect has since developed between the teams due to the similarities between Buffalo and Cleveland and shared misfortune between the teams. Despite this \"rivalry\" being known for ugly games, such as an 8-0 Browns win played in a blizzard in 2007 and a 6-3 Browns win in 2009 in which Browns quarterback [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] only completed 2 of 17 passes,<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.cbsnews.com/news/browns-win-ugly-beat-buffalo-6-3/|title = Browns Win Ugly, Beat Buffalo 6-3|date = October 11, 2009|publisher = CBS News}}</ref> there have been some competitive moments between the Bills and Browns as well, such as a playoff game in 1990 and two games with playoff-implications in 2007 and 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url = http://www.cleveland.com/browns/index.ssf/2014/11/cleveland_browns_vs_buffalo_bi_8.html|title = Cleveland Browns vs. Buffalo Bills series has seen it all: A championship, a fired coach and blizzard|first = Tim|last = Warskinskey|work = [[The Plain Dealer]]|publisher = Cleveland.com|date = November 30, 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe Browns fans' respect for the Bills is partly due to Bills founding owner [[Ralph Wilson]] being one of only two NFL owners to vote against the decision to [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|move the original Browns team to Baltimore]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shapiro |first1=Leonard |title=OWNERS APPROVE MOVE OF NFL TEAM TO BALTIMORE |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1996/02/10/owners-approve-move-of-nfl-team-to-baltimore/62005513-0215-46f0-9236-2eefbaae9583/ |website=WashingtonPost.com |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=September 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Denver Broncos====\nThe Browns had a brief rivalry with the [[Denver Broncos]] that arose from three AFC Championship Games from 1986 to 1989. In the 1986 AFC Championship, quarterback John Elway led [[The Drive]] to secure a tie in the waning moments at Cleveland Municipal Stadium; the Broncos went on to win in 23\u201320 in overtime. One year later, the two teams met again in the [[1986\u201387 NFL playoffs|1987 AFC Championship game]] at Mile High Stadium. Denver took a 21\u20133 lead, but Browns' quarterback Bernie Kosar threw four touchdown passes to tie the game at 31\u201331 halfway through the 4th quarter. After a long drive, John Elway threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to running back Sammy Winder to give Denver a 38\u201331 lead. Cleveland advanced to Denver's 8-yard line with 1:12 left, but Broncos' safety Jeremiah Castille stripped Browns' running back Earnest Byner of the football at the 2-yard line\u2014a play that has been called [[The Fumble]] by Browns' fans. The Broncos recovered it, gave Cleveland an intentional safety, and went on to win 38\u201333. The two teams met yet again in the 1989 AFC Championship at Mile High Stadium, which the Broncos easily won by a score of 37\u201321.\n\n==Fan base==\nA 2006 study conducted by ''Bizjournal'' determined that Browns [[fan (person)|fans]] are the most loyal fans in the NFL.

Macedon remained an important and powerful kingdom during both [[Wars of the Diadochi]] and later the [[Punic wars]] with Rome. There were many clashes during the long struggle between the Macedonians and the Romans who tried to enter the basin of Eordea and promote it into mainland Greece, but also because the area was a focal point as a secondary road passed through it. Macedon remained a force to be reckoned with until the [[Battle of Pydna]] (22 June 168 BC), in which the Roman general [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]], ending the reign of the [[Antigonid dynasty]] over Macedonia.\n\n===Roman period===\nFor the period of Roman times we have a lot of information from historians referring to the region of Ptolemais and Eordaia. The Roman Egnatia highway, which was detached from the main artery after leaving the Straits of the Key, led to present-day Kozani and then, through the Sarantaporos Strait, to Thessaly.

Other than its highly lignite-rich reserves, Ptolemaida is a highly industrialized area. The four [[power plant]]s in this area produce 70% of Greece's electrical power, using the large local deposits of [[lignite]] as fuel. The plants are owned by the [[Public Power Corporation]] (DEI), the major employer in the city. The plant was inaugurated by the Prime minister of Greece at that time, [[Constantine Karamanlis]].

There were many clashes during the long struggle between the Macedonians and the Romans who tried to enter the basin of Eordea and promote it into mainland Greece, but also because the area was a focal point as a secondary road passed through it. Macedon remained a force to be reckoned with until the [[Battle of Pydna]] (22 June 168 BC), in which the Roman general [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus|Aemilius Paulus]] defeated King [[Perseus of Macedon]], ending the reign of the [[Antigonid dynasty]] over Macedonia.\n\n===Roman period===\nFor the period of Roman times we have a lot of information from historians referring to the region of Ptolemais and Eordaia. The Roman Egnatia highway, which was detached from the main artery after leaving the Straits of the Key, led to present-day Kozani and then, through the Sarantaporos Strait, to Thessaly. In 395, Ptolemaida and all of Macedonia became part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]]. \n\n===Byzantine period===\n{{main|Empire of Nicaea|Despotate of Epirus|Kingdom of Thessalonica|Battle of Pelagonia}}\n\nAt various times, Ptolemaida was part of the [[Latin Empire]], the [[Kingdom of Thessalonica]], the [[Empire of Nicaea]], and the [[Despotate of Epirus]].{{citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n===Ottoman period===\nDuring the Ottoman period, Ptolemaida was called Kay\u0131lar, and it had two parts: A\u015fa\u011f\u0131 Kay\u0131lar and Yukar\u0131 Kay\u0131lar.

After the establishment of the [[feudal]] [[system]] in 1397, many of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Nobility|noble]] families came over from Asia Minor; their descendants may be recognized among the [[Beys]] or [[Muslim]] [[landowners]] around Kay\u0131lar.<ref name=EB1911/> At the beginning of the 18th century, the [[Turkish people|Turkish population]] was quite considerable, but since that time until at least the early 20th century it continuously decreased.<ref name=EB1911/> A low birth rate, the exhaustion of the male population by [[military service]], and a large mortality from [[epidemic]]s brought about a decline which has lately been hastened by [[emigration]].<ref name=EB1911/> The Turkish rural population around Kay\u0131lar was mainly composed of [[Konariot]] shepherds.<ref name=EB1911/> In the late 19th and early 20th century, Ptolemaida was part of the [[Manastir Vilayet]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. \n\n===Modern period===\nPtolemaida was occupied by the Greek forces on 15 October 1912 during the [[First Balkan War]], and later incorporated into the Greece.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Ptolemaida library.jpg|thumb|The municipal library]]\n\nPtolemaida's football club is called \"[[Eordaikos]]\" ({{lang-el|\u0395\u03bf\u03c1\u03b4\u03b1\u03ca\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2}}). Other teams include [[AE Ptolemaidas]]. Ptolemaida has schools, [[lyceum]]s, [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasia]], churches, banks, a post office, a train station ([[Kozani]] - [[Florina]]), a police station, a water tower, and squares (''[[plateia]]''). There is the potential of a university being established by the state in the near future. The [[Anthropological and Folklore Museum (Ptolemaida)|Anthropological and Folklore Museum]] is based in the town.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Electric power plant of Ptolemaida - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Electric power plant of Ptolemaida]]\n[[File:Lignite mine in Ptolemaida.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Ptolemaida-Florina coal mine]]]]\n\nThe most important lignite deposits in Greece are located in the north of the country at Ptolemais-Amynteon and Florina (approximately 1.5 billion tonnes) which contribute around 80% of national production. Other than its highly lignite-rich reserves, Ptolemaida is a highly industrialized area. The four [[power plant]]s in this area produce 70% of Greece's electrical power, using the large local deposits of [[lignite]] as fuel. The plants are owned by the [[Public Power Corporation]] (DEI), the major employer in the city. The plant was inagurated by the Prime minister of Greece at that time, [[Constantine Karamanlis]]. The other two are in [[Amyntaio]] in [[Florina (regional unit)|Florina regional unit]] and in [[Agios Dimitrios, Kozani|Agios Dimitrios]].\n\n==Climate==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2011}}\n[[File:Askio (Siniatsiko) mountain - Ptolemaida, Kozani prefecture, Greece.png|thumb|Askio mountain near the city]]\n\nThe city, situated in the middle of the Eordaia plain of [[Western Macedonia]], has a [[humid continental]] climate. Summers can be hot with thunderstorms in unsettled spells, whereas winters are among the coldest in [[Greece]]. It was here that the absolute low temperature record of Greece was recorded ({{convert|-29.6|\u00b0C|0|abbr=on}} on 27 January 1963). It was also the lowest in Europe for 1963.\n\n==Demographics==\nThe current municipal unit of Ptolemaida is constituted by the city of Ptolemaida and 11 small communities. At the 2011 [[census]], the population of the city was 32,142 residents.

During an interview with Apple Music's Zane Lowe, DeLonge discussed the decision to donate all of the song's profits to the charity:<blockquote>\u201cI\u2019ve handed out food on holidays and for people in need. I\u2019ve gone to schools and handed out food to a lot of these kids only get their meals at school. And a lot of people think that the United States obviously is a more wealthy country than other, but there\u2019s still so much poverty here. As you know, you live in Los Angeles, and so you can see that there\u2019s a disparity between the classes. It was very simple for me to make one phone call and say, \u2018Why don\u2019t we do this? Because this is something that everybody needs right now. People can\u2019t take care of their families. Kids are not in schools where they\u2019re getting their only meal of the day.\u2019 It kind of worked out, and that\u2019s how you know it\u2019s meant to be. I\u2019m super proud to be with Feeding America on this.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/angels-and-airwaves-new-song-all-thats-left-is-love-985262/|title=Angels and Airwaves Unveil New Song 'All That's Left Is Love'|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|last2=Kreps|first2=Daniel|date=2020-04-16|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref></blockquote>The song was met with mostly positive feedback.
