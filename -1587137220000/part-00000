It was located on the [[Hanover Fairground]] (Messegel\u00e4nde Hannover), which is the largest exhibition ground in the world. Initially some 40 million people were expected to attend the exhibition over the course of months, however eventually with less than half of this number the Expo was a flop and turned out a financial failure.<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/wirtschaft/expo-flop-die-sponsoren-der-weltausstellung-werden-nervoes/154892.html|title=Expo-Flop: Die Sponsoren der Weltausstellung werden nerv\u00f6s|language=de|author1=Antje Sirleschtov|author2=Imre Grimm|date=21 July 2000|newspaper=Der Tagesspiegel|trans-title=Expo-Flop: The Sponsors of the World Exhibition are getting Nervous}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/revisiting-hanover-10-years-after-expo-2000/a-5510543|title=Revisiting Hanover 10 years after Expo 2000|publisher=Deutsche Welle|author=Hilke Janssen|editor= Rob Mudge|date=28 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite thesis|url=https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/1697|title=Explicating Failure: Expo 2000|last=Jones|first=Zachary Mark|type=Bachelor of Architecture|date=May 2011|publisher=Penn State University}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2000/05/27/world-class-failure/0c583971-b070-423f-b3f0-c0878f95299d/|title=World-Class Failure|first1=Benjamin|last1=Forgey|first2=Benjamin|last2=Forgey|date=27 May 2000|newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000601&slug=4024011|title=Is German Expo a failure even before it gets started?|author=Carol J.

In 1992, the architects Studio Arnaboldi/Cavadini of Locarno won an international design competition for the masterplan of the exhibition grounds. On 12 June that year, a survey conducted by the city council was made public showing only 51.5% of area residents supported hosting the expo.\n\n===Construction===\nOn 5 May 1994 a new company was created by the government in Bonn, '''Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung und Durchf\u00fchrung der Weltausstellung EXPO 2000 in Hannover''' (EXPO 2000 Hannover GmbH). Headed by chairman Helmut Werner, the company was responsible for the construction and management of the Expo.\n\nIn 1995 the supervisory board agreed on the concept for the thematics of the Expo. Construction finally began on 22 April 1996.\n\nUnlike previous expos, which focused on present advances in science and technology, EXPO 2000 focused more on developing and presenting solutions for the future.\n\n===World Expo 2000===\nThe Expo opened to the public on Thursday 1 June 2000 and ran for five months, ending on Tuesday 31 October.\n\nThe Expo site was situated on the original 1,000,000 square meters of the [[Hanover fairground]]; an additional 600,000 m\u00b2 was also made available as a newly opened section to the grounds. As a visitor walked in and tickets were taken, looking above to the approximately four-story-high ceiling, a visitor would have noticed the huge circular pods that held large TVs showing animated people greeting the visitors and providing tourist information in different languages. Some ten large [[McDonald's]] restaurants were also built, along with restaurants representing several of the exhibitor countries. Small retail locations were also set up to supply Expo merchandise. The [[United States]] reversed its decision to take part at a relatively late stage, and the area set aside for the American pavilion was left undeveloped.\n\n40,000,000 visitors were expected at Expo 2000, but only 25,210,000 people came to see the event.  This led to a financial deficit of about $600,000,000.  With pre-ordered tickets priced at 69 DM, the Expo seemed expensive compared to other days out.  Commentator Georg Giersberg wrote in the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]'' that entrance fees for Germany's 53 main theme parks cost on average less than half the price of the Expo (about 30 DM).  Other financial shortfalls came from a lack of corporate sponsorship, since it cost US$4.8 million to be an official product supplier or US$14.5 million to become a world partner.\n\nPart of the failure of the Expo was a lack of clear perception of what to expect at Expo 2000, not helped by a \"cerebral\" advertising campaign that had failed to explain what the Expo was for.  In a 2000 ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' article, a Berlin-based marketing firm, [[Scholz & Friends]], stated that \"the organizers have failed to convey to the public a clear image of what Expo 2000 is going to be: an entertainment park, a blown-up museum, or a nature reserve.\" <!-- Is this a translation back from a German translation of the original article? It sounds funny to me!--> In the same article, Ralf Strobach, secretary of ''Hanover's Citizens' Initiative for Environment Protection'', said that \"For a long time, companies were unsure if they would be putting money in an eco-show or a showcase for their latest inventions.\" Only after the Expo was open and clearly not meeting expectations was a new advertising campaign created, aimed at the domestic market with British actor [[Peter Ustinov]] and German television star [[Verona Pooth|Verona Feldbusch]] and stressing the fun side of the Expo, under the slogan ''\"Das gibt's nur einmal, es kommt nie wieder\"'' (\"This only happens once, it's never coming back\").\n\nThe German band [[Kraftwerk]] created a [[Vocoder|vocoded]] speech signature theme, \"[[Expo 2000 (song)|Expo 2000]]\", which was also developed into a single of the same name. Later, a remix single \"Expo Remix\" was released. The band was also paid US$190,000 for a five-second jingle, leading Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] to state that he \"wouldn't have spent so much money\".\n\n== Settlement ==\nThe western slope of [[Kronsberg]] emerged in the late 1990s in conjunction with the EXPO 2000, established an environmental point of settlement at the Hannover Expo. The district is a result of independent evolutionary history and unique structure often perceived as a separate district.\n\n==Pavilions==\n\n===Themed===\n\n*The 21st Century\n*Planet of Visions\n*Human\n*Knowledge\n*Mobility\n*Communication\n*Energy\n*Health\n*Nutrition\n*Environment\n*Basic Needs\n*Future of Labour\n\n===National===\n{{external links|section|date=April 2016}}\nIn total, 155 nations took part.

Four-storey twin buildings measuring 50 x 7.5&nbsp;m each were clad in heat-treated thermowood.  The two buildings were connected by bridges, allowing visitors to move amongst the three exhibit halls on the first two stories.  A 15&nbsp;m wide birch forest was also created.\n*{{flagicon|Germany}}'''Germany'''&nbsp;\u2013 Designed by architect Wund Gruppe, the 24,000 m\u00b2 building was the largest nation pavilion at Expo.\n*{{flagicon|Japan}}'''Japan'''&nbsp;\u2013 The Japanese Pavilion was a [[gridshell]] structure made out of recycled paper tubes that created a honeycomb-like building. The German authorities refused to allow a paper-only structure, literally held together at the joints by tape, so a secondary supporting structure made of wood was created to obtain the needed legal approval. Designed by architect [[Shigeru Ban]] along with consultants [[Frei Otto]] (the German architect who created the [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)]] and the German pavilion at [[Expo 67]] in Montreal), [[Buro Happold]] (the British engineering firm which created the [[Millennium Dome]]) and Stefan Polonyi (a structural engineering professor), the building took 3 weeks to assemble and covered an exhibit area of 72&nbsp;m (long) x 35&nbsp;m (wide) x 15.5&nbsp;m (high), pavilion lot size: 5,450 m\u00b2 and building surface area: 3,600 m\u00b2.\n*{{flagicon|Latvia}}'''Latvia'''&nbsp;\u2013 about 300,000 people participated<ref name=\"Latvia\">{{cite web|url=https://zime.center/?r=0&action=zime-category&category=expo2000&language=en-GB|title=ZIME|accessdate=20 April 2016}}</ref> in the \"Zime\" project created by [[Armands Strazds]] and [[Modris Tenisons]].{{cn|date=April 2016}}\n*{{flagicon|Lithuania|1988}}'''Lithuania'''&nbsp;\u2013 The pavilion was designed by Marina and Audrius Bu\u010das, Gintaras Kuginys, Valdas Ozarinskas and Aida \u010ceponyt\u0117.

The pavilion was designed by the architect Adiya Baldandorj Bayud, to show the [[Yurt|ger]] residences of Great [[Khan (title)|Khans]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] of the 13th century. The feature of this town was that it created the town with ger, ger-carriage and various kinds of cotton residents, which are different in forms, sizes and applications, used by Mongolians of that century. Moreover, the King\u2019s privilege armchair, clothing and accessories of ancient heroes and weapons were shown in the \"Chingis's Town\".http://mongolwall.com/mw_wp/\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}}'''Netherlands''' was located at '3' Europa Boulevard, and the Dutch pavilion was one of the most popular buildings, winning international acclaim, and was designed by the firm [[MVRDV]]. The theme of the 36&nbsp;m high building (the Expo's tallest structure) was \"Holland creates Space\". Six Holland eco-system landscapes were stacked to showcase how a country can make the most out of a small space. Guests entered on the ground floor and moved through the exhibit space via grand exterior staircases that wrapped around the building. The top level contained a small lake surrounded with windmills that generated power for the building. The interior spaces were designed by MET Studio. The original plan was to dismantle the building and move it back to Amsterdam, but it was determined that it would be much cheaper to just create a new building from scratch. As of 2006, the building sits empty and is partially looted with windows smashed and garbage everywhere.

Designed by the French architect [[Alain Durand-Heriot]], the exhibit tried to evoke the feeling of being in the Arab state. The main attraction was a 360\u00b0 circular cinema. The building was 84&nbsp;m \u00d7 36&nbsp;m and built out of recyclable materials. The theme of the pavilion was \"From the traditional to the modern\" and presented the history of the country.\n*{{flagicon|Venezuela|1954}}'''Venezuela'''&nbsp;\u2013 The [[pavilion]] was a convertible tent structure which opened and closed like a flower. It was very lightweight, was constructed with no waste and completely re-usable. The flower petals were positioned according to the weather, to shade, keep dry or allow sun to shine on the pavilion. It was designed by [[Fruto Vivas]] and [[Frei Otto]] with [[Mahmoud Bodo Rasch|SL Rasch]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tensinet.com/database/viewProject/4003|title=Expo 2000 (Hannover): Venezuelan Pavilion|accessdate=5 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130805082055/http://www.tensinet.com/database/viewProject/4003|archive-date=5 August 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Other===\n*'''Planet m \u2013 Media for Mankind'''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history.bertelsmann.com/en/milestones/view/84 |title=Bertelsmann website|accessdate=2018-04-18}}</ref>&nbsp;\u2013 The [[Bertelsmann]] pavilion, designed by [[TRIAD Berlin]], explored the importance of the media. Guests were brought to the exhibition by the world's largest elevator, which could transport up to 200 people at once.

The BMW 750hL Clean Energy car was on display. There were also exhibits on the possibilities of solar- and water-fueled cars. Daimler Chrysler also operated '''Lab.01''', an interactive laboratory showcasing mobility devices including mini-robots.\n*'''EU European Union'''&nbsp;\u2013 The pavilion presented the European Union's vision of Europe. The walk-through exhibit was divided into seven zones: 50's, Time Shuttle, Euro, Blue Planet, Bridge, Tunnel, Here and Now.

Each initiative was shown in a flight case and featured text, images, and in many cases, contemporary handicraft. The exhibit was the first opportunity for indigenous people to represent themselves at a World Expo.\n*'''WWF''' ([[World Wildlife Fund]])&nbsp;\u2013 Pavilion\n*'''The ZERI Pavilion'''&nbsp;\u2013 The largest bamboo structure designed by Simon Velez, was built by 41 Colombian wood workers in less than three months. Over 4,500 bamboos (''Guadua angustifolia'') were joined to become the first building which dances with the rhythm of the earth&nbsp;\u2014 and this with a German building permit. Nine months of intensive scientific research and testing first enabled the acquisition of a temporary permit, and after the building was constructed twice (once in Manizales, Colombia and once in Hanover), the final permit was granted the day before the opening of the Expo 2000. This pavilion presented seven projects from around the world which demonstrated that it is possible to respond to everyone's needs on Earth with what we have. The projects from Colombia, Zimbabwe, Fiji, Sweden and Japan inspired many young people. The pavilion nearly went bankrupt when sales and attendance were so low, but thanks to a single bamboo in the center of the pavilion, enough money was collected to make it to the end. The ZERI Pavilion had an estimated 6.4 million visitors, but it had no doors and no queues.

It was located on the [[Hanover Fairground]] (Messegel\u00e4nde Hannover), which is the largest exhibition ground in the world. Initially some 40 million people were expected to attend the exhibition over the course of months, however eventually with less than half of this number the Expo was a flop and turned out a financial failure.<ref>{{cite newspaper|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/wirtschaft/expo-flop-die-sponsoren-der-weltausstellung-werden-nervoes/154892.html|title=Expo-Flop: Die Sponsoren der Weltausstellung werden nerv\u00f6s|language=de|author1=Antje Sirleschtov|author2=Imre Grimm|date=21 July 2000|newspaper=Der Tagesspiegel|trans-title=Expo-Flop: The Sponsors of the World Exhibition are getting Nervous}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.com/en/revisiting-hanover-10-years-after-expo-2000/a-5510543|title=Revisiting Hanover 10 years after Expo 2000|publisher=Deutsche Welle|author=Hilke Janssen|editor= Rob Mudge|date=28 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite thesis|url=https://honors.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/1697|title=Explicating Failure: Expo 2000|last=Jones|first=Zachary Mark|type=Bachelor of Architecture|date=May 2011|publisher=Penn State University}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2000/05/27/world-class-failure/0c583971-b070-423f-b3f0-c0878f95299d/|title=World-Class Failure|first1=Benjamin|last1=Forgey|first2=Benjamin|last2=Forgey|date=27 May 2000|newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite newspaper|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000601&slug=4024011|title=Is German Expo a failure even before it gets started?|author=Carol J.

In 1992, the architects Studio Arnaboldi/Cavadini of Locarno won an international design competition for the masterplan of the exhibition grounds. On 12 June that year, a survey conducted by the city council was made public showing only 51.5% of area residents supported hosting the expo.\n\n===Construction===\nOn 5 May 1994 a new company was created by the government in Bonn, '''Gesellschaft zur Vorbereitung und Durchf\u00fchrung der Weltausstellung EXPO 2000 in Hannover''' (EXPO 2000 Hannover GmbH). Headed by chairman Helmut Werner, the company was responsible for the construction and management of the Expo.\n\nIn 1995 the supervisory board agreed on the concept for the thematics of the Expo. Construction finally began on 22 April 1996.\n\nUnlike previous expos, which focused on present advances in science and technology, EXPO 2000 focused more on developing and presenting solutions for the future.\n\n===World Expo 2000===\nThe Expo opened to the public on Thursday 1 June 2000 and ran for five months, ending on Tuesday 31 October.\n\nThe Expo site was situated on the original 1,000,000 square meters of the [[Hanover fairground]]; an additional 600,000 m\u00b2 was also made available as a newly opened section to the grounds. As a visitor walked in and tickets were taken, looking above to the approximately four-story-high ceiling, a visitor would have noticed the huge circular pods that held large TVs showing animated people greeting the visitors and providing tourist information in different languages. Some ten large [[McDonald's]] restaurants were also built, along with restaurants representing several of the exhibitor countries. Small retail locations were also set up to supply Expo merchandise. The [[United States]] reversed its decision to take part at a relatively late stage, and the area set aside for the American pavilion was left undeveloped.\n\n40,000,000 visitors were expected at Expo 2000, but only 25,210,000 people came to see the event.  This led to a financial deficit of about $600,000,000.  With pre-ordered tickets priced at 69 DM, the Expo seemed expensive compared to other days out.  Commentator Georg Giersberg wrote in the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]'' that entrance fees for Germany's 53 main theme parks cost on average less than half the price of the Expo (about 30 DM).  Other financial shortfalls came from a lack of corporate sponsorship, since it cost US$4.8 million to be an official product supplier or US$14.5 million to become a world partner.\n\nPart of the failure of the Expo was a lack of clear perception of what to expect at Expo 2000, not helped by a \"cerebral\" advertising campaign that had failed to explain what the Expo was for.  In a 2000 ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'' article, a Berlin-based marketing firm, [[Scholz & Friends]], stated that \"the organizers have failed to convey to the public a clear image of what Expo 2000 is going to be: an entertainment park, a blown-up museum, or a nature reserve.\" <!-- Is this a translation back from a German translation of the original article? It sounds funny to me!--> In the same article, Ralf Strobach, secretary of ''Hanover's Citizens' Initiative for Environment Protection'', said that \"For a long time, companies were unsure if they would be putting money in an eco-show or a showcase for their latest inventions.\" Only after the Expo was open and clearly not meeting expectations was a new advertising campaign created, aimed at the domestic market with British actor [[Peter Ustinov]] and German television star [[Verona Pooth|Verona Feldbusch]] and stressing the fun side of the Expo, under the slogan ''\"Das gibt's nur einmal, es kommt nie wieder\"'' (\"This only happens once, it's never coming back\").\n\nThe German band [[Kraftwerk]] created a [[Vocoder|vocoded]] speech signature theme, \"[[Expo 2000 (song)|Expo 2000]]\", which was also developed into a single of the same name. Later, a remix single \"Expo Remix\" was released. The band was also paid US$190,000 for a five-second jingle, leading Chancellor [[Gerhard Schr\u00f6der]] to state that he \"wouldn't have spent so much money\".\n\n== Settlement ==\nThe western slope of [[Kronsberg]] emerged in the late 1990s in conjunction with the EXPO 2000, established an environmental point of settlement at the Hannover Expo. The district is a result of independent evolutionary history and unique structure often perceived as a separate district.\n\n==Pavilions==\n\n===Themed===\n\n*The 21st Century\n*Planet of Visions\n*Human\n*Knowledge\n*Mobility\n*Communication\n*Energy\n*Health\n*Nutrition\n*Environment\n*Basic Needs\n*Future of Labour\n\n===National===\n{{external links|section|date=April 2016}}\nIn total, 155 nations took part.

Four-storey twin buildings measuring 50 x 7.5&nbsp;m each were clad in heat-treated thermowood.  The two buildings were connected by bridges, allowing visitors to move amongst the three exhibit halls on the first two stories.  A 15&nbsp;m wide birch forest was also created.\n*{{flagicon|Germany}}'''Germany'''&nbsp;\u2013 Designed by architect Wund Gruppe, the 24,000 m\u00b2 building was the largest nation pavilion at Expo.\n*{{flagicon|Japan}}'''Japan'''&nbsp;\u2013 The Japanese Pavilion was a [[gridshell]] structure made out of recycled paper tubes that created a honeycomb-like building. The German authorities refused to allow a paper-only structure, literally held together at the joints by tape, so a secondary supporting structure made of wood was created to obtain the needed legal approval. Designed by architect [[Shigeru Ban]] along with consultants [[Frei Otto]] (the German architect who created the [[Olympic Stadium (Munich)]] and the German pavilion at [[Expo 67]] in Montreal), [[Buro Happold]] (the British engineering firm which created the [[Millennium Dome]]) and Stefan Polonyi (a structural engineering professor), the building took 3 weeks to assemble and covered an exhibit area of 72&nbsp;m (long) x 35&nbsp;m (wide) x 15.5&nbsp;m (high), pavilion lot size: 5,450 m\u00b2 and building surface area: 3,600 m\u00b2.\n*{{flagicon|Latvia}}'''Latvia'''&nbsp;\u2013 about 300,000 people participated<ref name=\"Latvia\">{{cite web|url=https://zime.center/?r=0&action=zime-category&category=expo2000&language=en-GB|title=ZIME|accessdate=20 April 2016}}</ref> in the \"Zime\" project created by [[Armands Strazds]] and [[Modris Tenisons]].{{cn|date=April 2016}}\n*{{flagicon|Lithuania|1988}}'''Lithuania'''&nbsp;\u2013 The pavilion was designed by Marina and Audrius Bu\u010das, Gintaras Kuginys, Valdas Ozarinskas and Aida \u010ceponyt\u0117.

The pavilion was designed by the architect Adiya Baldandorj Bayud, to show the [[Yurt|ger]] residences of Great [[Khan (title)|Khans]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] of the 13th century. The feature of this town was that it created the town with ger, ger-carriage and various kinds of cotton residents, which are different in forms, sizes and applications, used by Mongolians of that century. Moreover, the King\u2019s privilege armchair, clothing and accessories of ancient heroes and weapons were shown in the \"Chingis's Town\".http://mongolwall.com/mw_wp/\n*{{flagicon|Netherlands}}'''Netherlands''' was located at '3' Europa Boulevard, and the Dutch pavilion was one of the most popular buildings, winning international acclaim, and was designed by the firm [[MVRDV]]. The theme of the 36&nbsp;m high building (the Expo's tallest structure) was \"Holland creates Space\". Six Holland eco-system landscapes were stacked to showcase how a country can make the most out of a small space. Guests entered on the ground floor and moved through the exhibit space via grand exterior staircases that wrapped around the building. The top level contained a small lake surrounded with windmills that generated power for the building. The interior spaces were designed by MET Studio. The original plan was to dismantle the building and move it back to Amsterdam, but it was determined that it would be much cheaper to just create a new building from scratch. As of 2006, the building sits empty and is partially looted with windows smashed and garbage everywhere.

The building was 84&nbsp;m \u00d7 36&nbsp;m and built out of recyclable materials. The theme of the pavilion was \"From the traditional to the modern\" and presented the history of the country.\n*{{flagicon|Venezuela|1954}}'''Venezuela'''&nbsp;\u2013 The [[pavilion]] was a convertible tent structure which opened and closed like a flower. It was very lightweight, was constructed with no waste and completely re-usable. The flower petals were positioned according to the weather, to shade, keep dry or allow sun to shine on the pavilion.

Daimler Chrysler also operated '''Lab.01''', an interactive laboratory showcasing mobility devices including mini-robots.\n*'''EU European Union'''&nbsp;\u2013 The pavilion presented the European Union's vision of Europe.

The exhibit was the first opportunity for indigenous people to represent themselves at a World Expo.\n*'''WWF''' ([[World Wildlife Fund]])&nbsp;\u2013 Pavilion\n*'''The ZERI Pavilion'''&nbsp;\u2013 The largest bamboo structure designed by Simon Velez, was built by 41 Colombian wood workers in less than three months. Over 4,500 bamboos (''Guadua angustifolia'') were joined to become the first building which dances with the rhythm of the earth&nbsp;\u2014 and this with a German building permit. Nine months of intensive scientific research and testing first enabled the acquisition of a temporary permit, and after the building was constructed twice (once in Manizales, Colombia and once in Hanover), the final permit was granted the day before the opening of the Expo 2000. This pavilion presented seven projects from around the world which demonstrated that it is possible to respond to everyone's needs on Earth with what we have. The projects from Colombia, Zimbabwe, Fiji, Sweden and Japan inspired many young people. The pavilion nearly went bankrupt when sales and attendance were so low, but thanks to a single bamboo in the center of the pavilion, enough money was collected to make it to the end. The ZERI Pavilion had an estimated 6.4 million visitors, but it had no doors and no queues.

He is currently playing with [[Vaasan Sport]] of the [[Liiga]].\n\n==Playing career==\n\n===Jokerit===\nNiko Hovinen's SM-liiga career started during the 2005-06 season when Hovinen dressed for a single regular-season Jokerit game as backup to [[Joonas Hallikainen]], after [[Tim Thomas (ice hockey)|Tim Thomas]] abruptly left the team only a day before the start of the 2005\u201306 regular season. Hovinen returned to the junior team for the rest of the season. He made his first SM-liiga start on 23 November 2006, against [[SaiPa]], again called up when three Jokerit goaltenders were injured.\n\nDuring the 2007\u201308 season, Hovinen served as backup to [[Jussi Markkanen]]. Hovinen was relegated to no. 3 goaltender when Jokerit acquired [[Joni Puurula]] from [[SaiPa]] just before the end of regular season. Hovinen dressed up to serve as backup for Joni Puurula in several games during the 2007\u201308 playoffs as Jussi Markkanen got himself injured during the first game of playoffs.\n\n===Pelicans===\nDuring the off-season of 2007\u201308 SM-liiga season, Niko Hovinen was contracted to [[Lahti Pelicans|Pelicans]]. For the first time, Niko Hovinen will play outside of Jokerit-organization in 2008-09 season.\n\nA tall goaltender at 196&nbsp;cm, Hovinen covers the net very well and is considered a highly promising goaltender prospect.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}\n[[File:Niko Hovinen - OKC Barons (1).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Niko Hovinen with the [[Oklahoma City Barons]].]]\nHovinen was ranked #10 on the International Scouting Service's list of goaltender prospects for the [[2006 NHL Entry Draft]].

In the 2015\u201316 campaign, Hovinen was back in his native Finland for a second stint with the [[Lahti Pelicans|Pelicans]].

Balakirev published it with only one verse (the first). The other two verses were added at a later date. [[Ilya Repin]]'s famous painting ''[[Barge Haulers on the Volga]]'' depicts such burlaks in [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]] toiling along the Volga.\n\nThe song was popularised by [[Feodor Chaliapin]], and has been a favourite concert piece of bass singers ever since. [[Bill Finegan]]'s jazz arrangement for the [[Glenn Miller]] band took the song to #1 in the US charts in 1941. Russian composer [[Alexander Glazunov]] based one of the themes of his symphonic poem \"Stenka Razin\" on the song.
