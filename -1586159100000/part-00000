{"title_page": "Unbiased estimation of standard deviation", "text_new": "{{Short description|Procedure to estimate standard deviation from a sample}}In [[statistics]] and in particular [[statistical theory]], '''unbiased estimation of a standard deviation''' is the calculation from a [[statistical sample]] of an estimated value of the [[standard deviation]] (a measure of [[statistical dispersion]]) of a [[statistical population|population]] of values, in such a way that the [[expected value]] of the calculation equals the true value.  Except in some important situations, outlined later, the task has little relevance to applications of statistics since its need is avoided by standard procedures, such as the use of [[significance test]]s and [[confidence intervals]], or by using [[Bayesian analysis]].\n\nHowever, for statistical theory, it provides an exemplar problem in the context of [[estimation theory]] which is both simple to state and for which results cannot be obtained in closed form. It also provides an example where imposing the requirement for [[Bias of an estimator|unbiased estimation]] might be seen as just adding inconvenience, with no real benefit.\n\n==Background==\nIn [[statistics]], the [[standard deviation]] of a population of numbers is often estimated from a [[random sample]] drawn from the population.  This is the sample standard deviation, which is defined by\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{n-1}},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\{x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\}</math> is the sample (formally, realizations from a [[random variable]] ''X'') and <math>\\overline{x}</math> is the [[Sample mean and sample covariance|sample mean]].\n\nOne way of seeing that this is a [[biased estimator]] of the standard deviation of the population is to start from the result that ''s''<sup>2</sup> is an [[unbiased estimator]] for the [[variance]] \u03c3<sup>2</sup> of the underlying population if that variance exists and the sample values are drawn independently with replacement. The square root is a nonlinear function, and only linear functions commute with taking the expectation. Since the square root is a strictly concave function, it follows from [[Jensen's inequality]] that the square root of the sample variance is an underestimate.\n\nThe use of ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 instead of ''n'' in the formula for the sample variance is known as [[Bessel's correction]], which corrects the bias in the estimation of the population ''variance,'' and some, but not all of the bias in the estimation of the sample ''standard deviation.''\n\nIt is not possible to find an estimate of the standard deviation which is unbiased for all population distributions, as the bias depends on the particular distribution. Much of the following relates to estimation assuming a [[normal distribution]].\n\n==Bias correction==\n{{citations|date=December 2014}}\n===Results for the normal distribution===\n[[Image:Stddevc4factor.jpg|thumb|Correction factor <math>c_4</math> versus sample size ''n''.]]\n\nWhen the random variable is [[normal distribution|normally distributed]], a minor correction exists to eliminate the bias. To derive the correction, note that for normally distributed ''X'', [[Cochran's theorem]] implies that <math>(n-1) s^2/\\sigma^2</math> has a [[Chi-squared_distribution|chi square distribution]] with <math>n-1</math> [[Degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)|degrees of freedom]] and thus its square root, <math>\\sqrt{n-1} s/\\sigma</math> has a [[chi distribution]] with <math>n-1</math> degrees of freedom. Consequently, calculating the expectation of this last expression and rearranging constants,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}[s] = c_4(n)\\sigma  </math>\n\nwhere the correction factor <math>c_4(n)</math> is the scale mean of the chi distribution with <math>n-1</math> degrees of freedom, <math>\\mu_1/\\sqrt{n-1}</math>. This depends on the sample size ''n,'' and is given as follows:<ref>Ben W. Bolch, \"More on unbiased estimation of the standard deviation\", The American Statistician, 22(3), p. 27 (1968)</ref>\n\n:<math>c_4(n) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n-1}} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4n} - \\frac{7}{32n^2} - \\frac{19}{128n^3} + O(n^{-4})</math>\n\nwhere \u0393(\u00b7) is the [[gamma function]]. An unbiased estimator of ''\u03c3'' can be obtained by dividing <math>s</math> by <math> c_4(n)</math>. As <math>n</math> grows large it approaches 1, and even for smaller values the correction is minor. The figure shows a plot of <math>c_4(n)</math> versus sample size.

Brugger, \"A Note on Unbiased Estimation on the Standard Deviation\", The American Statistician (23) 4 p. 32 (1969)</ref> to take the estimator\n\n: <math>\\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n-1.5} \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\overline {x})^2}</math>\n\nThe formula differs from the familiar expression for ''s''<sup>2</sup> only by having {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1.5}} instead on {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} in the denominator. This expression is only approximate, in fact\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{E} \\left [\\hat\\sigma \\right ] = \\sigma\\cdot\\left ( 1 + \\frac{1}{16n^2} + \\frac{3}{16n^3} + O(n^{-4}) \\right).</math>\n\nThe bias is relatively small: say, for {{nowrap|''n'' {{}} 3}} it is equal to 1.3%, and for {{nowrap|''n'' {{}} 9}} the bias is already 0.1%.\n\n===Other distributions===\nIn cases where [[statistically independent]] data are modelled by a parametric family of distributions other than the [[normal distribution]], the population standard deviation will, if it exists, be a function of the parameters of the model. One general approach to estimation would be [[maximum likelihood]]. Alternatively, it may be possible to use the [[Rao\u2013Blackwell theorem]] as a route to finding a good estimate of the standard deviation. In neither case would the estimates obtained usually be unbiased. Notionally, theoretical adjustments might be obtainable to lead to unbiased estimates but, unlike those for the normal distribution, these would typically depend on the estimated parameters.\n\nIf the requirement is simply to reduce the bias of an estimated standard deviation, rather than to eliminate it entirely, then two practical approaches are available, both within the context of [[Resampling (statistics)|resampling]]. These are [[Resampling (statistics)#Jackknife|jackknifing]] and [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]]. Both can be applied either to parametrically based estimates of the standard deviation or to the sample standard deviation.\n\nFor non-normal distributions an approximate (up to ''O''(''n''<sup>\u22121</sup>) terms) formula for the unbiased estimator of the standard deviation is\n\n: <math>\\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n - 1.5 - \\tfrac{1}{4} \\gamma_2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left (x_i - \\overline {x} \\right )^2 },</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b3''<sub>2</sub> denotes the population [[excess kurtosis]]. The excess kurtosis may be either known beforehand for certain distributions, or estimated from the data.\n\n==Effect of autocorrelation (serial correlation)==\n\nThe material above, to stress the point again, applies only to independent data. However, real-world data often does not meet this requirement; it is [[autocorrelation|autocorrelated]] (also known as serial correlation). As one example, the successive readings of a measurement instrument that incorporates some form of \u201csmoothing\u201d (more correctly, low-pass filtering) process will be autocorrelated, since any particular value is calculated from some combination of the earlier and later readings.\n\nEstimates of the variance, and standard deviation, of autocorrelated data will be biased. The expected value of the sample variance is<ref>Law and Kelton, ''Simulation Modeling and Analysis'', 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill (1991), p.284, {{isbn|0-07-036698-5}}. This expression can be derived from its original source in Anderson, ''The Statistical Analysis of Time Series'', Wiley (1971), {{isbn|0-471-04745-7}}, p.448, Equation 51.</ref>\n\n:<math>{\\rm E}\\left[s^2\\right] = \\sigma ^2  \\left[ 1- \\frac{2}{n-1}  \\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \\left( 1-\\frac{k}{n}  \\right)\\rho _k \\right]</math>\n\nwhere ''n'' is the sample size (number of measurements) and ''<math>\\rho_k</math>'' is the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the data. (Note that the expression in the brackets is simply one minus the average expected autocorrelation for the readings.) If the ACF consists of positive values then the estimate of the variance (and its square root, the standard deviation) will be biased low. That is, the actual variability of the data will be greater than that indicated by an uncorrected variance or standard deviation calculation. It is essential to recognize that, if this expression is to be used to correct for the bias, by dividing the estimate <math>s^2</math> by the quantity in brackets above, then the ACF must be known '''analytically''', not via estimation from the data. This is because the estimated ACF will itself be biased.<ref>Law and Kelton, p.286.

Except in some important situations, outlined later, the task has little relevance to applications of statistics since its need is avoided by standard procedures, such as the use of [[significance test]]s and [[confidence intervals]], or by using [[Bayesian analysis]].\n\nHowever, for statistical theory, it provides an exemplar problem in the context of [[estimation theory]] which is both simple to state and for which results cannot be obtained in closed form. It also provides an example where imposing the requirement for [[Bias of an estimator|unbiased estimation]] might be seen as just adding inconvenience, with no real benefit.\n\n==Background==\nIn [[statistics]], the [[standard deviation]] of a population of numbers is often estimated from a [[random sample]] drawn from the population.  This is the sample standard deviation, which is defined by\n\n:<math>s = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\overline{x})^2}{n-1}},</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\{x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n\\}</math> is the sample (formally, realizations from a [[random variable]] ''X'') and <math>\\overline{x}</math> is the [[Sample mean and sample covariance|sample mean]].\n\nOne way of seeing that this is a [[biased estimator]] of the standard deviation of the population is to start from the result that ''s''<sup>2</sup> is an [[unbiased estimator]] for the [[variance]] \u03c3<sup>2</sup> of the underlying population if that variance exists and the sample values are drawn independently with replacement. The square root is a nonlinear function, and only linear functions commute with taking the expectation. Since the square root is a strictly concave function, it follows from [[Jensen's inequality]] that the square root of the sample variance is an underestimate.\n\nThe use of ''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1 instead of ''n'' in the formula for the sample variance is known as [[Bessel's correction]], which corrects the bias in the estimation of the population ''variance,'' and some, but not all of the bias in the estimation of the sample ''standard deviation.''\n\nIt is not possible to find an estimate of the standard deviation which is unbiased for all population distributions, as the bias depends on the particular distribution. Much of the following relates to estimation assuming a [[normal distribution]].\n\n==Bias correction==\n{{citations|date=December 2014}}\n===Results for the normal distribution===\n[[Image:Stddevc4factor.jpg|thumb|Correction factor <math>c_4</math> versus sample size ''n''.]]\n\nWhen the random variable is [[normal distribution|normally distributed]], a minor correction exists to eliminate the bias. To derive the correction, note that for normally distributed ''X'', [[Cochran's theorem]] implies that <math>(n-1) s^2/\\sigma^2</math> has a [[Chi-squared_distribution|chi square distribution]] with <math>n-1</math>[[Degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)|degrees of freedom]] and thus its square root, <math>\\sqrt{n-1} s/\\sigma</math> has a [[chi distribution]] with <math>n-1</math> degrees of freedom. Consequently, calculating the expectation of this last expression and rearranging constants,\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{E}[s] = c_4(n)\\sigma  </math>\n\nwhere the correction factor <math>c_4(n)</math> is the scale mean of the chi distribution with <math>n-1</math> degrees of freedom, <math>\\mu_1/\\sqrt{n-1}</math>. This depends on the sample size ''n,'' and is given as follows:<ref>Ben W. Bolch, \"More on unbiased estimation of the standard deviation\", The American Statistician, 22(3), p. 27 (1968)</ref>\n\n:<math>c_4(n) = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n-1}} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)} = 1 - \\frac{1}{4n} - \\frac{7}{32n^2} - \\frac{19}{128n^3} + O(n^{-4})</math>\n\nwhere \u0393(\u00b7) is the [[gamma function]].

Brugger, \"A Note on Unbiased Estimation on the Standard Deviation\", The American Statistician (23) 4 p. 32 (1969)</ref> to take the estimator\n\n: <math>\\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n-1.5} \\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \\overline {x})^2}</math>\n\nThe formula differs from the familiar expression for ''s''<sup>2</sup> only by having {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1.5}} instead on {{nowrap|''n'' \u2212 1}} in the denominator. This expression is only approximate, in fact\n\n: <math>\\operatorname{E} \\left [\\hat\\sigma \\right ] = \\sigma\\cdot\\left ( 1 + \\frac{1}{16n^2} + \\frac{3}{16n^3} + O(n^{-4}) \\right).</math>\n\nThe bias is relatively small: say, for {{nowrap|''n'' {{}} 3}} it is equal to 1.3%, and for {{nowrap|''n'' {{}} 9}} the bias is already 0.1%.\n\n===Other distributions===\nIn cases where [[statistically independent]] data are modelled by a parametric family of distributions other than the [[normal distribution]], the population standard deviation will, if it exists, be a function of the parameters of the model. One general approach to estimation would be [[maximum likelihood]]. Alternatively, it may be possible to use the [[Rao\u2013Blackwell theorem]] as a route to finding a good estimate of the standard deviation. In neither case would the estimates obtained usually be unbiased. Notionally, theoretical adjustments might be obtainable to lead to unbiased estimates but, unlike those for the normal distribution, these would typically depend on the estimated parameters.\n\nIf the requirement is simply to reduce the bias of an estimated standard deviation, rather than to eliminate it entirely, then two practical approaches are available, both within the context of [[Resampling (statistics)|resampling]]. These are [[Resampling (statistics)#Jackknife|jackknifing]] and [[Bootstrapping (statistics)|bootstrapping]]. Both can be applied either to parametrically based estimates of the standard deviation or to the sample standard deviation.\n\nFor non-normal distributions an approximate (up to ''O''(''n''<sup>\u22121</sup>) terms) formula for the unbiased estimator of the standard deviation is\n\n: <math>\\hat\\sigma = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1}{n - 1.5 - \\tfrac{1}{4} \\gamma_2} \\sum_{i=1}^n \\left (x_i - \\overline {x} \\right )^2 },</math>\n\nwhere ''\u03b3''<sub>2</sub> denotes the population [[excess kurtosis]]. The excess kurtosis may be either known beforehand for certain distributions, or estimated from the data.\n\n==Effect of autocorrelation (serial correlation)==\n\nThe material above, to stress the point again, applies only to independent data. However, real-world data often does not meet this requirement; it is [[autocorrelation|autocorrelated]] (also known as serial correlation). As one example, the successive readings of a measurement instrument that incorporates some form of \u201csmoothing\u201d (more correctly, low-pass filtering) process will be autocorrelated, since any particular value is calculated from some combination of the earlier and later readings.\n\nEstimates of the variance, and standard deviation, of autocorrelated data will be biased. The expected value of the sample variance is<ref>Law and Kelton, ''Simulation Modeling and Analysis'', 2nd Ed. McGraw-Hill (1991), p.284, {{isbn|0-07-036698-5}}.

(Note that the expression in the brackets is simply one minus the average expected autocorrelation for the readings.) If the ACF consists of positive values then the estimate of the variance (and its square root, the standard deviation) will be biased low. That is, the actual variability of the data will be greater than that indicated by an uncorrected variance or standard deviation calculation. It is essential to recognize that, if this expression is to be used to correct for the bias, by dividing the estimate <math>s^2</math> by the quantity in brackets above, then the ACF must be known '''analytically''', not via estimation from the data. This is because the estimated ACF will itself be biased.<ref>Law and Kelton, p.286.

Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades.

It is located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of [[Seattle]] and is one of the main cities in the [[Seattle metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] and [[Puget Sound region]]. Everett is the [[List of cities and towns in Washington|seventh-largest]] city in Washington state and had a total population of 103,019 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The city is located at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]] along [[Port Gardner Bay]], an inlet of [[Possession Sound]] (itself part of [[Puget Sound]]).\n\nAmerican settlement on the Everett peninsula began in the 1860s, with several [[sawmill]]s built to serve the area's growing timber industry. Everett was [[plat]]ted by a group of investors seeking to build an industrial city and named for the son of co-founder Charles L. Colby. The city was [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] in 1893, shortly after the arrival of the [[Great Northern Railway (U.S.)|Great Northern Railway]], and prospered as a major industrial center. Everett's economy transitioned away from lumber and towards aviation after [[World War II]], with the construction of [[Boeing]]'s [[Boeing Everett Factory|aircraft assembly plant]] at [[Paine Field]] in 1967. Boeing remains the city's largest employer, alongside the [[U.S. Navy]], which has operated [[Naval Station Everett]] since 1992. Everett received an [[All-America City Award]] in 2002.\n\nEverett remains a major employment center for Snohomish County, but has also become a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle in recent decades. It is connected to Seattle by [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] and various public transit services at [[Everett Station]], including the [[Sounder commuter rail|Sounder commuter train]], [[Amtrak]], and commuter buses.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and settlement===\n[[File:Port Gardner Bay, Everett, Washington, October 1891 (LAROCHE 278).jpeg|thumb|right|Looking south on the [[Seattle and Montana Railroad]] as it passes [[Port Gardner]] Bay in 1891]]\n\nThe [[Port Gardner]] peninsula was originally inhabited by local [[Coast Salish]] tribes who arrived in the region 10,000 years [[before present]] and settled near modern-day Everett approximately 2,000 years [[before present]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}} The [[Snohomish people]] lived around local waterways in the [[Possession Sound]] estuary and had a fortified winter village at Hibulb (also called Hebolb) at the mouth of the [[Snohomish River]].{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=2}}<ref>{{cite news |last=Whitely |first=Peyton |date=March 16, 2005 |title=Aerial photos show 2 very different cities |page=H8 |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/aerial-photos-show-2-very-different-cities/ |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first Europeans in the area were explorers from the 1792 [[Vancouver Expedition]], landing on a beach on the modern Everett waterfront on June 4 and claiming the land for [[England]] on the birthday of King [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]].<ref>{{cite book |author=[[Federal Writers' Project]] |year=1941 |title=The WPA Guide to Washington: The Evergreen State |pages=186\u2013200 |series=[[American Guide Series]] |publisher=[[Works Progress Administration]] |oclc=881468746 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=07PpCAAAQBAJ |via=Google Books |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> [[Puget Sound]] was further explored and charted ny the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in 1824 and the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] under [[Charles Wilkes]] in 1841, ahead of a larger American presence in the area.{{sfnp|O'Donnell|1993|p=4}}<ref name=\"HistoryLink\">{{cite web |last=Oakley |first=Janet |date=July 26, 2005 |title=Everett \u2014 Thumbnail History |url=https://www.historylink.org/file/7397 |work=[[HistoryLink]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Snohomish and other Coast Salish tribes signed the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, which relinquished their lands to the [[Washington Territory|territorial government]] and established the nearby [[Tulalip Indian Reservation]], where they would be relocated.<ref name=\"Herald-125th\">{{cite news |last=Muhlstein |first=Julie |date=May 9, 2018 |title=City of Everett to celebrate 125th birthday with big party |url=https://www.heraldnet.com/news/city-of-everett-celebrates-125-years-and-counting/ |work=[[The Everett Herald]] |accessdate=June 30, 2018}}</ref> The first permanent American settler to arrive on the peninsula was Dennis Brigham, a carpenter from [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], who claimed a {{convert|160|acre|km2|1|adj=on}} [[Homestead Acts|homestead]] and built a cabin for himself.
