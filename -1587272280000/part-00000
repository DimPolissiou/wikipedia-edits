It was written by Samuel Barnes, [[Scott La Rock]], [[Makeba Riddick]], Jean-Claude Oliver, [[KRS-One|Lawrence Parker]], and produced by [[Trackmasters|Poke & Tone]]. It was released on 15 July  2005, as the second and final single from the album. The lyrics revolve around \"basically telling a guy, 'If it's lovin' that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need\".<ref name=\"MTVNews1\"/>\n\nThe song received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised and criticised Rihanna's vocal performance; its composition was also complimented. \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" achieved moderate success around the world, reaching the top forty in few European countries, while reaching the top ten in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. In the United States, the song failed to match the commercial success of Rihanna's previous single, \"[[Pon de Replay]]\", peaking at number 36 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. It managed, however, to reach number nine on the [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Pop Songs]] chart. The song's accompanying [[music video]], directed by [[Marcus Raboy]], was shot on a beach in California, and features the singer enjoying several activities, such as dancing and riding [[jet ski]]s with her friends.\n\n==Background and composition==\n{{listen\n | filename    = Rihanna - If It's Lovin' That You Want.ogg\n | title       = Rihanna \u2014 \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\"\n | description = A 20 second sample of \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\", of which critics both praised Rihanna's vocal range<ref name=\"TheHindu\"/> but also criticized the singer for sounding \"too light\" and \"thin\".<ref name=\"About.com\"/>\n |pos          = left\n | format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\nFollowing the release and commercial success of \"[[Pon de Replay]]\", the lead single from ''Music of the Sun'' and Rihanna's debut in the music industry, \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" was released as the second single from the album.<ref name=\"iTunesAU\">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/if-its-lovin-that-you-want/id99775989|title=If It's Lovin' That You Want \u2013 Single|publisher=[[iTunes Store]] (AU)|date=2005-12-02|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> In an interview with [[MTV News]], Rihanna explained the lyrical meaning behind the song, saying \"The song is basically telling a guy, 'If it's lovin' that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need\".<ref name=\"MTVNews1\">{{cite news|author=Brandee J.

It was written by Samuel Barnes, [[Scott La Rock]], [[Makeba Riddick]], Jean-Claude Oliver, [[KRS-One|Lawrence Parker]], and produced by [[Trackmasters|Poke & Tone]]. It was released on August 30, 2005, as the second and final single from the album. The lyrics revolve around \"basically telling a guy, 'If it's lovin' that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need\".<ref name=\"MTVNews1\"/>\n\nThe song received mixed reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]], many of whom praised and criticised Rihanna's vocal performance; its composition was also complimented. \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" achieved moderate success around the world, reaching the top forty in few European countries, while reaching the top ten in Australia, Ireland and New Zealand. In the United States, the song failed to match the commercial success of Rihanna's previous single, \"[[Pon de Replay]]\", peaking at number 36 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. It managed, however, to reach number nine on the [[Mainstream Top 40 (Pop Songs)|Pop Songs]] chart. The song's accompanying [[music video]], directed by [[Marcus Raboy]], was shot on a beach in California, and features the singer enjoying several activities, such as dancing and riding [[jet ski]]s with her friends.\n\n==Background and composition==\n{{listen\n | filename    = Rihanna - If It's Lovin' That You Want.ogg\n | title       = Rihanna \u2014 \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\"\n | description = A 20 second sample of \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\", of which critics both praised Rihanna's vocal range<ref name=\"TheHindu\"/> but also criticized the singer for sounding \"too light\" and \"thin\".<ref name=\"About.com\"/>\n |pos          = left\n | format      = [[Ogg]]\n}}\nFollowing the release and commercial success of \"[[Pon de Replay]]\", the lead single from ''Music of the Sun'' and Rihanna's debut in the music industry, \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" was released as the second single from the album.<ref name=\"iTunesAU\">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/if-its-lovin-that-you-want/id99775989|title=If It's Lovin' That You Want \u2013 Single|publisher=[[iTunes Store]] (AU)|date=2005-12-02|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref> In an interview with [[MTV News]], Rihanna explained the lyrical meaning behind the song, saying \"The song is basically telling a guy, 'If it's lovin' that you want, you should make me your girl because I've got what you need\".<ref name=\"MTVNews1\">{{cite news|author=Brandee J.

video==\n\n[[File:Screen shot from \u201cIf It's Lovin' That You Want\u201d (music video).jpg|thumb|right|In music video still, [[Rihanna]] lays on a beach.]]\nThe [[music video]] for the song was shot on a stretch of beach on the coast of [[California]] in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] and directed by [[Marcus Raboy]].<ref name=\"MTVNews1\"/> In an interview with MTV News, Rihanna spoke about the development of the shoot for the video, saying \"The water was so cold&nbsp;... but oh my gosh, we had so much fun&nbsp;... We were bumping each other off the Jet Skis and just had a ball\".<ref name=\"MTVNews1\"/> During the interview, the singer elaborated further upon the content of the video and the meaning behind it, saying \"This video is about having fun, giving off the vibe of the Caribbean&nbsp;... we did some mermaid-looking stuff down on the sand&nbsp;...and I'm just [performing] to the camera as if it were my boyfriend. Now we're going to do [some scenes with] the Tiki torches. It's going to be incredible\".<ref name=\"MTVNews1\"/>  The dance routines in the video were [[Choreography|choreographed]] by noted choreographer [[Fatima Robinson]].<ref name=\"MTVNews1\"/>\n\nThe video begins with scenes of Rihanna dancing and walking along the beach and riding [[jet ski]]{{'}}s with her friends during the first chorus and continues into the first verse.<ref name=\"MTVNews1\"/> Halfway through the first verse, a new scene of the singer is introduced, where she is dancing on a platform with four other female dancers, wearing a \"short, flowing white skirt and a cropped tee\",<ref name=\"MTVNews1\"/>  with the ocean as the backdrop behind her. During the second chorus, the previous scenes are intercut with each other, and continue into the second verse, where a new scene of the singer wearing a different outfit and lying on the beach, whilst also choreographing with some male extras. For the third chorus, which is repeated twice, another new scene of Rihanna is shown with four other female dancers who [[belly dance]] in the middle of a [[Tiki culture|Tiki torch]] circle during the night.<ref name=\"MTVNews1\"/>\n\n==Track listing==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* '''Digital download'''<ref name=\"NorwayiTunes\">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/no/album/if-its-lovin-that-you-want/id101833312|title=If It's Lovin' That You Want \u2013 Single|publisher=iTunes Store (NO)|date=2005-12-02|accessdate=2011-10-01|language=Norwegian}}</ref>\n# \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" \u2013 3:50\n\n* '''CD single'''<ref name=\"Amazon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Its-Lovin-That-Want-Pt-1/dp/B000CBLPFQ/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1334201613&sr=8-4|title=Amazon.com: If It's Lovin That You Want Pt.1: Rihanna: Music|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=2012-04-11}}</ref>\n# \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" <small>(Album Version)</small> \u2013 3:28\n# \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" <small>(Instrumental)</small> \u2013 3:20\n# \"Pon de Replay\" <small>(Pon de Club Play)</small> \u2013 7:32\n# \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" <small>(Video)</small> \u2013 3:36\n{{col-2}}\n\n*'''Digital EP'''<ref name=\"IrishiTunes\">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ie/album/if-its-lovin-that-you-want-ep/id98186936|title=If It's Lovin' That You Want \u2013 Single|publisher=iTunes Store (IE)|date=2005-12-02|accessdate=2011-10-01}}</ref>\n# \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" \u2013 3:27\n# \"If It's Lovin' that You Want\" <small>(Instrumental)</small> \u2013 3:20\n# \"Pon de Replay\" <small>(Pon de Club Play)</small> \u2013 7:32\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|-\n!

Crupi had left Melbourne shortly after bombing, making him a prime suspect. Under police questioning, Crupi admitted that he had a hatred towards a detective who worked at Russell Street but stated that the homemade device recovered in his home was a fake and was meant to planted at a police station in [[Flemington, Victoria | Flemington]].\n\nA major breakthrough in the investigation came from a police report filed three weeks prior to the bombing. On the 6 March 1986, a Victoria  Police Traffic unit was in pursuit of a stolen red [[Daimler Sovereign]] in [[East Keilor, Victoria | East Keilor]], the pursuit came to the end when the driver wrecked the Daimler. The driver fled on foot into nearby [[St. Albans, Victoria | St. Albans]] where he had carjacked a passing motorist at gunpoint and made his escape. In the boot of the Daimler, police found a [[backpack]], containing a set of [[Vehicle registration plates of Victoria | number plates]] that had been cut into pieces. When the pieces were put back together, the number plates; CCH-997 had came back to a silver [[Holden Commodore (VK)#SS Group A | VK Commodore HDT]] that had also been stolen before the bombing. This second Commodore matched the description of a vehicle being used in a armed robbery of a bank in [[Donvale, Victoria | Donvale]] hours after the bombing in which the Commodore was used to crash into the front window of the bank. The vehicle was later recovered from the [[Yarra River]] at [[Wonga Park, Victoria | Wonga Park]] on the 7 April 1986. \n\nUpon the examination of the silver Commodore by the Victoria Police Stolen Motor Vehicles Squad, detectives discovered that the vehicle's [[Vehicle identification number | VIN]] on the chassis had been drilled out. The drill marks on the silver Commodore's VIN were found to be identical to the VIN on the Commodore used in the bombing and the silver Commodore's number plates were recovered from the Daimler, linking the stolen Daimler and the Donvale robbery to the Russell Street Bombing.  \n\nIn a statement given to the detectives, the traffic officer caught a glimpse of the driver from the Daimler during the chase and out of a series of mugshots, identified the driver as Peter Reed. Reed (born Peter Komiazyk) was a suspected armed robber and car thief.<ref>''The Russell Street Bombing''</ref> As Reed was a person of interest in several violent armed robberies and car thefts, his address and the addresses of Reed's family members and several of his associates were placed under police surveillance.\n\n==Arrests==\nOn 25 April 1986, ten [[Victoria Police]] officers raided the [[Kallista, Victoria|Kallista]] home of Peter Michael Reed at 5:45 a.m. It was alleged that upon attempting to enforce the arrest by forcing entry to the premises, Reed produced a [[.455]] [[Smith & Wesson]] [[revolver]] and fired at police, seriously wounding Detective Sergeant Mark Wylie. Reed was then fired upon by Det. Sgt. Steve Quinsee, who was also wounded and arrested.\n\nDuring the search of Reed's home, detectives found several firearms with drill marks similar to the drill marks on both the bomb car and the stolen silver Commodore. Also recovered at Reed's home was a police scanner and two detonators sitting on a backpack identical to the detonators used in the bombing. Inside of the backpack were sticks of gelignite identical to the sticks of gelignite used in the bomb car.\n\nFingerprints found on the door of the toilet at Reed's home matched to Craig Minogue and fingerprints found on the newspaper wrapped around the sticks of gelignite matched to Craig Minogue's brother; Rodney Minogue. The Minogue Brothers were both associates of Reed in which Rodney Minogue had served time in prison with Reed. \n\nPolice later raided an house of an associate known to both Reed and the Minogue Brothers in [[Nunawading, Victoria | Nunawading]]. Evidence recovered from the associate's home matched as the source of the components used in the construction of the bomb including a fence post from a neighbouring yard that matched a block of wood found at the Russell Street scene and a metal rubbish bin that matched a metal strip used to hold the wired components of the bomb in place. Under police questioning, the associate stated that he saw Craig Minogue drive the Commodore identical to the Commodore used in the bombing into the garage of the associate's home. The associate also stated that Craig Minogue had paid for the associate and his girlfriend to travel to Sydney before the bombing with the return airline ticket dated for after the bombing. The associate then stated the when he and his girlfriend returned from Sydney after the bombing, he saw the Minogue Brothers filling up a small [[Trailer (vehicle) | trailer]] and was told by Craig Minogue that he and his brother were moving out from the associate's home.\n\nThe detectives was then told that an\n\n==Trial==\nReed was charged with attempted murder, recklessly causing serious injury, using a firearm to prevent apprehension and possessing explosives in suspicious circumstances in addition to charges related to the Russell Street bombing. Reed later reportedly stated at his trial in unsworn evidence that ''\"the police started the shooting and I only used [my] firearm in self defence.\"''\n\nThe Crown did not allege that any person played any particular role in the bombing, but that each of them were members of a team which planned the bombing and caused the bomb to explode. Evidence against the accused was as follows:\n* Gelignite and detonators used in the construction of the bomb were of the same type as those stolen from a mine.\n* Gelignite was found at Reed's house wrapped in newspaper containing [[fingerprint]]s belonging to Rodney Minogue.\n* Craig Minogue owned a pair of side cutters which produced cuts similar to those found on detonator wires.\n* a file with traces of brass deposits matched with brass deposits found at the bomb site.\n* a block of wood from which a wooden part of the bomb had been sawn was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* tinned copper wire, similar to that used with detonators found at the bomb site, was found at Craig Minogue's premises.\n* residue of gelignite matched residue found at a previous address of Craig Minogue in Lower [[Templestowe]].\n* evidence from a witness that Craig Minogue called around Easter 1986, to ask about the use of detonators.\n* a witness testified that Craig Minogue was seen driving a 1979 Holden Commodore around the CBD prior to the explosion.\n* another witness testified that before the bombing, that they discovered a box of explosives at a house they shared with the Minogue Brothers and was told by Craig Minogue to \"forget what they seen\".\n\nAt the end of a six month trial in the Supreme Court of Victoria in 1988 before His Honour Justice Vincent, Taylor and Craig Minogue were convicted of murder and various other offences related to the bombing.  Peter Reed and Rodney Minogue were acquitted of any offences related to the bombing but Reed was convicted of a number of offences related to his arrest, and was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment.\n\nTaylor was sentenced to life imprisonment with no minimum term (ie never to be released), the first person in Victoria to be so sentenced.
