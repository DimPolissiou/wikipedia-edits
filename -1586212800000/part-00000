The Hohmann transfer often uses the lowest possible amount of [[propellant]] in traveling between these orbits, but [[bi-elliptic transfer]]s can beat it in some cases.\n\nThe [[orbital maneuver]] to perform the Hohmann transfer uses two engine impulses, one to move a [[spacecraft]] onto the [[transfer orbit]] and a second to move off it. This maneuver was named after [[Walter Hohmann]], the [[Germany|German]] scientist who published a description of it in his 1925 book ''Die Erreichbarkeit der Himmelsk\u00f6rper'' (''The Attainability of Celestial Bodies'').<ref>Walter Hohmann, ''The Attainability of Heavenly Bodies'' (Washington: NASA Technical Translation F-44, 1960) [https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19980230631 Internet Archive].</ref> Hohmann was influenced in part by the German science fiction author [[Kurd Lasswitz]] and his 1897 book ''[[Two Planets]]''.\n\nThe elliptic transfer orbits between different bodies (planets, moons etc.) are often referred to as Hohmann transfer orbits. When used for traveling between celestial bodies, a Hohmann transfer orbit requires that the starting and destination points be at particular locations in their orbits relative to each other.  Space missions using a Hohmann transfer must wait for this required alignment to occur, which opens a so-called [[launch window]].  For a space mission between [[Earth]] and [[Mars]], for example, these launch windows occur every 26 months.  A Hohmann transfer orbit also determines a fixed time required to travel between the starting and destination points; for an Earth-Mars journey this travel time is about 9 months. When transfer is performed between orbits close to celestial bodies with significant gravitation, much less [[delta-v]] is usually required, as [[Oberth effect]] may be employed for the burns.\n\nThey are also often used for these situations, but [[Low-energy transfer|low-energy transfers]] which take into account the thrust limitations of real engines, and take advantage of the gravity wells of both planets can be more fuel efficient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universetoday.com/117615/making-the-trip-to-mars-cheaper-and-easier-the-case-for-ballistic-capture/|title=Making the Trip to Mars Cheaper and Easier: The Case for Ballistic Capture|last=Williams|first=Matt|date=2014-12-26|website=Universe Today|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-new-way-to-reach-mars-safely-anytime-and-on-the-cheap/|title=A New Way to Reach Mars Safely, Anytime and on the Cheap|last=Hadhazy|first=Adam|website=Scientific American|language=en|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gereshes.com/2019/04/08/an-introduction-to-beresheet-and-its-trajectory-to-the-moon/|title=An Introduction to Beresheet and Its Trajectory to the Moon|date=2019-04-08|website=Gereshes|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\n== Explanation ==\nThe diagram shows a Hohmann transfer orbit to bring a spacecraft from a lower circular orbit into a higher one. It is one half of an [[elliptic orbit]] that touches both the lower circular orbit the spacecraft wishes to leave (blue and labeled ''1'' on diagram) and the higher circular orbit that it wishes to reach (red and labeled ''3'' on diagram). The transfer (yellow and labeled ''2'' on diagram) is initiated by firing the spacecraft's engine to accelerate it so that it will follow the elliptical orbit. This adds energy to the spacecraft's orbit. When the spacecraft has reached its destination orbit, its orbital speed (and hence its orbital energy) must be increased again to change the elliptic orbit to the larger circular one.\n\n[[File:Hohmann transfer orbit2.svg|thumb]]\nDue to the [[reversibility of orbits]], Hohmann transfer orbits also work to bring a spacecraft from a higher orbit into a lower one; in this case, the spacecraft's engine is fired in the opposite direction to its current path, slowing the spacecraft and causing it to drop into the lower-energy elliptical transfer orbit. The engine is then fired again at the lower distance to slow the spacecraft into the lower circular orbit.\n\nThe Hohmann transfer orbit is based on two [[Impulse function|instantaneous]] velocity changes. Extra fuel is required to compensate for the fact that the bursts take time; this is minimized by using high-thrust engines to minimize the duration of the bursts.  For transfers in Earth orbit, the two burns are labelled the ''perigee burn'' and the ''apogee burn'' (or '[[Apogee kick motor|'apogee kick'']]<ref>Jonathan McDowell, \"[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1997-3133 Kick In the Apogee: 40 years of upper stage applications for solid rocket motors, 1957-1997]\", 33rd AIAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 4, 1997. [https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1997-3133 abstract]. Retrieved 18 July 2017.</ref>); more generally, they are labelled ''periapsis'' and ''apoapsis'' burns.  Alternately, the second burn to circularize the orbit may be referred to as a ''circularization burn''.\n\n===Type I and Type II===\n\nAn ideal Hohmann transfer orbit transfers between two circular orbits in the same plane and traverses exactly 180\u00b0 around the primary.  In the real world, the destination orbit may not be circular, and may not be coplanar with the initial orbit.  Real world transfer orbits may traverse slightly more, or slightly less, than 180\u00b0 around the primary.  An orbit which traverses less than 180\u00b0 around the primary is called a \"Type I\" Hohmann transfer, while an orbit which traverses more than 180\u00b0 is called a \"Type II\" Hohmann transfer.<ref name= \"NASA-trajectories\">NASA, ''Basics of Space Flight'', Section 1, Chapter 4, \"[https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/chapter4-1 Trajectories]\".

Typically, <math>\\mu</math> is given in units of m<sup>3</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>, as such be sure to use meters, not kilometers, for <math>r_1</math> and <math>r_2</math>. The total <math>\\Delta v</math> is then:\n\n:<math>\\Delta v_\\text{total} \n= \\Delta v_1 + \\Delta v_2. </math>\n\nWhether moving into a higher or lower orbit, by [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Kepler's understanding of the laws|Kepler's third law]], the time taken to transfer between the orbits is\n\n:<math> t_\\text{H}\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi^2 a_\\text{H}^3}{\\mu}}\n= \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac {(r_1 + r_2)^3}{8\\mu}} </math>\n(one half of the [[orbital period]] for the whole ellipse), where <math> a_\\text{H}</math> is length of [[semi-major axis]] of the Hohmann transfer orbit.\n\nIn application to traveling from one celestial body to another it is crucial to start maneuver at the time when the two bodies are properly aligned. Considering the target angular velocity being\n\n:<math> \\omega_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r_2^3}}, </math>\n\nangular alignment \u03b1 (in [[radian]]s) at the time of start between the source object and the target object shall be\n\n:<math> \\alpha = \\pi - \\omega_2 t_\\text{H} = \\pi\\left(1 -\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{2}}\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2} + 1\\right)^3}\\right). </math>\n\n== Example ==\n[[File:Total energy during Hohmann transfer.png|thumb|upright1.2|Total energy balance during a Hohmann transfer between two circular orbits with first radius <math>r_p</math> and second radius <math>r_a</math>]]\nConsider a [[geostationary transfer orbit]], beginning at ''r''<sub>1</sub> = 6,678&nbsp;km (altitude 300&nbsp;km) and ending in a [[geostationary orbit]] with ''r''<sub>2</sub> = 42,164&nbsp;km (altitude 35,786&nbsp;km).\n\nIn the smaller circular orbit the speed is 7.73&nbsp;km/s; in the larger one, 3.07&nbsp;km/s. In the elliptical orbit in between the speed varies from 10.15&nbsp;km/s at the perigee to 1.61&nbsp;km/s at the apogee.\n\nThe \u0394v for the two burns are thus 10.15&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;7.73 = 2.42 and 3.07&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.61 = 1.46&nbsp;km/s, together 3.88&nbsp;km/s.\n\nThis is ''greater'' than the \u0394v required for an [[escape orbit]]: 10.93&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;7.73 = 3.20&nbsp;km/s. Applying a \u0394v at the [[Low Earth orbit]] (LEO) of only 0.78&nbsp;km/s more (3.20\u22122.42) would give the rocket the [[escape speed]], which is less than the \u0394v of 1.46&nbsp;km/s required to circularize the geosynchronous orbit.  This illustrates the [[Oberth effect]] that at large speeds the same \u0394v provides more [[specific orbital energy]], and energy increase is maximized if one spends the \u0394v as quickly as possible, rather than spending some, being decelerated by gravity, and then spending some more to overcome the deceleration (of course, the objective of a Hohmann transfer orbit is different).\n\n== Worst case, maximum delta-''v'' ==\nAs the example above demonstrates, the \u0394''v'' required to perform a Hohmann transfer between two circular orbits is not the greatest when the destination radius is infinite.  (Escape speed is {{radic|2}} times orbital speed, so the \u0394v required to escape is {{radic|2}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 (41.4%) of the orbital speed.) The \u0394v required is greatest (53.0% of smaller orbital speed) when the radius of the larger orbit is 15.5817... times that of the smaller orbit.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Vallado |first=David Anthony |title=Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications |page=317 |publisher=Springer |date=2001 |isbn=0-7923-6903-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJLlWzMBKjkC&printsec}}</ref> This number is the positive root of &nbsp;x<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;15&nbsp;x<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;9&nbsp;x&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, which is&nbsp; <math>5+4\\,\\sqrt{7}\\cos\\left({1\\over 3}\\arctan{\\sqrt{3}\\over 37}\\right)</math>.  For higher orbit ratios the \u0394''v'' required for the second burn decreases faster than the first increases.\n\n== Application to interplanetary travel ==\n\nWhen used to move a spacecraft from orbiting one planet to orbiting another, the situation becomes somewhat more complex, but much less delta-''v'' is required, due to the [[Oberth effect]], than the sum of the delta-''v'' required to escape the first planet plus the delta-''v'' required for a Hohmann transfer to the second planet.\n\nFor example, consider a spacecraft travelling from [[Earth]] to [[Mars]]. At the beginning of its journey, the spacecraft will already have a certain velocity and kinetic energy associated with its orbit around Earth. During the burn the rocket engine applies its delta-''v'', but the kinetic energy increases as a square law, until it is sufficient to [[escape velocity|escape the planet's gravitational potential]], and then burns more so as to gain enough energy to get into the Hohmann transfer orbit (around the [[Sun]]). Because the rocket engine is able to make use of the initial kinetic energy of the propellant, far less delta-''v'' is required over and above that needed to reach escape velocity, and the optimum situation is when the transfer burn is made at minimum altitude (low [[periapsis]]) above the planet. The delta-''v'' needed is only 3.6&nbsp;km/s, only about 0.4&nbsp;km/s more than needed to escape Earth, even though this results in the spacecraft going 2.9&nbsp;km/s faster than the Earth as it heads off for Mars (see table below).\n\nAt the other end, the spacecraft will need a certain velocity to orbit Mars, which will actually be less than the velocity needed to continue orbiting the Sun in the transfer orbit, let alone attempting to orbit the Sun in a Mars-like orbit. Therefore, the spacecraft will have to decelerate in order for the [[gravity of Mars]] to capture it. This capture burn should optimally be done at low altitude to also make best use of Oberth effect. Therefore, relatively small amounts of thrust at either end of the trip are needed to arrange the transfer compared to the free space situation.\n\nHowever, with any Hohmann transfer, the alignment of the two planets in their orbits is crucial &ndash; the destination planet and the spacecraft must arrive at the same point in their respective orbits around the Sun at the same time.  This requirement for alignment gives rise to the concept of [[launch window]]s.\n\nThe term lunar transfer orbit (LTO) is used for the [[Moon]].\n\nIt is possible to apply the formula given above to calculate the \u0394v in km/s needed to enter a Hohmann transfer orbit to arrive at various destinations from Earth (assuming circular orbits for the planets). In this table, the column labeled \"\u0394v to enter Hohmann orbit from Earth's orbit\" gives the change from Earth's velocity to the velocity needed to get on a Hohmann ellipse whose other end will be at the desired distance from the Sun. The column labeled \"v exiting LEO\" gives the velocity needed (in a non-rotating frame of reference centered on the earth) when 300&nbsp;km above the Earth's surface. This is obtained by adding to the specific kinetic energy the square of the speed (7.73&nbsp;km/s) of this low Earth orbit (that is, the depth of Earth's gravity well at this LEO). The column \"\u0394v from LEO\" is simply the previous speed minus 7.73&nbsp;km/s.\n\n{|style=\"text-align:left;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Destination\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Orbital<br>radius<br>([[astronomical unit|AU]])\n! colspan=\"3\" | \u0394v (km/s)\n|-\n! to enter Hohmann orbit<br>from Earth's orbit\n! exiting<br>LEO\n! from<br>LEO\n|-\n| [[Sun]]\n|align=center|0\n|align=center| 29.8\n|align=center| 31.7\n|align=center| 24.0\n|-\n|[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]\n|align=center| 0.39\n|align=center| 7.5\n|align=center| 13.3\n|align=center| 5.5\n|-\n|[[Venus]]\n|align=center| 0.72\n|align=center| 2.5\n|align=center| 11.2\n|align=center| 3.5\n|-\n|[[Mars]]\n|align=center| 1.52\n|align=center| 2.9\n|align=center| 11.3\n|align=center| 3.6\n|-\n|[[Jupiter]]\n|align=center| 5.2\n|align=center| 8.8\n|align=center| 14.0\n|align=center| 6.3\n|-\n|[[Saturn]]\n|align=center| 9.54\n|align=center| 10.3\n|align=center| 15.0\n|align=center| 7.3\n|-\n|[[Uranus]]\n|align=center| 19.19\n|align=center| 11.3\n|align=center| 15.7\n|align=center| 8.0\n|-\n|[[Neptune]]\n|align=center| 30.07\n|align=center| 11.7\n|align=center| 16.0\n|align=center| 8.2\n|-\n|[[Pluto]]\n|align=center| 39.48\n|align=center| 11.8\n|align=center| 16.1\n|align=center| 8.4\n|-\n|[[Infinity]]\n|align=center| \u221e\n|align=center| 12.3\n|align=center| 16.5\n|align=center| 8.8\n|-\n|}\n\nNote that in most cases, \u0394''v'' from LEO is less than the \u0394''v'' to enter Hohmann orbit from Earth's orbit.\n\nTo get to the Sun, it is actually not necessary to use a \u0394''v'' of 24&nbsp;km/s. One can use 8.8&nbsp;km/s to go very far away from the Sun, then use a negligible \u0394''v'' to bring the angular momentum to zero, and then fall into the Sun. This can be considered a sequence of two Hohmann transfers, one up and one down. Also, the table does not give the values that would apply when using the Moon for a [[gravity assist]]. There are also possibilities of using one planet, like Venus which is the easiest to get to, to assist getting to other planets or the Sun.\n\n==Comparison to other transfers==\n\n=== Bi-elliptic transfer ===\n{{main|Bi-elliptic transfer}}\nThe bi-elliptic transfer consists of two half-[[elliptic orbit]]s. From the initial orbit, a first burn expends delta-v to boost the spacecraft into the first transfer orbit with an [[apoapsis]] at some point <math>r_b</math> away from the [[central body]]. At this point a second burn sends the spacecraft into the second elliptical orbit with [[periapsis]] at the radius of the final desired orbit, where a third burn is performed, injecting the spacecraft into the desired orbit.<ref name=\"Curtis\">{{Cite book | last = Curtis | first = Howard | title = Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students | page = 264 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-7506-6169-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6aO9aGNBAgIC}}</ref>\n\nWhile they require one more engine burn than a Hohmann transfer and generally require a greater travel time, some bi-elliptic transfers require a lower amount of total delta-v than a Hohmann transfer when the ratio of final to initial [[semi-major axis]] is 11.94 or greater, depending on the intermediate semi-major axis chosen.<ref name=\"Vallado\">{{Cite book | last = Vallado | first = David Anthony | title = Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications | page = 318 | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-7923-6903-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PJLlWzMBKjkC&printsec}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of the bi-elliptical transfer trajectory was first{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}<!-- a primary source of Sternfeld's paper does not establish that he was the \"first\" --> published by [[Ary Sternfeld]] in 1934.<ref name=sternfeld1934>\n{{Citation |last=Sternfeld |first=Ary {{sic|J.|expected=A.}} |title=Sur les trajectoires permettant d'approcher d'un corps attractif central \u00e0 partir d'une orbite kepl\u00e9rienne donn\u00e9e |language=French |trans-title=On the allowed trajectories for approaching a central attractive body from a given Keplerian orbit |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k31506/f711.image.langEN |journal=Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences |location=Paris |volume=198 |number=1 |date=1934-02-12 |pages=711\u2013713}}.</ref>\n\n=== Low-thrust transfer ===\n\nLow-thrust engines can perform an approximation of a Hohmann transfer orbit, by creating a gradual enlargement of the initial circular orbit through carefully timed engine firings. This requires a [[Delta-v|change in velocity (delta-''v'')]] that is greater than the two-impulse transfer orbit<ref name=\"MIT_16.522\">MIT, ''16.522: Space Propulsion'', Session 6, \"[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-522-space-propulsion-spring-2015/lecture-notes/MIT16_522S15_Lecture6.pdf Analytical Approximations for Low Thrust Maneuvers]\", Spring 2015 (retrieved 26 July 2017)\n</ref> and takes longer to complete.\n\nEngines such as [[ion thruster]]s are more difficult to analyze with the delta-''v'' model. These engines offer a very low thrust and at the same time, much higher delta-''v'' budget, much higher [[specific impulse]], lower mass of fuel and engine. A 2-burn Hohmann transfer maneuver would be impractical with such a low thrust; the maneuver mainly optimizes the use of fuel, but in this situation there is relatively plenty of it.\n\nIf only low-thrust maneuvers are planned on a mission, then continuously firing a low-thrust, but very high-efficiency engine might generate a higher delta-''v'' and at the same time use less propellant than a conventional chemical rocket engine.\n\nGoing from one circular orbit to another by gradually changing the radius simply requires the same delta-''v'' as the difference between the two speeds.<ref name=\"MIT_16.522\" /> Such maneuver requires more delta-''v'' than a 2-burn Hohmann transfer maneuver, but does so with continuous low thrust rather than the short applications of high thrust.\n\nThe amount of propellant mass used measures the efficiency of the maneuver plus the hardware employed for it. The total delta-''v'' used measures the efficiency of the maneuver only. For [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] systems, which tend to be low-thrust, the high efficiency of the propulsive system usually compensates for the higher delta-V compared to the more efficient Hohmann maneuver.\n\nTransfer orbit using electrical propulsion or low-thrust engines optimize the transfer time to reach the final orbit and not the delta-v as in the Hohmann transfer orbit. For geostationary orbit, the initial orbit is set to be supersynchronous and by thrusting continuously in the direction of the velocity at apogee, the transfer orbit transforms to a circular geosynchronous one. This method however takes much longer to achieve due to the low thrust injected into the orbit <ref>{{Cite book | last = Spitzer | first = Arnon | title = Optimal Transfer Orbit Trajectory using Electric Propulsion | publisher = [[USPTO]] | date = 1997 | url = http://www.google.com/patents/US5595360}}</ref>\n\n===Interplanetary Transport Network===\n{{main article|Interplanetary Transport Network}}\nIn 1997, a set of orbits known as the Interplanetary Transport Network (ITN) was published, providing even lower propulsive delta-''v'' (though much slower and longer) paths between different orbits than Hohmann transfer orbits.<ref>{{cite web |last1= Lo |first1= M.

The Hohmann transfer often uses the lowest possible amount of [[propellant]] in traveling between these orbits, but [[bi-elliptic transfer]]s can beat it in some cases.\n\nThe [[orbital maneuver]] to perform the Hohmann transfer uses two engine impulses, one to move a [[spacecraft]] onto the [[transfer orbit]] and a second to move off it. This maneuver was named after [[Walter Hohmann]], the [[Germany|German]] scientist who published a description of it in his 1925 book ''Die Erreichbarkeit der Himmelsk\u00f6rper'' (''The Attainability of Celestial Bodies'').<ref>Walter Hohmann, ''The Attainability of Heavenly Bodies'' (Washington: NASA Technical Translation F-44, 1960) [https://archive.org/details/nasa_techdoc_19980230631 Internet Archive].</ref> Hohmann was influenced in part by the German science fiction author [[Kurd Lasswitz]] and his 1897 book ''[[Two Planets]]''.\n\nThe elliptic transfer orbits between different bodies (planets, moons etc.) are often referred to as Hohmann transfer orbits. When used for traveling between celestial bodies, a Hohmann transfer orbit requires that the starting and destination points be at particular locations in their orbits relative to each other.  Space missions using a Hohmann transfer must wait for this required alignment to occur, which opens a so-called [[launch window]].  For a space mission between [[Earth]] and [[Mars]], for example, these launch windows occur every 26 months.  A Hohmann transfer orbit also determines a fixed time required to travel between the starting and destination points; for an Earth-Mars journey this travel time is about 9 months. When transfer is performed between orbits close to celestial bodies with significant gravitation, much less [[delta-v]] is usually required, as [[Oberth effect]] may be employed for the burns.\n\nThey are also often used for these situations, but [[Low-energy transfer|low-energy transfers]] which take into account the thrust limitations of real engines, and take advantage of the gravity wells of both planets can be more fuel efficient.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.universetoday.com/117615/making-the-trip-to-mars-cheaper-and-easier-the-case-for-ballistic-capture/|title=Making the Trip to Mars Cheaper and Easier: The Case for Ballistic Capture|last=Williams|first=Matt|date=2014-12-26|website=Universe Today|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-new-way-to-reach-mars-safely-anytime-and-on-the-cheap/|title=A New Way to Reach Mars Safely, Anytime and on the Cheap|last=Hadhazy|first=Adam|website=Scientific American|language=en|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gereshes.com/2019/04/08/an-introduction-to-beresheet-and-its-trajectory-to-the-moon/|title=An Introduction to Beresheet and Its Trajectory to the Moon|date=2019-04-08|website=Gereshes|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-29}}</ref>\n\n== Explanation ==\nThe diagram shows a Hohmann transfer orbit to bring a spacecraft from a lower circular orbit into a higher one. It is one half of an [[elliptic orbit]] that touches both the lower circular orbit the spacecraft wishes to leave (blue and labeled ''1'' on diagram) and the higher circular orbit that it wishes to reach (red and labeled ''3'' on diagram). The transfer (yellow and labeled ''2'' on diagram) is initiated by firing the spacecraft's engine to accelerate it so that it will follow the elliptical orbit. This adds energy to the spacecraft's orbit. When the spacecraft has reached its destination orbit, its orbital speed (and hence its orbital energy) must be increased again to change the elliptic orbit to the larger circular one.\n\n[[File:Hohmann transfer orbit2.svg|thumb]]\nDue to the [[reversibility of orbits]], Hohmann transfer orbits also work to bring a spacecraft from a higher orbit into a lower one; in this case, the spacecraft's engine is fired in the opposite direction to its current path, slowing the spacecraft and causing it to drop into the lower-energy elliptical transfer orbit. The engine is then fired again at the lower distance to slow the spacecraft into the lower circular orbit.\n\nThe Hohmann transfer orbit is based on two [[Impulse function|instantaneous]] velocity changes. Extra fuel is required to compensate for the fact that the bursts take time; this is minimized by using high-thrust engines to minimize the duration of the bursts.  For transfers in Earth orbit, the two burns are labelled the ''perigee burn'' and the ''apogee burn'' (or '[[Apogee kick motor|'apogee kick'']]<ref>Jonathan McDowell, \"[https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/pdf/10.2514/6.1997-3133 Kick In the Apogee: 40 years of upper stage applications for solid rocket motors, 1957-1997]\", 33rd AIAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 4, 1997. [https://arc.aiaa.org/doi/abs/10.2514/6.1997-3133 abstract]. Retrieved 18 July 2017.</ref>); more generally, they are labelled ''periapsis'' and ''apoapsis'' burns.  Alternately, the second burn to circularize the orbit may be referred to as a ''circularization burn''.\n\n===Type I and Type II===\n\nAn ideal Hohmann transfer orbit transfers between two circular orbits in the same plane and traverses exactly 180\u00b0 around the primary.  In the real world, the destination orbit may not be circular, and may not be coplanar with the initial orbit.  Real world transfer orbits may traverse slightly more, or slightly less, than 180\u00b0 around the primary.  An orbit which traverses less than 180\u00b0 around the primary is called a \"Type I\" Hohmann transfer, while an orbit which traverses more than 180\u00b0 is called a \"Type II\" Hohmann transfer.<ref name= \"NASA-trajectories\">NASA, ''Basics of Space Flight'', Section 1, Chapter 4, \"[https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/basics/chapter4-1 Trajectories]\".

Typically, <math>\\mu</math> is given in units of m<sup>3</sup>/s<sup>2</sup>, as such be sure to use meters, not kilometers, for <math>r_1</math> and <math>r_2</math>. The total <math>\\Delta v</math> is then:\n\n:<math>\\Delta v_\\text{total} \n= \\Delta v_1 + \\Delta v_2. </math>\n\nWhether moving into a higher or lower orbit, by [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Kepler's understanding of the laws|Kepler's third law]], the time taken to transfer between the orbits is\n\n:<math> t_\\text{H}\n= \\frac{1}{2}\\sqrt{\\frac{4\\pi^2 a_\\text{H}^3}{\\mu}}\n= \\pi \\sqrt{\\frac {(r_1 + r_2)^3}{8\\mu}} </math>\n(one half of the [[orbital period]] for the whole ellipse), where <math> a_\\text{H}</math> is length of [[semi-major axis]] of the Hohmann transfer orbit.\n\nIn application to traveling from one celestial body to another it is crucial to start maneuver at the time when the two bodies are properly aligned. Considering the target angular velocity being\n\n:<math> \\omega_2 = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\mu}{r_2^3}}, </math>\n\nangular alignment \u03b1 (in [[radian]]s) at the time of start between the source object and the target object shall be\n\n:<math> \\alpha = \\pi - \\omega_2 t_\\text{H} = \\pi\\left(1 -\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{r_1}{r_2} + 1\\right)^3}\\right). </math>\n\n== Example ==\n[[File:Total energy during Hohmann transfer.png|thumb|upright1.2|Total energy balance during a Hohmann transfer between two circular orbits with first radius <math>r_p</math> and second radius <math>r_a</math>]]\nConsider a [[geostationary transfer orbit]], beginning at ''r''<sub>1</sub> = 6,678&nbsp;km (altitude 300&nbsp;km) and ending in a [[geostationary orbit]] with ''r''<sub>2</sub> = 42,164&nbsp;km (altitude 35,786&nbsp;km).\n\nIn the smaller circular orbit the speed is 7.73&nbsp;km/s; in the larger one, 3.07&nbsp;km/s. In the elliptical orbit in between the speed varies from 10.15&nbsp;km/s at the perigee to 1.61&nbsp;km/s at the apogee.\n\nThe \u0394v for the two burns are thus 10.15&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;7.73 = 2.42 and 3.07&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1.61 = 1.46&nbsp;km/s, together 3.88&nbsp;km/s.\n\nThis is ''greater'' than the \u0394v required for an [[escape orbit]]: 10.93&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;7.73 = 3.20&nbsp;km/s. Applying a \u0394v at the [[Low Earth orbit]] (LEO) of only 0.78&nbsp;km/s more (3.20\u22122.42) would give the rocket the [[escape speed]], which is less than the \u0394v of 1.46&nbsp;km/s required to circularize the geosynchronous orbit.  This illustrates the [[Oberth effect]] that at large speeds the same \u0394v provides more [[specific orbital energy]], and energy increase is maximized if one spends the \u0394v as quickly as possible, rather than spending some, being decelerated by gravity, and then spending some more to overcome the deceleration (of course, the objective of a Hohmann transfer orbit is different).\n\n== Worst case, maximum delta-''v'' ==\nAs the example above demonstrates, the \u0394''v'' required to perform a Hohmann transfer between two circular orbits is not the greatest when the destination radius is infinite.  (Escape speed is {{radic|2}} times orbital speed, so the \u0394v required to escape is {{radic|2}}&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 (41.4%) of the orbital speed.) The \u0394v required is greatest (53.0% of smaller orbital speed) when the radius of the larger orbit is 15.5817... times that of the smaller orbit.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Vallado |first=David Anthony |title=Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications |page=317 |publisher=Springer |date=2001 |isbn=0-7923-6903-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJLlWzMBKjkC&printsec}}</ref> This number is the positive root of &nbsp;x<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;15&nbsp;x<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;9&nbsp;x&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, which is&nbsp; <math>5+4\\,\\sqrt{7}\\cos\\left({1\\over 3}\\arctan{\\sqrt{3}\\over 37}\\right)</math>.  For higher orbit ratios the \u0394''v'' required for the second burn decreases faster than the first increases.\n\n== Application to interplanetary travel ==\n\nWhen used to move a spacecraft from orbiting one planet to orbiting another, the situation becomes somewhat more complex, but much less delta-''v'' is required, due to the [[Oberth effect]], than the sum of the delta-''v'' required to escape the first planet plus the delta-''v'' required for a Hohmann transfer to the second planet.\n\nFor example, consider a spacecraft travelling from [[Earth]] to [[Mars]]. At the beginning of its journey, the spacecraft will already have a certain velocity and kinetic energy associated with its orbit around Earth. During the burn the rocket engine applies its delta-''v'', but the kinetic energy increases as a square law, until it is sufficient to [[escape velocity|escape the planet's gravitational potential]], and then burns more so as to gain enough energy to get into the Hohmann transfer orbit (around the [[Sun]]). Because the rocket engine is able to make use of the initial kinetic energy of the propellant, far less delta-''v'' is required over and above that needed to reach escape velocity, and the optimum situation is when the transfer burn is made at minimum altitude (low [[periapsis]]) above the planet. The delta-''v'' needed is only 3.6&nbsp;km/s, only about 0.4&nbsp;km/s more than needed to escape Earth, even though this results in the spacecraft going 2.9&nbsp;km/s faster than the Earth as it heads off for Mars (see table below).\n\nAt the other end, the spacecraft will need a certain velocity to orbit Mars, which will actually be less than the velocity needed to continue orbiting the Sun in the transfer orbit, let alone attempting to orbit the Sun in a Mars-like orbit. Therefore, the spacecraft will have to decelerate in order for the [[gravity of Mars]] to capture it. This capture burn should optimally be done at low altitude to also make best use of Oberth effect. Therefore, relatively small amounts of thrust at either end of the trip are needed to arrange the transfer compared to the free space situation.\n\nHowever, with any Hohmann transfer, the alignment of the two planets in their orbits is crucial &ndash; the destination planet and the spacecraft must arrive at the same point in their respective orbits around the Sun at the same time.  This requirement for alignment gives rise to the concept of [[launch window]]s.\n\nThe term lunar transfer orbit (LTO) is used for the [[Moon]].\n\nIt is possible to apply the formula given above to calculate the \u0394v in km/s needed to enter a Hohmann transfer orbit to arrive at various destinations from Earth (assuming circular orbits for the planets). In this table, the column labeled \"\u0394v to enter Hohmann orbit from Earth's orbit\" gives the change from Earth's velocity to the velocity needed to get on a Hohmann ellipse whose other end will be at the desired distance from the Sun. The column labeled \"v exiting LEO\" gives the velocity needed (in a non-rotating frame of reference centered on the earth) when 300&nbsp;km above the Earth's surface. This is obtained by adding to the specific kinetic energy the square of the speed (7.73&nbsp;km/s) of this low Earth orbit (that is, the depth of Earth's gravity well at this LEO). The column \"\u0394v from LEO\" is simply the previous speed minus 7.73&nbsp;km/s.\n\n{|style=\"text-align:left;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Destination\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Orbital<br>radius<br>([[astronomical unit|AU]])\n! colspan=\"3\" | \u0394v (km/s)\n|-\n! to enter Hohmann orbit<br>from Earth's orbit\n! exiting<br>LEO\n! from<br>LEO\n|-\n| [[Sun]]\n|align=center|0\n|align=center| 29.8\n|align=center| 31.7\n|align=center| 24.0\n|-\n|[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]\n|align=center| 0.39\n|align=center| 7.5\n|align=center| 13.3\n|align=center| 5.5\n|-\n|[[Venus]]\n|align=center| 0.72\n|align=center| 2.5\n|align=center| 11.2\n|align=center| 3.5\n|-\n|[[Mars]]\n|align=center| 1.52\n|align=center| 2.9\n|align=center| 11.3\n|align=center| 3.6\n|-\n|[[Jupiter]]\n|align=center| 5.2\n|align=center| 8.8\n|align=center| 14.0\n|align=center| 6.3\n|-\n|[[Saturn]]\n|align=center| 9.54\n|align=center| 10.3\n|align=center| 15.0\n|align=center| 7.3\n|-\n|[[Uranus]]\n|align=center| 19.19\n|align=center| 11.3\n|align=center| 15.7\n|align=center| 8.0\n|-\n|[[Neptune]]\n|align=center| 30.07\n|align=center| 11.7\n|align=center| 16.0\n|align=center| 8.2\n|-\n|[[Pluto]]\n|align=center| 39.48\n|align=center| 11.8\n|align=center| 16.1\n|align=center| 8.4\n|-\n|[[Infinity]]\n|align=center| \u221e\n|align=center| 12.3\n|align=center| 16.5\n|align=center| 8.8\n|-\n|}\n\nNote that in most cases, \u0394''v'' from LEO is less than the \u0394''v'' to enter Hohmann orbit from Earth's orbit.\n\nTo get to the Sun, it is actually not necessary to use a \u0394''v'' of 24&nbsp;km/s. One can use 8.8&nbsp;km/s to go very far away from the Sun, then use a negligible \u0394''v'' to bring the angular momentum to zero, and then fall into the Sun. This can be considered a sequence of two Hohmann transfers, one up and one down. Also, the table does not give the values that would apply when using the Moon for a [[gravity assist]]. There are also possibilities of using one planet, like Venus which is the easiest to get to, to assist getting to other planets or the Sun.\n\n==Comparison to other transfers==\n\n=== Bi-elliptic transfer ===\n{{main|Bi-elliptic transfer}}\nThe bi-elliptic transfer consists of two half-[[elliptic orbit]]s. From the initial orbit, a first burn expends delta-v to boost the spacecraft into the first transfer orbit with an [[apoapsis]] at some point <math>r_b</math> away from the [[central body]]. At this point a second burn sends the spacecraft into the second elliptical orbit with [[periapsis]] at the radius of the final desired orbit, where a third burn is performed, injecting the spacecraft into the desired orbit.<ref name=\"Curtis\">{{Cite book | last = Curtis | first = Howard | title = Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students | page = 264 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-7506-6169-0 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6aO9aGNBAgIC}}</ref>\n\nWhile they require one more engine burn than a Hohmann transfer and generally require a greater travel time, some bi-elliptic transfers require a lower amount of total delta-v than a Hohmann transfer when the ratio of final to initial [[semi-major axis]] is 11.94 or greater, depending on the intermediate semi-major axis chosen.<ref name=\"Vallado\">{{Cite book | last = Vallado | first = David Anthony | title = Fundamentals of Astrodynamics and Applications | page = 318 | publisher = Springer | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-7923-6903-3 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=PJLlWzMBKjkC&printsec}}</ref>\n\nThe idea of the bi-elliptical transfer trajectory was first{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}<!-- a primary source of Sternfeld's paper does not establish that he was the \"first\" --> published by [[Ary Sternfeld]] in 1934.<ref name=sternfeld1934>\n{{Citation |last=Sternfeld |first=Ary {{sic|J.|expected=A.}} |title=Sur les trajectoires permettant d'approcher d'un corps attractif central \u00e0 partir d'une orbite kepl\u00e9rienne donn\u00e9e |language=French |trans-title=On the allowed trajectories for approaching a central attractive body from a given Keplerian orbit |url=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k31506/f711.image.langEN |journal=Comptes rendus de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences |location=Paris |volume=198 |number=1 |date=1934-02-12 |pages=711\u2013713}}.</ref>\n\n=== Low-thrust transfer ===\n\nLow-thrust engines can perform an approximation of a Hohmann transfer orbit, by creating a gradual enlargement of the initial circular orbit through carefully timed engine firings. This requires a [[Delta-v|change in velocity (delta-''v'')]] that is greater than the two-impulse transfer orbit<ref name=\"MIT_16.522\">MIT, ''16.522: Space Propulsion'', Session 6, \"[https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/aeronautics-and-astronautics/16-522-space-propulsion-spring-2015/lecture-notes/MIT16_522S15_Lecture6.pdf Analytical Approximations for Low Thrust Maneuvers]\", Spring 2015 (retrieved 26 July 2017)\n</ref> and takes longer to complete.\n\nEngines such as [[ion thruster]]s are more difficult to analyze with the delta-''v'' model. These engines offer a very low thrust and at the same time, much higher delta-''v'' budget, much higher [[specific impulse]], lower mass of fuel and engine. A 2-burn Hohmann transfer maneuver would be impractical with such a low thrust; the maneuver mainly optimizes the use of fuel, but in this situation there is relatively plenty of it.\n\nIf only low-thrust maneuvers are planned on a mission, then continuously firing a low-thrust, but very high-efficiency engine might generate a higher delta-''v'' and at the same time use less propellant than a conventional chemical rocket engine.\n\nGoing from one circular orbit to another by gradually changing the radius simply requires the same delta-''v'' as the difference between the two speeds.<ref name=\"MIT_16.522\" /> Such maneuver requires more delta-''v'' than a 2-burn Hohmann transfer maneuver, but does so with continuous low thrust rather than the short applications of high thrust.\n\nThe amount of propellant mass used measures the efficiency of the maneuver plus the hardware employed for it. The total delta-''v'' used measures the efficiency of the maneuver only. For [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion|electric propulsion]] systems, which tend to be low-thrust, the high efficiency of the propulsive system usually compensates for the higher delta-V compared to the more efficient Hohmann maneuver.\n\nTransfer orbit using electrical propulsion or low-thrust engines optimize the transfer time to reach the final orbit and not the delta-v as in the Hohmann transfer orbit. For geostationary orbit, the initial orbit is set to be supersynchronous and by thrusting continuously in the direction of the velocity at apogee, the transfer orbit transforms to a circular geosynchronous one. This method however takes much longer to achieve due to the low thrust injected into the orbit <ref>{{Cite book | last = Spitzer | first = Arnon | title = Optimal Transfer Orbit Trajectory using Electric Propulsion | publisher = [[USPTO]] | date = 1997 | url = http://www.google.com/patents/US5595360}}</ref>\n\n===Interplanetary Transport Network===\n{{main article|Interplanetary Transport Network}}\nIn 1997, a set of orbits known as the Interplanetary Transport Network (ITN) was published, providing even lower propulsive delta-''v'' (though much slower and longer) paths between different orbits than Hohmann transfer orbits.<ref>{{cite web |last1= Lo |first1= M.

A figure in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. In 2020, ''[[NME]]'' named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"<ref name=icon/>\n\nBorn to [[counterculture|countercultural]] parents in [[San Francisco]], Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and was cast in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's [[Pretty on the Inside|1991 debut album]], produced by [[Kim Gordon]]. Hole's second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.\n\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo [[single (music)|singles]] and returned to acting in the network series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''.\n\nLove has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a [[manga]], ''[[Princess Ai]]'', between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]'' (2006).\n\n==Biography==\n===1964\u20131981: Childhood and education===\nCourtney Michelle Harrison{{efn|Some publications have noted that Love was born Love Michelle Harrison, ostensibly based on claims Love made early in her career that she had been born with the first name Love.

(''[[n\u00e9e]]'' '''Harrison'''; born July 9, 1964) is an American singer, songwriter and actress. A figure in the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[grunge]] scenes of the 1990s, Love's career has spanned four decades. She rose to prominence as the [[lead vocalist]] of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989. Love has drawn public attention for her uninhibited live performances and confrontational lyrics, as well as her highly publicized personal life following her marriage to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]]. In 2020, ''[[NME]]'' named her \"one of the most influential singers in alternative culture of the last 30 years.\"<ref name=icon/>\n\nBorn to [[counterculture|countercultural]] parents in [[San Francisco]], Love had an itinerant childhood, but was primarily raised in [[Portland, Oregon]], where she played in a series of short-lived bands and was active in the local punk scene. After briefly being in a juvenile hall, she spent a year living in [[Dublin]] and [[Liverpool]] before returning to the United States and was cast in the [[Alex Cox]] films ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986) and ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987). She formed Hole in Los Angeles, receiving attention from underground rock press for the group's [[Pretty on the Inside|1991 debut album]], produced by [[Kim Gordon]]. Hole's second release, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994), was met with critical accolades and [[RIAA certification|multi-platinum]] sales. In 1995, Love returned to acting, earning a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Golden Globe Award]] nomination for her performance as [[Althea Flynt|Althea Leasure]] in [[Milo\u0161 Forman]]'s ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' (1996), which established her as a mainstream actress. The following year, Hole's third album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998), was nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s.\n\nLove continued to work as an actress into the early 2000s, appearing in big-budget pictures such as ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999) and ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), before releasing her first solo album, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', in 2004. The next years were marked by publicity surrounding Love's legal troubles and [[drug addiction]], which resulted in a mandatory lockdown [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] sentence in 2005 while she was writing a second solo album. That project became ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'', released in 2010 as a Hole album but without the former Hole lineup. Between 2014 and 2015, Love released two solo [[single (music)|singles]] and returned to acting in the network series ''[[Sons of Anarchy]]'' and ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]''.\n\nLove has also been active as a writer; she co-created and co-wrote three volumes of a [[manga]], ''[[Princess Ai]]'', between 2004 and 2006, and wrote a memoir, ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]'' (2006).\n\n==Biography==\n===1964\u20131981: Childhood and education===\nCourtney Michelle Harrison{{efn|Some publications have noted that Love was born Love Michelle Harrison, ostensibly based on claims Love made early in her career that she had been born with the first name Love.

Both teams flitted between the First and Second Divisions in their early years, and neither won a major trophy prior to World War II. The clubs first met in a competitive match in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] on 10 December 1927; Leeds won 5\u20130. Leeds also won 3\u20132 in the return fixture at Stamford Bridge that season to clinch promotion back to [[Football League First Division|Division One]]. In 1952, they contested a gruelling fifth round [[FA Cup]] tie which took three matches to produce a winner, Chelsea eventually prevailed 5\u20131 in a second replay at [[Villa Park]]. An aggregate crowd of almost 150,000 watched the three matches and such was the fearsome tackling on display, Chelsea had to make seven changes to their line-up for a subsequent match.<ref name=\"glanvill\"/>\n\n===1960s===\nIt was in the 1960s that a significant rivalry first emerged between the clubs. Under the management of [[Don Revie]], Leeds became a force in English football for the first time, capped by winning the league title in 1969. Chelsea, too, had enjoyed a renaissance under [[Tommy Docherty]] and also challenged for honours in the 1960s. Over the next decade, they would meet in numerous important, and fiercely contested, matches. Chelsea goalkeeper [[Peter Bonetti]] opined that the rivalry between the teams emerged because \"Leeds had a name, a reputation as being dirty... [and] We matched them in the physical side of things because we had our own players who were physical... We weren't unalike in the way we played.\"<ref name=\"bonetti\" /> [[Tommy Baldwin]] said, \"There were a lot of scores being settled from previous games whenever we played them.

The teams also met in the [[1970 FA Cup Final]], the game which cemented the rivalry.\n\nChelsea and Leeds contested the FA Cup final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] on 11 April 1970.

Both teams flitted between the First and Second Divisions in their early years, and neither won a major trophy prior to World War II. The clubs first met in a competitive match in the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] on 10 December 1927; Leeds won 5\u20130. Leeds also won 3\u20132 in the return fixture at Stamford Bridge that season to clinch promotion back to [[Football League First Division|Division One]]. In 1952, they contested a gruelling fifth round [[FA Cup]] tie which took three matches to produce a winner, Chelsea eventually prevailed 5\u20131 in a second replay at [[Villa Park]]. An aggregate crowd of almost 150,000 watched the three matches and such was the fearsome tackling on display, Chelsea had to make seven changes to their line-up for a subsequent match.<ref name=\"glanvill\"/>\n\n===1960s===\nIt was in the 1960s that a significant rivalry first emerged between the clubs. Under the management of [[Don Revie]], Leeds became a force in English football for the first time, capped by winning the league title in 1969. Chelsea, too, had enjoyed a renaissance under [[Tommy Docherty]] and also challenged for honours in the 1960s. Over the next decade, they would meet in numerous important, and fiercely contested, matches.

The process of crystallization of Israeli sculpture was influenced at every stage by international sculpture. In the early period of Israeli sculpture, most of its important sculptors were immigrants to the Land of Israel, and their art was a [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] of the influence of European sculpture with the way in which the national artistic identity developed in the Land of Israel and later in the State of [[Israel]].\n\nEfforts toward the development of a local style of sculpture began in the late 1930s, with the creation of \"[[Canaanism|Caananite]]\" sculpture, which combined influences from European sculpture with motifs taken from the East, and particularly from [[Mesopotamia]]. These motifs were formulated in national terms and strived to present the relationship between Zionism and the soil of the homeland. In spite of the aspirations of abstract sculpture, which blossomed in Israel in the middle of the 20th century under the influence of the \"New Horizons\" movement and attempted to present sculpture that spoke a universal language, their art included many elements of earlier \"Caananite\" sculpture. In the 1970s, many new elements found their way into Israeli art and sculpture, under the influence of international [[conceptual art]]. These techniques significantly changed the definition of sculpture. In addition, these techniques facilitated the expression of political and social protest, which up to this time had been downplayed in Israeli sculpture.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bezalel Sculpture Class, 1914.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Bezalel sculpture class, 1914]]\nAn attempt to find indigenous 19th-century Israeli sources for the development of \"Israeli\" sculpture is problematic from two points of view.  First, both the artists and Jewish society in the Land of Israel were lacking the national Zionist motifs which would accompany the development of Israeli sculpture in the future.  This applies, of course, also to non-Jewish artists of the same period.  Second, art history research has failed to find a tradition of sculpture either among the Jewish communities of the Land of Israel or among the Arab or Christian residents of that period.  In research conducted by Yitzhak Einhorn, Haviva Peled, and Yona Fischer, artistic traditions of this period were identified, which include ornamental art of a religious (Jewish and Christian) nature, which was created for pilgrims and, therefore, for both export and local needs.  These objects included decorated tablets, embossed soaps, seals, etc. with motifs borrowed for the most part from the tradition of graphic art.<ref>See, Yona Fischer  (Ed.),  Art and Art in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1979).  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nIn his article \"Sources of Israeli Sculpture\"<ref>Gideon Ofrat, Sources of the Land of Israel Sculpture, 1906-1939 (Herzliya: Herzliya Museum, 1990).  [In Hebrew]</ref> [[Gideon Ofrat]] identified the beginning of Israeli sculpture as the founding of the Bezalel School in 1906. At the same time, he identified a problem in trying to present a unified picture of that sculpture. The reasons were the variety of European influences on Israeli sculpture, and the relatively small number of sculptors in Israel, most of whom had worked for long periods in Europe.\n\nAt the same time, even at the Bezalel \u2013 a school of art founded by a sculptor \u2013 sculpture was considered a lesser art, and the studies there concentrated on the art of painting and the crafts of graphic and design.  Even in the \"New Bezalel\", founded in 1935, Sculpture did not occupy a significant place. While it is true that a department of sculpture was set up in the new school, it closed a year later, because it was viewed as a tool to help students learn three-dimensional design and not as an independent department. In its place a department of pottery<ref>See, Gideon Efrat, The New Bezalel, 1935-1955 (Jerusalem: Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, 1987)  pp. 128-130.  [In Hebrew]</ref> opened and flourished. There were exhibitions by individual sculptors during these years both in the Bezalel Museum and in the Tel Aviv Museum, but these were exceptions and were not indicative of the general attitude toward three-dimensional art. An ambiguous attitude toward sculpture by the artistic establishment could be felt, in various incarnations, well into the 1960s.\n\n===Early sculpture in the Land of Israel===\n\n[[File:Shatz herzel.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Boris Schatz]] sculpts the figure of [[Theodor Herzl]]]]\n[[File:Bikur Cholim Hospital doors 004-2.jpg|250px|right|thumb|\"[[Tribe of Issachar]]\" by [[Ze'ev Raban]], detail from a brass door at [[Bikur Cholim Hospital]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n[[File:Judah Arising2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Awakening Judah (1925) by [[Abraham Melnikoff]]. [[Ramat Gan National Park]], [[Ramat Gan]]]]\nThe beginning of sculpture in the Land of Israel, and of Israeli art in general, is usually designated as 1906, the year of the founding of the Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts in Jerusalem by [[Boris Schatz]]. Schatz, who studied sculpture in Paris with [[Mark Antokolski]], was already a well-known sculptor when he arrived in Jerusalem.  He specialized in relief portraiture of Jewish subjects in an academic style.\n\nSchatz's work attempted to establish a new Jewish-Zionist identity He expressed this by using figures from the Bible within a framework derived from European Christian culture. His work \"Matthew the Hasmoneum\" (1894), for example, depicted the Jewish national hero [[Mattathias|Mattathias ben Johanan]] grasping a sword and with his foot on the body of a Greek soldier. This kind of representation is connected to the ideological theme of \"The Victory of Good Over Evil\", as expressed, for example, in the figure of Perseus in a sculpture from the 15th century.<ref>See, Alec Mishory, Behold, Gaze, and See (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2000) pp. 53\u201355. [In Hebrew]</ref> Even a series of memorial plaques Schatz created for the leaders of the Jewish settlement is derived from Classical art, combined with the descriptive tradition in the spirit of the Ars Novo tradition. The influence of Classical and [[Renaissance art]] on Schatz can be seen even in the copies of sculptures he ordered for Bezalel, which he displayed in the Bezalel Museum as examples of ideal sculpture for the students in the school. These sculptures include \"[[David (Verrocchio)|David]]\" (1473\u20131475) and \"Putto with a Dolphin\" (1470) by [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].<ref>] See, Alec Mishory, Behold, Gaze, and See (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2000) p. 51. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nThe studies at Bezalel tended to favor painting, drawing, and design, and as a result the amount of three-dimensional sculpture turned out there was limited. Among the few workshops which opened at the school was one in [[woodcarving]], in which reliefs of various Zionist and Jewish leaders were produced, along with workshops in decorative design in applied art using techniques such as hammering copper into thin sheets, setting gems, etc. In 1912 a department for [[ivory]] design, which also emphasized the applied arts, was opened.<ref>Nurit Shilo-Cohen, Schatz\u2019s Bezalel  (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1983) pp. 55\u201368.  [In Hebrew]</ref> In the course of its activities workshops were added that functioned nearly autonomously. In a memo issued in June 1924, Schatz outlined all of the major fields of activity of Bezalel, among them stone sculpture, which was founded primarily by students of the school within the framework of the \"Jewish Legion\" and the workshop on woodcarving.<ref>] Nurit Shilo-Cohen, Schatz\u2019s Bezalel  (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1983) p.98.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nBesides Schatz, there were several other artists in Jerusalem in the early days of Bezalel who were working in the field of sculpture. In 1912 [[Ze'ev Raban]] immigrated to the Land of Israel at Schatz's invitation and served as an instructor in sculpture, sheet copper work, and anatomy at Bezalel. Raban had trained in sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, and later at the [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]] and the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Antwerp]], Belgium. In addition to his well-known graphic work, Raban created figurative sculptures and reliefs in the academic \"Oriental\" style, such as the terracotta figurine of the Biblical figures \"Eli and Samuel\" (1914), who are depicted as Yemenite Jews.  However Raban's most important work focused on embossments for jewelry and other decorative items.<ref>About the jewelry design of Raban, see Yael Gilat, \u201cThe Ben Shemen Jewelers\u2019 Community, Pioneer in the Work-at-Home Industry: From the Resurrection of the Spirit of the Botega to the Resurrection of the Guilds,\u201d in Art and Crafts, Linkages, and Borders, edited by Nurit Canaan Kedar, (Tel Aviv: The Yolanda and David Katz Art Faculty, Tel Aviv University, 2003), 127\u2013144. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nOther instructors at Bezalel also created sculptures in the realistic academic style. [[Eliezer Strich]], for instance, created busts of people in the Jewish settlement. Another artist, [[Yitzhak Sirkin]] carved portraits in wood and in stone.\n\nThe main contribution to Israel sculpture of this period can be contributed to Abraham Melnikoff, who worked outside the framework of Bezalel. Melnikoff created his first work in Israel in 1919, after he arrived in the Land of Israel during his service in the \"[[Jewish Legion]]\". Until the 1930s, Melnikoff produced a series of sculptures in various kinds of stone, mostly portraiture done in [[terracotta]] and stylized images carved out of stone. Among his significant works is a group of symbolic sculptures depicting the awakening of the Jewish identity, such as \"The Awakening Judah\" (1925), or memorial monuments to [[Ahad Ha'am]] (1928) and to [[Max Nordau]] (1928). In addition, Melnikoff presided over presentations of his works in exhibits of Artists of the Land of Israel in the [[Tower of David]].\n\nThe \"Roaring Lion\" monument (1928\u20131932) is a continuation of this trend, but this sculpture is different in the way it was perceived by the Jewish public of that period.  Melnikoff himself initiated the building of the monument, and funding for the project was attained jointly by the Histadrut ha-Clalit, the Jewish National Council, and [[Alfred Mond]] (Lord Melchett). The image of the monumental [[lion]], sculpted in granite, was influenced by primitive art combined with Mesopotamian art of the 7th and 8th centuries A.D.<ref>Haim Gamzo compared the sculpture to the image of the Assyrian lion from Khorsabad, found in the collection of the Louvre.  See Haim Gamzo, The Art of Sculpture in Israel (Tel Aviv: Mikhlol Publishing House Ltd., 1946) (without page numbers). [In Hebrew]</ref> The style is expressed primarily in the anatomical design of the figure.\n\n[[File:Zaid1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alexander Za\u00efd monument by [[David Polus]]]]\n[[File:Zeev ben-zvi-meskin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Aharon Meskin]] by [[Zeev Ben-Zvi]]]]\nThe sculptors who started to produce works at the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s in the Land of Israel demonstrated a wide variety of influences and styles. Among them were a few who went by the teachings of the Bezalel School, while others, who arrived after studying in Europe, brought with them the influence of early French Modernism on art, or the influence of Expressionism, especially in its German form.\n\nAmong the sculptors who were Bezalel students, the works of [[Aaron Priver]] stand out. Priver arrived in the Land of Israel in 1926 and began to study sculpture with Melnikoff. His work displayed a combination of a tendency toward realism and an archaic or moderately primitive style. His feminine figures of the 1930s are designed with rounded lines and sketchy facial features. Another pupil, [[Nachum Gutman]], better known for his paintings and drawings, traveled to [[Vienna]] in 1920, and later went to [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]], where he studied sculpture and printmaking and produced sculptures on a small scale which show traces of expressionism and a tendency toward a \"primitive\" style in the depiction of its subjects.\n\nThe works of [[David Ozeransky]] (Agam) continued the decorative tradition of [[Ze'ev Raban]].  Ozeransky even worked as a laborer on the sculptural decorations Raban created for the YMCA building in Jerusalem. Ozeransky's most important work of this period is \"Ten Tribes\" (1932) \u2013 a group of ten square decorative tablets, which describe in symbolic terms the ten cultures associated with the history of the Land of Israel. Another work that Ozeranzky was involved in creating during this period was \"The Lion\" (1935) that stands atop the Generali Building in Jerusalem.<ref>see: Yael Gilat, Artists Write the Myth Again: Alexander Zaid\u2019s Memorial and the Works That Followed in its Footsteps, Oranim Academic College Website [In Hebrew]    <http://info.oranim.ac.il/home/home.exe/16737/23928?load=T.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000305/http://info.oranim.ac.il/home/home.exe/16737/23928?load=T.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}></ref>\n\nAlthough he was never a student at the institution, the work of [[David Polus]] was anchored in the Jewish academism which Schatz formulated at Bezalel. Polus began to sculpt after he was a stonemason in the labor corps. His first significant work was a statue of \"David the Shepherd\" (1936\u20131938) in [[Ramat David]]. In his monumental work 1940 \"[[Alexander Zeid|Alexander Zeid Memorial]]\", which was cast in concrete at \"Sheik Abreik\" and stands near the [[Beit She'arim]] National Park, Polus represents the man known as \"The Watchman\"  as a horseman looking out over the view of the Jezreel Valley. In 1940 Polus placed at the base of the monument two tablets, in archaic-symbolic style, whose subjects were \"the thicket\" and \"the shepherd.\"<ref>Yael Gilat, Artists Write the Myth Again: Alexander Zaid\u2019s Memorial and the Works That Followed in its Footsteps, Oranim Academic College Website [In Hebrew]</ref>  While the style of the main statue  is realistic, it became known for its attempt to glorify its subject and emphasize his connection with the land.\n\nIn 1910 the sculptress [[Chana Orloff]] emigrated from the Land of Israel to France and began studies in the [[\u00c9cole Nationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]]. Her work, beginning with the period of her studies, emphasizes her connection to French art of the time. Particularly evident is the influence of Cubist sculpture, which moderated in her work with the passage of time. Her sculptures, mostly human images carved in stone and wood, designed as geometric spaces and flowing lines. A significant portion of her work is devoted to sculptural portraits of figures from French society.<ref>See Haim Gamzo, Chana Orloff (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1968). [In Hebrew]</ref> Her connection with the Land of Israel, Orloff preserved through an exhibition of her works in the Tel Aviv Museum.<ref>] Her museum exhibitions during those years took place in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 1935, and in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Haifa Museum of Art in 1949.</ref>\n\nAnother sculptor who was greatly influenced by Cubism is Zeev Ben Zvi.  In 1928, after his studies in Bezalel, Ben Zvi went to study in Paris.  Upon his return, he served for short periods as an instructor in sculpture at Bezalel and at the \"New Bezalel.\"  In 1932 his first exhibition was held at the Bezalel national antiquities museum, and a year later he mounted an exhibition of his works at the Tel Aviv Museum.  His sculpture \"The Pioneer\" was displayed at the Orient Fair in Tel Aviv in 1934.  In Ben Zvi's work, as in Orloff's, the language of the Cubists, the language in which he designed his sculptures, did not abandon realism and stayed within the boundaries of traditional sculpture.<ref>Haim Gamzo, The Sculptor Ben-Zvi (Tel Aviv: HaZvi Publications, 1955). [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nThe influence of French realism can also be seen in the group of Israeli artists who were influenced by the realistic trend of early twentieth-century French sculptors like [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Aristide Maillol]], etc. The symbolic baggage of both their content and their style showed up as well in the work of Israeli artists, such as [[Moses Sternschuss]], [[Raphael Chamizer]], [[Moshe Ziffer]], [[Joseph Constant]] (Constantinovsky), and [[Dov Feigin]], most of whom studied sculpture in France.\n\nOne of this group of artists \u2013 Batya Lishanski \u2013 studied painting in Bezalel, and took courses in sculpture in the Parisian [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]]. When she returned to Israel, she created figurative and expressive sculpture, which showed the clear influence of Rodin, who emphasized the corporeality of his sculptures. The series of monuments that Lishanski created, the first of which was \"Labor and Defense\" (1929),  which was built over the grave of [[Ephraim Chisik]] - who died in the battle for the Hulda Farm (today, Kibbutz [[Hulda, Israel|Hulda]]) - as a reflection of the Zionist utopia during that period: a combination of the redemption of the land and the defense of the homeland.\n\nThe influence of German art and particularly of German expressionism can be seen in the group of artists who arrived in the Land of Israel after receiving their training in art in various German cities and in Vienna.  Artists such as [[Jacob Brandenburg]], [[Trude Chaim]], and [[Lili Gompretz-Beatus]], and George Leshnitzer produced figurative sculpture, primarily portraiture, designed in a style that wavered between impressionism and moderate  expressionism.  Among the artists of that group [[Rudi Lehmann|Rudolf (Rudi) Lehmann]], who started teaching art in a studio he opened in the 1930s, stands out.  Lehmann had studied sculpture and wood carving with a German named L. Feurdermeier, who specialized in animal sculptures. The figures that Lehmann created  showed the influence of expressionism  in the gross design of the body, which emphasized the material from which the sculpture was made and the way the sculptor worked on it. In spite of the overall appreciation of his work, Lehmann's primary importance was as a teacher of the methods of classical sculpture, in stone and wood, to a large number of Israeli artists.\n\n===Canaanite to abstract, 1939\u20131967===\n\n[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Nimrod (1939) by [[Itzhak Danziger]]]]\n[[File:The Firs Ones.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The First Ones (1958) by [[Shoshanna Heimann]]]]\n[[File:Amos kenan.JPG|thumb|right|250px|\"Messiah\" (1966) by [[Amos Kenan]]. Tefen Sculpture Garden]]\nAt the end of the 1930s, a group called \"[[Canaanism|The Canaanites]]\" \u2013 a broad sculptural movement, primarily literary in nature \u2013 was founded in Israel. This group tried to create a direct line between the early peoples living in the Land of Israel, in the second millennium before the Christian Era, and the Jewish people in the Land of Israel in the 20th century, at the same time striving toward the creation of a new-old culture which would separate itself from Jewish tradition. The artist most closely associated with this movement was the sculptor [[Itzhak Danziger]], who returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying art in [[England]]. The new nationalism that Danziger's \"Canaanite\" art suggested, a nationalism that was anti-European and full of Eastern sensuality and exoticism, reflected the attitude of many of the people living in the Jewish community in the Land of Israel. \"The dream of Danziger's generation\", [[Amos Keinan]] wrote after Danziger's death, was \"to merge with the Land of Israel and with the land, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and imprint the stamp of that something special that is us on history.<ref>Amos Kenan, \u201cGreater Israel,\u201d Yedioth Ahronoth, 19 August 1977. [In Hebrew]</ref> Aside from nationalism, the artists created sculpture which expressed a symbolic expressionism in the spirit of British sculpture of the same period.\n\nIn Tel Aviv Danziger  founded a sculpture studio in the courtyard of his father's hospital, and there he critiqued and taught young sculptors such as [[Benjamin Tammuz]], [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Yehiel Shemi]], [[Mordechai Gumpel]], and others.<ref>] The Story of Israeli Art, Benjamin Tammuz, Editor (Jerusalem: Masada Publishing House, 1980), p. 134. [In Hebrew]</ref>  In addition to Danziger's pupils, the studio became a gathering place for artists in other fields.  In this studio Danziger created his first significant works \u2013 \"Nimrod\" (1939) and \"Shebaziya\" (1939).\n\nFrom the moment it was first displayed, the statue \"Nimrod\" became the center of a dispute in the culture of Eretz Israel; in this sculpture Danziger presented the figure of [[Nimrod]], the biblical hunter, as a lean youth, naked and uncircumcised, with a sword pressed close to his body, and a falcon on his shoulder. The form of the statue was reminiscent of the primitive art of the Assyrian, Egyptian, and Greek cultures, and similar in spirit to European sculpture of this period. In its form the statue displayed a unique combination of [[homoerotic]] beauty and pagan idol worship. This combination was at the center of the criticism of the religious community in the Jewish settlement. At the same time other voices declared it the model for the 'new Jewish man'. In 1942 an article appeared in the newspaper \"HaBoker\" declaring that \"Nimrod is not just a sculpture, it is the flesh of our flesh, the spirit of our spirit. It is a milestone and a monument. It is the epitome of ingenuity and daring, of monumentality, of the youthful rebellion that characterizes an entire generation...Nimrod will be forever young.\"<ref>Cited in: Sara Breitberg Semel, \u201cAgripas vs. Nimrod,\u201d Kav, No. 9 (1999). [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nThe first showing of the sculpture in the \"General Exhibition of the Young People of Eretz Israel\", in [[Habima Theatre]] in May, 1942<ref>] This exhibition is dated according to Gamzo\u2019s critique, which was published on May 2, 1944.</ref> engendered the persistent argument over the \"Canaanite\"  movement. Because of the exhibition, [[Yonatan Ratosh]], founder of the movement, got in touch with him and requested a meeting with him.  The criticism against \"Nimrod\" and the Canaanites was coming not just from religious elements who, as mentioned above, protested against this representative of the pagan and the idolatrous, but also from secular critics who condemned the removal of everything \"Jewish\". To a large extent, \"Nimrod\" ended up in the middle of a dispute that had been started long before.\n\nIn spite of the fact that Danziger later expressed doubts about \"Nimrod\" as a model for Israeli culture, many other artists adopted the Canaanite approach to sculpture. Images of idols and figures in the \"primitive\" style showed up in Israeli art until the 1970s. In addition, the influence of this group can be seen to a significant degree in the work of the \"New Horizons\" group, most of whose members experimented with the Canaanite style early in their artistic careers.\n\n===\"New Horizons\" group===\n{{main|New Horizons (art movement)}}\n[[File:Feigin ein harod.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Growth (1959) by [[Dov Feigin]]. Museum of Art, Ein Harod]]\n[[File:The Burning Bush (1959) by Ithak Danziger.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Burning Bush (1959) by [[Yitzhak Danziger]]]]\n[[File:Achziv Pesel-Yam21.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pesel Yam (1964\u20137) by [[Yehiel Shemi]], Achziv beach]]\n\nIn 1948, a movement called \"[[New Horizons (art movement)|New Horizons]]\" (\"Ofakim Hadashim\") was founded. It identified with the values of European modernism, and particularly with abstract art. [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Moshe Sternschuss]], and [[Dov Feigin]] were appointed to the group of founders of the movement, and were later joined by other sculptors. The Israeli sculptors were perceived as a minority not only because of the small number of them in the movement, but primarily because of the dominance of the medium of painting in the view of the leaders of the movement, especially [[Joseph Zaritsky]]. In spite of the fact that most of the sculptures of members of the group were not \"pure\" abstract sculpture, they included elements of abstract art and metaphysical symbolism.  Non-abstract art was perceived as old-fashioned and irrelevant. Sternschuss, for example, described the pressure that was put upon members of the group not to include figurative  elements in their art. It was a long struggle that began in 1959, the year that was considered by members of the group as the year of \"the victory of abstraction\"<ref>Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10.  [In Hebrew]</ref> and reached its peak in the mid-1960s. Sternschuss even told a story about an incident in which one of the artists wanted to display a sculpture that was considerably more avante-garde than what was generally accepted.  But it had a head, and because of this, one of the members of the board testified against him on this issue.<ref>On the subject of kibbutz pressure, see Gila Blass, New Horizons (Tel Aviv: Papyrus and Reshefim Publishers, 1980), pp. 59\u201360. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nGideon Ophrat, in his essay on the group, found a strong connection between the painting and sculpture of \"New Horizons\" and the art of the \"Caananites.\"<ref>See Gideon Ophrat, \u201cThe Secret Canaanism in \u2018New Horizons\u2019,\u201d Art Visits [Bikurei omanut], 2005.</ref> In spite of the \"international\" hue of the artistic forms that the members of the group exhibited, many of their works showed a mythological depiction of the Israeli landscape. In December 1962, for example, Kosso Eloul organized an international symposium on sculpture in [[Mitzpe Ramon]]. This event  served as an example of the growing interest of the sculptures in the Israeli landscape, and in particular in the desolate desert landscape. The landscape was perceived, on the one hand, as the basis for the thought processes for creating many monuments and memorial sculptures. [[Yona Fisher]] speculated, in his research on art in the 1960s, that the interest of sculptors in the \"magic of the desert\" arose not just from a romantic yearning for nature, but also from an attempt to inculcate in Israel an environment of \"Culture\" rather than \"Civilization\".<ref>] Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now  (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), pp. 30\u201331.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nThe test with regard to the works of each member of the group lay in the different way he dealt with abstraction and with landscape.  The crystallization of the abstract nature of Dov Feigin's sculpture, was part of a process of an artistic search that was influenced by international sculpture, particularly that of [[Julio Gonz\u00e1lez (sculptor)|Julio Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]], and [[Alexander Calder]]. The most important artistic change took place in 1956, when Feigin changed over to metal (iron) sculpture.<ref>See: L. Orgad, Dov Feigin (Tel Aviv: The Kibbutz  HaMeuhad [The United Kibbutz], 1988), pp. 17\u201319. [In Hebrew]</ref> His works from this year onward, such as \"Bird\" and \"Flight\" were constructed by welding together strips of iron which were placed in compositions full of dynamism and movement. The transition from linear sculpture to planar sculpture, using cut and bent copper or iron, was a process of natural development for Feigin, who was influenced by the works of [[Pablo]] Picasso done using a similar technique.\n\nIn contrast to Feigin, Moshe Sternschuss shows a more gradual development in his move toward abstraction. After finishing his studies at Bezalel, Sternschuss went to study in Paris.  In 1934 he returned to Tel Aviv and was among the founders of the Avni Institute ofArt and Design.  Sternschuss' sculptures during that period displayed an academic modernism, although they were lacking the Zionist features present in art of the Bezalel School. Beginning in the middle of the 1940s, his human figures displayed a marked tendency toward abstraction, as well as a growing use of geometric forms. One of the first of these sculptures was \"Dance\" (1944),  which was displayed in an exhibition next to \"Nimrod\" in this year. Actually, Sternschuss' work never became completely abstract, but continued to deal with the human figure by non-figurative means.<ref>See: Irit Hadar, Moses Sternschuss  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2001).  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nWhen Itzhak Danziger returned to Israel in 1955, he joined \"New Horizons\" and began making metal sculptures. The style of the sculptures he developed was influenced by constructivist art, which was expressed in its abstract forms. Nonetheless, much of the subject matter of his sculptures was clearly local, as in sculptures with names associated with the Bible, such as \"Horns of Hattin\" (1956), the place of Saladin's victory over the crusaders in 1187, and The Burning Bush (1957), or with places in Israel, such as \"Ein Gedi\" (1950s), \"Sheep of the Negev\" (1963), etc. To a considerable extent this combination characterized the works of many of the artists of the movement.<ref>] A similar analysis of the narrative of Israeli sculpture appears in Gideon Ophrat\u2019s article, \u201cThe Secret Canaanism\u201d in \u2018New Horizons\u2019,\u201d Studio, No. 2 (August, 1989). [In Hebrew]  The article appears also in his book, With Their Backs to the Sea: Images of Place in Israeli Art and Literature, Israeli Art (Israeli Art Publishing House, 1990), pp. 322\u2013330.</ref>\n\n[[Yechiel Shemi]], also one of Danziger's pupils, moved to metal sculpture in 1955 for a practical reason. This move facilitated the move to abstraction in his work. His works, which made use of the technique of soldering, welding, and hammering into thin strips, was one of the first sculptors from this group that worked with these techniques.26  In works such as \"Mythos\"  (1956) Shemi's connection with the \"Caananite\" art from which he developed can still be seen, but soon after he eliminated all identifiable signs of figurative art from his work.\n\nIsraeli-born [[Ruth Tzarfati]] studied sculpture in Avni's studio with Moses Sternschuss, who became her husband. In spite of the stylistic and social closeness between Zarfati and the \"New Horizons\" artists, her sculpture shows overtones that are independent from the rest of the members of the group.  This is expressed primarily in her display of figurative sculpture with curved lines. Her sculpture \"She Sits\" (1953), depicts an unidentified female figure, using lines characteristics of European expressive sculpture, such as the sculpture of Henry Moore. Another group of sculpture, \"Baby Girl\" (1959) shows a group of children and babies designed as dolls in grotesque expressive poses.\n\n[[David Palombo]]\u00a0(1920 \u2013 1966) realised a number of powerful, abstract iron sculptures before his early death.<ref name=\"Palombo\">[https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/plimbo_eng.htm David Palombo], on the [[Knesset]] website, accessed 16 October 2019</ref> Palombo's sculptures from the 1960s can be considered to express Holocaust memories through \"the sculptural aesthetics of fire\".<ref>{{cite web |author= Gideon Ofrat |title= Aharon Bezalel |work= Aharon Bezalel sculptures |url= http://www.aharonbezalel.com/gideon-ofrat.html |quote= Indeed, the sculptural aesthetics of fire, bearing memories of the Holocaust (at that time finding their principal expression in the sculptures of Palombo).... |access-date= 16 October 2019 </ref>\n\n===Sculpture of protest===\n[[File:He Walked through the Fields.jpg|thumb|right|250px|He Walked through the Fields (1967) by Yigal Tumarkin]]\nIn the early 1960s, American influences, particularly abstract expressionism, pop art, and somewhat later, conceptual art, began to appear in Israeli art. In addition to new artistic forms, [[pop art]] and conceptual art brought with them a direct connection to the political and social realities of the time. In contrast, the central trend in Israeli art was towards a preoccupation with the personal and the artistic, ignoring to a large extent a discussion of the Israeli political landscape. Artists who concerned themselves with social or Jewish issues were looked on by the artistic establishment as anarchists.<ref>See: Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 76.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nOne of the first artists whose works expressed not only international artistic influences, but also the tendency to deal with current political issues, was [[Yigal Tumarkin]], who returned to Israel in 1961, at  the encouragement of Yona Fischer and Sam Dubiner, from East Berlin, where he had been the set manager of the Berliner Ensemble theater company, under the direction of Berthold Brecht.<ref>Igael Tumarkin, \u201cDanziger in the Eyes of Igael Tumarkin,\u201d Studio, No. 76 (October\u2013November 1996), pp. 21\u201323. [In Hebrew]</ref> His early sculptures were created as expressive assemblages, put together from parts of various kinds of weapons.  His sculpture \"Take Me Under Your Wings\"(1964\u201365), for example, Tumarkin created a sort of steel casing with rifle barrels sticking out of it. The mixture that we see in this sculpture of the nationalistic dimension and the lyric, and even erotic, dimension, was to become a striking element in Tumarkin's political art in the 1970s.<ref>Ginton, Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), p. 28.  [In Hebrew]</ref> A similar approach can be seen in his famous sculpture \"He Walked in the Fields\" (1967) (the same name as [[Moshe Shamir]]'s famous story), which protested against the image of the \"mythological Sabra\"; Tumarkin strips off his \"skin\" and exposes his torn innards from which weapons and ammunition protrude and his stomach, which contains a round bomb that looks suspiciously like a uterus. During the 1970s Tumarkin's art evolved to include new materials influenced by \"[[Land art]],\" such as dirt, tree branches, and pieces of cloth.  In this way, Tumarkin sought to sharpen the focus of his political protest against what he saw as the one-sided approach of Israeli society toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War Israeli art began to demonstrate other expressions of protest than those of Tumarkin.  At the same time, these works did not look like conventional works of sculpture, made of wood or metal.  The main reason for this was the influence of various kinds of avant-garde art, which developed for the most part in the United States and influenced young Israeli artists.  The spirit of this influence could be seen in a tendency toward active artistic works that blurred both the boundaries between the different fields of art and the separation of the artist from social and political life.  The sculpture of this period was no longer perceived as an independent artistic object, but rather as an inherent expression of physical and social space.\n\n===Landscape sculpture in conceptual art===\n\nAnother aspect of these trends was the growing interest in the boundless Israeli landscape. These works were influenced by [[Land Art]] and a combination of the dialectical relationship between the \"Israeli\" landscape and the \"Eastern\" landscape. In many works with ritualistic and metaphysical traits, the development or direct influence of the Canaanite artists or sculptors can be seen, along with the abstraction of \"New Horizons\", in the various relationships with the landscape.\n\nOne of the first projects in Israel under the banner of conceptual art was carried out by [[Joshua Neustein]]. In 1970 Neustein, collaborated with [[Georgette Batlle]] and [[Gerry Marx]] on \"Jerusalem River Project\".  For this project speakers installed across a desert valley played looped sounds of a river in East Jerusalem, in the foothills of [[Abu Tor]] and Saint Claire's Convent, and all the way to the [[Kidron Valley]]. This imaginary river not only created an extraterritorial museum atmosphere, but also hinted in an ironic way at the feeling of messianic redemption after the Six Day War, in the spirit of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] (Chapter 47) and the [[Book of Zechariah]] (Chapter  14).<ref>Ginton, Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 32\u201336.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\n[[Yitzhak Danziger]], whose works had begun portraying the local landscape several years earlier, expressed the conceptual aspect in a style he developed as a distinctive Israeli variation of Land Art. Danziger felt that there was a need for reconciliation and improvement in the damaged relationship between man and his environment. This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture. In 1971, Danziger presented his project \"Hanging Nature\", in a collaborative project in The [[Israel Museum]]. The work was composed of hanging fabric on which was a mixture of colors, plastic emulsion, cellulose fibers, and chemical fertilizer, on which Danziger was growing grass using a system of artificial light and irrigation. Next to the fabric, slides showing the destruction of nature by modern industrialization were screened. The exhibition requested the creation of an ecology unity, which would exist as \"art\" and as \"nature\" simultaneously.<ref>Yona Fischer , in: Itzhak Danziger,  Place (Tel Aviv: Ha Kibbutz HaMeuhad Publishing House, 1982. (The article is untitled and preceded by the following quotation: \u201cArt precedes science.\u201d  The pages in the book are unnumbered).  [In Hebrew]</ref> The \"repair\" of the landscape as an artistic event was developed by Danziger in his project \"The Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry\", on the northern slopes of [[Mount Carmel]]. This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, [[Zeev Naveh]] the ecologist, and [[Joseph Morin (researcher)|Joseph Morin]] the soil researcher.  In this project, which was never finished, they attempted to create, using various technological and ecological means, a new environment among the fragments of stone left in the quarry.  \"Nature should not be returned to its natural state,\" Danziger contended. \"A system needs to be found to re-use the nature which has been created as material for an entirely new concept.\"<ref>From \"Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry, Israel Museum, 1972, \" in: Yona Fischer, in Itzhak Danziger,  Place (Tel Aviv: Ha Kibbutz HaMeuhad Publishing House, 1982. [In Hebrew]</ref> After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum.\n\nIn 1973 Danziger began to collect material for a book that would document his work.  Within the framework of the preparation for the book, he documented places of archaeological and contemporary ritual in Israel, places which had become the sources of inspiration for his work. The book, ''Makom'' (in [[Hebrew]] - ''place''), was published in 1982, after Danziger's death, and presented photographs of these places along with Danziger's sculptures, exercises in design,  sketches of his works and ecological ideas, displayed as \"sculpture\" with the values of abstract art, such as collecting rainwater, etc.  One of the places documented in the book is Bustan Hayat  [could not confirm English spelling-sl ] at Nachal Siach in Haifa, which was built by Aziz Hayat in 1936. Within the framework of classes he gave at the Technion, Danziger conducted experiments in design with his students, involving them also with the care and upkeep of the Bustan.\n\nIn 1977 a planting ceremony was conducted in the [[Golan Heights]] for 350 Oak saplings, being planted as a memorial to the fallen soldiers of the Egoz Unit.  Danziger, who was serving as a judge in \"the competition for the planning and implementation of the memorial to the Northern Commando Unit,\" suggested that instead of a memorial sculpture, they put their emphasis on the landscape itself, and on a site that would be different from the usual memorial. \u201dWe felt that any vertical structure, even the most impressive, could not compete with the mountain range itself. When we started climbing up to the site, we discovered that the rocks, that looked from a distance like texture, had a personality all of their own up close.\"<ref>Itzhak Danziger, The Project for the Memorial to the Fallen Soldiers of the Egoz Commando Unit.  [In Hebrew]</ref> This perception derived from research in Bedouin and Palestinian ritual sites in the Land of Israel,  sites in which the trees serve both as a symbol next to the graves of saints and as a ritual focus, \"on which they hang colorful shiny blue and green fabrics from the oaks [...]  People go out to hang these fabrics because of a spiritual need, they go out to make a wish.\"<ref>] Amnon Barzel, \u201cLandscape as an Artistic Creation\u201d (Interview with Itzhak Danziger), Haaretz (July 27, 1977). [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nIn 1972 group of young artists who were in touch with Danziger and influenced by his ideas created a group of activities that became known as \"Metzer-Messer\"  in the area between [[Kibbutz]] [[Metzer]] and the Arab village [[Meiser]] in the north west section of the Shomron. [[Micha Ullman]], with the help of youth from both the kibbutz and the village, dug a hole in each of the communities and implemented an exchange of symbolic red soil between them. [[Moshe Gershuni]] called a meeting of the kibbutz members and handed out the soil of Kibbutz Metzer to them there, and [[Avital Geva]] created in the area between the two communities an improvised library of books recycled from Amnir Recycling Industries.<ref>See: Ginton Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 88\u201389.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nAnother artist influenced by Danziger's ideas was [[Yigal Tumarkin]], who at the end of the 1970s, created a series of works entitled, \"Definitions of Olive Trees and Oaks,\" in which he created temporary sculpture around trees. Like Danziger, Tumarkin also related in these works to the life forms of popular culture, particularly in Arab and Bedouin villages, and created from them a sort of artistic-morphological language, using \"impoverished\" bricolage methods.  Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture.   In works such as \"Earth Crucifixion\" (1981) and \"Bedouin Crucifixion\" (1982), Tumarkin referred to the ejection of Palestinians and Bedouins from their lands, and created \"crucifixion pillars\" for these lands.<ref>Yigal Zalmona, Onward: The East in Israeli Art (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1998), pp. 82\u201383.  For documentation of much of Danziger\u2019s sculptural activity, see Igael Tumarkin, Trees, Stones, and Fabrics in the Wind (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1981. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nAnother group that operated in a similar spirit, while at the same time emphasizing Jewish metaphysics, was the group known as the \"Leviathians,\" presided over by Avraham Ofek, Michail Grobman, and Shmuel Ackerman.  The group combined conceptual art and \"land art\" with Jewish symbolism.  Of the three of them, Avraham Ofek had the deepest interest in sculpture and its relationship to religious symbolism and images.  In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures.  In his work \"Letters of Light\" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert.   In another work Ofek screened the words \"America,\" \"Africa,\" and \"Green card\" on the walls of the Tel Hai courtyard during a symposium on sculpture.<ref>] See: The Story of Israeli Art, Benjamin Tammuz, Editor (Jerusalem: Masada Publishing House, 1980), pp. 238\u2013240.  Also Gideon Efrat, Abraham Ofek House (Kibbutz Ein Harod, Haim Atar Museum of Art, 1986), primarily pp. 136\u2013148.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\n===Abstract sculpture===\n[[File:Menashe Kadishman 001.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Uprise (1967\u20131976) by [[Menashe Kadishman]]]]\n[[File:Kikar Levana0047.JPG|thumb|right|250px|White Square (1989) by [[Dani Karavan]]]]\n[[File:Dead Sea Sculpture1986.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Dead Sea Sculpture (1986) by [[Buky Schwartz]]]]\nAt the beginning of the 1960s [[Menashe Kadishman]] arrived on the scene of abstract sculpture while he was studying in [[London]]. The artistic style he developed in those years was heavily influenced by English art of this period, such as the works of Anthony Caro, who was one of his teachers. At the same time his work was permeated by the relationship between landscape and ritual objects, like Danziger and other Israeli sculptors. During his stay in Europe, Kadishman created a number of totemic images of people, gates, and altars of a talismanic and primitive nature.<ref>] Pierre Restany, Kadishman (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1996), pp. 43-48. [In Hebrew]</ref> Some of these works, such as \"Suspense\" (1966), or \"Uprise\" (1967\u20131976), developed into pure geometric figures.\n\nAt the end of this decade, in works such as \"Aqueduct\" (1968\u20131970) or \"Segments\" (1969), Kadishman combined pieces of glass separating chunks of stone with a tension of form between the different parts of the sculpture.  With his return to Israel at the beginning of the 1970s, Kadishman began to create works that were clearly in the spirit of \"Land Art.\"  One of his main projects was carried out in 1972.  In the framework of this project Kadishman painted a square in yellow organic paint on the land of the Monastery of the Cross, in the Valley of the Cross at the foot of the Israel Museum. The work became known as a \"monument of global nature, in which the landscape depicted by it is both the subject and the object of the creative process.\"<ref>Pierre Restany, Kadishman (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1996), p. 127. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nOther Israeli artists also created abstract sculptures charged with symbolism. The sculptures of [[Michael Gross (artist)|Michael Gross]] created an abstraction of the Israeli landscape, while those of [[Yaacov Agam]] contained a Jewish theological aspect. His work was also innovative in its attempt to create [[kinetic art]]. Works of his such as \"18 Degrees\" (1971) not only eroded the boundary between the work and the viewer of the work but also exhorted the viewer to look at the work actively.\n\nSymbolism of a different kind can be seen in the work of [[Dani Karavan]]. The outdoor sculptures that Karavan created, from \"[[Monument to the Negev Brigade]]\" (1963-1968) to \"White Square\" (1989) utilized avant-garde European art to create a symbolic abstraction of the Israeli landscape. In Karavan's use of the techniques of modernist, and primarily brutalist, architecture, as in his museum installations, Karavan created a sort of alternative environment to landscapes, redesigning it as a utopia, or as a call for a dialogue with these landscapes.<ref>See: Ruti Director, \u201cWhen Politics Becomes Kitsch,\u201d Studio, no. 92 (April 1998), pp. 28\u201333.</ref>\n\nMicha Ullman continued and developed the concept of nature and the structure of the excavations he carried out on systems of underground structures formulated according to a minimalist aesthetic.  These structures, like the work \"Third Watch\" (1980), which are presented as defense trenches made of dirt, are also presented as the place which housed the beginning of permanent human existence.<ref>See: Amnon Barzel, Israel: The 1980 Biennale (Jerusalem: Ministry of Education, 1980). [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\n[[Buky Schwartz]] absorbed concepts from conceptual art, primarily of the American variety, during the period that he lived in [[New York City]]. Schwartz's work dealt with the way the relationship between the viewer and the work of art is constructed and deconstructed. In the [[video art]] film \"Video Structures\" (1978-1980) Schwartz demonstrated the dismantling of the geometric illusion using optical methods, that is, marking an illusory form in space and then dismantling this illusion when the human body is interposed.<ref>See: Video Zero:  Written on the Body \u2013 A Live Transmission, the Screened Image \u2013 the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006), p. 48, pp. 70\u201371. [In Hebrew]</ref> In sculptures such as \"Levitation\" (1976) or \"Reflection Triangle\" (1980), Schwartz dismantled the serious geometry of his sculptures by inserting mirrors that produced the illusion that they were floating in the air, similarly to Kadishman's works in glass.\n\n===Representative sculpture of the 1970s===\n\n[[Performance art]] began to develop in the [[United States]] in the 1960s, trickling into Israeli art towards the end of that decade under the auspices of the \"[[Ten Plus]]\" group, led by [[Raffi Lavie]] and the \"[[Third Eye (performance artists)|Third Eye]]\" group, under the leadership of [[Jacques Cathmore]].<ref>See: Video Zero:  Written on the Body -- A Live Transmission, the Screened Image \u2013 the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006) pp. 35\u201336. [In Hebrew]</ref>  A large number of sculptors took advantage of the possibilities that the techniques of Performance Art opened for them with regard to a critical examination of the space around them.  In spite of the fact that many works renounced the need for genuine physical expression, nevertheless the examination they carry out shows the clear way in which the artists related to physical space from the point of view of social, political, and gender issues.\n\n[[Pinchas Cohen Gan]] during those years created a number of displays of a political nature.  In his work \"Touching the Border\" (January 7, 1974) iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border. The missiles were buried at the spot where the Israelis carrying them were arrested. In \"Performance in a Refugees Camp in Jericho\", which took place on February 10, 1974 in the northeast section of the city of Jericho near [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]] (Hisham's Palace), Cohen created a link between his personal experience as an immigrant and the experience of the Palestinian immigrant, by building a tent and a structure that looked like the sail of a boat, which was also made of fabric. At the same time, Cohen Gan set up a conversation about \"Israel 25 Years Hence\", in the year 2000, between two refugees, and accompanied by the declaration, \"A refugee is a person who cannot return to his homeland.\"<ref>See: Jonathan Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 142\u2013151.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nAnother artist, [[Efrat Natan]], created a number of performances dealing with the dissolution of the connection between the viewer and the work of art, at the same time criticizing Israeli militarism after the Six Day War. Among her important works was \"Head Sculpture,\" in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head. Natan wore the sculpture the day after the army's annual military parade in 1973, and walked with it to various central places in Tel Aviv. The form of the mask, in the shape of the letter \"T,\" bore a resemblance to a cross or an airplane and restricted her field of vision.\"<ref>See: Video Zero:  Written on the Body -- A Live Transmission, the Screened Image \u2013 the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006), p. 43. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nA blend of political and artistic criticism with poetics can be seen in a number of paintings and installations that Moshe Gershuni created in the 1970s. For Gershuni, who began to be famous during these years as a conceptual sculptor, art and the definition of esthetics was perceived as parallel and inseparable from politics in Israel. Thus, in his work \"A Gentle Hand\" (1975\u20131978), Gershuni juxtaposed a newspaper article describing abuse of a Palestinian with a famous love song by [[Zalman Shneur]] (called: \"All Her Heart She Gave Him\" and the first words of which are \"A gentle hand\", sung to an Arab melody from the days of the Second Aliyah (1904\u20131914). Gershuni sang like a muezzin into a loudspeaker placed on the roof of the Tel Aviv Museum. In works like these the minimalist and conceptualist ethics served as a tool for criticizing Zionism and Israeli society.<ref>See: Irit Segoli, \u201cMy Red is Your Dear Blood,\u201d Studio, No. 76 (October\u2013November 1996), pp. 38\u201339. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n[[File:Gideon Gechtman hasifa 005.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Exposure (Installation view), 1975 by [[Gideon Gechtman]]]]\nThe works of [[Gideon Gechtman]] during this period dealt with the complex relationship between art and the life of the artist, and with the dialectic between artistic representation and real life.<ref>See: Gideon Efrat, \u201cThe Heart of the Matter,\u201d Gideon Gechtman: Works 1971-1986, Autumn 1986, unnumbered. [In Hebrew]</ref> In the exhibition \"Exposure\" (1975), Gechtman described the ritual of shaving his body hair in preparation for heart surgery he had undergone, and used photographed documentation like doctors' letters and x-rays which showed the artificial heart valve implanted in his body. In other works, such as \"Brushes\" (1974\u20131975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary). These boxes were created according to strict minimalistic esthetic standards.\n\nAnother major work of Gechtman's during this period was exhibited in the exhibition entitled \"Open Workshop\" (1975) at the [[Israel Museum]]. The exhibition summarized the sociopolitical \"activity\" known as \"Jewish Work\" and, within this framework,\" Gechtman participated as a construction worker in the building of a new wing of the Museum and lived within the exhibition space.  on the construction site.  Gechtman also hung obituaries bearing the name \"Jewish Work\" and a photograph of the homes of Arab workers on the construction site.  In spite of the clearly political aspects of this work, its complex relationship to the image of the artist in society is also evident.\n\n==1980s and 1990s==\nIn the 1980s, influences from the international postmodern discourse began to trickle into Israeli art. Particularly important was the influence of philosophers such as Jacques Derrida and Jean Baudrillard, who formulated the concept of the semantic and relative nature of reality in their philosophical writings. The idea that the artistic representation is composed of \"simulacra\", objects in which the internal relation between the signifier and the signified is not direct, created a feeling that the status of the artistic object in general, and of sculpture in particular, was being undermined.\n\nGideon Gechtman's work expresses the transition from the conceptual approach of the 1970s to the 1980s, when new strategies were adopted that took real objects (death notices, a hospital, a child's wagon) and gradually converted them into objects of art.<ref>See: Neta Gal-Atzmon, \u201cCycles of Original and Imitation: Works 1973-2003,\u201d in Gideon Gechtman, Hedva, Gideon, and All the Rest (Tel Aviv: Association of Painters and Sculptors) (Unnumbered looseleaf folder).  [In Hebrew]</ref> The real objects were recreated in various artificial materials.  Death notices, for example, were made out of colored neon lights, like those used in advertisements.  Other materials Gechtman used in this period were formica and imitation marble, which in themselves emphasized the artificiality of the artistic representation and its non-biographical nature.\n\n[[File:Nahum Tevet, Painting Lesson, no 5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Nahum Tevet]]<br>Painting Lesson, no 5, 1986<br>Acrylic and industrial paint on wood; found object<br>[[Israel Museum]] collection]]\nDuring the 1980s, the works of a number of sculptors were known for their use of plywood. The use of this material served to emphasize the way large-scale objects were constructed, often within the tradition of do-it-yourself carpentry. The concept behind this kind of sculpture emphasized the non-heroic nature of a work of art, related to the \"Arte Povera\" style, which was at the height of its influence during these years. Among the most conspicuous of the artists who first used these methods is [[Nahum Tevet]], who began his career in the 1970s as a sculptor in the minimalist and conceptual style. While in the early 1970s he used a severe, nearly monastic, style in his works, from the beginning of the 1980s he began to construct works that were more and more complex, composed of disassembled parts, built in home-based workshops. The works are described as \"a trap configuration, which seduces the eye into penetrating the content [...] but is revealed as a false temptation that blocks the way rather than leading somewhere.\"<ref>Sarit Shapira, One Thing at a Time (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2007), p. 21. [In Hebrew]</ref> The group of sculptors who called themselves \"Drawing Lessons,\"  from the middle of the decade, and other works, such as \"Ursa Major (with eclipse)\" (1984) and \"Jemmain\" (1986)  created a variety of points of view, disorder, and spatial disorientation, which \"demonstrate the subject's loss of stability in the postmodernist world.\"<ref>See: Nahum Tevet in the \u201cCheck-Post\u201d exhibition (Website of the Haifa Museum of Art).</ref>\n\nThe sculptures of [[Drora Domini]] as well dealt with the construction and deconstruction of structures with a domestic connection.  Many of them featured disassembled images of furniture.  The abstract structures she built, on a relatively small scale, contained absurd connections between them.  Towards the end of the decade Domini began to combine additional images in her works from compositions in the \"ars poetica\" style.<ref>See: Drora Dumani in the \u201cCheck-Post\u201d exhibition (Website of the Haifa Museum of Art).</ref>\n\nAnother artist who created wooden structures  was the sculptor [[Isaac Golombek]]. His works from the end of the decade included familiar objects reconstructed from plywood and with their natural proportions distorted.  The items he produced had structures one on top of another. [[Itamar Levy]], in his article \"High Low Profile\" [Rosh katan godol],<ref>See: Itamar Levy, \u201cHigh Low Profile,\u201d Studio: Journal of Art, No. 111 (February 2000), pp. 38-45.  [In Hebrew]</ref> describes the relationship between the viewer and Golombek's works as an experiment in the separation of the sense of sight from the senses of touching and feeling. The bodies that Golombek describes are dismantled bodies, conducting a protest dialogue against the gaze of the viewer, who aspires to determine one unique, protected, and explainable identity for the work of art. While the form of the object represents a clear identity, the way they are made distances the usefulness of the objects and disrupts the feeling of materiality of the items.\n\nA different kind of construction can be seen in the performances of the [[Zik Group]], which came into being in the middle of the 1980s. Within the framework of its performances, the Group built large-scale wooden sculptures and created ritualistic activities around them, combining a variety of artistic techniques. When the performance ended, they set fire to the sculpture in a public burning ceremony. In the 1990s, in addition to destruction, the group also took began to focus on the transformation of materials and did away with the public burning ceremonies.<ref>The Zik Group: Twenty Years of Work, edited by Daphna Ben-Shaul (Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 2005).  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\n===Postmodern trends===\n[[File:S chen3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Sigal Primor]]<br>Untitled, 1989<br>Stainless steel]]\n[[File:Belu Simion Fainaru.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Belu-Simion Fainaru]]<br>Sham (There), 1996 <br>stone]]\n[[File:Sigalit Landau the country 13.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sigalit Landau]]<br>The Country (Installation view), 2002<br>Mixed Media ]]\n[[File:AND EUROPE WILL BE STUNNED.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Yael Bartana]]<br>...And Europe Will Be Stunned, 2012<br>Neon Light]]\nAnother effect of the postmodern approach was the protest against historical and cultural narratives. Art was not yet perceived as ideology, supporting or opposing the discourse on Israeli hegemony, but rather as the basis for a more open and pluralistic discussion of reality.  In the era following the \"political revolution\"  which resulted from the 1977 election, this was expressed in the establishment of the \"identity discussion,\" in which parts of society that up to now had not usually been represented in the main Israeli discourse were included.\n\nIn the beginning of the 1980s expressions of the trauma of the [[Holocaust]] began to appear in Israeli society. In the works of the \"second generation\" there began to appear figures taken from [[World War II]], combined with an attempt to establish a personal identity as an Israeli and as a Jew.  Among the pioneering works were [[Moshe Gershuni]]'s installation \"Red Sealing/Theatre\" (1980) and the works of [[Haim Maor]]. These expressions became more and more explicit in the 1990s. A large group of works was created by [[Igael Tumarkin]], who combined in his monumental creations dialectical images representing the horrors of the Holocaust with the world of European culture in which it occurred. The artist [[Penny Yassour]], for example, represented the Holocaust in a series of structures and models in which hints and quotes referring to the war appear. In the work \"Screens\" (1996), which was displayed at the \"Documenta\" exhibition, Yassour created a map of German trains in 1938 in the form of a table made out of rubber, as part of an experiment to present the memory and describe the relationship between private and public memory.<ref>] See: Galia Bar Or, \u201cParodoxical Space,\u201d Studio, No. 109 (November\u2013December 1999), pp. 45\u201353. [In Hebrew]</ref> The other materials Yassour used \u2013 metal and wood that created different architectonic spaces \u2013 produced an atmosphere of isolation and horror.\n\nAnother aspect of raising the memory of the Holocaust to the public consciousness was the focus on the immigrants who came to Israel during the first decades after the founding of the State.  These attempts were accompanied by a protest against the image of the Israeli \"[[Sabra (person)|Sabra]]\" and an emphasis on the feeling of detachment of the immigrants. The sculptor [[Philip Rentzer]] presented, in a number of works and installations, the image of the immigrant and the refugee in Israel.  His works, constructed from an assemblage of various ready-made materials, show the contrast between the permanence of the domestic and the feeling of impermanence of the immigrant. In his installation \"The Box from Nes Ziona\" (1998), Rentzer created an Orientalist camel carrying on its back the immigrants' shack of Rentzer's family, represented by skeletons carrying ladders.<ref>See: \u201cImmigrant With a Compulsion,\u201d Ynet  website: http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3476177,00.html   [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nIn addition to expressions of the Holocaust, a growing expression of the motifs of Jewish art can be seen in Israeli art of the 1990s. In spite of the fact that motifs of this kind could be seen in the past in art of such artists as [[Arie Aroch]], [[Moshe Castel]], and [[Mordechai Ardon]], the works of Israeli artists of the 1990s displayed a more direct relationship to the world of Jewish symbols. One of the most visible of the artists who used these motifs, [[Belu Simion Fainaru]] used Hebrew letters  and other symbols as the basis for the creation of objects with metaphysical-religious significance. In his work \"Sham\" (\"There\" in Hebrew) (1996), for example, Fainaru created a closed structure, with windows in the form of the Hebrew letter [[Shin (letter)|Shin]] (\u05e9). In another work, he made a model of a synagogue (1997), with windows in the shape of the letters, [[Aleph]] (\u05d0) to [[Zayin]] (\u05d6) - one to seven - representing the seven days of the creation of the world.<ref>David Schwarber, Ifcha Mistabra: The Culture of the Temple and Contemporary Israeli Art (Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University), pp. 46\u201347.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nDuring the 1990s we also begin to see various representations of [[Gender]] and sexual motifs.  [[Sigal Primor]] exhibited works that dealt with the image of women in Western culture.  In an environmental sculpture she placed on Sderot Chen in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Primor created a replica of furniture made of stainless steel. In this way, the structure points out the gap between personal, private space and public space. In many of Primor's works there is an ironic relationship to the motif of the \"bride\", as seen Marcel Duchamp's work, \"The Glass Door\". In her work \"The Bride\", materials such as cast iron, combined with images using other techniques such as photography, become objects of desire.\n\nIn her installation \"Dinner Dress (Tales About Dora)\" (1997), [[Tamar Raban]] turned a dining room table four meters in diameter into a huge crinoline and she organized an installation that took place both on top of and under the dining room table. The public was invited to participate in the meal prepared by chef Tsachi  Bukshester and watch what was going on under the table on monitors placed under the transparent glass dinner plates.<ref>For documentation on the installation, see: \u201cDinner Dress\u201d and the associated video on YouTube.</ref> The installation raises questions about the perceptions of memory and personal identity in a variety of ways.  During the performance, Raban would tell stories about \"Dora,\" Raban's mother 's name, with reference to the figure \"Dora\" \u2013 a nickname for [[Ida Bauer]], one of the historic patients of [[Sigmund Freud]]. In the corner of the room was the artist [[Pnina Reichman]], embroidering words and letters in English, such as \"all those lost words\" and \"contaminated memory,\" and counting in [[Yiddish]].<ref>See: Levia Stern, \u201cConversations About Dora,\u201d Studio: Journal of Art, No. 91 (March 1998), pp. 34\u201337. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nThe centrality of the gender discussion in the international cultural and art scene had an influence on Israeli artists. In the video art works of [[Hila Lulu Lin]], the protest against the traditional concepts of women's sexuality stood out. In her work \"No More Tears\" (1994), Lulu Lin appeared passing an egg yolk back and forth between her hand and her mouth. Other artists sought not only to express in their art homoeroticism and feelings of horror and death, but also to test the social legitimacy of homosexuality and lesbianism in Israel. Among these artists the creative team of [[Nir Nader]] and [[Erez Harodi]], and the performance artist [[Dan Zakheim]] stand out.\n\nAs the world of Israeli art was exposed to the art of the rest of the world, especially from the 1990s, a striving toward the \"total visual experience,\"<ref>Amitai Mendelson, \u201cThe Opening and Closing Spectacles: Rumblings About Art in Israel,1998-2007,\u201d Real-time (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2008).  [In Hebrew]</ref> expressed in large-scale installations and in the use of theatrical technologies, particularly of video art, can be seen in the works of many Israeli artists.  The subject of many of these installations is a critical test of space. Among these artists can be found [[Ohad Meromi]] and [[Michal Rovner]], who creates video installations in which human activities are converted into ornamental designs of texts. In the works of [[Uri Tzaig]] the use of video to test the activity of the viewer as a critical activity stands out. In \"Universal Square\" (2006), for example, Tzaig created a video art film in which two football teams compete on a field with two balls. The change in the regular rules created a variety of opportunities for the players to come up with new plays on the space of the football field.\n\nAnother well-known artist who creates large-scale installations is [[Sigalit Landau]]. Landau creates expressive environments with multiple sculptures laden with political and social allegorical significance. The apocalyptic exhibitions Landau mounted, such as \"The Country\" (2002) or \"Endless Solution\" (2005), succeeded in reaching large and varied segments of the population.\n\n==Commemorative sculpture==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 13833 Memorial Garden in Rehovot.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Monument for the Fallen in the War of Indeependence (1949) by [[Dov Feigin]] at [[Rehovot]]]]\n[[File:Negba Monument003 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Monument at Kibbuz Negba (1953) by [[Natan Rapoport]]]]\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 32072 Holocaust and Resurrection.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Monument to the Holocaust]] (1975) by [[Igael Tumarkin]]. [[Rabin Square]], Tel Aviv-Yaffo]]\n[[File:Yad Layeled2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Children's Memorial (1987) by [[Moshe Safdie]] at  [[Yad Vashem]], Jerusalem]]\nIn Israel there are many memorial sculptures whose purpose is to perpetuate the memory of various events in the history of the Jewish people and the State of Israel. Since the memorial sculptures are displayed in public spaces, they tend to serve as an expression of popular art of the period.  The first memorial sculpture erected in the Land of Israel was \u201c[[The Roaring Lion]]\u201d, which [[Abraham Melnikoff]] sculpted in [[Tel Hai]]. The large proportions of the statue and the public funding that Melnikoff recruited towards its construction, was an innovation for the small Israeli art scene. From a sculptural standpoint, the statue was connected to the beginnings of the \u201cCaananite\u201d movement in art.\n\nThe memorial sculptures erected in Israel up to the beginning of the 1950s, most of which were memorials for the fallen soldiers of the War of Independence, were characterized for the most part by their figurative subjects and elegiac overtones, which were aimed at the emotions of the Zionist Israeli public.<ref>See: Gideon Efrat, \u201cThe Dialectic of the 1950s: Hegemony and Multiciplicity,\u201d  in: Gideon Efrat and Galia Bar Or, The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity  (Kibbutz Ein Harod, Haim Atar Museum of Art, 2008), p. 18. [In Hebrew]</ref>  The structure of the memorials was designed as spatial theater.  The accepted model for the memorial included a wall with a wall covered in stone or marble, the back of which remained unused. On it, the names of the fallen soldiers were engraved. Alongside this was a relief of a wounded soldier or an allegorical description, such as descriptions of lions.  A number of memorial sculptures were erected as the central structure on a ceremonial surface meant to be viewed from all sides.<ref>See: Avner  Ben-Amos, \u201cThe Theater of Memory and Death: Memorials and Ceremonies in Israel,\u201d in Drora Dumani, Everywhere: Israeli Landscape with Memorial  (Tel Aviv: Hargol, 2002).  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nIn the design of these memorial sculptures we can see significant differences among the accepted patterns of memory of that period. [[Hashomer Hatzair]] (The Youth Guard) kibbutzim, for example, erected heroic memorial sculptures, such as the sculptures erected on Kibbutz [[Yad Mordechai]] (1951) or Kibbutz [[Negba]] (1953), which were expressionist attempts to emphasize the ideological and social connections between art and the presence of public expression.  Within the framework of [[HaKibbutz Ha\u2019Artzi]] intimate memorial sculptures were erected, such as the memorial sculpture \u201cMother and Child\u201d, which [[Chana Orloff]] erected at Kibbutz [[Ein Gev]] (1954) or [[Yechiel Shemi|Yechiel Shemi's]] sculpture on Kibbutz Hasolelim (1954).  These sculptures emphasized the private world of the individual and tended toward the abstract.<ref>See: Galia Bar Or, \u201cUniversal and International: The Art of the Kibbutz in the First Decade,\u201d in Gideon Efrat and Galia Bar Or, The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity  (Kibbutz Ein Harod, Haim Atar Museum of Art, 2008), p. 88. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nOne of the most famous memorial sculptors during the first decades after the founding of the State of Israel was [[Nathan Rapoport]], who immigrated to Israel in 1950, after he had already erected a memorial sculpture in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] to the fighters of the Ghetto (1946\u20131948).  Rapoport\u2019s many memorial sculptures, erected as memorials on government sites and on sites connected to the War of Independence, were representatives of sculptural expressionism, which took its inspiration from Neoclassicism as well. At Warsaw Ghetto Square at Yad Vashem (1971), Rapoport created a relief entitled \u201cThe Last March\u201d, which depicts a group of Jews holding a Torah scroll. To the left of this, Rapoport erected a copy of the sculpture he created for the Warsaw Ghetto. In this way, a \u201cZionist narrative\u201d of the Holocaust was created, emphasizing the heroism of the victims alongside the mourning.\n\nIn contrast to the figurative art which had characterized it earlier, from the 1950s on a growing tendency towards abstraction began to appear in memorial sculpture. At the center of the \u201cPilots\u2019 Memorial\" (1950s), erected by [[Benjamin Tammuz]] and [[Aba Elhanani]] in the Independence Park in Tel Aviv-Yaffo, stands an image of a bird flying above a Tel Aviv seaside cliff. The tendency toward the abstract can also be seen the work by [[David Palombo]], who created reliefs and memorial sculptures for government institutions like the Knesset and Yad Vashem, and in many other works, such as the memorial to [[Shlomo Ben-Yosef]] that [[Itzhak Danziger]] erected in [[Rosh Pina]]. However, the epitome of this trend toward avoidance of figurative images stands our starkly in the \u201cMonument to the Negev Brigade\u201d (1963\u20131968) which [[Dani Karavan]] created on the outskirts of the city of [[Beersheva]]. The monument was planned as a structure made of exposed concrete occasionally adorned with elements of metaphorical significance. The structure was an attempt to create a physical connection between itself and the desert landscape in which it stands, a connection conceptualized in the way the visitor wanders and views the landscape from within the structure. A mixture of symbolism and abstraction can be found in the \u201cMonument to the Holocaust and National Revival\u201d, erected in Tel Aviv\u2019s [[Rabin Square]] (then \u201cKings of Israel Square\u201d). [[Igael Tumarkin]], creator of the sculpture, used elements that created the symbolic form of an inverted pyramid made of metal, concrete, and glass. In spite of the fact that the glass is supposed to reflect what is happening in this urban space,<ref>Yigal Tumarkin, \"Monument to the Holocaust and Revival\", in Tumarkin (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1991 (unnumbered pages)</ref> the monument didn\u2019t express the desire for the creation of a new space which would carry on a dialogue with the landscape of the \u201cLand of Israel\u201d. The pyramid sits on a triangular base, painted yellow, reminiscent of the \u201cMark of Cain\u201d. The two structures together form a [[Magen David]].  Tumarkin saw in this form \u201ca prison cell that has been opened and breached. An overturned pyramid, which contains within itself, imprisoned in its base, the confined and the burdensome.\u201d<ref>] Yigal Tumarkin, \"Monument to the Holocaust and Revival\", in Tumarkin (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1991 (unnumbered pages)</ref> The form of the pyramid shows up in another work of the artists as well. In a late interview with him, Tumarkin confided that the pyramid can be perceived also as the gap between ideology and its enslaved results: \u201cWhat have we learned since the great pyramids were built 4200 years ago?[...]  Do works of forced labor and death liberate?\u201d<ref>Michal K. Marcus, In the Spacious Time of Yigal Tumarkin.</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s memorial sculptures began to be built in a theatrical style, abandoning the abstract. In the \u201cChildren\u2019s Memorial\u201d (1987), or the \u201cYad Vashem Train Car\u201d (1990) by [[Moshe Safdie]], or in the Memorial to the victims of \u201cThe Israeli Helicopter Disaster\u201d (2008), alongside the use of symbolic forms, we see the trend towards the use of various techniques to intensify the emotional experience of the viewer.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e8\u05d5\u05e7\u05d713.JPG|thumb|250px|Women sculptures of Lea Majaro-Mintz]]\nAttitudes toward the realistic depiction of the human body are complex. The birth of Israeli sculpture took place concurrently with the flowering of avantgarde and modernist European art, whose influence on sculpture from the 1930s to the present day is significant. In the 1940s the trend toward primitivism among local artists was dominant.  With the appearance of \u201cCanaanite\u201d art we see an expression of the opposite concept of the human body, as part of the image of the landscape of \u201cThe Land of Israel.\u201d That same desolate desert landscape became a central motif in many works of art until the 1980s.  With regard to materials, we see a small amount of use of stone and marble in traditional techniques of excavation and carving, and a preference for casting and welding. This phenomenon was dominant primarily in the 1950s, as a result of the popularity of the abstract sculpture of the \u201cNew Horizons\u201d group. In addition, this sculpture enabled artists to create art on a monumental scale, which was not common in Israeli art until then.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Visual arts in Israel]]\n*[[List of public art in Israel]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Israeli art]]\n[[Category:Israeli culture]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Trumpeldor.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Abraham Melnikov]]<br>The Roaring Lion, 1926\u20131934<br>Stone<br>[[Tel Hai]]]]\n'''Israeli sculpture''' designates [[sculpture]] produced in the [[Land of Israel]] from 1906, the year the \"[[Bezalel Academy of Art and Design|Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts]]\" (today called the Bezalel Academy of Art and Design) was established. The process of crystallization of Israeli sculpture was influenced at every stage by international sculpture. In the early period of Israeli sculpture, most of its important sculptors were immigrants to the Land of Israel, and their art was a [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]] of the influence of European sculpture with the way in which the national artistic identity developed in the Land of Israel and later in the State of [[Israel]].\n\nEfforts toward the development of a local style of sculpture began in the late 1930s, with the creation of \"[[Canaanism|Caananite]]\" sculpture, which combined influences from European sculpture with motifs taken from the East, and particularly from [[Mesopotamia]]. These motifs were formulated in national terms and strived to present the relationship between Zionism and the soil of the homeland. In spite of the aspirations of abstract sculpture, which blossomed in Israel in the middle of the 20th century under the influence of the \"New Horizons\" movement and attempted to present sculpture that spoke a universal language, their art included many elements of earlier \"Caananite\" sculpture. In the 1970s, many new elements found their way into Israeli art and sculpture, under the influence of international [[conceptual art]]. These techniques significantly changed the definition of sculpture. In addition, these techniques facilitated the expression of political and social protest, which up to this time had been downplayed in Israeli sculpture.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Bezalel Sculpture Class, 1914.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Bezalel sculpture class, 1914]]\nAn attempt to find indigenous 19th-century Israeli sources for the development of \"Israeli\" sculpture is problematic from two points of view.  First, both the artists and Jewish society in the Land of Israel were lacking the national Zionist motifs which would accompany the development of Israeli sculpture in the future.  This applies, of course, also to non-Jewish artists of the same period.  Second, art history research has failed to find a tradition of sculpture either among the Jewish communities of the Land of Israel or among the Arab or Christian residents of that period.  In research conducted by Yitzhak Einhorn, Haviva Peled, and Yona Fischer, artistic traditions of this period were identified, which include ornamental art of a religious (Jewish and Christian) nature, which was created for pilgrims and, therefore, for both export and local needs.  These objects included decorated tablets, embossed soaps, seals, etc. with motifs borrowed for the most part from the tradition of graphic art.<ref>See, Yona Fischer  (Ed.),  Art and Art in the Land of Israel in the Nineteenth Century (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1979).  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nIn his article \"Sources of Israeli Sculpture\"<ref>Gideon Ofrat, Sources of the Land of Israel Sculpture, 1906-1939 (Herzliya: Herzliya Museum, 1990).  [In Hebrew]</ref> [[Gideon Ofrat]] identified the beginning of Israeli sculpture as the founding of the Bezalel School in 1906. At the same time, he identified a problem in trying to present a unified picture of that sculpture. The reasons were the variety of European influences on Israeli sculpture, and the relatively small number of sculptors in Israel, most of whom had worked for long periods in Europe.\n\nAt the same time, even at the Bezalel \u2013 a school of art founded by a sculptor \u2013 sculpture was considered a lesser art, and the studies there concentrated on the art of painting and the crafts of graphic and design.  Even in the \"New Bezalel\", founded in 1935, Sculpture did not occupy a significant place. While it is true that a department of sculpture was set up in the new school, it closed a year later, because it was viewed as a tool to help students learn three-dimensional design and not as an independent department. In its place a department of pottery<ref>See, Gideon Efrat, The New Bezalel, 1935-1955 (Jerusalem: Bezalel Academy of Art and Design, 1987)  pp. 128-130.  [In Hebrew]</ref> opened and flourished. There were exhibitions by individual sculptors during these years both in the Bezalel Museum and in the Tel Aviv Museum, but these were exceptions and were not indicative of the general attitude toward three-dimensional art. An ambiguous attitude toward sculpture by the artistic establishment could be felt, in various incarnations, well into the 1960s.\n\n===Early sculpture in the Land of Israel===\n\n[[File:Shatz herzel.jpg|250px|right|thumb|[[Boris Schatz]] sculpts the figure of [[Theodor Herzl]]]]\n[[File:Bikur Cholim Hospital doors 004-2.jpg|250px|right|thumb|\"[[Tribe of Issachar]]\" by [[Ze'ev Raban]], detail from a brass door at [[Bikur Cholim Hospital]], [[Jerusalem]]]]\n[[File:Judah Arising2.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Awakening Judah (1925) by [[Abraham Melnikoff]]. [[Ramat Gan National Park]], [[Ramat Gan]]]]\nThe beginning of sculpture in the Land of Israel, and of Israeli art in general, is usually designated as 1906, the year of the founding of the Bezalel School of Arts and Crafts in Jerusalem by [[Boris Schatz]]. Schatz, who studied sculpture in Paris with [[Mark Antokolski]], was already a well-known sculptor when he arrived in Jerusalem.  He specialized in relief portraiture of Jewish subjects in an academic style.\n\nSchatz's work attempted to establish a new Jewish-Zionist identity He expressed this by using figures from the Bible within a framework derived from European Christian culture. His work \"Matthew the Hasmoneum\" (1894), for example, depicted the Jewish national hero [[Mattathias|Mattathias ben Johanan]] grasping a sword and with his foot on the body of a Greek soldier. This kind of representation is connected to the ideological theme of \"The Victory of Good Over Evil\", as expressed, for example, in the figure of Perseus in a sculpture from the 15th century.<ref>See, Alec Mishory, Behold, Gaze, and See (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2000) pp. 53\u201355. [In Hebrew]</ref> Even a series of memorial plaques Schatz created for the leaders of the Jewish settlement is derived from Classical art, combined with the descriptive tradition in the spirit of the Ars Novo tradition. The influence of Classical and [[Renaissance art]] on Schatz can be seen even in the copies of sculptures he ordered for Bezalel, which he displayed in the Bezalel Museum as examples of ideal sculpture for the students in the school. These sculptures include \"[[David (Verrocchio)|David]]\" (1473\u20131475) and \"Putto with a Dolphin\" (1470) by [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].<ref>] See, Alec Mishory, Behold, Gaze, and See (Tel Aviv: Am Oved, 2000) p. 51. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nThe studies at Bezalel tended to favor painting, drawing, and design, and as a result the amount of three-dimensional sculpture turned out there was limited. Among the few workshops which opened at the school was one in [[woodcarving]], in which reliefs of various Zionist and Jewish leaders were produced, along with workshops in decorative design in applied art using techniques such as hammering copper into thin sheets, setting gems, etc. In 1912 a department for [[ivory]] design, which also emphasized the applied arts, was opened.<ref>Nurit Shilo-Cohen, Schatz\u2019s Bezalel  (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1983) pp. 55\u201368.  [In Hebrew]</ref> In the course of its activities workshops were added that functioned nearly autonomously. In a memo issued in June 1924, Schatz outlined all of the major fields of activity of Bezalel, among them stone sculpture, which was founded primarily by students of the school within the framework of the \"Jewish Legion\" and the workshop on woodcarving.<ref>] Nurit Shilo-Cohen, Schatz\u2019s Bezalel  (Jerusalem, The Israel Museum, 1983) p.98.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nBesides Schatz, there were several other artists in Jerusalem in the early days of Bezalel who were working in the field of sculpture. In 1912 [[Ze'ev Raban]] immigrated to the Land of Israel at Schatz's invitation and served as an instructor in sculpture, sheet copper work, and anatomy at Bezalel. Raban had trained in sculpture at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, and later at the [[Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]] and the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Royal Academy of Fine Arts]] in [[Antwerp]], Belgium. In addition to his well-known graphic work, Raban created figurative sculptures and reliefs in the academic \"Oriental\" style, such as the terracotta figurine of the Biblical figures \"Eli and Samuel\" (1914), who are depicted as Yemenite Jews.  However Raban's most important work focused on embossments for jewelry and other decorative items.<ref>About the jewelry design of Raban, see Yael Gilat, \u201cThe Ben Shemen Jewelers\u2019 Community, Pioneer in the Work-at-Home Industry: From the Resurrection of the Spirit of the Botega to the Resurrection of the Guilds,\u201d in Art and Crafts, Linkages, and Borders, edited by Nurit Canaan Kedar, (Tel Aviv: The Yolanda and David Katz Art Faculty, Tel Aviv University, 2003), 127\u2013144. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nOther instructors at Bezalel also created sculptures in the realistic academic style. [[Eliezer Strich]], for instance, created busts of people in the Jewish settlement. Another artist, [[Yitzhak Sirkin]] carved portraits in wood and in stone.\n\nThe main contribution to Israel sculpture of this period can be contributed to Abraham Melnikoff, who worked outside the framework of Bezalel. Melnikoff created his first work in Israel in 1919, after he arrived in the Land of Israel during his service in the \"[[Jewish Legion]]\". Until the 1930s, Melnikoff produced a series of sculptures in various kinds of stone, mostly portraiture done in [[terracotta]] and stylized images carved out of stone. Among his significant works is a group of symbolic sculptures depicting the awakening of the Jewish identity, such as \"The Awakening Judah\" (1925), or memorial monuments to [[Ahad Ha'am]] (1928) and to [[Max Nordau]] (1928). In addition, Melnikoff presided over presentations of his works in exhibits of Artists of the Land of Israel in the [[Tower of David]].\n\nThe \"Roaring Lion\" monument (1928\u20131932) is a continuation of this trend, but this sculpture is different in the way it was perceived by the Jewish public of that period.  Melnikoff himself initiated the building of the monument, and funding for the project was attained jointly by the Histadrut ha-Clalit, the Jewish National Council, and [[Alfred Mond]] (Lord Melchett). The image of the monumental [[lion]], sculpted in granite, was influenced by primitive art combined with Mesopotamian art of the 7th and 8th centuries A.D.<ref>Haim Gamzo compared the sculpture to the image of the Assyrian lion from Khorsabad, found in the collection of the Louvre.  See Haim Gamzo, The Art of Sculpture in Israel (Tel Aviv: Mikhlol Publishing House Ltd., 1946) (without page numbers). [In Hebrew]</ref> The style is expressed primarily in the anatomical design of the figure.\n\n[[File:Zaid1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Alexander Za\u00efd monument by [[David Polus]]]]\n[[File:Zeev ben-zvi-meskin.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Aharon Meskin]] by [[Zeev Ben-Zvi]]]]\nThe sculptors who started to produce works at the end of the 1920s and the beginning of the 1930s in the Land of Israel demonstrated a wide variety of influences and styles. Among them were a few who went by the teachings of the Bezalel School, while others, who arrived after studying in Europe, brought with them the influence of early French Modernism on art, or the influence of Expressionism, especially in its German form.\n\nAmong the sculptors who were Bezalel students, the works of [[Aaron Priver]] stand out. Priver arrived in the Land of Israel in 1926 and began to study sculpture with Melnikoff. His work displayed a combination of a tendency toward realism and an archaic or moderately primitive style. His feminine figures of the 1930s are designed with rounded lines and sketchy facial features. Another pupil, [[Nachum Gutman]], better known for his paintings and drawings, traveled to [[Vienna]] in 1920, and later went to [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]], where he studied sculpture and printmaking and produced sculptures on a small scale which show traces of expressionism and a tendency toward a \"primitive\" style in the depiction of its subjects.\n\nThe works of [[David Ozeransky]] (Agam) continued the decorative tradition of [[Ze'ev Raban]].  Ozeransky even worked as a laborer on the sculptural decorations Raban created for the YMCA building in Jerusalem. Ozeransky's most important work of this period is \"Ten Tribes\" (1932) \u2013 a group of ten square decorative tablets, which describe in symbolic terms the ten cultures associated with the history of the Land of Israel. Another work that Ozeranzky was involved in creating during this period was \"The Lion\" (1935) that stands atop the Generali Building in Jerusalem.<ref>see: Yael Gilat, Artists Write the Myth Again: Alexander Zaid\u2019s Memorial and the Works That Followed in its Footsteps, Oranim Academic College Website [In Hebrew]    <http://info.oranim.ac.il/home/home.exe/16737/23928?load=T.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928000305/http://info.oranim.ac.il/home/home.exe/16737/23928?load=T.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}></ref>\n\nAlthough he was never a student at the institution, the work of [[David Polus]] was anchored in the Jewish academism which Schatz formulated at Bezalel. Polus began to sculpt after he was a stonemason in the labor corps. His first significant work was a statue of \"David the Shepherd\" (1936\u20131938) in [[Ramat David]]. In his monumental work 1940 \"[[Alexander Zeid|Alexander Zeid Memorial]]\", which was cast in concrete at \"Sheik Abreik\" and stands near the [[Beit She'arim]] National Park, Polus represents the man known as \"The Watchman\"  as a horseman looking out over the view of the Jezreel Valley. In 1940 Polus placed at the base of the monument two tablets, in archaic-symbolic style, whose subjects were \"the thicket\" and \"the shepherd.\"<ref>Yael Gilat, Artists Write the Myth Again: Alexander Zaid\u2019s Memorial and the Works That Followed in its Footsteps, Oranim Academic College Website [In Hebrew]</ref>  While the style of the main statue  is realistic, it became known for its attempt to glorify its subject and emphasize his connection with the land.\n\nIn 1910 the sculptress [[Chana Orloff]] emigrated from the Land of Israel to France and began studies in the [[\u00c9cole Nationale des Arts D\u00e9coratifs]]. Her work, beginning with the period of her studies, emphasizes her connection to French art of the time. Particularly evident is the influence of Cubist sculpture, which moderated in her work with the passage of time. Her sculptures, mostly human images carved in stone and wood, designed as geometric spaces and flowing lines. A significant portion of her work is devoted to sculptural portraits of figures from French society.<ref>See Haim Gamzo, Chana Orloff (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1968). [In Hebrew]</ref> Her connection with the Land of Israel, Orloff preserved through an exhibition of her works in the Tel Aviv Museum.<ref>] Her museum exhibitions during those years took place in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in 1935, and in the Tel Aviv Museum of Art and the Haifa Museum of Art in 1949.</ref>\n\nAnother sculptor who was greatly influenced by Cubism is Zeev Ben Zvi.  In 1928, after his studies in Bezalel, Ben Zvi went to study in Paris.  Upon his return, he served for short periods as an instructor in sculpture at Bezalel and at the \"New Bezalel.\"  In 1932 his first exhibition was held at the Bezalel national antiquities museum, and a year later he mounted an exhibition of his works at the Tel Aviv Museum.  His sculpture \"The Pioneer\" was displayed at the Orient Fair in Tel Aviv in 1934.  In Ben Zvi's work, as in Orloff's, the language of the Cubists, the language in which he designed his sculptures, did not abandon realism and stayed within the boundaries of traditional sculpture.<ref>Haim Gamzo, The Sculptor Ben-Zvi (Tel Aviv: HaZvi Publications, 1955). [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nThe influence of French realism can also be seen in the group of Israeli artists who were influenced by the realistic trend of early twentieth-century French sculptors like [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Aristide Maillol]], etc. The symbolic baggage of both their content and their style showed up as well in the work of Israeli artists, such as [[Moses Sternschuss]], [[Raphael Chamizer]], [[Moshe Ziffer]], [[Joseph Constant]] (Constantinovsky), and [[Dov Feigin]], most of whom studied sculpture in France.\n\nOne of this group of artists \u2013 Batya Lishanski \u2013 studied painting in Bezalel, and took courses in sculpture in the Parisian [[\u00c9cole nationale sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts]]. When she returned to Israel, she created figurative and expressive sculpture, which showed the clear influence of Rodin, who emphasized the corporeality of his sculptures. The series of monuments that Lishanski created, the first of which was \"Labor and Defense\" (1929),  which was built over the grave of [[Ephraim Chisik]] - who died in the battle for the Hulda Farm (today, Kibbutz [[Hulda, Israel|Hulda]]) - as a reflection of the Zionist utopia during that period: a combination of the redemption of the land and the defense of the homeland.\n\nThe influence of German art and particularly of German expressionism can be seen in the group of artists who arrived in the Land of Israel after receiving their training in art in various German cities and in Vienna.  Artists such as [[Jacob Brandenburg]], [[Trude Chaim]], and [[Lili Gompretz-Beatus]], and George Leshnitzer produced figurative sculpture, primarily portraiture, designed in a style that wavered between impressionism and moderate  expressionism.  Among the artists of that group [[Rudi Lehmann|Rudolf (Rudi) Lehmann]], who started teaching art in a studio he opened in the 1930s, stands out.  Lehmann had studied sculpture and wood carving with a German named L. Feurdermeier, who specialized in animal sculptures. The figures that Lehmann created  showed the influence of expressionism  in the gross design of the body, which emphasized the material from which the sculpture was made and the way the sculptor worked on it. In spite of the overall appreciation of his work, Lehmann's primary importance was as a teacher of the methods of classical sculpture, in stone and wood, to a large number of Israeli artists.\n\n===Caananite to abstract, 1939\u20131967===\n\n[[File:Danziger, Itzhak, Nimrod, 1939.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Nimrod (1939) by [[Itzhak Danziger]]]]\n[[File:The Firs Ones.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The First Ones (1958) by [[Shoshanna Heimann]]]]\n[[File:Amos kenan.JPG|thumb|right|250px|\"Messiah\" (1966) by [[Amos Kenan]]. Tefen Sculpture Garden]]\nAt the end of the 1930s, a group called \"[[Canaanism|The Caananites]]\" \u2013 a broad sculptural movement, primarily literary in nature \u2013 was founded in Israel. This group tried to create a direct line between the early peoples living in the Land of Israel, in the second millennium before the Christian Era, and the Jewish people in the Land of Israel in the 20th century, at the same time striving toward the creation of a new-old culture which would separate itself from Jewish tradition. The artist most closely associated with this movement was the sculptor [[Itzhak Danziger]], who returned to the Land of Israel in 1938 after studying art in [[England]]. The new nationalism that Danziger's \"Caananite\" art suggested, a nationalism that was anti-European and full of Eastern sensuality and exoticism, reflected the attitude of many of the people living in the Jewish community in the Land of Israel. \"The dream of Danziger's generation\", [[Amos Keinan]] wrote after Danziger's death, was \"to merge with the Land of Israel and with the land, to create a specific image with recognizable signs, something that is from here and is us, and imprint the stamp of that something special that is us on history.<ref>Amos Kenan, \u201cGreater Israel,\u201d Yedioth Ahronoth, 19 August 1977. [In Hebrew]</ref> Aside from nationalism, the artists created sculpture which expressed a symbolic expressionism in the spirit of British sculpture of the same period.\n\nIn Tel Aviv Danziger  founded a sculpture studio in the courtyard of his father's hospital, and there he critiqued and taught young sculptors such as [[Benjamin Tammuz]], [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Yehiel Shemi]], [[Mordechai Gumpel]], and others.<ref>] The Story of Israeli Art, Benjamin Tammuz, Editor (Jerusalem: Masada Publishing House, 1980), p. 134. [In Hebrew]</ref>  In addition to Danziger's pupils, the studio became a gathering place for artists in other fields.  In this studio Danziger created his first significant works \u2013 \"Nimrod\" (1939) and \"Shebaziya\" (1939).\n\nFrom the moment it was first displayed, the statue \"Nimrod\" became the center of a dispute in the culture of Eretz Israel; in this sculpture Danziger presented the figure of [[Nimrod]], the biblical hunter, as a lean youth, naked and uncircumcised, with a sword pressed close to his body, and a falcon on his shoulder. The form of the statue was reminiscent of the primitive art of the Assyrian, Egyptian, and Greek cultures, and similar in spirit to European sculpture of this period. In its form the statue displayed a unique combination of [[homoerotic]] beauty and pagan idol worship. This combination was at the center of the criticism of the religious community in the Jewish settlement. At the same time other voices declared it the model for the 'new Jewish man'. In 1942 an article appeared in the newspaper \"HaBoker\" declaring that \"Nimrod is not just a sculpture, it is the flesh of our flesh, the spirit of our spirit. It is a milestone and a monument. It is the epitome of ingenuity and daring, of monumentality, of the youthful rebellion that characterizes an entire generation...Nimrod will be forever young.\"<ref>Cited in: Sara Breitberg Semel, \u201cAgripas vs. Nimrod,\u201d Kav, No. 9 (1999). [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nThe first showing of the sculpture in the \"General Exhibition of the Young People of Eretz Israel\", in [[Habima Theatre]] in May, 1942<ref>] This exhibition is dated according to Gamzo\u2019s critique, which was published on May 2, 1944.</ref> engendered the persistent argument over the \"Caananite\"  movement. Because of the exhibition, [[Yonatan Ratosh]], founder of the movement, got in touch with him and requested a meeting with him.  The criticism against \"Nimrod\" and the Caananites was coming not just from religious elements who, as mentioned above, protested against this representative of the pagan and the idolatrous, but also from secular critics who condemned the removal of everything \"Jewish\". To a large extent, \"Nimrod\" ended up in the middle of a dispute that had been started long before.\n\nIn spite of the fact that Danziger later expressed doubts about \"Nimrod\" as a model for Israeli culture, many other artists adopted the Caananite approach to sculpture. Images of idols and figures in the \"primitive\" style showed up in Israeli art until the 1970s. In addition, the influence of this group can be seen to a significant degree in the work of the \"New Horizons\" group, most of whose members experimented with the Caananite style early in their artistic careers.\n\n===\"New Horizons\" group===\n{{main|New Horizons (art movement)}}\n[[File:Feigin ein harod.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Growth (1959) by [[Dov Feigin]]. Museum of Art, Ein Harod]]\n[[File:The Burning Bush (1959) by Ithak Danziger.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Burning Bush (1959) by [[Yitzhak Danziger]]]]\n[[File:Achziv Pesel-Yam21.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Pesel Yam (1964\u20137) by [[Yehiel Shemi]], Achziv beach]]\n\nIn 1948, a movement called \"[[New Horizons (art movement)|New Horizons]]\" (\"Ofakim Hadashim\") was founded. It identified with the values of European modernism, and particularly with abstract art. [[Kosso Eloul]], [[Moshe Sternschuss]], and [[Dov Feigin]] were appointed to the group of founders of the movement, and were later joined by other sculptors. The Israeli sculptors were perceived as a minority not only because of the small number of them in the movement, but primarily because of the dominance of the medium of painting in the view of the leaders of the movement, especially [[Joseph Zaritsky]]. In spite of the fact that most of the sculptures of members of the group were not \"pure\" abstract sculpture, they included elements of abstract art and metaphysical symbolism.  Non-abstract art was perceived as old-fashioned and irrelevant. Sternschuss, for example, described the pressure that was put upon members of the group not to include figurative  elements in their art. It was a long struggle that began in 1959, the year that was considered by members of the group as the year of \"the victory of abstraction\"<ref>Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 10.  [In Hebrew]</ref> and reached its peak in the mid-1960s. Sternschuss even told a story about an incident in which one of the artists wanted to display a sculpture that was considerably more avante-garde than what was generally accepted.  But it had a head, and because of this, one of the members of the board testified against him on this issue.<ref>On the subject of kibbutz pressure, see Gila Blass, New Horizons (Tel Aviv: Papyrus and Reshefim Publishers, 1980), pp. 59\u201360. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nGideon Ophrat, in his essay on the group, found a strong connection between the painting and sculpture of \"New Horizons\" and the art of the \"Caananites.\"<ref>See Gideon Ophrat, \u201cThe Secret Canaanism in \u2018New Horizons\u2019,\u201d Art Visits [Bikurei omanut], 2005.</ref> In spite of the \"international\" hue of the artistic forms that the members of the group exhibited, many of their works showed a mythological depiction of the Israeli landscape. In December 1962, for example, Kosso Eloul organized an international symposium on sculpture in [[Mitzpe Ramon]]. This event  served as an example of the growing interest of the sculptures in the Israeli landscape, and in particular in the desolate desert landscape. The landscape was perceived, on the one hand, as the basis for the thought processes for creating many monuments and memorial sculptures. [[Yona Fisher]] speculated, in his research on art in the 1960s, that the interest of sculptors in the \"magic of the desert\" arose not just from a romantic yearning for nature, but also from an attempt to inculcate in Israel an environment of \"Culture\" rather than \"Civilization\".<ref>] Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now  (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), pp. 30\u201331.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nThe test with regard to the works of each member of the group lay in the different way he dealt with abstraction and with landscape.  The crystallization of the abstract nature of Dov Feigin's sculpture, was part of a process of an artistic search that was influenced by international sculpture, particularly that of [[Julio Gonz\u00e1lez (sculptor)|Julio Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Constantin Br\u00e2ncu\u0219i]], and [[Alexander Calder]]. The most important artistic change took place in 1956, when Feigin changed over to metal (iron) sculpture.<ref>See: L. Orgad, Dov Feigin (Tel Aviv: The Kibbutz  HaMeuhad [The United Kibbutz], 1988), pp. 17\u201319. [In Hebrew]</ref> His works from this year onward, such as \"Bird\" and \"Flight\" were constructed by welding together strips of iron which were placed in compositions full of dynamism and movement. The transition from linear sculpture to planar sculpture, using cut and bent copper or iron, was a process of natural development for Feigin, who was influenced by the works of [[Pablo]] Picasso done using a similar technique.\n\nIn contrast to Feigin, Moshe Sternschuss shows a more gradual development in his move toward abstraction. After finishing his studies at Bezalel, Sternschuss went to study in Paris.  In 1934 he returned to Tel Aviv and was among the founders of the Avni Institute ofArt and Design.  Sternschuss' sculptures during that period displayed an academic modernism, although they were lacking the Zionist features present in art of the Bezalel School. Beginning in the middle of the 1940s, his human figures displayed a marked tendency toward abstraction, as well as a growing use of geometric forms. One of the first of these sculptures was \"Dance\" (1944),  which was displayed in an exhibition next to \"Nimrod\" in this year. Actually, Sternschuss' work never became completely abstract, but continued to deal with the human figure by non-figurative means.<ref>See: Irit Hadar, Moses Sternschuss  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 2001).  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nWhen Itzhak Danziger returned to Israel in 1955, he joined \"New Horizons\" and began making metal sculptures. The style of the sculptures he developed was influenced by constructivist art, which was expressed in its abstract forms. Nonetheless, much of the subject matter of his sculptures was clearly local, as in sculptures with names associated with the Bible, such as \"Horns of Hattin\" (1956), the place of Saladin's victory over the crusaders in 1187, and The Burning Bush (1957), or with places in Israel, such as \"Ein Gedi\" (1950s), \"Sheep of the Negev\" (1963), etc. To a considerable extent this combination characterized the works of many of the artists of the movement.<ref>] A similar analysis of the narrative of Israeli sculpture appears in Gideon Ophrat\u2019s article, \u201cThe Secret Canaanism\u201d in \u2018New Horizons\u2019,\u201d Studio, No. 2 (August, 1989). [In Hebrew]  The article appears also in his book, With Their Backs to the Sea: Images of Place in Israeli Art and Literature, Israeli Art (Israeli Art Publishing House, 1990), pp. 322\u2013330.</ref>\n\n[[Yechiel Shemi]], also one of Danziger's pupils, moved to metal sculpture in 1955 for a practical reason. This move facilitated the move to abstraction in his work. His works, which made use of the technique of soldering, welding, and hammering into thin strips, was one of the first sculptors from this group that worked with these techniques.26  In works such as \"Mythos\"  (1956) Shemi's connection with the \"Caananite\" art from which he developed can still be seen, but soon after he eliminated all identifiable signs of figurative art from his work.\n\nIsraeli-born [[Ruth Tzarfati]] studied sculpture in Avni's studio with Moses Sternschuss, who became her husband. In spite of the stylistic and social closeness between Zarfati and the \"New Horizons\" artists, her sculpture shows overtones that are independent from the rest of the members of the group.  This is expressed primarily in her display of figurative sculpture with curved lines. Her sculpture \"She Sits\" (1953), depicts an unidentified female figure, using lines characteristics of European expressive sculpture, such as the sculpture of Henry Moore. Another group of sculpture, \"Baby Girl\" (1959) shows a group of children and babies designed as dolls in grotesque expressive poses.\n\n[[David Palombo]]\u00a0(1920 \u2013 1966) realised a number of powerful, abstract iron sculptures before his early death.<ref name=\"Palombo\">[https://www.knesset.gov.il/lexicon/eng/plimbo_eng.htm David Palombo], on the [[Knesset]] website, accessed 16 October 2019</ref> Palombo's sculptures from the 1960s can be considered to express Holocaust memories through \"the sculptural aesthetics of fire\".<ref>{{cite web |author= Gideon Ofrat |title= Aharon Bezalel |work= Aharon Bezalel sculptures |url= http://www.aharonbezalel.com/gideon-ofrat.html |quote= Indeed, the sculptural aesthetics of fire, bearing memories of the Holocaust (at that time finding their principal expression in the sculptures of Palombo).... |access-date= 16 October 2019 </ref>\n\n===Sculpture of protest===\n[[File:He Walked through the Fields.jpg|thumb|right|250px|He Walked through the Fields (1967) by Yigal Tumarkin]]\nIn the early 1960s, American influences, particularly abstract expressionism, pop art, and somewhat later, conceptual art, began to appear in Israeli art. In addition to new artistic forms, [[pop art]] and conceptual art brought with them a direct connection to the political and social realities of the time. In contrast, the central trend in Israeli art was towards a preoccupation with the personal and the artistic, ignoring to a large extent a discussion of the Israeli political landscape. Artists who concerned themselves with social or Jewish issues were looked on by the artistic establishment as anarchists.<ref>See: Yona Fischer and Tamar Manor-Friedman, The Birth of Now (Ashdod: Ashdod Museum of Art, 2008), p. 76.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nOne of the first artists whose works expressed not only international artistic influences, but also the tendency to deal with current political issues, was [[Yigal Tumarkin]], who returned to Israel in 1961, at  the encouragement of Yona Fischer and Sam Dubiner, from East Berlin, where he had been the set manager of the Berliner Ensemble theater company, under the direction of Berthold Brecht.<ref>Igael Tumarkin, \u201cDanziger in the Eyes of Igael Tumarkin,\u201d Studio, No. 76 (October\u2013November 1996), pp. 21\u201323. [In Hebrew]</ref> His early sculptures were created as expressive assemblages, put together from parts of various kinds of weapons.  His sculpture \"Take Me Under Your Wings\"(1964\u201365), for example, Tumarkin created a sort of steel casing with rifle barrels sticking out of it. The mixture that we see in this sculpture of the nationalistic dimension and the lyric, and even erotic, dimension, was to become a striking element in Tumarkin's political art in the 1970s.<ref>Ginton, Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), p. 28.  [In Hebrew]</ref> A similar approach can be seen in his famous sculpture \"He Walked in the Fields\" (1967) (the same name as [[Moshe Shamir]]'s famous story), which protested against the image of the \"mythological Sabra\"; Tumarkin strips off his \"skin\" and exposes his torn innards from which weapons and ammunition protrude and his stomach, which contains a round bomb that looks suspiciously like a uterus. During the 1970s Tumarkin's art evolved to include new materials influenced by \"[[Land art]],\" such as dirt, tree branches, and pieces of cloth.  In this way, Tumarkin sought to sharpen the focus of his political protest against what he saw as the one-sided approach of Israeli society toward the Arab-Israeli conflict.\n\nAfter the Six-Day War Israeli art began to demonstrate other expressions of protest than those of Tumarkin.  At the same time, these works did not look like conventional works of sculpture, made of wood or metal.  The main reason for this was the influence of various kinds of avant-garde art, which developed for the most part in the United States and influenced young Israeli artists.  The spirit of this influence could be seen in a tendency toward active artistic works that blurred both the boundaries between the different fields of art and the separation of the artist from social and political life.  The sculpture of this period was no longer perceived as an independent artistic object, but rather as an inherent expression of physical and social space.\n\n===Landscape sculpture in conceptual art===\n\nAnother aspect of these trends was the growing interest in the boundless Israeli landscape. These works were influenced by [[Land Art]] and a combination of the dialectical relationship between the \"Israeli\" landscape and the \"Eastern\" landscape. In many works with ritualistic and metaphysical traits, the development or direct influence of the Canaanite artists or sculptors can be seen, along with the abstraction of \"New Horizons\", in the various relationships with the landscape.\n\nOne of the first projects in Israel under the banner of conceptual art was carried out by [[Joshua Neustein]]. In 1970 Neustein, collaborated with [[Georgette Batlle]] and [[Gerry Marx]] on \"Jerusalem River Project\".  For this project speakers installed across a desert valley played looped sounds of a river in East Jerusalem, in the foothills of [[Abu Tor]] and Saint Claire's Convent, and all the way to the [[Kidron Valley]]. This imaginary river not only created an extraterritorial museum atmosphere, but also hinted in an ironic way at the feeling of messianic redemption after the Six Day War, in the spirit of the [[Book of Ezekiel]] (Chapter 47) and the [[Book of Zechariah]] (Chapter  14).<ref>Ginton, Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 32\u201336.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\n[[Yitzhak Danziger]], whose works had begun portraying the local landscape several years earlier, expressed the conceptual aspect in a style he developed as a distinctive Israeli variation of Land Art. Danziger felt that there was a need for reconciliation and improvement in the damaged relationship between man and his environment. This belief led him to plan projects which combined the rehabilitation of sites with ecology and culture. In 1971, Danziger presented his project \"Hanging Nature\", in a collaborative project in The [[Israel Museum]]. The work was composed of hanging fabric on which was a mixture of colors, plastic emulsion, cellulose fibers, and chemical fertilizer, on which Danziger was growing grass using a system of artificial light and irrigation. Next to the fabric, slides showing the destruction of nature by modern industrialization were screened. The exhibition requested the creation of an ecology unity, which would exist as \"art\" and as \"nature\" simultaneously.<ref>Yona Fischer , in: Itzhak Danziger,  Place (Tel Aviv: Ha Kibbutz HaMeuhad Publishing House, 1982. (The article is untitled and preceded by the following quotation: \u201cArt precedes science.\u201d  The pages in the book are unnumbered).  [In Hebrew]</ref> The \"repair\" of the landscape as an artistic event was developed by Danziger in his project \"The Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry\", on the northern slopes of [[Mount Carmel]]. This project was created as a collaboration between Danziger, [[Zeev Naveh]] the ecologist, and [[Joseph Morin (researcher)|Joseph Morin]] the soil researcher.  In this project, which was never finished, they attempted to create, using various technological and ecological means, a new environment among the fragments of stone left in the quarry.  \"Nature should not be returned to its natural state,\" Danziger contended. \"A system needs to be found to re-use the nature which has been created as material for an entirely new concept.\"<ref>From \"Rehabilitation of the Nesher Quarry, Israel Museum, 1972, \" in: Yona Fischer, in Itzhak Danziger,  Place (Tel Aviv: Ha Kibbutz HaMeuhad Publishing House, 1982. [In Hebrew]</ref> After the first stage of the project, the attempt at rehabilitation was put on display in 1972 in an exhibit at the Israel Museum.\n\nIn 1973 Danziger began to collect material for a book that would document his work.  Within the framework of the preparation for the book, he documented places of archaeological and contemporary ritual in Israel, places which had become the sources of inspiration for his work. The book, ''Makom'' (in [[Hebrew]] - ''place''), was published in 1982, after Danziger's death, and presented photographs of these places along with Danziger's sculptures, exercises in design,  sketches of his works and ecological ideas, displayed as \"sculpture\" with the values of abstract art, such as collecting rainwater, etc.  One of the places documented in the book is Bustan Hayat  [could not confirm English spelling-sl ] at Nachal Siach in Haifa, which was built by Aziz Hayat in 1936. Within the framework of classes he gave at the Technion, Danziger conducted experiments in design with his students, involving them also with the care and upkeep of the Bustan.\n\nIn 1977 a planting ceremony was conducted in the [[Golan Heights]] for 350 Oak saplings, being planted as a memorial to the fallen soldiers of the Egoz Unit.  Danziger, who was serving as a judge in \"the competition for the planning and implementation of the memorial to the Northern Commando Unit,\" suggested that instead of a memorial sculpture, they put their emphasis on the landscape itself, and on a site that would be different from the usual memorial. \u201dWe felt that any vertical structure, even the most impressive, could not compete with the mountain range itself. When we started climbing up to the site, we discovered that the rocks, that looked from a distance like texture, had a personality all of their own up close.\"<ref>Itzhak Danziger, The Project for the Memorial to the Fallen Soldiers of the Egoz Commando Unit.  [In Hebrew]</ref> This perception derived from research in Bedouin and Palestinian ritual sites in the Land of Israel,  sites in which the trees serve both as a symbol next to the graves of saints and as a ritual focus, \"on which they hang colorful shiny blue and green fabrics from the oaks [...]  People go out to hang these fabrics because of a spiritual need, they go out to make a wish.\"<ref>] Amnon Barzel, \u201cLandscape as an Artistic Creation\u201d (Interview with Itzhak Danziger), Haaretz (July 27, 1977). [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nIn 1972 group of young artists who were in touch with Danziger and influenced by his ideas created a group of activities that became known as \"Metzer-Messer\"  in the area between [[Kibbutz]] [[Metzer]] and the Arab village [[Meiser]] in the north west section of the Shomron. [[Micha Ullman]], with the help of youth from both the kibbutz and the village, dug a hole in each of the communities and implemented an exchange of symbolic red soil between them. [[Moshe Gershuni]] called a meeting of the kibbutz members and handed out the soil of Kibbutz Metzer to them there, and [[Avital Geva]] created in the area between the two communities an improvised library of books recycled from Amnir Recycling Industries.<ref>See: Ginton Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 88\u201389.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nAnother artist influenced by Danziger's ideas was [[Yigal Tumarkin]], who at the end of the 1970s, created a series of works entitled, \"Definitions of Olive Trees and Oaks,\" in which he created temporary sculpture around trees. Like Danziger, Tumarkin also related in these works to the life forms of popular culture, particularly in Arab and Bedouin villages, and created from them a sort of artistic-morphological language, using \"impoverished\" bricolage methods.  Some of the works related not only to coexistence and peace, but also to the larger Israeli political picture.   In works such as \"Earth Crucifixion\" (1981) and \"Bedouin Crucifixion\" (1982), Tumarkin referred to the ejection of Palestinians and Bedouins from their lands, and created \"crucifixion pillars\" for these lands.<ref>Yigal Zalmona, Onward: The East in Israeli Art (Jerusalem: The Israel Museum, 1998), pp. 82\u201383.  For documentation of much of Danziger\u2019s sculptural activity, see Igael Tumarkin, Trees, Stones, and Fabrics in the Wind (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1981. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nAnother group that operated in a similar spirit, while at the same time emphasizing Jewish metaphysics, was the group known as the \"Leviathians,\" presided over by Avraham Ofek, Michail Grobman, and Shmuel Ackerman.  The group combined conceptual art and \"land art\" with Jewish symbolism.  Of the three of them, Avraham Ofek had the deepest interest in sculpture and its relationship to religious symbolism and images.  In one series of his works Ofek used mirrors to project Hebrew letters, words with religious or cabbalistic significance, and other images onto soil or man-made structures.  In his work \"Letters of Light\" (1979), for example, the letters were projected onto people and fabrics and the soil of the Judean Desert.   In another work Ofek screened the words \"America,\" \"Africa,\" and \"Green card\" on the walls of the Tel Hai courtyard during a symposium on sculpture.<ref>] See: The Story of Israeli Art, Benjamin Tammuz, Editor (Jerusalem: Masada Publishing House, 1980), pp. 238\u2013240.

The artistic style he developed in those years was heavily influenced by English art of this period, such as the works of Anthony Caro, who was one of his teachers. At the same time his work was permeated by the relationship between landscape and ritual objects, like Danziger and other Israeli sculptors. During his stay in Europe, Kadishman created a number of totemic images of people, gates, and altars of a talismanic and primitive nature.<ref>] Pierre Restany, Kadishman (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1996), pp. 43-48. [In Hebrew]</ref> Some of these works, such as \"Suspense\" (1966), or \"Uprise\" (1967\u20131976), developed into pure geometric figures.\n\nAt the end of this decade, in works such as \"Aqueduct\" (1968\u20131970) or \"Segments\" (1969), Kadishman combined pieces of glass separating chunks of stone with a tension of form between the different parts of the sculpture.  With his return to Israel at the beginning of the 1970s, Kadishman began to create works that were clearly in the spirit of \"Land Art.\"  One of his main projects was carried out in 1972.  In the framework of this project Kadishman painted a square in yellow organic paint on the land of the Monastery of the Cross, in the Valley of the Cross at the foot of the Israel Museum. The work became known as a \"monument of global nature, in which the landscape depicted by it is both the subject and the object of the creative process.\"<ref>Pierre Restany, Kadishman (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1996), p. 127. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nOther Israeli artists also created abstract sculptures charged with symbolism. The sculptures of [[Michael Gross (artist)|Michael Gross]] created an abstraction of the Israeli landscape, while those of [[Yaacov Agam]] contained a Jewish theological aspect. His work was also innovative in its attempt to create [[kinetic art]]. Works of his such as \"18 Degrees\" (1971) not only eroded the boundary between the work and the viewer of the work but also exhorted the viewer to look at the work actively.\n\nSymbolism of a different kind can be seen in the work of [[Dani Karavan]]. The outdoor sculptures that Karavan created, from \"[[Monument to the Negev Brigade]]\" (1963-1968) to \"White Square\" (1989) utilized avant-garde European art to create a symbolic abstraction of the Israeli landscape. In Karavan's use of the techniques of modernist, and primarily brutalist, architecture, as in his museum installations, Karavan created a sort of alternative environment to landscapes, redesigning it as a utopia, or as a call for a dialogue with these landscapes.<ref>See: Ruti Director, \u201cWhen Politics Becomes Kitsch,\u201d Studio, no. 92 (April 1998), pp. 28\u201333.</ref>\n\nMicha Ullman continued and developed the concept of nature and the structure of the excavations he carried out on systems of underground structures formulated according to a minimalist aesthetic.  These structures, like the work \"Third Watch\" (1980), which are presented as defense trenches made of dirt, are also presented as the place which housed the beginning of permanent human existence.<ref>See: Amnon Barzel, Israel: The 1980 Biennale (Jerusalem: Ministry of Education, 1980). [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\n[[Buky Schwartz]] absorbed concepts from conceptual art, primarily of the American variety, during the period that he lived in [[New York City]]. Schwartz's work dealt with the way the relationship between the viewer and the work of art is constructed and deconstructed. In the [[video art]] film \"Video Structures\" (1978-1980) Schwartz demonstrated the dismantling of the geometric illusion using optical methods, that is, marking an illusory form in space and then dismantling this illusion when the human body is interposed.<ref>See: Video Zero:  Written on the Body \u2013 A Live Transmission, the Screened Image \u2013 the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006), p. 48, pp. 70\u201371. [In Hebrew]</ref> In sculptures such as \"Levitation\" (1976) or \"Reflection Triangle\" (1980), Schwartz dismantled the serious geometry of his sculptures by inserting mirrors that produced the illusion that they were floating in the air, similarly to Kadishman's works in glass.\n\n===Representative sculpture of the 1970s===\n\n[[Performance art]] began to develop in the [[United States]] in the 1960s, trickling into Israeli art towards the end of that decade under the auspices of the \"[[Ten Plus]]\" group, led by [[Raffi Lavie]] and the \"[[Third Eye (performance artists)|Third Eye]]\" group, under the leadership of [[Jacques Cathmore]].<ref>See: Video Zero:  Written on the Body -- A Live Transmission, the Screened Image \u2013 the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006) pp. 35\u201336. [In Hebrew]</ref>  A large number of sculptors took advantage of the possibilities that the techniques of Performance Art opened for them with regard to a critical examination of the space around them.  In spite of the fact that many works renounced the need for genuine physical expression, nevertheless the examination they carry out shows the clear way in which the artists related to physical space from the point of view of social, political, and gender issues.\n\n[[Pinchas Cohen Gan]] during those years created a number of displays of a political nature.  In his work \"Touching the Border\" (January 7, 1974) iron missiles, with Israeli demographic information written on them, were sent to Israel's border. The missiles were buried at the spot where the Israelis carrying them were arrested. In \"Performance in a Refugees Camp in Jericho\", which took place on February 10, 1974 in the northeast section of the city of Jericho near [[Khirbat al-Mafjar]] (Hisham's Palace), Cohen created a link between his personal experience as an immigrant and the experience of the Palestinian immigrant, by building a tent and a structure that looked like the sail of a boat, which was also made of fabric. At the same time, Cohen Gan set up a conversation about \"Israel 25 Years Hence\", in the year 2000, between two refugees, and accompanied by the declaration, \"A refugee is a person who cannot return to his homeland.\"<ref>See: Jonathan Allen, The Eyes of the Country: Visual Arts in a Country Without Borders  (Tel Aviv: Tel Aviv Museum of Art, 1998), pp. 142\u2013151.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nAnother artist, [[Efrat Natan]], created a number of performances dealing with the dissolution of the connection between the viewer and the work of art, at the same time criticizing Israeli militarism after the Six Day War. Among her important works was \"Head Sculpture,\" in which Natan consulted a sort of wooden sculpture which she wore as a kind of mask on her head. Natan wore the sculpture the day after the army's annual military parade in 1973, and walked with it to various central places in Tel Aviv. The form of the mask, in the shape of the letter \"T,\" bore a resemblance to a cross or an airplane and restricted her field of vision.\"<ref>See: Video Zero:  Written on the Body -- A Live Transmission, the Screened Image \u2013 the First Decade, edited by Ilana Tannenbaum (Haifa: Haifa Museum of Art, 2006), p. 43. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nA blend of political and artistic criticism with poetics can be seen in a number of paintings and installations that Moshe Gershuni created in the 1970s. For Gershuni, who began to be famous during these years as a conceptual sculptor, art and the definition of esthetics was perceived as parallel and inseparable from politics in Israel. Thus, in his work \"A Gentle Hand\" (1975\u20131978), Gershuni juxtaposed a newspaper article describing abuse of a Palestinian with a famous love song by [[Zalman Shneur]] (called: \"All Her Heart She Gave Him\" and the first words of which are \"A gentle hand\", sung to an Arab melody from the days of the Second Aliyah (1904\u20131914). Gershuni sang like a muezzin into a loudspeaker placed on the roof of the Tel Aviv Museum. In works like these the minimalist and conceptualist ethics served as a tool for criticizing Zionism and Israeli society.<ref>See: Irit Segoli, \u201cMy Red is Your Dear Blood,\u201d Studio, No. 76 (October\u2013November 1996), pp. 38\u201339. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n[[File:Gideon Gechtman hasifa 005.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Exposure (Installation view), 1975 by [[Gideon Gechtman]]]]\nThe works of [[Gideon Gechtman]] during this period dealt with the complex relationship between art and the life of the artist, and with the dialectic between artistic representation and real life.<ref>See: Gideon Efrat, \u201cThe Heart of the Matter,\u201d Gideon Gechtman: Works 1971-1986, Autumn 1986, unnumbered. [In Hebrew]</ref> In the exhibition \"Exposure\" (1975), Gechtman described the ritual of shaving his body hair in preparation for heart surgery he had undergone, and used photographed documentation like doctors' letters and x-rays which showed the artificial heart valve implanted in his body. In other works, such as \"Brushes\" (1974\u20131975), he uses hair from his head and the heads of family members and attaches it to different kinds of brushes, which he exhibits in wooden boxes, as a kind of box of ruins (a reliquary). These boxes were created according to strict minimalistic esthetic standards.\n\nAnother major work of Gechtman's during this period was exhibited in the exhibition entitled \"Open Workshop\" (1975) at the [[Israel Museum]]. The exhibition summarized the sociopolitical \"activity\" known as \"Jewish Work\" and, within this framework,\" Gechtman participated as a construction worker in the building of a new wing of the Museum and lived within the exhibition space.  on the construction site.  Gechtman also hung obituaries bearing the name \"Jewish Work\" and a photograph of the homes of Arab workers on the construction site.  In spite of the clearly political aspects of this work, its complex relationship to the image of the artist in society is also evident.\n\n==1980s and 1990s==\nIn the 1980s, influences from the international postmodern discourse began to trickle into Israeli art. Particularly important was the influence of philosophers such as Jacques Derrida and Jean Baudrillard, who formulated the concept of the semantic and relative nature of reality in their philosophical writings. The idea that the artistic representation is composed of \"simulacra\", objects in which the internal relation between the signifier and the signified is not direct, created a feeling that the status of the artistic object in general, and of sculpture in particular, was being undermined.\n\nGideon Gechtman's work expresses the transition from the conceptual approach of the 1970s to the 1980s, when new strategies were adopted that took real objects (death notices, a hospital, a child's wagon) and gradually converted them into objects of art.<ref>See: Neta Gal-Atzmon, \u201cCycles of Original and Imitation: Works 1973-2003,\u201d in Gideon Gechtman, Hedva, Gideon, and All the Rest (Tel Aviv: Association of Painters and Sculptors) (Unnumbered looseleaf folder).  [In Hebrew]</ref> The real objects were recreated in various artificial materials.  Death notices, for example, were made out of colored neon lights, like those used in advertisements.  Other materials Gechtman used in this period were formica and imitation marble, which in themselves emphasized the artificiality of the artistic representation and its non-biographical nature.\n\n[[File:Nahum Tevet, Painting Lesson, no 5.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Nahum Tevet]]<br>Painting Lesson, no 5, 1986<br>Acrylic and industrial paint on wood; found object<br>[[Israel Museum]] collection]]\nDuring the 1980s, the works of a number of sculptors were known for their use of plywood. The use of this material served to emphasize the way large-scale objects were constructed, often within the tradition of do-it-yourself carpentry. The concept behind this kind of sculpture emphasized the non-heroic nature of a work of art, related to the \"Arte Povera\" style, which was at the height of its influence during these years. Among the most conspicuous of the artists who first used these methods is [[Nahum Tevet]], who began his career in the 1970s as a sculptor in the minimalist and conceptual style. While in the early 1970s he used a severe, nearly monastic, style in his works, from the beginning of the 1980s he began to construct works that were more and more complex, composed of disassembled parts, built in home-based workshops. The works are described as \"a trap configuration, which seduces the eye into penetrating the content [...] but is revealed as a false temptation that blocks the way rather than leading somewhere.\"<ref>Sarit Shapira, One Thing at a Time (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2007), p. 21. [In Hebrew]</ref> The group of sculptors who called themselves \"Drawing Lessons,\"  from the middle of the decade, and other works, such as \"Ursa Major (with eclipse)\" (1984) and \"Jemmain\" (1986)  created a variety of points of view, disorder, and spatial disorientation, which \"demonstrate the subject's loss of stability in the postmodernist world.\"<ref>See: Nahum Tevet in the \u201cCheck-Post\u201d exhibition (Website of the Haifa Museum of Art).</ref>\n\nThe sculptures of [[Drora Domini]] as well dealt with the construction and deconstruction of structures with a domestic connection.  Many of them featured disassembled images of furniture.  The abstract structures she built, on a relatively small scale, contained absurd connections between them.  Towards the end of the decade Domini began to combine additional images in her works from compositions in the \"ars poetica\" style.<ref>See: Drora Dumani in the \u201cCheck-Post\u201d exhibition (Website of the Haifa Museum of Art).</ref>\n\nAnother artist who created wooden structures  was the sculptor [[Isaac Golombek]]. His works from the end of the decade included familiar objects reconstructed from plywood and with their natural proportions distorted.  The items he produced had structures one on top of another. [[Itamar Levy]], in his article \"High Low Profile\" [Rosh katan godol],<ref>See: Itamar Levy, \u201cHigh Low Profile,\u201d Studio: Journal of Art, No. 111 (February 2000), pp. 38-45.  [In Hebrew]</ref> describes the relationship between the viewer and Golombek's works as an experiment in the separation of the sense of sight from the senses of touching and feeling. The bodies that Golombek describes are dismantled bodies, conducting a protest dialogue against the gaze of the viewer, who aspires to determine one unique, protected, and explainable identity for the work of art. While the form of the object represents a clear identity, the way they are made distances the usefulness of the objects and disrupts the feeling of materiality of the items.\n\nA different kind of construction can be seen in the performances of the [[Zik Group]], which came into being in the middle of the 1980s. Within the framework of its performances, the Group built large-scale wooden sculptures and created ritualistic activities around them, combining a variety of artistic techniques. When the performance ended, they set fire to the sculpture in a public burning ceremony. In the 1990s, in addition to destruction, the group also took began to focus on the transformation of materials and did away with the public burning ceremonies.<ref>The Zik Group: Twenty Years of Work, edited by Daphna Ben-Shaul (Jerusalem: Keter Publishing House, 2005).  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\n===Postmodern trends===\n[[File:S chen3.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Sigal Primor]]<br>Untitled, 1989<br>Stainless steel]]\n[[File:Belu Simion Fainaru.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Belu-Simion Fainaru]]<br>Sham (There), 1996 <br>stone]]\n[[File:Sigalit Landau the country 13.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sigalit Landau]]<br>The Country (Installation view), 2002<br>Mixed Media ]]\n[[File:AND EUROPE WILL BE STUNNED.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Yael Bartana]]<br>...And Europe Will Be Stunned, 2012<br>Neon Light]]\nAnother effect of the postmodern approach was the protest against historical and cultural narratives. Art was not yet perceived as ideology, supporting or opposing the discourse on Israeli hegemony, but rather as the basis for a more open and pluralistic discussion of reality.  In the era following the \"political revolution\"  which resulted from the 1977 election, this was expressed in the establishment of the \"identity discussion,\" in which parts of society that up to now had not usually been represented in the main Israeli discourse were included.\n\nIn the beginning of the 1980s expressions of the trauma of the [[Holocaust]] began to appear in Israeli society. In the works of the \"second generation\" there began to appear figures taken from [[World War II]], combined with an attempt to establish a personal identity as an Israeli and as a Jew.  Among the pioneering works were [[Moshe Gershuni]]'s installation \"Red Sealing/Theatre\" (1980) and the works of [[Haim Maor]]. These expressions became more and more explicit in the 1990s. A large group of works was created by [[Igael Tumarkin]], who combined in his monumental creations dialectical images representing the horrors of the Holocaust with the world of European culture in which it occurred. The artist [[Penny Yassour]], for example, represented the Holocaust in a series of structures and models in which hints and quotes referring to the war appear. In the work \"Screens\" (1996), which was displayed at the \"Documenta\" exhibition, Yassour created a map of German trains in 1938 in the form of a table made out of rubber, as part of an experiment to present the memory and describe the relationship between private and public memory.<ref>] See: Galia Bar Or, \u201cParodoxical Space,\u201d Studio, No. 109 (November\u2013December 1999), pp. 45\u201353. [In Hebrew]</ref> The other materials Yassour used \u2013 metal and wood that created different architectonic spaces \u2013 produced an atmosphere of isolation and horror.\n\nAnother aspect of raising the memory of the Holocaust to the public consciousness was the focus on the immigrants who came to Israel during the first decades after the founding of the State.  These attempts were accompanied by a protest against the image of the Israeli \"[[Sabra (person)|Sabra]]\" and an emphasis on the feeling of detachment of the immigrants. The sculptor [[Philip Rentzer]] presented, in a number of works and installations, the image of the immigrant and the refugee in Israel.  His works, constructed from an assemblage of various ready-made materials, show the contrast between the permanence of the domestic and the feeling of impermanence of the immigrant. In his installation \"The Box from Nes Ziona\" (1998), Rentzer created an Orientalist camel carrying on its back the immigrants' shack of Rentzer's family, represented by skeletons carrying ladders.<ref>See: \u201cImmigrant With a Compulsion,\u201d Ynet  website: http://www.ynet.co.il/articles/0,7340,L-3476177,00.html   [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nIn addition to expressions of the Holocaust, a growing expression of the motifs of Jewish art can be seen in Israeli art of the 1990s. In spite of the fact that motifs of this kind could be seen in the past in art of such artists as [[Arie Aroch]], [[Moshe Castel]], and [[Mordechai Ardon]], the works of Israeli artists of the 1990s displayed a more direct relationship to the world of Jewish symbols. One of the most visible of the artists who used these motifs, [[Belu Simion Fainaru]] used Hebrew letters  and other symbols as the basis for the creation of objects with metaphysical-religious significance. In his work \"Sham\" (\"There\" in Hebrew) (1996), for example, Fainaru created a closed structure, with windows in the form of the Hebrew letter [[Shin (letter)|Shin]] (\u05e9). In another work, he made a model of a synagogue (1997), with windows in the shape of the letters, [[Aleph]] (\u05d0) to [[Zayin]] (\u05d6) - one to seven - representing the seven days of the creation of the world.<ref>David Schwarber, Ifcha Mistabra: The Culture of the Temple and Contemporary Israeli Art (Ramat Gan: Bar Ilan University), pp. 46\u201347.  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nDuring the 1990s we also begin to see various representations of [[Gender]] and sexual motifs.  [[Sigal Primor]] exhibited works that dealt with the image of women in Western culture.  In an environmental sculpture she placed on Sderot Chen in Tel Aviv-Jaffa, Primor created a replica of furniture made of stainless steel. In this way, the structure points out the gap between personal, private space and public space. In many of Primor's works there is an ironic relationship to the motif of the \"bride\", as seen Marcel Duchamp's work, \"The Glass Door\". In her work \"The Bride\", materials such as cast iron, combined with images using other techniques such as photography, become objects of desire.\n\nIn her installation \"Dinner Dress (Tales About Dora)\" (1997), [[Tamar Raban]] turned a dining room table four meters in diameter into a huge crinoline and she organized an installation that took place both on top of and under the dining room table. The public was invited to participate in the meal prepared by chef Tsachi  Bukshester and watch what was going on under the table on monitors placed under the transparent glass dinner plates.<ref>For documentation on the installation, see: \u201cDinner Dress\u201d and the associated video on YouTube.</ref> The installation raises questions about the perceptions of memory and personal identity in a variety of ways.  During the performance, Raban would tell stories about \"Dora,\" Raban's mother 's name, with reference to the figure \"Dora\" \u2013 a nickname for [[Ida Bauer]], one of the historic patients of [[Sigmund Freud]]. In the corner of the room was the artist [[Pnina Reichman]], embroidering words and letters in English, such as \"all those lost words\" and \"contaminated memory,\" and counting in [[Yiddish]].<ref>See: Levia Stern, \u201cConversations About Dora,\u201d Studio: Journal of Art, No. 91 (March 1998), pp. 34\u201337. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nThe centrality of the gender discussion in the international cultural and art scene had an influence on Israeli artists. In the video art works of [[Hila Lulu Lin]], the protest against the traditional concepts of women's sexuality stood out. In her work \"No More Tears\" (1994), Lulu Lin appeared passing an egg yolk back and forth between her hand and her mouth. Other artists sought not only to express in their art homoeroticism and feelings of horror and death, but also to test the social legitimacy of homosexuality and lesbianism in Israel. Among these artists the creative team of [[Nir Nader]] and [[Erez Harodi]], and the performance artist [[Dan Zakheim]] stand out.\n\nAs the world of Israeli art was exposed to the art of the rest of the world, especially from the 1990s, a striving toward the \"total visual experience,\"<ref>Amitai Mendelson, \u201cThe Opening and Closing Spectacles: Rumblings About Art in Israel,1998-2007,\u201d Real-time (Jerusalem: Israel Museum, 2008).  [In Hebrew]</ref> expressed in large-scale installations and in the use of theatrical technologies, particularly of video art, can be seen in the works of many Israeli artists.  The subject of many of these installations is a critical test of space. Among these artists can be found [[Ohad Meromi]] and [[Michal Rovner]], who creates video installations in which human activities are converted into ornamental designs of texts. In the works of [[Uri Tzaig]] the use of video to test the activity of the viewer as a critical activity stands out. In \"Universal Square\" (2006), for example, Tzaig created a video art film in which two football teams compete on a field with two balls. The change in the regular rules created a variety of opportunities for the players to come up with new plays on the space of the football field.\n\nAnother well-known artist who creates large-scale installations is [[Sigalit Landau]]. Landau creates expressive environments with multiple sculptures laden with political and social allegorical significance. The apocalyptic exhibitions Landau mounted, such as \"The Country\" (2002) or \"Endless Solution\" (2005), succeeded in reaching large and varied segments of the population.\n\n==Commemorative sculpture==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 13833 Memorial Garden in Rehovot.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Monument for the Fallen in the War of Indeependence (1949) by [[Dov Feigin]] at [[Rehovot]]]]\n[[File:Negba Monument003 1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Monument at Kibbuz Negba (1953) by [[Natan Rapoport]]]]\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 32072 Holocaust and Resurrection.JPG|thumb|right|250px|[[Monument to the Holocaust]] (1975) by [[Igael Tumarkin]].

Since the memorial sculptures are displayed in public spaces, they tend to serve as an expression of popular art of the period.  The first memorial sculpture erected in the Land of Israel was \u201c[[The Roaring Lion]]\u201d, which [[Abraham Melnikoff]] sculpted in [[Tel Hai]]. The large proportions of the statue and the public funding that Melnikoff recruited towards its construction, was an innovation for the small Israeli art scene. From a sculptural standpoint, the statue was connected to the beginnings of the \u201cCaananite\u201d movement in art.\n\nThe memorial sculptures erected in Israel up to the beginning of the 1950s, most of which were memorials for the fallen soldiers of the War of Independence, were characterized for the most part by their figurative subjects and elegiac overtones, which were aimed at the emotions of the Zionist Israeli public.<ref>See: Gideon Efrat, \u201cThe Dialectic of the 1950s: Hegemony and Multiciplicity,\u201d  in: Gideon Efrat and Galia Bar Or, The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity  (Kibbutz Ein Harod, Haim Atar Museum of Art, 2008), p. 18. [In Hebrew]</ref>  The structure of the memorials was designed as spatial theater.  The accepted model for the memorial included a wall with a wall covered in stone or marble, the back of which remained unused. On it, the names of the fallen soldiers were engraved. Alongside this was a relief of a wounded soldier or an allegorical description, such as descriptions of lions.  A number of memorial sculptures were erected as the central structure on a ceremonial surface meant to be viewed from all sides.<ref>See: Avner  Ben-Amos, \u201cThe Theater of Memory and Death: Memorials and Ceremonies in Israel,\u201d in Drora Dumani, Everywhere: Israeli Landscape with Memorial  (Tel Aviv: Hargol, 2002).  [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nIn the design of these memorial sculptures we can see significant differences among the accepted patterns of memory of that period. [[Hashomer Hatzair]] (The Youth Guard) kibbutzim, for example, erected heroic memorial sculptures, such as the sculptures erected on Kibbutz [[Yad Mordechai]] (1951) or Kibbutz [[Negba]] (1953), which were expressionist attempts to emphasize the ideological and social connections between art and the presence of public expression.  Within the framework of [[HaKibbutz Ha\u2019Artzi]] intimate memorial sculptures were erected, such as the memorial sculpture \u201cMother and Child\u201d, which [[Chana Orloff]] erected at Kibbutz [[Ein Gev]] (1954) or [[Yechiel Shemi|Yechiel Shemi's]] sculpture on Kibbutz Hasolelim (1954).  These sculptures emphasized the private world of the individual and tended toward the abstract.<ref>See: Galia Bar Or, \u201cUniversal and International: The Art of the Kibbutz in the First Decade,\u201d in Gideon Efrat and Galia Bar Or, The First Decade: Hegemony and Multiciplicity  (Kibbutz Ein Harod, Haim Atar Museum of Art, 2008), p. 88. [In Hebrew]</ref>\n\nOne of the most famous memorial sculptors during the first decades after the founding of the State of Israel was [[Nathan Rapoport]], who immigrated to Israel in 1950, after he had already erected a memorial sculpture in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] to the fighters of the Ghetto (1946\u20131948).  Rapoport\u2019s many memorial sculptures, erected as memorials on government sites and on sites connected to the War of Independence, were representatives of sculptural expressionism, which took its inspiration from Neoclassicism as well. At Warsaw Ghetto Square at Yad Vashem (1971), Rapoport created a relief entitled \u201cThe Last March\u201d, which depicts a group of Jews holding a Torah scroll. To the left of this, Rapoport erected a copy of the sculpture he created for the Warsaw Ghetto. In this way, a \u201cZionist narrative\u201d of the Holocaust was created, emphasizing the heroism of the victims alongside the mourning.\n\nIn contrast to the figurative art which had characterized it earlier, from the 1950s on a growing tendency towards abstraction began to appear in memorial sculpture. At the center of the \u201cPilots\u2019 Memorial\" (1950s), erected by [[Benjamin Tammuz]] and [[Aba Elhanani]] in the Independence Park in Tel Aviv-Yaffo, stands an image of a bird flying above a Tel Aviv seaside cliff. The tendency toward the abstract can also be seen the work by [[David Palombo]], who created reliefs and memorial sculptures for government institutions like the Knesset and Yad Vashem, and in many other works, such as the memorial to [[Shlomo Ben-Yosef]] that [[Itzhak Danziger]] erected in [[Rosh Pina]]. However, the epitome of this trend toward avoidance of figurative images stands our starkly in the \u201cMonument to the Negev Brigade\u201d (1963\u20131968) which [[Dani Karavan]] created on the outskirts of the city of [[Beersheva]]. The monument was planned as a structure made of exposed concrete occasionally adorned with elements of metaphorical significance. The structure was an attempt to create a physical connection between itself and the desert landscape in which it stands, a connection conceptualized in the way the visitor wanders and views the landscape from within the structure. A mixture of symbolism and abstraction can be found in the \u201cMonument to the Holocaust and National Revival\u201d, erected in Tel Aviv\u2019s [[Rabin Square]] (then \u201cKings of Israel Square\u201d). [[Igael Tumarkin]], creator of the sculpture, used elements that created the symbolic form of an inverted pyramid made of metal, concrete, and glass. In spite of the fact that the glass is supposed to reflect what is happening in this urban space,<ref>Yigal Tumarkin, \"Monument to the Holocaust and Revival\", in Tumarkin (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1991 (unnumbered pages)</ref> the monument didn\u2019t express the desire for the creation of a new space which would carry on a dialogue with the landscape of the \u201cLand of Israel\u201d. The pyramid sits on a triangular base, painted yellow, reminiscent of the \u201cMark of Cain\u201d. The two structures together form a [[Magen David]].  Tumarkin saw in this form \u201ca prison cell that has been opened and breached. An overturned pyramid, which contains within itself, imprisoned in its base, the confined and the burdensome.\u201d<ref>] Yigal Tumarkin, \"Monument to the Holocaust and Revival\", in Tumarkin (Tel Aviv: Masada Publishing House, 1991 (unnumbered pages)</ref> The form of the pyramid shows up in another work of the artists as well. In a late interview with him, Tumarkin confided that the pyramid can be perceived also as the gap between ideology and its enslaved results: \u201cWhat have we learned since the great pyramids were built 4200 years ago?[...]  Do works of forced labor and death liberate?\u201d<ref>Michal K. Marcus, In the Spacious Time of Yigal Tumarkin.</ref>\n\nIn the 1990s memorial sculptures began to be built in a theatrical style, abandoning the abstract. In the \u201cChildren\u2019s Memorial\u201d (1987), or the \u201cYad Vashem Train Car\u201d (1990) by [[Moshe Safdie]], or in the Memorial to the victims of \u201cThe Israeli Helicopter Disaster\u201d (2008), alongside the use of symbolic forms, we see the trend towards the use of various techniques to intensify the emotional experience of the viewer.\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:\u05d1\u05d9\u05ea \u05e8\u05d5\u05e7\u05d713.JPG|thumb|250px|Women sculptures of Lea Majaro-Mintz]]\nAttitudes toward the realistic depiction of the human body are complex. The birth of Israeli sculpture took place concurrently with the flowering of avantgarde and modernist European art, whose influence on sculpture from the 1930s to the present day is significant. In the 1940s the trend toward primitivism among local artists was dominant.  With the appearance of \u201cCanaanite\u201d art we see an expression of the opposite concept of the human body, as part of the image of the landscape of \u201cThe Land of Israel.\u201d That same desolate desert landscape became a central motif in many works of art until the 1980s.  With regard to materials, we see a small amount of use of stone and marble in traditional techniques of excavation and carving, and a preference for casting and welding. This phenomenon was dominant primarily in the 1950s, as a result of the popularity of the abstract sculpture of the \u201cNew Horizons\u201d group. In addition, this sculpture enabled artists to create art on a monumental scale, which was not common in Israeli art until then.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Visual arts in Israel]]\n*[[List of public art in Israel]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n[[Category:Israeli art]]\n[[Category:Israeli culture]]\n", "name_user": "Will Sandberg", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eCaananite to abstract, 1939\u20131967", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_sculpture"}

For this purpose, the GGSN stores the current SGSN address of the user and his or her profile in its location register. The GGSN is responsible for IP address assignment and is the default router for the connected user equipment (UE). The GGSN also performs authentication and charging functions.\n\nOther functions include subscriber screening, [[Address pool|IP pool]] management and [[IP address#Modifications to IP addressing|address mapping]], [[Quality of service|QoS]] and PDP context enforcement.\n\nWith [[Long Term Evolution|LTE]] scenario the GGSN functionality moves to [[System Architecture Evolution|SAE]] gateway (with SGSN functionality working in [[Mobility Management Entity|MME]]).\n\n===Serving GPRS support node (SGSN)===\nThe Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)<ref name=\"3GPP_23.002\" /> is the node that is serving the [[Mobile station|MS]]/[[User equipment|UE]].

Its tasks include packet routing and transfer, mobility management (attach/detach and location management), logical link management, and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN stores location information (e.g., current cell, current [[Visitor Location Register|VLR]]) and user profiles (e.g., [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]], address(es) used in the packet data network) of all GPRS users registered with it.\n\n====Common SGSN functions====\n* Detunnel GTP packets from the GGSN (downlink)\n* Tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN (uplink)\n* Carry out mobility management when a standby mode mobile moves from one routing area to another routing area\n* Billing a user according to data used.\n* Mobile Equipment Identity Check Procedure (Gf/S13' interfaces).\n* The SMS GMSCs and SMS IWMSCs support SMS transmission via the SGSN.<ref>3GPP TS 23.060 V14.3.0 (2017-03), p.24</ref>\n* The Offline Charging System (OFCS) collects charging records from SGSNs.<ref name=\"3GPP TS 23.060 V14.3.0 (2017-03), p.23\" />\n* The SGSN contains mechanisms for avoiding and handling overload situations. <ref>3GPP TS 23.060 V14.3.0 (2017-03), p.35</ref>\n* The SGSN communicate with other SGSN(s) and/or MME(s) ([[Mobility Management Entity]]) (Gn/S16/S3 interfaces)\n\n====GSM/EDGE specific SGSN functions====\n[[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE) specific SGSN functions and characteristics are:\n* Maximum data rate of approx. 60&nbsp;kbit/s (150&nbsp;kbit/s for EDGE) per subscriber\n* Connect via [[frame relay]] or [[Internet protocol|IP]] to the [[Base Station Subsystem#Packet control unit|packet control unit]] using the Gb protocol stack\n* Accept uplink data to form IP packets\n* Encrypt down-link data, decrypt up-link data\n* Carry out mobility management to the level of a [[radio cell|cell]] for connected mode mobiles\n\n====WCDMA specific SGSN functions====\n* Carry up to about 42&nbsp;Mbit/s traffic downlink and 5.8&nbsp;Mbit/s traffic uplink (HSPA+)\n* Tunnel/detunnel downlink/uplink packets toward the [[Radio Network Controller|radio network controller]] (RNC)\n*\n\n==Access point==\n{{main|Access Point Name}}\n\nAn access point is:\n* An IP network to which a mobile set can be connected\n* A set of settings which are used for that connection\n* A particular option in a set of settings in a mobile phone\n\nWhen a GPRS mobile phone sets up a PDP context, the access point\nis selected.  At this point an [[Access Point Name]] (APN) is\ndetermined\n\n:Example: aricenttechnologies.mnc012.mcc345.gprs\n:Example: geocell\n:Example: internet\n:Example: hcl.cisco.ggsn\n\nThis access point is then used in a [[Domain Name System|DNS]] query to a private DNS\nnetwork.  This process (called APN resolution) finally gives the IP\naddress of the GGSN which should serve the access point.  At this\npoint a PDP context can be activated.\n\n==PDP context==\nThe packet data protocol (PDP; e.g., IP, X.25, FrameRelay) context is a [[data structure]] present on both the ''serving GPRS support node'' (SGSN) and the ''gateway GPRS support node'' (GGSN) which contains the subscriber's session information when the subscriber has an active session.\nWhen a mobile wants to use GPRS, it must first attach and then ''activate a PDP context''.\nThis allocates a PDP context data structure in the SGSN that the subscriber is currently visiting and the GGSN serving the subscriber's access point.  The data recorded includes\n\n* Subscriber's [[IP address]]\n* Subscriber's [[International Mobile Subscriber Identity|IMSI]]\n* Subscriber's Tunnel Endpoint ID (TEID) at the GGSN\n* Subscriber's Tunnel Endpoint ID (TEID) at the SGSN\n\n==Reference points and interfaces==\nWithin the GPRS core network standards there are a number of [[Network interface device|interface]]s and reference points (logical points of connection which probably share a common physical connection with other reference points).  Some of these names can be seen in the network structure diagram on this page.\n\n===Interfaces in the GPRS network===\n\n;Ga: The interface serves the CDRs (accounting-records) which are written in the GSN and sent to the charging gateway (CG).  This interface uses a GTP-based protocol, with modifications that supports CDRs (Called ''GTP' '' and ''GTP prime'').\n;Gb: Interface between the [[base station subsystem]] and the SGSN the transmission protocol could be Frame Relay or IP.\n;Iu: Interface between the Radio Network Controller and the SGSN. The interface exchanges signaling and payload. \n;Gc: Interface between the [[GGSN]] and [[Home Location Register|HLR]] so that the GGSN can get the location details of a [[mobile station]]. To avoid implementing MAP/SS7 in the GGSN, this interface is optional. When not present, the GGSN routes inquires to the HLR via an [[SGSN]].\n;Gd: Interface between the SGSN and the SMS Gateway. Can use MAP1, MAP2 or MAP3.\n;Ge: The interface between the SGSN and the [[Service Control Point|service control point]] (SCP); uses the [[CAMEL Application Part|CAP]] protocol.\n;Gf: The interface between the SGSN and the Equipment Identity Register (EIR), used for checking the mobile's equipment identity number (IMEI) against a list of reported stolen mobile phones.\n;Gi: IP based interface between the GGSN and a public data network (PDN) either directly to the [[Internet]] or through a [[WAP gateway]].\n;Gmb: The interface between the GGSN and the Broadcast-Multicast Service Center (BM-SC), used for controlling MBMS bearers.\n;Gn: IP based interface between SGSN and other SGSNs and (internal) GGSNs. [[Domain Name System|DNS]] also shares this interface. Uses the GTP Protocol.\n;Gp: IP based interface between internal SGSN and external GGSNs. Between the SGSN and the external GGSN, there is the border gateway (which is essentially a [[firewall (networking)|firewall]]). Also uses the GTP Protocol.\n;Gr: Interface between the SGSN and the HLR. Messages going through this interface uses the MAP3 protocol.\n;Gs: Interface between the SGSN and the MSC (VLR). Uses the [[BSSAP|BSSAP+]] protocol. This interface allows paging and station availability when it performs data transfer. When the station is attached to the GPRS network, the SGSN keeps track of which routing area (RA) the station is attached to. An RA is a part of a larger location area (LA). When a station is paged this information is used to conserve network resources. When the station performs a PDP context, the SGSN has the exact BTS the station is using.\n;Gx: The on-line policy interface between the GGSN and the charging rules function (CRF). It is used for provisioning service data flow based on charging rules. Uses the diameter protocol.\n;Gy: The on-line charging interface between the GGSN and the [[online charging system]] (OCS). Uses the diameter protocol ([[Diameter Credit-Control Application|DCCA application]]).\n;Gz: The off-line ([[Call detail record|CDR]]-based) charging interface between the GGSN and the Charging system Uses GTP'.\n;Lg: The interface between the SGSN and the Gateway Mobile Location Center ([[GMLC]]), used for location-based services.\n;S3: This interface is defined between the SGSN and the MME and it is used to exchange user and bearer information in inter-system mobility procedures. This interface is implemented using [[GPRS Tunnelling Protocol#GTP-C - GTP control|eGTP-C]].\n;S4: This interface is defined between the SGSN and the SGW (Serving Gateway). The term \"S4-SGSN\" refers to a Release-8 SGSN that has at least one set of S4/S3/S16 interfaces enabled.<ref>3GPP TS 29.303 version 10.1.0 Release 10, p.7</ref>\n;S6d: The interface between SGSN and Home Subscriber Server (HSS). It is a [[Diameter (protocol)|Diameter]] based interface which is used for  transferring subscription and authentication data of the user to HSS for authenticating and authorizing user access.\n;S13': This interface is defined between the SGSN and the EIR (Equipment Identity Register). The S13' interface applies only to the S4-based SGSN.<ref>SAE and the Evolved Packet Core: Driving the Mobile Broadband Revolution, p. 365</ref> The interface is based on Diameter protocol.\n;S16: This interface is defined between two SGSNs and exclusively uses GTPv2-C.<ref>SAE and the Evolved Packet Core: Driving the Mobile Broadband Revolution, p. 237-238</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Base station subsystem]]\n** [[Base station subsystem#Packet control unit|Packet control unit]]\n* [[Network switching subsystem]]\n\n==References==\n{{More footnotes|date=March 2009}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http://www.3gpp.org 3GPP web page including standards]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081030112056/http://www.3gpp.org/specs/numbering.htm easy access to different specs]\n* [http://www.eventhelix.com/RealtimeMantra/Telecom/gprs_attach_pdp_sequence_diagram.pdf GPRS attach and PDP context activation sequence diagrams]\n\n==Main Reference==\n* [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/23_series/23.060/23060-d40.zip 3GPP TS 23.060 V13.4.0 (2015-09)]\n\n{{Mobile telecommunications standards}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gprs Core Network}}\n[[Category:3GPP standards]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications infrastructure]]\n", "text_old": "The '''GPRS core network''' is the central part of the [[general packet radio service]] (GPRS) which allows [[2G]], [[3G]] and [[WCDMA]] [[mobile telephony|mobile networks]] to transmit [[Internet Protocol|IP]] packets to external networks such as the [[Internet]].

The SGSN is connected to the [[GERAN]] base station system through the Gb or Iu interface and/or to the [[UTRAN]] through the Iu interface.<ref name=\"3GPP TS 23.060 V14.3.0 (2017-03), p.23\">3GPP TS 23.060 V14.3.0 (2017-03), p.23</ref>\nA SGSN is responsible for the delivery of data packets from and to the mobile stations within its geographical service area. Its tasks include packet routing and transfer, mobility management (attach/detach and location management), logical link management, and authentication and charging functions. The location register of the SGSN stores location information (e.g., current cell, current [[Visitor Location Register|VLR]]) and user profiles (e.g., [[International mobile subscriber identity|IMSI]], address(es) used in the packet data network) of all GPRS users registered with it.\n\n====Common SGSN functions====\n* Detunnel GTP packets from the GGSN (downlink)\n* Tunnel IP packets toward the GGSN (uplink)\n* Carry out mobility management when a standby mode mobile moves from one routing area to another routing area\n* Billing a user according to data used.\n* Mobile Equipment Identity Check Procedure (Gf/S13' interfaces).\n* The SMS GMSCs and SMS IWMSCs support SMS transmission via the SGSN.<ref>3GPP TS 23.060 V14.3.0 (2017-03), p.24</ref>\n* The Offline Charging System (OFCS) collects charging records from SGSNs.<ref name=\"3GPP TS 23.060 V14.3.0 (2017-03), p.23\" />\n* The SGSN contains mechanisms for avoiding and handling overload situations. <ref>3GPP TS 23.060 V14.3.0 (2017-03), p.35</ref>\n* The SGSN communicate with other SGSN(s) and/or MME(s) ([[Mobility Management Entity]]) (Gn/S16/S3 interfaces)\n\n====GSM/EDGE specific SGSN functions====\n[[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]] (EDGE) specific SGSN functions and characteristics are:\n* Maximum data rate of approx. 60&nbsp;kbit/s (150&nbsp;kbit/s for EDGE) per subscriber\n* Connect via [[frame relay]] or [[Internet protocol|IP]] to the [[Base Station Subsystem#Packet control unit|packet control unit]] using the Gb protocol stack\n* Accept uplink data to form IP packets\n* Encrypt down-link data, decrypt up-link data\n* Carry out mobility management to the level of a [[radio cell|cell]] for connected mode mobiles\n\n====WCDMA specific SGSN functions====\n* Carry up to about 42&nbsp;Mbit/s traffic downlink and 5.8&nbsp;Mbit/s traffic uplink (HSPA+)\n* Tunnel/detunnel downlink/uplink packets toward the [[Radio Network Controller|radio network controller]] (RNC)\n*\n\n==Access point==\n{{main|Access Point Name}}\n\nAn access point is:\n* An IP network to which a mobile set can be connected\n* A set of settings which are used for that connection\n* A particular option in a set of settings in a mobile phone\n\nWhen a GPRS mobile phone sets up a PDP context, the access point\nis selected.  At this point an [[Access Point Name]] (APN) is\ndetermined\n\n:Example: aricenttechnologies.mnc012.mcc345.gprs\n:Example: geocell\n:Example: internet\n:Example: hcl.cisco.ggsn\n\nThis access point is then used in a [[Domain Name System|DNS]] query to a private DNS\nnetwork.  This process (called APN resolution) finally gives the IP\naddress of the GGSN which should serve the access point.  At this\npoint a PDP context can be activated.\n\n==PDP context==\nThe packet data protocol (PDP; e.g., IP, X.25, FrameRelay) context is a [[data structure]] present on both the ''serving GPRS support node'' (SGSN) and the ''gateway GPRS support node'' (GGSN) which contains the subscriber's session information when the subscriber has an active session.\nWhen a mobile wants to use GPRS, it must first attach and then ''activate a PDP context''.\nThis allocates a PDP context data structure in the SGSN that the subscriber is currently visiting and the GGSN serving the subscriber's access point.  The data recorded includes\n\n* Subscriber's [[IP address]]\n* Subscriber's [[International Mobile Subscriber Identity|IMSI]]\n* Subscriber's Tunnel Endpoint ID (TEID) at the GGSN\n* Subscriber's Tunnel Endpoint ID (TEID) at the SGSN\n\n==Reference points and interfaces==\nWithin the GPRS core network standards there are a number of [[Network interface device|interface]]s and reference points (logical points of connection which probably share a common physical connection with other reference points).  Some of these names can be seen in the network structure diagram on this page.\n\n===Interfaces in the GPRS network===\n\n;Ga: The interface serves the CDRs (accounting-records) which are written in the GSN and sent to the charging gateway (CG).  This interface uses a GTP-based protocol, with modifications that supports CDRs (Called ''GTP' '' and ''GTP prime'').\n;Gb: Interface between the [[base station subsystem]] and the SGSN the transmission protocol could be Frame Relay or IP.\n;Iu: Interface between the Radio Network Controller and the SGSN. The interface exchanges signaling and payload. \n;Gc: Interface between the [[GGSN]] and [[Home Location Register|HLR]] so that the GGSN can get the location details of a [[mobile station]]. To avoid implementing MAP/SS7 in the GGSN, this interface is optional. When not present, the GGSN routes inquires to the HLR via an [[SGSN]].\n;Gd: Interface between the SGSN and the SMS Gateway. Can use MAP1, MAP2 or MAP3.\n;Ge: The interface between the SGSN and the [[Service Control Point|service control point]] (SCP); uses the [[CAMEL Application Part|CAP]] protocol.\n;Gf: The interface between the SGSN and the Equipment Identity Register (EIR), used for checking the mobile's equipment identity number (IMEI) against a list of reported stolen mobile phones.\n;Gi: IP based interface between the GGSN and a public data network (PDN) either directly to the [[Internet]] or through a [[WAP gateway]].\n;Gmb: The interface between the GGSN and the Broadcast-Multicast Service Center (BM-SC), used for controlling MBMS bearers.\n;Gn: IP based interface between SGSN and other SGSNs and (internal) GGSNs. [[Domain Name System|DNS]] also shares this interface. Uses the GTP Protocol.\n;Gp: IP based interface between internal SGSN and external GGSNs. Between the SGSN and the external GGSN, there is the border gateway (which is essentially a [[firewall (networking)|firewall]]). Also uses the GTP Protocol.\n;Gr: Interface between the SGSN and the HLR. Messages going through this interface uses the MAP3 protocol.\n;Gs: Interface between the SGSN and the MSC (VLR). Uses the [[BSSAP|BSSAP+]] protocol. This interface allows paging and station availability when it performs data transfer. When the station is attached to the GPRS network, the SGSN keeps track of which routing area (RA) the station is attached to. An RA is a part of a larger location area (LA). When a station is paged this information is used to conserve network resources. When the station performs a PDP context, the SGSN has the exact BTS the station is using.\n;Gx: The on-line policy interface between the GGSN and the charging rules function (CRF). It is used for provisioning service data flow based on charging rules. Uses the diameter protocol.\n;Gy: The on-line charging interface between the GGSN and the [[online charging system]] (OCS). Uses the diameter protocol ([[Diameter Credit-Control Application|DCCA application]]).\n;Gz: The off-line ([[Call detail record|CDR]]-based) charging interface between the GGSN and the Charging system Uses GTP'.\n;Lg: The interface between the SGSN and the Gateway Mobile Location Center ([[GMLC]]), used for location-based services.\n;S3: This interface is defined between the SGSN and the MME and it is used to exchange user and bearer information in inter-system mobility procedures. This interface is implemented using [[GPRS Tunnelling Protocol#GTP-C - GTP control|eGTP-C]].\n;S4: This interface is defined between the SGSN and the SGW (Serving Gateway). The term \"S4-SGSN\" refers to a Release-8 SGSN that has at least one set of S4/S3/S16 interfaces enabled.<ref>3GPP TS 29.303 version 10.1.0 Release 10, p.7</ref>\n;S6d: The interface between SGSN and Home Subscriber Server (HSS). It is a [[Diameter (protocol)|Diameter]] based interface which is used for  transferring subscription and authentication data of the user to HSS for authenticating and authorizing user access.\n;S13': This interface is defined between the SGSN and the EIR (Equipment Identity Register). The S13' interface applies only to the S4-based SGSN.<ref>SAE and the Evolved Packet Core: Driving the Mobile Broadband Revolution, p. 365</ref> The interface is based on Diameter protocol.\n;S16: This interface is defined between two SGSNs and exclusively uses GTPv2-C.<ref>SAE and the Evolved Packet Core: Driving the Mobile Broadband Revolution, p. 237-238</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Base station subsystem]]\n** [[Base station subsystem#Packet control unit|Packet control unit]]\n* [[Network switching subsystem]]\n\n==References==\n{{More footnotes|date=March 2009}}\n{{Refimprove|date=March 2009}}\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n* [http://www.3gpp.org 3GPP web page including standards]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081030112056/http://www.3gpp.org/specs/numbering.htm easy access to different specs]\n* [http://www.eventhelix.com/RealtimeMantra/Telecom/gprs_attach_pdp_sequence_diagram.pdf GPRS attach and PDP context activation sequence diagrams]\n\n==Main Reference==\n* [http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/23_series/23.060/23060-d40.zip 3GPP TS 23.060 V13.4.0 (2015-09)]\n\n{{Mobile telecommunications standards}}\n{{Telecommunications}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gprs Core Network}}\n[[Category:3GPP standards]]\n[[Category:Telecommunications infrastructure]]\n", "name_user": "J00tel", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removed redundant word", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPRS_core_network"}

{"title_page": "Government of Alabama", "text_new": "[[File:Flag of Alabama.svg|thumb|300px|The flag of the state of Alabama]]\nThe '''government of Alabama''' is organized under the provisions of the 1901 [[Constitution of Alabama]], the lengthiest constitution of any political entity in the world.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20041130031023/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6596687/ Alabama Vote Opens Old Racial Wounds].  From MSNBC.</ref>  Like other [[U.S. state|states]] within the United States, Alabama's government is divided into executive, judicial, and legislative branches.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe Alabama Executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Alabama]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]], the [[Cabinet (government)|Governor's Cabinet]], several popularly elected executive officials, and the executive staff.  \n\n===Governor===\nThe Governor is the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the state's government. He or she (currently Governor Kay Ivey) is responsible for upholding the [[Alabama Constitution]] and executing [[state law]]. The Governor is elected by [[Direct election|popular election]] every four years. The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no [[term limit|limit]] on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. [[George Wallace]] holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.\n\nThe governor also is [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's military forces, which consist of the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]], which are part of the [[National Guard of the United States]]. As commander-in-chief, the governor may call out the state's military forces to preserve the public peace when it is not in active service of the United States. He may also call upon them to render aid during natural disasters or other times when he or she may deem their services to be required.\n\nThe governor of Alabama has power to [[veto]] laws passed by the state legislature (see below). However, in contrast to the practice in most states (and the federal government) that requires the legislature to garner a two-thirds majority to override an executive veto, the Alabama constitution requires only a majority within both legislative houses to accomplish this.  The governor also possesses the power to [[pardon]] convicted criminals, except in cases of [[impeachment]].\n\nAt least once every [[legislative session]], the governor is required to deliver an address to the [[Alabama Legislature]], referred to as the \"[[State of the State address]].\" This address encompasses the condition and operation of the [[State governments of the United States|state government]], and may also suggest new legislation for the legislature's consideration.\n\nThe Governor of Alabama is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]], who has served since 2017.\n\n===Lieutenant Governor===\nThe current Lieutenant governor is [[Will Ainsworth]] since 2019.\n\n===Independent executive officials===\nAlong with the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, the executive branch is composed of five other popularly elected officials, as well as the Superintendent of Education, who is chosen by the state school board:\n*[[Attorney General of Alabama]] [[Steve Marshall (politician)|Steve Marshall]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051109025131/http://www.ago.alabama.gov/bio.cfm ]</ref>\n*[[State Auditor of Alabama]] [[Jim Zeigler]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923180643/http://www.auditor.alabama.gov/about/biography.htm ]</ref>\n*[[Secretary of State of Alabama]] [[John Merrill (American politician)|John Merrill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sos-office/biography|title=Biography &#124; Alabama Secretary of State|website=www.sos.alabama.gov}}</ref>\n*[[State Treasurer of Alabama]] [[John McMillan (Alabama politician)|John McMillan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.alabama.gov/Content/About_Young_Boozer.htm|title=About Young Boozer|work=Alabama State Treasury}}</ref>\n*[[Superintendent of Education of Alabama]] Eric Mackey, Ed.D.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.alsde.edu/sites/boe/Pages/boardmembers-item.aspx?ID=500 |title=SBOE Member |accessdate=9 March 2018 |df= }}</ref>\n*[[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]] [[Rick Pate]] <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110131040355/http://agi.alabama.gov/about/meet-comm-mcmillan ]</ref>\n\nAll of the independent executive officials serve four-year terms that run concurrent with that of the Governor, who is currently Kay Ivey.\n\n===Cabinet members (as of April 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://governor.alabama.gov/administration/staff/|title=Staff &#124; Kay Ivey - Governor of Alabama}}</ref>===\n* The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n*Chief of Staff: Steve Pelham\n* Communications Director: Josh Pendergrass\n* Legal Advisor:  David Byrne\n* Director of Policy: David White\n* Legislative Director: Wesley Helton\n* Administrator of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board: H.

Bolin, Tom Parker, Brad Mendheim, Greg Shaw, James Allan Main, and Alisa Kelli Wise<ref name=\"supreme\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090618080929/http://judicial.alabama.gov/supreme.cfm ]</ref>). The Clerk of Court is Robert G. Esdale, Sr.<ref name=\"supreme\"/> As the highest state court, the Supreme Court has both judicial and administrative responsibilities. The court is housed in the [[Alabama Judicial Building|Heflin-Torbert Judicial Building]].\n\nThe Supreme Court has authority to review decisions rendered by the other courts of the state. It also has authority to determine certain legal matters over which no other court has jurisdiction, and to issue such orders as may prove necessary to carry out its general superintendence over the court system in Alabama. The Supreme Court of Alabama has exclusive jurisdiction over all appeals where the amount in controversy exceeds $50,000, as well as appeals from the [[Alabama Public Service Commission]].\n\nThe [[chief justice]] is the administrative head of the state's [[judicial system]].  The Supreme Court may make rules governing administration, practice, and procedure for all Alabama courts. Under this authority, uniform rules of practice and procedure and judicial administration have been adopted to eliminate many of the technicalities which cause delay in the trial courts, and needless reversals in the appellate courts.\n\n===Court of the Judiciary===\nA \"Court of the Judiciary\" is created under Alabama law, consisting of one judge of an appellate court (other than the Supreme Court), who shall be selected by the Supreme Court and shall serve as Chief Judge of the Court of the Judiciary. In addition, two judges of the circuit court are to be appointed to this body, who shall be selected by the Circuit Judges' Association; together with one district judge, who shall be selected by the District Judges' Association. Other members of the Court of the Judiciary are: two members of the state bar, who shall be selected by the governing body of the [[Alabama State Bar]]; three persons (as of 2005) who are not lawyers who shall be appointed by the Governor; and one person appointed by the Lieutenant Governor. Members appointed by the Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be subject to Senate confirmation before serving.\n\nThe Court of the Judiciary is convened to hear complaints filed by the Judicial Inquiry Commission. It has authority, after notice and public hearing, to impose one of two penalties:\n*To remove from office, suspend without pay, or censure a judge, or apply such other sanction as may be prescribed by law, for violation of a Canon of Judicial Ethics, misconduct in office, failure to perform his or her duties, or\n*To suspend with or without pay, or to retire a judge who is physically or mentally unable to perform his duties.<ref>''Constitution of Alabama of 1901, Amendment 581, \u00a76.18''.</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\n{{main|Alabama Legislature}}\nLike other states within the United States, Alabama has a [[State legislature (United States)|legislative branch]].\n\n===House of Representatives===\n{{main|Alabama House of Representatives}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama House of Representatives]] is composed of 105 members, all elected from single-member districts of equal population across the state in the same cycle.  Each member represents a district of approximately 40,000 people,<ref>Article IV, Section 50 of the [[Alabama Constitution]].</ref>  and is elected to a four-year term. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] is currently [[Mac McCutcheon (Alabama politician)|Mac McCutcheon]], a Republican.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/19981201234723/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/house/houseleaders.html ]</ref>  The current partisan line-up of the House of Representatives is 72 Republicans and 33 Democrats.\n\nAll revenue-raising matters must originate in the Alabama House. A majority of a quorum can pass any bill except a constitutional amendment, which requires a three-fifths vote of all those elected.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}\n\n===Senate===\n{{main|Alabama Senate}}\n\n====General information====\nThe [[Alabama Senate]] is composed of 35 Senators. Each Senator represents a single-member district of approximately 125,000 Alabamians.\n\nSenators must be at least 25 years of age at the time of their election, must be citizens and residents of the state of Alabama for at least 3 years, and reside within their district for at least one year prior to election.<ref>Article IV, Section 47 of the Alabama Constitution]</ref>\n\nAll Senators are elected for four-year terms in the same cycle as the House of Representatives, the Governor, and other statewide constitutional officers.\n\nWhile the House of Representatives has exclusive power to originate revenue bills, such legislation can be amended and/or substituted by the Senate. Moreover, because the Senate is historically considered to be the \"deliberative body\", its rules concerning length of debate are more relaxed than those of the House of Representatives.  The Senate also has a history of filibusters that the rules of the lower house do not as easily tolerate.\n\nThe Alabama Senate has sole power of Confirmation of certain appointees designated by the Constitution and by statute.\n\n===Legislative sessions===\n\n====Regular sessions====\nThe [[Alabama Legislature|Legislature]] convenes in regular annual sessions on the first Tuesday in February, except:\n\n*In the first year of the four-year term, when the session begins on the first Tuesday in March, and\n*In the last year of a four-year term, when the session begins on the second Tuesday in January.\n\nThe length of the regular session is limited to 30 meeting days within a period of 105 calendar days. Generally, two meeting or \"legislative\" days are held per week, with other days being devoted to committee meetings. The Alabama Constitution provides that no law shall be passed except by a bill, which is a proposed law written out in the proper format. Once approved in accordance with the state constitution, the bill becomes an act.\n\n====Special sessions====\nSpecial sessions of the Legislature may be called by the Governor, with the Proclamation listing those subjects that the Governor wishes to be considered in that session. These sessions are limited to twelve legislative days within a thirty calendar day span.  Whereas in a regular session bills may be enacted on any subject, in a special session, legislation must be enacted only on those subjects which the Governor announces in his proclamation or \"call.\" Anything not in the \"call\" requires a two-thirds vote of each house to be enacted.\n\nConstitutional amendments always require a three-fifths vote of the elected Members of each house for passage, whether in regular or special session, and this constitutional provision cannot be abrogated by any governor. Likewise, while a governor's proclamation may itemize subjects to be considered in a special session, the proclamation cannot dictate that the legislature specifically consider only a bill which mirrors the exact language of a bill offered in a previous session. The legislature may offer and consider any bills it chooses in a special session, subject to the above-stated requirements for passage (depending upon whether the subject of the bill formed part of the governor's \"call\", or whether it is a constitutional amendment).\n\n===Lawmaking process===\n{{main|State_legislature_(United_States)#Lawmaking_process}}\nAlabama's lawmaking process differs somewhat from the other 49 states.\n\n====Beginnings====\nEach bill may only pertain to one subject (which must be clearly stated in the title), \"except general appropriation bills, general revenue bills, and bills adopting a code, digest, or revision of statutes\".<ref>Alabama State Constitution, Article 4, Section 45</ref>\n\n====Committees====\n\n=====General information=====\nBills are referred to standing committees by the Lieutenant Governor and the President Pro Tempore in the Senate, and by the Speaker in the House of Representatives.\n\nThe Constitution states that each house shall determine the number of committees, and the numbers of committees vary from [[quadrennium|quadrennial session]] to session.\n\n=====Legislative Council=====\nThe Alabama legislature has a Legislative Council, which is a permanent or continuing interim committee, composed as follows:\n \n*From the Senate, the Lieutenant Governor and President Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Finance and Taxation, Rules, Judiciary, and Governmental Affairs, and six Senators elected by the Senate;\n*From the House of Representatives, the Speaker and Speaker Pro-Tempore, the Chairmen of Ways and Means, Rules, Judiciary, and Local Government, and six Representatives elected by the House.\n*The majority and minority leaders of each house.\n\nThe Legislative Council meets at least once quarterly to consider problems for which legislation may be needed, and to make recommendations for the next legislative session. A number of significant statutes have been placed on the Alabama law books as a result of this council's activity.\n\n====Post-committee====\n\n=====Reports of Committee=====\nAny bill which affects state funding by more than $1,000, and which involves expenditure or collection of revenue, must have a \"Fiscal Note\". Fiscal Notes are prepared by the Legislative Fiscal Office and signed by the chairman of the committee reporting the bill. They must contain projected increases or decreases to state revenue in the event that the bill becomes law.\n\n=====Third reading=====\nOnce the bill has been discussed, each member casts his or her vote as their name is called alphabetically. Since the state's Senate is rather small, voting may be done effectively in that house via manual roll call. An electronic voting machine is utilized in the House of Representatives.\n\nIf amendments are adopted, the bill is sent to the Enrolling and Engrossing Department of that house for engrossment. Engrossment is the process of incorporating amendments into the bill before transmittal to the second house.\n\n=====Conference committees=====\nA conference committee is empaneled to discusses the points of difference between the two houses' versions of the same bill, and tries to reach an agreement between them so that the identical bill can be passed by both houses.\n\nWhen a bill has passed both houses in identical form, it is enrolled. The \"enrolled\" copy is the official bill, which, after it becomes law, is kept by the Secretary of State for reference in the event of any dispute as to its exact language. The bill is then ready for transmittal to the Governor.\n\n=====Presentation to the governor=====\nOnce a bill reaches the governor, he or she may sign it, which completes its enactment into law.  From this point, the bill becomes an act, and remains the law of the state unless repealed by legislative action, or overturned by a court decision.  If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.  This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the Governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the Governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved by him within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\".  This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\nAlabama is one of the states in which the governor has the power to [[line item veto|accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without vetoing the entire bill]]. In this event, only the vetoed item of the appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced in the same manner as other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house.  Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n== Seals of the Government of Alabama ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of the Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Governor-Elect of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[President-elect|Governor-Elect]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Speaker of the House of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Speaker of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]\nFile:Seal of the Unified Judicial System of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Courts of Alabama|Unified Judicial System]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Attorney General of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Attorney General of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.svg|Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.svg|Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Corrections.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Corrections]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Homeland Security.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Homeland Security]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Health.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Health]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Safety.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Safety]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department.svg|Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department\nFile:Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Alabama National Guard.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama National Guard]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elections in Alabama]]\n*[[Courts of Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://governor.state.al.us/ Governor's Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920100305/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/ Legislature Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050917073603/http://www.judicial.state.al.us/ Judicial Office Website]\n*{{Ballotpedia|Alabama|Alabama}}\n\n{{Alabama}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}P.S.

From MSNBC.</ref>  Like other [[U.S. state|states]] within the United States, Alabama's government is divided into executive, judicial, and legislative branches.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe Alabama Executive branch consists of the [[Governor of Alabama]], the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]], the [[Cabinet (government)|Governor's Cabinet]], several popularly elected executive officials, and the executive staff.  The Cabinet consists of the heads of 25 different departments ranging from the Chief of Staff to the head of the [[Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources]].\n\n===Governor===\nThe Governor is the [[Head of government|chief executive]] of the state's government. He or she (currently Governor Kay Ivey) is responsible for upholding the [[Alabama Constitution]] and executing [[state law]]. The Governor is elected by [[Direct election|popular election]] every four years. The constitution limits the governor to two consecutive terms, but there is no [[term limit|limit]] on the total number of terms one may serve, so long as no more than two are ever consecutive. [[George Wallace]] holds the record as the longest-serving governor in Alabama history with 16 years of service.\n\nThe governor also is [[commander-in-chief]] of the state's military forces, which consist of the [[Alabama Army National Guard]] and [[Alabama Air National Guard]], which are part of the [[National Guard of the United States]]. As commander-in-chief, the governor may call out the state's military forces to preserve the public peace when it is not in active service of the United States. He may also call upon them to render aid during natural disasters or other times when he or she may deem their services to be required.\n\nThe governor of Alabama has power to [[veto]] laws passed by the state legislature (see below). However, in contrast to the practice in most states (and the federal government) that requires the legislature to garner a two-thirds majority to override an executive veto, the Alabama constitution requires only a majority within both legislative houses to accomplish this.  The governor also possesses the power to [[pardon]] convicted criminals, except in cases of [[impeachment]].\n\nAt least once every [[legislative session]], the governor is required to deliver an address to the [[Alabama Legislature]], referred to as the \"[[State of the State address]].\" This address encompasses the condition and operation of the [[State governments of the United States|state government]], and may also suggest new legislation for the legislature's consideration.\n\nThe Governor of Alabama is [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Kay Ivey]], who has served since 2017.\n\n===Lieutenant Governor===\nThe current Lieutenant governor is [[Will Ainsworth]] since 2019.\n\n===Independent executive officials===\nAlong with the Governor and the Lieutenant Governor, the executive branch is composed of five other popularly elected officials, as well as the Superintendent of Education, who is chosen by the state school board:\n*[[Attorney General of Alabama]] [[Steve Marshall (politician)|Steve Marshall]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20051109025131/http://www.ago.alabama.gov/bio.cfm ]</ref>\n*[[State Auditor of Alabama]] [[Jim Zeigler]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060923180643/http://www.auditor.alabama.gov/about/biography.htm ]</ref>\n*[[Secretary of State of Alabama]] [[John Merrill (American politician)|John Merrill]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.alabama.gov/sos-office/biography|title=Biography &#124; Alabama Secretary of State|website=www.sos.alabama.gov}}</ref>\n*[[State Treasurer of Alabama]] [[John McMillan (Alabama politician)|John McMillan]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.alabama.gov/Content/About_Young_Boozer.htm|title=About Young Boozer|work=Alabama State Treasury}}</ref>\n*[[Superintendent of Education of Alabama]] Eric Mackey, Ed.D.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.alsde.edu/sites/boe/Pages/boardmembers-item.aspx?ID=500 |title=SBOE Member |accessdate=9 March 2018 |df= }}</ref>\n*[[Alabama Commissioner of Agriculture and Industries]] [[Rick Pate]] <ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110131040355/http://agi.alabama.gov/about/meet-comm-mcmillan ]</ref>\n\nAll of the independent executive officials serve four-year terms that run concurrent with that of the Governor, who is currently Kay Ivey.\n\n===Cabinet members (as of April 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://governor.alabama.gov/administration/staff/|title=Staff &#124; Kay Ivey - Governor of Alabama}}</ref>===\n* Chief of Staff: Steve Pelham \n* Communications Director: Josh Pendergrass\n* Legal Advisor:  David Byrne\n* Director of Policy: David White\n* Legislative Director: Wesley Helton\n* Administrator of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Board: H.

If the governor does not approve of the bill, he or she may veto it.  In the event of a veto, the governor returns the bill to the house in which it originated, with a message explaining his objections and suggesting any amendments (if applicable) which might remove those objections.  The bill is then reconsidered, and if a simple majority of the members of both houses agrees to the proposed executive amendments, it is returned to the Governor, as he revised it, for his signature.\n\nOn the other hand, a simple majority of the members of each house can choose to approve a vetoed bill precisely as the Legislature originally passed it, in which case it becomes a law over the governor's veto.  This is in contrast to the practice in most states and the federal government, which require a two-thirds majority in both houses to override a governor's veto.\n\nIf the Governor fails to return a bill to the legislative house in which it originated within six days after it was presented to him or her (not including Sundays), it becomes a law without their signature.  This return can be prevented by recession of the Legislature. In that case the bill must be returned within two days after the legislature reassembles, or it becomes a law without the Governor's signature.\n\nThe bills that reach the Governor less than five days before the end of the session may be approved by him within ten days after adjournment. The bills not approved within that time do not become law. This is known as a \"pocket veto\".  This is the most conclusive form of veto, for the Legislature (having adjourned) has no chance to reconsider the vetoed measure.\n\nAlabama is one of the states in which the governor has the power to [[line item veto|accept or reject any particular item of an appropriation bill without vetoing the entire bill]]. In this event, only the vetoed item of the appropriation bill is returned to the house of origin for reconsideration by the Legislature. The remainder of the bill becomes law.\n\n====Constitutional amendments====\nSometimes what the legislature wishes to accomplish cannot be done simply by the passage of a bill, but rather requires amending the Constitution. A bill or joint resolution is accordingly drafted to propose an appropriate amendment to the Constitution. This bill or joint resolution is introduced in the same manner as other bills and resolutions, and follows the course of ordinary bills, except that it must be read at length on three different days in each house.  Furthermore, it must be passed in each house by a three-fifths vote of all the members elected, and does not require the approval of the governor. A constitutional amendment passed by the legislature is deposited directly with the Secretary of State. It is then submitted to the voters of the state at an election (the time of which is fixed by the Legislature), held not less than three months after the adjournment of the session in which the amendment was proposed. The governor announces the election by proclamation, and the proposed amendment and notice of the election must be published in every county for four successive weeks before the election. If a majority of those who vote at the election favor the amendment, it becomes a part of the Constitution. The result of the election is announced by proclamation of the governor.\n\n== Seals of the Government of Alabama ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Seal of the Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Lieutenant Governor of Alabama.svg|[[Seals of the Governors of the U.S. States|Seal]] of the [[Lieutenant Governor of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Governor-Elect of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[President-elect|Governor-Elect]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Speaker of the House of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Speaker of the [[Alabama House of Representatives]]\nFile:Seal of the Unified Judicial System of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Courts of Alabama|Unified Judicial System]] of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Attorney General of Alabama.svg|Seal of the [[Attorney General of Alabama]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles.svg|Seal of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency.svg|Seal of the Alabama Emergency Management Agency\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Corrections.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Corrections]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Homeland Security.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Homeland Security]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Labor\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Health.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Health]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Public Safety.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama Department of Public Safety]]\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation.svg|Seal of the Alabama Department of Transportation\nFile:Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department.svg|Seal of the Alabama Treasury Department\nFile:Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama.svg|Seal of the Securities Commission of Alabama\nFile:Seal of the Alabama National Guard.svg|Seal of the [[Alabama National Guard]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Elections in Alabama]]\n*[[Courts of Alabama]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://governor.state.al.us/ Governor's Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050920100305/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/ Legislature Office Website]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050917073603/http://www.judicial.state.al.us/ Judicial Office Website]\n*{{Ballotpedia|Alabama|Alabama}}\n\n{{Alabama}}\n{{Governments of the United States}}\n\n[[Category:Government of Alabama| ]]\n[[Category:State governments of the United States|Alabama]]\n", "name_user": "AveryRedPandaGirl", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(i love red pandas)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Alabama"}

They were created by [[H. B. Reese]], a former [[dairy farmer]] and shipping foreman for [[Milton S. Hershey]]. Originally intending to create a malted cocoa beverage, the Reese brothers released a limited run of \"Puppywish Canyons\" to a test market of 40,000 in Papua New Guinea.  Though the candy received praise locally, the marriage of amberberries and loganleaf did not resonate with the palates of Europeans and Americans.  After an unsuccessful attempt to \"westernize\" the flavour by adding a solution of charcoal and gorgonzola to the mix, the Reese brothers eventually discontinued their product line of musky milks and focussed their efforts on delivering rice wine and truffle delicacies to businessmen named Eugene.  Reese left his job at [[The Hershey Company]] to start his own candy business.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2013/06/the-history-of-reeses-peanut-butter-cups/ |title=The History of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups |publisher=Today I Found Out |date=June 5, 2013 |accessdate=March 17, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==The H.B.
