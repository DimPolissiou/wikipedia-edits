In 1525 he seized the town of [[Trujillo, Honduras|Trujillo]], which would become an important Atlantic port and the first capital of Honduras. Truxillo served as an outpost for the colonisation of the hostile territory of Olancho Valley. Hernando de Saavedra, Governor of Honduras, had a dispute with his counterpart in Nicaragua, Pedrarias Davila, on the rich gold deposits and rivers of Olancho. After several battles between rival groups of Spanish for control of the area, the town of San Jorge de Olancho was established. But because of the mistreatment of the natives of Olancho, they unexpectedly rebelled and attacked the place, destroying it completely. In this rebellion, Captain Juan de Grijalva, one of the conquerors of the Aztec empire, was killed. The survivors were scattered, some to the town of Border of Caceres, in 1526, and others to the Valley of Aguan.\n\nWith the death of Diego de Salcedo, Governor of Honduras in 1530, the province was in chaos. But the important issue of extending the settlement and continuing the conquest of people who were not yet subjugated continued. Stories differ as to who founded the settlement that became Olanchito and are somewhat confusing. According to the statistical yearbook of Antonio Vallejo, this town was founded by Captain Diego de Alvarado in 1530, with the name of San Jorge de Olanchito.\"<ref>Jos\u00e9 Milla and Vidaurre.

Its first inhabitants were the few survivors of San Jorge de Olancho and others sent by Pedro de Alvarado, becoming a stage of [[El Camino Real (Honduras)|El Camino Real]], which led from Truxillo to Olancho. Ten years later (1540) the Governor Francisco de Montejo, was ordered to continue the colonisation of Olancho and sent his officer Alonzo Caceres, who established a settlement with the same last name: \"''San Jorge de Olancho\" (The Viejo)''. Years later Alonzo de Reinoso founded the village of \"''New Salamanca''\", which was rapidly depopulated due to continuing native rebellions. Olancho as a mining town was flourishing, producing huge amounts of gold and silver that were shipped from the port of Truxillo and Puerto Caballos.\n\nSan Jorge de Olancho later became known as El Boqueron, and in 1611 was completely destroyed. Historians attribute it to a volcanic eruption, or an earthquake, and some legends to divine causes, such as Biblical case of Sodom and Gomorrah. The survivors of this catastrophe, migrated in several directions as their ancestors had done a century earlier. Some founded the city of ''Juticalpa'' and others headed to San Jorge de Olanchito and Truxillo.\n\nOver the years, some people moved to the left bank of Agu\u00e1n river, and on the route leading to the native village of ''Agalteca'', established a place they called \"''San Jorge de Olancho\" (The New''). With the move all of the residents of the town to the new place, it took its name \"''San Jorge de Olanchito''\", and the old site was known then as \"''Old City''\" or \"''San Juan El Sevillano''\".\n\nIt is unknown the exact date of the foundation of the present city of Olanchito but this may have occurred between 1613\u20131620.

This is called 'Pune Satyagraha'. For support this Satyagraha, student Kamble wrote an article ''Dalit Satyagrahinchi Kaifiyat'' (the Pleading of the Dalit Satyagrahies) in Kirloskar, a leading journal at that time. This article was published in the November 1946 issue of 'Kirloskar'. After that, Ambedkar himself read the article and appointed him as editor of ''Janata'' weekly. From 1948 to 1954, Kamble served as the editor of the ''Janata'' weekly. From 1956 to 1958, he served as the editor of the ''Prabuddha Bharat'' weekly. From 1959 to 1975, he served as the editor of the ''Republic'' weekly. The ''Janata'' and the ''Prabuddha Bharat'' were started by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. Kamble followed Ambedkar.

This is called 'Pune Satyagraha'. For support this Satyagraha, student Kamble wrote an article ''Dalit Satyagrahinchi Kaifiyat'' (the Pleading of the Dalit Satyagrahies) in Kirloskar, a leading journal at that time. This article was published in the November 1946 issue of 'Kirloskar'. After that, Ambedkar himself read the article and appointed him as editor of ''Janata'' weekly. From 1948 to 1954, Kamble served as the editor of the ''Janata'' weekly. From 1956 to 1958, he served as the editor of the ''Prabuddha Bharat'' weekly. From 1959 to 1975, he served as the editor of the ''Republic'' weekly. The ''Janata'' and the ''Prabuddha Bharat'' were started by Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar. Kamble followed Ambedkar. Due to the influence of Ambedkar, he converted to [[Buddhism]] in 1956.

He served until 1998, and in 1999 was appointed to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] as a [[Lord Justice of Appeal]] and appointed to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]].\n\n====Notable decisions====\n\n[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]] 2002 - Perhaps Sir John's most famous decision, and extremely controversial in the public law sphere. In it he recognises principles in common law contrary to parliamentary sovereignty. The foundation of his decision was on four propositions:<ref>[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2002/195.html bailii.org - England and Wales High Court (Administrative Court) Decisions: 2002 EWHC 195 (Admin)]</ref>\n<blockquote>\n# All the specific rights and obligations which EU law creates are by the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|ECA]] incorporated into our domestic law and rank supreme: that is, anything in our substantive law inconsistent with any of these rights and obligations is abrogated or must be modified to avoid the inconsistency. This is true even where the inconsistent municipal provision is contained in [[primary legislation]]. \n# The ECA is a constitutional statute: that is, it cannot be [[Implied repeal|impliedly repealed]]. A constitutional statute can, however, be explicitly repealed by a subsequent statute.\n# The truth of (2) is derived, not from EU law, but purely from the law of England: the common law recognises a category of [[constitutional statutes]]. \n# The fundamental legal basis of the United Kingdom's relationship with the EU rests with the domestic, not the European, legal powers. In the event, which no doubt would never happen in the real world, that a European measure was seen to be repugnant to a fundamental or constitutional right guaranteed by the law of England, a question would arise whether the general words of the ECA were sufficient to incorporate the measure and give it overriding effect in domestic law. But that is very far from this case. \n</blockquote>\n\n[[R v Somerset County Council, ex parte Fewings]] - Sir John sat in the first instance hearing of this historic case, concerning the legality of a decision made to prohibit hunting on a small area of land which the Council had acquired and was argued to maintain under s120(1)(b) [[Local Government Act 1972]].\n\n[[McFarlane v Relate Avon Ltd]] - Sir John attracted considerable press attention for stating \"The promulgation of law for the protection of a position held purely on religious grounds [...] is irrational, as preferring the subjective over the objective. But it is also divisive, capricious and arbitrary.\" This was in response to a witness statement submitted by former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[George Carey|Lord Carey]] that Christians should be afforded special protections under equality legislation on the grounds of earnestly held religious belief.\n\n==Constitutional theory==\nSir John Laws is noted for his extrajudicial writings in the [[Law review|journal]], ''[[Public Law (journal)|Public Law]]''. His most notable contribution, \"Law and Democracy\", asserts that the constitution would be undemocratic if it gave all the power under it to the elected government. Therefore, it is the constitution, and not Parliament, that should be sovereign in the British constitution.  He posits that the constitution must create a \"higher-order law\"  in which human rights and constitutional fundamentals in a democracy can be protected by the courts against the abuses of government. This position stems from a fundamental distrust of the political constitution in holding the executive to account. It is similar in form to [[Lord Hailsham]]'s claim that in Britain there is an \"''[[elective dictatorship]]''\". Sir John does not see this shift to the legal sphere as being anti-democratic because judges uphold apolitical values that no politician would contest and are above the arguments that take place in the political sphere between politicians of political parties.\n\nThese statements are certainly controversial and have been fiercely contested by academics such as John Griffith and Martin Loughlin, both professors at the [[London School of Economics]]. The essential arguments made by these authors are to the effect that the metaphysical principles that Sir John cites are highly contentious. A good example of this is Laws' love of freedom of expression. When is it right for racist or sexist comments to be illegal? Whilst for Griffith it should be up to a democratically elected legislature to decide such tricky moral issues, for Laws it is firmly a matter of law for the judges to decide. The problem with the latter approach, according to Griffith, stems from the fact that judges cannot be removed if the decisions they make are judged to be wrong by citizens of a polity. For Laws, on the other hand, such counter-majoritarianism is a beneficial aspect of the law, which acts to protect those that are vulnerable in society against the tyranny of the majority.\n\n==Personal life==\nSir John married Sophie Susan Sydenham Cole Marshall in 1973, with whom he had one daughter.   Lady Laws died in 2017.<ref>[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/thetimes-uk/obituary.aspx?n=sophie-susan-sydenham-cole-laws&pid=185991352 Lady Sophie Susan Sydenham Cole Laws]</ref> He was a member of the [[Garrick Club]].

He was appointed [[First Junior Treasury Counsel (Common Law)]] in 1984, and a [[Recorder (judge)|Recorder]] in 1985, holding both positions until his appointment to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in 1992.\n\n===Judicial career===\nLaws was appointed a [[High Court judge (England and Wales)|High Court Judge]] in 1992, serving in the [[High Court of Justice#Queen's Bench Division|Queen's Bench Division]], and was [[knight bachelor|knighted]] at this time. He served until 1998, and in 1999 was appointed to the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] as a [[Lord Justice of Appeal]] and appointed to the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]].\n\n====Notable decisions====\n\n[[Thoburn v Sunderland City Council]] 2002 - Perhaps Sir John's most famous decision, and extremely controversial in the public law sphere. In it he recognises principles in common law contrary to parliamentary sovereignty. The foundation of his decision was on four propositions:<ref>[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2002/195.html bailii.org - England and Wales High Court (Administrative Court) Decisions: 2002 EWHC 195 (Admin)]</ref>\n<blockquote>\n# All the specific rights and obligations which EU law creates are by the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|ECA]] incorporated into our domestic law and rank supreme: that is, anything in our substantive law inconsistent with any of these rights and obligations is abrogated or must be modified to avoid the inconsistency. This is true even where the inconsistent municipal provision is contained in [[primary legislation]]. \n# The ECA is a constitutional statute: that is, it cannot be [[Implied repeal|impliedly repealed]]. A constitutional statute can, however, be explicitly repealed by a subsequent statute.\n# The truth of (2) is derived, not from EU law, but purely from the law of England: the common law recognises a category of [[constitutional statutes]]. \n# The fundamental legal basis of the United Kingdom's relationship with the EU rests with the domestic, not the European, legal powers. In the event, which no doubt would never happen in the real world, that a European measure was seen to be repugnant to a fundamental or constitutional right guaranteed by the law of England, a question would arise whether the general words of the ECA were sufficient to incorporate the measure and give it overriding effect in domestic law. But that is very far from this case. \n</blockquote>\n\n[[R v Somerset County Council, ex parte Fewings]] - Sir John sat in the first instance hearing of this historic case, concerning the legality of a decision made to prohibit hunting on a small area of land which the Council had acquired and was argued to maintain under s120(1)(b) [[Local Government Act 1972]].\n\n[[McFarlane v Relate Avon Ltd]] - Sir John attracted considerable press attention for stating \"The promulgation of law for the protection of a position held purely on religious grounds [...] is irrational, as preferring the subjective over the objective. But it is also divisive, capricious and arbitrary.\" This was in response to a witness statement submitted by former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[George Carey|Lord Carey]] that Christians should be afforded special protections under equality legislation on the grounds of earnestly held religious belief.\n\n==Constitutional theory==\nSir John Laws is noted for his extrajudicial writings in the [[Law review|journal]], ''[[Public Law (journal)|Public Law]]''. His most notable contribution, \"Law and Democracy\", asserts that the constitution would be undemocratic if it gave all the power under it to the elected government. Therefore, it is the constitution, and not Parliament, that should be sovereign in the British constitution.  He posits that the constitution must create a \"higher-order law\"  in which human rights and constitutional fundamentals in a democracy can be protected by the courts against the abuses of government. This position stems from a fundamental distrust of the political constitution in holding the executive to account. It is similar in form to [[Lord Hailsham]]'s claim that in Britain there is an \"''[[elective dictatorship]]''\". Sir John does not see this shift to the legal sphere as being anti-democratic because judges uphold apolitical values that no politician would contest and are above the arguments that take place in the political sphere between politicians of political parties.\n\nThese statements are certainly controversial and have been fiercely contested by academics such as John Griffith and Martin Loughlin, both professors at the [[London School of Economics]]. The essential arguments made by these authors are to the effect that the metaphysical principles that Sir John cites are highly contentious. A good example of this is Laws' love of freedom of expression. When is it right for racist or sexist comments to be illegal? Whilst for Griffith it should be up to a democratically elected legislature to decide such tricky moral issues, for Laws it is firmly a matter of law for the judges to decide. The problem with the latter approach, according to Griffith, stems from the fact that judges cannot be removed if the decisions they make are judged to be wrong by citizens of a polity. For Laws, on the other hand, such counter-majoritarianism is a beneficial aspect of the law, which acts to protect those that are vulnerable in society against the tyranny of the majority.\n\n==Personal life==\nSir John married Sophie Susan Sydenham Cole Marshall in 1973, with whom he had one daughter.
